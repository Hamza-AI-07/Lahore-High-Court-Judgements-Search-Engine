Mr. Umar Sharif, Advocate for petitioner.  
 
Respondents ex parte. 
  
 
This judgment will decide civil revision 
wherein the judgments and decree of the courts 
below dismissing the suit for recovery filed by the 
petitioner and also the appeal thereagainst have 
been challenged. 
2. 
Petitioner instituted a suit against Fazal 
Hussain, now deceased and represented by 
respondents, claiming that he was a consumer of 
the petitioner utility company; that there was some 
error in calculation of bills; that on detection of the 
error suit amount was concluded to be due against 
the respondent which he was required to pay and 
on failure to discharge it gas supply was 
disconnected; and that recovery of amount was due 
as short-payment against running bills for the gas 
supplied. The suit was contested by the legal heirs 
of respondent who denied their responsibility by 
asserting that all the payments, as claimed by the 
department, had been fully discharged and that 
they 
could 
not 
be 
held 
liable 
for 
any 
miscalculation, if made, by the meter-reader or 
other staff of petitioner. Issues were framed and 
evidence was recorded. The suit was dismissed by 
the learned Civil Judge vide judgment and decree 
dated 27.1.2012 which was affirmed in appeal vide 

       
C.R. No.1169 of 2013  
 
 
 
   -2- 
 
 
 
judgment dated 31.10.2013 by learned Addl. 
District Judge, Wazirabad. 
3. 
   Learned 
counsel 
submitted 
that 
the 
impugned judgments were untenable as the courts 
below overlooked the oral as well as documentary 
evidence, in particular, the Gas Sales Contract 
(Ex.P-5) and that the evidence produced by the 
petitioner including the consumption data supported 
the case of the petitioner which was unjustifiably 
dismissed and that the judgment of the appellate 
court did not satisfy the requirements of law. 
Respondents were proceeded against ex parte vide 
Order dated 16.10.2023. 
4. 
  Perusal of the judgments of the courts 
below reveals that the points raised in appeal are 
well- founded. The case set up in the plaint was 
that a sum of Rs.4,15,986/- was recoverable from 
the respondents as short payment against gas 
consumed which was on account of a mistake on 
the part of meter-reader had been incorrectly 
recorded resulting in under-billing and that on 
detection necessary inquiry was made and 
ultimately it was found that the amount claimed in 
the suit was payable as short-payment against the 
actual dues for gas consumed in terms of the 
contract. Petitioner produced oral and documentary 
evidence including statements of Ghulam Sarwar 
as PW-1, Muhammad Anwar as PW-2 and 
Muhammad Sharif as PW-3 and documents Ex.P-1 
to  Ex.P-9. In defence respondent produced one 
Waheed Hussain as DW-1 and did not produce any 
other oral or documentary evidence. The findings 
recorded by the learned Civil Judge were to the 

       
C.R. No.1169 of 2013  
 
 
 
   -3- 
 
 
 
effect that on account of any fault on the part of 
meter-reader the respondent could not be held 
responsible and that no show cause notice or 
hearing was given to the consumer and that no 
proceedings were conducted by the department 
against the meter-reader nor any inquiry was held, 
therefore, 
respondent 
could 
not 
be 
made 
responsible for the claimed amount. These findings 
were assailed on a number of grounds viz. that the 
findings on issue No. 5 were baseless; that 
evidence was not considered properly by the trial 
court; that under the Gas Supply Contract 
consumer was bound to pay the dues as determined 
by the company/department; that the suit itself was 
a notice; that documentary evidence proving the 
under-billing was illegally ignored; and that it was 
a case of no rebuttal; and that any mistake  in the 
process of calculation of gas-charges could not 
extinguish the liability of the consumer to pay the 
dues against the actual supply at the contractually 
agreed rate.  
5. 
    Scrutiny of the judgment of the appellate 
court shows that the entire evidence was ignored, 
the questions raised in appeal were completely 
bypassed and the appeal was dismissed with 
observation that there was no allegation of meter 
tampering or gas theft and that the fault was of the 
meter-reader for which the consumer could not be 
held responsible. Neither the Gas Sales Contract 
(Ex.P-5) was considered nor were the documents 
adduced given any consideration and appeal was 
decided in oblivion of entire oral and documentary 
evidence on record. As such and on due 

       
C.R. No.1169 of 2013  
 
 
 
   -4- 
 
 
 
consideration there is substance in the submission 
of learned counsel for the petitioner that the 
appellate court did not follow the provisions of law 
and decided the appeal without considering the 
oral and documentary evidence or the material 
questions of law that arose in the case. Question 
necessitating analysis included as to whether the 
department could under the contract recover the 
amount claimed; what were the agreed terms and 
conditions 
of 
the 
contract; 
whether 
the 
respondent/consumer 
could 
avoid 
the 
responsibility to pay the amount; whether the 
evidence produced by the petitioner factually 
established short-billing; and whether any mistake 
in recording the billing charges incorrectly could 
exonerate the consumer to avoid liability on 
detection of under-billing. For the purpose Gas 
Sales Contract (Ex.P-5) was material document. 
Relevant part of sub-clause (ii) of clause 15 
whereof is as under:  
 “(i)… 
  (ii)… Any mistake  in the bills or incorrect billing 
shall not entitle the consumer to withhold payment of 
the bills in time. Provided however, if the Company 
finds any mistakes in the bill sent to the Consumer, 
then irrespective of the fact whether payment  has 
been made or not, the Company  shall, upon 
having discovered the mistake at any time, be 
entitled to send a correct bill and the consumer 
shall be liable to pay the same.”  
 
 
 
            (emphasis supplied) 
Record shows that the petitioner produced Ghulam 
Sarwar, Superintendent-Billing as PW-1 who 
produced the bill as Ex.P-1 and deposed that he 
had prepared the said bill. Muhammad Anwar, 
Meter-Reader/Inspector as PW-2 deposed in 
respect of the circumstances in which the under-

       
C.R. No.1169 of 2013  
 
 
 
   -5- 
 
 
 
billing took place and the mistake was detected. 
Muhammad Sharif, Deputy Foreman (PW-3) 
appeared as PW-3 in support of the case of 
department. He deposed about the procedure for 
charging the gas-bills. Documents Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-
8 were tendered in evidence which included the 
final bill as Ex.P-4, Notices as Ex.P-6, Ex.P-7 and 
Ex.P-8 and Ex.P-9 as the computerized final bill. 
The learned Addl. District Judge did not consider 
the evidence on record to determine the questions 
raised supra instead casually observed that it was 
the fault of meter-reader who could be held 
responsible and that demand from the consumer 
was not legally justified. The judgment recorded 
without considering the evidence cannot be 
approved as it violates the provision of Rule 31 of 
Order XLI, C.P.C. which contemplates that the 
appellate court shall deliver the judgment in 
writing and shall state points for determination, the 
decision thereof and the reasons for the decision. 
The appellate court in first appeal is duty-bound to 
consider the case de novo for reaching a 
conclusion. In Nasir Abbas v. Manzoor Haider 
Shah (PLD 1989 SC 568) it was observed as 
under: 
“11.  The submission of the learned counsel for 
the appellants is correct that except nothing the 
submissions of the learned counsel for the parties 
and referring to the certain pieces of evidence 
which have been mentioned hereinbefore the first 
appellate Court has not considered the entire 
evidence which was referred to and discussed by 
the trial court in its judgment. Nowhere the first 
appellate Court  has referred  to or discussed the 
evidence of Khan Zaman (D.W.3)  which has been 
mentioned above and the evidence of Khalid 
Mahmud Malik fully. It is settled that if the 

       
C.R. No.1169 of 2013  
 
 
 
   -6- 
 
 
 
evidence on the record has not been fully weighed 
and considered, that does not fulfil the 
requirements of O. 41, R 31, and is liable to be set 
aside on revision.  See Mathra Dass and others v. 
Muharram Din and others (AIR 1915 Lah. 242). 1  
It is also settled that if the lower Court, misreads 
the evidence on record  and fails to take notice of 
a vital fact appearing  therein, comes to an 
erroneous conclusion, it would be deemed to have 
acted with material irregularity and its decision is 
open to revision by the High Court.” 
In Gul Rehman v. Gul Nawaz Khan (2009 SCMR 
589) it was observed that: 
„8. 
Regarding duties of the Appellate Court, 
specially the first Appellate Court, learned 
Narayan, J, in paragraph 22 of judgment in the 
case of Sailajananda Pandey and another (supra) 
has clearly stated that “it has been repeatedly 
pointed out that the legislature has entrusted a 
very important duty to the first appellate Court. It is 
for that Court to decide finally all questions of fact 
on which the disposal of the suit might depend 
and the appellate Court should not easily agree 
with the trial Court simply because it was not 
inclined to take much trouble over the case. If the 
lower Appellate Court  does not examine the facts 
and the evidence for itself and does not even 
mention the points which the case raises, it will be 
certainly failing in its duty” . In the instant case, a 
bare perusal of the judgment of the first appellate 
Court clearly reflects that it has not given due 
attention to the available evidence on record. 
Three important statements of witnesses i.e. 
Doulat Khan P.W.2, Gul Nawaz Khan plaintiff, 
P.W.3  and his son Muhammad Nisar P.W.4  are 
available on record and the appellate Court should 
have thrashed statements of these three important 
witnesses and then should have come to a definite 
conclusion. The judgment of the appellate Court  
in hand is not a judgment on its true sense and it 
is even admitted by the High Court that the first 
appellant court has followed the path least 
resistant. The appellant court should have applied 
Order XLI,  rule 31, C.P.C.  in stricto senso as it 
has got ample powers under Order XLI,  rules 32 
and 33,  C.P.C. For convenience sake rule 33 of 
Order XLI is reproduced below:- 

       
C.R. No.1169 of 2013  
 
 
 
   -7- 
 
 
 
“33- Power of Court of appeal:- The Appellate 
Court shall have power to pass any decree and 
make any order which ought to have been passed 
or made and to pass or make such further or other 
decree or order as the case may require and this 
power 
may be 
exercised 
by 
the 
Court 
notwithstanding that the appeal is as to part only 
of the decree and may be exercised in favour of all 
or any of the respondents or parties although such 
respondents or parties may not have filed any 
appeal or objection: 
Provided that the Appellate Court  shall not make 
any order under section 35-A in pursuance of any 
objection on which the Court from whose decree 
the appeal is preferred has omitted or refused to 
make such order” 
We are convinced that the first appellate Court, which 
is ultimate Court of facts, has not done its legal duty.‟ 
6. 
  Reference can also be made to the case of 
Mst.  Sarwar Bano through Attorney v. Province 
Of Sindh through Member Board of Revenue, 
Hyderabad and 5 others (PLD 2015 Sindh 445) 
where it was observed to the effect that the 
appellate court having not discussed the evidence 
brought on record, the judgment of appellate court 
would not qualify the meaning of “judgment”. In 
Abdul Hameed and 7 others v. Abdul Razzaq and 
3 others (PLD 2008 Lah. 1) it was observed to the 
effect that the judgment of appellate court shall be 
error free, concise, consistent, coherent and 
comprehensible 
irrespective 
of 
the 
stylistic 
differences and that the principles, parameters and 
requirements of a judgment are that judgment 
should contain a concise statement of case, points 
for determination, decision thereon and reasons for 
such decision manifesting application of mind to 
resolve the issue involved which ought to be self-
contained, unambiguous, easily intelligible, lucid, 

       
C.R. No.1169 of 2013  
 
 
 
   -8- 
 
 
 
open only to one interpretation and thus leaving 
nothing to guesswork or probabilities on matters 
under determination and should also be self-
speaking, well-reasoned and analytical reflecting  
due consideration of facts, law and contentions of 
the parties founded on legal grounds and the 
evidence on record. Reference can also be made to 
the case of Gul Muhammad v. Kiamuddin (2012 
YLR 218) where it was observed as follows:   
“8. The statutory right of appeal confers the right of 
rehearing the whole dispute unless expressly 
restricted in its scope and the appellate court, is not 
confined to the reasons which have been given by 
the subordinate court or the grounds for its 
decision. The right of appeal is a substantive and 
vested right and not as a matter of mere procedure. 
According to Order XLI, rule 31, C.P.C. it is 
mandatory that judgment passed by the appellate 
court shall state the points for  determination, the 
decision thereon, the reasons for the decision  and 
where the decree appealed from is reversed or 
varied, the relief to which  the appellant is entitled. 
This rule makes it apparent that for just and proper 
decision, the appellate court should state the points 
for determination and apply its independent judicial 
mind to the controversy involved between the 
parties and also examine the record for the 
purposes of pronouncing its judgment. The phrase 
“points for determination” refers to all important 
questions involved in the case, therefore, this rule 
has been incorporated in the Code for framing the 
points for determination so that the judgment 
should be self-explanatory, illuminative and in the 
nature of a speaking order. 
9. 
Every finding of fact is not immune from 
interference in revisional jurisdiction when the 
Courts below commit jurisdictional illegality and this 
concept of jurisdictional illegality has been 
considered by the honourable Supreme Court in 
the case of Kanwal Nain PLD 1983 SC 53 and held 
that to cover cases where decision on facts is 
based on no evidence or inadmissible  evidence or 
is so perverse that grave injustice would result, 
revisional  jurisdiction is justified when the findings 

       
C.R. No.1169 of 2013  
 
 
 
   -9- 
 
 
 
are based on conjectural presumptions, erroneous 
assumptions of facts and wrong proposition of law 
and where unreasonable view on evidence has 
been taken . In 2010 SCMR 786, Brig. (R) Sher 
Afghan .vs. Mst. Sheeren Tahira and others, it was 
held that by now a well-settled principle of exercise 
of revisional jurisdiction under section 115 CPC is 
that if a finding of first Court of Appeal is based on 
no evidence or is arbitrary and fallacious, the 
Revisional Court is not denuded of its power to 
interfere with such a finding. This view was 
reiterated in Naziran Begum.vs. Khurshid Begum 
1999  SCMR 1171 wherein it was held  a finding on 
a question of fact arrived at by the First Appellate 
Court which is based on no evidence or is the 
result  of conjectures or fallacious appraisal of 
evidence on record is not immune from scrutiny by 
the High Court in exercise of its power under 
section 100 or 115 C.P.C. In  2008 SCMR 1454 
(Nabi Bakhsh.vs. Fazal Hussain), it was held that 
no exception  could be taken to the exercise  of 
revisional powers and setting aside of the findings 
of the lower courts even if they be concurrent  if it 
had found that the said findings were based on 
misreading or non- reading of the material available 
on record. Similarly, in  2007 SCMR 838 (Ch. 
Muhammad Shafi. vs. Shamim Khanum) it was 
held that First Appellate Court has a right to 
reverse the finding/conclusions of the trial court 
while exercising power under section 96 of  the 
C.P.C.  subject to the condition that First Appellate 
Court has to meet the reasoning of the trial Court in 
the first instance and thereafter reappraise the 
evidence on record while reversing the finding of 
the trial Court as law laid down by this court in 
Madan Gopal‟s case PLD 1969 SC 617. The High 
Court has wide power to reverse the finding of the 
First Appellate Court while exercising power under 
section 115 C.P.C. having supervisory jurisdiction.” 
In Punjab Industrial Development Board v. United 
Sugar Mills Limited (2007 SCMR 1394) it was 
observed  to the effect that it is duty of the 
appellate court to decide the controversy between 
the parties after application of independent judicial 
mind and that mere reproduction of the judgment 
of trial court and thereafter dismissing the appeal 

       
C.R. No.1169 of 2013  
 
 
 
   -10- 
 
 
 
could not be in consonance with the law  and that 
after the insertion of section 24-A in the General 
Clauses Act, 1894, even the public functionaries 
are duty bound to decide the applications of 
citizens while exercising statutory powers with 
reasons after judicial application of mind. 
7. 
  On the touchstone of rule supra, it is 
manifest that in the instant case the court below did 
not take the trouble of looking into the evidence 
and thereafter recording findings by giving reasons 
for the conclusions drawn. It was ignored that mere 
mistake of the departmental representative in 
process of calculation of bill could not be a ground 
to exonerate the consumer from paying the actual 
dues for consumption of gas and that the liability 
was to be regulated by terms agreed in the 
contract. The material questions inter alia required 
to be determined were as to whether the 
department could prove any short payment or 
under-billing and that whether the subsequent bills 
were factually correct and whether the supporting 
evidence could establish the actual dues as claimed 
in the plaint by the petitioner and it was only after 
attending to these questions that the matter could 
be decided by appellate court one way or the other. 
The learned Addl. District Judge did not deem it 
necessary to look into the evidence and thereafter 
determine 
controversy, 
rather, 
hypothetical 
assumptions were relied upon in disposal of the 
appeal which does not have any support of law. 
8. 
For the reasons supra, the revision petition is 
accepted, the judgment dated 31.10.2013 of the 
appellate court is set aside and the matter is 

       
C.R. No.1169 of 2013  
 
 
 
   -11- 
 
 
 
remanded to the appellate court for decision 
afresh by considering the points raised for 
determination, the evidence on the file and 
recording the reasons by attending to the questions 
raised supra in this judgment, in accordance with 
law.
