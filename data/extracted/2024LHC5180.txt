F. A. O. No. 68769 of 2017 
 
Javed Ahmad Shafqat  
versus 
Tariq Ali 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
Date of hearing 
 
 
22-10-2024  
 
 
Appellant by: 
 
 
M/s Hamid Iftikhar Pannu 
and Saad Hayat Pannu, 
learned Advocates. 
 
 
Respondent by: 
 
 
Mr. Javed Ahmad Malik, 
learned Advocate. 
 
 
 
Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:– The present appeal 
is directed against order dated 10.05.2017, whereby, the 
learned trial Court has rejected an application seeking 
to set-aside ex-parte decree dated 04.05.2016 and at the 
same time leave application of the appellant has been 
dismissed. 
2.   
The relevant facts of the case are that           
the respondent filed suit dated 18.04.2013 (the „suit‟), 
under Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure- 
1908 (the „Code‟), for the recovery of Rs. 4,300,000/- 
on the basis of cheques No. 18848687, 18848694, 
18848693, 
18848690, 
18848691, 
18848692 
and 

        
      F.A.O. No. 68769-2017 
 
 
 
2 
18848689 (the „cheques‟).  
3.   
The appellant was proceeded against ex-parte 
vide order dated 21.06.2013. The ex-parte evidence was 
recorded and thereafter on 23.09.2014 judgment was 
passed in favour of the respondent for recovery of the 
amount involved in the cheques with costs and the 
prayer to grant mark-up was turned down.  
4.   
On 12.06.2015 the 
appellant filed an 
application seeking to set-aside the ex-parte judgment 
and to grant the leave, which was dismissed vide 
judgment dated 03.02.2016. Later it was revealed that 
no decree along with judgment dated 23.09.2014 was 
prepared upon which an application was instituted by 
the respondent and as a result thereof the learned trial 
Court proceeded to prepare ex-parte decree on 
04.05.2016. An appeal bearing No. 268-2016 instituted 
by the appellant against the judgment dated 03.02.2016  
was already before this Court. Upon realizing that the 
decree is prepared on 04.05.2016, the learned counsel 
for the appellant gave a statement before this Court that 
a fresh application to set-aside the decree dated 
04.05.2016 has been filed. His appeal was disposed of 
and in view of the submission of the learned counsel for 
the appellant, the learned trial Court was directed to 
decide the application afresh, in accordance with law. 
This second application dated 19.05.2016 as well as the 
leave accompanying the same was dismissed vide order 
dated 10.05.2017. Resultantly, the present appeal. 
5.   
Mr. Hamid Iftikhar Pannu, learned counsel for 
the appellant has relied upon various judgments and he 
has stated that the impugned order is result of 

        
      F.A.O. No. 68769-2017 
 
 
 
3 
application of incorrect law and as per mandate of 
Order XXXVII Rule 4 of the Code and Article 164 of 
the first schedule to the Limitation Act-1908 (the „Act‟) 
thirty days time period was available to the appellant 
for filing application to set-aside ex-parte decree dated 
04.05.2016. He has stated that the learned trial Court 
has wrongly reached to its conclusion that the appellant 
has failed to file the leave application within ten days 
which required rejection of leave application. 
6.   
Mr. Javed Ahmad Malik, learned counsel for 
the respondent has vehemently opposed this appeal and 
he has argued that the appellant in any case was obliged 
to file leave application within ten days after 
preparation of decree, whereas, the same is filed after 
fifteen days despite the fact that the appellant was 
already a participant in the proceedings before the 
learned trial Court as well as he instituted F.A.O. No. 
268 of 2016 and leave is, therefore, correctly rejected as 
per the law settled in case titled “Mansoor Ahmad 
versus Muhammad Iqbal” (1994 SCMR 560). He has 
further contended that only a short affidavit is attached 
with the leave application which is in defiance of Order 
XXXVII Rule 3(1) of the Code; that the said provision 
of law requires to disclose such facts as would make    
it incumbent on the holder of negotiable instrument     
to prove consideration or the other facts that it    
deemed sufficient to support the application,  upon 
affidavit. 
7.   
I have heard the arguments of the learned 
counsel for the parties and perused the record with their 
able assistance.

8.   
There is no dispute as to the settled 
proposition that thirty days time period is available to 
defender from the date of knowledge of ex-parte 
decree. This is when the defender has not participated 
in the proceedings and it is apparent from record that he 
never had knowledge of such proceedings. The learned 
counsel for the appellant is also correct in his argument 
that Order XXXVII Rule 4 of the Code specifically 
empowers the Court to set-aside the decree, when 
special circumstances are available. However, the 
present case has its peculiar facts and circumstances 
which perhaps can rarely arise. The judgment was 
passed on 23.09.2014. Both sides never pointed out that 
no decree was prepared. This remained the position 
until the respondent had problem in execution who then 
made an application dated 30.04.2016. Consequently, 
the learned Court prepared the decree on 04.05.2016. 
The appellant was aware of the judgment who instituted 
first application dated 12.06.2015 (hereinafter called as 
the „first application‟) which was contested on its 
merits but the first application failed. The appellant 
filed an appeal bearing No. 268 of 2016 wherein the 
following order was passed:- 
    “As per office report, the notice has been 
served upon the respondent but no one has 
entered appearance on behalf of the respondent 
today, therefore, the respondent is hereby 
proceeded against ex-parte. 
2.  Learned counsel for the appellant submits, 
that the decree sheet has been prepared in this 
case on 04.05.2016 and the appellant has already 
filed an application for setting aside the ex-parte 
decree before the concerned Court and if a 
direction is given to the learned Trial Court to 
decide the same strictly in accordance with law, 
the appellant will be satisfied. 
3. In view of the submission made by learned 

        
      F.A.O. No. 68769-2017 
 
 
 
5 
counsel 
for 
the 
appellant, 
the 
Trial 
Court/Additional District Judge is directed to 
decide the application of the appellant strictly in 
accordance with law. 
 
 
4. This appeal is disposed of accordingly.” 
 
9.   
Before passing of the above order, the 
appellant had already filed an application dated 
19.05.2016 
(hereinafter 
called 
as 
the 
„second 
application‟) to set-aside the ex-parte decree along with 
a leave application. In paragraph No. 3 of the second 
application the appellant has set-up the mode of 
knowledge of the judgment dated 23.09.2014 through 
one Samar, a clerk of Mr. Shahid Buttar-learned 
Advocate, alleging that the said learned Advocate was 
defending the criminal trial of the appellant. The period 
and grounds of knowledge are prior to the institution of 
the first application. I would like to reproduce 
paragraph No. 3 of the second application:- 
“3. On 04.02.2015, the respondent/plaintiff 
instituted petition for the execution of the 
decree though no decree had been drawn 
after the judgment dated 23.09.2014. The 
petitioner was not served in the execution 
petition as well and he was telephonically 
informed about the pendency of the Execution  
petition on 05.05.2015 by an Advocate's Clerk 
namely Samar who is working in Ferozewala 
courts. The counsel with whom Samar is 
working namely Shahid Buttar had remained 
petitioner's counsel in the criminal trial of the 
FIR registered by the respondent so the said 
clerk was aware of the particulars of the 
matter. The petitioner engaged Shahid Buttar 
Advocate for proceeding in the matter who 
submitted power of attorney (Vakalatnama) 
on his behalf before the Executing Court on 
08.05.2015 and the matter was adjourned for 
11.06.2015 for the appearance of the 
petitioner in person.”  
 
            (Underlining is added) 

        
      F.A.O. No. 68769-2017

10.   
The appellant had never set-up the above 
mode of knowledge in the first application. It appears 
that above specific development in mode of knowledge 
is due to the reason that vide judgment dated 
03.02.2016 (i.e. the judgment in the first application) 
the learned trial Court had already observed that the 
appellant has given the same address that is mentioned 
in the suit and he has admitted that his address in the 
suit is correct where he was served through ordinary 
mode, courier service and as per the observation of the 
then learned Judge, proof of the same was available. It 
is also evident from the record that the appellant in 
pursuance to the then pending execution, which was 
initiated on 07.02.2015 under the misconception that 
decree was also passed, appeared on 08.05.2015 and 
then kept on seeking adjournment without raising any 
objection. Facing this situation the appellant has 
modified his grounds as well as the mode of 
knowledge, in the second application.  
11.   
I am cognizant of the fact that no one should 
be prejudiced because of mistake of the Court, which 
has not prepared the decree for a long time period but 
this does not mean that litigant should be allowed to 
make developments in his case that too on the crucial 
points. I am not convinced that the appellant came to 
know about the case in the manners and on the date as 
pleaded in the second application. Otherwise, he would 
have taken the above reproduced plea in his first 
application.  
12.   
Much focus has been made in the second 
application as to the law that thirty days period is 
available to the appellant for seeking to set-aside the ex-

        
      F.A.O. No. 68769-2017 
 
 
 
7 
parte decree by referring to different cases but this 
second application lacks “special circumstances”, 
which are also essential to be shown for seeking to set-
aside the decree and for giving leave to the defender, if 
it seems reasonable to the Court to do so. In the absence 
of existence of “special circumstances” the defender of 
the suit of summary procedure is not entitled to the 
relief under Order XXXVII Rule 4 of the Code.  
13.   
For the reasons recorded above, I am not 
inclined to accept the present appeal and to grant leave 
or to set-aside the order assailed. This appeal fails. No 
order as to costs.
