house of Muhammad Jahangir on motorcycle near the 
Dera of Ihtasham co-accused, deceased Shafaqat Ali 
met them alongwith Ihtasham, petitioners Ghulam 
Mustafa, Saqlain and Sagar who were then armed with 
pistols and Shafaqat Ali told them that he was invited 
by his friends Ihtasham  etc. for dinner and being late, 
friends with him insisted for a sleep over and being so 
he was with them. When the witnesses departed and 
were at a distance of 1/1½ acre from the Dera of 
Ihtasham, they heard 4/5 fireshots but left the place 
with the understanding that Ihtashm and others are 
shooting fires to celebrate their compromise with the 
deceased. Muhammad Jahangir and Iqbal also got 
recorded their statements in line with supplementary 
statement of the complainant. During investigation, it 
has been found that petitioner Ihtasham facilitated by 
Faisal co-accused and in connivance with and in 
presence of the petitioners committed murder of 
Shafaqat Ali. Ghulam Mustafa alias Ali and Sagar 
petitioners threw dead body into the canal (راج
ہ با) while 
motorcycle of the deceased was thrown by Sagar, 
Saqlain and Ihtasham in nearby ‘Rohi Nala’.  The 
petitioners pointed out respective places of actual 
occurrence, disposal of the dead body and that of the 
motorcycle of the deceased. Sagar Ali got recovered 
motorcycle and the pistol used for the perpetration of 
the alleged offence. No reason for false implication of 
the petitioners by the complainant or the witnesses 
could be surfaced during the arguments. The 
investigation 
agency 
has 
found 
the 
petitioners 
connected with this planned murder while the offence 
alleged falls within the ambit of prohibitory clause of 

                   Crl. Misc. No.62426-B of 2023

section 497 Cr.P.C. Examination-in-chief of four of 
prosecution witnesses including the complainant stands 
recorded but they are not being cross-examined by the 
defence.  
4.  With regard to the case of Muhammad Saqlain 
petitioner, it has also been observed that he has again 
approached this Court for the relief of post arrest bail 
after withdrawing his earlier bail petition bearing Crl. 
Misc. No. 28112-B of 2023, after arguments on 
29.05.2023. Petition moved by him before the Hon’ble 
Apex Court as per order dated 06.09.2023 was also 
dismissed having not been pressed that too after 
arguments. Then petitioner approached the learned 
Court of first instance through second bail application 
which was dismissed by the learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Lahore on 21.09.2023 for the reason 
that petitioner was not having any fresh ground. Now 
he for the second time has come up to this Court on the 
ground that his earlier bail petition was not dismissed 
by this Court as according to the subject order it was 
“disposed of”. Learned counsel for the petitioner has 
argued that word disposed of does not denote dismissal 
of the petition being so disposal of an application etc is 
not to be equated with dismissal. 
5.    Perusal of the subject order reveals that the then 
learned Counsel for the petitioner after arguments 
expressed his wish to withdraw that petition, 
whereupon, petition was “disposed of accordingly”. 
         As per BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY TENTH 
EDITION, “disposal” means a patent application’s 
termination by withdrawal, rejection, or grant. In some 

                   Crl. Misc. No.62426-B of 2023 
                   Crl. Misc. No.66107-B of 2023

countries, the meaning is limited to “rejection”. It 
further explains as under; 
 
“2. A final settlement or determination < the 
court’s disposition of the case> while explaining the 
“informal disposition”. The termination of a case by 
means other than trial; any action that leads to 
disposition without conviction and without a judicial 
determination of guilt, such as guilty pleas and 
decisions not to prosecute while “disposition without a 
trial” is explained; ‘the final determination of a criminal 
case without a trial on the merits, as when a defendant 
pleads guilty or admits sufficient facts to support a 
guilty finding without a trial.  
 
The “OXFORD PAPERBACK THESAURUS, INDIAN 
EDITION” at page 239 shows informal meaning of dispose of as 
“get shut of”.

  Per 
the 
FIFTH 
EDITIION, 
The 
AMERICAN 
HERITAGE DISCTIONAY of the English Language.  
 
“The word dispose also means; To determine the 
course of events: and dispose of means; To                    
finish dealing with something; settle”:  
 
 
 
 
  
   While discussing the word disposal in case titled 
“K.R.K Talwar v. Union of India, (Dehli)(DB) reported 
as 1977 AIR (Delhi) 189: 1977 (13) DLT 310: 1977(I) 
ILR (Delhi) 138”, Dehli High Court observed as under; 
 
“The words ‘dispose of’ merely mean put an 
end to the appeal by any of the recognized 

                   Crl. Misc. No.62426-B of 2023 
                   Crl. Misc. No.66107-B of 2023

methods. We are all aware of the word ‘disposal’ 
of judicial cases. In fact, every month, statements 
of disposals are made in respect of each court. 
These disposals include disposal of all kinds, 
namely disposals for default, by compromise, etc., 
that is, not on merits as also disposal on merits. It 
is well established that when legislature uses a 
word which has a well understood meaning in the 
particular contest in which the word is used, then 
it is presumed to have used the word with the 
same meaning. The word ‘disposal’ in relation to 
judicial cases and appeals has always included all 
kinds of disposals.” (Underlining for emphasis 
only)   
 
 
This observation has been given by Dehli 
High Court while discussing sub-section (4) of 
Section 9 of the Public Premises (Eviction of 
Unauthorised 
Occupants) 
Act, 
1958 
(then 
corresponding to Section 9 (4) of the Public 
Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) 
Act, 1971 which reads as under: 
“Every appeal under this section shall be 
disposed of by the appellate officer as 
expeditiously as possible.” 
  
6.     Having benefit from the information mentioned 
supra, in view of this Court, by disposing of some 
matter may not mean decision on merit yet the 
expression of desire to withdraw the petition after 
arguments and the order disposed of accordingly, 
does mean that the matter was contested but as the 
petitioner agrees to withdraw his bail petition instead of 
getting it dismissed on merit, he preferred to get it 
ended without any formal, detailed and reasoned order 
or formal decision of the Court. So, in other words, the 
order “learned counsel for the petitioner wishes to 
withdraw this petition after arguments.  Disposed of 
accordingly” means that subject petition terminated, 

                   Crl. Misc. No.62426-B of 2023

settled, ended, concluded or closed as desired by the 
learned counsel for the petitioner after arguments and 
consideration of the merits of the case. The petitioner 
even today is not equipped with any fresh ground to 
justify the institution of the petition in hand bearing Crl. 
Misc.  No. 62426-B of 2023 that being so is not even 
maintainable.  
7.  
 In this view of the matter, I am not inclined to 
grant relief of post arrest bail to the petitioners. Hence, 
bail applications moved by Sagar bearing Crl. Misc. 
No.62439-B of 2023, Ghulam Mustafa alias Ali bearing 
Crl. Misc. No.66107-B of 2023 and Muhammad Saqlain 
bearing Crl. Misc. No.62426-B of 2023 respectively are 
dismissed.
