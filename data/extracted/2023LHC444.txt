Petitioner in W.P. 
No.1554/2017: 
Ch. Muhammad Aslam Ghuman, 
Advocate. 
           Anwaar Hussain, J.  Through this single judgment, the present 
as well as connected constitutional petitions bearing W.P Nos. 1365 & 
1554 of 2017, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as “the Constitution”) 
are simultaneously being decided as the same involve identical questions 
of law and facts and have assailed the same judgment passed by the 
learned Revisional Court below.  
2. 
 The petitioners in the present petition (hereinafter referred to as the 
“petitioners/minors”) have filed the same through next friend, namely, 
Yasmin Akhtar who is admittedly their real maternal aunt. Challenge has 
been laid to judgment dated 06.04.2017 (hereinafter referred to as “the 
impugned judgment”) whereby the revision petition filed by respondent 
No.3, namely, Yasir Akhtar Abbasi (hereinafter referred to as “the 
respondent/plaintiff”) against order dated 08.10.2012 of the learned Trial 
Court was accepted. By virtue of order dated 08.10.2012, the learned Trial 
Court accepted the application filed by one Mst. Mubashara Sultan 
(hereinafter referred to as “the respondent/mother”), on her own behalf 

 
 
2 
W.P. No.1222 of 2017 
 
 
 
 
and on behalf of the petitioners/minors, for setting aside ex-parte 
judgment and decree dated 13.09.2008  (hereinafter referred to as “ex-
parte judgement and decree”), passed in the suit for specific 
performance of contract instituted by the respondent/plaintiff, on the basis 
of an agreement to sell dated 13.01.2004 purportedly entered into with 
one Naeem Akhtar Kiani, who happened to be real father of the 
petitioners/minors and husband of  the respondent/mother and the ex-parte 
judgment and decree in favour of the respondent/plaintiff was set aside. 
The respondent/mother has independently filed connected constitutional 
petition bearing W.P No.1365 of 2017 against the impugned judgment. 
Whereas M/s Mumtaz City (hereinafter referred to as “M/s Mumtaz 
City”) has filed W.P No. 1554 of 2017 as its application filed under Order 
I, Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 
“the CPC”) before the learned Revisional Court below was also 
dismissed through the impugned judgment.  
 
3. 
By 
way 
of 
factual 
background, 
it 
is 
noted 
that 
the 
respondent/plaintiff instituted the suit against the petitioners/minors as 
well as the respondent/mother with the averments that property measuring 
18-Kanal, 10-Marla originally owned by late Naeem Akhtar Kiani was 
sold to the respondent/plaintiff, through agreement dated 13.01.2004 @ 
Rs.150,000/- per kanal and total sale price amounting to Rs.2,775,000/- 
was paid on the spot and possession of the suit property was delivered to 
the respondent/plaintiff, however, the sale deed could not be executed. 
Said Naeem Akhtar Kiani admittedly died on 30.03.2004 where after 
statedly a request was made to the respondent/mother, in her capacity as 
legal heir of late Naeem Akhtar Kiani, to complete the transaction on her 
own behalf and on behalf of the petitioners/minors by way of recording 
and sanctioning of a mutation or through execution of a registered sale 
deed and when the needful was not done, the suit was instituted on 
08.02.2005. The petitioners/minors were sued through the respondent/ 
mother with the assertion that there is no adverse interest of the 
respondent/mother, against the petitioners/minors. The respondent/mother 
appeared on 28.04.2006 after publication of notice in newspaper regarding 

 
 
3 
W.P. No.1222 of 2017 
 
 
 
 
the pendency of the suit and power of attorney was submitted on her 
behalf as well as on behalf of the petitioners/minors and the matter 
remained pending  for  filing of written statement when on 14.12.2006 ex-
parte proceedings (hereinafter referred to as “ex-parte proceedings”) 
were initiated and thereafter, evidence of the respondent/plaintiff was 
recorded who appeared himself along with one of the marginal witnesses 
of the agreement and as a consequence thereof, ex-parte judgment and 
decree was passed. On 01.11.2011, an application for setting aside ex-
parte judgment and decree was filed by the respondent/mother with the 
averments that her daughter got unwell and she could not vigilantly 
pursue the matter. The said application was vehemently contested by the 
respondent/plaintiff on the ground that the same is badly time barred, both 
in terms of Article 163 of the Limitation Act, 1908 (hereinafter referred to 
as “the Act 1908”) and/or Article 181 thereof, as the said application for 
setting aside ex-parte judgment and decree has been filed after lapse of 
three years. The learned Trial Court accepted the application of 
respondent/mother vide order dated 08.10.2012 and the ex-parte judgment 
and decree in favour of the respondent/plaintiff was set aside against 
which the civil revision was filed by the respondent/plaintiff that was 
accepted, vide the impugned judgment and accordingly, order of the 
learned Trial Court dated 08.10.2012 was set aside. During the pendency 
of revision petition filed by the respondent/plaintiff, application under 
Order I Rule 10 of the CPC was filed by M/s Mumtaz City with the 
averments that the respondent/mother has lawfully transferred the 
property in its favour through a mutation after having been appointed as 
guardian of person and property of the petitioners/minors. While passing 
the impugned judgment, the application filed by M/s Mumtaz City has 
been dismissed as well. In constitutional petition bearing W.P. No.1365 of 
2017 filed by the respondent/mother, the petitioners/minors have been 
arrayed as proforma respondents, through their next friend.  
4. 
On behalf of the petitioners/minors, Mr. Muhammad Munir 
Paracha, Advocate assisted by Mr. Zeeshan Munir Paracha, Advocate, 
submits that not only Order XXXII Rule 3 of the CPC was violated but 
also other provisions meant for safeguarding the interests of the minors 

 
 
4 
W.P. No.1222 of 2017 
 
 
 
 
have been ignored. Contends that a minor cannot be proceeded ex-parte in 
a case. Further submits that the order initiating ex-parte proceedings and 
the ex-parte judgment and decree passed thereafter was rightly set aside 
by the learned Trial Court through order dated 08.10.2012, therefore, the 
civil revision filed by the respondent/plaintiff should not have been 
accepted inasmuch as exercise of the revisional jurisdiction is 
discretionary in nature and when substantial justice had been done by the 
learned Trial Court to safeguard the rights of the petitioners/minors, 
restraint should have been shown by the learned Revisional Court below. 
Places reliance on case titled “Manager, Jammu & Kashmir, State 
Property in Pakistan v. Khuda Yar and another” (PLD 1975 SC 678) in 
support of his contention. Learned counsel for the respondent/mother as 
well as M/s Mumtaz City, while adopting the arguments of learned 
counsel for the petitioners/minors add that M/s Mumtaz City is a bona fide 
purchaser for value and it dealt with the respondent/mother only after the 
latter had duly been appointed as guardian of person and property of the 
petitioners/minors.  
5. 
Conversely, 
Mr. 
Mujeeb-ur-Rehman 
Kayani, 
Advocate 
representing the respondent/plaintiff submits that the respondent/mother 
as well as the petitioners/minors through their purported next friend 
namely, Yasmin Akhtar are depriving the respondent/plaintiff from the 
fruits of a lawful decree passed in favour of the latter inasmuch as the 
respondent/mother contested the suit by appearing in the same on her own 
and on behalf of the petitioners/minors and when the ex-parte judgment 
and decree was passed, the application was filed by the respondent/mother 
beyond limitation period and the reason put forth was the illness of the 
daughter of the respondent/mother without any supporting evidence, and 
therefore, the learned Trial Court erred in allowing the said application 
against which the civil revision of the respondent/plaintiff was rightly 
accepted by the learned Revisional Court below through the impugned 
judgment and since, in the interregnum, through the order of the Court of 
competent jurisdiction, the respondent/mother was appointed as guardian 
of property of the petitioners/minors and in her capacity as guardian of 
property of the petitioners/minors, admittedly the respondent/mother 

 
 
5 
W.P. No.1222 of 2017 
 
 
 
 
alienated the property in favour of M/s Mumtaz City, the same prima 
facie shows the malafide intention on part of the petitioners/minors as 
well as the respondent/mother and the formers have now moved this Court 
through a purported next friend and they all are trying to hoodwink the 
respondent/plaintiff by abusing the process of law. Further contends that 
malafide is further evident when connected Writ Petition No.1365 of 2017 
is perused inasmuch as the impugned judgment has been independently 
assailed by the respondent/mother and hence, the present petition filed by 
the petitioners/minors by next friend is not maintainable. Concludes that 
the purpose of revisional jurisdiction is supervisory in nature which is 
meant for correction of error apparent on the face of record and not to aid 
a litigant who is acting with malice.   
6. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioners/minors submits that 
the arguments on behalf of the respondent/plaintiff are misconceived 
inasmuch as it is for this Court to examine whether the present 
constitutional petition has been competently filed by the next friend or 
not, keeping in view the intention of the legislature contemplated in terms 
of Order XXXII, Rule 11 of the CPC whereunder it is well envisaged that 
a minor‟s interest is to be kept at the forefront in cases involving the 
person or property of the minor. 
7. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
8. 
The pivotal questions of law requiring determination by this Court 
are as under: 
i. 
Whether the non-representation of minor in suit and/or 
non-compliance of the statutory provisions regarding 
appointment of Guardian ad Litem thereof is just a 
procedural irregularity without causing any prejudice 
to the petitioners/minors? 
 
ii. 
Whether non-compliance with the provisions of Order 
XXXII, Rule 3 of the CPC and concomitant non-
representation of the petitioners/minors render the ex-
parte 
judgment 
voidable 
at 
the 
option 
of 
petitioners/minors or is void and nullity in the eye of 
law?  
 

 
 
6 
W.P. No.1222 of 2017 
 
 
 
 
iii. 
What is the effect of admitted appointment of the 
respondent/mother as guardian during the pendency of 
the proceedings, which appointment is still intact?  
9. 
Before embarking upon the discussion and analysis of the above 
formulated questions of law, it would be convenient to reproduce Order 
XXXII of the CPC as the answer to the said questions primarily lies in 
examining the true import of Order XXXII in general and Rule 3 read 
with Rule 11 thereof in particular. Order XXXII of the CPC reads as 
under: 
“ORDER XXXII  
SUITS BY OR AGAINST MINORS AND PERSONS 
OF UNSOUND MIND  
1. Minor to sue by next friend.--Every suit by a minor shall 
be instituted in his name by a person who in such suit shall 
be called the next friend of the minor.  
2. ………...  
3. Guardian for the suit to be appointed by Court for minor 
defendant.--(1) Where the defendant is a minor, the Court, 
on being satisfied of the fact of his minority, shall appoint 
a proper person to be guardian for the suit for such minor.  
(2) An order for the appointment of guardian for the 
suit may be obtained upon application in the name and on 
behalf of the minor or by the plaintiff.  
(3) Such application shall be supported by an affidavit 
verifying the fact that the proposed guardian has no interest 
in the matters in controversy in the suit adverse to that of 
the minor and that he is a fit person to be so appointed.  
(4) No order shall be made on any application under 
this rule except upon notice to minor and to any guardian 
of the minor appointed or declared by an authority 
competent in that behalf, or, where there is no such 
guardian, upon notice to the father or other natural 
guardian of the minor, or, where there is no father or other 
natural guardian, to the person in whose care the minor is, 
and after hearing any objection which may be urged on 
behalf of any person served with notice under this sub-rule.  
(5) A person appointed under sub-rule (1) to be 
guardian for the suit for a minor shall, unless his 
appointment is terminated by retirement, removal or death, 
continue as such throughout all proceedings arising out of 
the suit including proceedings in any appellate or 
revisional Court and any proceedings in the execution of a 
decree.

4. …..

……. 
11.  Retirement, removal or death of guardian for the suit.-
(1) Where the guardian for the suit desires to retire or 
does not do his duty, or where other sufficient ground is 
made to appear, the Court may permit such guardian to 
retire or may remove him, and may make such order as to 
costs as it thinks fit.  
(2) Where the guardian for the suit retires, dies or is 
removed by the Court during the pendency of the suit, the 
Court shall appoint a new guardian in his place.  
12. ….” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Careful perusal of Order XXXII of the CPC indicates that a minor neither 
can sue by himself nor can he be sued without being represented by 
someone else. The „someone else‟ is considered as „a next friend‟ when a 
minor brings an action as a plaintiff/petitioner, whereas, it is referred as „a 
Guardian ad Litem‟ when the minor is a defendant/respondent. In fact, 
this nomenclature does not matter much and the intent of the legislature is 
well evident inasmuch as both the next friend or the Guardian ad Litem 
represent the interest of the minor and/or are under an obligation to remain 
watchful and in case the Guardian ad Litem is not performing his duties, 
the Court is under a bounden duty to remove the Guardian ad Litem and 
appoint a new guardian instead.   
10.  
How the minors are to be sued and the proceedings are to be 
conducted in a case has been under judicial scrutiny by the Superior 
Courts in Pakistan and by scanning various judicial pronouncements, 
following legal principles can be succinctly deduced therefrom, which are 
the binding guidelines that a learned Trial Court must adhered to:                                       
            
i) 
Once a minor is sued as a defendant, the plaintiff must file an 
application proposing the names of the close relatives to be 
appointed as Guardian ad Litem and if the plaintiff fails to give 
such names even the plaint can be rejected. Case titled “Ghulam 
Muhammad and another v. Muhammad Feroze and 2 others” 
(PLD 1983 Lahore 164) is referred in this regard. 

 
 
8 
W.P. No.1222 of 2017 
 
 
 
 
ii) 
If Guardian ad Litem is not appointed before passing of the 
decree, such a decree is nullity in the eye of law. Cases titled 
“Yar Muhammad v. Amnat and others” (1988 CLC 1355) and 
“Mst. Rooh Afza v. Sher Aman Khan & others” (PLD 1993 
Peshawar 49) are referred in this regard. 
iii) 
The provisions of Order XXXII, Rule 3 of the CPC, regarding 
the representation of the minor litigants, should normally be 
applied strictly, however, any failure to comply with the same is 
a curable irregularity provided no prejudice has been caused to 
the minor, and his interests were duly represented by the 
irregularly appointed Guardian ad Litem or by some other 
defendants who had identical interest with the minor in the 
matters in controversy in the suit. But if it is found that the 
minor has been prejudiced, then it is deemed that such minor 
was not duly represented in the proceedings, and accordingly he 
cannot be regarded as a party to the said proceedings, with the 
result that any order or decree therein would not be binding on 
him and such a decree or order would be a nullity in the eye of 
law. Case reported as “Mashal Khan v. Fazal Karim and 
another” [PLD 1963 (W.P.) Pesh 93] is referred. 
iv) 
Without any formal appointment of Guardian ad Litem, the 
proceedings conducted in a suit are nullity in the eye of law. 
Case reported as “Trustees of the Port Karachi (KPT) v. Mst. 
Naheed and 3 others” (2013 MLD 1200) is referred in this 
regard.  
v) 
Courts being custodian of interest of the minors are required to 
be watchful when a mother fails to appear and defend the 
interest of the minors. Case titled “Mst. Fauzia  Parveen alias 
Fauzia Tiwana v. Mst. Sahib Khatoon and others” (1988 SCMR 
552) is referred in this regard.  
vi) 
The minors are vulnerable citizens and the Courts had inherent 
power, being parens patriae, to protect the interest of the 
minors, who require proper protection of the Court in terms       
of  Principles  of  Policies  enshrined  in  the Constitution, which  

 
 
9 
W.P. No.1222 of 2017 
 
 
 
 
 
envisage special protection to women, children as well as the 
marginalized citizens as per Article 35 thereof. Case reported as 
“Muhammad Amjad Khan Afridi and others v. Shad Muhammad 
and others (PLD 2022 SC 27) is referred in this regard. 
vii) 
Order XXXII of the CPC visualizes no such occasion where a 
minor defendant can be proceeded against ex- parte. Case of 
Muhammad Amjad Khan Afridi supra is referred. 
11. 
The above-mentioned principles, viz. interpretation and scope of 
Order XXXII of the CPC, culled down by the Courts in general and the 
Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in particular, clearly propel to the 
conclusion that the appointment of Guardian ad Litem in terms of Order 
XXXII, Rule 3 of the CPC is to protect the interest of minor. However, 
any irregularity in the appointment of the Guardian ad Litem may be 
overlooked as a procedural irregularity but this is subject to an overriding 
condition that such irregularity ought not to have prejudiced the minor and 
that his right to due representation in the proceedings must not have 
suffered any injury. Thus, it is obligatory upon the Court to overlook the 
procedural irregularity in the appointment of Guardian ad Litem where 
the minor has been duly represented by irregularly appointed Guardian ad 
Litem. However, where the minor is deprived of due representation, such 
irregularity transforms into and takes up the proportion of substantial 
deprivation of due process to the minor and cannot be allowed to sustain 
the subsequent decree or order which is void and nullity in the eye of law. 
Similarly, in cases where there is no duly appointed guardian and/or minor 
remained without proper representation, the decree, ipso facto, is nullity in 
the eye of law and void and the minor is not even required to get it set 
aside. The crux of the discussion is that even if the plaintiff of a suit is not 
coming forth with a fair approach by seeking an appointment of Guardian 
ad Litem for the minors/defendants against whom he has instituted a suit, 
or if a guardian is appointed and neglects to perform his/her duty towards 
the interest of the minors, the Courts are always under an obligation to 
remain  vigilant  and  watchful  to protect the interest of such minor and in  

 
 
10 
W.P. No.1222 of 2017 
 
 
 
 
 
the first place ensure that a person from the near relatives (preferably 
father and mother) are appointed as the Guardian ad Litem to defend the 
interest of the minor and in the absence of the same or the neglect of such 
Guardian ad Litem once appointed to pursue the matter vigilantly, should 
appoint its own staff to act in the said capacity and, in no eventuality, the 
minor can be proceeded ex-parte. Therefore, if a minor is not effectively 
represented in a suit or in any proceedings, such a defect is not one of 
mere form, but of substance, and it goes to the root of the jurisdiction of 
the Court, hence, such a minor in the eye of law is not a party to such a 
suit or proceedings. As a natural corollary, no order or decree can be 
validly passed against a minor in such a suit, and any ex-parte proceedings 
conducted against him will not bind him or his estate at all.  
12.      In the instant case, admittedly the respondent/plaintiff instituted the 
suit and arrayed the petitioners/minors as defendants No. 1(B) and 1(C) 
and sued them through the respondent/mother who was arrayed as 
defendant No.1(A) and when the respondent/mother appeared and power 
of attorney was submitted on her own behalf, no order was passed by the 
learned Trial Court appointing the respondent/mother as Guardian ad 
Litem. Repeated adjournments were sought by the respondent/mother to 
submit written statement and the same were allowed by the learned Trial 
Court before passing of order dated 14.12.2006 whereby the ex-parte 
proceedings were initiated. In this manner, the learned Trial Court erred in 
law by abdicating its duty imposed on it under Rules 3 and 11 of Order 
XXXII of the CPC which clearly contemplate that if a guardian does not 
do his duty, the Court may remove such guardian. In the instant case, in 
the first place there was neither any application on part of the 
respondent/plaintiff to appoint the respondent/mother as Guardian ad 
Litem nor the learned Trial Court appointed her to be so and even if it is 
assumed that the respondent/mother had an implicit approval of the 
learned Trial Court to act as Guardian ad Litem, for the reason that she 
had no adverse interest against the petitioners/minors, though               
such approval is not permissible under the law, still when she neglected to  

 
 
11 
W.P. No.1222 of 2017 
 
 
 
 
 
pursue the matter, the petitioners/minors should not have been proceeded 
ex-parte at all and some other person should have been appointed as 
Guardian ad Litem since the Courts, in such eventualities, must be 
mindful of their duty envisaged under Rule 11 of Order XXXII of the 
CPC, which in the instant case is conspicuous by its absence. Order 
XXXII, Rule 3 read with Rule 11 of the CPC is mandatory and 
imperative, and must be strictly complied with in cases where defendant is 
a minor. Failure on part of the learned Court to follow these mandatory 
provisions leads to the consequence that there is no proper party to the 
suit, in the eye of law, though his name appears on the record, therefore, 
such minor must be deemed in law to be wholly unrepresented, and 
consequently the jurisdiction of the Court to proceed against such a minor 
will be ousted and the Court will have no jurisdiction to render any 
judgment, or pass any order against a minor. In the present case, the 
respondent/mother could have been motivated with ulterior designs or 
negligent and proceeded ex-parte, however, her acts or omissions, 
whether with or without any mala fide cannot be made basis for initiation 
of adverse proceedings against the petitioners/minors. The ex-parte 
judgment and decree passed against the petitioners/minors was without 
appointment of Guardian ad Litem. The same might have become a 
curable irregularity had the petitioners/minors been properly and duly 
represented by the respondent/mother after she appeared. However, when 
she subsequently elected not to appear, the learned Trial Court was 
obligated not to proceed without appointment of a Guardian ad Litem. 
Hence, on this ground alone, the ex-parte proceedings followed by the ex-
parte judgment and decree are nullity in the eye of law and any 
superstructure built thereon also falls, and the learned Revisional Court 
has erred in examining the matter from a different angle in which ordinary 
applications for setting-aside ex-parte decree are to be dealt with.                                                    
13. 
While arguing the case, a great deal of emphasis has been laid by 
learned counsel for the respondent/plaintiff that the respondent/mother is 
still  validly  appointed  guardian  of  the  petitioners/minors  and  filing of  

 
 
12 
W.P. No.1222 of 2017 
 
 
 
 
the petition by the petitioners/minors through another next friend instead 
of the guardian appointed by the Court is not maintainable. The argument 
does not hold water and is misconceived, to say the least, on two counts. 
Firstly, the guardian appointed under the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 
(hereinafter referred to as „the Act 1890‟) and the appointment of 
Guardian ad Litem stand on two different pedestals. The term Guardian 
ad Litem implies guardian for the litigation (suit) appointed in accordance 
with law by the Court in which a suit is instituted against the minors and 
may be removed by the same Court in terms of Rule 11 of Order XXXII 
of the CPC and is confined to the same as compared to guardian appointed 
by the Guardian Court under the Act, 1890. Secondly, no Guardian ad 
Litem was appointed by the learned Trial Court and the decree against the 
petitioners/minors was passed without affording due representation to 
them. The learned Trial Court was obligated, at least, on non-appearance 
of the respondent/mother to appoint some other Guardian ad Litem to 
grant representation to the petitioners/minors for protection of their rights. 
Here, it is imperative to note that this Court is cognizant of the fact that an 
appeal or further proceedings by some Guardian ad Litem other than the 
one appointed by the learned Trial Court seem not to be envisaged unless 
such Guardian ad Litem is removed in terms of Rule 11 of Order XXXII 
of the CPC. In case reported as “Raj Behari Lal and others. v. Dr. 
Mahabir Prasad and others” (AIR 1956 Allahabad 310), the larger 
bench of the Allahabad High Court held as under: 
“48. Our answer to the question referred to us, therefore, is 
that a minor defendant against whom a decree is passed 
cannot validly institute an appeal through a person other 
than the guardian 'ad litem' appointed by the trial Court, who 
has not resigned or died or been removed, provided that the 
appellate Court may, on sufficient cause being shown, allow 
an appeal to be filed on behalf of the minor by a person 
other than the guardian ad litem appointed by the trial Court 
by removing such guardian and appointing such other 
person as the guardian of the minor from the date of the 
institution of the appeal.” 
Where the learned Trial Court appoints a particular person as Guardian ad 
Litem, someone else may not prefer an appeal unless any of the 
contingency envisaged under Order XXXII, Rule 11 of the CPC occurs or 

 
 
13 
W.P. No.1222 of 2017 
 
 
 
 
the said Guardian ad Litem is removed by the Court, however, the facts in 
the instant case are relatively different as no Guardian ad Litem was 
appointed by the learned Trial Court in the suit for specific performance 
instituted by the respondent/plaintiff wherein the ex-parte judgment and 
decree sought to be set aside was passed, rather the respondent/mother 
appeared and then subsequently chose not to appear leaving the 
petitioners/minors unrepresented. No Guardian ad Litem was appointed 
by the learned Trial Court, which as stated earlier, renders the decree 
nullity and void in the eye of law. Thus, no Guardian ad Litem of the 
petitioners/minors was in existence at the time of filing of the present 
constitutional petition barring their aunt as next friend from filing the 
same. As regards the respondent/mother having been appointed guardian 
by the Competent Court, the proceedings for the same are neither before 
this Court nor the same are under challenge in the instant proceedings. 
Whereas failure of the respondent/mother in protecting the rights of the 
petitioners/minors is well evident from the record as far as the 
proceedings 
that 
took 
place 
in 
the 
suit 
instituted 
by 
the 
respondent/plaintiff. Therefore, the argument subsides to irrelevancy from 
another perspective discussed earlier that the decree itself to the extent of 
the petitioners/minors is not merely voidable calling upon the 
petitioners/minors to get it set aside rather the same is void and nullity in 
the eye of law.

It has been also vehemently argued by learned counsel for the 
respondent/plaintiff that the respondent/mother has been appointed as the 
guardian by the Competent Court, therefore, consequences of her absence 
are to be faced by the petitioners/minors, however, the said appointment 
too cannot be so construed as to have ratified the inherent irregularity 
rather illegality in the ex-parte judgment and decree passed against the 
petitioners/minors without their representation. In the light of law laid 
down in case of Muhammad Amjad Khan Afridi supra this Court has 
inherent powers, more particularly, while exercising its constitutional 
jurisdiction to protect the interest of the petitioners/minors who, when 
sued by the respondent/plaintiff for specific performance of purported

agreement to sell executed by their predecessor-in-interest, were minors. 
There was a grave omission on part of the learned Trial Court by initially 
not appointing a Guardian ad Litem and treating the respondent/mother as 
a duly appointed guardian and later on proceeding ex-parte against the 
petitioners/minors when the former failed to appear. While considering 
this material fact that the petitioners/minors were not of the age of the 
majority at the time of the institution of the suit, the application for setting 
aside the ex-parte judgment and decree on their behalf should have been 
allowed and the learned Revisional Court below has erred in law by not 
appreciating this aspect. Even otherwise, had the petitioners/minors not 
even moved the Court for setting aside the ex-parte judgment and decree, 
the same was void and nullity in the eye of law as held in case of Mashal 
Khan supra. Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that present 
constitutional petition on behalf of the petitioners/minors has been validly 
filed by the next friend.

Adverting to the constitutional petition bearing W.P No.1365/2017 
filed by the respondent/mother, it is, undisputedly, matter of record that 
she entered appearance in the suit and subsequently disappeared on her 
own behalf and as guardian of the petitioners/minors, a duty she herself 
assumed whereafter she willfully absented herself and failed to defend the 
suit on her own behalf. Moreover, she had filed a petition and got herself 
appointed as guardian and subsequently sold the suit property to M/s 
Mumtaz City, which fact is also somewhat reflective of the disregard she 
paid to the proceedings where she had entered appearance and pendency 
thereof against her. On the other hand, she averred that she could not 
appear on account of her daughter being not well which is not supported 
by any evidence. It does not appeal to logic that she was hampered to 
appear in the suit and was in a position to get herself appointed as 
guardian and subsequently sell the suit property to M/s Mumtaz City 
despite being in knowledge of the pendency of the suit against her but 
could not defend the said suit. Therefore, this Court does not concur with 
the cause of non-appearance by the respondent/mother and to her extent, 
the impugned judgment does not suffer from any illegality.

In the light of above mentioned discussion, this Court is of the opinion that 
the present petition filed by the petitioners/minors through their next friend merits 
acceptance and the same is allowed and the ex-parte proceedings as well as the 
ex-parte judgment and decree in favour of the respondent/plaintiff are set aside to 
the extent of the petitioners/minors only, whereas, connected petition bearing 
W.P. No.1365/2017 filed by the respondent/mother who was admittedly a 
defendant and an independent stakeholder in the suit property, as widow of late 
Naeem Akthar Kiani, could not offer any plausible reason to disappear, while 
watching her own interest and was extremely negligent in pursuing the interest of 
the petitioners/minors and to her extent, the said petition is dismissed and the ex-
parte proceedings as well as the ex-parte judgment and decree remain intact. 
Insofar as connected petition bearing W.P. No.1554/2017 filed by M/s Mumtaz 
City is concerned, the said petition is disposed of having become infructuous on 
the ground that the ex-parte proceedings as well as the ex-parte judgment and 
decree in favour of the respondent/plaintiff have been set aside to extent of the 
petitioners/minors and matter needs to be examined by the learned Trial Court 
afresh, in suit for specific performance of contract instituted by the 
respondent/plaintiff, therefore, M/s Mumtaz City is always at liberty to approach 
the learned Trial Court for pursuing its interest in the suit property by filing an 
appropriate application, which, if filed, shall be dealt with on its own merits. The 
learned Trial Court shall proceed with the suit instituted by the 
respondent/plaintiff against the petitioners/minors from the stage where it was on 
14.12.2006 when the order of proceeding ex-parte was passed against them and 
shall decide the same expeditiously, preferably within a period of 06-months 
commencing from the date of receipt of certified copy of this judgment.
