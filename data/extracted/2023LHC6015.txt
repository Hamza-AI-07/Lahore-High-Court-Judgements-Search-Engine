Pharmaceuticals (the “Company”), in connection whereto, this Court 
will seek guidance from the Preamble as well as Sections 6, 276 and 
277 of the Companies Act, 2017 (the “Act”). For meaningful and 
object-oriented conclusion, this Court will also discuss the legal 
doorways for the purpose of resolution of corporate disputes through 
intervention of the Court as to how a company petition filed under 
Part IX Section 286 and 287 of the “Act” can be converted into 
proceedings under Section 276 and 277 envisaged in Part III of the 
“Act” dealing with mediation, arbitration, arrangements and 
reconstruction.  
2. 
The Petitioners have filed this petition under Sections 286 and 
287 alongwith all enabling provisions of the “Act” alleging the 
mismanagement by Respondents No.1 to 3 (Siraj-ud-Din, Hazrat 
Ullah and Abu Zar Faizy Rattu) in the affairs of the Respondent No.4/ 
the “Company”, with the following prayer: 
“In light of the submissions made above, and, also 
given the circumstances that the company cannot 
remain a growing/ running concern because of the 
obstinate behavior of Group-B, it is most humbly 
prayed that the instant petition be accepted and 
direction be passed by this Honorable Court for: 
(a) 
Purchase of shares held by the 
Respondents No.1, 2 and 3 by the 
Petitioners or purchase of shares held by 
the Petitioners by the Respondents at 
offered price; rate being same for both in 
either instance and under the same terms 
and conditions. 
(b) 
Setting aside of agreement under 
the consent decree and the reconstitution 
of board on the basis of fresh elections 
according to the Companies Act, 2017 
under the direct supervision of either the 
Honorable Court or SECP. 
(c) 
The operations of the Company 
may be run by the Petitioners. 
Any other relief deemed just and appropriate may 
also be granted in favour of the Petitioners.”

I. 
CONTEXT 
3. 
Factual history of the case is that the Respondents No.1 and 2 
(Siraj-ud-Din and Hazrat Ullah) filed two Civil Originals. First Civil 
Original No.03 of 2021 was filed on 05.10.2021 under Section 126 of 
the “Act” for rectification of the registers of the “Company” while 
second Civil Original No.04 of 2021 under Sections 286 and 287 and 
other enabling provisions of the “Act” was filed for appropriate 
orders with regard to the affairs of the “Company”. Eventually, 
proceedings were carried out by the Court in Civil Original No.04 of 
2021 and in terms of order dated 27.01.2022, the counsel for the 
parties were directed to arrange meeting of the parties and other 
concerned for the resolution of issue amicably and for protection of 
interest of the “Company”, by adopting the process of Early  
Neutral-Party Evaluation (the “ENE”) and the parameters settled by 
this Court in “SAUDI PAK INDUSTRIAL & AGRICULTURAL 
INVESTMENT COMPANY LTD versus CHENAB LIMITED” (2020 
CLD 339) and “THE ADDITIONAL REGISTRAR COMPANY versus 
AL-QAIM SUGAR MILLS LTD.” (2021 CLD 931). On the next date 
of hearing i.e. 31.01.2022, following order was passed: 
 
“Pursuant to the order dated 27.01.2022, learned 
counsel for the Petitioner has placed on record the 
minutes of meetings dated 27.01.2022. The same is 
taken on record as Mark-A, paragraph No.6 of which 
shows that after thorough and exhaustive discussion, 
parties were able to reach a conclusion for the purpose 
of 
normalizing 
operations 
of 
the 
Respondent 
No.1/Genome 
Pharmaceutical 
Pvt. 
Ltd. 
(the 
“Company”) and they made certain unanimous 
proposals for its revival.  
2. 
Mr. Nadeem Ahmad Sheikh, ASC submits that 
they could not decide the name of Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO) from the Directors. However, he submits 
that the Petitioners are agreed for appointment of a 
“Professional CEO” with mutual understanding after 
taking joint interview by the Directors. He adds that till 
the appointment of Professional CEO, wife of the 
Respondent No.3/Mr. Faisal Zafar may act as CEO of 
the Company. He also prayed for third party audit of 

 
Civil Original No.06 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
the Company for the period of last five years. He also 
proposed three names for audit i.e. (i) Mr. Waqar 
Sharif of AHW & Co, (ii) Laeeq Rana of Ishtiaq Rana 
& Co. and (iii) Ali Rafique of Riaz Ahmad Saqib Gohar 
& Co. Mr. Faisal Zafar is agreed to aforesaid 
proposals.  
3. 
In view of above, in order to avoid any further 
dispute, it is directed that both the Parties shall appoint 
Professional C.E.O. of the company by advertising the 
said post in the newspapers within a period of three 
(03) months. However, in the meanwhile, as agreed 
between the Parties, as an interim arrangement, Mrs. 
Tehseen Zia wife of Faisal Zafar shall act as C.E.O. of 
the Company to run and manage its affairs. 
Furthermore M/s. Laeeq Rana of Ishtiaq Rana & Co. is 
hereby appointed as an Auditor to audit the Company’s 
accounts for the last five years.  
4. 
So for as the issue regarding their shareholdings 
both the parties seek some further time for its solution. 
Let them do so.  
5. 
This Court in the case reported as “Additional 
Registrar Companies v. Al-Qaim Textile Mills Ltd.” 
(2021 CLD 931) has already declared the “Securities 
and Exchange Commission of Pakistan” (the “SECP”) 
as Regulator of entire companies, therefore, the SECP 
shall look into the matter and assist the management of 
the Company for its revival procedure. In the 
meanwhile, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan 
(the “DRAP”) shall not interfere with the affairs of the 
Company, which was plead by the Respondents.   
6. 
Now to come up for further proceedings on 
08.02.2022. Learned counsel for the Petitioner shall 
submit a joint report alongwith way forward on or 
before the said date.” 
 
4. 
Thereafter on 08.02.2022, Civil Original No.04 of 2021 was 
disposed of with certain directions on the basis of settlement arrived at 
between the parties in the following manner: 
“Pursuant to the order dated 31.01.2022, learned 
counsel for the Petitioner has placed on record a 
supplemental proposal to run the affairs of the 
Respondent No.1/Genome Pharmaceutical Pvt. Ltd. 
(the “Company”). The same is taken on record as 
Mark-B. The last paragraph is re-produced as under: 
“All the directors mutually agreed to extend their 
support and full assistance towards the company’s 

 
Civil Original No.06 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
prosperity and betterment. Every director ensured to 
take all necessary actions required to create a friendly 
and congenial environment in the company. They also 
agreed to help revamp the operations by serving the 
company to the best of their knowledge. Any issue 
arises shall be dealt with mutual discussion. It was also 
agreed that after receiving court order, all necessary 
steps shall be taken immediately and all directors shall 
paly their role to make the company operational within 
shortest possible time.” 
2. 
Barrister Osama Amin Qazi, Advocate for the 
Respondent No.1/Company submits that the affairs of 
the Company/Factory will hopefully be functional 
within next three days. However, submits that the SECP 
be directed to update their record/Form(s) in the light 
of their amicable settlement.  
3. 
Mr. Adeel Peter, Advocate for SECP has 
submitted that they will do the needful if the Company 
approaches for up-dation of its record.   
4. 
Mr. Nadeem Ahmad Sheikh, ASC submits that as 
the Parties have reached to the consensus regarding 
revival of the Company as per the submitted proposals 
i.e. Mark-A and B, therefore, this petition be disposed 
of being fructified.  
5. 
In view of above, the SECP shall update the 
record of the Company in accordance with law. 
However, as recorded in the order dated 31.01.2022, 
the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (the 
“DRAP”) shall not interfere with the affairs of the 
Company. Learned Law Officer shall inform this order 
in writing to the DRAP to act in accordance with law.  
6. 
In view of above, this Petition stands disposed of 
being fructified.” 
 
5. 
During the pendency of Civil Original No.03 of 2021, the 
Petitioners filed the captioned Civil Original (C.O.No.06 of 2022) on 
07.09.2022 and further proceedings were carried out thereon. For the 
purpose of expeditious resolution of corporate disputes through 
mediation between the parties regarding the “Company”, certain 
orders have been passed, which have become fruitful and now today 
the Respondents No.1 and 2 have withdrawn Civil Original No.03 of 
2021.

Pursuant to order dated 19.09.2023, notices were issued to the 
Respondents, who filed their reports/replies. In order to make the 
“Company” running concern and for the purpose of resolution of 
corporate disputes through intervention of the Court, before any 
determination, this Court suggested the “ENE” through mediation in 
terms of Section 6 of the “Act” and pursuant thereto the parties 
started negotiation.  
II. 
PETITIONERS SUBMISSIONS 
7. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners Mr. Ahmer Bilal Soofi, 
Sr.ASC inter alia submitted that the Petitioners are members of the 
“Company”, and are competent to file this petition being holder of 
52.5 percent of shares collectively; that affairs of the “Company” are 
being conducted by the Respondents No.1 to 3 in unlawful and 
fraudulent manners and that too against the Articles of Memorandum 
of Association of the “Company”; that on similar issue, earlier the 
matter was agitated in Civil Original No.04 of 2021 which was 
amicably solved on the directions of this Court to settle the mater 
under the provisions of the “Act” and adopting the process of the 
“ENE”; that vide order dated 31.01.2022, under the course of the 
“ENE”, the Court directed the parties to appoint professional C.E.O. 
of the “Company” and besides this, direction was also issued to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (the “SECP”) to 
look into the matter and assist the management of the “Company” for 
its revival procedure as prime object of the Court as well as the parties 
was the smooth functioning of the “Company” for the purpose of 
employment, revenue, duties/taxes and the export. Thereafter, on 
08.02.2022, the said petition was disposed of being fructified due to a 
consensus arrived at between the parties about revival of the 
“Company”; that as per Section 6(11) of the “Act” every petition 
presented to a Company Judge is to be decided within one hundred 
and twenty days from the date of its presentation while under the 
provisions of Sub-Section (7) of this Section, the Company Judge can 

 
Civil Original No.06 of 2022

fix a date and allocate time for hearing of the case. Mr. Usman Jilani, 
Advocate has referred to the judgment passed by this Court in the case 
of Lt. General (Retd.) Mahmud Ahmad Akhtar and another versus M/s 
Allied Developers (Private) Limited and others (2022 CLD 718) 
(Rawalpindi Bench), in which the course/process of the “ENE” has 
been developed first time by this Court; that the Company is 
functioning, but Respondents No.1 o 3 have committed certain 
illegalities in running its affairs/management as mentioned in this 
petition and also supported by the evidence annexed with this petition, 
including (i) non-compliance of order dated 08.02.2022 (passed in 
C.O.No.04/2021); (ii) non-payment of salary to the employees; (iii) 
non-payment of electricity bills; (iv) negatively affecting the morale 
of the workers and causing resentment; (v) hindering in day to day 
operations; (vi) non-compliance with the SECP corporate guidelines; 
(vii) effect on export operations of the Company; and (viii) 
impracticality of the agreement under the consent decree. Fatima 
Midrar, Advocate pleads that the aforesaid earlier petition was 
disposed of by this Court due to a consensus arrived at between the 
parties with certain commitments regarding revival of the Company, 
but Respondents No.1 to 3 have not adhered to in stricto sensu, hence, 
this Petition.

LEGAL QUESTION 
10. 
The above discussion gives rise to the following legal 
question: 
Whether a corporate dispute under Sections 
286 and 287 of the “Act” alleging the 
mismanagement of members of a company be 
resolved through mediation and compromise 
before passing any determination by the 
Court? 
 
V. 
RESOLUTION OF CORPORATE DISPUTE 
11. 
During proceedings of the case, on 12.10.2022, Mr. Ahmer 
Bilal Soofi, Sr.ASC proposed the appointment of a Chartered 
Accountant by this Court for better resolution of issue of deadlock 
between the parties holding fifty percent shares equally on the 
parameters set out by this Court in paragraph No.26 of the judgment 
cited as “NADEEM KIANI versus M/s AMERICAN LYCETUFF (PVT) 
LIMITED and others” (2021 CLD 7).   
12. 
M/s Usman Jillani and Samar Masood, Advocates appeared on 
behalf of the Petitioner and highlighted that powers of the Courts to 
resolve litigation amongst parties have been time and again 
recognized and approved around the globe. They have referred to 
following cases: 
(a) 
United States Court of Appeal, First Circuit, in re Atlantic 
Pipe Corp. (304 F.3d 135 (1st Cir. 2002) decided on 
September 18, 2002, wherein it is held that “Does a district 
court possess the authority to compel an unwilling party to 
participate in, and share the costs of, non-binding mediation 
conducted by a private mediator? We hold that a court may 
order mandatory mediation pursuant to an explicit statutory 
provision or local rule. We further hold that where, as here, no 
such authorizing medium exists, a court nonetheless may order 
mandatory mediation through the use of its inherent powers as 

 
Civil Original No.06 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 
long as the case is an appropriate one and the order contains 
adequate safeguards. … Even apart from positive law, district 
courts have substantial inherent power to manage and control 
their calendars. … this inherent power takes many forums … 
By way of illustration, a district court may use its inherent 
power to compel represented clients to attend pretrial 
settlement conferences, even though such a practice is not 
specifically authorized in the Civil Rules. … First, inherent 
powers must be used in a way reasonably suited to the 
enhancement of the court’s processes, including the orderly 
and expeditious disposition of pending cases. … Second 
inherent powers cannot be exercised in a manner that 
contradicts an applicable statute of rule. … Third, the use of 
inherent powers must comport with procedural fairness. … 
And, finally, inherent powers “must be exercised with restraint 
and discretion. … Mindful of these potential advantage, we 
hold that its is within a district court’s inherent power to order 
non-consensual mediation in those cases in which that step 
seems reasonably likely to serve the interest of justice …” 
(b) 
The United States District Court, N.D. Illinois, Eastern 
Division 
observed 
In 
re 
African-American 
Slave 
Descendants’ Litigation MLD No.1491, Lead Case No.02 C 
7764  (307 F. Supp. 2d 977 (N.D. Ill. 2004) that “The 
Supreme Court has long held that “the inherent powers of 
federal courts are those which are necessary to exercise of all 
others. … In this instance, the court does have the inherent 
power to order the parties to submit to non-binding 
mediation.”  
(c) 
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Court of First 
Instance, in re Personal Injuries Action No.707 of 2008, 
wherein it is observed in Paragraph No.35 that "… Mediation 
is a voluntary process and a party is not forced to undergo 

 
Civil Original No.06 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
mediation, but unreasonable refusal to attempt mediation 
(especially when the other party has made the request) is 
relevant conduct in litigation in the exercise of the discretion 
on costs. … It is better late than never, especially when time, 
expenses and uncertainty of the trial can be avoided.”  
(d) 
The Supreme Court of India in “M/s. Afcons Infra Ltd. & Anr 
vs M/s. Cherian Varkey Constn (2010 (8) SCC 24) (available 
at https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1875345/), wherein it is 
observed and held that “All other suits and cases of civil 
nature in particular the following categories of cases (whether 
pending in civil courts or other special Tribunals/Forums) are 
normally suitable for ADR processes. … If the parties are not 
agreeable for either arbitration or conciliation, both of which 
require consent of all parties, the court has to consider which 
of the other three ADR processes (Lok Adalat, Mediation and 
Judicial Settlement) which do not require the consent of 
parties for reference, is suitable and appropriate and refer the 
parties to such ADR process. … The court has used its 
discretion in choosing the ADR process judiciously, keeping in 
view the nature of disputes, interests of parties and expedition 
in dispute resolution. … The other four ADR processes are 
non-adjudicatory and the case does not go out of the stream of 
the court when a reference is made to such a non-adjudicatory 
ADR forum. The court retains its control and jurisdiction over 
the case, even when the matter is before the ADR forum. …. 
Where the reference is to a neutral third party (‘mediation’ as 
defined above) on a court reference, though it will be deemed 
to be reference to Lock Adalat, as court retains its control and 
jurisdiction over the matter, the mediation settlement will have 
to be placed before the court for recording the settlement and 
disposal.”

(available

that “Be that as it may, while dismissing the appeal, we 
relegate parties first to go for Mediation at the High Court, 
Mediation Centre and if the mediation fails, then the parties 
may do needful as directed by the Company Law Board in 
Paragraph-13 which is extracted herein below:

abeyance till the R-I Company is hereby required to 
keep the transfer of these shares in abeyance till the 
Company is able to produce the relevant records. ROC 
to keep the statutory statements in this regard as 
disputed. The Petitioners are at liberty to pursue their 
remedy before the appropriate forum regarding their 
allegation that the will is forged one.” 
 
VI. 
DETERMINATION 
 
13. 
As discussed above, in order to resolve the controversy 
between the parties before any determination, this Court suggested an 
“ENE” through mediation in terms of Preamble and Sections 6, 276 
and 277 of the “Act”. The Preamble elucidates that the “Act” has 
been enacted for the expeditious resolution of corporate disputes. The 
entire settlement was done by this Court by invoking the provisions of 
the “Act” in order to facilitate settlement between the parties and to 
avoid winding up which resulted into two separate companies, as 
mentioned in the settlement agreement. For ready reference, the 
Preamble of the “Act” is reproduced hereunder: 
 
 
Preamble: 
WHEREAS it is expedient to reform company law with 
the objective of facilitating corporatization and 
promoting 
development 
of 
corporate 
sector, 
encouraging use of technology and electronic means in 
conduct of business and regulation thereof, regulating 
corporate 
entities 
for 
protecting 
interests 
of 

 
Civil Original No.06 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 
shareholders, creditors, other stakeholders and general 
public, inculcating principles of good governance and 
safeguarding minority interests in corporate entities 
and providing an alternate mechanism for expeditious 
resolution of corporate disputes and matters arising out 
of or connected therewith; 
 
14. 
Significance of the Preamble of a statue for the purpose of 
interpretation of law has already been emphasized and highlighted 
by this Court in cases “Messrs Bahria Town (Pvt.) Ltd. through 
Manager (Operations) Vs. District Consumer Court, Rawalpindi 
and 2 others” (PLD 2022 Lahore 488), “Ch. Fayyaz Hussain Vs. 
Province of Punjab and others” (PLD 2022 Lahore 1),  “The 
Additional Registrar Company Vs Al-Qaim Textile Mills Limited” 
(2021 CLD 931) and “Messrs Jet Green (Pvt.) Limited Vs. 
Federation of Pakistan and others” (PLD 2021 Lahore 770) more 
or so with substance that “the preamble to a statute is though not an 
operational part of the enactment yet it is a gateway, which opens 
before us the purpose and intent of the legislature, which 
necessitated the legislation on the subject and also shed clear light 
on the goals which the legislator aimed to secure through the 
introduction of such law. The preamble of a statute, is therefore, 
holds a pivotal role for the purposes of interpretation in order to 
dissect the true purpose and intent of the law.” Moreover, it has 
been observed in case “Saif Ur Rehman Khan Vs. Securities and 
Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) through Chairman and 
2 others” (2022 CLD 1460) that “The object of promulgating the 
Act of 2017 has been described in its preamble as to reform and re-
enact the law relating to companies.” Relying upon preamble of the 
Act, in case Lt. Gen. (Retd.) Mahmud Ahmad Akhtar and another 
Vs. Messrs Allied Developers (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive 
and 3 others (2022 CLD 718), this Court has already elaborated 
that “The Preamble of the Act protects the interests of shareholders, 
creditors, other stakeholders and general public and provides an 
alternate mechanism for expeditious resolution of corporate 

 
Civil Original No.06 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13 
disputes.” It would further be quite relevant to mention here that in 
case “Tariq Iqbal Malik Vs. Messrs Multiplierz Group Pvt. Ltd. and 
4 others” (2022 CLD 468), this court has already observed and held 
that “The legislative intent of the Act is clear and obvious from its 
Preamble that it has been enacted to reform company law with the 
objective of facilitating corporatization and promoting development 
of corporate sector, encouraging use of technology and electronic 
means for protecting interests of shareholders, creditors, other 
stakeholders and general public, inculcating principles of good 
governance and safeguarding minority interest in corporate entities 
and providing an alternate mechanism for expeditious resolution of 
corporate disputes and matters arising out of or connected 
therewith”. Furthermore, Sections 276 and 277 of the “Act” are 
reproduced hereunder: 
Section 276. Mediation and Conciliation Panel:- (1) 
Any of the parties to the proceedings may, by mutual 
consent, at any time during the proceedings before the 
Commission or the Appellate Bench, apply to the 
Commission or the Appellate Bench, as the case may 
be, in such form along-with such fees as may be 
specified, for referring the matter pertaining to such 
proceedings to the Mediation and Conciliation Panel 
and the Commission or the Appellate Bench, as the 
case may be, shall appoint one or more individuals 
from the panel referred to in sub-section (2).  
(2) The Commission shall maintain a panel to be called 
as the Mediation and Conciliation Panel consisting of 
individuals having such qualifications as may be 
specified for mediation between the parties during the 
pendency of any proceedings before the Commission or 
the Appellate Bench under this Act.  
(3) The fee and other terms and conditions of 
individuals of the Mediation and Conciliation Panel 
shall be such as may be specified.  
(4) The Mediation and Conciliation Panel shall follow 
such procedure as and dispose of the matter referred to 
it within a period of ninety days from the date of such 
reference and forward its recommendations to the 
Commission or the Appellate Bench, as the case may 
be.

Section 
277. 
Resolution 
of 
disputes 
through 
mediation:- A company, its management or its 
members or creditors may by written consent, directly 
refer a dispute, claim or controversy arising between 
them or between the members or directors inter-se, for 
resolution, to any individuals enlisted on the mediation 
and conciliation panel maintained by the Commission 
before taking recourse to formal dispute resolution. 
 
15. 
It is to be noted that Section 276(2) of the Act requires the 
“SECP” to maintain a panel to be called “Mediation and Conciliation 
Panel” consisting of individuals having such qualifications as may be 
specified for mediation between the parties during the pendency of 
any proceedings before the “SECP” or the Appellate Bench. Section 
276(1) of the Act authorizes the parties to the proceedings before the 
“SECP” or the Appellate Bench to apply, with mutual consent, for 
referring the matter pertaining to such proceedings to the Mediation 
and Conciliation Panel. In addition, under Section 277 of the Act, a 
company, its management or its members or creditors may by written 
consent, directly refer a dispute, claim or controversy arising between 
them or between the members or directors inter-se, for resolution, to 
any individual enlisted on the mediation and conciliation panel 
maintained by the “SECP” before taking recourse to formal dispute 
resolution. 
16. 
It is important to mention here that there is no direct provision 
available in the “Act” regarding resolution of the corporate dispute 
through mediation between the parties, therefore, with the consent of 
the parties, this Court had referred the matter to the “SECP” to 
assume the jurisdiction and to expedite the matter in terms of Sections 
280 and 282 of the “Act”, which provisions empower the “SECP” to 
enforce/sanction of a compromise or an arrangement in respect of a 
Company, because this Court in the case reported as “Additional 
Registrar Companies v. Al-Qaim Textile Mills Ltd.” (2021 CLD 931) 
has already declared the “SECP” as Regulator of entire companies. 
Thus, Mr. Muzaffar Ahmad Mirza, Chief Prosecutor/Executive 

 
Civil Original No.06 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15 
Director, Legal Affairs, SECP, was directed to support the parties for 
resolution of the matter. In said connection, for ready reference 
Sections 280 and 282 read as under: 
Section 280. Power of Commission to enforce 
compromises and arrangements:- (1) Where the 
Commission makes an order under section 279 
sanctioning a compromise or an arrangement in 
respect of a company, it may, at the time of making 
such order or at any time thereafter, give such 
directions in regard to any matter or make such 
modifications in the compromise or arrangement as it 
may consider necessary for the proper working of the 
compromise or arrangement. 
(2) If the Commission is satisfied that a compromise or 
arrangement sanctioned under section 279 cannot be 
worked satisfactorily with or without modification, it 
may, initiate proceedings for the winding up of the 
company. 
Section 281. … 
Section 282. Powers of Commission to facilitate 
reconstruction or amalgamation of companies:- (1) 
Where an application is made to the Commission under 
section 279 to sanction a compromise or arrangement 
and it is shown that—  
(a) the compromise or arrangement is proposed for the 
purposes of, or in connection with, a scheme for the 
reconstruction of any company or companies, or the 
amalgamation of any two or more companies or 
division of a company into one or more companies;  
(c) under the scheme the whole or any part of the 
undertaking or property or liabilities of any company 
concerned in the scheme (“a transferor company”) is 
to be transferred to another company (“the transferee 
company”) or is proposed to be divided among and 
transferred to two or more companies; and  
 
 
17. 
The concept of corporate dispute resolution through 
mediation in the commercial matter and other alternate sources is 
not alien to system as it has already been held in case “Messrs 
U.I.G. (Pvt.) Limited through Director and 3 others Vs. Muhammad 
Imran Qureshi” (2011 CLC 758) that “the Court to bring an end to 
the controversy and for expeditious disposal of case by consent of the 

 
Civil Original No.06 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16 
parties may adopt any alternate method of dispute resolution 
including mediation, conciliation or any other means”. Furthermore, 
it 
has 
held 
in 
case 
“Messrs 
ALSTOM 
Power 
Generation through Ashfaq Ahmad Vs. Pakistan Water and Power 
Development Authority through Chairman and another” (PLD 
2007 Lahore 581) that “The Courts are also expected 
to encourage the parties to adopt such modes in view of 
provisions of S.89-A and Order X, R.1(1-A) of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908. It is now a universally accepted method 
being followed as a less expensive less time consuming, less 
cumbersome and ultimately a fruitful and beneficial mode, 
commonly known as ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution).” 
Mediation’ outcomes not only save time and money of parties, but it 
also reduces load of work in the courts as well as it is a most updated 
way on resolutions based on the ” divine culture of Peace”.  
18. 
It is settled by Supreme Court of Pakistan in a number of 
judgments holding it essential that mediation offers a voluntary and 
confidential alternative to traditional court proceedings for resolving 
disputes. In this process, disputing parties willingly engage in 
discussions facilitated by a neutral third party known as the mediator. 
Unlike court proceedings, mediation is a more informal and flexible 
approach, fostering open communication and creative problem-
solving. The mediator's role is not to make decisions but to guide the 
parties in finding common ground and exploring potential solutions. 
One of the key advantages of mediation is its cost-effectiveness 
compared to court proceedings. It also tends to be a faster method of 
resolution, putting more control in the hands of the parties involved. 
The informality of mediation contributes to a quicker resolution 
compared to the often time-consuming nature of court proceedings. 
Additionally, the process preserves relationships, as parties actively 
engage in finding mutually agreeable solutions. The flexibility of 

 
Civil Original No.06 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17 
mediation allows for a more personalized and tailored resolution to 
the specific needs and concerns of the parties involved. 
19. 
Accordingly, as discussed above, a corporate dispute or 
petition under Sections 286 and 287 of the “Act” alleging the 
mismanagement of members of a company may be resolved through 
mediation and compromise before passing any determination by the 
Court with the consent of the parties involved in such dispute, since 
the law permits it. 
20. 
So, keeping in light broader, wider and long-lasting prospects 
as well as fetching guideline from preamble alongwith Sections 6, 276 
and 277 of the “Act”, mediation was set forth amongst parties 
supervised by the quarters of regulatory authority i.e. the “SECP”, 
which mediation has worked and met with desired fruits as well with 
mutual coordination and cooperation of learned counsel for the 
parties.  
21. 
Pursuant to orders dated 19.09.2022, 12.10.2022, 24.10.2022, 
15.12.2022, 16.05.2023, 20.06.2023, the parties have submitted

On the request of learned counsel for the Petitioners that the 
“SECP” should expedite the issue with regard to division of company 
and change of its name, Mr. Muzaffar Ahmad Mirza, Chief 
Prosecutor/Executive Director, Legal Affairs, SECP was directed to 
support the parties in this regard. On 04.10.2023, in order to move 
forward for the execution of the aforesaid agreement and resolution of 
the dispute, learned counsel for the Parties were directed to place on 
record a roadmap. Today, learned counsel for Parties submitted report

23. 
In view of the judgments referred to in corporate matters 
regarding the mediation, the principles common in all of them are that 
the company law is to protect and look after the interest of shareholders 
and in this case, the parties have settled through the role of this Court 
because of linking section 6 read with Sections 276 and 277 of the 
“Act”, hence it is the duty of the company judge to protect the interest 
of the “Company” and minimize adverse effect to it. Based on the 

 
Civil Original No.06 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20 
strong principles to safeguard the interest of the “Company” and to 
resolve corporate dispute developed by Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
various judgments, this Court is of the view that Section 276 and 277 of 
the “Act” can be invoked in order to protect the interest of the 
“Company” and the Court can initiate process of the “ENE” and then 
mediation.  
24. 
In view of above said compromise/concurrence of the parties, 
this petition stands disposed of. However, under the doctrine of 
continuous mandamus as observed in the judgment of this Court, 
“MALL ROAD TRADERS ASSOCIATION Versus The DEPUTY 
COMMISSIONER, LAHORE” (2019 CLC 744), the parties shall 
adhere to the aforesaid compromise deed (Mark-A) and the “SECP”, 
being regulator, shall facilitate them with regard to division of the 
Company and decide their matter arising out of mediation. The Court 
also appreciate the role of the “SECP”, its Chairman and Chief 
Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the parties including Mr. 
Nadeem Ahmad Sheikh, ASC and Barrister Osama Amin Qazi, who 
convened the meetings between the parties for intended mediation.
