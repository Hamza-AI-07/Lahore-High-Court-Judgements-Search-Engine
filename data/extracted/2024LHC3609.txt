Order Ordinance, 1960 (‘MPO, 1960’), on 25th 
July 2024 and 26th July 2024, pursuant thereto

On merits of the detention orders, learned law 
officer refers to a report, placed on record today, 
signed by the District Police Officer, Rahim Yar 
Khan. District Police Officer and Deputy 
Commissioner, Rahim Yar Khan, to demonstrate

detention is essential to secure public peace, 
tranquility and prevent disturbance.  
4. 
Heard. Detention orders replicate in content, 
except name(s) / identity(ies) of the persons 
referred therein. One of the detention order of 
26.07.2024, available at page 22 of this petition, 
ordering detention of one Shabbir Ali, son of 
Khadim Hussain, is read with the assistance of law 
officer, text whereof, for convenience’s sake, is 
reproduced hereunder, 
“WHEREAS, 
the 
District 
Police 
Officer, 
Rahimyarkhan vide his letter No.3465/SB dated 
25.07.2024 has stated that as per report of SHO, PS 
“City Khanpur”, Shabbir Ali s/o Khadim Hussain 
Caste Pahoor R/o Model Town Khanpur is a 
quarrelsome/ combative type of person. He is 
involved in instigating people to participate in anti 
state campaign, which can disturb the law & order 
situation and endanger the lives and properties of

situation, if he remains free, he will indulge in the

of the locality are feeling insecurity. 
2. 
AND 
WHEREAS, 
Under 
the 
above 
circumstances, 
DPO, 
Rahimyarkhan 
has 
recommended that in order to prevent the said anti-
social element from his unlawful activities and acting 
in a manner prejudicial to the public safety and the 
maintenance of public order, he may be detained u/s 
3(1) MPO, 1960 for a period of 30 days in the public 
interest.  
3. 
WHEREAS, Considering the above said 
grounds given by the DPO, Rahimyarkhan, I am fully 
satisfied that in order to prevent the said person from 
acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety and 
the maintenance of public order, his detention is

4. 
NOW THEREFORE, I Khurram Pervaiz,

5. 
The detainee is at liberty to make 
representation to Government of the Punjab against 
this order. 
6. 
Given under my hand on this 26th day of July, 
2024.” 
5. 
Perusal of detention order indicates reference 
to some letter No.3465/SB dated 25.07.2024 – [on 
perusal 
letter 
bears 
No.3466/SB 
dated 
25.07.2024] - of District Police Officer, Rahim 
Yar Khan. It is appropriate to reproduce contents 
of referred letter, which read as, 
“Subject: 
REQUEST FOR ISAUNCE OF 
DETENTION ORDER U/S 3-MPO. 
Memorandum: 
Kindly refer to the subject cited above. 

 
W.P. No.5770/2024.

2. 
It is stated that as per report submitted by 
SHO PS City Khanpur, Shabbir Ali s/o Khadim 
Hussain Caste Pahoor r/o Model Town Khanpur is 
a quarrelsome/combative type of person. He is 
involved in instigating the people to participate in 
anti-state campaign, which can disturb the law & 
order situation and endanger the lives and properties 
of General Public of this district. 
 
3. 
In prevailing situation, if he remains free, he 
will indulge in the activities prejudicial to public 
peace and tranquility. His activities are dangerous 
to public health and creating disharmony in the area 
due to which, people of the locality are feeling 
insecurity.  
 
4. 
In view of the above, it is requested that an 
order under section 3-MPO may be issued against 
him for a period of 30-days in order to restrain him 
from indulging in the activities prejudicial to public 
and maintenance of law & order, please. 
 
District Police Officer, 
Rahim Yar Khan.” 
6. 
Heard. 
7. 
Objection regarding availability of alternate 
remedy is repelled on the premise that order of 
detention is inherently defective, which evidently 
fails to meet the statutory test for encumbering 
one’s personal liberty / freedom, reasons provided 
infra. In the circumstances, claim of alternate 
remedy is misconceived and not adequate and 
efficacious to cure illegality and incidence of 
abdication of jurisdiction. There is no cavil that 
law permitting preventive detention has to be 
construed strictly. No reinventing of wheel is 
required; jurisprudence regarding scope of 
preventive detention, embodied in section 3(1) 
MPO, 1960, is well-settled, which expounds that 

 
W.P. No.5770/2024. 
 
-:5:- 
 
 
justification and justiciability of a detention order 
has to be ascertained and adjudged in the context 
of the material / evidence, available and referred 
to in the order and sufficient enough to meet 
exception to the fundamental rights, guaranteed 
under the Constitution of Pakistan – [Article 10 
provides for such preventive detention subject to 
the law, which is MPO, 1960]. Perusal of 
detention order(s) manifest broad-spectrum / 
general allegations, attributing participation in 
anti-state campaign – which insinuations followed 
by repetitive cliché / platitudinous expressions in 
the text of detention order(s). When asked to 
provide specific facts / circumstances that led to 
the passing of detention orders, learned law officer 
emphasized that each of the detainee had previous 
criminal record, who responded to the query, that 
whether such details were refereed to or indicated 
in the detention orders or letter by District Police 
Officer, Rahim Yar Khan, with deafening silence. 
Details of any criminal case was not referred in the 
detention orders. It is unexplained that how mere 
registration of criminal cases – [It is evident that 
case FIR No.695/24 u/s 341/188/186/148/149 
PPC PS Kotsmaba, and FIR No.536/23 u/s 
341/188/148/149 PPC 16-MPO PS Saddar 

 
W.P. No.5770/2024.

Khanpur] -would make detainee Anti-State 
campaigner” – often used cliché, which is akin to 
a “lawfare mechanism” adopted these days to 
cause problems for opponent(s) and presently so  
frequently employed that it lost credibility and 
even fails to meet straight face / giggle test. This 
is serious allegation and has had to be justified 
with compelling reasons/grounds conspicuously 
absent. Registration of case does not per se justify 
the preventive detention – See the case of “MRS. 
ARSHAD ALI KHAN. VS. GOVERNMENT OF 
THE PUNJAB through Secretary, Home.” (1994 
SCMR 1532). Contents of the detention orders 
smacks of mala-fide, whereby 28 persons are 
deprived of their liberty / freedom – on trumped-
up allegations, surmises and conjectural basis, 
when no tangible evidence or sufficient support 
material is produced / shown to justify the grounds 
for preventive detention, which amount to an 
incidence of malice-in-law. Reference is made to 
the ratio in the case of “BEGUM NAZIR ABDUL 
HAMID. 
VS. 
PAKISTAN 
(FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT) THROUGH THE SECRETARY, 
INTERIOR, 
DIVISION 
ISLAMABAD 
and 
another.” (PLD 1974 Lahore 7), relevant portion 
therefrom is reproduced hereunder,  

 
W.P. No.5770/2024. 
 
-:7:- 
 
 
“An order of detention is mala fide if it is 
made for a “collateral” or “ulterior” 
purpose, i.e. a purpose other than what the 
Legislature had in view in passing the law of 
preventive detention. In Shearer v. Shields 
(1) it was held that the person who inflicts a 
wrong or an injury upon a person in 
contravention of the law is not allowed to say 
that he did so with an innocent mind. It is 
“malice in law”, although so far as his mind 
is concerned, he may have acted honestly or 
innocently. The malice in law is to be inferred 
when an order is made contrary to the objects 
and purposes of the Act, or the rules made 
thereunder. It is not enough that the order is 
passed under a colour of the power 
conferred. It must be done in actual exercise 
of it and no power is conferred to make such 
an order in abuse of the Act.” 
8. 
This appears to be a textbook case of misuse 
qua exercise of discretion and authority.  
9. 
In view of the above, detention orders under 
reference are declared illegal and of no legal effect 
and directions are made for forthwith release of 
persons, mentioned in Schedule-A, provided same 
are not required in any other criminal case.
