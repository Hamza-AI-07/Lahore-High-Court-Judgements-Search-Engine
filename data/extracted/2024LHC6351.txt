For the Petitioners: 
Mr. Abid Ali Bodla, Advocate. 
For the Respondents: 
Mr. Nadeem Ahmad Tarar, Deputy Attorney 
General, and Mr. Adnan Latif Sheikh, Deputy 
Prosecutor General, with Captain (R) Muhammad 
Khurram Agha (Secretary Interior), Zia-ul-Haq  
(Deputy 
Secretary 
Interior),

Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – On 20.7.2024, Sub-Inspector 
Muhammad Abu Bakar, Shift Incharge at FIA Immigration, Multan 
International Airport, submitted a report to FIA AHTC Multan regarding 
eight passengers travelling to Saudi Arabia via Muscat on SalamAir 
Flight OV-538, who aroused suspicion during immigration screening. 
Upon further inquiry, it was found that they lacked sufficient financial 
resources (some carrying only 500 Riyals), had not confirmed return 
tickets or mandatory hotel bookings, and were unfamiliar with the 
requirements of performing Umrah. During baggage searches, authorities 
seized 900 boxes of “Captain” brand cigarettes and 70 boxes of Velo 
nicotine pouches.

The passengers were offloaded, and further interrogation 
revealed that they were all relatives. Passenger Sadiq Hussain

(Petitioner No.1) had instigated them to travel to Saudi Arabia for 
begging. 
Sadiq 
Hussain 
and 
his 
associates, 
Ghulam 
Nazik  
(Petitioner No.2), Muhammad Ijaz, and Yasin, charged Rs.160,000/- to 
Rs.170,000/- for each visa without hotel bookings and received 
Rs.70,000/- to Rs.100,000/- as an advance payment from them. The 
remaining balance was to be paid after the passengers engaged in begging 
in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, it was agreed that Sadiq Hussain and his 
associates would receive a commission from the earnings generated 
through begging. 
3. 
 
Based on the above report, FIR No. 215/2024 dated 
20.7.2024 was registered under sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of 
Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018 (PTPA), section 22 of the Emigration 
Ordinance, 1979, and section 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). 
4. 
 
The Petitioners have filed this petition under Article 199 of 
the 
Constitution of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Pakistan, 1973  
(the “Constitution”), seeking the quashing of FIR No. 215/2024. They 
contend that the Respondents’ actions violate fundamental rights 
guaranteed by the Constitution, specifically Articles 15 and 20, which 
safeguard the right to travel and the freedom to practice religion, 
including the right to perform Umrah. The Petitioners further argue that 
neither sections 3 and 4 of the PTPA nor section 22 of the Emigration 
Ordinance are applicable in this case. Consequently, FIR No. 215/2024 is 
patently illegal. 
5. 
 
This Court issued notice to the Respondents who have filed 
their para-wise comments. 
6. 
 
The Deputy Attorney General submitted that Pakistan 
ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime (UNTOC) in 2011 and, to fulfill its international obligations, 
enacted the PTPA and the Prevention of Smuggling of Migrants Act, 
2018 (PSMA). Subsequently, the Federal Government, exercising powers 
under section 15 of the PTPA, framed the Prevention of Trafficking in 
Persons Rules, 2020, which were notified on 22.10.2020 (PTP Rules). 
Rule 2(l)(ix) of the PTP Rules defines “debt bondage” in a manner broad 
enough to encompass activities such as begging and forced begging.

7. 
 
The Deputy Attorney General apprised that during recent 
months, complaints have surged from various countries, particularly 
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, and Malaysia, that Pakistani citizens go 
there and engage in begging. In September 2023, the Ministry of 
Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development (MOP & HRD) 
informed the Senate Standing Committee that nearly 90% of deportations 
linked to begging charges involved Pakistanis.1 The Director General of 
FIA took cognizance of the situation and directed FIA Immigration to act 
against criminal networks facilitating forced beggary and bonded labour. 
Reinforcing these efforts, the Ministry of Interior issued a directive 
[F.No.11/1/2024-Pass (P&C) dated 2.7.2024] titled “Strict Action Against 
Begging Syndicates in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and 
Malaysia.” This directive mandated strict measures against deportees 
found engaged in begging and against travel agents and syndicates 
supporting or coordinating such activities. 
8. 
 
The Deputy Attorney General emphasized that, as a 
signatory to the UNTOC and to maintain friendly relations with countries 
that have specifically raised complaints against Pakistani citizens, the 
Federal Government must take measures to curb the outflow of beggars. 
To this end, all passengers travelling abroad are interviewed at 
immigration counters at airports. Particular attention is given to those 
travelling to Saudi Arabia, who must undergo comprehensive screening 
and profiling to verify their eligibility and authenticity as Umrah pilgrims 
or visitors. As part of this process, Umrah pilgrims are required to 
demonstrate possession of sufficient Saudi Riyals to cover their expenses. 
Failure to meet this requirement leads to further interrogation to ascertain 
their intent and prevent abuse of the system. 
9. 
 
The Deputy Attorney General defended the registration of 
FIR No.215/2024, arguing that sections 3 & 4 of the PTPA and section 22 
of the Emigration Ordinance, read with section 109 PPC, apply to the 
facts and circumstances of the instant case and have been rightly invoked 
                                          
1 According to the latest data submitted to this Court by the FIA, during last one year, a total of 4,663 
Pakistanis were deported from various countries for involvement in beggary, with 4,347 of them being 
deported from Saudi Arabia alone.

guilty during the investigation. 
Opinion of the Court 
10. 
 
Beggary is a complex social issue often rooted in poverty, 
lack of opportunities, and systemic inequalities. It typically involves 
individuals soliciting alms in public spaces, either as a means of survival 
or due to circumstances beyond their control, such as displacement, 
unemployment, or physical and mental disabilities. Despite being 
perceived as a societal concern, the approach to addressing beggary varies 
widely across legal systems and cultural contexts. Many jurisdictions 
criminalize the act, viewing it as a public nuisance or a reflection of 
societal decay. Conversely, some countries adopt a rehabilitative 
approach, focusing on providing education, employment, and social 
welfare programmes to reintegrate individuals into society.  
The Punjab Vagrancy Ordinance 1958, and The Punjab Destitute and 
Neglected Children Act 2004 
11. 
 
In Pakistan, the Sind Vagrancy Act of 1947 was the first law 
that addressed issues related to vagrancy, including beggary. It was 
repealed by the West Pakistan Vagrancy Ordinance of 1958, which 
became the governing framework on the subject. While Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa replaced the Ordinance with its own legislation, Act No. 
VIII of 2020,2 the other three provinces and the Islamabad Capital 
Territory continue to follow the 1958 Ordinance, incorporating 
amendments tailored to their specific needs. 
12. 
 
Under section 2(g) of the Punjab Vagrancy Ordinance, 1958 
(the “Vagrancy Ordinance”), a “vagrant” is defined as any person who 
solicits or receives alms in a public place, exhibits or exposes wounds, 
deformities, or diseases to evoke sympathy, allows himself to be used as 
an exhibit to solicit or receive alms, or enters private premises uninvited 
for such purposes. However, the definition excludes individuals 
collecting money, food, or gifts for purposes authorized under prescribed 
rules and duly certified. This nuanced definition ensures that the law 
targets exploitative or habitual practices associated with vagrancy while

exempting legitimate charitable activities. The Ordinance adopts a 
balanced approach, combining punitive measures with welfare-oriented 
initiatives. It criminalizes vagrancy and provides for apprehending and 
prosecuting individuals identified as vagrants. Simultaneously, it 
incorporates mechanisms for their social and economic rehabilitation. 
Welfare homes established under the Ordinance are central to these 
efforts, providing housing, vocational training, and medical care to 
facilitate the reintegration of vagrants into society as productive 
members. 
13. 
 
Section 9 of the Vagrancy Ordinance stipulates punishment 
for vagrancy, and section 10 for employing or causing persons to ask 
alms. Section 19 states that all offences under this Ordinance are 
cognizable and bailable. 
14. 
 
The Punjab Destitute and Neglected Children Act, 2004, 
complements the Vagrancy Ordinance by focusing specifically on the 
protection and rehabilitation of destitute and neglected children. It defines 
such children to include those found begging or without a fixed place of 
abode.3 The Act establishes mechanisms for their rescue, protective 
custody, care, and rehabilitation, including the creation of child protection 
institutions and the appointment of child protection officers. Additionally, 
it criminalizes the exploitation of children for begging, imposing 
penalties on those who employ or use children for such purposes. 
15. 
 
Part VIII of the 2014 Act criminalizes various acts of 
beggary involving children and prescribes punishments for such offences. 
Section 42 declares that all offences under the Act are cognizable and 
bailable. 
16. 
 
Often, a person or a group of persons acting on behalf of one 
or more organized criminal groups use force, fraud, or coercion to exploit 
vulnerable people to solicit alms, turning them into instruments of profit 
under the guise of beggary. Victims – frequently children, women, the 
elderly, or those with disabilities – are subjected to appalling conditions. 
Many are abducted, trafficked, or forced into beggary, often under debt 
                                          
3 Under section 3(1)(e) of the Punjab Destitute and Neglected Children Act, 2004, “child” means a 
natural person who has not attained the age of eighteen years.

bondage, where fabricated or inflated debts are used to exert control. 
Their handlers or creditors seize most, if not all, of their earnings,

The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
17. 
 
The United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, 
adopted by General Assembly resolution 55/25 of 15 November 2000, is 
the leading international instrument in the fight against transnational 
organized crime.4 It entered into force on 29 September 2003, and nearly 
all UN member States are parties to it. The Convention aims to promote 
international cooperation, harmonize laws, and strengthen the capacity of 
States to combat transnational organized crime. It defines an organized 
criminal group as a structured group of three or more individuals working 
together to commit serious crimes5 for financial or material gain.  
18. 
 
The UNTOC is supplemented by three Protocols, which 
target specific areas and manifestations of organized crime: The Protocol 
to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
Women and Children; the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by 
Land, Sea and Air; and the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of 
and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and 
Ammunition. Countries must first become parties to the Convention 
before they can accede to any of the Protocols.6 
19. 
 
States that ratify UNTOC commit themselves to take a series 
of measures against transnational organized crime, including the creation 
of domestic criminal offences (participation in an organized criminal 
group, money laundering, corruption, and obstruction of justice); the 
adoption of new and sweeping frameworks for extradition, mutual legal 
                                          
4 According to paragraph 2 of Article 3 of UNTOC, an offence is transnational in nature if: (a) It is 
committed in more than one State; (b) It is committed in one State but a substantial part of its 
preparation, planning, direction or control takes place in another State; (c) It is committed in one State 
but involves an organized criminal group that engages in criminal activities in more than one State; or 
(d) It is committed in one State but has substantial effects in another State. 
5 Article 2(b) of UNTOC defines “serious crime” to mean conduct constituting an offence punishable 
by a maximum deprivation of liberty of at least four years or a more serious penalty;

Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018 
20. 
 
Pakistan ratified UNTOC in 2010. Although it has yet to 
ratify the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children (TIP Protocol), it has taken 
significant legislative steps to combat trafficking in persons. It has 
enacted the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018 (PTPA) and 
the Prevention of Smuggling of Migrants Act, 2018 (PSMA). 
21. 
 
For our present purpose, the PTPA is relevant. This Act 
comprehensively 
criminalizes 
human 
trafficking, 
encompassing 
recruitment, transportation, and exploitation of individuals through 
coercion, fraud, or abuse of power. Section 3 of the Act states: 
3. Trafficking in persons – (1) Any person who recruits, harbours, 
transports, provides or obtains another person, or attempts to do so, for 
compelled labour or commercial sex acts through the use of force, 
fraud or coercion, commits an offence of trafficking in persons and 
shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to seven years 
or with fine which may extend to one million rupees or with both. 
(2) 
If the offence of trafficking in persons under sub-section (1) is 
committed against a child or a woman, the person who commits the 
offence shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to ten 
years and which shall not be less than two years or with fine which 
may extend to one million rupees or with both. 
(3) 
In this section: 
(a) 
“coercion” means use or threat of use of force, or other forms 
of non-violent use of force including –  
(i) 
threat of harm to or physical restraint of any person; 
(ii) 
any scheme, plan or pattern intended to cause a person 
to believe that failure to perform an act would result in 
serious harm to or physical restraint of any person; 
(iii) 
threat due to the vulnerable position of a person; or 
(iv) 
psychological pressure; and 
(b) 
“compelled labour” includes involuntary servitude, slavery or 
practices similar to slavery, or debt bondage and forced labour. 
22. 
 
Section 4 of the PTPA outlines aggravating circumstances. It 
stipulates that where an offence under section 3 involves (a) serious 
injury, life-threatening illness, or death of the victim or another person;  
(b) activity of an organized criminal group; (c) confiscation or destruction 
                                          
7 ibid. 

Writ Petition No.12935/2024

of any travel document of the victim; or (d) repetition of the offence by 
the same offender; the offender shall be punished with imprisonment 
which may extend to fourteen years and which shall not be less than three 
years and fine which may extend to two million rupees. The Explanation 
to section 4 defines “organized criminal group” as a structured group of 
two or more persons, existing for a period of time and acting in concert 
with the aim of committing any offence under this Act, in order to obtain, 
directly or indirectly, any financial or other material benefit.  
23. 
 
Section 5 of the PTPA addresses abetment and criminal 
conspiracy. Sub-section (1) provides that any person who participates as 
an accomplice, aids, or abets an offence under section 3 or section 4 shall 
be punished in accordance with Chapter V of the Pakistan Penal Code. 
Sub-section (2) specifies that any person who is part of a criminal 
conspiracy to commit an offence under section 3 or section 4 shall be 
punished in accordance with Chapter V-A of the Code. 
24. 
 
The PTPA’s interpretation of “coercion” and “compelled 
labour” under section 3 is pivotal for understanding the scope of the Act. 
“Coercion”, as defined in section 3(3)(a) of the Act, encompasses a range 
of actions that control or exploit individuals through direct or indirect 
pressure. It includes threats of physical force, psychological means such 
as threats of harm or restraint, and non-violent methods like exploiting 
vulnerability or applying psychological pressure to create the belief that 
there is no option but to comply with the trafficker’s demands. 
25. 
 
According to section 3(3)(b) of the PTPA, “compelled 
labour” includes involuntary servitude, slavery, or practices similar to 
slavery, or debt bondage and forced labour. The term “debt bondage” is 
defined in Rule 2(1)(ix) of the PTP Rules as follows: 
(ix) 
“debt bondage” means the status or condition of a debtor 
arising from a pledge by the debtor of his or her personal services or of 
those of a person under his or her control as a security for debt, if the 
value of those services as reasonably assessed is not applied toward the 
liquidation of the debt or the length and nature of those services are not 
respectively limited and defined. 
26. 
 
It is significant that the definition of “compelled labour” in 
section 3(3)(b) of the PTPA is not exhaustive, which is reflected from the 
use of the word “includes”. It is well established that the words 

Writ Petition No.12935/2024 
 
 
 
- 9 - 
“includes” or the expression “shall be deemed to include” in the 
interpretation clause of a statute are used to broaden the scope of a term, 
encompassing a wider range of situations beyond its conventional 
meaning.8  
27. 
 
The terms “coercion” and “compelled labour” underscore the 
PTPA’s recognition of modern trafficking dynamics, where traffickers 
exploit vulnerabilities and systemic pressures rather than relying solely on 
physical force or overt abuse. By addressing these subtler forms of 
exploitation, the Act ensures a comprehensive response to trafficking in 
all its evolving manifestations. Section 3 of the PTPA, read with Rule 
2(l)(ix) of the PTP Rules, aligns with Article 3(a) of the TIP Protocol, the 
internationally agreed definition of “trafficking in persons.”9 
28. 
 
Under the PTPA, beggary does not inherently constitute 
trafficking unless it involves elements meeting the legal threshold of 
trafficking as stipulated in section 3(1), i.e., coercion, fraud, 
manipulation, or other forms of exploitation by a third party. Even when 
beggary is limited in duration – such as cases bound by visa restrictions – 
it can still be classified as trafficking under the PTPA if exploitative 
elements are present. The Act focuses on the methods and conditions of 
exploitation rather than the duration. 
29. 
 
Importantly, even in cases of apparent voluntariness, 
economic exploitation such as compelled labour or debt bondage – where 
handlers exert systematic control over earnings or create economic 
dependency – can transform seemingly voluntary beggary into 
trafficking.  
                                          
8 Don Bosco High School v. The Assistant Director. E.O.B.I. and others (PLD 1989 SC 128), Mushtaq 
Ahmad v. The State (1991 SCMR 543), UCC Private Limited and others v. Deputy Commissioner, 
Lahore (1999 MLD 1186). 
9 Article 3(a) of the TIP Protocol states: 
(a) Trafficking in persons” shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or 
receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of 
abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or 
of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person 
having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall 
include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of 
sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, 
servitude or the removal of organs.    
The intention behind the agreed definition is to facilitate convergence in national approaches 
regarding the establishment of domestic criminal offences that would support efficient international 
cooperation in investigating and prosecuting trafficking in persons cases. (Legislative Guides for the 
Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the 
Protocols Thereto, published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime).

The determination of whether trafficking in persons exists 
within the meaning of the PTPA, particularly whether “coercion” or 
“compelled labour” is involved, is fundamentally a question of fact. Each 
case must be evaluated on its specific circumstances, evidence, and the 
intent of the alleged trafficker to determine whether the statutory 
definitions are satisfied. In the context of Pakistanis engaged in organized 
beggary abroad, if it is established that individuals are managed by 
groups that exercise control over their earnings, impose financial 
dependency, or restrict their autonomy to generate profit, such cases can 
meet the trafficking threshold under the PTPA.  
31. 
 
Section 8 of the PTPA provides that the police shall 
investigate offences under this Act. However, if the offence involves the 
transportation of a victim into or out of Pakistan and this transportation 
constitutes a part of the transaction constituting the offence, the Federal 
Investigation Agency (FIA) shall investigate the matter.10 Rule 12 of the 
PTP Rules requires that all investigative actions under the Act follow a 
victim-centered and human rights-based approach, ensuring full 
compliance with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. 
32. 
 
Rule 4 of the PTP Rules outlines the guiding principles for 
the identification of victims of human trafficking. The language and tenor  
of Rule 4 suggests that the list is non-exhaustive.11 Form 29.1, appended 
to the PTP Rules, provides a proforma for Early Risk Assessment of a 
Victim or Possible Victim of Trafficking in Persons.  
33. 
 
The “prevention” of trafficking offences is a core 
responsibility of law enforcement. Since the FIA is a police force,12 it is 
also vested with the powers outlined in section 54 Cr.P.C., which 
authorizes law enforcement officers to arrest a person (without a warrant) 
                                          
10 The Federal Government established the FIA Immigration Wing in 1975. According to the para-wise 
comments submitted by the Respondents, it handles more than 22 million passengers in traffic at its  
27 notified checkpoints/international borders. 
11 The United Nations provide a non-exhaustive list of indicators for identification of potential 
trafficking 
cases

https://sherloc.unodc.org/cld/zh/education/tertiary/tip-and-som/module-6/key-
issues/indicators-of-trafficking-in-persons.html.  Not all of the given indicators are present or obvious 
in every case. Equally, each of these indicators does not lead to a conclusion that a trafficking offence 
has been committed. It is a combination of indicators that will help to determine whether a person has 
been trafficked or not.

reasonably suspected of committing a cognizable offence or threatening 
public order or national security. These powers allow the FIA to take 
immediate action against individuals suspected of violating immigration 
laws or engaging in unlawful activities, such as human trafficking. 
However, the exercise of these powers is subject to legal safeguards to 
prevent misuse and ensure adherence to fundamental rights guaranteed by 
the Constitution. The FIA must justify arrests under section 54 Cr.P.C. 
based on reasonable suspicion supported by facts and must comply with 
procedural requirements, including producing the arrested person before a 
magistrate within 24 hours. 
34. 
 
It is important to point out that a trafficking victim is a 
competent witness against the handlers. Under section 6 of the PTPA, a 
victim is not criminally liable for an offence under this Act but may 
become a witness in the case. This provision recognizes that trafficking 
victims are typically coerced into illegal activities, meaning their actions 
lack the element of mens rea and are a product of compulsion rather than 
voluntary criminal intent. By granting victims immunity from 
prosecution, section 6 reinforces the legal principle that individuals forced 
to commit unlawful acts under duress should not face criminal 
consequences. This approach is also consistent with international norms, 
such as the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, which advocates for the non-criminalization of 
trafficking victims. By ensuring victims are treated as witnesses rather 
than offenders, this provision strengthens the ability to prosecute 
traffickers while safeguarding the rights of victims. 
35. 
 
Article 13(b) of the Constitution protects individuals from 
self-incrimination, stating that no one can be compelled to provide 
evidence against themselves. Section 6 of the PTPA aligns with the 
constitutional principle by ensuring that victims who may have been 
coerced into unlawful acts under conditions of exploitation are not 
prosecuted for those acts.  
36. 
 
The distinction between the Vagrancy Ordinance and the 
PTPA must be maintained to ensure the proper application of the law, as 
each statute addresses distinct aspects of criminal conduct. As 

Writ Petition No.12935/2024 
 
 
 
- 12 -
adumbrated, section 3 of the PTPA applies when coercion, fraud, or 
exploitation by a third party is involved, focusing on systematic 
exploitation and control over victims. In the absence of such elements, the 
Vagrancy Ordinance may apply to the situation. Conflating these laws 
risks mischaracterizing activities and undermining their intent and 
effectiveness. 
37. 
 
Section 3 PPC provides that any person liable under any 
Pakistani law for an offence committed beyond Pakistan “shall be dealt 
with according to the provisions of this Code for any act committed 
beyond Pakistan in the same manner as if such act had been committed 
within Pakistan.” This means that the PPC applies to define and punish 
such offences but also incorporates liability arising under any other 
Pakistani law. As discussed, under the PTPA, beggary alone does not fall 
within the scope of the law unless it involves elements meeting the legal 
threshold of trafficking as stipulated in section 3(1), such as coercion, 
fraud, or abuse of power. Therefore, even if the PTPA is not applicable, 
Pakistanis engaged in begging abroad, and their handlers can still be 
prosecuted under applicable Pakistani laws, such as the Vagrancy 
Ordinance, the Punjab Destitute and Neglected Children Act 2004, the 
Emigration Ordinance, 1979, or other relevant laws. Section 3 PPC 
ensures that such offences, regardless of where they are committed, are 
tried and punished as if they were committed within Pakistan, thereby 
maintaining accountability under the domestic legal framework. 
The case at hand 
38. 
 
Let us now examine the case at hand. I have outlined the 
details of the case earlier in this judgment. When the eight persons in 
question approached Respondent No.3 at Multan Airport for immigration 
clearance, their profiles raised suspicion due to irregularities such as 
insufficient financial resources (some carrying only 500 Riyals), 
unconfirmed return tickets, and mandatory hotel bookings. These facts, 
though indicative of potential misuse of visas, do not substantiate claims 
of compelled labour, debt bondage, or trafficking as required under 
sections 3 and 4 of the PTPA. They might align closely with offences

under the Vagrancy Ordinance, which addresses organized begging, but 
not the PTPA.

However, during baggage searches, authorities seized 900 
boxes of “Captain” brand cigarettes and 70 boxes of Velo nicotine 
pouches. According to the Investigating Officer, such items are 
commonly associated with individuals travelling to Saudi Arabia under 
the guise of pilgrimage and subsequently engaging in organized beggary. 
The information obtained during the interviews, combined with the 
search findings, prima facie, pointed to offences under sections 3 and 4 of 
the PTPA. Consequently, the passengers were offloaded, and FIR No. 
215/2024 was registered. In these circumstances, the registration of the 
FIR appears procedurally justified. Nevertheless, whether the case falls 
within the scope of the PTPA or the Vagrancy Ordinance requires further 
investigation and must be determined on the basis of evidence. The trial 
court will attend to this issue at the time of the framing of charge if the 
accused are challaned.  
40. 
 
The Investigating Officer has apprised that during the 
investigation, the FIA collected evidence that the Petitioners were 
habitually engaged in sending innocent people abroad under the pretense 
of Umrah visas and exploiting them for begging.  
41. 
 
The FIA has also booked the Petitioners under clause (b) of 
section 22 of the Emigration Ordinance, which stipulates that anyone 
who, for the purpose of providing, securing, or purporting to provide or 
secure employment for any person in a country outside Pakistan, without 
being authorized as a promoter, demands, receives, or attempts to receive 
any valuable consideration for themselves or others, shall be punishable 
with imprisonment for a term of up to fourteen years, a fine, or both.  
I have noted that when FIR No. 215/2024 was registered, there was no 
apparent justification for invoking this section. If, during the 
investigation, the Investigating Officer finds evidence of such an offence, 
he has the authority to incorporate it. Since the investigation is ongoing, 
I refrain from making further observations on this matter. The 
Investigating Officer is directed to consider this aspect when submitting

the report under section 173 Cr.P.C., and the trial court shall examine it 
when framing charges if the Petitioners are challaned. 
42. 
 
The Petitioners argue that the actions of Respondent No. 3 
violate their fundamental rights under Articles 15 and 20 of the 
Constitution, which protect freedom of movement and religion. While 
these rights are fundamental, they are not absolute and may be lawfully 
restricted under specific circumstances. International human rights law, 
particularly through instruments such as the ICCPR, recognizes these 
rights but also sets out permissible limitations to ensure public order, 
safety, health, and the protection of the rights of others. For example, the 
right to travel, whether domestically or internationally, can be restricted 
for reasons such as national security, public health concerns, or the 
requirements of criminal justice. Similarly, the right to practice one’s 
religion, while protected, may be limited when it poses risks to public 
safety, morality, or infringes on the rights of others, such as in situations 
where religious practices conflict with health regulations or affect the 
welfare of vulnerable populations. Such restrictions must be necessary, 
proportionate, and applied without discrimination to ensure they do not 
unduly infringe upon individual freedoms. In Pakistan Muslim League 
(N) 
and 
others 
v. 
Federation 
of 
Pakistan 
and 
others  
(PLD 2007 SC 642), the Supreme Court of Pakistan emphasized that 
while fundamental rights are essential for personal autonomy and dignity, 
they operate within a balanced framework to harmonize individual 
freedoms with broader societal needs. It stated: 
“The collective interests of the society, peace and security of the State 
and the maintenance of public order are of vital importance in any 
organized society. Fundamental Rights have no real meaning if the 
State itself is in danger and disorganized. If the State is in danger, the 
liberties of the subjects are themselves in danger. It is for these reasons 
that an equilibrium has to be maintained between the two contending 
interests at stake: one, the individual liberties and the positive rights of 
the citizen, which are declared by the Constitution to be fundamental, 
and the other, the need to impose social control and reasonable 
limitations on the enjoyment of those rights in the interest of the 
collective good of the society.” 
43. 
 
Pakistan has a comprehensive legal framework to regulate 
the entry and exit of individuals, including both citizens and foreigners, at

its borders.13 Standing Order No. 31/2005 was introduced to streamline 
the duties of immigration officers at the country’s international airports 
and provide clear job descriptions for their roles. This Standing Order 
empowers the Special Checking Officer to scrutinize passengers whose 
profiles appear inconsistent with their stated purpose of travel. By 
formalizing procedures, the framework aims to prevent arbitrary actions 
by immigration staff and protect passengers from unnecessary 
harassment.  
44. 
 
In the context of human trafficking, the FIA must adhere to 
the PTP Rules. Recently, the FIA Risk Analysis Unit developed a 
standardized set of interview questions to assist immigration staff in 
identifying individuals suspected of travelling abroad for organized 
beggary. These questions were officially circulated through Letter No. 
FIA/IMMGN/RAU/2024/3010 dated 5.8.2024. This initiative serves a 
dual purpose: it aids in preventing individuals involved in such activities 
from leaving the country while also ensuring that immigration officers 
conduct screenings in a fair and non-arbitrary manner. It safeguards the 
rights of travellers, shields them from undue harassment, and fosters 
transparency and accountability in immigration processes. 
45. 
 
In the present case, as discussed, Respondent No.3 was 
justified in offloading the eight passengers. His action aimed to protect the 
public interest and ensure compliance with international obligations. 
46. 
 
The Supreme Court has consistently held that the High Court 
should not interrupt or divert the ordinary course of criminal procedure as 
prescribed by the procedural statute by invoking Article 199 of the 
Constitution or section 561-A Cr.P.C. The grounds ordinarily considered 
for quashing an FIR are: (a) a jurisdictional defect evident on record,  
(b) a patent violation of some provision of law, or (c) the allegations 
contained in the FIR do not constitute an offence. In Bashir Ahmad v. 
Zafar-ul-Islam (PLD 2004 SC 298), the Supreme Court underscored that 
determining the guilt or innocence of an accused person is a rigorous 
judicial process. This process begins with a pre-trial evaluation by a

1981, The Exit from Pakistan (Control) Rules 2010, and various Standing Orders.

competent magistrate and proceeds through a detailed inquiry during the 
trial, where both the prosecution and defence are afforded comprehensive 
rights to present and challenge evidence. The Court cautioned against 
invoking section 561-A Cr.P.C. to prematurely decide criminal cases, as 
such a deviation risks undermining the purpose of a fair trial. It held that 
extraordinary circumstances must exist to justify departing from the 
prescribed procedural path. 
47. 
 
In A. Habib Ahmed v. M. K. G. Scott Christian  
(PLD 1992 SC 353), the Supreme Court reaffirmed that justice demands a 
proper inquiry and trial if an offence appears to have been committed. It 
clarified that the inherent jurisdiction under section 561-A Cr.P.C. is not 
an alternative remedy but must be exercised sparingly and only when no 
other legal recourse is available. This principle was emphasized in  
Col. Shah Sadiq v. Muhammad Ashiq (2006 SCMR 276) and  
Dr. Ghulam Mustafa v. The State (2008 SCMR 76), where the Supreme 
Court held that the High Court should not short-circuit the trial process 
using constitutional or inherent powers except in extraordinary situations. 
It warned that premature intervention undermines the balance between 
judicial and investigative functions, potentially disrupting the due process 
of law. 
48. 
 
In Ajmeel Khan v. Abdur Rahim (PLD 2009 SC 102), the 
Supreme Court highlighted that quashing an FIR during the investigation 
stage disrupts statutory police duties under sections 154 and 156 Cr.P.C. 
The Court reiterated that while the High Court may quash an FIR in cases 
of clear abuse of the legal process, it should avoid interfering with 
ongoing investigations or substituting its judgment for the investigative 
authorities. Such interference risks derailing the procedural integrity of 
the criminal justice system and undermining the principle of a fair and 
impartial trial. 
49. 
 
In 
The 
State 
v. 
Chaudhry 
Muhammad 
Khan  
(Civil Petition Nos. 671-L & 672-L of 2017, decided on 27.9.2024), the 
Supreme Court held that the exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction to 
quash an FIR under Article 199 is permissible only in cases where the 
facts on record unequivocally demonstrate that no offence can be

established against the accused, or where the registration of the FIR 
reflects a misuse of legal authority or lacks sound legal justification. 
Allowing the prosecution to continue in such circumstances would 
constitute an abuse of the legal process, warranting the quashing of the 
FIR. Cases registered without proper authority or in clear violation of 
established laws must also be quashed to uphold the integrity of the 
judicial system. However, the Court emphasized that this jurisdiction 
should not be invoked if the allegations in the FIR establish a prima facie 
case against the accused. 
50. 
 
Considering the case law discussed and the facts and 
circumstances of the case, there are no grounds for quashing the FIR. 
Hence, this petition is dismissed.
