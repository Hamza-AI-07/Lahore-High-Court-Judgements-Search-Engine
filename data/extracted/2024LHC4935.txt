Petitioner by: 
M/s Imran Muhammad Sarwar and Rana

Mr. Salman Riaz Chaudhry, Advocate (in 
connected petition i.e. W.P. No.17464 of 2022).   
Respondents by:

MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.: This 
consolidated judgment shall dispose of instant writ petition along 
with connected writ petition i.e. W.P. No.17464 of 2022 as common 
questions of law and facts are involved in these cases: 
2. 
Through these petitions, petitioners have assailed vires of 
orders dated 31.01.2014 & 11.02.2022, passed by respondents No.3 
& 2, respectively, whereby major penalty of “dismissal from 
service” was imposed upon the petitioners on account of gross 
misconduct and corruption and pursuant to order dated 14.10.2021, 
passed by this Court in previous round of litigation i.e. W.P. 
No.10794 of 2020 & W.P. No.40551 of 2020, petitioners’ appeals in 
this regard were rejected. Petitioners have also sought their 
reinstatement into service with all back benefits, however, since 
petitioner Muslim Gull (of connected petition) has reached the age 
of superannuation, therefore, he has also prayed for grant of 
pensionary benefits and monthly pension.  
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioners submits that in previous round 
of litigation, petitioners’ constitutional petitions calling in question 
the orders for their dismissal from service were allowed vide order 

2 
Writ Petition No.14605 of 2022 & connected case 
dated 14.10.2021 with a direction to the Appellate Authority / 
respondent No.2 to decide the appeals afresh, however, appeals of 
petitioners have once again been dismissed without taking into 
account the contentions of the petitioners. He adds that the decision 
in any event is in violation of Section 13 of the Punjab Employees 
Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act (“PEEDA Act”), 
2006 as the respondent-Appellate Authority had no authority to 
deviate from the recommendations made by the Inquiry Officer. He 
states that impugned appellate order being ultra vires the applicable 
law, is unsustainable.  
4. 
Conversely, learned Legal Advisor for respondent-LDA 
defends the impugned orders.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
Record indicates that major penalty of “dismissal from 
service” was imposed on petitioners due to allegations of their 
involvement in misplacement of file No.JT/AP/35, which was 
allegedly created to take illegal benefit and usurp valuable land 
belonging to LDA by one Mr. Muhammad Ashiq s/o Muhammad 
Ismail in connivance with the petitioners and other staff of LDA. As 
a result of inquiry proceedings, penalty of “stoppage of two 
increments for two years’ was initially recommended for petitioner 
Muslim Gull, however, the competent authority decided to initiate a 
de novo inquiry. Consequently, the Inquiry Officer recommended 
major penalty of forfeiture of 03-years of past service. The 
Competent Authority / respondent No.3 issued show cause notice to 
petitioner under Section 13(4) of the PEEDA Act, 2006 wherein it 
was specifically observed that the Competent Authority agreed with 
the findings of the Inquiry Officer and this notice did not reflect that 
the 
Competent 
Authority 
was 
intending 
to 
enhance 
the 
recommended punishment.  Ultimately, vide order dated 31.01.2014, 
major penalty of “dismissal from service” was imposed by simply 
observing that a blatant attempt of fraud was made by the petitioners 
by preparing forged, fabricated & fictitious file to gain illegal benefit 

3 
Writ Petition No.14605 of 2022 & connected case 
and usurp the valuable land belonging to LDA, however, in the same 
order, it has also been acknowledged that the plots in question were 
cancelled and no financial loss had occurred to the authority. The 
relevant portion of aforesaid order is reproduced hereunder:- 
“6. 
….. 
 
The 
aforementioned 
facts 
make 
the 
involvement of both the accused evident in this scam 
and none of them can be absolved from the charges. 
Moreover, the reply of Mr. Zahid Atta signifies his 
malafide intentions and his stance is quite 
astonishing that the regular inquiry proceedings were 
never held. He has also submitted that he has not 
been given opportunity by the Inquiry Officer to 
submit his stance and defend himself, on the 
contrary, two regular inquiries are conducted in this 
matter and Mr. Zahid Atta was part of both inquiry 
proceedings and was crossed examined in detail so 
his objections are just frivolous and are reflective of 
his ulterior motives. Both the officials have a 
reputation of being corrupt and are found involved in 
many other cases of corruption. Although the plots 
were cancelled and no financial loss occurred to the 
authority but there is no doubt left that a blatant 
attempt of fraud was made by the accused officials 
by preparing forged, fabricated & fictitious file 
No.JT/AP/35 and its subsequent part files to take 
illegal benefit and usurp the precious land of LDA in 
shape of 15 valuable plots. Thus, the accused are 
guilty of gross misconduct and corruption. Such an 
act calls for imposition of harshest of penalties upon 
both of them.” 
[emphasis supplied] 
There is no cavil to the proposition that the competent authority is 
not bound by the recommendations of Inquiry Officer qua the award 
of penalty to the accused officer / official. However, if the 
competent authority intends to deviate from those recommendations, 
it must adhere to certain procedural safeguards. Firstly, the 
competent authority is required to give mandatory notice to the 
accused officer / official qua enhancement in punishment 
recommended by the Inquiry Officer affording him an opportunity to 
defend his position and to plead his case against enhancement of 
penalty; and secondly, the competent authority has to pass a 
reasoned order for disagreeing with the recommendations of the 

4 
Writ Petition No.14605 of 2022 & connected case 
Inquiry Officer demonstrating a conscious application of mind, but 
needful was not done in this case. Reference is made to Director 
Postal Life Insurance, Lahore v. Shakeel Ahmad (2021 SCMR 
1162). 
7. 
It transpires from the available record that the Competent 
Authority has in fact agreed with the recommendation and reiterated 
it in the show cause-cum-personal hearing notice dated 20.01.2014, 
relevant part whereof is reproduced hereunder:- 
“3. 
AND WHEREAS, after perusal of the inquiry 
report and other relevant record, I have found no 
reason to differ with the findings of the Inquiry 
Officer. Hence, the charge of inefficiency, misconduct 
& corruption is proved against you for which you are 
liable to be imposed the penalty in terms of Section 4 
of the Act ibid.”  
Even there is no specific reference to the evidence or material, 
which urged respondent No.3 to award major penalty of “dismissal 
from service”. Thus, the said major penalty does not appear to be in 
conformity with law. Reference can be made to Shibli Farooqui v. 
Federation of Pakistan (2009 SCMR 281), Secretary, Government 
of Punjab and others v. Khalid Hussain Hamdani and 2 others 
(2013 SCMR 187), Asif Yousaf v. Secretary Revenue Division, CBR 
Islamabad and another (2014 SCMR 147) and Director Postal Life 
Insurance, Lahore v. Shakeel Ahmad (2021 SCMR 1162).  
8. 
Needless to say that the imposition of punishment under the 
law is primarily the function and prerogative of the competent 
authority and the role of the Court is secondary, which comes into 
play only when the imposed penalty is found to be unlawful or 
unreasonable. Reasonableness for the purposes of assessing the 
quantum or nature of a penalty imposed by the department is to be 
gauged by applying the test of proportionality. In the case 
reported as Sabir Iqbal v. Cantonment Board, Peshawar through 
Executive Officer and others (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 189), it 
was held that proportionality is a standard that examines the 
relationship between the objective the executive branch wishes to 

5 
Writ Petition No.14605 of 2022 & connected case 
achieve, which has the potential of infringing upon a human right, 
and the means it has chosen in order to achieve that infringing 
objective. It was also observed that a more sophisticated version 
of proportionality provided for a structured test, whereby it will 
firstly be assessed whether the measure taken is suitable in 
attaining the identified ends (the test of suitability, which includes 
the notion of "rational connection" between the means and ends) 
and then whether the measure is necessary or if a less restrictive 
or onerous method could have been adopted (the test of necessity). 
In essence, an administrative decision must not be more drastic 
than necessary and therefore, it follows that the penalty imposed 
must be commensurate with the misconduct or inefficiency that 
has 
been 
proved. 
Reliance 
is 
placed 
upon 
Divisional 
Superintendent, Postal Services, D.G. Khan v. Nadeem Raza and 
another (2023 SCMR 803), Pervaiz Hussain Shah and others v. 
Secretary to Government of Punjab Food Department Lahore and 
another (2024 SCMR 309) and Postmaster General Balochistan 
v. Amanat Ali and others (2024 SCMR 1484).  
9. 
In view of the above, these petitions are allowed in the 
manner that impugned orders dated 31.01.2014 & 11.02.2022 are 
declared to be illegal and without lawful authority. However, the 
Competent Authority may proceed afresh after issuance of fresh 
show cause notice for enhancement of punishment, thereby referring 
evidence ignored by the Inquiry Officer and providing reasons for 
disagreeing with the recommendations of the Inquiry Officer with 
conscious application of mind, keeping in view the dictum of law 
laid down in the case law, cited supra.
