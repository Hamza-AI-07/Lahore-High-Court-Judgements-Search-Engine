another‟ (No. 52/2011) dated 31.10.1998 claiming that she is 
actual owner of house measuring 3 marla, No. 4/230 
(previously 4/237), Muhallah Qilla Shah, Gujrat as further 
described in the suit (the ‘suit property’); that she purchased 
the suit property for Rs. 9,000/- in the name of her real son 
Muhammad Afzal as benamidar through sale deed No. 2430 
dated 23.05.1979, who has stolen the title documents and 
managed to sell the suit property to Abdul Wahid Nasim son 
of Abdul Wahab through sale deed No. 3414 dated 19.10.1998. 
Mst. Khursheed Begum prayed to annul the said deeds being 
ineffective to her rights in the suit property. As consequential 
relief she requested restraining the defendants of suit from 
interfering in her possession over the suit property. 
Muhammad Afzal filed written statement substantially 
conceding the averments in the plaint. Abdul Wahid Nasim 
filed contesting written statement and also filed suit titled 
„Abdul Wahid Nasim vs. Muhammad Afzal and another‟ (No. 
53/2011) dated 18.07.2000 seeking possession of the suit 
property on the strength of deed No. 3414 dated 19.10.1998.

4. 
Substantial steps towards the progress and 
completion of trial were taken in the above two suits before the 
learned trial Court when Muhammad Afzal, after about 12 
years of the above suits, filed third suit titled „Muhammad 
Afzal vs. Province of Punjab and another‟ (No. 416/2010) 
dated 07.01.2010, somehow, seeking declaration in his favour 
vis-à-vis the suit property and claiming cancellation of deed 
No. 3414 dated 19.10.1998. Facing this new situation and the 
third suit, Abdul Wahid Nasim filed written statement, 
resulting into framing of following issues in this suit: - 
1. Whether plaintiff is entitled to a decree 
for declaration of his title over the suit 
property along with consequential relief 
for cancellation of sale deed NO.3414 
dated 19.10.1998 as prayed for? OPP

In the third suit Muhammad Afzal himself 
appeared as PW-2 and produced one Malik Muhammad Daud

C.R. No. 663 of 2014

as PW-1. Exh.P-1 was brought on the record as documentary 
evidence. On the other hand, Abdul Wahid Nasim appeared as 
DW-1 and Exh.D-1 to Exh.D-7 were brought on the record as 
documentary evidence. 
6. 
On 29.07.2011, in the suit instituted by Mst. 
Khursheed Begum (No. 52/2011 dated 31.10.1998) and the 
suit of Abdul Wahid Nasim (No. 53/2011 dated 18.07.2000), 
the learned trial Court gave consolidated judgment and decree, 
and after giving issue-wise findings, reached to the following 
conclusion: - 
 
“Resume of the above discussion is 
that the plaintiff has failed to prove her 
claim of ownership over the disputed house, 
therefore, her suit for declaration is 
dismissed while suit of defendant NO. 2 for 
possession 
stands 
proved 
therefore, 
decreed in his favour against the plaintiff 
and the defendant NO. 1. The plaintiff and 
defendant NO. 1 are directed to vacate the 
house within one month of this order. 
Parties are left to bear their own costs. 
Copy of this consolidated judgment be 
placed on the record of suit file titled 
“Abdul Wahad Vs. Muhammad Afzal & 
Khurshid Begum”(suit for possession of 
house). File be consigned to record room 
after its due completion.” 
 
 
The suit of Mst. Khursheed Begum (No. 52/2011) 
was dismissed and suit of Abdul Wahid Nasim (No. 53/2011) 
was decreed in his favour. On the same day through separate 
judgment and decree suit of Muhammad Afzal (No. 416/2010) 
was dismissed.  
7. 
Mother and son (Mst. Khursheed Begum and 
Muhammad Afzal) instituted appeals. Appeal No. 02/2011 was 
filed by Mst. Khursheed Begum against judgment and decree 
dated 29.07.2011 passed in first two suits. Appeal No. 03/2011 
was filed by Muhammad Afzal against the judgment and 

 
R.S.A. No. 43 of  2014 
C.R. No. 663 of 2014           
 
 
6 
decree dated 29.07.2011 in the third suit titled „Muhammad 
Afzal vs. Province of Punjab and another‟ (No. 416/2010).  
8. 
The learned first Appellate Court found no 
mistake in the judgments of the learned trial Court and vide 
separate judgments and decrees (both dated 11.02.2014) 
dismissed the appeals. Aggrieved from the same, Mst. 
Khursheed Begum has filed the captioned regular second 
appeal and Muhammad Afzal has filed civil revision No. 663 
of 2014.   
 
9.  
Sheikh Usman Karim-ud-Din learned ASC, on 
behalf of Mst. Khursheed Begum, has submitted that original 
title deed was stolen by Muhammad Afzal and handed over the 
same to Abdul Wahid Nasim; that Muhammad Afzal was drug 
addict, who was lured to do the said act. He relied on utility 
bills in the name of Mst. Khursheed Begum that are on record 
as Exh.P-3 to Exh.P-5. Sheikh Usman Karim-ud-Din-learned 
ASC, has explained that Muhammad Afzal was minor, having 
no source of income at the given time and out of love the 
mother / Mst. Khursheed Begum purchased the suit property in 
his name. He has further submitted that Abdul Wahid Nasim 
has failed to prove the consideration, allegedly paid to 
purchase the suit property.  
 
10. 
Ms. Safina Safdar Bhatti, learned Advocate on 
behalf of Muhammad Afzal, has contended that upon denial of 
execution, Abdul Wahid Nasim being beneficiary of deed No. 
3414 dated 19.10.1998 was required to prove the execution of 
the deed but he miserably failed to do the same; that articles 17 
and 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 have been 
adhered; that the transaction lacks consideration; that no one 
from registrar’s office was produced. She has further submitted 
that Muhammad Afzal was addicted to alcohol and Mst. 
Khursheed Begum was subjected to fraud. In course of 

 
R.S.A. No. 43 of  2014 
C.R. No. 663 of 2014           
 
 
7 
arguments she has relied upon cases titled “Jan Baz and 10 
others vs. Shah Nawaz and 2 others” (2017 YLR Note 215), 
“Abdul Qadeer vs. Ashiq Ali and 2 others” (2006 YLR 2900), 
“Jhanda and 3 others vs. Maulvi Mukhtar Ahmad and 
another” (2007 YLR 2493) and “Muhammad Qasim vs. Wazir 
through L.Rs” (2007 MLD 1086).  
11.  
Conversely, Malik Ghulam-us-Syeddain, learned 
Advocate for respondent No. 1, has submitted that rival party 
adopted stance that Muhammad Afzal was minor at the time of 
registration of deed No. 2430 dated 23.05.1979 (Exh.P-2), 
however, their falsehood is evident from school certificate and 
Family Form-B where his age is recoded differently and these 
documents clearly suggest that in year 1979 he was more than 
18 years old; that the entire evidence led by other side is full of 
contradictions; that Mst. Khursheed Begum never purchased 
the suit property from her own sources; that the necessary 
elements to obtain decree of declaration on the basis of benami 
are missing. To the extent of suit of Muhammad Afzal (No. 
416/2010), it is submitted that this suit is badly time barred. In 
course of arguments Malik Ghulam-us-Syeddain-learned 
Advocate has relied upon cases titled as “Dr. Muhammad 
Javaid Shafi vs. Syed Rashid Arshad and others” (PLD 2015 
Supreme Court 212), “Nasrullah Khan and another vs. Mst. 
Khairunnisa and others” (2020 SCMR 2101), “Pir Bux and 
others vs. Ghulam Rasool and others” (NLR 1997 Civil 468), 
“Muhammad Nawaz Minhas and others vs Mst. Surriya Sabir 
Minhas and others” (2009 SCMR 124) and “Hameeda Begum 
vs. Farzand Ali” (2002 YLR 1311). 
12. 
Rana Sher Zaman Akram, learned Assistant 
Advocate General, has submitted that frivolous allegations 
have been levelled against Government officials but no proof 
to substantiate such allegations could be given by Mst. 

 
R.S.A. No. 43 of  2014 
C.R. No. 663 of 2014

Khursheed Begum and Muhammad Afzal during the trial. It is 
added that presumption of correctness is attached to sale deeds 
in question which were registered by the concerned officials in 
course of their duties, who otherwise have no interest in the 
transactions.  
13. 
I have heard the arguments of the learned counsel 
for the parties and perused the record with their able 
assistance. 
14. 
In order to prove ‘motive’, which is one of the 
most important elements to establish benami transaction, no 
special reason is set-up in the plaint or brought on record as 
evidence, to hold or purchase the property in the name of 
Muhammad Afzal, besides claiming that Muhammad Afzal 
was drug addict. Skeleton arguments have been submitted by 
Sheikh Usman Karim-ud-Din-learned ASC, in which reason of 
benami is stated as love and affection of Mst. Khursheed 
Begum for her son, Muhammad Afzal. Learned counsel argued 
that the suit property was purchased in the name of 
Muhammad Afzal temporarily, whereas, reading of evidence 
given by Mst. Khursheed Begum leads to strong inference that 
the suit property was purchased in the name of Muhammad 
Afzal with positive application of mind for his welfare and to 
be held by him for good. Mst. Khursheed Begum failed to 
prove that the suit property was in the name of Muhammad 
Afzal provisionally or for some particular reason. In this regard 
the following guidance in case titled “Ghulam Murtaza vs. 
Mst. Asia Bibi and others” (PLD 2010 Supreme Court 569), 
is relevant:- 
 
“…A transaction cannot be dubbed 
as benami simply because one person 
happened to make payment for or on behalf 
of the other. We come across innumerable 
transactions where a father purchases 
property with his own sources for his minor 

 
R.S.A. No. 43 of  2014 
C.R. No. 663 of 2014           
 
 
9 
son or daughter keeping in mind that the 
property shall vest in the minor. Such 
transaction 
subsequently 
cannot 
be 
challenged by father as benami simply 
because the amount was paid by him. There 
are people who, with positive application of 
mind, purchase properties in the name of 
others with intention that the title shall vest 
in that other. 
8.  
As said earlier, there are certain 
transactions in peculiar circumstances of 
those peculiar cases where, for reason of 
certain emergencies or contingencies, the 
properties are purchased in the name of 
some other person without the intention 
that the title shall so vest permanently. If 
such motive is available and also is 
reasonable and plausible, a transaction can 
be held as benami, otherwise not. A 
property purchased with ones own sources 
in the name of some close relative like wife, 
son or daughter cannot be dubbed as 
benami when purchased with full intention 
of conferring title to the purchaser shown. 
If this principle is denied and that of 
benami attracted simply because the 
sources of consideration could not be 
proved in favour of the named vendee, it 
would shatter the most honest and bona 
fide transactions thereby bringing no end to 
litigation…” 
 
 
 
(Underlining is added) 
 
15. 
Somehow to prove that at the material time 
Muhammad Afzal was not earning anything different stances, 
which are contradictory to documentary evidence, have been 
adopted. Mst. Khursheed Begum tried to establish that 
Muhammad Afzal was minor at the time of the transaction / 
sale deed No. 2430. Mst. Khursheed Begum, when appeared as 
PW-1, in her examination-in-chief stated that Muhammad 
Afzal at the time of registration of deed No. 2430 dated 
23.05.1979 was about 14 to 15 years old. In her cross-
examination she remained reluctant to tell the year of birth of 

 
R.S.A. No. 43 of  2014 
C.R. No. 663 of 2014           
 
 
10 
her own son. It is appropriate to reproduce following extracts 
from her examination:-.

It is not possible that a mother cannot recall even 
tentatively the year when her son was born. Even the illiterate 
or simplistic people used to relate years of births of their dears 
with some events to recall the same. The above reproduced 
statement of Mst. Khursheed Begum is further belied by school 
certificate (Exh.P-6) and Family-Form B (Exh.P-7) where date 
of birth of Muhammad Afzal is recorded as 25.11.1960. No 
explanation could be given as to this inconsistency.  
16. 
Mst. Khursheed Begum and Muhammad Afzal 
were well aware that producing title document in evidence is 
an important factor. They, therefore, adopted stance that 
Muhammad Afzal was drug addict. Mother deposed that 
Muhammad Afzal was trapped. Muhammad Afzal deposed 
that to steal the title document he was paid Rs. 2,000/- and then 
Rs. 3,000/-. He stated that after theft he was paid Rs. 7,000/- 
further. However, no criminal prosecution was lodged against 
Abdul Wahid Nasim. Mst. Khursheed Begum failed to depose 
or plead the date of theft; the place where she kept the 
documents or from where the deed was stolen. I asked 
questions to Sheikh Usman Karim-ud-Din, learned Advocate 
as to above aspects but he also avoided to answer the said 
questions and tried to take the case in other and irrelevant 
directions.   
 

 
R.S.A. No. 43 of  2014 
C.R. No. 663 of 2014           
 
 
11 
17. 
Mst. Khursheed Begum admitted in her cross-
examination that her husband was working abroad from where 
he used to send money. She admitted that she never remained 
in any employment or worked for earnings. To demonstrate 
source of purchase, she claimed that the suit property was 
partly purchased from the sources of her husband and partly 
from sale of her jewelry but failed to state as to the amount she 
fetched through such sale or date of sale of jewelry or amount 
that she contributed towards the purchase of the suit property. 
It is also apparent from record that main source of payment of 
sale consideration was the amounts sent by the father of 
Muhammad Afzal when he was working abroad. Mst. 
Khursheed Begum admitted in her cross-examination, which 
took place in the year 2002 / 2003, that father died 17 / 18 
years ago. This means that father lived for considerable time 
after deed No. 2430 dated 23.05.1979 but he never claimed 
Muhammad Afzal as benamidar. 
18. 
The learned trial Court reached to the conclusion 
that the case set-up by Mst. Khursheed Begum is nothing more 
than a pack of lies. The learned first Appellate Court found that 
the mother and son, in league with each other, are misleading 
the Courts. I have gone through record very minutely and my 
conclusion is not different. The evidence of Mst. Khursheed 
Begum is based on inconsistent statements. Mother and son 
both kept developing their case. Dents in the statements of the 
witnesses of mother were unsuccessfully attempted to be 
repaired by cross-examination conducted by son’s lawyer. The 
case set-up by them is highly unbelievable. The elements to 
establish benami transaction could not be proved with required 
level of cogency.  
19. 
Being aware of above all, Muhammad Afzal went 
on to file suit titled „Muhammad Afzal vs. Province of Punjab 

 
R.S.A. No. 43 of  2014 
C.R. No. 663 of 2014           
 
 
12 
and another‟(No. 416/2010), after 12 years of her mother’s 
suit, to deprive Abdul Wahid Nasim from the possession of the 
suit property. Muhammad Afzal jumped from one stance to 
another. His statement as witness in one suit manifestly 
contradicts his statement in another as to same set of facts and 
transactions. In the latter suit he deviated from his support to 
his mother as to plea of benami. The stances in the pleadings 
and evidence of first two suits are in many-fold varying from 
the stance(s) in suit filed by Muhammad Afzal. It appears that 
in order to maintain possession over the suit property they 
were not reluctant even to mislead the Courts and they 
remained successful in this design for 25 years. The miseries 
of execution are yet to start. The witnesses of Mst. Khursheed 
Begum and Muhammad Afzal are found highly untruthful. 
They, by jumping from one stance to another and by giving 
implausible as well as self-contradictory statements, lost 
credibility and on the basis of such evidence any finding in 
their favour would have been unsafe. Reference can be made 
to cases titled “Muhammad Ghaffar (deceased) through LRs 
and others vs. Arif Muhammad” (PLJ 2023 SC 255), “Mst. 
Zaitoon Begum vs. Nazar Hussain and another” (2014 SCMR 
1469) and “Ghafoor Khan (deceased) through LRs. vs. Israr 
Ahmed” (2011 SCMR 1545). It will be beneficial to reproduce 
para 14 of “Mst. Zaitoon Begum” case (supra), which reads as 
follows:-   
“…14. True that the law since long, 
developed by the Superior Courts, provides 
maximum protection to illiterate ladies, to 
ensure that no one could practice fraud 
upon them and to deprive them of valuable 
property rights. However, under the garb 
of that protection or privilege, such ladies 
could not be given free licence to tell lie, 
by misusing such privilege or protection, 
allowed to them under the law. It is well 
embedded principle of law that “one who 

 
R.S.A. No. 43 of  2014 
C.R. No. 663 of 2014           
 
 
13 
makes statements, mutually inconsistent 
statements in the same matter, at two 
occasions, with regard to the same issue, is 
not entitled to be listened to”. because the 
credibility of the person, giving testimony 
on oath, is shaken to a great extent, once 
she is found indulging in jumping from 
one stance and catching on another 
stance, such eventuality would give rise to 
strong presumption that under the garb of 
protection given to illiterate lady, she is 
herself indulging in misrepresentation and 
attempting to mislead the Court to reach at 
a patently wrong conclusion. In any case, 
Courts are required to deal with each 
individual case according to facts and 
circumstances 
and 
evidence 
adduced 
therein and in no manner, to widen the 
scope of the protection/privilege, given to 
illiterate ladies in the matter of such 
transaction…” 
 
 
 
      (Emphasis supplied) 
 
The decisions of the learned two Courts below, in 
the first two suits (Khursheed Begum vs. Muhammad Afzal & 
another and Abdul Wahid Nasim vs. Muhammad Afzal and 
another), are not found against any law or usage having force 
of law or defective in any manner, which is essential to 
successfully maintain a regular second appeal, under section 
100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. 
20. 
The suit titled „Muhammad Afzal vs. Province of 
Punjab and another‟ (No. 416/2010) was instituted by 
Muhammad Afzal on 07.01.2010 to seek declaration against 
agreements and deed pertaining to the year 1998. In paragraph 
No. 6 of the suit, it is asserted that the cause accrued in his 
favour on 19.10.1998 and then lastly few days before filing the 
suit. He failed to mention in the pleadings or establish in 
evidence as to how this last cause accrued in his favour, as 
stated in the said paragraph. The limitation for such suits is 
provided in Article 120 of the first schedule of Limitation Act,

C.R. No. 663 of 2014

1908 (the ‘Limitation Act’), which reads as follows:- 
120 
Suit for which no period 
of limitation is provided 
elsewhere 
in 
this 
schedule. 
Six 
years 
When the right to 
sue accrues. 
 
 
The time under above article of the Limitation Act 
runs from the date when the ‘right to sue’ accrues. The words 
‘right to sue’ means that when a person has ‘right to seek 
relief’ under the relevant law. In cases titled “Saadat Khan and 
others vs. Shahid-Ur-Rehman and others” (PLD 2023 
Supreme Court 362) and “Mst. Rabia Gula and others vs. 
Muhammad Janan and others” (2022 SCMR 1009) the 
provision of Article 120 of the Limitation Act and section 42 of 
the Specific Relief Act, 1877 are analyzed / dealt in detail and 
it has been concluded that right to sue accrues to a person 
against the other for declaration of right vis-à-vis a property 
when latter actually denies rights or when he is interested to 
deny in the sense of threat of denial. The denial when actual it 
obligates the claimant to bring action, within the period of 
limitation given in the Limitation Act. When alleged 
wrongdoer or the one denying the right has done something 
explicitly to deny the rights by doing overt act that amounts to 
actual denial for which if the claimant has gained definite 
knowledge, then plea of threat of denial, cannot revive 
limitation. In cases of mere threat of denial, each threatened 
denial gives rise to fresh cause.  It is settled that when right to 
sue arises largely depends upon the circumstances of each 
case. Here I would like to reproduce para 8.13 of “Mst. Rabia 
Gula and others” case (supra):-  
 
“…8.13 Now, what "actions" can be termed 
as an "actual denial of right", and what a mere 
"apprehended or threatened denial of right", in 
the context of adverse entries recorded in the 

 
R.S.A. No. 43 of  2014 
C.R. No. 663 of 2014

revenue record. It is important to note that a 
person 
may 
ignore 
an 
"apprehended 
or 
threatened denial” of his right taking it not too 
serious to dispel that by seeking a declaration of 
his right through instituting a suit, and may 
exercise his option to institute the suit, when he 
feels it necessary to do so, to protect his right. For 
this reason, every “apprehended or  threatened 
denial” of right gives a fresh cause of action and 
right to sue to the person aggrieved of such 
apprehension or threat. However, this option to 
delay the filing of the suit is not available to him 
in case of “actual denial” of his right; where if 
he does not challenge the action of actual denial 
of his right, despite having knowledge thereof, by 
seeking declaration of his right within the 
limitation period provided in the Limitation Act, 
then his right to do so becomes barred by law of 
limitation…”

21.  
It is often observed that despite actual denials, 
giving rise to right to sue, the belated cases are filed on the 
basis of alleged threat of denial. Generally, at the ends of 
plaints in addition to the actual denial a sentence is added that 
‘the cause again accrued just few days ago‟. This is being 
done without pleading actual date of threatened denial or any 
prima facie proof thereof. In some of these cases, mostly the 
actual denials are through positive act(s) which are self-
evident, patent and manifest. The present case is classical 
example of such cases. The agreement and deed, in question, 
pertain to the year 1998, which were assailed in the year 1998 
by Mst. Khursheed Begum in suit titled „Khursheed Begum vs.

C.R. No. 663 of 2014

Muhammad Afzal and another‟ (No. 52/2011), in which 
Muhammad Afzal filed written statement in 1999 pleading that 
the relevant documents were signed by him and claiming that 
this was done under intoxication. The written statement and 
evidence of Abdul Wahid Nasim expressly denied the claimed 
rights. Muhammad Afzal appeared as DW-1 in the said suit 
(No. 52 / 2011) and repeatedly admitted having knowledge of 
acts and documents forming basis of his suit titled 
„Muhammad Afzal vs. Province of Punjab and another‟ (No. 
416/2010). Yet he filed this suit for declaration, which 
amounts to double version, attracting estoppel and the suit is 
fallacious on the face of it. He undeniably had knowledge from 
beginning of the complained acts and actual denial of his rights 
by Abdul Wahid Nasim. Ms. Safina Safdar Bhatti, learned 
Advocate, could not disagree this position either when she was 
arguing this case for Muhammad Afzal.  
22. 
Section 3 of the Limitation Act commands that 
subject to sections 4 to 25 every suit after the period of 
limitation prescribed in first schedule has to be dismissed 
irrespective of the fact if the limitation is set-up as a defence or 
not. Section 3 ibid imposes duty on the Courts themselves to 
look into the matter and when from the statement in the plaint 
it is undoubtful that the suit is time barred then to proceed to 
reject it. The Judge cannot on equitable grounds enlarge the 
time provided by the law. Where the question of law of 
limitation is not a mixed question of law and fact as well as the 
suit on the face of the record is hit by limitation and when it 
became apparent or undoubtful to the Court, it becomes 
incumbent on the Court, whether the limitation is pleaded or 
not by litigant, to discharge the duty to reject the case. In case 
titled “Hakim Muhammad Buta and another vs. Habib Ahmad 
and others” (PLD 1985 Supreme Court 153), a bench of

Honourable five members of Supreme Court of Pakistan 
settled the issues as follows:-. 
4.  
The words of section 3 of the 
Limitation Act are mandatory  in nature in 
that every suit instituted after the period of 
limitation shall, subject to the provision of 
sections 4 to 25 of that Act, be dismissed 
although limitation has not been set up as a 
defence. If from the statement in the plaint 
the suit appears to be barred by limitation, 
the plaint shall have to be rejected also 
under Order VII, rule 11, C. P. C. The law, 
therefore, does not leave the matter of 
limitation to the pleadings of the parties. It 
imposes a duty in this regard upon the 
Court itself. There is a chain of authority, 
and a detailed discussion of the same is 
not necessary, to lay down that limitation 
being a matter of statute and the 
provisions being mandatory, it cannot be 
waived and even if waived can be taken up 
by the party waiving it and by the Courts 
them-selves. In Sitharama v. Krishnaswami 
(I), where the defendants had pleaded the 
bar of limitation but the trial Court had 
held that they having admitted their liability 
for the amount in resisting the plaintiff's 
application in a previous suit, were 
estopped on general principles of law and 
equity from pleading that the suit was 
barred by limitation. It was ruled that the 
defendants were not estopped and it was 
observed that "the bar of limitation cannot 
be waived, and suits and other proceedings 
must be dismissed if brought after the 
prescribed period of limitation" and that 
"the Judge cannot, on equitable grounds, 
enlarge the time allowed by the law, 
postpone 
its 
operation, 
or 
introduce 
exceptions not recognised by it".

Not just the conduct of Muhammad Afzal is 
unconscionable, who maintained two different stances in two 
suits, disentitling him from equitable relief but at the same 
time his case is badly barred by limitation. Revision-petition of

Muhammad Afzal must, therefore, fail.   
 
23.  
 
For all that has been discussed above, the regular 
second appeal and the civil-revision being meritless are 
dismissed. No order as to costs.
