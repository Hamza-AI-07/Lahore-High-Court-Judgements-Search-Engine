13.07.2023. Mr. Ahmad Masood Gujjar, Advocate. 
 
Mr. Falak Sher Bakhsh Gill, AAG with Irshad Ahmad, 
Section Officer, Home Department and Zafar SHO. 
 
The appellant has filed the instant criminal appeal mainly against 
the order dated 18.10.2021, whereby his name was entered in the 4th 
schedule of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 (ATA, 1997) and the order dated 
20.09.2022, by which his review petition against the above order has 
been rejected. 
2. 
We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties 
and examined the record. 
3. 
Learned counsel submits that appellant’s case does not qualify to 
be treated under section 11-EE ATA, 1997 for his proscription because 
no such material is available against him. For ready reference relevant 
part of section 11-EE ATA, 1997 is reproduced as under:- 
“11EE. Proscription of Person. (1) The Federal Government may, by 
order published in the official Gazette, list a person as a proscribed person 
in the fourth Schedule on an ex-parte basis, if there are reasonable grounds 
to believe that such person is—  
(a) concerned in terrorism; 
(aa) listed under the United Nations (Security Council) Act, 1948 
(XIV of 1948)  
(b) an activist, office bearer on an associate of an organization kept 
under observation under section 11D or proscribed under section 
11B; and  
(c) in any way concerned or suspected to be concerned with such 
organization or affiliated with any group or organization suspected 
to be involved in terrorism or sectarianism or acting on behalf of, or 
at the direction of, any person or organization proscribed under this 
Act. 

 
Crl.A.No.67693/2022. 
2
Recitation of above section stands in confirmity to the stance raised by 
the learned counsel for the appellant, therefore, we are pursuaded to 
examine the material and criteria in place for proscription of nay 
person.  
4. 
The criteria or prerequisites for listing a person as a proscribed in 
the fourth schedule of ATA, 1997 are almost settled by the courts i.e. 
the State must demonstrate that the person sought to be notified as 
such, was involved in cases under Sections 6 and 7 of the ATA,1997 or 
was an office-bearer, activist or associate with an organization notified 
in terms of Section 11-B for proscription of organization by Federal 
Government or was member of such organization which was under 
observation in terms of Section 11-D of ATA, 1997 or was involved in 
terrorism or sectarianism. Further, in order to arrive at a conclusion on 
above aspects, the information may be gathered from any credible 
source whether domestic or foreign including governmental and 
regulatory authorities, the law enforcement agencies, financial 
intelligence units, banks and non-banking companies and even 
international institutions. The cases reported as “FARRUKH IMTIAZ 
KHOKHAR versus GOVERNMENT OF PAKITAN through Secretary 
Ministry of Interior, Islamabad and 2 others” (2021 MLD 40) and 
“MUHAMMAD ILYAS GHUMAN versus GOVERNMENT OF 
PUNJAB through Secretary Home Department Lahore and others” 
(PLD 2020 Lahore 378) are referred. But the foremost condition would 
always remain that above conclusion would be drawn on the basis of 
concrete/cogent material/grounds and justifiable reasons to establish 
that such person was an activist, office bearer or an associate of 
proscribed organization or an organization suspected to be involved in 
terrorism or sectarianism. “ZULFIQAR ALI GOHAR ALVI versus 
GOVERNMENT OF THE PUNJAB through Home Secretary, Lahore 
and 11 others” (2017 YLR Note 264). There must be some reasonable 
grounds before enlisting a person in 4th schedule and of course 
reasonable grounds stand apart from reasonable suspicion. This court 
has explained the statutory safeguards in this respect in a case reported 

 
Crl.A.No.67693/2022. 
3
as “Qari MUHAMMAD ARIF Versus SECRETARY HOME DEPARTMENT and 
others” (PLD 2021 Lahore 499).   
5. 
We are mindful of the consequences of enlisting a person in 4th 
schedule, which are enumerated through section 11-O of ATA, 1997, 
like as follow: - 
(a) 
the money or other property owned or controlled, wholly or partly, 
directly or indirectly, by a proscribed organization or proscribed 
person shall be frozen or seized, as the case may be;  
(b) 
the money or other property derived or generated from any property 
referred in clause (a) shall be frozen or seized, as the case may be; 
(c) 
no person shall use, transfer, convert, dispose of or remove such 
money or other property with effect from proscription; and 
(d) 
within forty-eight hours of any freeze or seizure, the person carrying 
out the freeze or seizure shall submit a report containing details of 
the property and the persons affected by the freeze or seizure to such 
office of the Federal Government as may be notified in the official 
Gazette. 
The property so frozen or seized shall remain as such until a 
proscription is cancelled as per section 11-U of Anti-Terrorism Act, 
1997. 
6.    Sanctions so reflected above apparently are against the 
fundamental rights but of course, as per command of the Constitution 
of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, fundamental rights are regulated 
subject to statutory law, therefore, when fundamental right is being 
abridged through statutory law, utmost care and caution should be 
exercised to evaluate the information/material against the delinquents. 
It must not be an exercise in vacuum or routinely venture based on 
whims, wishes or conjectures of the authority to move blindly and run 
over the guaranteed fundamental rights. It is in common experience that 
after imposition of such sanctions, person becomes handicapped to run 
his life honourably and smoothly; for subsistence and spending his life, 
he becomes dependent upon the discretion of the Federal Government, 
and he is to take refuge in this respect under section 11-OO of the Act, 
ibid. For ready reference the said section is reproduced here under: - 
“Access to services, money or other property. (1) The Federal 
Government may permit a person to make available to a proscribed 

 
Crl.A.No.67693/2022. 
4
organization or proscribed person such services, money or other 
property as may be prescribed, including such money as may be 
required for meeting necessary medical and educational expenses and 
for subsistence allowance, and such person shall not be liable for any 
offence under this Act on account of provision of the prescribed 
services, money or other property.”  
In addition to above, the person enlisted in 4th schedule is required to 
execute a bond for certain restriction upon his freedom of movement, 
right to reside at a particular place, deprivation from entertainment and 
amusement, curtailment of liberty including check and probe on their 
assets or assets of his family members including parents, being under 
constant monitoring or surveillance; so much so he can be arrested and 
detained u/s 11-EEE of ATA, 1997 as and when the government 
desires. In short, he is clutched so hard to live a peaceful life.  
Therefore, a strict criteria or stringent approach be adopted before 
enlisting a person in the 4th schedule, and the material collected against 
him should be appreciated keeping in view the above consequences.  
7.    Section 11-EE of ATA, 1997 though enumerates different 
situations attracting liability for the persons to be enlisted in 4th 
schedule but use of words “reasonable grounds” in the section requires 
to evaluate the material/information within that scope. The term 
‘reasonable grounds’ though is part of explanation attached to Section 
11-EE but it has not been defined in the Act, so in any ordinary sense it 
could be understood from the following expressions; 
“Reasonable grounds” means  
a set of facts or circumstances which would satisfy an ordinary 
cautious and prudent person that there is reason to believe and such 
belief goes beyond mere suspicion.  
a suspicion that is based on reasons which can be articulated. It is more 
than mere hunch or supposition, but much less than the level of proof 
that would be required to impose a disciplinary sanction. 
more than mere suspicion but less than the civil test of balance of 
probabilities. It is a much lower threshold than the standard known as 
“proof beyond reasonable doubt.” It is a bona fide belief in a serious 
possibility based on credible evidence.    
that there must be some supporting information for the suspicion. A 
mere allegation is not enough. Reports must not contain information 
that is known to be untrue.  

 
Crl.A.No.67693/2022. 
5
information that establishes sufficient articulable facts which give a 
trained law enforcement or criminal investigative agency officer, 
investigator, or employee a reasonable basis to believe that a definable 
criminal activity or enterprise is, has been, or may be committed.    
The reasonable grounds flow from the information available or 
collected against the delinquents and such information is usually 
derived from the links propagated through many types of material 
including SMS/Voice Messages, messages on WhatsApp or other 
social media accounts, pamphlets/handouts, posters, photographs, 
painting, caricatures, books/Literature, newspapers, Audio/Video CDs, 
electronic and digital material, wall chalking, banners/Pena flex, 
demonstrations in Rallies, material on Facebook, twitter or any other 
social media account, communication on Telephone/Mobile (CDR), 
speeches in Public Meetings, Radio & T.V. shows, surveillance report 
in any form, reports from international agencies, suspicious transaction 
report from any financial institution.  
8. 
What type of material could be considered as giving rise to 
reasonable grounds can well be understood from the designs and 
intentions of terrorists for preparation, facilitation, funding, instigation 
or commission of a terrorist act and has well been explained by 
Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as “GHULAM 
HUSSAIN and others Versus The STATE and others” (PLD 2020 Supreme 
Court 61); that “terrorism as an ’ism’ is totally a different concept 
which denotes commission of a crime with the design or purpose of 
destabilizing the government, disturbing the society or hurting a 
section of the society with a view to achieve objectives which are 
essentially political, ideological or religious.” All the persons who are 
involved in acts advancing a religious, sectarian or ethnic cause or 
promoting political destabilization could well be judged for enlisting in 
4th schedule if credible information in any of the forms cited above or 
evidence is available against them.      
                 The authority before enlisting any person in 4th schedule 
must ensure that information be available in more than one forms as 
highlighted above so as to make it credible and be more than a 
suspicion. It is expected that authority should maintain record 

 
Crl.A.No.67693/2022.

periodically for addition or deletion of any activities of the suspect 
during the period he is taken on 4th schedule so as to place it before the 
courts for proper assistance and decisions. It must be ensured that the 
person, once involved in such activities, is still alive and in touch with 
same state of affairs in order to avoid any deprivation of an individual 
from his fundamental rights whose dignity is to be respected which is 
inviolable right of a citizen as contemplated under Article 14 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.  
 
9. 
Coming back to the case, this court asked specific questions 
from the learned law officer whether he has any record with him which 
could establish links of the present appellant with any proscribed 
organization or he could show the Court any material like visuals or 
audio by which it could be seen or heard that appellant was engaged in 
any objectionable activities but no such material could be produced or 
shown to the Court. When asked to explain the reasons for placing 
appellant’s name in the 4th schedule of ATA, 1997, contended that 
appellant remained involved in one criminal case and learned law 
officer had also no information about the fate of such FIR. Even 
otherwise, simply the involvement of the appellant in any criminal case 
is hardly a ground to deprive any citizen of his fundamental right of life 
and liberty. Record once at the credit of an accused cannot be used to 
rotate him in such allegations again without any fresh material in this 
respect which is not available. 
10. 
For what has been discussed above, keeping in mind the strict 
implications flowing from enlisting a person in the fourth schedule, by 
which practically the life and living of such person is massively 
curtailed as even for medical and educational expenses he needs 
approval from the Federal Government, we are of the view that there 
exist no such grounds which could justify enlisting of appellant in the 
4th schedule. Consequently, the instant appeal is allowed and both the 
impugned orders i.e. dated 18.10.2021 whereby his name was entered 
in the 4th schedule of ATA, 1997 and the order dated 20.09.2022 by
