2. 
The prosecution story as given in the judgment of the trial 
court reads as under:- 
“…The foundation stone of instant felony found 
installed upon application Ex.PQ submitted by 
Muhammad Haroon complainant, with the contention 
that the he is resident of Moazan Abad; that on 
27.06.2016 he alongwith Muhammad Saeed his 
brother came to the house of Mehmood-ur-Rasheed to 
meet him in his house at New Madina colony street 
No. 5, Sargodha. Muhammad Amin resident of street 
No. 1 New Madina colony street No. 5, Sargodha also 
came at the house of Mehmood-ur-Rasheed and they 
were talking whereas Mst. Sobia wife of Mehmood- 
ur-Rasheed was preparing bedding; that in the 
meantime at about 08:30 p.m. Zainab mother of Ali 
Hassan accused and Sidra (Saba) sister of Ali Hassan 
accused being present on roof top of their house 
situated in front of house of his brother started 
abusing; 
that 
Mehmood-ur-Rasheed 
brother 
of 
complainant requested them for pardon and assured 
them that they will leave the house in the morning. 
Afterwards they both came down from the roof while 
abusing and instigated Ali Hassan alias Achoo accused 
to take revenge. Meanwhile, accused persons namely 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
3
Ali Hassan alias Achoo, Khuram Shahzad alias Lahori 
and Hafiz Ibrahim residents of street No. 5, New 
Madina colony while armed with pistols 30-bore came 
there and started firing at the gate of the house while 
found that gate was closed. All the accused trespassed 
into the house forcibly; that Ali Hassan alias Achoo 
accused made a fire shot with intention to kill 
Mehmood-ur-Rasheed which hit him on right side of 
his neck; that Sobia wife of Mehmood- ur-Rasheed 
while taking her sons Subhan aged 2½ years and 
Muhammad Mudassar aged 8 years into the room 
then, Ali Hassan alias Achoo accused made two 
consecutive fire shots from his pistol 30-bore which 
fires hit Muhammad Subhan on backside of his left 
shoulder and on the right side of head of Muhammad 
Mudassar. Luckily, Sobia wife of Mehmood-ur- 
Rasheed remained save. Muhammad Amin informed 
at police 15 through telephone then Hafiz Ibrahim and 
Khuram Shahzad alias Lahori made fire shots from 
their respective pistols 30-bore at Muhammad Amin 
who took shelter behind the wall and fire shots hit at 
the wall. After hearing the firing report people of 
locality reached while accused succeeded in fleeing 
away. Complainant alongwith witnesses attended 
Mehmood-ur-Rasheed, 
Muhammad 
Subhan 
and 
Muhammad Mudassar whereas Mehmood-ur-Rasheed 
and Muhammad Subhan succumbed to the injured and 
Muhammad Mudassar was shifted to DHQ, Hospital, 
Sargodha.  
2. 
The motive behind the occurrence was that a 
previous litigation was existing with Ali Hassan, Ali 
Hassan alias Achoo accused committed the instant 
occurrence on the instigation of her mother Zainab and 
sister Sidra in the company of accused persons 
Khuram and Muhammad Ibrahim….” 
 
3. 
After completion of investigation, report under section 173 
Cr.P.C. was prepared and submitted before the trial court. The trial 
court after observing all pre-trial formalities as provided under the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, framed charge against the 
appellant and his acquitted co-accused on 01-03-2017 under 
sections 109, 449, 302, 324, 337A(i), 34 PPC, to which they 
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove its case, the 
prosecution produced as many as fourteen witnesses during the 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
4
trial; Muhammad Haroon complainant (PW.10), Muhammad Saeed 
(PW.11) and Muhammad Mudassar injured (PW.12) have furnished 
the ocular account. Azmat Ullah 1151/C (PW.2) was the recovery 
witness of pistol 30 bore (P.4) at the instance of appellant vide 
seizure memo Exh.PB. Aman Ullah, S.I (PW.13) being 
investigating officer stated about various steps taken by him during 
the investigation of this case.  
Medical evidence was furnished by Doctor Mohsin Abbas 
Malik (PW.9).  
The remaining witnesses produced by the prosecution before 
the trial court are formal in nature. 
The prosecution gave up PWs namely Abdul Khaliq, 
Muhammad Ishaq, Amin and Sobia being unnecessary and apart 
from oral evidence, the prosecution also produced documentary 
evidence in the shape of Exh.PA to Exh.PZ, Ex.PAA, Ex.PBB, 
Mark-A and Mark-B. 
4. 
Thereafter, the statements under section 342 Cr. P.C. of the 
appellant and his co-accused were recorded wherein they refuted 
the allegations leveled against them and professed their innocence. 
While answering to a question, “why this case is against you and 
why the PWs have deposed against you? the appellant responded as 
under: - 
“All the PWs are closely related to each other and they 
belong to same family. All the PWs were summoned 
from different places including Khushab and Mouazam 
Abad which is situated 45 and 25 kilometers 
respectively away from the place of occurrence. I have 
been made escape goat in this case as some unknown 
persons has committed this occurrence at night time by 
firing at main gate of deceased and the fires hit 
deceased and his son. Since, police and complainant 
party was not able to trace out the real culprits so, I 
alongwith other co-accused were involved in this case 
falsely. I am innocent and was falsely involved due to 
false motive case. ..”

However, the accused neither opted to get themselves 
examined within the scope of section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced 
any defence evidence.  
5. 
   Upon conclusion of trial, the trial court vide judgment 
dated 30-07-2019, while acquitting rest of the accused namely 
Hafiz Muhammad Ibrahim, Khuram Shahzad, Mst. Zainab Bibi and 
Mst. Sidra, convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned in 
paragraph No.1 above.  
6. 
We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the 
appellant as well as learned Additional Prosecutor General assisted 
by learned counsel for the complainant meticulously and also 
perused the record minutely with their able assistance.  
7. 
According to the prosecution version, occurrence in this case 
had taken place on 27-06-2016 at about 8:30 p.m. within the area of 
New Madina Colony, situated at a distance of 03 kilometers from 
Police Station Urban Area, District Sargodha, while the machinery 
of criminal law was set into motion by Muhammad Haroon 
complainant (PW.10) through written application (Exh.PQ) 
submitted to Aman Ullah S.I/I.O (PW.13) on the same night at 
10:00 p.m. and in consequence thereof, Muhammad Nawaz, the 
then ASI/Duty Officer (PW.3) chalked out the FIR (Exh.PY) at the 
aforementioned police station during the same night at                      
10:20 p.m. Keeping in view the above-noted circumstances of the 
case, we are quite confident to hold that the matter was reported to 
the police with sufficient promptitude. Reliance is placed upon the 
case law titled as “Shamsher Ahmad and another vs. The State and 
others” (2022 SCMR 1931).   
8. 
It has vociferously been argued by learned counsel for the 
appellant that there is delay of about nine to ten hours in 
conducting post-mortem examinations on the dead bodies of the 
deceased persons for which the prosecution has not given any 
explanation, meaning thereby, the PWs were not present at the time 
and place of occurrence and prosecution remained busy in planning 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
6
the fake PWs and cooking up a false story, otherwise there was no 
reasoning for such delay. We are not in agreement with this 
contention, because, two persons lost their lives at the spot whereas 
a child was seriously injured in this case, therefore, the conduct of 
complainant party was quite natural as their first preference was to 
save the life of injured child. Moreover, time must have been 
consumed in arranging the vehicles and shifting the dead bodies as 
well as the injured child to the hospital. Keeping in view the 
circumstances of this case, we are of the view that no unusual time 
was consumed in conducting postmortem examinations on the dead 
bodies of the deceased persons. Guidance can be sought from the 
case laws titled as “Muhammad Asif and another vs. Mehboob 
Alam and others” (2020 SCMR 837) and “Maskeen Ullah and 
another vs. The State and another” (2023 SCMR 1568).  
9. 
Ocular account of the incident has been furnished before the 
trial court by three eye witnesses namely Muhammad Haroon 
complainant (PW.10), Muhammad Saeed (PW.11) and Muhammad 
Mudassar, injured (PW.12). Muhammad Haroon complainant 
(PW.10) and Muhammad Saeed (PW.11) are real brothers of 
Mehmood-ur-Rasheed (deceased) and paternal uncles of Subhan 
(deceased) as well as Muhammad Mudassar, injured child (PW.12), 
who is also a real son of Mehmood-ur-Rasheed (deceased) and real 
brother of Subhan (deceased). Muhammad Haroon complainant 
(PW.10) throughout pointed his accusing fingers towards the 
appellant as the main perpetrator of the occurrence, who had caused 
firearm injuries to both the deceased persons namely Mehmood-ur-
Rasheed and Subhan as well as Muhammad Mudassar, injured 
(PW.12) and his (PW.10) deposition is fully supported by the 
depositions of Muhammad Saeed (PW.11) and Muhammad 
Mudassar, injured (PW.12).   
 
So far as the question raised by learned counsel for the 
appellant in respect of availability of eye witnesses at the scene of 
occurrence at relevant time is concerned, we have observed that 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
7
Muhammad Haroon complainant (PW.10) during his court 
statement stated the reason for his presence at the house of his 
deceased brother that he along with his deceased brother used to 
work as a mason in Block No.2 Sargodha city during the days of 
occurrence. He further stated in his cross-examination as under:- 
“….On the alleged day of occurrence we were 
gathered in house of Mehmood ur Rasheed in 
order to consult regarding the previous motive 
case….” 
 
Likewise, Muhammad Saeed (PW.11) also successfully 
proved his presence at the spot at the relevant time by stating that 
he had come to the house of his brother (Mehmood-ur-Rasheed) to 
discuss regarding an already registered case against the appellant 
for committing sodomy with his nephew. Copy of FIR pertaining to 
abovementioned incident has been produced by the prosecution as 
Exh.PBB, wherein it has been categorically mentioned that Ali 
Hassan alias Achoo (appellant) had committed sodomy with 
Muhammad Mudassar injured/child (PW.12). The reasoning 
describe by the above-mentioned PWs was not seriously cross-
examined by the defence and it was only formally suggested to the 
witnesses that they had not witnessed the occurrence. Both the 
above PWs have described cogent explanations for their presence 
in the house of their brother Mehmood-ur-Rasheed (deceased) and 
their availability in the house of occurrence cannot be termed as 
unnatural. The house of real brother can be visited even without 
any task. Third eye witness namely Muhammad Mudassar 
(PW.12), who received firearm injury at the hands of the appellant 
during the incident and was medically examined on the same night 
at DHQ, Hospital Sargodha, was also a natural witness being 
resident of the house where the occurrence took place. They stood 
the test of lengthy cross-examination firmly by making consistent 
statements. Under the given circumstances, the presence of above 
mentioned prosecution witnesses cannot be termed as unusual or 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
8
unnatural, therefore, it can be easily comprehended that they were 
very much present at the relevant time and place of occurrence and 
had been seen the tragic incident with their own eyes.  
10. 
Learned counsel for the appellant further emphasized that 
Muhammad Mudassar injured (PW.12), being a child, was not a 
reliable witness as he had deposed under the influence of his 
paternal uncles namely Muhammad Haroon complainant (PW.10) 
and Muhammad Saeed (PW.11), however, we are not in agreement 
with this assertion of learned counsel for the appellant. We are of 
the considered view that when a child witness responds 
intelligently to cross-examination by the defence, his testimony 
deserves credit and there remains no reason to believe that he had 
deposed under influence or instructions. We may also observe here 
that the child witness, if found intelligent enough, does not 
ordinarily tell lies and his evidence carries higher value than 
ordinary witnesses for the reason that he is generally considered to 
be innocent and obvious of motive and evil considerations. In this 
case, Muhammad Mudassar, injured (PW.12), who was examined 
by the trial court as a ‘child witness’, was found quite capable to 
make statement in accordance with the provision of Article 3 of the 
Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 which envisages that “all persons 
shall be competent to testify unless the Court considers that they 
are prevented from understanding the questions put to them, or 
from giving rational answers to those questions, by tender years, 
extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind or any other 
cause of the same kind”. A careful analysis of the statement of 
Muhammad Mudassar injured (PW.12) demonstrates that the trial 
court by questioning him had fully satisfied itself that he was 
capable of understanding the questions put to him and of giving 
rational answers to those questions. Indeed, the trial court had 
remarked that he also stood the cross-examination well and his 
evidence was in no way shaken by cross-examination. In the 
circumstances, we are of the view that Muhammad Mudassar 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
9
injured (PW.12) was a competent witness. Even otherwise, nothing 
has been pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant from his 
statement which could persuade us to hold that he (PW.12) should 
not have been relied upon merely because he was a child witness. 
Reliance is placed on the case-law titled as “Amjad Javed vs. The 
State” (2002 SCMR 1247), wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
has been pleased to observe as under:- 
“… We have carefully examined the contentions as 
agitated on behalf of petitioner in the light of relevant 
provisions of law and record of the case. We have 
minutely perused the judgment dated 21-6-2000 
passed by the learned Special Court and the judgment 
impugned. The entire evidence has been evaluated 
with care and caution. We have not been persuaded to 
agree with the prime contention of Mr. Rab Nawaz 
Khan Niazi, learned Advocate Supreme Court who 
appeared on behalf of petitioner that the statement of 
Salman (P.W.14)- should have been discarded being a 
child witness coupled with the fact that he was not 
present at the spot for the reason that the said plea has 
been raised in oblivion of the reality as record is 
indicative of the fact that Salman (P.W.14) used to 
accompany his sister Kiran to the house of petitioner 
being their tutor as such the question of his absence 
from the place of occurrence does not arise by whom 
information 
of 
unfortunate 
incident 
was 
communicated to his father. A careful scrutiny of his 
statement would reveal that it is not only worthy of 
credence and confidence-inspiring but consistent and 
straightforward having the ring of truth and innocence. 
Salman (P.W.14) stood firm to the test of cross-
examination in spite of various searching questions 
and nothing advantageous could be elicited. The 
learned trial Court has put various questions and on 
the basis of answers given by Salman (P.W.14) he was 
found intelligent enough to portrait the facts of event 
and accordingly his statement was recorded. In such 
view of the matter we are of the considered view that 
the statement of Salman (P.W.14) has rightly been 
considered and relied upon by the learned trial Court 
as well, as learned Division Bench of the High Court. 
We have absolutely no hesitation in our mind that on 
the basis of such statement conviction could safely be 
awarded. In this .regard we are fortified by the dictum 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
10
laid down in case titled Muhammad Ajmal v. The 
State (1997 SCMR 1595)….” 
 
 
Further guidance can also be sought from the wisdom laid 
down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case-law titled as 
“Mst. Razia alias Jia vs. The State” (2009 S C M R  1428). 
Relevant lines are reproduced as infra for facilitation: - 
“…….. As mentioned above, the trial Court had taken 
all possible and due steps to judge the level of their 
intelligence and maturity before proceeding to record 
their statements. Naveed was 12 years of age whereas 
Naheed Akhtar was of the age of 10 years. It may be 
observed that mere fact that a witness was of tender 
age does not ipso facto make his evidence unreliable. 
It is true that before acting upon the evidence of child 
witnesses, close and careful scrutiny is required which 
in the instant case was duly adopted by the trial Court 
and a note to that effect was also recorded by the trial 
Court about his satisfaction.…...” 
 
11. 
Learned counsel for the appellant also endeavored to contend 
before us that the statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. of said 
Muhammad Mudassar injured (PW.12) was recorded by the police 
with the delay of fifteen days after the occurrence, for the reason, 
his testimony is not reliable. We have observed in this context that 
the delay caused in recording the statement under section 161 
Cr.P.C. of Muhammad Mudassar injured (PW.12) was sufficiently 
explained as he (PW.12) was admitted in the hospital in critical 
condition and there is absolutely no evidence on the file on the 
basis of which it could be construed that Muhammad Mudassar, 
injured (PW.12) was capable to get his statement recorded 
immediately after the occurrence. According to the testimony of 
Aman Ullah, SI/IO (PW.13), on 11-07-2016 he proceeded to Allied 
Hospital, Faisalabad and again made an application (Exh.PX) 
before the Medical Officer for recording the statement of 
Muhammad Mudassar inured (PW.12) which was allowed on            
12-07-2016 and then he recorded the statement under section 161 
Cr.P.C. of Muhammad Mudassar injured (PW.12). Even otherwise, 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
11
ordinarily if the name of an eye witness is mentioned in FIR but the 
investigating agency happens to record his statement after the lapse 
of some time, then it cannot be held that such eye witness is not 
reliable. Reliance is place upon the case titled as “Hamid Javed 
alias Hamidi vs. The State” (1988 SCMR 39).  
12. 
Another objection raised by learned counsel for the appellant 
is that the ocular account in this case has been furnished by related 
and interested witnesses, however, he could not controvert that the 
law has been well-settled by now that an interested witness is one 
who is interested in the conviction of an accused for some ulterior 
motive, but in this case, the defence could not bring on record any 
ulterior motive of the complainant or witnesses to falsely implicate 
the appellant in this case, as observed in the cases titled as “Azhar 
Hussain and another vs. The State and others” (2022 SCMR 1907) 
and “Shamsher Ahmad and another vs. The State and others” 
(2022 SCMR 1931).   
 
Similarly, we are of the unanimous view that due to close and 
blood relation of complainant and the witnesses with the deceased 
persons, they were in fact not likely to let off the actual perpetrator 
of the offence by falsely implicating the appellant, against whom 
they admittedly had no previous malice, ill-will, animosity or 
grudge. It is by now well settled law that substitution of real culprits 
especially in cases where the eye witnesses lost their kith and kin 
before their own eyes is a rare phenomenon. Reliance is placed on 
the cases of “Asfandiyar vs. The State and other” (2021 SCMR 
2009) and “Muhammad Abbas & another vs. The State” (2023 
SCMR 487).   
13.   Learned counsel for the appellant emphatically argued that 
there is a conflict between the ocular account and the medical 
evidence, because, as per the story of prosecution mentioned in 
crime report (Exh.PY), the appellant had made pistol fire shot which 
landed on right side of neck of Mehmood-ur-Rasheed (deceased) but 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
12
according the Doctor Mohsin Abbas Malik (PW.9) as well as 
autopsy report (Exh.PH), a firearm wound of entry measuring 1 cm 
x 1 cm has been noted on back of junction of head and neck left side 
with inverted margins and blackening. However, we are of the view 
that the deceased was not a static object and he might had changed 
his position during the occurrence and in the same way, when fire 
shots were being made in a turmoil then exact locale and distance 
could not have been described, thus, this minor variation is not 
helpful to the defence. Besides, medical evidence is in complete 
harmony with the consistent ocular account furnished by the eye-
witnesses and no material conflict could be pointed out to create 
dent in the prosecution case as the ante-mortem firearm injuries on 
the bodies of both the deceased persons namely Mehmood-ur-
Rasheed and Subhan attributed by the eye witnesses to appellant, are 
reflected in their postmortem reports (Exh.PH and Exh.PL). 
Similarly the injury attributed to appellant on the head of 
Muhammad Mudassar, injured (PW.12) is also categorically 
mentioned in his MLR (Exh.PO). While holding so, we fortify our 
view from the case law titled as “Abdur Rauf Vs. The State and 
another” (2003 SCMR 522) wherein it has been held as under:- 
“….we may observe that the minor discrepancies in 
the medical evidence relating to the seat of injuries 
would also not negate the direct evidence as the 
witnesses are not supposed to give photo picture of 
each detail of injuries in such situation, therefore, the 
conflict of nature of ocular account with medical as 
pointed out being not material would have no adverse 
effect on the prosecution case…. 
 
We have further noted that the ocular evidence about the kind 
of weapon used during the occurrence as well as the time of 
incident narrated by eye witnesses has fully tallied with medical 
evidence. Similarly ocular account is found trustworthy and 
confidence inspiring and for this reason, it is given preference over 
medical evidence and same alone is sufficient to sustain conviction 
of the appellant. Reliance is placed upon the case laws titled as “Ali 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
13
Taj and others vs. The State” (2023 SCMR 900) and “Muhammad 
Hanif vs. The State” (2023 SCMR 2016).  
14. 
Emphasize has also been laid by learned counsel for the 
appellant that the occurrence had taken place at night time but the 
complainant and the PWs did not produce any source of light to the 
investigating officer and in the same way the investigating officer 
has also not taken into possession any source of light, for the 
reason, there was a chance of misidentification of the appellant. In 
this context, we have noted that as per site plan (Exh.PF), houses of 
appellant and Mehmood-ur-Rasheed (deceased) were in front of 
each other, in this way, the appellant was well-known to the 
complainant party, which eliminates the chance of misidentification 
of the appellant. In addition to the above, it has been specifically 
mentioned in FIR (Exh.PY) that the light was on in the house at the 
time of occurrence. It is also evident from site plan (Exh.PF) and 
the statements of eye witnesses that the occurrence had taken place 
in the house of deceased and injured and at point No.12 of the site 
plan (Exh.PF), it has been mentioned that electric bulb was installed 
and was lit. Besides, Muhammad Haroon, complainant (PW.10) and 
Muhammad Saeed (PW.11) have categorically stated in their 
examinations-in-chief that they had witnessed the tragedy in light of 
electric bulb, which was lit at the time and place of occurrence. In 
the same manner, Aman Ullah, SI (PW.13) has also stated in his 
examination-in-chief that he completed the whole proceedings at 
the spot in the light of electric bulb. In the backdrop of above 
circumstances, we are of the view that if the electric bulb (source of 
light) was not taken into possession by the investigating officer, 
even then it is no ground to discard the whole trustworthy and 
confidence inspiring evidence of the prosecution. Reliance is placed 
upon the case law titled as “Muhammad Yaqoob vs. The State and 
others” (2021 SCMR 1387) wherein the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has observed as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
14
“….Presence of electric lights at the mosque presented 
ample opportunity for the identification of assailants, 
each named in the crime report. Darkness by itself does 
not provide immunity to an offender if the witnesses 
otherwise succeed to capture/ascertain his identity 
through available means, conspicuously mentioned in 
the crime report. On our independent analysis, the 
totality of circumstances does not space any hypothesis 
other than petitioner’s guilt and, thus, do not find 
ourselves in a position to take a view different than 
concurrently taken by the courts below…” 
15. 
Apart from the above, the defence in statement under section 
342 Cr.P.C. has seriously criticized that it was not the appellant, 
who committed this occurrence. According to him (appellant), he 
has been made a scapegoat in this case as some unknown persons 
had committed this occurrence at night time by firing at main gate 
of deceased. In this regard, we may observe here that all the eye 
witnesses 
i.e. 
Muhammad 
Haroon, 
complainant 
(PW.10), 
Muhammad Saeed (PW.11) and Muhammad Mudassar, injured 
(PW.12) have consistently deposed that the appellant was the actual 
perpetrator but on the contrary, the defence has miserably failed to 
shatter the evidence of above-said witnesses, therefore, the above 
version adopted by the appellant appears to us to be an afterthought 
story, fabricated by him in order to save his skin. We may also 
observe here that when an accused takes a particular stance, onus to 
prove such stance shifts on the shoulders of accused but in this 
case, the defence did not produce any evidence in support of the 
plea of appellant. Thus, we are quite confident to hold that the 
prosecution has proved the ocular account through sound, cogent, 
motivating, trustworthy, reliable and confidence inspiring eye 
witness account.  
16. 
Insofar as the contention raised by the learned counsel for the 
appellant that co-accused Hafiz Muhammad Ibrahim, Khuram 
Shahzad alias Lahori, Mst. Zainab Bibi and Mst. Sidra Bibi stood 
acquitted by the trial court through the impugned judgment while 
disbelieving the same evidence which rendered the credibility of 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
15
prosecution evidence seriously doubtful even against the appellant 
is concerned, we have noted that the role attributed to the acquitted 
co-accused was entirely different as no overt act or injury qua the 
deceased persons or the injured was attributed to them. In our view, 
acquittal of co-accused, in the circumstances of this case, is not 
sufficient to discredit the prosecution evidence available against the 
appellant.  
17.      It is noteworthy that the ocular account is fully corroborated 
by the recovery of weapon of offence i.e. pistol 30 bore (P.4)  from 
the possession of appellant vide recovery memo (Exh.PB) and 
positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
(Exh.PAA). We have observed that Aman Ullah, SI (P.13) secured 
seven crime empties vide recovery memo (Exh.PU) during spot 
inspection on 27-06-2016 and according to the report (Exh.PAA), 
all the empties were found to have been fired in the weapon of 
offence i.e. pistol 30 bore (P.4) recovered at the instance of 
appellant, therefore, the prosecution has successfully proved the 
recovery of weapon of offence against the appellant.  
18. 
We have also given due consideration to the prosecution 
evidence with regard to motive part of the occurrence and have 
observed that firstly, Muhammad Haroon, complainant  (PW.10) in 
his statement (Exh.PQ) disclosed about the existence of previous 
litigation between the parties and then to prove the motive part of 
the occurrence, the prosecution also produced copy of FIR 
(Exh.PBB) bearing No.267 dated 22-05-2016, under section 377 
PPC registered at Police Station Urban Area, Sargodh, which was 
got registered by Mehmood-ul-Rasheed (deceased) against the 
appellant with the accusation of committing sodomy with his son 
namely Muhammad Mudassar, injured (PW.12), who during his 
court statement also fully supported the motive part of the 
occurrence, therefore, the prosecution has also successfully proved 
the motive part of its case.

19. 
Aftermath of above discussion is that the prosecution, by 
producing cogent, concrete, consistent and trustworthy evidence, 
has quite comfortably established that Ali Hassan alias Achoo, 
appellant had committed brutal and merciless murders of two 
innocent persons who were father and son inter-se and amongst 
them the latter was just aged about two and half years. The 
prosecution has also successfully proved beyond any shadow of 
doubt that the victim of motive of the occurrence had also received 
injuries at the hands of appellant but luckily he survived. Therefore, 
all the charges under section 449 PPC for trespassing into the house 
of complainant party; under section 302(b) PPC (on two counts) for 
committing Qatl-e-Amd of Mehmood-ur-Rasheed and Subhan and 
under sections 324, 337A(i) PPC for causing murderous assault and 
firearm injury to Muhammad Mudassar injured (PW.12) are proved 
against the appellant. We, therefore, uphold his conviction under 
Sections 302(b), 324, 337A(i) and 449 PPC.  
20. 
As regards the quantum of sentences, learned counsel for the 
appellant though prayed for altering death sentence of appellant 
with the sentence of imprisonment for life on the charge under 
section 302(b) PPC, but he has not been able to plead any 
mitigating 
circumstance 
for 
imposing 
lesser 
penalty 
of 
imprisonment for life. The appellant (Ali Hassan alias Achoo) has 
committed a cruel and wanton act by taking the lives of two 
innocent persons and injuring a child namely Muhammad 
Mudassar, injured (PW.12) with whom he had allegedly committed 
sodomy prior to the present incident and a criminal case of that 
offence already stood registered against him. We, therefore, see no 
extenuating or mitigating circumstances for altering the death 
sentence rather we are convinced that only the sentence of death 
would meet  the ends of justice.  
21. 
 For the foregoing reasons, Criminal Appeal No. 71917 of 
2019 filed by Ali Hassan alias Achoo, appellant is dismissed, his 
sentence of death on the charge under Section 302(b) PPC, on two 

Murder Reference No. 256 of 2019 &  
Criminal Appeal   No. 71917 of 2019  
17
counts, is upheld and the order of payment of compensation passed 
against him by the trial court is also maintained. In the same 
manner, his remaining sentences under sections 324, 337A(i),              
449 PPC are also maintained and upheld.  
22. 
As the sentence of death passed by the trial court against Ali 
Hassan alias Achoo appellant (on two counts) has been confirmed 
by us, therefore, Murder Reference No.256 of 2019 is answered in 
affirmative.
