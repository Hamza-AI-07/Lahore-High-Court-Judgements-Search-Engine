Chaudhary Hamayun Mahmood 
and another 
  
 
 
 
Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:-  Through this constitutional 
petition, the petitioners/Lahore Development Authority has 
challenged the validity of order dated 16.11.2022 passed by the 
Commissioner, Lahore Division, Lahore who accepted the 
application of the respondent No.1 and de-notified the acquired 
land measuring 17 Kanal 02 Marla of Khasra No.635 & 636 
situated at Moza Bhobtian, Tehsil Raiwind, District Lahore.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that the notification under 
Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was issued on 
28.04.2003 [gazetted on 29.04.2003] for acquisition of land for 
establishment of “LDA Avenue Housing Scheme” and thereafter 
notifications under Section 17(4) & 6 of the Act ibid bearing 
No.2385 & 2386 were issued on 04.07.2003 [gazetted on 
08.07.2003] and accordingly award was announced on 
24.10.2003. On 18.05.2022, respondent No.1 filed an application 
under Section 48 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 for de-
Date of hearing

notification of the land measuring 17 Kanal 02 Marla comprising 
Khasra No.635 (08 Kanal 18 Marla) and Khasra No.636 (08 
Kanal 04 Marla) situated at Moza Bhobtian Tehsil Raiwind, 
District Lahore. The said application was accepted vide order 
dated 16.11.2022 by the Commissioner, Lahore Division who de-
notified the acquisition of the said land which resulted into filing 
of this petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the suit 
land was acquired in the year 2003 against which the assessed 
amount of compensation was deposited with the Land 
Acquisition Collector. The master plan of the housing scheme 
had finally been drawn and substantial development work for the 
infrastructure of the scheme has been accomplished and 
possession of the khasra numbers have already been obtained by 
the petitioners upon which plots have been carved out and 
allotted to different persons, as such the impugned order has been 
passed without any reasoning therefore same is liable to be set 
aside. 
4. 
Respondent No.1 filed reply to the writ petition and 
pleaded that possession of the land was not completely obtained 
by the Lahore Development Authority since acquiring of the 
land, thus the Commissioner was well within jurisdiction under 
Section 48 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 to de-acquire/de-
notify the land. Learned counsel for the respondent No.1 has 
supported the impugned order and prayed for dismissal of instant 
petition.  
5. 
I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have 
gone through the record. 
6. 
Admittedly, petitioners/L.D.A acquired land of Moza 
Bhobtian Tehsil Raiwind, District Lahore for establishment of 
“LDA Avenue-I Housing Scheme” and notification under Section 

 
W.P.No.8177/2023 
 
3
4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was issued on 28.04.2003 
[gazetted on 29.04.2003] in which Khasra Nos.635 & 636 of 
Moza Bhobtian Tehsil Raiwind District Lahore were included. 
Thereafter, notification under Section 17(4) and 6 of the Act ibid 
was issued on 04.07.2003 [gazetted on 08.07.2003] wherein 
khasra Nos.635 & 636 of the respondents’ predecessor were duly 
mentioned. On 24.10.2003, Award No.6 of the acquired land was 
issued 
including 
the 
impugned 
Khasra 
Numbers 
and 
compensation was also deposited with the Land Acquisition 
Collector concerned. This shows that the land of Khasra Nos.635 
& 636 was also acquired in accordance with law. After taking 
possession of Khasra Numbers 635 & 636 on 25.09.2003, the 
petitioner/L.D.A. carved out as many as 27 plots in the said 
khasra numbers. The detail whereof is as under:-

And above said plots of both Khasras number were allotted to 
different allottees who had paid the cost of land as well as 
development charges to the acquiring agency and after payment 
of consideration amount a tangible right / title had stood accrued 
in their favour and no hearing was afforded to the said lawful 
allottees by the Commissioner and nor their vested interest has 

 
W.P.No.8177/2023 
 
5
been safeguarded. Even no request was made by the acquiring 
agency for de-acquisition of the said acquired land. Further it is 
worth mentioning here that all the surrounding khasra numbers to 
khasra Nos. 635 & 636 were under litigation through W.P. 
No.16022/2003 filed by Dilawaz Iqbal etc. and ICA whereof but 
in the said litigation, the impugned khasra numbers were not sub 
judice but due to pendency of the above litigation the 
development work of the said housing scheme remained 
incomplete over the said Khasra numbers. Another lis was 
instituted by Dilawaz etc. by filing W.P. No.4504/2007 and 
against the decision of the writ petition an Intra Court Appeal 
No.806/2009 is still pending in this Court, thus the main hurdle in 
completion of the work was due to pendency of the above 
litigation.  
7. 
The main controversy in this petition is that as to whether 
under the land acquisition enactment, the Commissioner has any 
jurisdiction to issue declaration regarding de-acquisition of an 
acquired land, suffice it to say that as per Section 48(1) of the 
Land Acquisition Act 1894, the government has the power to 
withdraw from acquisition of any land of whose possession has 
not been taken. For reference, Section 48(1) of the Land 
Acquisition Act, 1894 is reproduced as under: 
“48.Completion of acquisition not compulsory, but 
compensation to be awarded when not completed.– (1) 
Except in the case provided for in section 36, the Government 
shall be at liberty to withdraw from the acquisition of any land 
of which possession has not been taken. 
As expounded from the above provision, the Commissioner has 
no jurisdiction to exclude the acquired land under the Land 
Acquisition Act, 1894 rather it is only the Government who is 
shown competent to de-acquire the land. This Court while 
dealing with an alike matter regarding de-notification of the 
acquired land by an Executive District Officer (Revenue) has 

 
W.P.No.8177/2023 
 
6
elaborately discussed this issue in a judgment cited as 
Muhammad Nawaz Vs. Government of Punjab, through Chief 
Secretary, Lahore and others (2017 MLD 1719). The relevant 
portion whereof is as under:  
“9. 
It is an admitted fact that the land measuring 142-Kanals 13-
Marlas of Village Wasu and measuring 451-Kanals 09-Marlas of 
Village Sohawa Bulani, Tehsil & District Mandi Baha-ud-Din was 
acquired for “Construction of State of the Art, District Headquarters 
Hospital and allied facilities, Mandi Baha-ud-Din near District 
Complex Mandi Baha-ud-Din. In this regard Award has already been 
announced on 04.06.2007 and thereafter a Mutation was duly 
sanctioned in favour of the Health Department. The respondent No.8 
challenged the Notification under Section 4 of Land Acquisition 
Act,1894 through Writ Petition No.1782/2006 which was disposed of 
on 15.06.2006. The respondent No.8 withdrew his Reference under 
Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act,1894  from the Court of 
Learned Senior Civil Judge Mandi Baha-ud-Din and filed the 
application in the office of Executive District Officer(Revenue) for 
de-notification  of the acquired land measuring 142-Kanals 13-
Marlas during the pendency of Intra Court Appeal and the acquired 
land has been de-notified by the then Executive District Officer 
(Revenue) Mandi Baha-ud-Din vide Order dated 14.09.2010. 
10. 
Under Section 48 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 only 
Government has an exclusive jurisdiction to withdraw the acquisition 
process and Executive District Officer (Revenue) is not stand 
anywhere. Section 48 is as under:- 
Completion of acquisition not compulsory, but compensation 
to be awarded when not completed:- (1) Except in the case 
provided for in Section 36, the Government shall be at liberty 
to withdraw from the acquisition of any land of which 
possession has not been taken. 
 
11. 
Under Section 48 Ibid, the Government is at liberty to 
withdraw acquisition proceedings of any land on which possession 
has not been taken whereas there is no intention of the Government 
to withdraw the acquisition proceedings is on record. The 
Government acquired the land in question for the welfare of the 
public at large/for construction of a Hospital. The Executive District 
Officer (Revenue) passed the impugned Order without obtaining any 
permission or instructions from the Government, as such, the 
impugned Order is a classic example of misuse of official power, as 
such, it is illegal, without lawful authority. Reliance is placed on the 
cases reported as National Police Foundation  Co-operative Housing 
Society Ltd Versus Board of Revenue, Government of Punjab, Lahore 
and 2 others (PLD 1984 Lahore 191) Fida Hussain and 2 others 
Versus Province of Punjab through Secretary, Settlement, Board of 
Revenue Punjab Lahore and 4 others,(2002 CLC 790).

16. 
In latest Judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
titled as Province of Punjab through A.D Fisheries Sialkot Versus 
Rana Abdul Hameed and others (2014 SCMR 1187) it was held that 
no Court/forum with the Revenue hierarchy can set aside the 
acquisition of land or the order which have been passed including 
Notification under Section 4 & 17 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 
which is as under:- 
 
The revenue forums in nutshell have proceeded to 
decide the case by holding that the land acquired should be 
returned to respondent Rana Abdul Hameed etc. It is quite 
clear that the revenue hierarchy does not figure anywhere in 
land acquisition proceedings. No Court/forum within the 
revenue hierarchy can, therefore, set aside the acquisition of 
land or the orders which have been passed including 
notifications under Section 4 and 17 of the Land  Acquisition 
Act pursuant to which title in the land stood transferred to the 
Fisheries Department of the Province. 
 
Considering the above, we are clear that the orders 
including the impugned judgment proceeded on the erroneous 
premise, that the revenue forums had jurisdiction in the 
matter. Learned counsel representing the respondents 
acknowledged that the Revenue forums had no jurisdiction to 
interfere in land acquisition proceedings, or to direct the 
Government to return the acquired land to the respondents. 
The orders of the Revenue authorities, therefore, being 
without jurisdiction, are set aside. This petition, as a 
consequence, is converted into appeal and the same is 
accordingly allowed. It is stated, however, that compensation 
for the acquired land has not yet been paid to the respondents 
land owners. The said respondents subject to law, may avail 
whatever remedies are available to them under the law 
because the learned Law Officer states that the  compensation 
awarded by the LAC was deposited with the Collector in 1976. 
17. 
Muhammad Khalid Nazir, the then Executive District Officer 
(Revenue), was not competent to de-notify the acquired land.  
According to the Award and other relevant record it is crystal clear 
that the land has been delivered to the Health Department, which is 
still intact. The Health Department filed comments in this Writ 
Petition and prayed that the impugned De-Notification No.550-A 
dated 14.09.2010 may kindly be declared illegal, malafide, without 
lawful authority and of no legal effect. It means that the Health 
Department never surrendered the acquired land and it is required to 
be Health Department for the construction of hospital. The Acquired 
land could not be de-notified. The Mutation has already been duly 
sanctioned in favour of the Health Department. During process of de-
notification, the Department never summoned, nor heard any person, 
all the process was kept in secret and the impugned order was also not 
endorsed to the acquiring Department.” 
 
Further, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a recent 
pronouncement titled as Government of Pakistan through 

 
W.P.No.8177/2023 
 
8
Secretary Ministry of Defence Rawalpindi and another Vs. 
Akhtar Ullah Khan Khattak and others (PLD 2024 SC 218) has 
held that once possession of acquired land has been taken, that 
land could not be de-notified. Relevant portion of the judgment 
(supra) is reproduced as under: 
 “10. In the position of law stated above, since the 
appellants/petitioners had taken possession of the land in 
pursuance of the award under Section 11 of the Land 
Acquisition Act, 1894, the acquisition had become past and 
closed, denuding the Commissioner of the right to withdraw, 
rescind, recall or amend any notification regarding the 
acquisition. Therefore, he could not rely on Section 48 merely 
because the acquiring department had no funds to pay for the 
compensation.” 
8. 
Here in the lis in hand, the entire compensation amount 
under the award has been deposited and possession of the 
acquired land has been obtained by the acquiring agency /L.D.A 
who has carved out plots over it and also allotted the said plots to 
different persons, as such the Commissioner, Lahore Division, 
Lahore was denuded from any jurisdiction to de-notify the said 
acquired land. 
9.  
Even otherwise, notification under Section 4 of the Act 
ibid of land in question was issued on 28.04.2003, notification 
17(4) and 6 of the Act ibid was issued on 04.07.2003 whereas 
award was issued on 24.10.2003 but the respondent No.1 
purchased the land falling in Khasra Nos.635 & 636 through 
registered sale deed No.50915 dated 03.10.2011 in Moza 
Bhobatian and mutation No.664 was incorporated in the revenue 
record, whereas at the time of entering into sale transaction ex-
owner/ vendor was not holding any title of the land as after 
acquisition, title of the land vested free from all encumbrances in 
favour of the petitioner/  LDA whereafter no sale transaction of 
the said land could be made by ex-owner and even if any 
transaction of sale was made by ex-owner after issuance of 

 
W.P.No.8177/2023 
 
9
notifications and award whereof, that transaction could not 
convey any right or title in favour of the subsequent purchaser. 
The issuance of notifications under Land Acquisition Act, 1894 
was a caution for public to stay away from entering into any 
sale/purchase transaction  subsequent to the issuance of the 
notification and if any alienation is made then it would be at the 
risk and cost of the said vendee. This Court has elaborately 
discussed this issue in its judgment titled as Wali Rehman Vs The 
Additional Commissioner (Revenue) Gujranwala Division & 7 
Others (2022 CLC 106), the relevant portion whereof is 
reproduced as under: 
“5.  
The object of Notification under Section 4 of the Act is 
to disclose the intention and need of the Govt. and also to give 
notice to public at large that land subject matter of Notification 
is required for public purposes. The Notification under the above 
provision is merely an introductory measure, tentative in nature 
and furnishes the foundation of carrying out the subsequent 
proceedings of acquisition as well as it is amounting to a 
cautioning the public that any transaction/alienation made 
subsequent to the issuance of notification would be at the risk 
and cost of the respective parties as held by this Court in a 
judgment cited as Messrs Eden Developers (Pvt.) Limited Vs. 
Government of the Punjab and others (PLD 2017 Lahore 
442). Further the said Notification empowers the officer 
concerned to carry on preliminary investigation in order to reach 
the final conclusion whether said land is required for the public 
purpose or otherwise. Through Notification under Section 4 of 
the Act ibid only the primary tentative intention of the 
Government is expressed and it could not be considered as 
conclusive / ultimate decision of the government rather it is a 
precautionary notice/warning to the public at large. Reliance is 
also placed on a case cited as Sardar Dildar Ahmad 
Cheema Vs. Board of Revenue, Punjab through Member 
(Revenue) and others (PLD 2013 Lahore 565) wherein it is 
held as under:- 
“11. It is settled principle of law that purpose of 
issuance of Notification under Section 4 of the Act of 
1894 is to give a notice to the public at large that land 
subject matter of the notification is required for a 
public purpose, and it further means that there will be 
“an impediment to any one to encumber the land 
acquired thereunder”, this mean any encumbrance 

 
W.P.No.8177/2023 
 
10
created after the gazette notification, all encumbrances 
will be void against the State…….”     
6. 
The issuance of notification under Section 6 of Act ibid is 
a conclusive declaration that the land is needed for public 
purpose and the object of the Section 17 of the Act ibid is to 
allow an authority to proceed with the matter without waiting 
completion of other formalities. Once possession of the land is 
taken under Section 17 of the Act ibid, whereafter the title of the 
land for all intents and purposes vests free from all 
encumbrances in the name of the government and the ownership 
of the previous proprietor by operation of law stand ceased / 
extinguished whereafter the land owner was stripped off from 
the legal authority / right to make any transaction of the said 
acquire land and any person who purchases the acquired land 
during or after the acquisition proceedings is debarred to 
challenge the acquisition proceedings and if any sale/alienation 
of the land so acquired is executed that would be void and non-
existence in the eyes of law. Reliance in this regard is placed on 
a recent case law rendered by the Supreme Court of India cited 
as Shiv Kumar and Ors. Vs. Union of India (UOI) and Ors. 
(AIR 2019 SC 5374) the relevant portion whereof is reproduced 
as under: 
6. First, we advert to the legal position concerning the 
purchases made on 5.7.2001, made after notification 
under Section 4 had been issued under the Act of 1894. 
Law is well settled in this regard by a catena of 
decisions of this Court that an incumbent, who has 
purchased the land after section 4 notification, has no 
right to question the acquisition.  
6(a). In U.P. Jal Nigam, Lucknow through its 
Chairman & Anr. v. Kalra Properties (P) Ltd., 
Lucknow & Ors. (1996) 3 SCC 124 it was observed : 
3. ...That apart, since M/s. Kalra Properties, the 
respondent had purchased the land after the 
notification under Section 4(1) was published, 
its sale is void against the State, and it acquired 
no right, title, or interest in the land. 
Consequently, it is settled law that it cannot 
challenge the validity of the notification or the 
regularity in taking possession of the land 
before the publication of the declaration under 
Section 6 was published." 
6(b). In Sneh Prabha (Smt.) & Ors. v. State of U.P. & 
Anr. (1996) 7 SCC 426 it has been laid down that 
subsequent purchaser cannot take advantage of land 
policy. It was observed:  
"5. Though at first blush, we were inclined to 
agree with the appellant but on a deeper probe, 
we find that the appellant is not entitled to the 
benefit of the Land Policy. It is settled law that 

 
W.P.No.8177/2023 
 
11
any person who purchases land after the 
publication of the notification under Section 
4(1), does so at his/her peril. The object of 
publication of the notification under Section 
4(1) is notice to everyone that the land is 
needed or is likely to be needed for a public 
purpose, and the acquisition proceedings point 
out an impediment to anyone to encumber the 
land acquired thereunder. It authorizes the 
designated officer to enter upon the land to do 
preliminaries, etc. Therefore, any alienation of 
land after the publication of the notification 
under Section 4(1) does not bind the 
Government or the beneficiary under the 
acquisition. On taking possession of the land, 
all rights, titles, and interests in land stand 
vested in the State, under Section 16 of the Act, 
free from all encumbrances, and thereby, 
absolute title in the land is acquired thereunder. 
If any subsequent purchaser acquires land, 
his/her only right would be subject to the 
provisions of the Act and/ or to receive 
compensation for the land. In a recent 
judgment, this Court in Union of India v. Shri 
Shivkumar Bhargava and Ors. [1995] 1 SCR 
354 considered the controversy and held that a 
person who purchases land subsequent to the 
notification is not entitled to an alternative site. 
It is seen that the Land Policy expressly 
conferred that right only on that person whose 
land was acquired. In other words, the person 
must be the owner of the land on the date on 
which notification under Section 4(1) was 
published. By necessary implication, the 
subsequent purchaser was elbowed out from 
the policy and became disentitled to the benefit 
of the Land Policy." 
6(c). In Meera Sahni v. Lieutenant Governor of Delhi 
& Ors. (2008) 9 SCC 177, the Court had relied upon 
the decision described above and observed thus: 
"21. In view of the aforesaid decisions, it is by 
now well-settled law that under the Land 
Acquisition Act, the subsequent purchaser 
cannot challenge the acquisition proceedings 
and that he would be only entitled to get the 
compensation." 
6(d). In V. Chandrasekaran & Anr. v. Administrative 
Officer & Ors. (2012) 12 SCC 133, the Court has 
considered various decisions and opined that the 
purchaser after Section 4 notification could not 
challenge land acquisition on any ground whatsoever. 
The Court observed:  

 
W.P.No.8177/2023 
 
12
"15. The issue of maintainability of the writ 
petitions by the person who purchases the land 
subsequent to a notification being issued under 
Section 4 of the Act has been considered by 
this Court time and again. In Leela Ram v. 
Union of India AIR 1975 SC 2112, this Court 
held that anyone who deals with the land 
subsequent to a Section 4 notification being 
issued, does so, at his own peril. In Sneh 
Prabha v. State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 1996 SC 
540, this Court held that a Section 4 
notification gives a notice to the public at large 
that the land in respect to which it has been 
issued, is needed for a public purpose, and it 
further points out that there will be "an 
impediment to anyone to encumber the land 
acquired thereunder." The alienation after that 
does not bind the State or the beneficiary under 
the acquisition. The purchaser is entitled only 
to receive compensation. While deciding the 
said case, reliance was placed on an earlier 
judgment of this Court in Union of India v. 
Shiv Kumar Bhargava and Ors. (1995) 2 SCC 
427. 
18. In view of the above, the law on the issue 
can be summarized to the effect that a person 
who purchases land subsequent to the issuance 
of a Section 4 notification with respect to it, is 
not competent to challenge the validity of the 
acquisition 
proceedings 
on 
any 
ground 
whatsoever, for the reason that the sale deed 
executed in his favour does not confer upon 
him, any title and at the most he can claim 
compensation on the basis of his vendor's title.          
(emphasis supplied)  
6(e). In Rajasthan State Industrial Development and 
Investment Corpn. v. Subhash Sindhi Cooperative 
Housing Society, Jaipur & Ors. (2013) 5 SCC 427, it is 
laid down: 
13. There can be no quarrel with respect to the 
settled legal proposition that a purchaser, 
subsequent to the issuance of a Section 4 
Notification in respect of the land, cannot 
challenge the acquisition proceedings, and can 
only claim compensation as the sale transaction 
in such a situation is Void qua the Government. 
Any such encumbrance created by the owner, 
or any transfer of the land in question that is 
made after the issuance of such a notification 
would be deemed to be void and would not be 
binding on the Government. (Vide: Gian Chand 
v. Gopala and Ors. (1995) 2 SCC 528; Yadu

Society is V. Chandrasekaran and Anr. v. 
Administrative Officer and Ors. 2012 (12) SCC 
133] wherein this Court laid down thus: 
17. In Ajay Kishan Singhal v. Union of 
India: AIR 1996 SC 2677; Mahavir and 
Anr. v. Rural Institute, Amravati and 
Anr. (1995) 5 SCC 335; Gian Chand v. 
Gopala and Ors. (1995) 2 SCC 528; and 
Meera Sahni v. Lieutenant Governor of 
Delhi and Ors. (2008) 9 SCC 177, this 
Court categorically held that a person 
who purchases land after the publication 
of a Section 4 notification with respect 
to it, is not entitled to challenge the 
proceedings for the reason, that his title 
is void and he can at best claim 
compensation on the basis of vendor's 
title. In view of this, the sale of land 
after issuance of a Section 4 notification 
is void, and the purchaser cannot 
challenge the acquisition proceedings. 
(See also: Tika Ram v. the State of U.P. 
(2009) 10 SCC 689). 
18. In view of the above, the law on the 
issue can be summarized to the effect 
that a person who purchases land 
subsequent to the issuance of a Section 
4 notification with respect to it, is not 
competent to challenge the validity of 
the acquisition proceedings on any 
ground whatsoever, for the reason that 
the sale deed executed in his favour 
does not confer upon him, any title and 

 
W.P.No.8177/2023 
 
14
at the most he can claim compensation 
on the basis of his vendor's title. 
34. Reliance has been placed on Dossibai 
Nanabhoy Jeejeebhoy v. P.M. Bharucha 1958 
(60) Bom.LR 1208] so as to contend that the 
'person interested' in the land under Section 9 
of the Land Acquisition Act would include a 
person who claims interest in compensation to 
be paid on account of acquisition of land ad the 
interest contemplated Under Section 9 is not 
restricted to legal or proprietary estate or 
interest in the land but such interest as will 
sustain a claim to apportionment, is the owner 
of the land. In our opinion, the decision is of no 
avail. The instant transaction being void as per 
Section 42 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, and 
the property was inalienable to non-SC. 
Obviously, the logical corollary has to be taken 
that no right in apportionment to compensation 
can be claimed by the Society." 
6(g). In M. Venkatesh & Ors. v. Commissioner, 
Bangalore Development Authority, etc. (2015) 17 SCC 
1, a three Judge Bench has opined: 
“16. That brings us to the question of whether 
Prabhaudas Patel and other respondents in SLP 
(C) No.12016 of 2013 were entitled to any 
relief from the Court. These respondents claim 
to have purchased the suit property in terms of 
a sale deed dated 22-8-1990, i.e., long after the 
issuance 
of 
the 
preliminary 
Notification 
published in July 1984. The legal position 
about the validity of any such sale, post-
issuance of preliminary notification, is fairly 
well settled by a long line of the decisions of 
this Court. The sale in such cases is void and 
non-est in the eye of the law giving to the 
vendee the limited right to claim compensation 
and no more. Reference may in this regard be 
made to the decision of this Court in U.P. Jal 
Nigam v. Kalra Properties (P) Ltd, wherein 
this Court said: (SCC pp. 126-27, para 3) 
“3. … It is settled law that after the 
notification under Section 4(1) is 
published 
in 
the 
gazette, 
any 
encumbrance created by the owner does 
not bind the Government, and the 
purchaser does not acquire any title to 
the property. In this case, Notification 
under Section 4(1) was published on 
24-3-1973; possession of the land 
admittedly was taken on 5-7-1973, and 
the 
pumping 
station 
house 
was 
constructed. No doubt, 
declaration 
under Section 6 was published later on 
8-7-1973. Admittedly power under 
Section 17(4) was exercised dispensing 

 
W.P.No.8177/2023 
 
15
with the inquiry under Section 5-A and 
on service of the notice under Section 9 
possession was taken, since urgency 
was acute viz. pumping station house 
was to be constructed to drain out 
floodwater. Consequently, the land 
stood vested in the State under Section 
17(2) free from all encumbrances. It is 
further settled law that once possession 
is taken, by operation of Section 17(2), 
the land vests in the State free from all 
encumbrances unless a notification 
under Section 48(1) is published in the 
gazette 
withdrawing 
from 
the 
acquisition. Section 11-A, as amended 
by Act 68 of 1984, therefore, does not 
apply, and the acquisition does not 
lapse. The notification under Section 
4(1) and the declaration under Section 
6, therefore, remain valid. There is no 
other provision under the Act to have 
the acquired land divested, unless, as 
stated earlier, notification under Section 
48(1) was published, and the possession 
is surrendered pursuant thereto. That 
apart, since M/s Kalra Properties, the 
respondent had purchased the land after 
the notification under Section 4(1) was 
published, its sale is void against the 
State, and 10 it acquired no right, title, 
or interest in the land. Consequently, it 
is settled law that it cannot challenge 
the validity of the notification or the 
regularity in taking possession of the 
land before the publication of the 
declaration 
under 
Section 
6 
was 
published. 
 
7. It has been laid down that the purchasers on 
any 
ground 
whatsoever 
cannot 
question 
proceedings for taking possession. A purchaser 
after Section 4 notification does not acquire any 
right in the land as the sale is ab initio void and 
has no right to claim land under the Policy.” 
 
    (emphasis supplied)" 
 
 
10. 
As regard the claim of the respondent No.1 who asserted 
to be bona fide subsequent purchaser of the property in question 
and has protection of Section 41 of Transfer of Property Act, 
1882, suffice it to say that admittedly, the respondent No.1 is a 
subsequent purchaser of the property which had already been 
acquired in the year 2003 and title of the said land had been 
vested in favour of the petitioner and thereafter the vendors / ex-

 
W.P.No.8177/2023 
 
16
owner had no right or title to alienate the same, thus the sale 
transaction in favour of the respondent was void in nature as the 
vendor was not holding any title of the land in question and the 
subsequent vendee has to soar and sink with his vendor and he is 
debarred to claim any better title than that of his vendor. Reliance 
can be placed on the cases titled as Muhammad Yamin and others Vs. 
Settlement Commissioner and others (1976 SCMR 489), Province of 
the Punjab through Collector, Sheikhupura & Others Vs.  Syed 
Ghazanfar   Ali   Shah  &  Others  (2017 SCMR 172) and Abdul 
Hamid Vs. M.B.R. and others (1994 CLC 1160). 
11. 
Furthermore, the award was announced on 24.10.2003 
whereas the respondent No.1 filed application under Section 48 
of the Act ibid before the Commissioner, Lahore Division, 
Lahore on 18.05.2022 i.e. after lapse of about 18 years and no 
convincing reason has been expounded for such an inordinate 
delay, thus the application for de-acquisition was hopelessly 
barred by laches.  
12.  
Nutshell of the above discussion is that the Commissioner, 
Lahore Division, Lahore while passing the impugned order, did 
not consider the law applicable on the case as well as the dictum 
laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan as well as 
that of this Court, thus the impugned order suffers from patent 
illegality, irregularity and without jurisdiction as such the same 
deserves reversal.  
13.  
Resultantly, this writ petition is allowed and order dated 
16.11.2022 passed by the Commissioner, Lahore Division, 
Lahore is hereby set aside.
