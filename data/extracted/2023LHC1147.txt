              Instant constitutional petition stems from order 
dated 07.3.2022 of learned Addl. District Judge in terms 
whereof the revision petition was accepted, order of the 
trial court was set aside and the application for 
consolidation of two suits was allowed. 
2. 
Petitioners instituted a suit titled “Ms. Aila Azhar, 
etc. v. Ali Kuli Amin ud Din” for separate possession 
through partition of land measuring 59 kanals, 19 marlas 
and 113 sq. ft. at Mauza Chandian, Tehsil Shalimar, 
District Lahore.  Respondent No. 1 filed a written 
statement in the petitioners’ suit and also instituted a suit 
titled “Ali Kuli Amin ud Din v. Mst. Aila Azhar” for 
declaration, partition, separate possession, benamidar 
along with permanent and mandatory injunction in respect 
of properties recorded in the plaint. In the course of 
proceedings, an application for consolidation of the two 
suits was filed which was declined by learned Civil Judge 
vide order dated 12.10.2021. In revision the order was set 
aside and application for consolidation was accepted by 
learned Addl. District Judge, Lahore vide order dated 
07.3.2022 which has now been called into question in 
constitutional jurisdiction.

3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that 
the order of the learned Civil Judge dismissing the 
application for consolidation was correct which was not 
open to interference in revisional jurisdiction; that in view 
of the admission in the written statement that the property 
subject-matter of petitioners’ suit for partition, was jointly 
owned, the court ought to have proceeded to pass a decree 
in respect thereof, instead of postponing decree of 
partition till determination of controversy qua properties 
in the respondent’s suit. Adds that the plea of making the 
partition of property in the petitioners’ suit conditional to 
partition of other properties was mala fide and that the 
learned Addl. District Judge proceeded on illegal 
assumption while observing that the consolidation of suits 
was necessary as common issues arose in the two suits 
requiring recording of common evidence despite the fact 
that perusal of the two plaints would reveal that the 
petitioners’ suit was limited to the extent of property 
admittedly joint while respondent’s suit included other 
properties as well in respect whereof question of title had 
been raised on the plea of benami and that consolidation 
of these matters would lead to unnecessary delay and that 
the discretion in this case was not exercised on sound 
judicial principles. Contrariwise learned counsel for the 
respondent supported the impugned order and reiterated 
the reasons as incorporated therein and submitted that 
consolidation of two suits was necessary to save the 
parties from the agony of double round of evidence and 
also the possibility of contradictory decisions. 
4. 
Perusal of the documents appended with this 
petition shows that petitioners filed a suit for separate 
possession through partition in respect of land measuring 
59 kanals, 19 marlas and 113 sq ft at Mauza Chandian, 

W.P.No.21798 of 2022 
 
-3- 
 
Tehsil Shalimar, District Lahore claiming joint ownership 
on the basis of surrender deed dated 24.6.2016. 
Respondent No.1  in the written statement took the 
defense that in addition to the property recorded in the 
plaint other properties were also jointly owned inter se 
that had not been disclosed in the plaint and that all the 
properties should be partitioned so as to allow separate 
possession of their respective shares to the parties. The 
claim was in respect of two sets of properties (i) which 
were jointly held by the parties inclusive of property 
subject matter of petitioners’ partition suit and (ii) the 
other set of properties that were claimed to be in the name 
of petitioner No.2 as benamidar. Respondent No. 1 also 
filed a separate suit for declaration and separate 
possession through partition and injunction in respect of 
all the properties inclusive of the property subject matter 
of petitioners’ suit. An application for consolidation of the 
suits was filed by respondent No.1 which was dismissed 
by the learned Civil Judge vide order dated 12.10.2021. 
Respondent filed a revision petition which was accepted. 
In result, the order of the learned Civil Judge was set aside 
and respondent’s application for consolidation of the two 
suits was allowed. 
5. 
Objection articulated by petitioners’ learned 
counsel at the bar is threefold. First: that there being one 
property subject matter of petitioners’ suit the status of 
which as a joint property having been admitted in the 
written statement, the court ought to have proceeded to 
pass a preliminary decree instead of postponement of its 
partition till the partition of other properties in 
respondent’s suit. Second: that the consolidation of suits 
shall result in prolongation of proceedings in petitioners’ 
suit and that the subsequent suit was nothing but a mala 

W.P.No.21798 of 2022 
 
-4- 
 
fide strategy to impede the partition of the admitted 
property. And three: that the question of title having been 
raised regarding certain properties in petitioner No. 2’s 
name that were alleged to be benami, determination of 
this claim could not deemed to be a condition precedent 
for partition of other properties that were undisputedly 
joint, especially, when the spirit of the Punjab Partition of 
Immovable Property Act, 2012 (Act IV of 2013) as 
encapsulated by its preamble expressed the legislative 
intent towards expeditious partition of immovable 
property. 
6. 
Admittedly the petitioners and respondent No.1 
are siblings. The two petitioners in their plaint only sought 
partition of one property (59 kanals, 19 marlas and 113 sq. 
ft. at Mauza Chandian, Tehsil Shalimar, District Lahore) 
while respondent No.1 instituted a suit for declaration, 
separate possession through partition and injunction in 
respect of all the properties claimed to be joint (inclusive 
of the property in petitioners’ suit) and also claimed title 
in respect of certain other properties in petitioner No.2’s 
name alleged to be benami, demanding their partition by 
treating these as joint as well. It is discernible that same 
defense has been taken in response to petitioners’ suit 
where the respondent claimed that in addition to the 
property disclosed in petitioners’ partition suit, other 
properties were also jointly owned that required partition. 
It is evident from the comparative reading of pleadings in 
the two suits that the subject matter thereof would raise 
common issues. The argument that the suit of the 
petitioners being limited to the one property which was 
admittedly joint therefore it need not be tagged with any 
other properties, is not sound. Under Order XIV, Rules 1 
and 2, C.P.C. issues are framed from the material 

W.P.No.21798 of 2022 
 
-5- 
 
controversies and propositions of law and fact raised in 
the pleadings of parties and are not limited to the issues 
raised in the plaint alone.  Rule 1(5) of Order XIV, C.P.C. 
mandates that on reading the plaint and the written 
statement and after such examination of the parties as may 
appear necessary, the court shall ascertain that upon what 
material propositions of law or fact, the parties are at 
variance; and shall thereupon proceed to frame issues on 
which right decision of the case appears to depend. It is 
clear from bare reading of the provision that the material 
propositions of law or fact raised in the pleadings of the 
parties by both sides (i.e. plaintiffs and defendant) shall 
become subject matter of issues. Perusal of the plaint as 
also the written statement of respondent No. 1 in 
petitioners’ suit would show that the matter inter se is not 
restricted to one joint property alone but extends to other 
properties as well that either are claimed to be joint, or 
which are in the name of one of the petitioners but are 
alleged to be benami and also as such liable to the 
partition process. Deeper examination of the pleadings in 
respondent’s suit also reveals that the issues as are the 
subject matter of petitioners’ suit will also arise in 
respondent’s suit and parties in both the suits are also the 
same. This being so; in situation where parties are the 
same, the subject matter of the two suits raised in the 
pleadings i.e., plaint and written statement is the same, the 
questions for determination of issues will be the same and 
that it will require common evidence for decision; 
propriety demands that the two suits be consolidated to 
follow the rule of convenience for parties and to avoid 
contradictory decisions and unnecessary delay. It appears 
to be in these circumstances that an amendment was made 
in Order II, C.P.C. whereby Rule 6-A was added by 

W.P.No.21798 of 2022 
 
-6- 
 
Lahore High Court Notification No. 237/Legis/XI-Y-26, 
Gazette of Punjab dated 22.8.2018. The newly added Rule 
6-A is under: 
“6-A. Consolidation of suits. Where two or more 
suits or proceedings of the same nature requiring 
determination of similar issues between the same 
parties are pending in relation to the same subject 
matter, the Court may, if considers it expedient for 
avoiding multiplicity of litigation or conflict in 
judgment, direct the consolidation of such suits or 
proceedings as one trial, whereupon all such suits or 
proceedings shall be decided on the basis of the 
consolidated trial”. 
The spirit of the rule supra is that where there are more 
than one suits of the same nature requiring determination 
of common issues inter se the same parties, if the court 
considers it expedient for preclusion of multiplicity of 
litigation or conflicting judgments, it may direct their 
consolidation for adjudication through a single trial. The 
argument that the  jurisdiction of court in the first suit will 
be limited to determination of claim qua one property 
subject matter of plaint and that it should ignore the 
respondent’s version in the written statement, possibly 
cannot be accepted in view of the provisions of Order 
XIV, Rules 1 and 2, C.P.C. which obligate cognizance of 
material propositions of law and fact raised in the 
pleadings of both the plaintiff(s) as well as the 
defendant(s) and their transformation and recording into 
issues for determination of controversy. It obviously 
entails that issues are framed keeping in view version of 
both sides and such exercise is not limited to contents of 
the plaint; separate trials in suchlike cases will lead to 
repetitious exercise of parties to produce same evidence 
and the anomaly of contradictory or inconsistent decisions 
at equivalent level could not be logically excluded which 

W.P.No.21798 of 2022 
 
-7- 
 
eventuality would depart from the policy imperatives 
underlying proper administration of justice.  
7. 
Even otherwise the rule is that partial partition 
shall not be allowed and the entirety of the properties be 
included irrespective of possession. In “Ghulam Rasool 
and others v. Muhammad Khalid and 2 others” (2006 
YLR 2289) it was observed to the effect that the party 
opting to come for partition was not permitted to pick and 
choose and to have the share in the valuable parts of the 
joint property for leaving out its partition with the lesser 
value and that suit for partial partition will not be 
maintainable. Similar view was expressed in “Syed Azhar 
Hussain Shah v. Member Board Of Revenue Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa Province Peshawar and 9 others” (2016 
YLR 1489). Reference can also be made to the rule in 
“Jan Muhammad and another v. Abdur Rashid and 5 
others” (1993 SCMR 1463). From the precedents supra 
the consistent rule drawn appears to be that all the 
properties that are jointly owned must be subject matter of 
the suit, instead of the partition of one property while 
leaving the other 
properties out for 
subsequent 
proceedings. In the present case, the objection of 
petitioners loses significance for the reason that the 
respondent in his written statement, pointed out that the 
parties owned other joint properties which needed to be 
partitioned. Not only this, but respondent also instituted a 
suit to seek partition of the properties which were 
allegedly joint, inclusive of the property that was subject 
matter of the petitioners’ suit. This being so the learned 
Addl. District Judge correctly observed that common 
questions would arise in both the cases which would 
require common evidence and that consolidation of the 
suits will save the possibility of contradictory decisions. It 

W.P.No.21798 of 2022 
 
-8- 
 
was in this backdrop that following the provision of Order 
II, Rule 6-A, C.P.C., the application for consolidation was 
allowed. 
 
8. 
The argument that the impugned order of 
consolidation of two suits is contrary to the rule in “Zahid 
Zaman Khan v. Khan Afsar and others” (PLD 2016 SC 
409) and  “Muhammad Yaqoob v. Behram Khan” (2006 
SCMR 1262) is not well founded. Perusal of the cases 
referred above  reveals that amongst other questions the 
Supreme Court Of Pakistan, while considering the 
question of consolidation of suits, observed to the effect 
that it is an inherent power of the court to consolidate the 
suits and the purpose behind such step is to avoid 
multiplicity of litigation, prevent abuse of process and to 
avoid conflicting judgments and that no hard and fast rule 
forming the basis of consolidation can be sedimented and 
that consolidation depends on the facts and points of law 
involved in each and every case and that  where the court 
is persuaded that the interest of justice demanded this, 
consolidation could be ordered provided no prejudice was 
caused to any litigant and there was no bar in the way of 
courts to consolidate the suits.  
9. 
In “Muhammad Yaqoob v. Behram Khan”  (2006 
SCMR 1262) facts were that two suits were instituted, 
suit for specific performance of contract by one side and 
that for possession, mesne profits and permanent 
injunction by the other side. An application under section 
151, C.P.C. for consolidation of the two suits was filed 
which was dismissed by the learned Civil Judge. In 
revision the order was set aside and the suits were ordered 
to be consolidated, which order was upheld up till the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan. It was observed as follows: 

W.P.No.21798 of 2022 
 
-9- 
 
“3…It is a settled principle of law that where a common 
subject of claim is in dispute in counter-suits, both the 
suits are consolidated and decided together. This rule is 
imperative in order to avoid conflicting decisions. The 
rule was completely ignored by the trial Court as it failed 
to decide the issue in question and committed error to 
stay the proceeding of time respondent’s suit which was 
rightly rectified by the learned High Court with cogent 
reasons in the impugned judgment. It is pertinent to 
mention here that parties in both the suits are the same 
and subject-matter/property is the same. It is well-
settled by a long chain of authorities that the 
consolidation of the suits can be ordered by the Court in 
exercise of its inherent powers. The consent of the 
parties is not the condition precedent for exercise of 
such powers. The purpose of consolidation is to avoid 
multiplicity of litigation of eliminate award of 
contradictory judgments and to prevent the abuse of the 
process of the Court. These purposes are merely 
illustrative and not exhaustive of the powers of the 
Court. There may be other variety of grounds that in the 
interest of justice the Court may be persuaded to 
consolidate the cases. The learned trial Court had 
stayed the proceedings of the suit of the respondent 
without judicial application of mind in violation of the law 
laid down by this Court in various pronouncements …” 
10. 
The learned Civil Judge in the instant case also 
ignored the provision of newly added Rule 6-A of Order 
II, C.P.C. and also the consistent rule on the subject 
referred supra and, as such, the order suffered from 
inherent jurisdictional defect and was rightly corrected in 
revisional jurisdiction by the learned Addl. District Judge, 
vide impugned order. 
11. 
Considering all these facts and  circumstances of 
the present case where the two suits between the parties 
related to the joint properties except part of the property, 
which was claimed to be benami, propriety demands that 
the suits should have been consolidated as common 
questions of law and fact would arise and consolidated 
decision will be required therein. To avoid contradictory 
decisions and also in the interest of justice the proper 
course was to consolidate both the suit i.e., the course as 

W.P.No.21798 of 2022 
 
-10- 
 
adopted by the revisional court, to which no exception can 
be taken. 
12. 
It appears that the main concern of the petitioners’ 
learned counsel was that the property in their suit was 
admittedly joint, there was no issue, the court ought to 
have proceeded to pass a preliminary decree based on the 
admission of the parties. It is observed that not only the 
respondent has made admission in respect of the joint 
property which was subject matter of petitioners’ suit but 
that the petitioners have also made admissions in respect 
of the certain properties subject matter of the suit filed by 
the respondent. No doubt that the trial court is competent 
to pass decree on the basis of admissions made in the 
pleadings under Order XII, Rule 6, C.P.C. which would 
only apply to the properties that are admitted either by the 
petitioners or by the respondent. Reference can be made 
to the case of “G. R. Syed v. Muhammad Afzal” (2007 
SCMR 433) and “Amir Bibi v. Muhammad Khurshid and 
others” (2003 SCMR 1261).  The revisional court was 
cognizant of the rule supra and also took note thereof in 
the impugned order as may be noted from its perusal.  
13. 
The apprehension of delay, as such, expressed by 
learned counsel for the petitioners or of possibility of 
postponement of decision in respect of the admitted 
matters till the determination of other issues, does not 
sound good. Learned counsel appears to have taken the 
stance that the revisional court could have passed a decree 
on the basis of the admissions and in the alternative this 
Court has the jurisdiction to decide the suit in respect of 
admitted facts instead of leaving it for determination of 
the trial court. This request possibly cannot be acceded to 
as neither the revisional court nor this Court could 
preempt the jurisdiction of the trial court. Be that as it 

W.P.No.21798 of 2022 
 
-11- 
 
may, it is observed that the trial court will consider the 
directive of the revisional court and ensure the disposal of 
the matter in respect of the properties that are admittedly 
joint, which aspect has not been opposed by the learned 
counsel for the respondent. Considering that partition 
cases are required to be dealt with and disposed of 
expeditiously the trial court shall, of course, discourage 
every possible attempt of delay and shall ensure that the 
cases are decided in the light of the observations supra on 
merits in accordance with law.    
14.    Instant constitutional petition is disposed of 
accordingly.
