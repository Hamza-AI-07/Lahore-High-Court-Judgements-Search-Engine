ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: 
This Civil Revision is directed 
against the impugned Judgments & Decrees dated 30.01.2013 and 
14.05.2014 passed by Civil Judge, Gujranwala and Additional District 
Judge, Gujranwala, respectively, whereby, suit of Respondent No. 1 
was concurrently decreed.  
2. 
 
The brief facts of this case are that Respondent No. 1 
instituted a suit for specific performance of contract alongwith 
declaration and permanent injunction as consequential relief. It was 
alleged in the plaint that Respondent No. 2 as natural guardian of 
Respondents No. 3 to 8 (the “Minors”) entered into an oral agreement 
to sell with respect to property measuring 10-Kanals and 07-Marlas 
fully described in paragraph No. 2 of the plaint (the “suit property”) 
against total sale consideration of Rs. 300,000/- out of which Rs. 
250,000/- were received by Respondent No. 2 as earnest money. Later, 
with mutual consent, Respondent No. 1 procured stamp papers for 
execution of sale deed and draft sale deed was prepared with sale 
consideration of Rs. 200,000/-. Tax for transfer of the suit property 
was also deposited on 20.05.2006. Respondent No. 2 on behalf of the 
Minors executed sale deed by affixing his signatures and thumb 

2 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 2168 / 2014 
 
 
impressions alongwith witnesses on the draft sale deed and was also 
duly identified. However, draft sale deed dated 23.05.2006 could not 
be registered as the office of Sub-Registrar raised an objection that 
Respondent No. 2 should procure a guardianship certificate on behalf 
of the Minors before attesting the sale deed. Respondent No. 2 
promised to procure guardianship certificate and as such, registration 
of sale deed was postponed. Subsequently, Respondent No. 1 came to 
know that Respondent No. 2 sold the suit property to the Petitioner 
(who died during pendency of the titled Petition and is now 
represented by his legal heirs) through registered sale deed No. 60 
dated 19.08.2006 which is fraudulent, unlawful, without consideration 
and ineffective qua the rights of Respondent No. 1. It was further 
alleged by Respondent No. 1 that he is always willing and ready to 
perform his part of contract and has called upon the Petitioner and 
Respondent No. 2 along with the Minors to get cancel the sale deed 
executed in favour of the Petitioner and register sale deed in his favour 
but they refused to do so. Hence, the suit.   
3. 
 
Two written statements are on record. The first written 
statement is dated 10.01.2007 allegedly submitted by Respondent No. 
2 singly signed by him through his Advocate, namely, Ch. Masood 
Hanjra. The said written statement which is not verified on oath is a 
conceding written statement in which Respondent No. 2 admitted all 
the contents of the plaint and stated that the Petitioner accompanied 
Respondent No. 2 to Tehsil Office for procuring guardianship 
certificate but fraudulently got registered sale deed in his favour. 
4. 
 
The second written statement dated 13.01.2007 verified 
on oath was filed by Respondent No. 2 for himself and for the Minors 
in which the contents of the plaint were categorically denied. It was 
stated therein that Respondent No. 2 as natural guardian of the Minors 
sold the suit property to the Petitioner for total sale consideration of 
Rs. 500,000/- and got registered sale deed No. 60 dated 19.08.2006 in 
his favour after receiving total sale consideration and also delivered 
possession to the Petitioner who is now owner in possession of the suit 
property. It was also specifically asserted in paragraph No. 7 of the 

3 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 2168 / 2014 
 
 
written statement that Respondent No. 1 fraudulently filed the first 
conceding written statement dated 10.01.2007 in the Court with his 
fake signatures and power of attorney which is liable to be cancelled 
and FIR may be ordered to be registered against him.  
5. 
 
It was importantly noted in the second written statement 
that one of the Minors, namely, Shahzad Ali has died and as such, 
written statement is being filed by Respondent No. 2 for himself and 
on behalf of the Minors excluding the deceased minor. Consequently, 
amended plaint dated 27.11.2012 was filed by Respondent No. 1 
followed by amended written statement dated 21.12.2012 submitted 
jointly by Respondent No. 2 alongwith the Minors and the Petitioner in 
line with the second contesting written statement. The wife of 
Respondent No. 2, present Respondent No. 2A got added as a party in 
her capacity as legal heir of deceased minor.  
6. 
 
Out of divergent pleadings of the parties, the Trial Court 
framed the following issues:- 
i. 
Whether the plaintiff being owner of the suit 
property is entitled to get the relief asked for? OPP 
ii. 
Whether the agreement dated 23.05.2006 exists 
between the parties? OPP  
iii. 
Whether the defendant No.1 to 7 has received 
Rs.2,00000/- from the plaintiff? OPP 
iv. 
Whether the plaintiff has not come to the court with 
clean hands and suit of the plaintiff has no cause of 
action to file the instant suit? OPD 
v. 
Whether the suit is false and frivolous and the 
defendant is entitled to recover special costs u/s 35-
A CPC? OPD 
vi. 
Whether the suit is liable to be dismissed in view of 
the preliminary objections raised by the defendant? 
OPD 
vii. 
Relief. 
 
7. 
 
Evidence of the parties was recorded by the Trial Court. 
After scanning the evidence on record, the Trial Court decreed the suit 
of Respondent No. 1 in the following terms:-  
“In the light of my findings on issues No. 1, 2, & 3 the 
result is that plaintiff has partly established his case, I 
therefore grant him decree for specific performance of 
agreement to sell i.e. 20.05.2006 defendant No.7 (wrongly 
recorded instead of defendant No. 1) is directed to receive 
balance amount of Rs.50,000/- and defendant No.1 is 

4 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 2168 / 2014 
 
 
further directed to get register sale deed in favour of the 
plaintiff subject to taking guardianship certificate of 
minors defendants No. 2 to 7. The impugned sale deed 
No.60 dated 19.07.2006 (wrongly recorded instead of 
19.08.2006) is also declared against the law and fact. 
Decree for permanent injunction is also granted to the 
effect that defendant be restrained from alienating suit 
property further. The parties are left to bear their own 
costs. Decree sheet be drawn accordingly. File be 
consigned to the record room after its due completion.” 
 
8. 
 
The Petitioner filed an Appeal against the decision of the 
Trial Court which was dismissed and the Judgment of the Trial Court 
was upheld. Hence, this Civil Revision.  
9. 
 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the 
impugned Judgments are not sustainable for the reasons that no date, 
time, place or particulars of the oral sale transaction were mentioned 
by Respondent No. 1 in his plaint in violation of law laid down in case 
titled, “Saddaruddin (since deceased) through LRs. v. Sultan Khan 
(since deceased) through LRs and others” (2021 SCMR 642); oral 
evidence of the PWs was contradictory and discrepant with respect to 
particulars of oral agreement and payment of earnest money; the 
alleged draft of sale deed (Exh.P1) is dated 20.05.2006, whereas, the 
date of stamp papers is recorded as 22.04.2006 and that of registry 
muharar is listed as 23.05.2006 which if read together prove that draft 
sale deed is fictitious; no stamp vendor or revenue official was 
produced; the particulars of oral transaction were not independently 
proved through production of witnesses in terms of Articles 17 and 79 
of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984; and the Petitioner is entitled to 
protection as a bona fide purchaser of suit property for valuable 
consideration without notice. Reliance is place on case titled, 
“Muhammad Yousaf v. Allah Ditta and others” (2021 SCMR 1241). 
10. 
 
Conversely, learned counsel for Respondent No. 1 
supported the impugned Judgments and submitted that Respondent No. 
1 proved the oral transaction through the executed draft sale deed by 
producing its two marginal witnesses who testified the oral transaction 
as well as the execution of the draft sale deed, the registration of which 
was merely postponed for want of guardianship certificate coupled 

5 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 2168 / 2014 
 
 
with the admissions of Respondent No. 2 on record. As such, the 
concurrent Judgments rendered by the Courts below did not require 
any interference by this Court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction.  
11. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
12. 
 
Issues No. 2 and 3 were pivotal for Respondent No. 1 as 
Plaintiff to establish the veracity of his assertions raised in the plaint. 
The statement of Respondent No. 1 appearing as PW-1 clearly depicts 
that oral transaction was agreed on a date prior to the preparation of 
the alleged draft sale deed (Exh.P1) as balance sale consideration was 
to be paid at the time of execution of sale deed. During his cross-
examination, he acknowledged that the sale transaction with 
Respondent No. 2 was oral and no sale deed was registered in his 
favour. He also admitted that he does not have any claim with respect 
to his transaction against the Petitioner. He further stated that he paid 
Rs. 250,000/- to Respondent No. 2 on 20.05.2006 at Dera of 
Muhammad Ali between 10.00 to 11.00 A.M. but did not obtain any 
receipt against the said payment. He also deposed that on the day of 
payment of earnest money, he went with Respondent No. 2 for 
registration of sale deed with Muhammad Ali (PW-2) and Muhammad 
Iqbal (PW-3). PW-2 in his examination-in-chief supported the version 
of Respondent No. 1 taken in the plaint but contradicted him in his 
cross-examination by deposing that he does not remember the date and 
time of payment of earnest money since the transaction was oral. He 
further contradicted Respondent No. 1 by stating that they went for 
registration of sale deed three to four days after oral transaction. 
Similarly, PW-3 contradicted PW-1 and PW-2 in his cross-
examination by deposing that he does not remember the date of oral 
transaction but the same was executed five to ten days before going to 
the office of Sub-Registrar. None of the witnesses deposed anything to 
the effect that the Petitioner is not a bona fide purchaser for value 
without notice or the sale deed registered by Respondent No. 2 and the 
Minors in his favour is fraudulent or without consideration. Rather, 
they acknowledged that the Petitioner is in possession of suit property 
after the registration of sale deed in his favour.  

6 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 2168 / 2014 
 
 
13. 
 
Exh.P1 is a draft of sale deed which ostensibly carries 
thumb impressions and signatures of PW-1 and PW-2 as witnesses 
alongwith Respondents No. 1 & 2 as vendee and vendor, respectively 
but its contents reveal that entire sale consideration of Rs. 200,000/-  
has been received at home in contrast to alleged oral transaction. The 
document is dated 20.05.2006, the date of stamp papers is listed as 
22.04.2006 and that of the stamp of registry muharar is recorded as 
23.05.2006 which if taken as a whole contradict the oral version of 
Respondent No. 1 in the plaint especially when the plaint did not 
reveal any particulars of sale transaction such as date, time, place and 
names of the witnesses. The stamp papers are statedly got issued by 
Respondent No. 2 negating the narration in the plaint to this effect. 
Respondent No. 1 also produced Exh.P3, the registered sale deed 
between the Petitioner and Respondent No. 2 acting on behalf of the 
Minors as natural guardian. 
14. 
 
Respondent No. 2 appeared in the witness box as DW-1 
and deposed in line with his version taken in the second written 
statement and in his cross-examination specifically deposed that 
neither he filed the first conceding written statement nor signed it or 
appointed Advocate, namely, Ch. Masood Hanjra as his counsel. In his 
cross-examination, he stated that land sold to Respondent No. 1 is a 
separate property than the suit property regarding which he effected 
registry in his favour and that Respondent No. 1 got his thumb 
impressions on the draft sale deed through fraud as he is an uneducated 
person. The Petitioner as DW-2 endorsed the veracity of sale deed 
registered in his favour against complete sale consideration. While 
denying a suggestion, he deposed that he is a bona fide purchaser of 
suit property for valuable consideration without notice. 
15. 
 
Before drawing conclusions, it is important to mention 
some pertinent facts which are liable to be considered. When 
Respondent No. 1 moved an application for comparison of thumb 
impressions and signatures of Respondent No. 2 on Exh.P1, the latter 
on 29.11.2012, recorded his statement before the Trial Court admitting 
his signatures and thumb impressions yet resiled from the said 

7 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 2168 / 2014 
 
 
statement when he was put to cross-examination by learned counsel 
for the Petitioner. It is also noted that during the pendency of Appeal, 
Respondent No. 2 himself and on behalf of the Minors got recorded his 
statement on 08.06.2013 to the effect that he has no objection if the 
Appeal of the Petitioner is allowed. On 29.03.2014, counsel for 
Respondents No. 2 to 8 alongwith Shahbaz Begum w/o Respondent 
No. 2 (present Respondent No. 2A) also recorded statement that she 
has no objection in case the Appeal of the Petitioner is allowed. 
Nevertheless, the Courts below were persuaded by the statement dated 
29.11.2012 of Respondent No. 2 coupled with conceding written 
statement on record to hold that the same amounted to admission on 
the part of Respondent No. 2 with respect to the alleged oral 
transaction of Respondent No. 1 and as such, noted that contradictory 
stance of Respondent No. 2 is not worth consideration.  
16. 
 
Record vividly reflects that Respondent No. 1 as Plaintiff 
did not list the particulars of oral transaction in the plaint and as such 
did not independently prove the oral transaction. The evidence qua oral 
sale transaction of Respondent No. 1 was not only beyond pleadings 
but was also discrepant and contradictory particularly with respect to 
details of oral transaction and receipt of earnest money by Respondent 
No. 2 on behalf of the Minors. No stamp vendor was produced to 
prove the procurement of stamp papers for the alleged draft sale deed 
(Ex.P1). No revenue official was produced with respect to alleged 
objection of concerned Sub-Registrar denying registration of sale deed 
in favour of Respondent No. 1 without guardianship certificate in 
favour of Respondent No. 2 regarding the Minors. Admittedly, sale 
deed in favour of the Petitioner by Respondent No. 2 was executed and 
registered as natural guardian of the Minors and there is no explanation 
to the effect that if the same could be registered why draft sale deed in 
favour of Respondent No. 1 was declined. There is no evidence that 
alleged witnesses of the draft sale deed were also witnesses of oral 
transaction. No target date was alleged with respect to the oral sale 
transaction. No effort was made to deposit balance sale consideration 
in Court which admittedly had not been paid till the decision of the suit 

8 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 2168 / 2014 
 
 
to demonstrate the readiness and willingness on the part of Respondent 
No. 1 to perform his part of the oral contract and his financial ability to 
discharge his obligation. As such, Respondent No. 1 could not prove 
oral sale transaction as alleged in the plaint.   
17. 
 
The first conceding written statement is dated 10.01.2007 
while the second contesting written statement is dated 13.01.2007 with 
a difference of only three days. The second written statement pointed 
out the death of a minor which fact would naturally be known to 
Respondent No. 2. Further, the first written statement is not verified on 
oath unlike the second written statement. Respondent No. 2 while 
submitting second contesting written statement had specifically stated 
that the first conceding written statement is neither filed or signed by 
him nor he appointed the alleged Advocate or executed any power of 
attorney in this behalf. He specifically prayed that the same be struck 
off. As such, the Court impliedly accepted the plea of Respondent No. 
2 as it proceeded to frame issues and recorded evidence of the parties. 
Hence, subsequent reliance by the Courts below on the first conceding 
written statement and interpreting the same as constituting admission 
of Respondent No. 2 against the claim of Respondent No. 1 was 
unwarranted. The referred conceding statement of Respondent No. 2 
dated 29.11.2012 acknowledging his signatures and thumb impressions 
on draft sale deed was resiled by him and as such, the same could not 
have been made basis for accepting the claim of Respondent No. 1 
when the latter had failed to establish his claim on the basis of his own 
evidence especially when conceding statements dated 08.06.2013 and 
29.03.2014 made before the Appellate Court by Respondent No. 2 for 
himself and on behalf of the Minors and by wife of Respondent No. 2 
(Respondent No. 2-A in the titled Civil Revision) in favour of the 
Petitioner are also on record.  
18. 
 
The PWs had categorically admitted the claim of the 
Petitioner that sale deed was executed by Respondent No. 2 in favour 
of the Petitioner and that the latter was in possession of the suit 
property. Respondent No. 1 did not specifically claim in the plaint nor 
produced any evidence to prove that the Petitioner was not a bona fide 

9 
 
 
 
 
C. R. No. 2168 / 2014 
 
 
purchaser for value or had prior knowledge of oral sale transaction 
between Respondents No. 1 and 2. In contrast, the Petitioner had 
emphatically denied the suggestion that he had any prior knowledge of 
the said alleged oral sale transaction. Overwhelming evidence is on 
record, whereby, Respondent No. 2 admitted to have executed a 
registered sale deed in favour of the Petitioner after receiving entire 
sale consideration. As such, there is no occasion not to give preference 
to a valid and lawfully registered subsequent sale deed over an 
unproved oral sale transaction. Hence, the Petitioner as bona fide 
purchaser for valuable consideration without notice was entitled to the 
protection accorded to him by Section 41 of the Transfer of Property 
Act, 1882 and Section 27(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1877. Thus, the 
impugned Judgments being result of misreading and non-reading of 
evidence on record as well as misapplication of law cannot be 
sustained.     
19. 
 
In view of the above, this Civil Revision is allowed; the 
impugned Judgments & Decrees dated 30.01.2013 and 14.05.2014 
passed by the Courts below are set aside and in consequence thereof, 
the suit of Respondent No. 1 is dismissed. No order as to costs.
