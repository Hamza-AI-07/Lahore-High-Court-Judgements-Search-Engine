Mr. Asad Ali Bajwa, D.A.G. 
 
Shahid Karim, J:-. This is a reference application under 
Section 133 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (“the 
Ordinance”) and brings a challenge to the order dated 
12.05.2022 passed by the Appellate Tribunal Inland 
Revenue.  The following questions of law have been 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
2 
 
framed for the opinion of this Court and which are 
crucial for the decision of the controversy involved: 
1. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the 
case, the learned Tribunal has not misinterpreted the 
subsidy granted by the Federal Government for 
taxpayer’s consumer not effecting the supply/ sales of 
taxpayer required to be added in the turnover u/s 113 
of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001? 
2. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, 
the learned Tribunal was justified to hold that the 
subsidy cannot be added as turnover for the purposes 
of charging of tax u/s 113 of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001? 
3. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the 
case the learned Tribunal has not misinterpreted the 
subsidy in question which is exempt from levy of tax 
under clause 102-A of the Part I of the 2nd Schedule to 
the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 but cannot be 
excluded from the turnover under Section 113 of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001?” 
2. 
This judgment will also decide connected 
reference applications ITR Nos.146 of 2016, 196 of 
2016, 41 of 2017, 82911 of 2017, 82915 of 2017, 82919 
of 2017, 42 of 2017, 75743 of 2021, 75744 of 2021, 
75745 of 2021, 75746 of 2021,75747 of 2021, 75748 of 
2021 and 75749 of 2021, ITR Nos.74708 of 2017, 74710 
of 2017, 14763 of 2023, 14774 of 2023, 59530 of 2023, 
76238 of 2023, 76250 of 2023.  Some of the tax 
references have been filed by the department while 
others have been filed by the distribution companies 
(Discos).  This was necessitated because Benches of the 
Tribunal have rendered conflicting judgments on the 
same issue of law. 
3. 
It is common ground between the parties that the 
respondents/taxpayers are public limited companies 
engaged in the business of distribution of electricity 
(Discos).  Deeming assessment under Section 120 of the 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
3 
 
Ordinance was found erroneous in so far as prejudicial 
to the interest of revenue and hence an order under 
Section 122(5A) of the Ordinance was passed charging 
minimum tax under Section 113 of the Ordinance.  This 
was done by inclusion of subsidy granted by the Federal 
Government in other income as part of the turnover of 
the Discos thereby making an apportionment under 
Section 67 of the Ordinance.  The Discos contended 
before the Assessing Officer that Tariff Differential 
Subsidy (TDS) was a relief provided by Federal 
Government to different categories of consumers of 
electricity by notifying reduced rates of electricity.  It is 
undisputed that TDS is contributed by Federal 
Government and on that account reduced tariff is 
notified for certain consumers to provide financial 
support and in fact no actual sale is made by the Discos 
to the Government.  With the exclusion of TDS from 
sales, Discos contend that they are incurring gross losses 
and therefore subsidy cannot be made a charge of 
minimum tax.  In sum, Discos submit that minimum tax 
under Section 113 of the Ordinance is chargeable on the 
amount billed and received from the consumers of 
electricity while the amount received as subsidy 
provided by the Federal Government to distribution 
companies was not chargeable to minimum tax. 
4. 
The controversy turns on the true construction of 
the term ‘turnover’ as defined in section 113 (3) of the 
Ordinance which provides that: 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
4 
 
“113. Minimum tax on the income of certain 
persons.- (1) This section shall apply to a resident 
company, permanent establishment of a non-resident 
company, an individual (having turnover of hundred 
million rupees or above in the tax year 2017 or in any 
subsequent tax year) and an association of persons 
(having turnover of hundred million rupees or above 
in the tax year 2017 or in any subsequent tax year) 
where, for any reason whatsoever allowed under this 
Ordinance, including any other law for the time being 
in force —  
(a) loss for the year;  
(b) the setting off of a loss of an earlier year; 
(c) exemption from tax; 
(d) the application of credits or rebates; or 
(e) the claiming of allowances or deductions 
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) 
no tax is payable or paid by the person for a tax year 
or the tax payable or paid by the person for a tax year 
is less than the percentage as specified in column (3) 
of the Table in Division IX of Part-I of the First 
Schedule of the amount representing the person’s 
turnover from all sources for that year: 
(2) Where this section applies: 
(a) the aggregate of the person’s turnover as defined 
in sub-section (3) for the tax year shall be treated as 
the income of the person for the year chargeable to 
tax. 
(b) the person shall pay as income tax for the tax year 
(instead of the actual tax payable under this 
Ordinance), minimum tax computed on the basis of 
rates as specified in Division IX of Part I of First 
Schedule; 
(c) where tax paid under sub-section (1) exceeds the 
actual tax payable under Part I, clause (1) of Division 
I, or  Division II of the First Schedule, the excess 
amount of tax paid shall be carried forward for 
adjustment against tax liability under the aforesaid 
Part of the subsequent tax year: 
Provided that if tax is paid under sub-section (1) due 
to the fact that no tax is payable or paid for the year, 
the entire amount of tax paid under sub-section (1) 
shall be carried forward for adjustment in the manner 
stated aforesaid:  
Provided further that the amount under this clause 
shall be carried forward and adjusted against tax 
liability for three tax years immediately succeeding 
the tax year for which the amount was paid. 
(3) “turnover” means,- 
(a) the gross sales or gross receipts, exclusive of 
Sales Tax and Federal Excise duty or any trade 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
5 
 
discounts shown on invoices, or bills, derived from 
the sale of goods, and also excluding any amount 
taken as deemed income and is assessed as final 
discharge of the tax liability for which tax is already 
paid or payable; 
(b) the gross fees for the rendering of services for 
giving 
benefits 
including 
commissions; 
except 
covered by final discharge of tax liability for which 
tax is separately paid or payable; 
(c) the gross receipts from the execution of contracts; 
except covered by final discharge of tax liability for 
which tax is separately paid or payable; and 
(d) the company’s share of the amounts stated above 
of any association of persons of which the company is 
a member.” 
5. 
Section 113 of the Ordinance is a regime of 
taxation based on minimum tax on the income of certain 
persons.  It is triggered under circumstances mentioned 
in section 113 and applies to a resident company, 
permanent establishment of a non-resident company, an 
individual having turnover of 300 Million rupees or 
above in the tax year etc.  The parties do not quarrel that 
Discos which are before this Court in the present cases 
are being charged minimum tax on their incomes.  Sub-
section (2) provides the formulae for classification of the 
income of a person who is caught by the provisions of 
section 113.  It states that the aggregate of the person’s 
turnover as defined in Sub-section (3) for the tax year 
shall be treated as the income of the person for the year 
chargeable to tax. 
6. 
We now turn to the definition of the term 
‘turnover’ which has been set out above.  Clause (a) of 
Sub-section (3) is the relevant clause for our purposes in 
order to arrive at a just decision in the present cases.  

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
6 
 
According to that definition turnover means the gross 
sales or gross receipts exclusive of sales tax and federal 
excise duty or any trade discounts shown on invoices or 
bills derived from the sale of goods and also excluding 
any amount taken as deemed income.  The case of 
Discos is that it is crucial for the determination of 
turnover that there should be gross receipts derived 
from the sale of goods.  It ineluctably follows that there 
has to be sale of goods from which the gross receipts are 
derived and unless it is shown that there has been an 
actual sales of goods, no income can be included in the 
term ‘turnover’ as defined in section 113 (3)(a) of the 
Ordinance.   
7. 
In order to determine the real controversy, the 
backcloth of the transaction has to be analysed in its 
proper perspective.  The determination of tariff of 
electricity is made by National Electric Power 
Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) which does so by its 
decision in the official gazette.  The decision which 
forms the background of the present cases was made by 
NEPRA on 27.05.2022 pursuant to Sub-section (7) of 
Section 
31 
of 
the 
Regulations 
of 
Generation, 
Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power Act, 
1997 (“the 1997 Act”).  NEPRA modified the decision 
of the Authority in the matter of Motion filed by the 
Federal Government under Sections 7 and 31 of the 
1997 Act read with rule 17 of the NEPRA (Tariff, 
Standards and Procedure) Rules, 1998 with respect to 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
7 
 
recommendations of the consumer-end-tariff for Discos 
and K-Electric.  That decision gives a background of 
determination of tariffs for Discos for the financial year 
2018-19 and financial year 2019-20 individually under 
the single year tariff regime for both their distribution 
and 
supply 
functions 
separately. 
 
The 
tariff 
determinations/ decisions were forwarded to the Federal 
Government for notification under Section 31(7) of the 
1997 Act.  In response, the Federal Government in its 
letter dated 21.01.2021 submitted a Motion for 
recommendation of consumer-end-tariff for the Discos 
which was decided by the Authority vide decision dated 
12.02.2021.  Subsequently, the Federal Government vide 
letter dated 15.10.2021 submitted another Motion with 
respect to recommendations of consumer-end-tariff for 
the Discos and the underlying intention for doing so was 
encapsulated in the Motion in the following terms: 
i. 
Economic Co-Ordination Committee (ECC), 
vide its decision dated October 24, 2018 approved the 
Methodology for arriving at Uniform Tariff and its 
Adjustment, which was, thereafter, approved and 
ratified by the Cabinet. Furthermore, to structure the 
discretion for arriving at such uniform tariff, further 
appropriate guidelines were also adopted, which be 
read as an integral part of this request. 
v. 
Based 
on 
the 
consolidated 
revenue 
requirements of DISCOs as well as the economic and 
financial policy of the Federal Government, the tariff 
differential subsidy (TDS) is proposed to be modified 
and reduced. This modification in the targeted 
subsidy is proposed to be given effect along-with 
modification of inter disco tariff rationalization/cross 
subsidies per practice in vogue, through modification 
of the applicable variable charge of categories of 
consumers of XWDISCOs. The same has been 
approved by the Federal Government and is 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
8 
 
submitted to the Authority for consideration in terms 
of section 31(4) of the Act. This modification is not 
aimed at raising any revenues for the Federal 
Government, as it is within the determined revenue 
requirements of the SWDISCOs, as consolidated and 
determined by the Authority in the terms of section 
31(4) of the Act. 
vii. 
In light of the above, the instant Motion has 
been filed by the Federal Government with respect to 
Consumer End Tariff Recommendations under section 
7, 31(4) and 31(7) of the Act read with Rule 17 of the 
NEPRA Tariff (Standards and Procedures) Rules, 
1998 
so 
as 
to 
reconsider 
and 
issue 
the 
revised/modified uniform schedule of tariff of 
XWDISCOs, by incorporating revised subsidy and 
inter 
distribution 
companies 
tariff 
rationalization/cross subsidies for the category of 
each of NEPRA determined notified rate (inclusive of 
subsidy/cross 
subsidies/inter 
disco 
tariff 
rationalization) in SRO Nos.01 to 10 of 2019 dated 
January 01, 2019 as modified by SROs 182 to 
191(I)/2021 dated February 12, 2021 and 1280 to 
1289(I)/2021 dated October 01, 2021.” 
8. 
The Motion was triggered by the decision of the 
Economic 
Coordination 
Committee 
(ECC) 
dated 
October 24, 2018 which approved the modification for 
arriving at uniformity of tariff and its adjustment.  
Consequently, after accounting for tariff rationalization, 
tariff differential subsidy and cross subsidies, such 
amendments/ modification were to result in net required 
subsidy to the tune of Rs.240 Billion to various 
categories of consumers.  Based on the consolidated 
revenue requirements of Discos, TDC was proposed to 
be modified and reduced.  It is necessary to bear in mind 
that the modification was not aimed at raising any 
revenue for the Federal Government as it was within the 
determined revenue requirements of the Discos as 
consolidated and determined by the Authority. 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
9 
 
9. 
The decision clearly envisaged the intention of 
the Government to allow targeted subsidies and recover 
the cost of electricity.  Upon examination of the 
pleadings made in the Motion and the available record 
with the Authority, determination and order was made in 
the matter.  In conclusion, the following decision was 
made by approving the revised applicable tariff as 
proposed by the Federal Government (the Decision): 
“23. 
The Authority also understands that the proposed 
tariff by the Federal Government is also within the 
overall 
revenue 
requirement 
of 
DISCOs 
as 
determined by the Authority. 
24. 
In view of the discussion made in the preceding 
paragraphs, the Authority has indicated the revised 
applicable tariff as proposed by the Federal 
Government, which is attached herewith as Annex-A, 
B and C. The same shall replace the already issued 
Annex A, B and C, attached with the decision of the 
Authority dated 23.09.2021 in the matter of Policy 
Guidelines by the MoE for providing basis for 
retargeting of power sector subsidies. In addition, an 
Annex-D i.e. SoT without incorporating the impact of 
PYA has been attached, which shall become 
applicable w.e.f. 12.02.2022.” 
10. 
It is clear that the Motion of the Federal 
Government as approved by the Authority gave rise to a 
structure whereby the Federal Government subsidized 
the rate of electricity tariff in respect of certain 
categories 
of 
consumers. 
 
According 
to 
that 
arrangement, the consumers were billed at a certain rate 
by the Discos whereas the rest of the amount was to be 
reimbursed by the Federal Government in the accounts 
of the Discos.  It must be emphasized and this has also 
been noted in the decision of the Authority that the 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
10 
 
ultimate goal of the Government to allow targeted 
subsidies was to recover the cost of electricity as also 
that the modification for the targeted subsidy and the 
consequent modification and rationalization of tariff 
determination was within the determined revenue 
requirements of the Discos.  The decision of the 
Authority merely incorporated the revised subsidy 
proposed by the Government and proceeded to effect 
inter-Disco tariff rationalization/ cross subsidies for the 
category of each NEPRA determined modified rate 
(inclusive of subsidy/ gross subsidies/ inter Disco tariff 
rationalization).  We have no reason to believe that 
Discos were burdened with modified rates of tariff 
which were to be recovered from the consumers.  The 
revised / modified uniform schedule of tariff determined 
by NEPRA merely factored in the subsidy/ cross subsidy 
which was to be restituted by the Federal Government in 
favour of Discos.  Thus, Discos charged certain portion 
of the tariff from the consumers whereas the other 
portion of the tariff as determined by NEPRA was 
reimbursed by the Federal Government into the accounts 
of Discos.  At the end of it, Discos did not suffer a 
diminution of their income which was made up of two 
different streams. 
11. 
The learned counsel for Discos emphasized 
during the oral arguments that gross receipts have to be 
derived from the sale of goods whereas in the case of the 
portion which is reimbursed by the Federal Government, 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
11 
 
there is no sale of goods.  This is an erroneous view and 
is based on a misconstruction of the entire transaction 
brought 
forth 
above. 
 
Doubtless, 
the 
Federal 
Government is a necessary party to the entire 
architecture under which tariff determination is made by 
the Authority and it is on the Motion of the Federal 
Government that subsidy is given to the consumers.  On 
that basis, there is indeed a sale of goods in favour of the 
consumers.  The only difference is that the moneys 
recovered in respect of sale of goods come from two 
different sources in the present cases.  Since the 
transaction is unique, this Court will have to view the 
term ‘sale of goods’ in the peculiar context and setting 
of the entire transaction which has been set out above.  
To reiterate, subsidy is not given by the Federal 
Government in favour of the Discos but is handed out to 
the consumers.  Secondly, there is indeed sale of goods 
which takes place and Discos accumulate gross receipts 
as well which as stated above comprise of two different 
sources.  The Decision of NEPRA contained a 
reiteration of the proposed increase in tariff being 
“within the overall revenue requirement determined by 
NEPRA”, and that “the ultimate goal of the Government 
is to allow targeted subsidies and recover the cost of 
electricity.”  The Government was thus very clear that 
there was a cost for production of electricity which must 
be recovered.  Since it cannot be done entirely from the 
consumers, the burden has to be shared by the 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
12 
 
Government.  Yet, the overall revenue requirement of 
Discos must not be adversely impacted, thereby. 
12. 
It is an undeniable fact that sale of goods takes 
place to the consumers and important aspect of the term 
‘turnover’ as defined in section 113(3)(a) of the 
Ordinance is for the sale of goods to take place from 
which gross receipts are derived.  It does not constrain 
the sources from which those receipts will be derived 
which may be one or multiple sources.  Discos’ 
misplaced notion that there is in fact no sale to Federal 
Government has no basis.  No sale need take place to the 
Federal Government and it is enough if it is done to the 
consumers.  The rest is a matter of receipt of money in 
respect of the transaction of sale which has already taken 
place.  The evasion of tax on this basis would be 
tantamount to distortion of the concept of subsidy which 
is a matter between the consumers and the Federal 
Government.   
13. 
This is also borne out from the audited accounts 
placed on record upon the directions of this Court by the 
parties.  For example, in respect of GEPCO, it has 
clearly been stated under the heading ‘financial revenue’ 
that “the tariff differential subsidy worth Rs.28,477 
Million 
is 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
tariff 
determined by NEPRA and the tariff notified by 
GoP".  Further, under the profit and loss account 
heading the total revenue of GEPCO includes revenue 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
13 
 
from sales of electricity as well as subsidy from GoP.  It 
barely covers the cost of electricity which is calculated 
at Rs.110.311M as compared to total revenue of 
Rs.122.135M (for 2017-18).  Thus, the audited accounts 
of Discos clearly show the subsidy from Government of 
Pakistan as part of the revenue receipts.  Similar is the 
case of LESCO which shows the tariff differential 
subsidy as receivable from the Government of Pakistan.  
This amount has also been included in the revenue 
receipts of LESCO.  These documents which are the 
documents of the Discos leave it in no manner of doubt 
that the amount of subsidy has been shown as a revenue 
receipt in the audited accounts.  Although it has been 
mentioned as a subsidy to be reimbursed by the Federal 
Government, there is no doubt that it forms part of the 
gross receipts of the Discos derived from sale of goods.  
The use of term ‘subsidy’ is notional in our opinion as 
subsidy is merely in favour of the consumers and Discos 
derive no benefit out of that subsidy.  They are in fact 
recompensed fully on account of the tariff determined by 
NEPRA. 
14. 
Similar question came up for hearing before the 
High Court of Sindh in inter alia Income Tax Case 
No.10 to 89 which was decided on 28.09.2023 and the 
question of law was determined in the following 
manner: 
“18. 
In essence, the law is that if the payments 
received are voluntary without there being any legal 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
14 
 
obligation upon them to do so, or without there being 
any liability or obligation to that effect, then in a 
certain set of facts, it can be held to be anything other 
than an income.  It could be a capital receipt or 
against any share consideration.  In the present case 
it is not so.  In judging the nature of a receipt, the 
Courts 
have 
to 
take 
into 
account 
all 
the 
circumstances under which the taxpayer may have 
received the money particularly the purpose for which 
it was given to the taxpayer.  In the instant matter the 
payment by the government was thus specifically for 
the purpose of covering losses and it was for that very 
purpose that the subsidy had been demanded by the 
taxpayer; consequently, this amount received was a 
trading receipt and must be held to be income arising 
from the business of the taxpayer so that it is taxable 
as such.  The payment was no doubt called a subsidy, 
but it is clear that it was made specifically with the 
object of compensating the taxpayer for the loss of 
certain profits which might have arisen if the cotton 
was not purchased on the price as directed by the 
Government.  This was, therefore an income or 
receipt by the company which was inseparably 
connected with the conduct of the business of the 
company and it arose from that business.” 
15. 
Similarly, the Balochistan High Court was also 
confronted with the issue of law in the following terms: 
“1) 
Whether on the facts and circumstances of the 
case Appellate Tribunal has erred in holding that the 
subsidy cannot be made part of turnover as defined in 
Section 113 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001? 
2) 
Whether the “Tariff Differential Subsidy” 
paid by the government to the taxpayer is in lieu of 
consideration for sale of electricity to the consumer at 
the rate below the fixed tariff for such sale?” 
In a judgment reported as CIR v. M/s QESCO 
(2022 PTD 1844), the question was resolved in favour 
of the department and the following observations are 
relevant for our purposes: 
“15. 
Minimum tax is charged as a percentage of 
total turnover. The term "turnover" is defined as 
gross receipts from sale of goods, rendering of 
services and execution of contracts. However the 
Sales Tax, Federal Excise Duty, trade discount 
mentioned on invoices and presumptive or final tax 
regime income are to be excluded from the gross 
receipts. In the instant reference the taxpayer is 
engaged into business of sale of electricity to 
domestic, commercial and industrial consumers. 

 
ITR No.73049 of 2022 
15 
 
The slabs and rate are determined by the NEPRA. 
In certain case lesser rates are charged from 
specific categories of consumers. The electricity 
supply companies receive certain portion of price 
of electricity from consumers which is lower than 
the NEPRA Tariff and the balance is received from 
the Government in the form of TDS. Thus the TDS 
is meant for relief to the end consumers. These 
electric supply companies declare in their audited 
accounts both the receipts from the consumers and 
the Government…” 
16. 
From the above it is clear that TDS is 
amount receivable from the Government of 
Pakistan on account of difference between lower 
than NEPRA Tariff price charged from the 
consumers and the price notified by the NEPRA. 
Thus is not a subsidy or grant given to the QESCO 
as a bailout package. 
22. 
For what has been discussed above we are 
of the considered opinion that the amount received 
/ receivable by electric power supply companies 
from the Government of Pakistan on account of 
difference between lower than the NEPRA Tariff 
rate charged to consumers and the rate notified by 
NEPRA is not subsidy. It is the balance price of 
electricity which is paid by the Government on 
behalf of electricity consumers to provide relief to 
such consumers. The electric power supply 
companies receive their full price of electricity sold 
to consumers partly from consumers and partly 
from the Government.” 
16. 
In conclusion, it is held that the amount recovered 
from consumers as well as subsidy amount constitute 
revenue receipts cumulatively liable to tax and 
comprised in the definition of ‘turnover’ in section 113 
of the Ordinance.  The questions of law are answered in 
favour of the department and against the taxpayers 
(applicants in some reference applications).
