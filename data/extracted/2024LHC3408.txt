Asjad Javaid Ghural-J.       Through this criminal revision petition 
under Sections 435 & 439 Cr.P.C. the petitioner being accused in case FIR 
No.823/23 dated 10.05.2023, in respect of offence under Sections 302, 324, 
353, 427, 431, 186,148,149,505,188 & 109 PPC read with Section 16 of the 
Punjab Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960 and Section 7 of Anti 
Terrorism Act, 1997, registered at police station Cantt. Gujranwala, has 
prayed as under:- 
 
“It is therefore, most respectfully prayed that in the supreme 
interest of justice, by accepting the instant criminal revision petition; this 
Honorable court may be pleased to set-aside the order dated 14.06.2024 
passed by the learned Special Judge, Anti Terrorism Court, Gujranwala 
(Respondent No.1) being void, illegal, unconstitutional, without merits 
and the petitioner may kindly be discharged forthwith from this case in the 
supreme interest of justice.  
 
Any other relief which this Honourable Court deems fit and proper 
may also be granted.” 
2. 
Admitted facts necessary for disposal of instant petition are that the 
petitioner is not named in the aforesaid criminal case and was subsequently 
implicated in the said case on the basis of disclosure of co-accused/approver

Karim Hasan, which was recorded on 30.05.2024 i.e. after more than one 
year of the registration of the case. The petitioner was produced before the 
Judge, Anti Terrorism Court, Gujranwala (ATC), who initially granted her 
four days physical remand vide order dated 10.06.2024. After exhausting the 
said period, the Investigating Officer made a request for further physical 
remand which was acceded to by the ATC and eleven days physical remand 
was granted vide impugned order dated 14.06.2024, which is subject matter 
of this criminal revision.  
3. 
Heard. First of all, we would like to dilate upon the objection of the 
learned Law Officer that since the period of physical remand granted by way 
of impugned order has already been elapsed,  the petitioner was ordered to 
be sent on judicial remand and report U/S 173 Cr.P.C. has been submitted in 
the Trial Court, as such instant petition has become infructuous. We are not 
in agreement with this submission for more than one reasons. Firstly, in the 
prayer clause the petitioner sought her discharge from the said case while 
her learned counsel also addressed arguments on the plea of discharge. 
Secondly, Section 439 Cr.P.C. conferred a very vide jurisdiction upon this 
Court to examine the vires of any order/proceedings for which the record of 
the lower court was requisitioned or which otherwise comes to its 
knowledge. While exercising such jurisdiction, it is the duty of the Court to 
correct manifest illegality or to prevent gross miscarriage of justice. In the 
case reported as “Mushtaq Ahmad .Vs. The State (PLD 1966 Supreme Court 
126)”, the Apex Court observed as under:- 
“Under section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code the High Court has a 
power to interfere upon information in whatever way received, as the 
section clearly says that it may do so in any case in which it has itself 
called for the record or which has been reported for orders or “which 
otherwise comes to its knowledge”. These are words of wide import. In 
the present case the record of the case was placed before the learned Judge 
in the course of his inspection and the facts of the case thus came to his 
knowledge. Under this section the High Court has also the right to 
exercise its power on its own initiative and there can be no warrant for the 
proposition that the High Court is debarred from examining the record suo 
moto.” 
 Similarly, in case reported as “Dr. Waqar Hussain Vs. The State (2000 
SCMR 735)” it has been laid down as under:- 

Crl. Revision No.39439/24  
 
 
 
                                                      3 
 
“So far as the power of the High Court under section 439, Cr.P.C. are 
concerned, it may be stated that it is not a power only but a duty whenever 
facts for its jurisdiction are brought to the notice of the Court, or otherwise 
come to its knowledge because the revisional jurisdiction is in the nature 
of corrective jurisdiction.” 
 Thus we can safely say that the powers conferred upon this Court under 
Section 439 Cr.P.C. are not merely a “toothless paper tiger” rather a duty to 
satisfy itself regarding the correctness, legality or propriety of any order 
passed by the lower court. The facts discussed below would clear the dust 
why this Court constrained to exercise its revisional jurisdiction .  
4. 
Admittedly, trial in the aforesaid criminal case to the extent of some 
of the accused has been concluded, whereas, one of the nominated accused 
namely Karim Hassan, who was declared proclaimed offender, was 
subsequently arrested on 08.05.2024 and thereafter on 30.05.2024, he got 
recorded his statement U/S 337(1) of Cr.P.C. before the Area Magistrate, 
whereby he involved the petitioner alongwith certain other persons to the 
extent of abetment. It was categorically stated at bar by the head of the Joint 
Investigation Team (JIT) as well as Investigating Officer that except the 
aforesaid statement of the accomplice, there was no other incriminating 
material to connect the petitioner with the aforesaid case. It is a matter of 
record that accomplice remained on physical remand for twenty two days 
before recording of such statement, therefore, it cannot be said that he got 
recorded the statement voluntarily and without any coercion. In case 
reported as “Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif Vs. The State (PLD 2009 SC 
814)”, the Apex Court discarded the statement of accomplice while 
observing that:- 
 
“ It is understandable that an accused becomes an approver on motivation 
of self-interest to save his own skin. The circumstances in the present case that led 
P.W. to become an approver indicate that he was not a free agent. He was taken 
into custody by the Army soon after the incident and remained there for about one 
month and was then in police custody for about 10 days, during which he was 
tortured to the extent that he feared that ‘he would die of shock’. Notwithstanding 
such complaint made to the Trial Court, he was again sent to police remand for 
further 3 days which ended a day before he became approver.” 
 
Moreso, in the instant occurrence one person namely Rashid Maqbool 
was allegedly murdered whereas multiple police officials sustained injuries. 
Proviso to Section 337(1) of Cr.P.C. reads as under:- 

Crl. Revision No.39439/24  
 
 
 
                                                      4 
 
 
“[Provided that no person shall be tendered pardon who is involved in an 
offence relating to hurt or qatl without permission of the victim or as the case may 
be of the heirs of the victim]” 
 
It is thus manifestly clear from the above proviso that an accused 
could not tender pardon in hurt or qatl cases without the permission of 
victim or the legal heirs of the deceased, the case may be. In the instant case, 
Rashid Maqbool was the deceased and according to the list furnished by the 
SHO P.S. Cantt. Gujranwala, the  deceased survived by his father, mother 
and sister, whereas, he has divorced his wife 1 ½ years before but no 
document in the shape of divorce deed or divorce effectiveness certificate in 
support of this version was made part of the record. Furthermore, no report 
from the revenue authorities or the concerned Councilor or Lumberdar was 
secured for the confirmation of the legal heirs of the deceased. Moreover, 
bare perusal of the affidavits of the legal heirs it came on surface that the 
same were not attested by the Oath Commissioner to certify that contents of 
said documents were stated on oath or solemn affirmation was made before 
him. In the absence of such certificate, value of so called affidavits of the 
purported legal heirs of the deceased is nothing more than a piece of paper. 
Since the statement of the accomplice was recorded in derogation of the 
proviso to Section 337(1) of Cr.P.C. as such the same was not admissible 
piece of evidence.  
5. 
It is now in the above context, we have to see as to whether the Judge, 
ATC was justified in granting physical remand of the petitioner. The Apex 
Court as well as this Court time and again cautioned the courts below for 
granting physical remand of an accused in a routine or perfunctory manner. 
Unfortunately, it seems that with the passage of time the remand granting 
Courts went into deep slumber and need to be shaken again. The purpose of 
granting physical remand is to dig out the truth and collect further evidence 
which is not possible without the presence of an accused. A duty is bestowed 
upon a Court dealing with such request of remand to maintain balance 
between the personal liberty of the accused and the investigational right of 
the police. Article 9 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 (Constitution) guarantees that no person would be deprived of life or 
liberty save in accordance with law, whereas, Article 10 of the Constitution 
provides safeguards as to the arrest and detention. It is, therefore, in the 

Crl. Revision No.39439/24  
 
 
 
                                                      5 
 
above context that in Part B, Chapter11-B, Volume-3 of Rules and Orders of 
Lahore High Court, Lahore following principles are laid down for the 
guidance of all the concerned for granting physical remand:- 
“(i) Under no circumstances should an accused person be remanded to 
Police custody unless it is made clear that his presence is actually needed 
in order to serve some important and specific purpose connected with the 
completion of the inquiry. A general statement by the officer applying for 
the remand that the accused may be able to give further information 
should not be accepted. 
(ii) When an accused person is remanded to Police custody the period of 
the remand should be as short as possible.  
(iii) In all ordinary cases in which time is required by the Police to 
complete the inquiry, the accused person should be detained in magisterial 
custody. 
(iv) Where the object of the remand is merely the verification of the 
prisoner's statement, he should be remanded to magisterial custody. 
(v) An accused person who has made a confession before a Magistrate 
should be sent to the Judicial lock-up and not made over to the Police after 
the confession has been recorded. If the Police subsequently require the 
accused person for the investigation, a written application should be made 
giving reasons in detail why he is required and an order obtained from the 
Magistrate for his delivery to them for the specific purposes named in the 
application. If an accused person, who has been produced for the purpose 
of making a confession, has declined to make a confession or has made a 
statement which is unsatisfactory from the point of view of the 
prosecution he should not be remanded to Police custody.” 
Here in the instant case, even if the statement of the accomplice is given 
weightage even then at the most it is a case of abetment against the 
petitioner and we are unable to understand, for what purpose in the charge of 
abetment, physical remand of an accused was required. The conclusion is 
inescapable that the only purpose of seeking remand of the petitioner was to 
prolong her custody. Unfortunately, this aspect has been overlooked by the 
learned Judge, ATC while dealing with the request of physical remand of the 
petitioner and granted the physical remand in a mechanical manner, while 
ignoring binding pronouncements of the Apex Court1. 
6. 
Learned Law Officer laid much emphasis that during the period of 
physical remand, the Investigating Officer showed progress and the

petitioner got recovered a USB containing her videos and one mobile phone 
of her husband and from the transcripts of the videos available in the USB, it 
is manifestly vivid that the petitioner instigated the co-accused to commit the 
occurrence. First of all, it is to be noted that the petitioner was behind the 
bars since 10.05.2023 and admittedly her mobile phone was already taken 
into possession in case FIR No.96/23, registered at P.S. Sarwar Road, 
Lahore.  The mobile phone which was allegedly recovered at the instance of 
the petitioner undisputedly belongs to her husband. Investigating Officer, in 
attendance, confirmed that the same was active when taken into possession, 
when confronted how the same can be connected with the petitioner, learned 
DPG submitted that during investigation she admitted that she occasionally 
used the said mobile phone. Merely on that basis that the petitioner 
occasionally used mobile phone of her husband, such mobile or the data 
contained therein cannot be used against her. Even otherwise, from the said 
mobile phone no incriminating material connecting the petitioner with the 
alleged crime was recovered. Second piece of evidence procured by the 
Investigating Officer was the USB. As has been discussed supra the 
petitioner was continuously in custody of police on the basis of different 
criminal cases/ detention orders since 10.05.2023 and the FIR of the 
aforesaid case was also registered on the same date. It is beyond 
comprehension that how the petitioner transferred the data of her social 
media accounts in the USB, when she was already in police custody. Even 
otherwise, transcript of the USB has been placed before us and bare perusal 
of the same shows that it was downloaded from the Youtube and her other 
purported social media accounts, which were active since the day of the 
occurrence, therefore, it can safely be said that the USB was planted upon 
the petitioner just to create evidence against her in this case. No date and 
time of the purported videos of the petitioner was mentioned as such it 
cannot be said with any degree of certainty that the same were prior or after 
the protest. Besides above, JIT Head, in categorical terms admitted that 
mobile phone of any of the co-accused was not taken into possession, so as 
to confirm that on account of the instigation of the petitioner at social media 
forum, he/they committed the said occurrence. In the above backdrop, we 
are of the view that on the basis of evidence created/procured against the 

Crl. Revision No.39439/24  
 
 
 
                                                      7 
 
petitioner, she cannot be connected with the alleged occurrence in any 
eventuality. 
7. 
Malafide of the Investigating Officer is also apparent from the fact 
that in the so-called statement of the accomplice he named a number of 
persons who instigated him and other party members to commit the crime 
but he only caused the arrest of the petitioner and one Alia Hamza and for 
the rest of the accused he did not give any weightage to the statement of the 
accomplice. In this view of the matter, we can safely say that the statement 
of the accomplice was procured with the sole purpose to confine the 
petitioner as she has been released on bail in all other cases registered 
against her.  
8. 
We have noted with great concern that it is a pattern of the 
Executive/Police to involve the petitioner in a series of cases one after the 
other on the basis of same allegation. It is an admitted fact that the petitioner 
was resident of Lahore and whatever she had said on her social media 
account, was being run at Lahore. Part VI, Chapter XV of the Cr.P.C deals 
with the jurisdiction of the criminal Courts in inquiries and trials. Section 
177 of the Cr.P.C. reads as under:  
“177. Ordinary place of inquiry and trial. Every offence shall ordinary be 
inquired in and tried by a Court within the local limits of whose 
jurisdiction it was committed.”  
Bare reading of the aforesaid section makes it abundantly clear that a trial or 
inquiry of an offence shall ordinarily be conducted in a Court within the 
local limits of whose jurisdiction such an offence was committed. In view of 
above any cognizable offence committed in Lahore shall be tried at Lahore 
and accordingly the petitioner had been involved in seven criminal cases 
regarding the same allegations at Lahore. When confronted with, how the 
petitioner could be involved in a case at Gujranwala regarding an act which 
was committed at Lahore, learned Law Officer while referring to Section 
179 Cr.P.C. laid much emphasis that the petitioner can be involved in cases 
when consequence of an occurrence follow in the jurisdiction of some other 
police station. Before proceeding further it is appropriate to go through the 
referred provision which for ease of reference is reproduced as under:- 
“179. Accused triable in, district where act is done or where 
consequence ensues. When a person is accused of the commission of any 
offence by reason of anything which has been done, and of any 
consequence which has ensued, such offence may be inquired into or tried 

Crl. Revision No.39439/24  
 
 
 
                                                      8 
 
by a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction any such thing has 
been done, or any such consequence has ensued.”  
 
 
 
 
Illustrations  
 
“(a) A is wounded within the local limits of the jurisdiction of 
Court X, and dies within the local limits of the jurisdiction of Court Z. The 
offence o f the culpable homicide of A may be inquired into or tried by X 
or Z.”  
 
 
(b ) ----  
 
 
(c ) ---  
“(d) A is wounded in the State of Junagadh, and dies of his wounds in 
Karachi. The offence of causing A's death may be inquired into and tried 
in Karachi.”  
The word “or” used in the aforesaid section and the illustration is of much 
significance which means that either the accused can be tried at a place 
where the act was committed or the place where its consequences ensued. In 
nowhere it can be defined in the manner as argued by the learned Law 
Officer.  This section would come into play where an accused committed an 
act in one jurisdiction and consequence of such offence ensued in another 
jurisdiction but on that basis due to one and the same allegation, an accused 
cannot be involved in multiple cases falling into different jurisdictions. In 
case reported as “Muhammad Sultan versus Muhammad Raza and others 
(2020 SCMR 1200)” the Apex Court has interpreted sections 177 and 179 
of the Cr.P.C in the following manner:  
        “7. A legal question has been raised qua the jurisdiction of the court 
and venue of trial as per law. Chapter XV Part VI of the Criminal 
Procedure Code deals with "Jurisdiction of the Criminal Courts in Inquiry 
and Trials". Section 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure relates to 
general principle of jurisdiction and venue of trial which is reproduced as 
under: -  
“177. Ordinary place of inquiry and trial. Every offence shall 
ordinary be inquired in and tried by a Court within the local limits 
of whose jurisdiction it was committed”.  
 
The language of the said provision is explicit in its context hardly 
leaving any ambiguity qua the interpretation with reference to jurisdiction 
and venue of the trial in ordinary circumstances however this principle has 
certain exceptions which are established from the bare reading of 
provision of sections 179 and 180, Cr.P.C. To evaluate the exceptions of 
the general principle qua jurisdiction and venue of trial, provision of 
section 179, Cr.P.C. is reproduced as under:-  

Crl. Revision No.39439/24  
 
 
 
                                                      9 
 
"179. Accused triable in district where act is done or where 
consequences ensues. When a person is accused of the 
commission of any offence by reason of anything which 
had been done, and of any consequence which has ensued, 
such offence may be inquired into or tried by a Court 
within the limits of whose jurisdiction any such thing has 
been done, or any such consequence has ensued."  
8. Bare perusal of the language of the aforesaid provision depicts that if 
there is any departure from the general principle qua jurisdiction and 
venue of trial, two aspects are to be evaluated for the proper determination 
such as:-  
i. 
Commission of an offence.  
ii. 
Commission of an act and other consequences ensued.  
From the careful perusal of the language of the aforesaid provision, it is 
crystal clear that this provision has extended the limits of venue while 
classifying the principles to assume jurisdiction to take cognizance of an 
offence for the purpose of trial.”  
9. 
We are of the considered view that if the petitioner had committed any 
act at Lahore for which she had already been involved in a criminal case at 
the said place, she cannot be involved regarding the same act/offence in 
some other case on the basis of term “any consequence which has ensued” 
used in Section 179 Cr.P.C. as it would offend Article 13 of the Constitution 
which provides that “no person shall be prosecuted or punished for the same 
offence more than once.” Similarly, the word ‘liberty’ in Article 9 is of 
widest amplitude covering variety of rights including personal liberty of a 
citizen. Likewise, Article 4 of the Constitution enshrines inalienable right of 
every citizen to enjoy the protection of law and be treated in accordance with 
law. Therefore, involving the petitioner in series of criminal cases regarding 
a single act amounts to usurp her fundamental rights guaranteed in the 
Constitution. Moreso, if this practice of involving an accused in multiple 
cases regarding one act is allowed then there can be no end of litigation, 
which is a basis of every judicial system. 
10. 
Act of the Executive/Police to confine the petitioner in the jail for an 
indefinite period is a matter of record. Initially, the petitioner was detained 
on 10.05.2023 under sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Punjab Maintenance 
of Public Order Ordinance, 1960 (MPO) for a period of thirty days. When 
the petitioner questioned the validity of said order issued under MPO by way 
of filing Writ Petition No.31429/23 in this Court, she was booked in case 

Crl. Revision No.39439/24  
 
 
 
                                                      10 
 
FIR No.96/23, registered at P.S. Sarwar Road, Lahore, on 17.05.2023 on the 
basis of suspicion. She was granted post arrest bail in the said case by the 
Trial Court, Lahaore on 23.09.2023 but on 25.09.2023 she was again 
arrested in case FIR No.109/23 of the same police station U/S 54 Cr.P.C., on 
the disclosure of the statement of co-accused. She was granted post arrest 
bail in the said case on 11.10.2023 by the Trial Court, Lahore. Keeping in 
view the tendency of the police for involving the petitioner one after the 
other in blind cases, she finally approached this Court by way of filing Writ 
Petition No.68444/23, inter-alia, seeking details of the cases in which she 
was required to the police. In the said petition, AIG Legal, on behalf of the 
I.G. Punjab, submitted a report that she was required only in two cases, in 
which she was already enlarged on bail/discharged and in the light of said 
report aforesaid writ petition was disposed of vide order dated 19.10.2023.  
However, in sheer disregard to the report submitted before this Court, after 
one day of the disposal of the writ petition, the petitioner was booked in case 
FIR No.1271/23, registered at P.S. Gulberg, Lahore on 20.10.2023 on the 
basis of suspicion but on the following day she was discharged by the ATC 
Judge. Thereafter, on the next day i.e. 21.10.2023, she was involved in case 
FIR No.366/23, registered at P.S. Model Town, Lahore on the basis of 
supplementary statement. She was granted post arrest bail in the said case on 
07.11.2023 by the Trial Court and astonishingly on the following day i.e. 
08.11.2023 she was booked in case FIR No.410/23, P.S. Race Course, 
Lahore on the basis of supplementary statement. She was enlarged on bail in 
the said case on 02.12.2023 by the Trial Court but the Deputy 
Commissioner, Lahore, issued her detention order under the MPO for a 
period of thirty days vide order dated 02.12.2023. Petitioner challenged the 
MPO order by way of filing Writ Petition No.81620/23, upon which MPO 
order was withdrawn vide order dated 29.12.2023 but she could not bear the 
fruits of said withdrawal order, as she was booked in FIR No.367/23, P.S. 
Model Town, Lahore, on 30.12.2023 on the basis of supplementary 
statement. She secured post arrest bail in the said case from the Trial Court 
vide order dated 29.01.2024 and on the same day, she was booked in case 
FIR No.768/23, P.S. Shadman, on the confessional statement of the co-
accused. She was enlarged on bail in the said case on 27.03.2024 by the 
Trial Court. Till that time she had been involved in all cases relating to the 

Crl. Revision No.39439/24  
 
 
 
                                                      11 
 
incidents of 9th May, 2023 registered at Lahore. Thereafter, a very strange 
strategy was adopted by the Executive in order to frustrate the judicial orders 
and she was booked in case FIR No.179/23, registered at P.S. Kamar 
Mashani, District Mianwali on 01.04.2024 on the basis of supplementary 
statement. She was finally discharged in the said case on 17.04.2024 by the 
ATC Judge, Sargodha and on the same day, she was booked in case FIR 
No.180/23, registered at the same police station, wherein, she was granted 
post arrest bail on 29.05.2024 by the Trial Court. She was then booked in 
case FIR No.72/23, P.S. Musa Khel, Mianwali but the learned Judge, ATC, 
Sargodha granted her pre-arrest bail in the said case vide order dated 
05.06.2024. It is noteworthy that when the learned Judge, ATC, Sargodha, 
foiled the efforts of the police to further detain the petitioner in cases 
registered at Mianwali by granting her pre-arrest bail, on the same day, she 
was booked in case FIR No.823/23 registered at P.S Cantt. Gujranwala on 
the basis of confessional statement of co-accused (subject matter of this 
petition). Eager of the Executive to detain her in custody indefinitely is 
evident from the fact that besides involving her in the said case, as a 
precaution, Deputy Commissioner, Gujranwala issued her detention order 
under the MPO, vide order dated 06.06.2024. Apparently, this had been 
done that in case the learned Judge, ATC at Gujranwala discharges the 
petitioner as had been done by the Judge, ATC, Sargodha, then there 
remained a justification to retain her in jail. But thanks to the learned Judge, 
ATC Gujranwala that he neither perused the material connecting the 
petitioner in the said case nor took into the consideration the tendency of the 
prosecution to involve the petitioner one after the other case seriously and 
granted her physical remand blindly. Apparently, on achieving the desired 
result, subsequently the Deputy Commissioner, Gujranwala withdrew his 
detention order.

The purpose of giving the detail of the treatment meted out by the 
petitioner for the last one year is to show highhandedness and disregard to 
the judicial orders by the Executive Authorities just to curtail her liberty. It 
is a matter of great concern that on behalf of Inspector General of Police, 
Punjab a report was submitted before this Court in W.P.No.68444/23 that 
the petitioner was required only in two cases, but after submission of said 
report, she was booked in nine other cases on the same charge/allegation.

Neither the police authorities enjoy unfettered powers to curtail the liberty of 
a person for an indefinite period nor their actions are immune to judicial 
scrutiny. In case reported as “Muhammad Bashir ..Vs.. SHO, Okara Cantt. 
and others (PLD 2007 SC 539)”, the Apex Court has observed as under:- 
“ It may be added that the Police force was not a creation of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure but was a force initially established by the Police Act 
of 1861. The Code of Criminal Procedure only borrowed some, from 
amongst this force, and asked them to perform some of its functions. They 
had, therefore, no powers to go around doing things according to their 
whims and desires in the matter of administration of justice in the field of 
crimes. The powers enjoyed by the members of the police force were 
limited to the authority conferred on them by law. And it may be added 
that every step which the Cr.P.C. permitted a police officer to take, was 
subject to scrutiny and control of some court or Magistrate.” 
12. 
One may disagree with the political views of the petitioner and if she 
committed any crime she has to face the music but the way and manner she 
is being involved in criminal cases one after the other, in least words can be 
said a malicious persecution and this Court being jealous guardian of the 
fundamental rights of the citizens cannot tolerate the same. In  “Ammad 
Yousaf Vs. The State and another (PLD 2024 SC 273)”, the Apex Court 
observed as under:- 
“The exercise of inherent powers assigned to the Courts to preserve and 
protect the rights of the citizens is a mandate of the Constitutions, 
whereas, non-exercise of such powers is a violation of the Constitution 
and law, hence is an illegality. The Courts instead of becoming an 
apparatus for malicious and purposeless judicial prosecution by 
entertaining baseless and frivolous complaints must exercise their powers 
in accordance with law, without fear and favour. If the Courts overlook 
such constitutional mandate and fail to exercise their inherent powers, it 
will harm the integrity, impartiality and independence of our criminal 
justice system. It will undermine and erode the public trust and confidence 
in our Courts.”    
13. 
The principle of trichotomy of power is widely recognized in our 
Constitution. It means the Legislature, the Judiciary and the Executive form 
the fundamental pillars of the State and that each of these are responsible for 
exercising legitimate authority in their respective sphere. Legislature is 
tasked with making new laws and amending existing one to meet the needs 
of the people. The Judiciary is, inter-alia, responsible for interpreting the

                                                      13 
 
law and to protect fundamental rights which include the life and liberty, 
whereas, Executive is responsible for enforcing laws and court orders to 
establish the writ of the State and uphold rule of law. It is the duty of the 
Executive to implement/ comply with the orders whether it likes it or not.  
Neither any country can flourish without giving due regard to the orders of 
the Courts nor the writ of the State can be established. If the orders of the 
Courts are flouted in the way and manner as has been done in the instant 
case then anarchy would prevail. Executive is reminded the well-entrenched 
principle of law that their actions are not immune from the judicial scrutiny, 
therefore, while exercising such authority, they should not intrude into the 
constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights of the citizens. Similarly, the 
Judicial Officers are expected to perform their duty with dignity, pride, 
dedication and by keeping in mind the fact that a sacred obligation to deliver 
justice has been bestowed upon them beyond any temptation, fear or favour. 
They must perform their functions with their eyes and ears open as required 
under the law and their action should not caste even a bleak doubt in the 
minds of the litigants, who are the ultimate stakeholders, that the same was 
result of any enticement or panic. 
14. 
For what has been discussed above, we are of the considered view that 
no incriminating material is available on the record to connect the petitioner 
in FIR No.823/23 dated 10.05.2023, in respect of offence under Sections 
302, 324, 353, 427, 431, 186,148,149,505,188 & 109 PPC read with Section 
16 of the Punjab Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960 and Section 
7 of Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, registered at police station Cantt. Gujranwala 
and the investigation launched in the said case against the petitioner is a 
result of malafide and ulterior motive. As such, while accepting this criminal 
revision, she is discharged from the aforesaid case. Learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General, on instructions, states that the petitioner is not required 
in any other case, as such she shall be released from the jail forthwith.    
15. 
Before parting with this order it is observed that act of the 
Investigating Officer for involving the petitioner in series of cases on the 
same charge after making her arrest in case FIR No.96/23, registered at P.S. 
Sarwar Road, Lahore is colored with malafide intention and ulterior motive 
and the sole purpose of the same was to defeat the judicial system. 
Unfortunately, the Deputy Commissioners, Lahore and Gujranwala also

played active role while issuing detention orders under the MPO, when the 
petitioner was already in jail. Their acts call for strict action but while 
showing grace this Court is not issuing any adverse order against them with 
the expectation that in future they shall not frustrate the judicial orders. At 
the same time, remand granting Courts are cautioned that while dealing with 
request of remand, they should keep in mind the binding pronouncements of 
the Apex Court and fundamental rights of an accused enshrined in the 
Constitution, in particular Articles 4,9,10, 10-A and 13. We will conclude 
with a quote from ‘On Liberty’ a epoch-making book by the famous 
utilitarian English philosopher John Staurt Mill (d.1873):-  
 
“…a State which dwarfs its men, in order they may be more docile 
instruments in its hands even for beneficial purposes – will find that with 
small men no great thing can really be accomplished;...” 
16. 
Copy of this judgment be circulated amongst all the Judicial Officers, 
Deputy Commissioners and Inspector General of Police, Punjab through the 
Registrar of this Court for guidance and strict compliance.
