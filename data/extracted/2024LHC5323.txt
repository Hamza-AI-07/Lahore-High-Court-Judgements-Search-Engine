Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – This petition under Article 199 of 
the 
Constitution 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Pakistan, 
1973  
(the “Constitution”), is directed against the judgment dated 26.8.2023 
delivered by the District and Sessions Judge, Lodhran. 
Background 
2. 
 
The Petitioner owns Tariq Medical Store in Basti Mianpur, 
Tehsil and District Lodhran, and has a valid drug sales licence to run it. 
The Punjab Healthcare Commission (the “Commission”), mandated to 
eradicate quackery1 in the province, launched a series of surveys 
beginning in 2015, including one in District Lodhran, where the Petitioner 
                                          
1 Clause (f) of Regulation 2(1) of the 2016 Regulations defines “quack” as: 
(f) “Quack” means a pretender providing health services without having registration of the 
Pakistan Medical & Dental Council, Council for Tibb, Council for Homeopathy or the 
Pakistan Nursing Council. 
  Clause (g) of Regulation 2(1) of the 2016 Regulations defines “quackery” as follows: 
(g) “Quackery” includes such forms and methods of practices, including but not limited to 
different forms of treatments which are unsubstantiated and lack scientific plausible rationale; 
or are rendered, performed or undertaken, by persons who are not authorized to render, 
perform or undertake the same as per the governing laws, as well as standards of ethics etc., as 
the case may be, whether or not being so rendered, performed or undertaken by a quack as 
defined under the Act or herein.

was identified as engaging in quackery. Subsequently, Dr. Mahmood 
Khan also filed a complaint against the Petitioner. On 25.11.2022, acting 
on Census Data and in response to Dr. Mahmood‟s complaint, two 
officials of the Commission, Muhammad Jawad Khalid and Suleman 
Ahmad (the “PHC Officials”), visited the Petitioner‟s premises but found 
it closed. They marked the location for surveillance and revisited it on 
7.12.2022 and 9.12.2022, but it was closed on both occasions. Upon 
inquiry, the local community informed the PHC Officials that the 
Petitioner was engaged in allopathic practice and had prior notice of their 
visits through WhatsApp groups, which enabled him to evade inspection. 
Consequently, Suleman Ahmad sealed the medical store and reported the 
matter to the Commission on 10.12.2022. 
3. 
 
On 15.2.2023, the PHC Officials visited Tariq Medical Store 
for the fourth time. They found the Commission‟s seals on the premises 
intact, but local residents informed them that the Petitioner had 
established a new clinic, named Tariq Clinic, a few yards behind the 
medical store, where he was allegedly practising allopathic medicine. 
Upon visiting the clinic, the PHC Officials found it operational, but the 
Petitioner 
fled. 
They 
collected 
used 
syringes, 
medical 
waste  
(including injection vials), and loose medicines from the site, recorded 
video footage, and then sealed the premises. The PHC Officials reported 
the matter to the Commission, giving details of the collected materials and 
attaching the footage as evidence. 
4. 
 
On 7.10.2022, the PHC Officials visited the location once 
again. They found the Commission‟s seal on Tariq Medical Store broken, 
though it was closed. Local residents informed them that the Petitioner 
had broken the seal and practised allopathic medicine twice or thrice a 
week. The PHC Officials re-sealed the medical store and submitted a 
report to the Commission. 
5. 
 
Considering the above-mentioned reports, the Commission 
issued a notice dated 16.1.2023 to the Petitioner, directing him to appear 
before its designated committee (the “Hearing Committee”) with all 
relevant documents, qualified staff, and an affidavit explaining his 
position. The Petitioner did not respond, so the Commission again issued 
him a summons on 20.2.2023 and 2.5.2023. He failed to respond to any of 

Writ Petition No. 7031/2023 
 
 
 
- 3 - 
them. Eventually, the Commission sought assistance from the District 
Police Officer, who ensured his appearance before the Hearing Committee 
on 8.5.2023. 
6. 
 
The Petitioner‟s plea before the Hearing Committee was that 
he owned Tariq Medical Store, which he operated under a valid drug sales 
licence, and the store premises were his personal property. He explained 
that when his medical store was sealed, he was busy with his cousin, who 
had cancer and later passed away. He denied engaging in quackery at the 
store and claimed he had no connection with Tariq Clinic, which the PHC 
Officials sealed on 15.2.2023. He said a different person had been 
practising at that clinic but left after two months. The Petitioner also 
submitted an affidavit regarding his defence. 
7. 
 
The Hearing Committee confronted the Petitioner with the 
PHC Officials‟ visit reports and the supporting evidence. He refuted them 
and reiterated his aforementioned version. 
8. 
 
Upon conclusion of the proceedings, the Hearing Committee, 
by order dated 8.5.2023, imposed a fine of Rs. 300,000/- on the Petitioner 
and directed that Tariq Medical Store and Tariq Clinic be kept under 
surveillance to ensure that no healthcare services are provided in violation 
of the Punjab Healthcare Commission Act, 2010 (the “PHC Act”)2 and the 
Anti-Quackery Regulations3 (the “2016 Regulations”). The Petitioner 
filed an appeal under section 31 of the PHC Act against the said order. 
The District and Sessions Judge, Lodhran, partially accepted it vide 
judgment dated 26.8.2023 and reduced the amount of the fine from 
Rs.300,000/- to Rs.150,000/- 
9. 
 
It is pertinent to mention that nobody has come forward to 
challenge the sealing of Tariq Clinic, which remains sealed. The 
Petitioner has disclaimed the ownership of Tariq Clinic throughout the 
proceedings and has asserted that he has no connection with it. 
                                          
2 Clause (xvi) of the PHC Act defines “healthcare services” as follows: 
“Healthcare services” means services provided for diagnosis, treatment or care of persons 
suffering from any physical or mental disease, injury or disability including procedures that are 
similar to forms of medical, dental or surgical care but are not provided in connection with a 
medical condition and includes any other service notified by the Government.  
3 I have used the term “Anti-Quackery Regulations” for brevity. The full title is:  
“The Punjab Healthcare Commission Regulations for banning quackery in all its forms and 
manifestations and for dealing with quacks, 2016.” 

Writ Petition No. 7031/2023

The submissions of the parties 
10. 
 
Ch. Shafi Muhammad Tariq, Advocate, contends that the 
proceedings against the Petitioner are illegal and should be quashed. He 
argues that, under section 22(2) of the PHC Act, an inspection team is 
authorized to inspect a healthcare establishment4 only (a) at the time of 
issuance or renewal of a licence or (b) upon receiving a formal complaint. 
Therefore, the PHC Officials had no lawful authority to visit the 
Petitioner‟s medical store. Their reports have no legal value, and no action 
could be taken against him on their basis. Mr. Shafi next contends that 
section 2(xviii) of the PHC Act outlines the qualifications and 
composition of an “inspection team.” The officials who conducted the 
proceedings in this case did not meet these statutory requirements. 
Resultantly, the said proceedings were without jurisdiction and  
coram non judice. The counsel further contends that the PHC Act does 
not empower the Commission to seal or close healthcare establishments. 
Hence, Regulations 5 and 5A of the 2016 Regulations are ultra vires of 
the Act. Lastly, he asserts that under section 28, read with section 4(2)(g) 
of the PHC Act, only the Commission is competent to impose a fine on 
individuals found to be practising quackery. It cannot delegate this power 
to a committee. Therefore, the order dated 8.5.2023 is void, and because 
the District and Sessions Judge has failed to appreciate this point, his 
judgment dated 26.8.2023 is also unsustainable. Mr. Shafi relies on 
Punjab Healthcare Commission v. Mushtaq Ahmad Ch. and others 
(PLD 2016 Lahore 237)5 and Manzoor Elahi v. District & Sessions 
Judge, Sargodha, and others (PLD 2021 Lahore 843) in support of his 
contentions. 
11. 
 
On the factual aspect, Mr. Shafi argues that there is no 
evidence to suggest that the Petitioner was involved in quackery at his 
medical store. As regards the second premises, Tariq Clinic, the Petitioner 
                                          
4 Section 2(xv) of the PHC Act defines “healthcare establishment” as under: 
(xv) 
“healthcare establishment” means a hospital, diagnostic centre, medical clinics, 
nursing home, maternity home, dental clinic, homeopathy clinic, Tibb clinic, 
acupuncture, physiotherapy clinic or any other premises or conveyance: 
(a) 
wholly or partly used for providing healthcare services; and 
(b) 
declared by the Government, by order published in the official Gazette, as a 
healthcare establishment.

neither owns nor has any connection with it. Therefore, the Hearing 
Committee‟s order dated 8.5.2023 lacks a legal foundation and is liable to 
be set aside. 
12. 
 
The Commission‟s Legal Advisor, Mr. Gulzar Ahmad Khan 
Durrani, has controverted the above contentions. He maintains that the 
PHC Officials and the Hearing Committee conducted the proceedings in 
accordance with the law. He emphasizes that, under section 4(g) of the 
PHC Act, the Commission is competent to delegate its powers to 
committees, including the authority to impose fines. Therefore, the 
Presiding Officer‟s appointment was valid, and her order dated 8.5.2023 
is to be reckoned as the Commission‟s order and enforced accordingly. 
Regarding the Manzoor Elahi’s case, Mr. Durrani argues that Mr. Shafi‟s 
reliance on it is misplaced because the Supreme Court of Pakistan set 
aside that judgment through its order dated 18.11.2021 in Civil Petition 
No. 5444 of 2022 (titled: “Chairperson Punjab Healthcare Commission 
v. District & Sessions Judge, Sargodha, and another”). He has also 
submitted a copy of that order, which has been placed on record. 
13. 
 
Mr. Durrani refutes the Petitioner‟s contention that there is 
no incriminating material against him. He contends that the PHC 
Officials‟ reports, recovery of used syringes and vials, and video footage 
established that he was engaged in quackery prohibited by law. 
Questions of law 
14. 
 
This petition raises the following questions of law: 
i) 
Does Regulation 3(2) of the 2016 Regulations conflict 
with section 22 of the PHC Act? 
ii) 
Are the powers of seizure and sealing conferred by 
Regulations 5 and 5A of the 2016 Regulations ultra 
vires of the PHC Act? 
iii) 
Can the Punjab Healthcare Commission delegate its 
adjudicative powers to a committee in cases involving 
violations of the PHC Act, rules, or the 2016 
Regulations? If so, is that committee competent to 
impose fines on the offender? 
15. 
 
Since the above questions are of public importance and 
involve interpretation of the Constitution and statutory law, this Court 
issued a notice to the Advocate General Punjab under Order XXVII-A of 
the Code of Civil Procedure 1908. 

Writ Petition No. 7031/2023

The Advocate General’s submissions 
16. 
 
The Advocate General has filed written submissions in 
response to the notice under Order XXVII-A CPC. He argues that section 
4 of the PHC Act grants the Commission broad authority, including the 
power to delegate its functions. He submits that section 22 pertains to the 
inspection process, while Regulation 3(2) provides a mechanism to 
combat quackery. There is no conflict between these provisions as they 
govern different aspects of the Commission‟s regulatory functions. The 
Advocate General contends that the Petitioner‟s challenge to the 
Commission‟s authority to seal healthcare establishments is unfounded 
because it is based on the Lahore High Court‟s judgment reported in  
PLD 2016 Lahore 237, which the Supreme Court has overturned. In a 
subsequent ruling (PLD 2018 Lahore 762), the High Court upheld the 
Commission‟s power to seal premises under the precautionary principle, 
affirming that section 4 of the PHC Act includes the authority to take 
preventive measures, such as sealing healthcare establishments, to protect 
public health. 
17. 
 
The Advocate General maintains that the Commission can 
lawfully delegate its quasi-judicial functions, including imposing fines, 
under sections 4(2)(m) and 4(3) of the PHC Act. The PHC Act does not 
differentiate between powers that can be delegated and those that cannot, 
allowing for the delegation of all powers and functions, including the 
imposition of penalties. The Advocate General asserts that the Petitioner‟s 
reliance on Manzoor Elahi v. District & Sessions Judge, Sargodha, and 
others  (PLD 2021 Lahore 843) is misplaced because the Supreme Court 
has set it aside and it is no longer a good law. Even otherwise, that 
judgment failed to address the PHC Act‟s explicit provisions that permit 
delegation.  
Opinion 
18. 
 
The PHC Act of 2010 aims to improve the quality of 
healthcare services and ban quackery in the Punjab in all its forms and 
manifestations.6 It applies to all healthcare establishments, public and 
private hospitals, non-profit organizations, charitable hospitals, trust

hospitals, semi-government and autonomous healthcare organizations.7 
The PHC Act establishes the Punjab Healthcare Commission to achieve 
the said purpose, and section 4 outlines its functions and powers. Section 
4(3) of the PHC Act allows the Commission to delegate any of its 
functions to another person, subject to terms and conditions mutually 
agreed upon between the Commission and that person. 
19. 
 
Under section 5(1) of the PHC Act, the Board is entrusted 
with the overall supervision, direction, and management of the 
Commission‟s affairs, including its policy-making responsibilities. It is 
empowered to exercise all the powers and perform any acts, deeds, or 
functions that the Commission is authorized to undertake under the Act. 
Section 9(3) authorizes the Board to establish committees to assist it in 
performing its functions. 
20. 
 
Chapter V (sections 22 to 31) of the PHC Act deals with 
inspection and enforcement. Section 40 empowers the Commission to 
make regulations for carrying out the purposes of the Act by issuing a 
notification in the official Gazette. Under section 41, the Government may 
also frame rules to give effect to the provisions of the Act. 
21. 
 
The 
Commission 
initially 
issued 
Standing 
Orders,8  
(the “Standing Orders”) purportedly under sections 4(2)(q) and 9(1)(i) of 
the PHC Act, to address quackery. These inter alia provided for setting up 
an Anti-Quackery Cell and authorized the Commission to seal or close 
down healthcare establishments. However, in Punjab Healthcare 
Commission v. Mushtaq Ahmad Ch. and others (PLD 2016 Lahore 
237),9 the Court held that while section 4(2)(q) of the PHC Act mandates 
the Commission to take necessary steps to ban quackery, it does not 
authorize the creation of a new regime, such as setting up an Anti-
Quackery Cell through a Standing Order. The “necessary steps” must be 
taken through subordinate or delegated legislation. The Court stated that 
section 13, read with section 31(1)(c) of the Act, does not empower the 
Commission to seal or close healthcare establishments. A passing 
reference in section 31 to an order closing a healthcare establishment is of

no consequence, as the Act does not confer substantive power to issue 
such an order. Administrative Standing Orders cannot substitute proper 
statutory provisions or rules. Consequently, the sealing of the healthcare 
establishment was deemed unlawful, and the decision of the District and 
Sessions Judge, Toba Tek Singh, which set aside the sealing, was upheld. 
The Court recommended that the Commission propose amendments to the 
PHC Act or develop the necessary rules and regulations to achieve what 
was intended in the Standing Orders. Until such steps are taken, neither 
the Commission nor the Board can seal healthcare establishments or 
establish an Anti-Quackery Cell to handle third-party complaints. 
22. 
 
In response to the Court‟s observations in the aforementioned 
case, the Commission, exercising its powers under section 40(1), read in 
conjunction with section 4(1) and clauses (j) and (k) of section 40(2) of 
the PHC Act, framed the Anti-Quackery Regulations 201610 vide 
Notification No.REG.AQ-1/2016 dated 10.9.2016 (published in the 
Punjab Gazette on 27.10.2016). These Regulations were subsequently 
amended in 2017.11  
23. 
 
Additionally, the Commission appealed the aforementioned 
judgment in the Supreme Court. On 14.2.2017, through a consent order, 
the Supreme Court accepted that appeal (along with other connected 
appeals)12 and remanded the cases to this Court to be consolidated and 
heard alongside Writ Petition No. 2427/2017. In that petition, the 
constitutionality of the PHC Act was challenged on the grounds that the 
Provincial Government lacks the authority to legislate on matters related 
to the medical profession, as Entry 11, Part II of the Federal Legislative 
List reserves the regulation of legal, medical, and other professions for the 
Federal Government. The argument was that the PHC Act attempts to 
regulate the medical profession by requiring all medical practitioners to 
register with the Commission, which conflicts with federal law since such 
practitioners are already registered under federal law.

24. 
 
In the post-remand judgment dated 6.7.2018, which is 
reported as Punjab Healthcare Commission v. Mushtaq Ahmed 
Chaudhary and others (PLD 2018 Lahore 762), the Court ruled that the 
PHC Act does not regulate the medical profession but instead regulates 
healthcare services, establishments, and service providers. These areas do 
not fall under the subject of the medical profession but rather within the 
realm of public health or healthcare, which requires regulation, 
standardization, and accountability. In any regulatory framework, 
registration and licensing are essential for the authority to achieve its 
objectives and mandate. Accordingly, the Commission is responsible for 
establishing a clinical governance and healthcare system to effectively 
monitor all services, providers, and establishments within the healthcare 
sector. This is distinctly different from the registration of medical 
practitioners. The Court concluded that the PHC Act is not ultra vires the 
Constitution, and its mandate falls squarely under provincial jurisdiction. 
25. 
 
The Court further held that the power to seize and seal is a 
necessary preventive measure to protect public health and safety. Based 
on the precautionary principle, this power shifts the focus from reaction to 
prevention. Under section 4 of the PHC Act, the Commission possesses 
inherent powers to seal healthcare establishments as a precautionary step, 
a power that existed even before the framing of the 2016 Regulations. The 
relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
“The Regulations issued under Section 40(1) of the [PHC] Act in 2016 
prescribe the procedure to be adopted when the Commission is to seal a 
healthcare establishment. Hence, the power of sealing exercised by the 
Commission is in furtherance of the mandate of the [PHC] Act and the 
powers given to it under the law. In this regard, the power exercised 
prior to the framing of the Regulations falls within the inherent power 
to seal healthcare establishments to prevent any further risk or harm to 
persons under treatment or care by a healthcare establishment or 
healthcare service provider. Hence, no illegality is made out against the 
act of sealing.” 
26. 
 
Leave to appeal was preferred against the above judgment 
dated 6.7.2018, but the Supreme Court refused the same vide order dated 
26.12.2018. 
27. 
 
It is pertinent to note that earlier, while adjudicating upon 
SMC No.1 of 2010 and HRC No.27813-P of 2017, the Supreme Court 
issued the following order on 14.4.2018: 

Writ Petition No. 7031/2023 
 
 
 
- 10 -
“We accordingly direct the C.E.O. of the Punjab Healthcare 
Commission to take immediate steps to ban such business including 
sealing of premises where quackery is being practiced throughout the 
Province of Punjab. In case in pursuance of this order, the premises 
where quackery is being practiced are sealed by the Commission, no 
other Court in Pakistan shall interfere in the order passed by the 
Commission. The aggrieved person may approach this Court for 
redressal of his grievance as the order for banning and sealing of 
premises has been passed by this Court …” 
28. 
 
Having outlined the legislative framework, let‟s delve into 
the moot points. 
Vires of Regulation 3(2) 
29. 
 
Chapter V of the PHC Act deals with inspection and 
enforcement. Section 22, in relevant part, provides: 
22. Inspection.– (1) The Commission may, by order in writing, appoint 
an inspection team to perform the functions and exercise the powers of 
the Commission in relation to inspections under this Act, rules, or 
regulations subject to such conditions and limitations as the 
Commission may specify in this behalf. 
(2) 
The inspection team may inspect a healthcare establishment: 
(a) 
at the time of issuance and renewal of licence; or 
(b) 
on receipt of a complaint. 
(3) 
The inspection team may inspect any apparatus, appliance, 
equipment, instrument, product, goods, or item used or found in, or any 
practice or procedure being carried out at the healthcare establishment. 
(4) 
The inspection team may enquire any case if there has been any 
instance or allegation of maladministration, malpractice, or failure in 
the provision of healthcare services against a healthcare establishment. 
(5) 
The Commission may impose a fine which may extend to fifty 
thousand rupees upon a healthcare service provider who –  
(a) 
refuses or fails, without reasonable cause, to furnish any 
information to the inspection team; or 
(b) 
gives any false or misleading information to the 
inspection team. 
(6) 
…  
(7) 
… 
30. 
 
Section 22(1) of the PHC Act grants the Commission the 
general power to appoint an inspection team13 to carry out its functions 
and exercise its powers regarding inspections under the Act, rules, or 
regulations to ensure compliance with the law. In contrast, section 22(2) 
applies specifically to two scenarios: when a healthcare establishment 
                                          
13 Section 2(xviii) of the PHC Act defines “inspection team”, and specifies its composition and 
qualification of those who can be appointed to it. Section 2(xviii) states: 
(xviii) 
“Inspection team” means a team comprising more than two medical experts having 
postgraduate qualification and not less than fifteen years‟ experience in the concerned field, 
and consisting of one employee of the Commission and others from public or private sector, to 
inspect any healthcare establishment under the Act. 

Writ Petition No. 7031/2023 
 
 
 
- 11 -
applies for a new licence or renewal and when there is a complaint against 
a healthcare establishment. The overall focus of section 22, particularly 
through section 22(2), seems to be ensuring that licensed establishments 
meet the required standards. However, the broader authority granted by 
section 22(1) can extend to other areas like quackery if needed. 
31. 
 
While section 22 of the PHC Act lays down the inspection 
procedure, section 4(1) generally empowers the Commission to “perform 
such functions and exercise such powers as may be required to improve 
the quality of healthcare services and clinical governance and to ban 
quackery.” Section 4(2) lists the specific powers without prejudice to the 
generality of section 4(1). Section 4(2)(m) empowers the Commission to 
appoint, engage, authorize, and terminate employees, consultants, 
advisors, attorneys, inspection teams, contractors, agents, and experts on 
such terms and conditions as deemed fit and assign, delegate, or entrust 
them with such functions and powers as are expedient for the performance 
of functions of the Commission. Section 4(2)(q) allows the Commission 
to take necessary steps to ban quackery. Furthermore, section 4(3) 
authorizes the Commission to assign any of its functions to an individual. 
Section 4(4)(b) empowers it to coordinate with the Government.  
32. 
 
Section 22 of the PHC Act cannot be construed in a manner 
that undermines or nullifies section 4. To reconcile the two sections, the 
court may invoke the rule of purposive interpretation, which focuses on 
the law‟s underlying purpose to ensure it achieves the intended objective 
when the literal meaning leads to an ambiguous, absurd, or unjust 
outcome. In Mangin v. Inland Revenue Commission, [1971] 1 All ER 
179 at 182, [1971] AC 739 at 746, the Privy Council stated: “the object of 
the construction of a statute being to ascertain the will of the legislature it 
may be presumed that neither injustice nor absurdity was intended. If, 
therefore, a literal interpretation would produce such a result, and the 
language admits of an interpretation which would avoid it, then such an 
interpretation may be adopted.” In Molar Mal (Dead) through L.Rs v. 
M/s Kay Iron Works (P) Ltd. (AIR 2000 SC 1261), the Supreme Court of 
India held: 
“… normally the courts will have to follow the rule of literal 
construction which rule enjoins the court to take the words as used by 
the Legislature and to give it the meaning which naturally implies. But, 

Writ Petition No. 7031/2023 
 
 
 
- 12 -
there is an exception to this rule. That exception comes into play when 
application of literal construction of the words in the Statute leads to 
absurdity, inconsistency or when it is shown that the legal context in 
which the words are used or by reading the Statute as a whole, it 
requires a different meaning.” 
33. 
 
The purpose of section 22 of the PHC Act is that a healthcare 
establishment should be inspected by qualified persons so that they may 
ensure regulatory compliance. These inspections naturally require 
technical expertise, as inspectors must evaluate complex medical practices 
and equipment, ensuring that the healthcare establishment is providing 
safe and effective services. In contrast, identifying quackery primarily 
involves verifying the credentials of the individual concerned, which does 
not demand the same level of technical expertise. Therefore, a technical 
expert is not essential for inspecting premises suspected of quackery. 
34. 
 
Regulation 3(2) of the 2016 Regulations empowers the 
Commission to authorize executive authorities or law enforcement 
agencies, through written instructions or directions, to exercise the 
necessary powers to visit premises suspected of quackery. These agencies 
are required to report quacks and quackery-related activities to the 
Commission, either directly or through designated officers. Regulation 
3(2) is fundamentally based on the wide powers granted to the 
Commission under section 4 of the PHC Act. While the Commission can 
appoint inspection teams under section 22 for various purposes, including 
investigating quackery, Regulation 3(2) derives its legitimacy from the 
Commission‟s broader regulatory authority under section 4. Therefore, it 
is lawful and not ultra vires. Question-I is answered in the negative.  
Vires of Regulations 5 & 5A 
35. 
 
As discussed, the Commission initially issued Standing 
Orders, purportedly under sections 4(2)(q) and 9(1)(i) of the PHC Act, to 
combat quackery and, to this end, inter alia, provided for the 
establishment of an Anti-Quackery Cell and sealing/closing the premises 
where quacks operated. However, in Punjab Healthcare Commission v. 
Mushtaq Ahmed Ch. and others (PLD 2016 Lahore 237), when the Court 
declared these Standing Orders to be without lawful authority, the 
Commission framed the 2016 Regulations under section 40 of the PHC 
Act. These Regulations were subsequently amended in 2017.

36. 
 
Regulation 2(1) of the 2016 Regulations mandates the 
Commission to establish an Anti-Quackery Cell to receive and manage 
reports and complaints regarding quackery and ensure that healthcare 
services are rendered in accordance with the provisions of the PHC Act, 
regulations, Minimum Service Delivery Standards, Reference Manuals, 
and the Commission‟s orders issued from time to time. Regulation 5 
empowers authorized officers, including those from executive authorities, 
law enforcement, or any other person designated by the Commission, to 
inspect the relevant premises to verify whether healthcare service 
providers have valid registrations from recognized councils14 and fulfill 
licensing requirements. If the officers find any violations, they should 
seize relevant evidence, such as prescription slips or medicines, and 
collect statements from patients or attendants willing to testify. They 
should also prepare an on-site recovery memorandum with signatures and 
thumb impressions from those present, documenting the findings. 
Regulation 5A authorizes the said officers to seal premises if unregistered 
individuals are found providing healthcare services or if quackery is being 
practised. Before sealing, officers must confirm that no patients requiring 
urgent care are on the premises and, if needed, arrange for their safe 
transfer. Officers are also responsible for safeguarding medicines or 
perishable items to prevent spoilage. Once the premises are sealed, the 
keys are handed to the healthcare establishment‟s owner or manager, or if 
they are unavailable, submitted to the Commission along with a report. 
37. 
 
The legislative intent of the PHC Act is to empower the 
Commission to safeguard public health by regulating healthcare standards 
and eliminating quackery. The powers of seizure and sealing are robust 
enforcement mechanisms that align with this intent and enable the 
Commission to act swiftly and effectively against quackery. They  
are consistent with the broad mandate given to the Commission under 
section 4 of the PHC Act, which allows the Commission to take all 
necessary steps to ban quackery and protect public health. Consequently, 
Regulations 5 and 5A of the 2016 Regulations are intra vires the PHC 
Act. Question-II is also answered in the negative.

Council for Tibb, or the National Council for Homeopathy.

Jurisdiction of the Hearing Committees 
38. 
 
Originally, any authority other than the courts was described 
as “administrative.” In early cases, when such authorities were required to 
make determinations affecting the rights of parties, they were expected to 
“act judicially.” However, it was soon realized that even when 
administrative authorities made decisions based on judicial principles, 
their role could not be classified as “judicial”, as this function was 
reserved exclusively for courts of law. The term “quasi-judicial”, 
meaning “not exactly”, was coined to address this distinction. Today, it is 
common to describe an authority as quasi-judicial when it possesses some 
attributes or trappings of a “court”, but not all.15  
39. 
 
According to Wade & Forsyth,16 “administrative law needs 
consistent working definitions of the three primary constitutional 
functions, legislative, administrative and judicial; and also of the hybrid 
„quasi-judicial‟ function which has a part of its own to play.” Judicial 
decisions are based on legal rules and principles, with a judge seeking the 
correct solution through objective analysis. In contrast, an administrative 
decision is guided by policy, focusing on what is suitable and desirable in 
the public interest. Despite some overlap, the roles of judges and 
administrators differ fundamentally, with judges being objective and 
administrators focusing on practical, policy-driven solutions. The concept 
of quasi-judicial functions refers to administrative tasks that must follow 
certain judicial procedures, such as adhering to natural justice principles. 
For example, when a minister decides on a planning appeal, the decision 
is based on policy, but the process requires fairness and transparency, 
similar to judicial procedures. 
40. 
 
De Smith’s Judicial Review explains that the term quasi-
judicial function may have any one of the following three meanings: First, 
it may describe a function that is partly judicial and partly administrative, 
such as the process of issuing a compulsory purchase order, where an 
administrative decision is made after a judicial-like inquiry and 
consideration of objections. Second, it may refer to the judicial aspect 
within a broader administrative process, such as the inquiry and objection

handling, which are considered quasi-judicial acts. Finally, the term may 
apply to discretionary acts where the decision-maker‟s discretion is not 
entirely free but is bound by certain legal standards or principles of 
fairness.  
41. 
 
It is a well-known principle of law that when a person is 
granted authority, particularly where their individual judgment and 
discretion are trusted, they must personally exercise that power unless 
explicitly allowed to delegate it.17 This tenet is sometimes expressed in 
the form of the maxim delegatus non potest delegare (or delegate potestas 
non potest delgari). It has been applied most rigorously to proceedings of 
courts, requiring the judge to act personally throughout a case except 
insofar as he is expressly absolved from this duty by statute. Special 
tribunals and public bodies exercising functions broadly analogous to the 
judicial are also barred from delegating their decision-making authority 
unless the law allows it.18 Nevertheless, courts may recognize an implied 
authority for public bodies to delegate certain tasks, such as investigating, 
gathering evidence, and making recommendations, if two conditions are 
satisfied: (a) the original body retains the power of decision in its own 
hands and receives a report full enough to enable it to comply with its 
duty to “hear” before deciding, and (b) the context does not indicate that it 
must perform the entire “adjudicatory” process itself.19  
42. 
 
According to De Smith’s Judicial Review, the following are 
some of the general principles of delegation of discretion:20 
(i) 
The delegation may be deemed invalid if an authority grants 
discretionary powers to committees, sub-committees, or 
individuals without retaining supervisory control. 
(ii) 
The extent of control the delegating authority maintains over the 
actions of the delegate, such as the power to reject a decision or 
recommendation, is crucial for ensuring the delegation is valid. 
(iii) 
The ability to delegate discretionary powers depends on the 
scope of the authority, its impact on individual interests, and the 
need for efficient public administration. The choice of delegate 
should be based on practicality, not rank, and should consider 
factors like resources, skills, and experience.

(iv) 
It is improper to delegate broad discretionary powers to another 
authority unless expressly authorized, especially if the 
delegating body cannot control the other authority. 
(v) 
Discretionary 
powers 
assigned 
to 
a 
specific 
officer  
(e.g., a chief of police) cannot be exercised by someone else 
unless there is a statutory provision for a deputy or if 
administrative necessity outweighs personal responsibility. 
(vi) 
Sub-delegation of powers that have already been delegated is 
more strictly controlled than the initial delegation, as Parliament 
is presumed to allow no further delegation unless explicitly 
stated. 
(vii) 
Powers to sub-delegate do not usually include the authority to 
delegate tasks requiring judgment unless such delegation is 
necessary for performing the duty. 
(viii) Statutes that allow sub-delegation must be followed strictly, 
ensuring that delegation is conveyed properly and the scope of 
delegated functions is clearly defined. 
43. 
 
It may be advantageous to refer to some cases decided by our 
courts that elaborate the principles of delegation. In Pakistan Electronic 
Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) v. Pakistan Broadcasters 
Association and another (2023 SCMR 1043), the Supreme Court held 
that when considering delegation, the authority must begin by identifying 
the individual to whom the delegation is made and the specific power, 
responsibility, or function to be delegated. It should take into account 
factors such as the significance of the task, the nature of the responsibility 
or function, the context in which it is exercised, and its impact on those 
affected. While these factors are not exhaustive, they are essential for 
making a lawful delegation. The authority must act as a sieve and “scale” 
its powers, responsibilities, and functions in order of importance. 
Delegation cannot be appropriately made without this assessment, or at 
the very least, an awareness of these considerations when deciding 
whether to delegate. This principle is fundamental, and any delegation 
made without such consideration would be unlawful. Consequently, the 
more significant the power, responsibility, or function, the higher in the 
hierarchy the delegate must be, and the delegation process – whether by 
general or special order – must reflect this. Although the statutory 
language may sometimes suggest broad discretion in imposing conditions 
on delegation, the Supreme Court clarified that this discretion is not 
unfettered. It must be exercised in a structured, contextual, and coherent 
manner rather than being applied arbitrarily.

44. 
 
In Fun Infotainment (Pvt) Ltd. v. Pakistan Electronic 
Media Regulatory Authority and others (PLD 2024 SC 230), the 
Supreme Court held that when a statutory authority, such as PEMRA, is 
empowered to delegate its powers, responsibilities, or functions, that 
discretion must be exercised reasonably and non-arbitrarily, and should 
align with the statutory purpose. Delegation is an executive function, and 
its validity is judged by the same standards as any other administrative 
discretion. When delegating a power, responsibility, or function, the 
authority must not distort the statutory scheme, and any conditions 
imposed should be rational and appropriate. As emphasized by Pakistan 
Broadcasters Association,21 the more important the power, responsibility, 
or function being considered for delegation, the higher the “threshold” 
must be for the authority in deciding not to impose any conditions. This 
threshold should be gauged according to the importance of the power, 
responsibility, or function being delegated, and as the authority delegates 
more significant powers, responsibilities, or functions, the threshold – and 
the discretion not to impose conditions – diminishes. The selection of the 
delegate must be reasonable, and any improper delegation is subject to 
judicial review. 
45. 
 
The concept of delegation must be clearly distinguished from 
agency. There are three main characteristics of agency. First, an agent acts 
on behalf of the principal, in the principal‟s name, and any actions taken 
by the agent within their authority are attributable to the principal. These 
principles also apply to delegation in administrative law, where it is 
generally unlawful for a delegate to exercise powers in their own name. 
However, when Parliament delegates legislative powers or is validly sub-
delegated by its delegate, the delegate or sub-delegate exercises the 
powers in their own name. In local government, administrative delegation 
schemes often operate in ways that diverge from the traditional principal-
agent relationship. Secondly, an agent typically receives detailed 
instructions from the principal and operates with limited discretion. In 
contrast, those entrusted with statutory discretionary powers often 
exercise sufficient autonomy. The level of control retained by the 
delegating authority is usually a critical factor in determining the validity 
                                          
21 Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) v. Pakistan Broadcasters Association and 
another (2023 SCMR 1043).

of the delegation. Courts are more likely to uphold delegation when the 
authority retains significant control and may even conclude that no 
delegation has occurred if the original authority continues to exercise 
substantial oversight over the powers. Thirdly, in agency, the principal 
retains concurrent powers with the agent, meaning the principal can act 
alongside or instead of the agent, even when the agent is authorized to act. 
The agent operates on behalf of the principal, but the principal does not 
relinquish their authority. On the other hand, delegation involves the 
transfer of specific powers or functions to a delegate. Once delegated, the 
delegate exercises those powers independently within the scope of the 
delegation, and the authority cannot directly exercise the delegated 
powers unless the terms of the delegation explicitly provide for such a 
right. However, it retains oversight and may revoke or amend the 
delegation. The delegator is bound by decisions made by the delegate 
within the scope of the delegated authority.22 
46. 
 
In view of the above distinction between delegation and 
agency, in Abdul Haseeb Khan v. Ravi Urban Development Authority 
and others [2023 PLC (C.S.) 804], this Court explained that in cases of 
statutory delegation, the delegate exercises the assigned powers and 
performs the delegated functions in their own name. This is because 
statutory delegation grants authorization to act personally rather than as an 
agent. The relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
“In the case of statutory delegation, the delegate exercises the powers 
and performs the functions delegated to him by acting in his own name 
as the delegation involves an authorization to act personally rather than 
as an agent. The nature of such a delegation was described in  
B (A Solicitor) v. Victorian Lawyers RPA Ltd. (2002) 6 VR 642 as 
under: 
„A delegate acting is not an agent who exercises the 
[delegator‟s] powers but rather, as the new repository of the 
powers, exercises his own powers as a delegate.‟ 
“In case where the Authority has not delegated its power but has only 
authorized a person or an employee to act in exercise of its power, the 
act is to be done in the name of the Authority (see London County 
Council v. Agricultural Food Products Ltd. [1955] 2 Q.B. 218 per 
Romer L.J. at p.224.). On the other hand, where a delegate is exercising 
the power delegated to him under a statute, he may validly exercise that 
power in his own name (see Owendale (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Anthony (1967) 
117 CLR 539). Similarly, it is well established that when a power is so 
delegated, the delegate must exercise his own independent discretion in

the exercise of the delegated power (see Northern Land Council v. 
Quall [2020] HCA 33). However, this principle is not absolute as it 
yields to any contrary indicator found in the language, scope or object 
of the statute.” 
47. 
 
Having reviewed the law, I now turn to the question whether 
the Commission can delegate its adjudicative powers to a committee in 
cases involving violations of the PHC Act, rules, or regulations and 
whether that committee is competent to impose fines on offenders.23 
48. 
 
As noted above, section 4 of the PHC Act outlines the 
Commission‟s functions and powers. Clause (g) of section 4(2) empowers 
the Commission to impose and collect penalties for violations of the rules, 
regulations, standing orders, and instructions issued under the Act. Clause 
(m) of section 4(2) empowers the Commission to appoint employees, 
consultants, advisors, attorneys, inspection teams, contractors, agents, and 
experts and assign, delegate, or entrust them with such functions and 
powers as are expedient for the performance of the Commission‟s 
functions. Section 4(3) permits the Commission to assign its functions to 
others on agreed terms. Section 22(5) empowers the Commission to fine 
healthcare service providers up to fifty thousand rupees for failing to 
provide or give false information to the inspection team. Section 28(1) 
authorizes the Commission to impose fines up to five hundred thousand 
rupees for contraventions of the Act, depending on the severity of the 
offence. Finally, section 31(1)(e) provides the right to appeal before the 
District and Sessions Judge against the imposition of a fine by the 
Commission. 
49. 
 
The 2016 Regulations provide for committee hearings in 
cases of violations of the PHC Act, rules, and regulations. Regulation 6 
outlines the hearing procedure, while Regulations 7(3) and 7(4) empower 
                                          
23 It is significant that the PHC Act alternates between the terms “fine” and “penalty”. For the purposes 
of the present case, it is not necessary to determine whether this reflects a deliberate distinction or if the 
terms were used interchangeably by the draftsman. The Supreme Court of Pakistan considered these 
terms in Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) v. Pakistan Telecommunication Company 
Limited (2016 SCMR 69), and explained that a “penalty” refers to a loss, disadvantage, or punishment 
imposed on an individual or their property due to their actions or omissions, covering both criminal and 
civil contexts. In criminal law, it signifies punishment, such as imprisonment or a monetary payment, 
for violating the law. In civil law, it may result from a breach of statutory duty or contractual obligation, 
though its scope and remedies vary. However, a “fine” is a specific type of penalty that involves a 
monetary payment as punishment for breaking the law. While all fines are penalties, not all penalties 
are fines. The Supreme Court observed that “both the terms “penalty” and “fine” in a statutory 
construction may sometime be used loosely but a true import of the term would obviously depend upon 
the subject matter and the object of the statutory instrument wherein such term has been employed that 
too with reference to the context in which it is used.”

the committee to impose fines for specific violations. Regulations 7(3) 
and 7(4) are reproduced below for ready reference: 
(3) 
In any case, if the Committee, after hearing the concerned 
persons, concludes that a person who is duly registered with either of 
the Councils, as mentioned in clause (xxix) of Section 2 of the Act, is 
rendering unsubstantiated and unjustified support to an unregistered 
person(s), in any manner whatsoever, then his such conduct shall be 
reported to the relevant Council, for necessary action. 
In such a situation the Committee shall impose a fine, which 
may extend to five hundred thousand rupees, upon such a person who 
was found to be practicing quackery at the said premises and the 
healthcare service provider, individually or collectively, as the case 
may be. 
(4) 
Any person who is proved to be responsible and/or involved in 
the act of quackery or who is proved to be practicing as quack(s) at any 
particular Healthcare Establishment, the Committee shall impose a fine 
upon such person, which may extend up to five hundred thousand 
rupees, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case and 
keeping in view the gravity of the offence and in the case of continuing 
failure to comply with the orders and directions, as issued to such 
person, or repetition of such illegal practice, to a further fine, which 
shall not be less than fifty thousand rupees and shall in no case exceed 
five hundred thousand rupees. 
50. 
 
The Commission has appointed Hearing Committees to 
proceed further on the reports submitted by authorized officers/teams 
against quacks/unauthorized practitioners vide notification dated 
19.9.2022. While clause (m) of section 4(2), read in conjunction with 
section 4(3) of the PHC Act, authorizes the Commission to appoint such a 
committee, the critical issue lies in defining the scope and extent of its 
powers, 
because 
a 
Hearing 
Committee 
undoubtedly 
exercises  
quasi-judicial functions when conducting its proceedings.  
51. 
 
“Processing the case” and “deciding the case” are two 
distinct actions. The case of Prof. Dr. Manzoor Hussain and others v. 
Zubaida Chaudhry and others (2023 SCMR 1311) is instructive. In that 
case, section 14(4) of the Federal Ombudsman Institutional Reforms Act 
2013 stipulated that a representation made to the President of Pakistan 
must be “processed” in the President‟s office by a person qualified to be a 
Supreme Court Judge or who has served as a Wafaqi Mohtasib or Federal 
Tax Ombudsman. The question arose as to whether, in the absence of 
explicit authority to delegate the President‟s decision-making powers, the 
term “processed” implied that these powers were delegated to the officer, 
thereby divesting the President of his authority. The Supreme Court ruled 
that the officer‟s role was limited to preparing the case and making 

Writ Petition No. 7031/2023 
 
 
 
- 21 -
recommendations, while the President retained final authority to decide 
the matter. The Court emphasized the distinction between processing and 
deciding, noting that the officer‟s role was ancillary to the President‟s 
ultimate decision-making authority. The President retains complete 
control over the decision and may, if necessary, personally hear the 
parties before issuing a ruling. The relevant excerpt is as follows: 
“It is important to note that the power to process a representation by 
preparing the case, and the power to decide that representation, after 
due application of mind, are inherently distinct functions and cannot 
be equated or conflated. The function of processing a representation 
by the nominated officer is only ancillary to the main objective of 
decision on the representation by the President. According to  
De Smith‟s Judicial Review, Courts have even conceded that an 
authority has an implied power to entrust to a group of its own 
members with the authority to investigate, to hear evidence and 
make recommendations in a report, provided that (a) it retains the 
power to make decisions in its own hands and receives a report full 
enough to enable it to comply with its duty to „hear‟ before deciding, 
and (b) the context does not indicate that it must perform the entire 
adjudicatory process itself. Where there are express statutory 
provisions to this effect, the Court has to consider whether the 
Minister or Governor or, as in this case, the President, had to act 
„judicially‟ in some respect and has failed to do so. The respect in 
which he has to observe judicial procedure or act judicially will 
depend on the statutory or other provisions under which the matter 
arises. For the purposes of the question raised in the instant matter, it 
is apparent from the provisions noted above that the President is 
specifically authorized to nominate an officer to process a 
representation by preparing the case and giving his/her views on the 
said representation, which are likely to be only in the shape of 
recommendations/proposals, as in the instant case, and in no manner 
can it be stated that the nominated officer is deciding the 
representation. The case is then placed before the President for 
decision thereon and the power to decide the representation resides 
solely with and is exercised only by the President after due 
application of mind.” 
52. 
 
Proceedings before a Hearing Committee are permissible if 
they are merely for “processing the case”, as they fall within the ambit of 
clause (m) of section 4(2) of the PHC Act. Section 28 of the PHC Act 
expressly confers the jurisdiction for adjudication of fines on the 
Commission, a power further reinforced by sections 4(2)(g), 22(5), and 
31(1)(e). A collective reading of these provisions indicates that the 
Commission is responsible for delivering the final verdict in any given 
case. As the PHC Act currently stands, it does not permit delegating this 
adjudicative power to the Hearing Committees. 
53. 
 
It is well established that the State enforces its legislative 
policy through both primary and subordinate legislation, but such 

Writ Petition No. 7031/2023 
 
 
 
- 22 -
legislation must always remain within the bounds of the Constitution. 
Besides being constitutionally valid, subordinate legislation must align 
with the authority granted by the parent Act. Therefore, no rule that 
contradicts the parent statute can be enacted, and no regulation may 
conflict with either the parent statute or the rules made under it. Any 
provisions of the rules or regulations inconsistent with the parent statute 
or rules shall be deemed inoperative to the extent of such inconsistency.24 
A statutory rule cannot expand the scope of the section under which it is 
framed. If a rule goes beyond what the section contemplates, the rule must 
yield to the statute. The rule-making authority cannot assume powers not 
granted by the statute.25 The general power of rules cannot be used to 
widen the purposes of the Act or to add new and different means for 
carrying out or to depart from and vary its terms.26 
54. 
 
The power to impose fines is a significant quasi-judicial 
function that cannot be delegated to subordinate bodies without explicit 
authorization from the parent statute. The second paragraph of Regulation 
7(3) and Regulation 7(4) of the 2016 Regulations, which allow the 
Hearing Committees to impose fines, exceeds the scope of the PHC Act. 
They are also inconsistent with the principles of delegation outlined by  
De Smith (referred to in paragraph 42). De Smith‟s principles assert that 
the nature of the delegated power also affects the delegation‟s validity. 
Quasi-judicial functions like imposing fines, which directly impact 
individual rights and require deliberate judgment, should not be delegated 
informally. Since the PHC Act, as adumbrated, does not expressly 
authorize the delegation of such significant powers to the Hearing 
Committee, this delegation violates established principles. Furthermore, 
Smith‟s principles highlight that delegating discretionary powers to a 
subordinate body without proper supervisory control renders the 
delegation invalid. In the context of the PHC Act, the Commission has

improperly delegated its power to impose fines to the Hearing Committee 
without adequate oversight. The committee‟s decisions should be subject 
to review or ratification by the Commission to ensure that the ultimate 
responsibility for quasi-judicial decisions remains with it. Lastly,  
De Smith emphasizes that the degree of control maintained by the 
delegating authority is critical in determining the validity of the 
delegation. It must retain the power to review or reject the delegate‟s 
decisions. In the present case, the delegation is flawed because the 
Hearing Committee has the final say in imposing fines without the 
Commission‟s oversight. It leaves the Commission with no control over 
this quasi-judicial power.

Interestingly, the Commission has also framed the Punjab 
Healthcare Commission Complaint Management Regulations, 2014. 
Under Regulation 21 thereof, the Competent Authority is required to 
submit the case before the Commission during a Board meeting, based on 
the recommendations of the Complaint Management Sub-committee, for a 
decision regarding penalties and the suspension or revocation of a licence. 
The Commission‟s Legal Advisor, Mr. Durrani, has failed to explain why 
the 2016 Regulations prescribe a different procedure that deviates from 
the settled law.

The principle of reading down a statutory provision is a well-
established rule of interpretation. It is grounded in the assumption that the 
legislature would not intend to enact an invalid law. This approach 
equally applies to subordinate legislation, as the subordinate legislating 
authority is not expected to frame rules/regulations in violation of the 
parent Act or any other statute. In Province of Punjab v. Saleem Ijaz and 
others (2023 SCMR 774), the Supreme Court of Pakistan observed: 
“This rule [of reading down] avoids striking down of statute or rule 
which carries curable constitutional or legal vice and instead by reading 
them down achieves to harmonize the statute or the rule with the 
general scheme of the Act and the Rules.27 It is a rule of harmonious 
construction under a different name. It is generally used to straighten 
the crudities or ironing out the creases to make a statute or a rule 
workable. The rule of reading down is used for a limited purpose of 
making a particular provision workable and to bring it in harmony with 
other provisions of the statutes.28”

Applying the above principle, the second paragraph of 
Regulation 7(3) and Regulation 7(4) of the 2016 Regulations must be read 
down, and the phrase “Committee shall impose a fine” should mean that 
on the conclusion of the proceedings, the Hearing Committee shall place 
the case before the Commission for a final decision which may impose a 
fine. 
58. 
 
As adumbrated, Regulation 7(4) also empowers the Hearing 
Committee to impose an additional fine in the event of continuing failure 
to comply with the orders and directions or repetition of the illegal 
practice of quackery. This portion of Regulation 7(4) cannot be saved by 
applying the principle of reading down. It is, therefore, declared  
ultra vires and struck down. 
The case at hand 
59. 
 
In the present case, proceedings against the Petitioner were 
initiated based on Census Data and a complaint by Dr. Mahmood Khan. 
The PHC Officials, consisting of two Programme Officers (Enforcement), 
Muhammad Jawad Khalil and Suleman Ahmad Khan, were duly 
authorized to check the Petitioner and determine whether he was engaged 
in quackery, which is prohibited by law. These officials conducted 
inspections on 25.11.2022, 7.12.2022, 9.12.2022, and 15.2.2023. In light 
of the above discussion regarding Questions I and II, the Petitioner‟s 
objections to the legality of the inspection and sealing of the premises are 
overruled. 
60. 
 
I have concluded that the Commission can delegate its power 
to hear a complaint/report submitted by the Visiting/Reporting Officer to 
a committee under Regulation 6, which may conduct the hearing and 
present its findings to the Commission for a final verdict. However, I have 
upheld the Petitioner‟s contention that, under section 28, read with section 
4(2)(g) of the PHC Act, only the Commission can impose a fine on 
individuals found guilty of practising quackery. The Hearing Committee 
is not authorized to do so. Therefore, its order dated 8.5.2023 is without 
jurisdiction in the present case. The District and Sessions Judge, Lodhran, 
failed to appreciate this aspect while delivering the judgment dated 
26.8.2023.

In view of the above, the judgment dated 26.8.2023 and the 
order dated 8.5.2023 supra are hereby set aside. The case is remanded to 
the Commission, which is directed to reconsider the matter and render a 
fresh decision following the legal principles discussed.
