C.M.No.1-C of 2023 
  
The subject appeal, filed under 
section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the 
‘Code’), is directed against the ex-parte judgment 
and decree dated 21.12.2021 passed by learned Civil 
Judge 1st Class, Rawalpindi, whereby, the suit for 
specific performance and injunction, instituted by 
the appellant, has been dismissed. The appeal is 
accompanied by the instant application dated 
08.02.2023 (the ‘application’) seeking to exclude 
the period for pursuing the remedy before forum 
without jurisdiction i.e. the learned District Court, 
Rawalpindi. 
2.  
 
Mr. Muhammad Asghar Gondal, 
learned counsel for the applicant / appellant, during 
the arguments, has reiterated the contents of the 
application and relevant part of the same is as 
follows: - 
“2. That the applicant / appellant filed an 
appeal before the Learned District Judge 

 
RFA No. 51 of 2023         (Order) 
 
 
2 
Rawalpindi as per the appellant is proper 
forum of the Learned District Judge 
Rawalpindi but lateron the Learned Addl. 
District Judge asked the appellant that the 
appeal was not maintainable due to the 
proper jurisdiction of the District Judge 
Rawalpindi, hence the case was return to 
the appellant to file for the proper forum 
before this honorable Court. 
 
3. That the decision of case on merits is 
always to be encouraged instead of non 
suiting the litigants for technical reasons 
including on limitation.”   
 
3.  
 
There is no cavil to the settled 
proposition of law that where the plaint is returned 
under Order VII, Rule 10 of the Code for its 
representation before the Court of competent 
jurisdiction, for all intent and purposes, it is treated 
as a fresh institution. The suit for specific 
performance 
of 
agreement 
dated 
18.04.2017 
involving consideration of Rs.61,200,000/- was 
dismissed by the learned Civil Court vide impugned 
judgment and decree dated 21.12.2021. Instead of 
filing appeal before this Court, an appeal was 
instituted before the learned District Court, 
Rawalpindi which remained pending for about one 
year and finally the appeal was returned under Order 
VII, Rule 10 of the Code vide order dated 
08.02.2023 passed by the learned District Court, 
Rawalpindi.  
4. 
 
The application, for excluding the 
period of pursing the remedy before the learned 
Court lacking jurisdiction, is instituted under section 
5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 (the ‘Act’) which 

 
RFA No. 51 of 2023         (Order) 
 
 
3 
requires a litigant to satisfy the Court that he has 
sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or 
making the application within the stipulated time 
period. In order to establish ‘sufficient cause’, there 
is no mathematical formula or hard and fast rule that 
can be followed, however, it is equally an 
established principle that although section 14 of the 
Act has no direct application to the appeals but the 
principles enumerated therein can be taken into the 
consideration by the Court while ascertaining the 
availability of ‘sufficient cause’ for condonation of 
delay. Reference can be made to the case titled 
“Khushi Muhammad through L.Rs. and Others 
Versus Mst. Fazal Bibi and Others” (PLD 2016 
Supreme Court 872). It will be beneficial to 
reproduce the relevant extract from the said 
judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court of 
Pakistan, which reads as follows:-  
 
 
“37. The purpose of the laws of 
limitation is to establish certainty in the 
affairs of men, to bring repose and to 
bring an end to litigation after a certain 
time period has expired from accrual of an 
actionable right. Both Sections 5 and 14 of 
the Act are exceptions to the laws of 
limitation. A person claiming under the 
aforesaid exceptions must establish that he 
or 
she 
is 
not 
disentitled 
to 
the 
discretionary relief which may be awarded 
by the Court. Therefore a claimant seeking 
condonation of delay must explain the 
delay of each and every day to the 
satisfaction of the Court, establish that the 
delay was caused by reasons beyond the 
person’s (or counsel’s) control and that he 
was not indolent, negligent or careless in 
initiating and pursuing the actionable 

 
RFA No. 51 of 2023         (Order) 
 
 
4 
right which had accrued in his favour. The 
“borrowed” applicability of the provisions 
of Section 14, where its principles are 
taken into account to set the standard for 
sufficient 
cause, 
proceeds 
on 
the 
conditions precedent of due diligence and 
good faith which must be present before 
the court grants condonation of delay on 
the basis of time spent before wrong fora; 
even if such principles are not taken into 
consideration the court is not supposed to 
exercise its discretion in any arbitrary, 
whimsical and fanciful manner but has to 
see if a case was made out by the appellant 
which prevented and precluded him from 
approaching the right forum of appeal. 
The overwhelming case law cited in the 
earlier part of this opinion concludes that 
the institution and the pendency of an 
appeal before a wrong forum on counsel’s 
wrong 
advice 
i.e. 
one 
having 
no 
jurisdiction does not constitute a sufficient 
cause for condonation of delay in terms of 
Section 5 of the Act, but there is 
considerable case law that supports the 
contrary view. In my opinion, the gulf 
betwixt the divergent views must be 
bridged by employing proportionality and 
balancing. It can neither be held that 
condonation is absolutely ruled out in such 
a situation nor that the appellant shall be 
entitled to condonation as a matter of 
course and right, rather the Court must 
look into the facts  and circumstances of 
each as to whether sufficient cause has 
been made out. Because any exercise of 
discretionary jurisdiction in favour of a 
person 
seeking 
relaxation 
of 
the 
application of the laws of limitation as of 
right etc. would be prejudicial to the 
interests of the respondent. A valuable 
vested right accrues in favour of the 
respondent the moment a relevant period 
of limitation expires in that the respondent 
is then free from the hanging sword of an 
actionable claim. In order to wrest away 
this valuable right from a respondent the 

 
RFA No. 51 of 2023         (Order) 
 
 
5 
person seeking condonation of delay must 
establish 
sufficient 
cause. 
However, 
sufficient cause is a term wide enough to 
encompass 
within 
it 
the 
principles 
enshrined in Section 14 of the Act or 
indeed independent thereto. Time spent 
pursuing an appeal before a wrong forum, 
in good faith and with due diligence ought 
in our view to constitute sufficient cause 
for condonation of delay. But the act of 
approaching a wrong forum must be 
accounted for: It should be established 
that due to some honest, bona fide and  
genuine ambiguity in the law or in fact, a 
party or his counsel was led astray in 
terms of approaching a wrong forum. 
Mere 
incompetence 
of 
the 
counsel, 
inadvertence, negligence or ignorance of 
law attributable to him and / or 
overlooking of the record by the counsel 
cannot constitute sufficient cause ipso 
facto, but the factor (s) which misled the 
legal counsel, including any ambiguity in 
the law, causing him to file the appeal 
before the wrong forum must be indicated. 
Mere wrong advice of counsel is not an 
adequate ground per se to constitute 
sufficient cause because if this rule is 
accepted, the centuries tested rule that 
ignorance of law is no excuse would stand 
violated. Besides, the above factors which 
caused ambiguity and misled the appellant 
(or his counsel as the case may be) have to 
be stated with clarity and precision in the 
application for condonation of delay and 
proved on the record.” 
 
 
 
 
(Underlining is added) 
 
5.  
Here it will be appropriate to reproduce 
section 14 of the Act, which reads as follows: - 
 
 
“Exclusion 
of 
time 
of 
proceeding bona fide in Court without 
jurisdiction.  
 
(1) In computing the period of 
limitation prescribed for any suit the time 

 
RFA No. 51 of 2023         (Order) 
 
 
6 
during which the plaintiff has been 
prosecuting with due diligence another 
civil proceeding, whether in a Court of 
first instance or in a Court of appeal, 
against the defendant, shall be excluded, 
where the proceeding is founded upon the 
same cause of action and is prosecuted in 
good faith in a Court which, from defect of 
jurisdiction, or other cause of a like 
nature, is unable to entertain it.  
  
(2). 
In computing the period of 
limitation prescribed for any application 
the time during which the application has 
been prosecuting with due diligence 
another civil proceeding whether in a 
Court of first instance or in a Court of 
appeal, against the same party for the 
same relief shall be excluded, where such 
proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in 
a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction, 
or other cause of a like nature is unable to 
entertain it.” 
 
 
 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
 
6.  
 
Reading of above clearly reflects 
that it is incumbent upon the litigant, seeking 
exclusion of time period for pursuing remedy in 
forum without jurisdiction, to plead the facts to 
justify the grant of relief and by reasonably 
demonstrating due diligence and good faith in 
pursuing the matter before the learned Court having 
no jurisdiction to adjudicate.  
7. 
 
The initial burden, to show the 
above elements for seeking to exclude the period 
consumed in prosecuting case before learned forum 
without jurisdiction, is on the applicant pleading 
such relief. Reliance in this regard can be placed on 
the law settled by the Honourable Supreme Court as 
well as this Court in cases titled “Khushi 

 
RFA No. 51 of 2023         (Order) 
 
 
7 
Muhammad through L.Rs. and Others” (supra), 
“Monazah Parveen Versus Bashir Ahmad and 6 
Others” (2003 SCMR 1300) and “Abdul Ghani 
Versus Mst. Mussarat Rehana” (1985 CLC 2529).  
8. 
 
Reverting to the facts of the case, 
the applicant / appellant miserably failed to plead 
the elements of section 14 of the Act. No plea as to 
the bonafide on the part of the applicant / appellant 
or any due diligence on his part has been taken in 
the application or during the arguments. The learned 
counsel for the applicant / appellant besides 
reiterating the contents of the application, which are 
already reproduced above, failed to give any 
justification or to argue as to due diligence adopted 
by the appellant for about one year of pursuing the 
remedy in wrong forum.  
9. 
 
The circumstances of the case did 
not involve or present any difficulty in ascertaining 
correct forum having jurisdiction to hear the appeal. 
The error of filing the appeal before the learned 
District Court, Rawalpindi is fairly obvious and it 
could have been avoided by exercising even little 
diligence or adopting some care. A learned Division 
Bench of this Court, somewhat in similar 
circumstances of the present, in “Abdul Ghani” case 
(supra) has observed that in such circumstances 
even the wrong advice of a counsel cannot be 
foundation for enlargement of time consumed in 
pursuing remedy before wrong forum. The relevant 
part of the said judgment is as under: - 
 

 
RFA No. 51 of 2023         (Order) 
 
 
8 
 
“We are of the view, that the error 
in filing the appeal in the District Court is 
so patent, that it could have been avoided 
by exercising due care. The wrong advice 
of a counsel does not furnish a 
foundation for enlargement of time. A 
reference in this connection may be made 
to Abdul Ghani v. Ghulam Sarwar PLD 
1977 SC 102, which is on all fours on the 
case in hand.”  
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
10.  
 
The conduct of the applicant / 
appellant depicts carelessness, lack of required 
diligence and callous approach on the basis of which 
condonation of delay under section 5 of the Act is 
sought, without even discharging the initial burden 
or even pleading necessary ingredients. Further 
reference can be made to the cases titled “Sarmukh 
Singh Vs Channan Singh and Ors (AIR 1960 PH 
512) and “Munshi v. Punna Ram” (AIR 1974 
Punjab and Haryana 229). 
11.  
 
As far as the contention of learned 
counsel for the applicant / appellant that the cases 
should be decided on the basis of merits rather than 
technicalities is concerned, it is suffice to observe 
that availing the remedy within the period provided 
by law is not merely a technicality. Section 5 or 
section 14 of the Act are not intended to add 
premium to the carelessness or to validate lack of 
vigilance and required caution by a litigant.  
 
 
     12. 
 
In the wake of above discussion, we 
are of the considered opinion that the application, 
for enlargement of time by excluding the time 

 
RFA No. 51 of 2023         (Order) 
 
 
9 
period of about one year for pursuing remedy before 
wrong forum, has no substance, therefore, the same 
is dismissed.  
 
 
 
 
 
Main Appeal 
  
 
13.  
 
For the foregoing reason the present 
appeal is dismissed in limine, being barred by time. 
No order as to costs.
