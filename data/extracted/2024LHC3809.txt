Mian 
Tariq 
Hussain, 
Advocate 
for 
petitioner. 
This revision petition is directed 
against 
judgment 
and 
decree 
dated 
03.10.2023 and 31.1.2024 by which the 
suit of the respondent was decreed and 
petitioner’s 
appeal 
thereagainst 
was 
dismissed. 
2.   Respondent instituted a suit for 
declaration and cancellation of 
sale 
mutation No.672 dated 07.11.2018 with 
regard to a residential plot in ihata No.74/1 
at chak No.334 GB, Pir Mahal District 
Toba Tek Singh. It was alleged in the 
plaint that the respondent plaintiff was an 
octogenarian widow who did not have any 
male heir and that her maternal grandson, 
the present petitioner Muhammad Umar 
Farooq, in collaboration with his father 
Majid 
Ali 
had, 
by 
fraud 
and 
misrepresentation, got the mutation of sale 

 C.R. No.13867 of 2024 
 
               -2- 
 
 
entered qua her property in his favour 
showing 
alleged 
consideration 
of 
Rs.3,50,000/- which sale was neither ever 
entered into by the respondent/plaintiff nor 
was any such payment made or received 
whatsoever and that in the circumstances 
the mutation was liable to be cancelled 
being 
a 
product 
of 
fraud 
and 
misrepresentation. The petitioner filed a 
contesting written statement in which the 
contents of the plaint were denied and it 
was asserted that the respondent had in 
fact alienated the property to him by way 
of sale for Rs.3,50,000/- which amount 
was paid and received as consideration and 
that the petitioner as a result had become 
absolute owner and that the suit was 
brought without cause and with mala fide. 
Out of divergent pleadings the following 
issues were formulated: 
“1. Whether the plaintiff is owner in possession 
over the suit property and impugned mutation 
No.672 dated 07.11.2018 is illegal, against law 
and facts, fraud, contusive and in-effective 
upon the rights of the plaintiff and are liable to 
be concealed? OPP 
2. If above issue is answered in affirmative, then 
whether the plaintiff is entitled for decree of 
declaration, cancellation of mutation and 
permanent injunction as prayed for? OPP 
3. Whether plaintiff has no cause of action and 
locus standi to file instant suit? OPD 

 C.R. No.13867 of 2024 
 
               -3- 
 
 
4. Whether the suit is not maintainable in its 
present form? OPD 
5. Whether the plaintiff is estopped by her words 
and conduct to file this suit? OPD 
6. Whether the suit of the plaintiff has not come to 
the court with clean hand? OPD 
7. Whether the suit is false and frivolous, hence 
the defendant is entitled to special costs u/s 
35-A CPC? OPD 
8.  Relief.” 
To substantiate her stance the respondent 
produced four witnesses including herself 
in the witness-box as PW-1 and one 
Shahida Parveen adduced evidence as  
PW-2 while Maqbool Hussain appeared as 
PW-3 and Muhammad Basheer as PW-4. 
The petitioner Muhammad Umar Farooq 
himself appeared as DW-1 and produced 
one Israr Hussain as DW-2, Muhammad 
Shahid as DW-3 and one Khaliq Dar 
(previous Naib Tehsildar, Pir Mahal) as 
DW-4. He also produced attested copy of 
pert-sarkar mutation No.672 as Exh.D-2 
and attested copy of mutation No.672 pert-
patwar as Exh.D-3. After considering the 
evidence pro and contra the learned Civil 
Judge, Pir Mahal vide judgment dated 
03.10.2023 decreed the suit of the 
respondent. Petitioner preferred an appeal 
thereagainst which too was dismissed by 

 C.R. No.13867 of 2024 
 
               -4- 
 
 
the learned Addl. District Judge, Pir Mahal 
vide judgment dated 31.1.2024. Both these 
decisions of the courts below are now 
challenged in revisional jurisdiction. 
3.     Scrutiny of the appended documents 
and particularly the plaint shows that 
existence of the sale transaction is denied 
in absolute terms and it is specifically 
asserted that she neither entered into any 
such 
transaction 
nor 
received 
any 
consideration for it which were adequate 
averments to fulfill the legal requirement 
qua specificity with regard to allegation of 
fraud in the peculiar circumstances that the 
widow was illiterate pardanasheen who 
was above eighty years of age. The setting 
in which the alleged transaction is placed 
is germane to consideration the case. The 
appended 
documents 
show 
that 
the 
respondent is over 80 years of age. She did 
not have any male progeny. Petitioner 
Muhammad Umar Farooq is the son of her 
only daughter who used to reside with her. 
His father divorced his mother who had 
subsequently apparently remarried and was 
settled at Layyah. The father of the 

 C.R. No.13867 of 2024 
 
               -5- 
 
 
petitioner defendant is also co-owner of 
ihata No.74/1 which comprises total of 11-
M and 7-S and also appears to live in the 
neighborhood 
of 
the 
house 
of 
the 
respondent 
lady 
and 
that 
she 
was 
dependent emotionally and practically on 
the able-bodied petitioner grandson who 
was living with her and in such context the 
transaction alleged to be made in favour of 
the petitioner by the respondent widow 
statedly occurred.  
4.  
The witnesses produced by the 
respondent plaintiff duly elaborated the 
circumstances qua such residence of the 
petitioner with the respondent widow as 
well as the dependence of the old illiterate 
lady on her grandson, the petitioner 
beneficiary of the alleged transaction. The 
nearness of the relationship of the 
petitioner with the respondent elderly 
widow as her grandson, the factum of him 
residing in the same house with her to the 
exclusion of anybody else coupled with 
absence of any independent advice being 
established 
on 
record 
placed 
heavy 
responsibility upon the shoulders of the 

 C.R. No.13867 of 2024 
 
               -6- 
 
 
petitioner to establish the existence of the 
sale 
transaction 
by 
independent 
unimpeachable, creditworthy and coherent 
evidence.  
5.  
The witnesses produced by the 
petitioner failed to provide any probative 
tenability qua assertion of the alleged oral 
sale nor could any evidence be brought on 
record to prove that any payment as 
alleged was ever made to her. So much so 
that at the time of the transaction which 
was alleged to have been made in 2018, 
the petitioner was 20 years of age and was 
not employed anywhere nor did he have 
any source of income to come up with 
such amount of payment for purchasing 
the property as asserted. As such he 
miserably failed on this score to prove that 
any 
consideration 
was 
ever 
paid. 
Furthermore the cloud of undue influence 
and colorability of the transaction could 
also not be effectively rebutted by 
establishing any plausible factual context 
of the alleged transaction such as proof of 
any negotiations with regard to sale, how 
the price was agreed and how the payment 

 C.R. No.13867 of 2024 
 
               -7- 
 
 
was to be made or was made to the 
respondent widow and in whose presence. 
In Ghulam Farid and another v. Sher 
Rehman through LRs (2016 SCMR  862)  
it was observed to the effect that the 
inflexible, hard and fast rule is that when 
any transaction is made by any one where  
vital interest of a pardanasheen lady is 
involved then the following conditions are 
to be invariably and essentially fulfilled: 
“14… 
(i). 
to establish through evidence that the 
transaction was free from any influence, 
misrepresentation or fraud; 
(ii). 
that, the amount of consideration equal 
to the value of the property was indeed paid to 
the ladies; 
(iii). 
in the case of “Parda Nasheen” rustic 
village ladies, at the time of transaction such 
ladies were fully made to understand the nature 
of the transaction and the consequences, 
emanating therefrom and; 
(iv). 
that at the time of transaction, the ladies 
were having access to independent advice of 
their nearer and dearer, who have no hostile 
interest to them.” 
In the case of Pervaiz Akhtar v. Mst. 
Farida Bibi and others (PLD 2023 SC 
628) it was observed as under: 
“8. 
In the case of a transaction with 
Pardanashin woman, a principle of caution is 
attached to the transaction to protect her rights. It 
is necessary that a Pardanashin woman is fully 
cognizant and aware of the transaction and that 
she has independent advice from a reliable 
source to understand the nature of the 
transaction; there must be witnesses to the 
transaction and to the fact that a Pardanashin 
woman has received the sale consideration. Most 
importantly, a Pardanashin woman must know to 
whom she is selling her property and the 

 C.R. No.13867 of 2024 
 
               -8- 
 
 
transaction must be explained to her in the 
language she fully understands as is held in the 
cases reported as Ghulam Farid and another v. 
Sher Rehman through LRs (2016 SCMR 862) 
and Ghulam Muhammad v. Zohran Bibi and 
others (2021 SCMR 19). In a case where  a 
Pardanashin woman has trusted a relative and 
executed a general power of attorney for her to 
sell the property, it is still incumbent upon the 
power 
of 
attorney 
holder 
to 
fulfil 
the 
aforementioned conditions of making the 
Pardanashin woman aware of the sale that is 
about to be executed under the power of 
attorney. This is because the underlying principle 
here is to ensure that at all times where a woman 
executes a transaction with reference to her 
property, it is done freely and deliberately … In 
Muhammad Naeem Khan and another v. 
Muqadas Khan (deceased)  through L.Rs. and 
another (PLD 2022 SC 99) that the objective of 
this court  has been to protect Pardanashin 
women from the risk of an unfair deal and to 
ensure that any transaction related to the sale of 
their property is effected by free will and with 
consent. We have also held that wherever there 
is a transaction with Pardanashin women, it must 
be established that they were given independent, 
impartial and objective advice understanding all 
implications and ramifications of the transaction 
to ensure that they give their consent to the 
transaction, because valuable rights are involved 
and the Pardanashin women should be able to 
make an informed decision with reference to their 
property with the help of proper advice and 
consultation.  This Court has also held in the 
case reported as Mian Allah Ditta through L.Rs v. 
Mst. Sakina Bibi and others (2013 SCMR 868)  
that the burden of proof lies on the person 
exercising the power of attorney to prove that the 
transaction was carried out in good faith and with 
full knowledge and consent and grantor. Hence, 
the mere fact that Pardanashin women execute a 
general power of attorney will not absolve the 
attorney nor the buyer of the obligation to ensure 
that the Pardanashin women have full knowledge 
of the sale and have given their consent to the 
sale… 
9. 
The concept of protecting the rights of 
Pardanashin women finds its root in the cultural 
practice of women staying within the protection of 
their home, having limited access to affairs 
outside their home. Consequently, such women 
have limited interaction with society and do not 
participate in matters outside their home. This 
suggests that their knowledge and information 
about matters outside their home is limited and 
insufficient 
to 
take 
informed 
decisions. 
Accordingly, the courts have protected the rights 
of such women in order to protect them from 
betrayal, exploitation and fraud especially where 
valuable property rights are concerned. The 
concept of an illiterate woman is similar to that of 

 C.R. No.13867 of 2024 
 
               -9- 
 
 
a Pardanashin woman as both lack education 
and basic knowledge of worldly affairs and both 
interact essentially at a limited level with society. 
This limited participation hampers her ability to 
take informed decisions. Such women are 
perceived as being unskilled, uneducated and 
incompetent so far as the business matters are 
concerned. They lack experience and are easily 
susceptible to deceit even by their relatives. The 
courts endeavour to protect Pardanashin or 
illiterate women due to their social standing and 
vulnerability not only from society at large but 
also from relatives. Women are often the targets 
of fraud and deceit when it comes to property 
matters, which is why the courts have invoked 
the principle of caution in protecting the rights of 
such women so that they are not wrongfully 
deprived of their property. The limitations of 
Pardanashin or illiterate women have been duly 
considered by the courts against which the courts 
have held that such women must be given 
independent advice from a reliable and 
trustworthy source so as to ensure that they fully 
understand 
the 
transaction 
and 
the 
consequences of that transaction. In Muhammad 
Naeem 
Khan’s 
case 
(supra) 
we 
have 
categorically 
stated 
that 
whenever 
the 
authenticity or genuineness of a transaction 
entered into by a Pardanashin woman is disputed 
or claimed to have been secured on the basis of 
fraud or misrepresentation, the burden will lie on 
the beneficiary of that transaction to prove good 
faith and more importantly, the Court will 
consider whether the transaction was entered 
into with free will or under duress. It goes without 
saying that the effort to protect rights of 
Pardanashin and illiterate women is necessary 
so as to give such women the ability to make 
independent decisions with reference to their 
property or belongings so as to ensure that they 
are not deprived of the ability to take a good 
decision based on their social standing in society. 
This is a step towards ensuring that there is an 
element 
of 
financial 
and 
economical 
independence given to women, who have been 
deprived of education and have limited 
interaction within the home and the family. While 
this may be the customary or traditional role of 
women as seen by society in general, the 
endeavour of the Court has always been to 
protect the vulnerability and susceptibility of 
women”.   
6. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner on 
being confronted with this has relied on the 
objection that where connivance of revenue 
officials in attestation of any mutation is 

 C.R. No.13867 of 2024 
 
               -10- 
 
 
asserted, their impleadment as party is 
necessary, and not having done so shall be 
fatal to the case of the respondent. In this 
regard reliance is placed on Sikandar Hayat 
and another v. Sughran Bibi and 6 others 
(2020 SCMR 214) and Sakhi Jan and others 
v. Shah Nawaz and another (2020 SCMR 
832). It is noteworthy that the sale 
transaction alleged to have been made in the 
instant case in favour of the petitioner is by a 
pardanasheen lady who was not only 
illiterate 
and 
dependent 
upon 
him 
emotionally and practically as her maternal 
grandson living with her but was also an 
octogenarian which made it pivotal for the 
transaction to be independently established 
by the petitioner in which he miserably failed 
after shifting of onus as its beneficiary. In 
Ghulam Muhammad v. Zohran Bibi and 
others (2021 SCMR 19) it was held to the 
effect that impleading revenue officials in 
every case was not a rule of the thumb and 
that this depends upon the peculiar facts and 
circumstances of each case and that in the 
event that the concerned court comes to the 
conclusion that revenue functionaries needed 

 C.R. No.13867 of 2024 
 
               -11- 
 
 
to be impleaded to enable it to arrive at a just 
conclusion an appropriate order may be 
passed and that where sufficient evidence 
was available to establish fraud and dislodge 
mutation which had clearly been maneuvered 
on the basis of fraud, impersonation and 
misrepresentation involving an illiterate an 
elderly and illiterate pardanasheen lady who 
had no independent advice the onus had to be 
discharged by the beneficiaries for the legal 
survival of such transaction. In the instant 
case it is evident that the oral sale transaction 
which is basis of the mutation was non-
existent as no evidence to establish the same 
beyond the shadow of doubt could be 
adduced by the petitioner. The precedents 
cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner 
in the circumstances of the case, evidence on 
record and peculiarity of circumstances are 
distinguishable. Both courts below duly 
scrutinized the evidence carefully and 
concluded that the petitioner had failed in 
establishing the sale transaction to put up a 
valid defence against the respondent to her 
plea of having been victim of fraud and 
misrepresentation. No instance of misreading 

 C.R. No.13867 of 2024 
 
               -12- 
 
 
or non-reading of evidence or any illegality 
in the process of arriving at their judgments 
by the courts below could be shown to exist 
and on careful consideration the conclusions 
drawn are found to be fair, reasonable and 
legally tenable and no case for interference in 
concurrently recorded findings of the courts 
below could be made out in revisional 
jurisdiction. Resultantly, the revision petition 
is meritless which is, accordingly, dismissed.
