Writ Petition No.57371 of 2023 
(Nazar Muhammad vs. DPO, etc.) 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing: 
19.10.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Mian Ali Raza Sarwar, Advocate. 
State by: 
Mr. Shahid Nawab Cheema, Assistant 
Advocate General. 
Respondents No.5 &

Rai Atif Sher Kharal, Advocate. 
 
 
ALI ZIA BAJWA, J.:- Through this petition 
filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 (hereinafter ‘the Constitution’), the petitioner seeks recovery of the 
alleged detenue namely Mst. Yasmin (daughter of the petitioner) from the 
illegal and improper custody of respondents No.5 and 6.  
2. 
Arguments heard and the record available on the file perused. 
3. 
 
There are two important moot points raised by the learned 
counsel for the petitioner. The first one is that respondent No.5 Muhammad 
Zahid is guilty of the offence of rape as he has contracted and consummated 
the marriage with a minor girl/detenue and the second that being a minor, 
Mst. Yasmeen, the alleged detenue, was not competent to get her statement 
recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
(‘Cr.P.C.’)  
4. 
 
As far as the first moot point is concerned, perusal of the record 
reflects that respondent No.5 contracted marriage with the daughter of the 
petitioner. According to the petitioner’s own version at the time of her 

2 
Writ Petition No.57371/2023 
 
marriage, his daughter was 13/14 years old and she was not legally competent 
to enter into a bond of marriage. I have perused the statement of Mst. 
Yasmeen Bibi, got recorded before the Magistrate under Section 164 Cr.P.C. 
in which she categorically stated that her age is 19 years. If for the sake of 
arguments, the statement of the petitioner is considered correct, that Mst. 
Yasmeen was of 13/14 years of age at the time of her Nikah with respondent 
No.5, even then respondent No.5 cannot be held guilty of the offence of rape. 
It has been settled since long that when a girl marries after attaining puberty, 
said marriage cannot be considered a ‘void marriage’, even if she has not 
attained the minimum legal age provided under any law for the time being in 
force. The age of puberty, under different ‘Schools of Thought’, varies, 
however, as per the ‘Hanafi’ school of thought, the minimum age for a girl to 
attain puberty is 9 years. In this regard, reference can be made to the decision 
of the Supreme Court in Yousuf Masih alias Bagga Masih1. In the said case, 
it was categorically held by the Supreme Court as under:- 
“…All the original texts of Hanafi jurisprudence are 
unanimous on the point that 9 years is the minimum age on 
which the declaration of a girl about her puberty can be 
accepted. For example Allama Shami, the well known Hanafi 
jursit, writes in his Radd-ul-Muhtar, volume 5,---page 107 . . . . 
And the minimum age of puberty for a boy is 12 years and for a 
girl is 9 years.  
In the case in hand, even as per the version of the petitioner, the age of her 
daughter Mst. Yasmeen was about 13/14 years at the time of her marriage. 
Keeping in view the principles of Islamic Law as reiterated in the Yousaf 
Masih alias Bagga supra, Mst. Yasmeen has already reached an age where 
she can attain puberty. Now the question arises as to how it will be 
determined whether a girl has attained puberty or not. This query was also 
answered in Yousaf Masih alias Bagga supra that when a girl after reaching 
the minimum age of puberty declares that she has attained puberty, her 
declaration would be accepted as correct unless and until rebutted by cogent 
and convincing legal evidence. The relevant extract of the judgment has been 
reproduced infra:- 
“…And the minimum age of puberty for a boy is 12 years and for a 
girl is 9 years. Therefore, if they reach this age and declare that they 
                                                          
1 Yousuf Masih alias Bagga Masih and another vs. The State – 1994 SCMR 2102 

3 
Writ Petition No.57371/2023 
 
have attained puberty, their statement can be relied upon if there is 
nothing apparent to falsify them…” 
I have minutely perused the case file but could not find anything contrary to 
the stance of Mst. Yasmeen to falsify her declaration. Thus, her declaration in 
this regard would be deemed true. 
5. 
 
Now I come to the next point regarding the consequences of 
marrying a girl who has not yet attained the minimum age provided by the 
law to enter into a matrimonial contract. In this regard, suffice it to say that it 
is a consistent view of Constitutional Courts of our Country that if a person 
marries an underage girl, the relevant law providing punishment for such an 
act is the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 (hereinafter ‘the Act of 1929’). 
In Mst. Bakhshi2, an appeal was filed in the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
against the decision of West Pakistan High Court, Lahore Bench, by which 
the High Court got recovered the daughter of the appellant from her custody 
and allowed the girl to go with her husband. It was contended by the said 
appellant that her daughter was minor and had not attained the minimum age 
provided by the Act of 1929, hence she was not competent to enter into a 
nuptial bond and the High Court had erred in letting her go with her husband. 
The Supreme Court strongly repelled the contention of the said appellant by 
holding that punishment for marrying an underage girl has been provided by 
the Act of 1929 but such marriage cannot be termed as invalid merely 
because the girl had not attained the minimum age provided under that Act. 
The relevant portion of the judgment has been provided below:- 
“…It is true that the said Act does not permit the marriage of a girl 
below the age of 16 years, but if a girl below the age of 16 years 
marries in violation of that law, the marriage itself does not become 
invalid on that score, although a adult husband contracting the 
marriage or the persons who have solemnized the marriage maybe 
held criminally liable.” 
This principle has been expounded and reiterated in a chain of judgments3 of 
the Constitutional Courts of our Country ruling thereby that such marriage 
cannot be invalidated on this ground and the only consequence provided

Writ Petition No.57371/2023 
 
under the Act of 1929 is punishment of imprisonment to a person who 
marries such underage girl. The contention of the learned counsel for the 
petitioner that respondent No.5 has committed an offence of rape punishable 
under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter ‘PPC’) is 
based on a wrong assumption that being minor, consent of Mst. Yasmeen to 
marry respondent No.5 and consummation of marriage would not matter 
because Section 375 PPC provides that a sexual act with a girl under sixteen 
years of age will amount to rape irrespective of her consent. In this regard, 
suffice it to say that the sexual offence mentioned in Section 375 PPC cannot 
be equated with the consensual consummation of marriage with a legally 
wedded girl, who has attained puberty, though she has not attained the 
minimum age provided under the Act of 1929. To do so would amount to 
declaring such marriage null and void. Regarding the validity of such 
marriage, it is worth noting that marriage is a significant institution in Islam 
and its validity or illegality can only be adjudged in the light of injunctions of 
Islam. The Act of 1929 only provides punishment for marrying a girl under 
16 years of age but does not declare such marriage void. When confronted 
with this proposition, learned counsel for the petitioner has controverted the 
validity of this enactment. I am not in agreement with his stance because to 
declare a law or provision of law against the injunctions of Islam is the sole 
domain of the Federal Shariat Court established under Article 203-C of the 
Constitution. Recently, in Farooq Omar Bhoja4 a challenge was thrown to 
the vires and legality of Sections 4, 5 & 6 of the Act of 1929 being repugnant 
to the injunctions of Islam for setting a minimum legal age for male and 
female to contract marriage. Although said enactment was held by the Federal 
Shariat Court to be within four corners of injunctions of Islam but Federal 
Shariat Court neither declared such marriage void nor made any kind of 
suggestions in this regard to amend the law. The intent of lawmakers is 
obvious from the bare reading of the Act of 1929 that they wanted to punish a 
person solemnizing marriage with a girl less than sixteen years of age. If the 
legislature intended to declare such marriage as void and to punish the 
offender under the general law, then there was no need to provide a 
punishment for such an act in the said enactment and there would have been a

simple mentioning that such an act would be punished under the general penal 
law of the land. Penal provisions cannot be attracted on the basis of analogy 
or presumptions in cases where there is a clear enactment available dealing 
with a specific situation. A similar enactment was promulgated by the 
Province of Sindh i.e. Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2013 and its 
Section 2(a), fixed the age of 18 years as the minimum legal age for both, 
male and female, to enter into marital ties. Said Act has also not declared 
such marriage as void although punishment for such offence has been 
enhanced.  
6. 
 
Furthermore, I could not lay my hand on any dictum laid down 
by the Federal Shariat Court where the marriage was declared void when a 
minor girl, without attaining the minimum age prescribed by the law, 
contracted marriage after attaining the age of puberty. Thus, in view of the 
above discussion, I have no hesitation to hold that the act of respondent No.5 
to marry Mst. Yasmeen and consummation of such marriage would not 
amount to rape as pleaded by learned counsel for the petitioner. 
7. 
 
Regarding the second moot point that Mst. Yasmeen was not 
competent to get her statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C., I have 
no hesitation to hold that such argument has no substance and highly 
misapprehended. The age of a witness has nothing to do with her/his 
competence to depose as a witness. Relevant law dealing with the 
competence of a witness has been provided under Article 3 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat (hereinafter ‘the Q.S.’). Before proceeding further, it will be 
advantageous to have a glimpse of relevant law, which has been reproduced 
herein below:- 
“3. Who may testify.– All persons shall be competent to testify unless the 
Court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions 
put to them, or from giving rational answers to those questions, by tender 
years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other 
cause of the same kind:  
Provided that a person shall not be competent to testify if he has been 
convicted by a Court for perjury or giving false evidence:  
Provided further that the provisions of the first proviso shall not apply to a 
person about whom the Court is satisfied that he has repented thereafter 
and mended his ways: 
 Provided further that the Court shall determine the competence of a 
witness in accordance with the qualifications prescribed by the injunctions 

6 
Writ Petition No.57371/2023 
 
of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah for a witness, and, 
where such witness is not forthcoming, the Court may take the evidence of 
a witness who may be available.  
Explanation.– A lunatic is not incompetent to testify unless he is prevented 
by his lunacy from understanding the questions put to him and giving 
rational answers to them.” 
This Article only provides a rule of circumspection. The law of evidence 
does not prescribe a specific age as a determinative factor to consider a 
witness to be competent to depose. Article 3 of Q.S. envisages that all the 
persons shall be competent to testify, unless the court considers that they are 
prevented from understanding the questions put to them or from giving 
rational answers to those questions, because of tender age, extreme old age, 
disease whether of mind, or any other cause of same kind. A child of tender 
age is competent to testify if he has intellectual capacity to understand 
questions and give rational answers thereto.  
8. 
 
Article 17 read with Article 3 of Q.S. vests in the court the 
discretion to determine whether a witness of tender age is or is not 
competent to be a witness by reason of understanding or lack of 
understanding. In Raja Khurram Ali Khan5, the Supreme Court elaborated 
that a court has to apply the ‘rationality test’ in such cases to ascertain 
whether a child is capable enough to understand the questions put to such 
child and to give rational answers. Relevant extract of the judgment has been 
provided below:- 
“45.  A close reading of the above provisions reveals that the essential 
conditions for a child, or for that matter any person, to appear and 
testify as a witness, is that the child or the person must have the 
capacity and intelligence of understanding the questions put to him, 
and also be able to rationally respond thereto. This threshold has been 
referred to as passing the "rationality test", and the practice that has 
developed with time in our jurisdiction is for the same to be carried out 
by the presiding Judge prior to recording the evidence of the child 
witness…” 
While applying rationally test, no specific set of questions is required to be 
put to a child witness and it is sole discretion of concerned court how it 
would satisfy itself regarding competence of a child witness. Presumption of 
correctness is attached to the judicial proceedings and declaration of 
Magistrate/court regarding its satisfaction would be enough to qualify such

witness as a competent witness. Guidance is sough from the decision of the 
Supreme Court in Ameer Umar6 wherein, while discussing the provisions of 
Section 118 of erstwhile Evidence Act 1872 (now Article 3 of the Q.S.), this 
principle was expounded in the following words:- 
“Section 118 of the Evidence Act does not prescribe any set of questions 
to be put in this behalf. All that is required is that the Court must satisfy 
itself that the child witness is capable of giving rational answers to the 
questions being put to him. The learned Magistrate has recorded his 
satisfaction on this point, and we do not see how we can go behind his 
opinion.” 
It is also pertinent to note that although in this case, learned Magistrate has 
recorded the questions and answers in writing, which were put to Mst. 
Yasmeen but even this was not the requirement of law. As discussed earlier, 
law only requires the satisfaction of the court before recording the statement 
of a child witness and no specific procedure has been provided by the law to 
be applied before reaching any conclusion regarding competence of a child 
witness. Jotting down the questions put to such child is not required as was 
held by this Court in Abdul Majeed7 in the following words:- 
 “16. …It means that the observing intellect of a child in the shape of 
writing question and answer is not the requirement of law. The Court was 
quite competent to give its observation with regard to the intellect of the 
witness. It would mean that only requirement is the satisfaction of the 
Court.” 
In this case, learned Magistrate put questions to Mst. Yasmeen to ascertain 
her competence to make statement and after his satisfaction, he recorded her 
statement. Thus, in the aforementioned facts and circumstances, I am of the 
considered view that Mst. Yasmeen was fully competent to make statement 
under Section 164 Cr.P.C., therefore, contention of learned counsel for the 
petitioner on this score is repelled.  
9. 
 
It would not be out of place to discuss that during investigation 
resort is being made to Section 164 of the Cr.P.C. by the Investigating 
Officer, generally when statement of a witness or confession of an accused is 
to be recorded before the Magistrate. The statement of the witness must be 
recorded like a statement recorded from a witness in court. Before recording 
the statement, an oath is administered. The procedure of recording the

Writ Petition No.57371/2023 
 
statement of a witness is entirely different from the procedure of recording 
the statement/confession of an accused. Only before and after recording a 
confession of an accused, various precautionary measures8 including giving 
of reflection time to the accused have been prescribed. This rigorous 
exercise needs not to be followed for recording the statement of a witness 
under Section 164 of the Cr.P.C. Section 364 of the Cr.P.C. is of general 
application as it only applies to the statement of an accused recorded during 
any proceeding. The confession of an accused is recorded under Section 164 
read with Section 364 of the Cr.P.C. Every court is bound to comply with all 
the precautionary measures provided under Section 364 Cr.P.C. whenever 
statement of an accused is recorded. But in the case of recording the 
statement of a witness, Section 364 Cr.P.C. has no relevance.  
10. 
 I have strangely noticed that learned Magistrate allowed the counsel 
for the petitioner to cross examine Mst. Yasmeen after her statement was 
recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. and also provided a memorandum at the 
end, which is required to be given after recording the confessional statement 
of an accused to the effect that he was warned that he was not bound to 
make the confessional statement, etc. As far as allowing the petitioner to 
cross examine Mst. Yasmeen is concerned, law does not warrant any such 
concession because petitioner was not an accused in the case. Under sub-
section (1-A) of Section 164 Cr.P.C., the opportunity of cross examination is 
provided to the accused only. Initially this opportunity was also not available 
to the accused but later sub-section (1-A) was added to Section 164 Cr.P.C. 
through Section 62 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972. As a ready 
reference, relevant sub-section of Section 164 Cr.P.C. has been provided 
below:- 
“Section 164. Power to record statements and confessions: (1) Any 
Magistrate of the first class and any Magistrate of the second class 
specially empowered in this behalf by the Provincial Government may, if 
he is not a police-officer, record any statement or confession made to him 
in the course of an investigation under this Chapter or at any time 
afterwards before the commencement of the inquiry or trial. 
(1-A) Any such statement may be recorded by such Magistrate in the 
presence of the accused, and the accused given an opportunity of cross-
examining the witness making the statement. (emphasis supplied)  
(2)…. 
(3)….” 
                                                          
8 As provided under SS. 164 & 364 of the Cr.P.C.  

9 
Writ Petition No.57371/2023 
 
Above provision of law is self-explanatory and only provides an opportunity 
of cross examining a witness, who is getting her/his statement recorded 
under Section 164 Cr.P.C., to the accused against whom such statement was 
made. Right to cross examine a witness during trial proceedings is provided 
under Article 132(2) of the Q.S. but sub-section (1-A) of Section 164 
Cr.P.C. is a special provision enacted to provide an opportunity to the 
accused only to confront the witness who makes the statement against such 
accused before a Magistrate prior to the commencement of trial. Allowing 
the petitioner to cross examine Mst. Yasmeen would mean that Magistrate 
had considered and declared Mst. Yasmeen as ‘a hostile witness’ and 
allowed the petitioner to put questions to her under Article 150 of the Q.S. 
which was based upon wrong assumption of law because these were not the 
trial proceedings during the course of which a witness could be declared 
hostile and party producing such witness could be allowed to put questions 
to such a witness. Thus, act of learned Magistrate to allow petitioner to cross 
examine the alleged victim Mst. Yasmeen was not warranted by the law.  
11. 
 
As far as question of providing the memorandum by the 
Magistrate at the end of statement of Mst. Yasmeen to the effect that she was 
not bound by law to record the statement is concerned, I am afraid that it is 
not the requirement of law. Section 164(3) Cr.P.C. only requires such 
memorandum to be provided at the end of the confessional statement of an 
accused. Sub-section (3) requires that before recording confessional 
statement of an accused, a Magistrate should convey to the accused that 
she/he is not bound to make a confession and if she/he does so it may be 
used as evidence against her/him. It further requires that Magistrate shall put 
a memorandum to that effect at the foot of such confessional statement. Sub-
section (3) of Section 164 Cr.P.C. has been provided herein below for ready 
reference:- 
“Section 164. Power to record statements and confessions: (1)--- 
(2) --- 
(3) A Magistrate shall, before recording any such confession explain to 
the person making it that he is not bound to make a confession and that if 
he does so it may be used as evidence against him and no Magistrate shall 
record any such confession unless, upon questioning the person making it, 
he has reason to believe that it was made voluntarily; and, when he 

10 
Writ Petition No.57371/2023 
 
records any confession, he shall make a memorandum at the foot of such 
record to the following effect:--  
"I have explained to (name) that he is not bound to make a confession and 
that, if he does so, any confession he may make may be used as evidence 
against him and I believe that this confession was voluntarily made. It was 
taken in my presence and hearing, and was read over to the person 
making it and admitted by him to be correct, and it contains a full and true 
account of the statement made by him.” 
(Signed) A.B. Magistrate. 
Above referred provision of law makes it profusely clear that such 
memorandum is to be recorded only at the end of a confessional statement of 
an accused and there is no legal requirement to provide such memorandum 
at the end of the statement of a witness recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C.  
12. 
 
In the view of above discussion, I have no hesitation to hold 
that the practice of allowing the persons other than the accused, to cross 
examine a witness after her/his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. is 
recorded, and providing a memorandum as envisaged under Section 164(3) 
of the Cr.P.C. at the end of statement of a witness, is not in accordance with 
the law.  
13. 
The upshot of the above discussion is that this petition is dismissed 
being devoid of any merits.
