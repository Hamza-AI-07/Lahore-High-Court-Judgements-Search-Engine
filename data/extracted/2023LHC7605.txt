ASIM HAFEEZ J. Petitioner, through instant constitutional petition, 
challenges the order of 19.09.2018, by Respondent No.2 [Commissioner (IR)] and 
order of dismissal of petitioner’s appeal dated 03.10.2022, by respondent No.1 
[Chief Commissioner (IR) LTU], which affirmed order of respondent No.2, 
whereby approval extended to the petitioner as Non-Profit-Organization (NPO), 
was withdrawn in exercise of powers under Rule 217 of the Income Tax Rules 
2002 (Rules, 2002). It is pertinent to mention that respondent No.1 decided appeal, 
preferred by the petitioner, pursuant to the orders of this Court of 24.11.2021, 
whereby while allowing constitutional petition bearing W.P No.26250 of 2020 
direction was given to respondent No.1 to decide appeal on merits, instead of 

W.P. No.79632/2022

remanding it to respondent No.2. Earlier respondent No.1 had remanded the matter 
to respondent No.2 through order of 24.04.2020.  
2. 
Controversy circumambulates determination of alleged entitlement of the 
petitioner, claiming NPO status, apparently withdrawn in terms of the decisions 
assailed. Various reasons were cited for withdrawal, primary being the key 
allegation that assets of petitioner entity were employed in a manner to confer 
private benefit / personal gain to another person, focusing a loan transaction of July 
2008, whereby loan amounting to Rs.180.500 Million was extended by the 
petitioner to its associated concern, i.e., Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited, offered on 
uncompetitive and concessional rate of mark-up – different from what has been 
offered to customers otherwise. This dolling of benefit was categorized as 
transaction, inverse of an arm’s length transaction. Petitioner has approached this 
court, invoking constitutional jurisdiction, seeking declaration of invalidity against 
the decisions on the premise that provisions of law, relevant for the purposes of 
present purposes, were not interpreted lawfully and, additionally that allegation of 
private benefit conferred was unsubstantiated.    
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that NPO status was withdrawn on 
erroneous assumptions, allegedly declaring that private benefit was bagged by an 
individual, but no specific instance was indicated, showing doling out of alleged 
benefit. Adds that no direct evidence of alleged benefit was established. Argues 
that nature, objective and context of transaction under reference was misconstrued. 
Further submits that Petitioner entity, at relevant time, was functioning in terms of 
section 42 of the erstwhile Companies Ordinance, 1984, as guarantee / non-profit 
company, enjoying privileges and abiding by the limitations prescribed in law. It is 
explained that loan of Rs.18.500 Million was granted to Kashf Holdings (Pvt)

Limited to facilitate investment in Kashf Microfinance Bank, and intended 
objective was achieved whereby much needed funds were channeled for meeting 
the Minimum Capital Requirements by Kashf Microfinance Bank, and in return 
petitioner acquired substantial influence over the affairs of Kashf Microfinance 
Bank (Now operational as FINCA) – wherein, at material times, the petitioner and 
Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited jointly held over 51% of shares. Adds that direct 
investment by petitioner in Kashf Microfinance Bank could have had not provided 
such firm corporate footing that was achieved through the debtor entity - Kashf 
Holdings (Pvt) Limited. Learned counsel argues that no dubiousness was 
established qua the transaction, which otherwise fulfills all legal and regulatory 
requirements. Adds that allegation of extending benefit by offering loan at 
subsidized rate of return / Mark-up – is misconceived, who drew parallel to a 
transaction, where loan was extended to Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited by another 
entity – Acumen – on similar terms, as agreed between the petitioner and Kashf 
Holdings (Pvt) Limited. Further submits that transaction undertaken was not in 
breach of any objective defined in Memorandum of Association of petitioner, one 
of which objective was to the expand microfinancing base to uplift financial status 
of the distressed segment of the society. Adds that no violation of Rule 217 of the 
Rules, 2002 was committed, and questions that how a transaction could be branded 
as failing to meet test of an arm’s length transaction, when no irregularity was 
identified, and nor any complaint was registered with or by the Regulator or the 
State Bank of Pakistan. Adds that petitioner is entitled for grant of approval and 
privileges extended in law, when requisite conditions, prescribed in law, under 
sections 2(36), 2(11A), 108, and clause 75 of Part-1 of Second Schedule to the 
Ordinance, 2001, are fully met. Lastly emphasized that order impugned was passed 
without application of mind and same is devoid of any plausible reasoning. 

W.P. No.79632/2022

4. 
Conversely, learned counsels appearing for the respondents submit that 
transaction of loan was designed to extend personal benefit to another person, 
having had meaningful representation in the petitioner entity and who, 
contemporaneously, held 99% shares of Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited – that is 
799,900 shares out of 800,000 issued shares. Learned counsels referred to various 
clauses of the Shareholder’s Agreement to unveil beneficial terms. Adds that no 
plausible justification was extended that why loan, at concessionary rate, was 
extended to Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited when said amount could be offered on 
better rate of return. Explains that justification offered to allege benefits of routing 
funds to Kashf Microfinance Bank, through Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited, is an 
attempt to camouflage private benefits extended. 
5. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that purpose of routing 
funds through Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited was to have had majority 
shareholding of Kashf Microfinance Bank and accumulative shareholding of 
petitioner and Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited was over 51%, which makes Kashf 
Holdings (Pvt) Limited, a holding company of Kashf Microfinance Bank. Learned 
counsel provided shareholding pattern of Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited and Kashf 
Microfinance Bank, along with copies of Form-A. Case advocated, in brief, was 
that petitioner is entitled to grant / issuance of NPO status, when requirements of 
law were met, and no specific details were provided or indicated in the impugned 
order to substantiate that loan transaction fails to meet test of an arm’s length 
transaction. Petitioner has also placed on record copies of orders of amended 
assessments carried out under section 122(5A) of the Ordinance, 2001, for the Tax 
years 2019, 2020, and 2021, to apprise that in due course assessments were 
amended and benefit of NPO status was not extended.

Heard. Available record perused.  
7. 
The scope, context and reach of instant proceedings is to examine if any 
illegality was committed by respondents No.1 and 2, while withdrawing approval 
under Rule 217 of the Rules, 2002, and while doing so to unravel the transaction 
for the purposes of ascertaining due compliance of requisite requirements for 
claiming NPO status. Notably claim of advantages accrued or benefits realized by 
the petitioner, if any, as consequence of commercial transactions with   Kashf 
Holdings (Pvt) Limited was not the subject matter or scope of instant proceedings, 
except to the extent that whether said transactions were source of conferring 
private benefit to another person in the context of scope of section 2(36) of the 
Ordinance, 2001.  
8. 
There is no cavil that petitioner functioned under section 42 of the erstwhile 
Companies Ordinance, 1984, and carried charitable and not for profits activities 
still, in the context of provisions of Ordinance, 2001, petitioner was essentially 
obligated to fulfil conditionalities and requirements prescribed under section 2(36) 
of the Ordinance, 2001 and those prescribed under Chapter XVII of the Rules 
2002. Simplicitor the protection and privileges available under section 42 of 
erstwhile Companies Ordinance 1984 would not entitle the petitioner to per se 
claim NPO status under the Ordinance, 2001. It is expedient to reproduce section 
2(36) of the Ordinance, 2001 and relevant sub-clauses of Rule 217 and Rule 213 
(2)(a) of the Rules, 2002, which read as, 
“Section 2 (36) “non-profit organization” means any person other than an 
individual, which is —  
(a) established for religious, educational, charitable, welfare purposes for 
general public], or for the promotion of an amateur sport;  
(b)  formed and registered by or under any law as a non-profit organization;

and none of the assets of such person confers, or may confer, a private 
benefit to any other person;” 
 
 
Rule 217. Power to withdraw approval - (1) The Commissioner may, at any time,

and objects of the organization do(es) not provide for prohibiting the 
making of any changes in the constitution, memorandum and articles of 
association, trust deed, rules, regulations and bye-laws without prior 
approval of the Commissioner;  
 
(b) the organization has-  
 
(i) been or is being used for personal gain of any particular person or a 
group of persons as specified in clause (a) of sub-rule (2) of rule 213

Rule 213(2). The Commissioner may refuse to approve the organization if the 
Commissioner is satisfied that the organization – 
 
(a) has been or is being used for personal gain of any particular person 
or a group of persons;       
[Emphasis supplied] 
9. 
Controversy engrossed calls for determining the scope and reach of 
limitation prescribed in terms of section 2(36) of the Ordinance, 2001 in the 
context that whether assets of the petitioner became source of conferring any 
private benefit unto Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited or shareholders thereof, either 
realized on the spot or realizable at any given point of time. Petitioner had enjoyed 
NPO status but later withdrawn, on allegation of failing to meet requisite 
conditions. Rule 217 of Rules, 2002 extends powers to the Commissioner to refuse 
approval if satisfied that organization has or is being used for personal gains of any 
particular person or a group of persons. Petitioner is a non-profit entity. And Kashf 
Holdings (Pvt) Limited is a for-profit entity, solely working for the interests of the 
shareholders. Textual reading of section 2(36) of the Ordinance does not suggest 

W.P. No.79632/2022  
 
-:7:- 
 
immediately realizable benefit but also includes deferred benefits, realized in due 
course. The expression ‘may confer’ needs sharper focus. There is another aspect 
of the matter. Relevant provision of law does not quantify any limit or threshold of 
the benefit, which, for the purposes of section 2(36) of the Ordinance, 2001, simply 
has to be a benefit attributable and accruing out of assets of not-for-profit entity.  
10. 
For determining the scope and limits of sections 2(36) of the Ordinance, 
2001 and Rule 217(1)(b) of the Rules, 2002, primarily two transactions, closely 
connected and contextually connected with the underlying controversy, need 
unraveling. First relates to the transaction of acquisition of shares of Kashf 
Holdings (Pvt) Limited and second, concerning transaction of loan of Rs.180.500 
Million. Other than the context of this case, there is no cavil that raising of share 
capital, through issuance of new shares, of a company was a permissible 
commercial mechanism. And in the context of this case the capital raised, through 
issuance of new shares of Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited, was statedly channeled to 
ensure economic sustenance of Kashf Microfinance Bank – meeting condition of 
minimum capital requirement. Various persons and entities have acquired new 
shares, upon execution of Shareholder’s Agreement, against the consideration paid, 
and as far as those incoming members are concerned there is no issue, except one 
of the contributories thereof, i.e., the petitioner [claimed to be a not-for-profit 
entity]. It is evident from perusal of terms of Shareholder’s Agreement of 
31.07.2008 that 2,051,283 new shares of Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited were issued 
against consideration of Rs.152,600,070/-. Out of which Rs.63,000,000/- was paid 
by the petitioner for acquisition of 900,000 shares of Kashf Holdings (Pvt) 
Limited, whereby the transactional value of each share was fixed at Rs.70 - 
evidencing premium of Rs.60 against each share of Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited 

W.P. No.79632/2022  
 
-:8:- 
 
when the face value of each share was Rs.10. An increase of 7 times the value of 
shares. It manifests a capital gain for Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited, inter alia 
raising capital interest of the shareholders. It is reiterated that incidence of gain 
need not be realized on the spot but gain otherwise deferred to a realizable event in 
future, is still a benefit-cum-gain. This demonstrates a seed sown and fruit to be 
reaped, scenario. 
11. 
Fundamental question is whether acquisition of shares of Kashf Holdings 
(Pvt) Limited was beneficial for the petitioner or does the transaction tantamount to 
conferring private benefit unto Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited, and realizable by its 
shareholders – expression any other person in section 2(36) of the Ordinance, 
2001, inter alia suggests reference to a natural person or a company as the case 
may be [Person is defined in section 80 of the Ordinance, 2001]. Before threadbare 
discussion qua the effect of transaction of acquisition of shares of Kashf Holdings 
(Pvt) Limited, it is appropriate to give details of another transaction, made basis for 
refusal to accord NPO status.  
  
Petitioner, in July 2008, extended loan of Rs.180.500 Million to Kashf 
Holdings (Pvt) Limited, on reduced mark-up – Marked-up price was 
Rs.357,687,440. Loan was for the term of 10 years and repayment were to start 
from September 2013 to May 2018. Notably, loan was restructured in the year 
2013 and repayment timelines were changed. There is no denial that petitioner 
encountered impairment loss of Rs.56.99 Million, as a consequence of repeated 
restructurings. During arguments, when questioned, it was informed that loan was 
again restructured in 2019 and still payable. It is evident from record that approval 
for grant of loan to Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited and decision to acquire shares of 
Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited, was taken in Extraordinary General Meeting of the 

W.P. No.79632/2022  
 
-:9:- 
 
petitioner, carried out on 26.04.2008 – at which point in time Ms. Roshaneh Zafar 
was shown as Chief Executive, Director and Member of the Petitioner, though she 
recused herself from participation in the meeting but still her father and brother 
attended the meeting and voted in favour of the decision to extend loan to and 
acquire shares of Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited. It is not disputed that at that point 
in time, Ms. Roshaneh Zafar held 99% of shareholding in Kashf Holdings (Pvt) 
Limited – having 799,900 shares out of total issued shares of 800,000/- and 100 
shares were held in the name of Mr. Amir Rasul – as consequence of Shareholder’s 
Agreement, percentage of shares of Ms. Roshaneh Zafar was 26.8%.  
12. 
Undilutedly, inflow of liquidity in Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited, partly by 
way of loan transaction on subsidized rate of return and partly through spending of 
Rs.63.000 Million for acquisition of shares of an associated undertaking, has had 
improved the financial position of Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited – acquisition of 
shares by other incoming shareholders, other than the petitioner, is not the domain 
of present proceedings. And, evidently, this uplifting of economic outlook of Kashf 
Holdings (Pvt) Limited was practically demonstrated, when shares at Rs.70 were 
offered to the incoming members – though having face value of Rs.10. Kashf 
Holdings (Pvt) Limited is a private limited entity and not a listed company, 
therefore market forces will not determine the price of the shares. This phenomenal 
raise in share price was not explained - nothing is disclosed that what were those 
peculiar factors that contributed towards 7 times increase in the share price. This 
per se indicated huge gains in terms of capital and interests of the shareholders, 
which gain, when coupled with the facility of loan at concessional rate and 
repeatedly done restructuring, offered a double treat.  

W.P. No.79632/2022  
 
-:10:- 
 
13. 
Now let’s deal with the converse argument pleaded to undermine the evident 
benefits / gains. Petitioner banked on the shareholding pattern of Kashf 
Microfinance Bank, who claimed that jointly the petitioner and Kashf Holdings 
(Pvt) Limited held over 51% of shares of Kashf Microfinance Bank, which extends 
conspicuous benefits to the petitioner, in terms of having controlling influence in 
Kashf Microfinance Bank. It is evident that this stand was consistently iterated by 
the petitioner before the authorities, claiming that transactions suspected had in fact 
offered petitioner’s management control of Kashf Microfinance Bank, in wake of 
petitioner’s holding of 30.2% shareholding of Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited 
coupled with 26.8% of shares of Ms. Roshaneh Zafar. This mantra of having 
corporate control, allegedly by dint of routing funds for acquisition of shares of 
Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited, instead of acquiring shares of Kashf Microfinance 
Bank, fell flat when, lately, the shareholding of Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited in 
Kashf Microfinance Bank was reduced from 51%, to 8.08%. Hence, the argument 
proves to be a self-inflicted injury. This off-loading of shares does constitute a 
benefit realizable event. There is no claim that shares sold were priced below 
Rs.10. 
14. 
Grant of loan to Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited, a private and for-profit entity 
per se is a tangible benefit, bagged by the debtor entity. Learned counsel 
strenuously argued on the purpose of the loan and petitioner’s perceived control 
over the management / affairs of Kashf Microfinance Bank but failed to appreciate 
innate economic benefit offered through finance at concessional mark-up and 
effect of often restructurings. 
 
 
15. 
Despite sheltering commercial arrangements, under various tiers, reality 
cannot be camouflaged, and undeniably the financial position of Kashf Holdings 

W.P. No.79632/2022  
 
-:11:- 
 
(Pvt) Limited firmed up as consequence of subject matter transactions, which 
resulted in benefits to Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited and the shareholders, 
conspicuous thereof being Ms. Roshaneh Zafar, who held 26.8% shares in Kashf 
Holdings (Pvt) Limited and other meaningful influence on the petitioner, at all 
material times. What is important is the relationship of the shareholders with a for-
profit entity - Kashf Holdings (Pvt.) Limited – and the context of assets of the 
petitioner. For all intent and purposes benefit accrued to an associated entity is a 
benefit attributable to the shareholders. The fundamental question is not 
ascertainment of legality or otherwise of the transactions or probing their success 
in commercial terms or searching for proportionate advantage for the petitioner – a 
claimed non-profit company - but the factum of apparent private benefit conferred 
or intended to be conferred, notwithstanding the time of realization thereof. It is 
pertinent to mention that, in simple terms, restructuring of loan is source of 
continuing benefit / gain for Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited. Effect of impairment of 
loss can be downplayed for the purposes of apportionment but factum of 
diminishing value of assets of the petitioner cannot be denied – which situation 
inversely enabled the associated entity to realize benefits at the expense of non-
profit entity.  
  
Petitioner submitted written submissions, after the conclusion of the hearing, 
when case was kept for orders. Written submissions are examined and 
improvements in the oral submissions are notable, nonetheless, those submissions 
are considered, along with the case-law cited therein and found not persuasive 
enough to extend benefit of compliance of requisite requirements under the 
relevant provisions of law, referred hereinabove. Petitioner emphasized that 
transaction of loan was intended to pursue, well-defined, welfare purpose, that is 
establishment of Microfinance Bank and in achieving such an objective, if any 

W.P. No.79632/2022  
 
-:12:- 
 
incidental or ancillary benefit is, unintentionally extended to any person, it will not 
change the character of the petitioner, being a NPO entity. Following cases, from 
our and foreign jurisdiction, were referred to support contentions, reported as  
Jaipur Charitable Trust V. Commissioner of Income-Tax (1981 127 ITR 620 
Delhi),  Hamdard Laboratories India And….V. Assistant Director of Income Tax, 
Commissioner of Income-Tax V. Andhra Chamber of Commerce (1965 AIR 1281), 
Commissioner of Taxation V. Word Investments Limited (2007 FCAFC 71; 164 
FCR 194), Congregational Union of NSW V. Thistlethwayte [(1952) 87 CLR 375] 
and Stratton V. Simpson [(1970) 125 CLR 138].  Justifications, for off-loading of 
shares in Microfinance Bank, were iterated. Effect of impairment loss was 
explained as inconsequential incident. It is emphasized that decision of transfer of 
customer’s portfolio to Kashf Microfinance Bank [Now FINCA] was solely a 
welfare orientated action, primarily driven by the financial constraints and 
circumstances. Reliance is placed on following case-law, Treat Corporation Ltd. 
V. ELMAC Ltd. (2011 YLR 2825), Ahmad Khan Bhatti V. Masooda Fatimia (PLD 
1981 Kar. 398), Pak Arab Fertilizers V. Dawood Herculis (PLD 2015 Sindh 142) 
and Shariq ul Haq and others V. PIA [2018 PLC (C.S) 975]. 
 
  
It is reiterated, at the expense of taxing the judgement, that section 2(36) of 
the Ordinance, 2001 and Rule 217(1)(b) of the Rules, 2002 are misconstrued, and 
effect thereof, in context of the facts of the case, was underappreciated. Court is in 
fact invited to invoke the principle of ‘CASUS OMISSUS’ and to add or read in the 
provisions of law, without appreciating the age-old principle of interpreting tax 
statutes that ‘there is no room for intendment’. Petitioner claimed certain 
exemptions, privileges attached to and otherwise available to organizations, 
qualified for NPO status, without appreciating that the conditions, effect of limiting 

W.P. No.79632/2022  
 
-:13:- 
 
such exemptions and privileges to any NPO regime, require strict application and 
enforcement. Petitioner is unworthy and not entitled of availing such exemptions 
or privileges, in the wake of the transactions transacted, having the effect of 
conferring private benefit, attributable and realized, between two points in time. 
Despite all the commercial prudence applied to justify the transactions, the reality 
of conferring private benefits could neither be effaced nor belittled, while 
appreciating the effect of underpriced loan, injection of equity by the petitioner, 
upon purchase of shares of Kashf Holdings (Pvt) Limited, at premium price – 
seven times the face value of shares. And then was the decision of off-loading of 
shares of Microfinance Bank, which not only discredited the arguments made 
before this Court – whereby it was projected that transactions in question were 
intended to secure a firm corporate footing for the petitioner in Microfinance Bank 
–, but, evidently, manifested reaping of private benefit(s) – which decision was the 
last straw that broke the camel’s back. Judgments referred are distinguishable on 
facts and effect thereof have no bearing qua peculiar features of this case. 
16. 
Learned counsels for petitioner have not disputed the transactions but 
focused on purported benefit, accrued or accruable to the petitioner, without 
appreciating that commercial success of the transactions is not the bone of 
contention, but real issue is whether assets of the petitioner were employed in a 
fashion to confer priv ate benefit or not. The argument attributing commercial 
success to the transactions is in fact acknowledgment of collateral benefit to 
another person by virtue of exclusive utilization of the assets of the petitioner and 
allegations become more sinister when the beneficiary is an associated entity – the 
end does not justify the means. Learned counsels emphasized on the effectiveness 
and broad sweep of the microfinance banking. There is no denial of advantages of 

W.P. No.79632/2022  
 
-:14:- 
 
Grameen Bank Model – [aka – Microfinance Banking] – provided in garb thereof 
no private benefit or economic gain is extended. 
17. 
In aforesaid circumstances, mischief intended to be remedied through the 
limitations prescribed under section 2(36) of the Ordinance, 2001 and Rule 
217(1)(b) of Rules, 2002 is traced and correctly targeted.  
18. 
Hence, no illegality or apparent errors are found in the orders impugned and 
no jurisdictional defect manifests in exercise of powers available under Rule 
217(1)(b) of the Rules, 2002. Instant constitutional petition is meritless and same 
is, hereby, dismissed, with no order as to the costs.
