ALI ZIA BAJWA, J.:- Through this Habeas Petition 
filed under Section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
(hereinafter ‘the Code’), the petitioner seeks the recovery of his son, 
namely Rashid Hassan Butt (‘the Detenu’). In pursuance of the order of 
this Court, the Detenu was produced before the Court by Respondent 
No. 2, Afzal Sub-Inspector of Anti Vehicle Lifting Squad (‘AVLS’) 
Mustafa Town Police Station, Lahore.  It has been stated by 
Respondent No.2 that the Detenu was arrested in connection with Case 
FIR No. 2219/23 initially registered under Section 381-A of Pakistan 
Penal Code, 1860 (‘PPC’) with Shera Kot Police Station, Lahore. 
 
2. 
Earlier the Detenu applied for his ad-interim pre-arrest bail 
in the afore-referred criminal case, which was confirmed by the Court 
of Sessions vide consolidated order dated 21.09.2023. That order 

Crl. Misc. No. 10162-H/2024 
 
(2) 
remained unchallenged, hence, the same attained finality. Thereafter the 
investigating officer i.e. Respondent No.2 added offences under 
Sections 420, 468 and 471, PPC in the case and arrested the Detenu. 
The short but crucial question of law involved in this case is whether an 
accused person, who has been granted bail in a criminal case by the 
Court of competent jurisdiction, can be arrested in the same case under 
the garb of the addition of new offences.  
 
3. 
Arguments of parties heard and record perused.  
 
4. 
In the evolving landscape of criminal jurisprudence, a 
pivotal issue emerges when additional charges are levied against an 
accused who has already secured bail for the initial charge(s). This 
scenario presents a complex interplay between the rights of the accused 
and the interests of justice, necessitating a judicious approach to bail 
proceedings. Traditionally, the addition of new charges against a bailed-
out accused has prompted a debate on the procedural steps that should 
follow. On one hand, there exists a perspective that mandates the 
accused to seek bail afresh for the newly added offences, treating them 
as separate grounds for judicial scrutiny. This view emphasizes the 
autonomous nature of each offence and its distinct implications for the 
accused’s liberty. However, a more nuanced approach considers the 
procedural economy and the overarching principles of fairness and 
justice that when additional offences are added to an accused’s charges, 
though it is imperative to re-evaluate the grounds upon which bail was 
initially granted but, this reconsideration does not necessitate a 
redundant plea for bail by the accused rather, shifts the onus onto the 
prosecution to seek the cancellation of the existing bail. Under this 
approach, the prosecution bears the responsibility to demonstrate that 
the addition of new charges substantively alters the landscape of risk 
and considerations that underpinned the original bail decision.  
 

Crl. Misc. No. 10162-H/2024

5. 
 
For the proposition in hand, it will be advantageous to 
consider the relevant Rule i.e. Rule 26.21(6) of The Punjab Police 
Rules, 1934 (hereinafter ‘The Rules’) which has been reproduced 
below: -  
“26.21. Bail and recognizance. –  
. 
. 
. 
(6) No police officer has power to re-arrest an accused person who has 
been released on bail under section 497, Code of Criminal Procedure. 
When re-arrest is deemed necessary, the police shall apply to a 
competent court for the cancellation of the bail bond and the issue of a 
warrant in accordance with the provisions of Section 497(5) Code of 
Criminal Procedure.” 
 
The Rules, particularly those outlined in Volume-III, stipulate clear 
procedure for the conduct of police officers during the investigation 
and process to be opted for the arrest of the accused. The above-
provided Rule explicitly requires that in cases where an accused has 
already been released on bail for certain charges, any intention to 
arrest the accused for additional charges must be accompanied by an 
application for the cancellation of bail, presented before the competent 
court as envisaged under Section 497(5) of the Code, which shall be 
decided after issuance of notice to the accused. Reliance can be placed 
on the ratio rendered in Waqar Ahmed1 wherein while considering a 
situation where subsequently some offence(s) were added by the 
investigating agency it was ruled by the Division Bench as infra: -  
 
“However it would not be justified to commit him to custody 
straightaway but what the law of propriety would demand is that 
such person be not deprived of his liberty without providing him 
an opportunity of hearing by serving him with such show cause 
notice by the court.” 
In Pradeep Ram2 Supreme Court of India while considering a legal 
proposition that whether in a case where an accused has been bailed out

2 Pradeep Ram vs. The State Of Jharkhand – AIR 2019 SC 3193  

Crl. Misc. No. 10162-H/2024 
 
(4) 
in a criminal case, in which case, subsequently new offences are added, 
is it necessary that bail earlier granted should be canceled for taking the 
accused in custody, after an exhaustive deliberation ruled as under: -  
“In a case where an accused has already been granted bail, the 
investigating authority on addition of an offence or offences may 
not proceed to arrest the accused, but for arresting the accused 
on such addition of offence or offences it need to obtain an order 
to arrest the accused from the Court which had granted the bail.” 
 
The legal position that emerges from the above discussion is that once 
an accused person has been granted bail, he cannot be arrested by the 
investigating agency without seeking cancellation of bail granted by the 
court of competent jurisdiction by way of filing an application under 
Section 497(5) of the Code. Rule 26.21(6) of the Rules mandates that 
any such action must be taken with explicit permission of the Court, 
ensuring judicial oversight, and safeguarding the rights of the accused. 
 
6. 
Allowing the police to arrest an accused who has already 
been granted bail by merely adding new offences to the case, without 
first seeking the cancellation of the existing bail, would effectively 
grant law enforcement agencies the unrestricted authority to circumvent 
judicial orders. This practice, if left unchecked, portends a perilous shift 
towards a regime where the liberties of individuals are held in abeyance 
by the caprices of prosecutorial discretion. The jurisprudence 
surrounding bail is predicated on the presumption of innocence, a 
cornerstone of criminal law, and serves as a bulwark against the 
potential for arbitrary detention. To permit law enforcement agencies to 
nullify this judicial safeguard by the mere expedient of adding charges 
post hoc is to erode the foundations of our legal system. Such a course 
of action not only flouts the explicit mandates of the law but also 
infringes upon the accused’s fundamental right to liberty, as enshrined 
in the Constitution.  
 

Crl. Misc. No. 10162-H/2024 
 
(5) 
7. 
Moreover, this approach opens Pandora box of legal 
uncertainties, where the grant of bail could be rendered nugatory by the 
subsequent prosecutorial maneuvers. It establishes a precedent that 
could lead to rampant abuse of power, allowing for the detention of 
individuals ad infinitum, by the simple device of adding new offences 
against them. The prospect of such unbridled discretion vested in the 
investigating agency is antithetical to the rule of law and the principles 
of justice and equity. This practice would not only undermine the 
sanctity and finality of judicial decisions but also endanger the 
foundational principles of our legal system that aim to protect 
individual liberties against arbitrary detention. Such an approach would 
give law enforcement agencies a de facto license to frustrate judicial 
orders, enabling them to detain any bailed-out accused at will by the 
simple expedient of adding new charges.  
 
8. 
Therefore, it is incumbent upon this Court to staunchly 
oppose such practices that imperil the liberty of the citizenry and detract 
from the integrity of the judicial process. The arrest of an individual 
granted bail by a Court of competent jurisdiction, without first seeking 
the cancellation of said bail on legitimate grounds, is an affront to the 
procedural safeguards designed to protect against the misuse of state 
power. The addition of offences after the grant of bail cannot serve as a 
carte blanche for investigating agencies to circumvent the due process 
rights of the accused. This would lead to a dangerous precedent, 
eroding trust in the judicial process and the principle of fairness that 
underpins our legal system, ultimately rendering the concept of bail 
meaningless and jeopardizing the rights of the accused to fair and 
impartial treatment under the law. The approach advocating for the 
prosecution’s initiation of bail cancellation proceedings upon the 
addition of new offences offers a balanced mechanism for reassessing 
an accused’s eligibility for bail. By placing the evidentiary burden on 
the prosecution to justify bail revocation and concurrently allowing the 

Crl. Misc. No. 10162-H/2024 
 
(6) 
accused an opportunity to defend their continued entitlement to bail, the 
legal framework honors both the dynamics of criminal litigation and the 
fundamental rights of individuals. Thus, this Court holds that even if 
during the interrogation new offences are added or during the trial, 
additional offences are added in the charge framed against a bailed-out 
accused, the prosecution has to seek cancellation of his bail before 
arresting such accused against these newly added offences. This 
approach will not only reaffirm the supremacy of the judiciary in 
matters of bail but will also serve as a necessary check on the potential 
for police overreach, ensuring that the scales of justice remain evenly 
balanced. 
 
9. 
The contention of the learned Law Officer is that Rule 
26.21 (6) of the Rules only deals with the cases where the accused is 
released on post-arrest bail under Section 497 of the Code and not with 
the cases where the accused is admitted to pre-arrest. I am afraid the 
objection raised by the learned Law Officer is highly misconceived, 
stemming from a bare and superficial reading of the Rule ibid without 
grasping its underlying essence and purpose. The argument overlooks 
the fundamental principles of justice and liberty that the Rule seeks to 
protect, failing to appreciate its broader applicability in safeguarding 
the rights of individuals against arbitrary arrest. It is essential to 
consider beyond the mere text and understand the Rule in the context of 
its intent to uphold the sanctity of judicial decisions granting bail, 
ensuring that such decisions are not circumvented without proper legal 
process. To address the challenge of applying the principle that an 
accused, once released on bail, cannot be re-arrested without first 
seeking the cancellation of that bail to cases of pre-arrest bail, it is 
essential to understand both the historical context and the underlying 
rationale of the law.  
 

Crl. Misc. No. 10162-H/2024

10. 
The protection provided in Rule 26.21(6) of the Rules, was 
crafted in a legal environment where only post-arrest bail was 
recognized. The Constitutional Courts have always been actively 
engaged in filling legislative gaps and ensuring that the law evolves in 
response to emerging challenges. It was perhaps for the first time in 
December 1948 that by interpreting the latter part of Section 498 of the 
Code in Hidayat Ullah Khan’s Case (PLD 1949 Lah. 21 =AIR 1949 
Lah. 77), the power vesting in the High Courts and the Courts of 
Sessions to admit persons to bail before they could be arrested, was 
authoritatively discovered by a Full Bench of the Lahore High Court.3 
The evolution of the law of pre-arrest bail as a judge-made law post-
partition starting from the Hidayat Ullah Khan supra, reflects the legal 
system’s adaptability and its commitment to protect the individual’s 
rights and liberties. This landmark judgment laid the foundation for the 
legal construct of pre-arrest bail in our country, which has since 
evolved through the diligent scrutiny and thoughtful adjudications of 
our Constitutional Courts. The Jurisprudence on pre-arrest bail evolved 
through a series of judgments by the Superior Courts of Pakistan.4 
These judgments have not only interpreted but also expanded the 
contours of the law of pre-arrest bail, adapting it to the changing 
dynamics of criminal law and societal needs.  
 
11. 
 
In arguing for the application of the principle expounded 
in Rule 26.21(6) of the Rules to cases of pre-arrest bail, one must lean 
on the foundational tenets of justice, liberty, and the Rule of law. The 
essence is to protect the liberty of an accused who has been deemed 
eligible for bail, regardless of the bail’s temporal stage, before or after

his arrest. It stands to reason that its framers would have explicitly 
extended its protection to pre-arrest bail scenarios, had the concept 
been legislatively or judicially recognized at that time. The principle 
of not re-arresting a bailed-out accused without seeking cancellation 
of bail aligns with the broader legal principles of fairness, 
predictability, and respect for judicial decisions. Extending this 
principle to pre-arrest bail cases does not represent a radical departure 
from established legal norms but rather an affirmation of the law’s 
inherent values. It acknowledges that the rationale preventing 
arbitrary re-arrest post-bail applies with equal force to those admitted 
to pre-arrest bail, as both scenarios involve individuals who, in the 
eyes of the law, should not be detained without compelling, judicially 
scrutinized reasons. 
 
12. 
 
Therefore, applying this principle to pre-arrest bail cases 
is both a logical extension of existing legal protections and a 
necessary step to ensure consistency, fairness, and respect for 
individual liberties across the Criminal Justice System. It underscores 
the principle that bail, once granted, recognizes an individual’s right 
to freedom and should not be undermined without due process and 
judicial oversight. This approach strengthens the integrity of the bail 
system and reaffirms the judiciary’s role in safeguarding against the 
arbitrary exercise of power. This procedural sanctity is not merely 
perfunctory; it is the cornerstone upon which the edifice of justice 
rests, ensuring that the liberties of individuals are not trifled with 
capriciously. 
 
13. 
 
Therefore, it is held that the arrest of the accused, in 
blatant contravention of Rule 26.21(6) of the Police Rules, 1934, and 
the principles enshrined within our legal edifice, is both untenable and 
impermissible. The essence of justice demands that once a Court has 
granted bail, pre-arrest or post-arrest, considering the gamut of facts 

Crl. Misc. No. 10162-H/2024 
 
(9) 
and allegations, such a decision must be respected and cannot be 
superseded by subsequent police action without first seeking judicial 
recourse for the cancellation of said bail. To uphold otherwise would 
be to sanction a travesty of justice, undermining both the authority of 
the judiciary and the rights of the accused. It is upon these grounds 
that the sanctity of bail, granted after due deliberation of all pertinent 
facts, must remain inviolable, thereby reinforcing the paramountcy of 
the judiciary in the preservation of justice and the rule of law. 
 
14. 
 
Now, after having held that this Rule is equally 
applicable to the cases of accused who are admitted to pre-arrest bail, 
it is imperative to note that the core issue revolves around the 
infringement of the fundamental rights, particularly the right to life 
and liberty as enshrined under Article 9 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (‘the Constitution’), which unequivocally 
states that “No person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in 
accordance with law.” It is incumbent upon the state and its 
apparatuses to ensure that no individual’s life or liberty is curtailed 
without 
due 
process. 
Moreover, 
the 
procedural 
safeguards 
surrounding arrest and detention, as stipulated under Article 10 of the 
Constitution, have been ostensibly disregarded in this case. It has been 
reiterated more than once by the Constitutional Courts of our country 
that the state and its organs must adhere strictly to the legal provisions 
when depriving any individual of his liberty to ensure that the 
fundamental rights to life and liberty are not transgressed. Respondent 
No.2, by arresting the Detenu without adhering to the proper legal 
channels, has not only disregarded the authority of the Court but also 
violated the rights of the Detenu as enshrined under the law. 
Therefore, the arrest of the Detenu was patently illegal having no legal 
justification.

15. 
 
Today, DIG, OCU, Lahore appears before the Court and 
submits that he has taken cognizance of the matter. He further submits 
that the Detenu should not have been arrested without filing an 
application for cancellation of his bail granted by the Court of 
Sessions. He assures the Court that proper inquiry shall be carried out 
and delinquent police official(s) shall be dealt with strictly as per the 
law.  
 
16. 
While declaring the arrest of the Detenu illegal, this 
petition stands disposed of.
