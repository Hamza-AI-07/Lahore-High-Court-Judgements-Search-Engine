Relief 
 
After recording evidence and hearing arguments from all 
sides, the Referee Court, vide order / decree dated 04.04.2023, 
allowed the Reference Application in the above manner. Hence, 
instant appeal. 
3. 
Learned Legal Advisor for appellant-NHA submits that 
the compensation was enhanced without determining the 
average market price of the land while ignoring Rule 
10(1)(iii)(c) of the Punjab Land Acquisition Rules, 1983. He 
adds that respondents No.1 & 2 failed to prove the exact price 
as well as location of acquired land, thus, were not entitled to 
exorbitant compensation. He maintains that the market value 
was to be assessed on the basis of price existing in preceding 
year of the date of issuance of notification under Section 4 of 
the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. He adds that as the maximum 
compensation was awarded, therefore, respondents No.1 & 2 
were not entitled to 08% compound interest. Lastly, he submits 
that since the available record, evidence and applicable law 
have not been properly appreciated by learned Referee Court, 
therefore, impugned decree is liable to be set aside. In support 
of his contentions, he has relied upon Lahore Ring Road 
Authority and others v. Mian Mumtaz Ahmad and others (2021 
CLC 178) and National Highway Authority, Islamabad through 
Project Director Zafar Mehmood v. Muhammad Afzal Bhatti 
and another (2024 CLC 1246).   
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondents No.1 & 2 
defends the impugned order / decree by contending that learned 
Legal Advisor for appellant-NHA has failed to pinpoint any 
illegality or legal infirmity therein, thus, same is liable to be 
upheld.

5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
This is second round of litigation before this Court. In 
previous round, this Court vide order dated 07.12.2022, passed 
in C.R. No.71874 of 2019, after setting aside the decree dated 
12.09.2018, remanded the matter to the Referee Court for 
decision afresh after impleading appellant-NHA and recording 
evidence thereof. Now, through order / decree under challenge 
in this appeal, the Referee Court has fixed / enhanced the value 
/ price of acquired land, as detailed in commencing paragraph 
of this judgment. Appellant-NHA is not satisfied by the 
decision of the Referee Court and is urging to restore the award 
announced by the Land Acquisition Collector.  
7. 
The pivotal issues No.1 & 2 are inter-linked and inter-
connected, hence collective determination thereof would cause 
no prejudice. The remaining issues No.3 to 7 have not been 
pressed before this Court. The precise controversy is whether 
the value of the acquired land fixed by the Land Acquisition 
Collector constitutes fair and just compensation or that of the 
Referee Court within contemplation of provisions of Sections 
23 & 24 of the Land Acquisition Act 1894?  
8. 
Respondents / landowners adduced 02 witnesses and 
documentary evidence as Ex.A-1 to Ex.A-16, and Mark-A to 
Mark-E. Conversely, appellant-NHA presented 04 witnesses 
and documentary evidence as Ex.R-1 to Ex.R-5. 
9. 
Admittedly, Notification u/s 4 of the Act of 1894 for 
acquiring land measuring 116-Kanal situated in village Mauza 
Kot Kirpa Ram, Tehsil Kamoke, District Gujranwala was 
issued on 09.06.2016 and the Award (Exh.A2) was announced 
on 16.06.2017, according to which the District Price 
Assessment Committee approved the following amount of 
compensation:- 
➢ Rs.16,00,000/- per acre  
 
(main road) 
➢ Rs.15,25,000/- per acre 
 
(off road) 
➢ Rs.15,20,000/- per acre  
 
(kacha road)

RFA No.54482 of 2023 
10. 
Record shows that the Award (Exh.A2) though mentions 
that objections were filed by respondents / landowners, 
however no reasons are forthcoming therefrom which prevailed 
upon LAC to reject the objections. For example, respondents 
have raised objection qua compensation / price of land in 
question by contending that they may be compensated as per 
the market value of the land in question, which comes to 
Rs.26,00,000/- per acre for "main road" land, Rs.24,00,000/- 
per acre for “off road” land and Rs.22,00,000/- per acre for 
"kacha road" land. Likewise, respondents also raised objection 
‘E’ qua non-observance of formalities under Section 23 of the 
Act of 1894 for determination of compensation. However, the 
Land Acquisition Collector announced the award dated 
16.06.2017 without addressing the same. It is pertinent to 
mention here that the award is based upon value assessed by the 
District Price Assessment Committee (which was approved by 
Board of Revenue), however, as per information provided by 
the respondents themselves, which fact is mentioned in the 
Award (Exh.A2) dated 16.06.2017, the field staff had proposed 
the following amounts of compensation:- 
➢ Rs.22,00,000/- per acre  
 
(main road) 
➢ Rs.20,00,000/- per acre 
 
(off road) 
➢ Rs.18,00,000/- per acre  
 
(kacha road) 
  
 
On being faced with the above, learned counsel for 
respondents No.1 & 2 admits that the field staff proposed the 
aforesaid amounts of compensation, however, the same were 
not considered while fixing the compensation of the acquired 
land.  
11. 
It is the stance of appellant-NHA that the value assessed 
by the Referee Court is on higher side. The Referee Court has 
neither taken into consideration the market value of the land nor 
the report of field staff. Evidence brought on record by the 
parties is to be seen in its entirety, stressing less qua the 

6 
RFA No.54482 of 2023 
obligation of the onus to prove, and applying the principle of 
preponderance of evidence. Appellant-NHA has succeeded to 
prove that the amount of compensation determined by learned 
Referee Court is exorbitant. The Referee Court has not properly 
appreciated the material / evidence brought on record, including 
the report mentioned supra, facts of the case, applicable law and 
dictum laid down by the superior Courts while passing the 
impugned decision.  
12. 
Even otherwise, none of the members of the Committee 
was produced in evidence to explain the criteria adopted by it 
while fixing the price. The award as well as impugned decree 
does not reflect independent assessment by the Land 
Acquisition Collector and learned Referee Court keeping in 
view the complexion and character of the acquired land. 
13. 
In view of the above, instant appeal is partly allowed in 
the manner that impugned order / decree dated 04.04.2023 is 
modified to the extent that respondents No.1 & 2 are held 
entitled to get the following amount of compensation, keeping 
in view the report of field staff:- 
➢ Rs.22,00,000/- per acre  
 
(link road) 
➢ Rs.20,00,000/- per acre 
 
(off road) 
➢ Rs.18,00,000/- per acre  
 
(kacha road) 
➢ Rs.30-lac per acre  
 
 
(severed land) 
 
Respondents No.1 & 2 are also held entitled to recover 15% 
compulsory acquisition charges and compound interest @ 8% 
from the date of possession of the acquired land to the date of 
payment of enhanced amount of compensation
