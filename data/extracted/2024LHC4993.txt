[2]                     28.10.2024.    Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Dhudhi, Advocate for the petitioner.

Rai Zameer ul Hassan, Advocate for respondent No.3. 
 
 
 
This petition assails order dated 07.06.2024, passed 
by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Hafizabad, whereby 
accused/respondent Rai Muhammad Aslam Kharal was 
permanently exempted from his appearance in the trial on 
the ground that he is earning his livelihood abroad; though 
learned Magistrate by virtue of order dated 08.05.2024 had 
dismissed his application.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner states that vent 
under sections 540A and 205 in Code of Criminal 
Procedure 1898 (the Code) accommodates the accused to 
appear and seek exemption of his attendance in the trial if 
he is incapable of remaining before the Court contingent 
upon happening of an event like illness and other infirmities 
or disabilities yet this facility is available only for a certain 
period and such sections cannot be interpreted in the 
manner so as to accommodate the “earning of livelihood 
abroad” which of course is the wrong interpretation.  
3. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent 
No.3 states that it was a case under section 337A(ii) 
Pakistan Penal Code 1860 (PPC) and respondent was under 
the allegation of hurling lalkara only; he being National of 
Great Britain while appearing in the Court has sought his 
permanent exemption of attendance in the trial and the 
course adopted by learned Additional Sessions Judge by 
permitting him to appear through two dignified lawyers is 
well within the parameters of law because the words used in 

 
Crl. Misc. No.40397-M of 2024 
 
2 
 
section 540A of the Code “incapable of remaining before 
the Court” supports the idea. In this respect, learned counsel 
for the respondent has placed reliance on the cases reported 
as “Haji AURANGZEB versus MUSHTAQ AHMAD and 
another” (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 160), “MUHAMMAD 
NAWAZ versus The STATE and another” [2015 PCr.LJ 58 
(Lahore)] and “AFTAB AHMAD versus The STATE through 
Assistant Advocate-General, Rawalkot” [2019 PCr.LJ 267 
[Shariat Court (AJ & K)] and states that incapacity does 
include „earning livelihood abroad‟. 
 
4. 
I have gone through the impugned order and attended 
the contentions of learned counsel (s) for the parties 
  
5. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Haji AURANGZEB 
versus MUSHTAQ AHMAD and another” (PLD 2004 
Supreme Court 160) though has denied relief of exemption 
from trial to the accused who was abroad yet only on 
ground that at the time of filing application accused was not 
before the Court; however, it did not declare that being 
abroad cannot be read as “incapable of remaining before 
the Court”. Thus, held as under; 
“………the provisions of section 540-A, Cr.P.C. are to be 
interpreted with benevolence, because it is an enabling 
provision not meant to punish someone. The section, in 
the circumstances, aims at achieving three-fold benefit. 
One benefit being that of the exempted accused, second 
being that of the co-accused under trial and third being 
the convenience of the Court itself. To my mind the only 
lacking feature in the instant case is that the accused 
asking for exemption has not been present before the 
Court. For this one and the only short coming, the grant 
of exemption was rightly denied to him. 
 
That was the reason this Court in a case reported as 
“MUHAMMAD NAWAZ versus The STATE and another” [2015 
PCr.LJ 58 (Lahore)] has held that “incapable of remaining 
before the Court” does include earning of livelihood abroad. 
Same was the ratio of case reported as “AFTAB AHMAD 
versus The STATE through Assistant Advocate-General, 
Rawalkot” [2019 PCr.LJ 267 [Shariat Court (AJ & K)].  
Thus, learned counsel for respondent/accused has rightly 

 
Crl. Misc. No.40397-M of 2024 
 
3 
 
pointed out the legal position as settled through case laws 
cited by him as well as the followings; 
“MUHAMMAD LATIF versus ZAHEER IQBAL and 
another” [2020 MLD 160 (AJ & K High Court); 
“INTIZAR HUSSAN and another versus AMJAD 
HUSSAIN 
and 
another” 
[2023 
PCr.LJ 
596 
(Islamabad)]; 
“Raja 
PERVEZ 
ASHRAF 
Versus 
FEDERATION 
OF 
PAKISTAN 
through 
Secretary 
Ministry of Interior, Islamabad and 2 others” (PLD 
2020 Islamabad 24); and “SAJJAD AKBAR versus The 
STATE through Advocate General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 
Peshawar 
and 
3 
others” 
[2022 
MLD 
1325 
(Peshawar)]. 
 
6.    Section 540A of the Code is an enabling provision as 
held by Supreme Court of Pakistan as well, therefore, it is 
essential to see it again to discover the possibilities under 
such section. For reference section is reproduced as follows; 
540-A. Provision for inquiries and trial being held in the 
absence of accused in certain cases: (1) At any stage of an 
inquiry or trial under this Code, where two or more accused 
are before the Court, if the Judge or Magistrate is satisfied, 
for reasons to, be recorded, that any one or more of such 
accused is or are incapable of remaining before the Court, he 
may, if such accused is represented by a pleader, dispense 
with his attendance and proceed with such inquiry or trial in 
his absence, and may at any subsequent stage of the 
proceedings, direct the personal attendance of such accused.  
 
(2) If the accused in any such case is not represented by a 
pleader, or if the Judge or Magistrate considers his personal 
attendance necessary, he may, if he thinks fit, and for reasons 
to be recorded by him either adjourn such inquiry or trial, or 
order that the case of such accused be taken up or tried 
separately. 
 
The 
word 
“incapable” 
was 
derived 
from 
Late 
Latin word “incapābilis” which literally means unable to 
do or achieve (something); unable to behave rationally or 
manage one's affairs. In this context ageism has become 
institutionalized and contributes to the view that elderly 
people are socially redundant, incapable and dependent. 
Keeping in view the above definition, following could be 
the reasons for accused to hold them incapable of 
remaining before the Court; 
  
“Advance age, child, woman particularly Parda-Nasheen 
lady, infirm, sick, epidemic outbreak, bereavement in 
family, ceremonial occupations, festive occasions, law and 
order situation, national duty, election affairs, religious 
duty, official commitments or duty, professional trainings 

 
Crl. Misc. No.40397-M of 2024

inland or abroad, medical treatment abroad, earning of 
livelihood out of city or abroad, visit abroad, dual 
national,” 
 
Above list is not exhaustive which would include any other 
situation arising out of exigency or emergency response. 
Section 540A of the Code requires personal attendance of 
accused for seeking exemption, therefore, exemption of 
one day or two due to certain emergency situation in the 
absence of accused would not be legally permissible under 
such section, however, Court by virtue of its inherent 
power can allow such exemption.   
 
7.     Exemption of accused from attendance for a longer 
period is always read as detrimental to expeditious trial but 
legislator has also taken care of such issue while 
introducing Section 540(2) of the Code which is a saving 
clause for the regime of criminal trial; it guarantees course 
and measures for uninterrupted process during the trial. It 
suggests that at any stage Court can direct the attendance 
of exempted accused or if his pleader does not represent 
him, Court can safely adjourn such inquiry or trial, or order 
that the case of such accused be taken up or tried 
separately which of course would not affect the case of co-
accused. Even otherwise for every distinct offence of 
which any person is accused there shall be a separate 
charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately 
(Section 233 of the Code), whereas joint trial of different 
accused is only an exception as mentioned in section 239 
of Cr.P.C. Court can resort to all permissible coercive 
measures side by side for procuring the attendance of 
exempted accused including issuance of warrants for 
execution under sections 82 or 93B of the Code (within or 
out of country) followed by process of proclamation and 
attachment of property. (Sections 87 & 88 of the Code) 
 
 
8.     No doubt expeditious trial is the hallmark of criminal 
justice system and Chapter-2, Part-II of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 (the Constitution) 

 
Crl. Misc. No.40397-M of 2024 
 
5 
 
dealing with Principles of Policy (Articles 29-40) on the 
strength of Article 37(d) ordains that “it is the 
constitutional duty to ensure inexpensive and expeditious 
justice.” Article 29 of the Constitution states that it is the 
responsibility of each organ and authority of the State, and 
of each person performing functions on behalf of an organ 
or authority of the State, to act in accordance with those 
Principles in so far as they relate to the functions of the 
organ or authority. Article 29 (2) of the Constitution says 
that in so far as the observance of any particular Principle 
of Policy may be dependent upon resources being available 
for the purpose, the principle shall be regarded as being 
subject to the availability of resources. 
 
         Availability 
of 
resources 
of 
course 
includes 
cooperation of parties, existence of sound processes or 
measures to take the offender on to the trial for early 
decision of the cases. If the processes are weak or not 
responding in due course of time then Court should resort 
to alternatives to ensure expeditious justice. Applying 
above theme on the situation that if time and again 
attendance of accused delays the process, then it is the 
bounden duty of the Court to exempt him from appearance 
and continue with trial in the presence of his counsel, and 
on default, adjourn or separate his trial.  
 
9.    Section 353 of the Code requires recording of 
evidence in the presence of accused or in presence of his 
counsel if his attendance has been dispensed with. Though 
this section talks about physical presence of accused but in 
case reported as “MUHAMMAD HANIF VS THE STATE 
ETC.” (PLJ 2023 Cr. C 412), while dealing with mental 
disability, it was held that mental presence of accused is 
also essential otherwise trial would a farce. Similarly, as an 
alternative his „physical presence‟ can also be substituted 
with his „virtual presence‟ by the use of modern 
technology like video link (live link, skype etc.), which has 

 
Crl. Misc. No.40397-M of 2024 
 
6 
 
not been specifically prohibited. The Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in a case reported as “MEERA SHAFI Versus ALI 
ZAFAR” 
(PLD 
2023 
Supreme 
Court 
211) 
has 
recommended 
the 
idea 
of 
‘Virtual 
Attendance’ 
substituting it with actual or physical presence. It has 
further been required from the Courts to extend the 
application of statutes to new things in order to respond the 
changing social realities of the time. It has held as under; 
 
“In order to answer the above question, it is important 
to highlight the conceptual role of a court in a 
constitutional democracy. The role of a judge is to 
understand the purpose of law in the society and to 
help the law achieve its purpose. Law is a living 
organism and must respond to the changing social 
realities of the time. Indeed, when social reality 
changes, the law must change too. Just as the change in 
social reality is the law of life, responsiveness to 
change in social reality is the life of the law.” 
                                    
Further that 
 
“The principle of extension of statutes to new things, 
referred to by this Court in the Fakir Muhammad case 
in 1958, has over the years been crystallized into the 
principle of "updating construction" of statutes. As the 
constant formal updating of all laws by the legislature 
is not practicable and each generation mostly lives 
under the law it inherits, the legislature is presumed to 
have intended that the laws enacted by it should 
ordinarily be taken as "always speaking" and applied 
at any future time in such a way that gives effect to its 
intention in the changed circumstances that have 
occurred since the enactment of the law. This is 
commonly called the "updating construction" of 
laws.5 The 
changes 
that 
require 
the 
updating 
construction of law may include technological or 
scientific developments, new natural phenomena or 
changes in social conditions, etc. 'It is not difficult to 
see why an updating construction of legislation is 
generally to be preferred. Legislation is not and could 
not be constantly re-enacted and is generally expected 
to remain in place indefinitely, until it is repealed, for 
what may be a long period of time.” 
 
In the said judgment it was also held that regarding the 
procedural law, it is a well-settled principle that the 
Courts are not to act upon the principle that every 
procedure is to be taken to be prohibited unless it is 
expressly provided for by the law, but on the converse 
principle that every procedure is to be understood as 
permissible till it is shown to be prohibited by law.

Therefore, allowing modern technology of video 
conferencing to be read into the exiting enactments 
enhances access to justice, promotes fair trial and 
introduces inexpensive and expeditious justice thereby 
advancing the fundamental rights under Articles 9 and 
10A and principle of policy under Article 37(d) of the 
Constitution. In a case reported as “Khawaja ANWER 
MAJID Versus NATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY BUREAU 
through Chairman NAB and another” (PLD 2020 
Supreme Court 635), Supreme Court of Pakistan while 
granting bail to the accused therein permitted him to join 
investigation as and when required by the NAB and also 
ensure his representation before the Accountability Court, 
either personally or through video link, whichever is found 
convenient under the circumstances. In the event of physical 
incapacity, his request for dispensation and representation 
through a counsel shall be considered most thoughtfully. In 
a case reported as “IMRAN AHMAD KHAN NIAZI Versus 
SPECIAL JUDGE, (Anti-Terrorism Court), Lahore and 3 
others” (PLD 2004 Lahore 486), a Division Bench of this 
Court, in the backdrop of particular circumstances, allowed 
the accused to appear in pre-arrest bail proceedings via 
Video link.  
10.    Frencis Bennion has set out the principle of 
interpretation in his commentative titled "Statutory 
interpretation" 2nd Edition Page 617. According to him 
"Acts can be divided into two categories, namely, the 
usual case of the Act that is intended to develop its 
meaning with developing circumstances (which may be 
called an ongoing Act) and the comparatively rare case 
of the Act that is intended to be of unchanging effect (a 
fixed-time Act)”. In cases reported as “MUNAWAR 
HUSSAIN and another Versus The STATE” (2020 PCr.LJ 
1184) & “MUHAMMAD ISRAR Versus the STATE and 
another” (PLD 2021 Peshawar 105) Courts have held 
that the Code, is an ongoing statutory instrument and that 
doctrine “contemporanea expositio est optima et fortissima 

 
Crl. Misc. No.40397-M of 2024 
 
8 
 
in lege” which means that a contemporary explanation or 
interpretation of a statute is the best and strongest (the 
language of a statute must be understood in the sense in 
which it was understood when it was passed), has no 
application while interpreting the Code. Thus, on the 
strength of above referred case law, it is held that presence 
of accused during the trial through modern means like 
video link etc. will not be illegal in any manner.   
 
11.   Attendance of the accused can be procured at any 
stage including for hearing of the judgment because 
section 366 (2) Cr.P.C. requires that judgment must be 
pronounced in the presence of accused but where his 
personal attendance during the trial has been dispensed 
with and the sentence is one of fine only or he is acquitted, 
either of which cases it may be delivered in the presence of 
his pleader. In other case, if the accused did not appear, it 
will not preclude the Court to pronounce it in his absence 
because section 366(3) says that no judgment delivered by 
any Criminal Court shall be deemed to be invalid by 
reason only of the absence of any party or his pleader on 
the day or from the place notified for the delivery thereof, 
or of any omission to serve, or defect in serving, on the 
parties or their pleaders, or any of them, the notice of such 
day and place.  Thus, even if the accused is convicted in 
his absence, still perpetual warrant of his arrest can be 
issued to make it directive for serving out the sentence 
passed against him. 
 
 
12.  It is trite that there is difference between conviction 
and sentence; conviction is a guilty verdict while sentence 
is a period of imprisonment or probation to be served out 
or payment of fine under such guilty verdict. Though 
corporal punishment plays an important role in eradication 
of vices and also helps to lower the crime rate yet 
conviction is also a major obstacle for individuals to 
penetrate into the society with respectable protocols. 

 
Crl. Misc. No.40397-M of 2024

Criminal justice system though focusses on prevention, 
eradication and elimination of vices from the society yet 
by introducing different sentencing policies, main focus is 
on correction, reformation and rehabilitation of offenders 
to make them useful citizen. Stigma of conviction can only 
be vanished by the judicial verdict of higher forum 
whereas sentence can also be waived of or regulated by the 
executive authority of government or by the President, by 
way of remission, commutation or by grant of pardon, 
reprieve and respite, as per Sections 54 & 55 of PPC, 
Sections 401, 402 & 402A of the Code and Article 45 of 
the Constitution respectively.  
 
Keeping the sentence apart, conviction plays a vital role in 
deterrence and prohibition against the crimes because 
conviction solely brings many restrictions on the convicted 
persons; some of which can be calculated as under; 
1. 
Disqualification of a Convict from being 
Member of Parliament as per Article 63 of the 
Constitution and under sections 231 and 232 of the 
Election Act, 2017. 
 
2. 
Section 15 of the National Accountability 
Bureau Ordinance, 1999 also disqualifies a convict to 
contest election or hold Public Office for a period of 10 
years and to apply for or be granted or allowed any 
financial facilities in the form of any loan or advances or 
other financial accommodation by any bank or financial 
institution owned or controlled by the Government for a 
period of 10 years from the date of conviction. 
 
3. 
Article 3 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
bars the competency of a convict of Perjury, to be a 
witness unless the court is satisfied about his repentance 
and mending ways. 
 
4. 
A convicted person is also disqualified to be a 
Civil Servant and if being a public servant is convicted 
for a particular criminal case, he stands disqualified to 
hold the office as a consequence of that conviction. 
Section 8 of the Punjab Employees Efficiency, 
Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006 and the Punjab 
Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules are 
referred. 
 
5. 
Enhanced punishment for certain offenders 
under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII after previous 
conviction. (Section 75 of PPC). Section 11 of the 

 
Crl. Misc. No.40397-M of 2024 
 
10 
 
Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 for repetition 
of same offence.  
 
6. 
Rule-23 (d), Passport Rules, 2021 formulated 
under the Passport Act, 1974 provides for impounding, 
confiscation, cancellation and inactivation of Passport 
if any Pakistani is convicted in the host country of a 
crime involving moral turpitude. 
 
7. 
The Arms Policy 2012 issued by the Ministry of 
Interior, Government of Pakistan disqualify and debars 
all convicted persons, except those convicted for minor 
offences or traffic violations, from acquiring any kind of 
arms licence.  
 
8. 
 Sections 18-20 of the Provincial Motor Vehicles 
Ordinance, 1965 empower the Court convicting a person 
to be disqualified to hold a driving licence for a particular 
period. 
 
9. 
Section 20(9) of the Financial Institutions 
(Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 provides for 
ineligibility to receive any loan, advance or finance upon 
conviction of offence of willful default by a Banking 
Court. 
 
10. 
Section 3(4) of the National Database and 
Registration Authority Ordinance, 2000 places a 
prohibition upon a convict to be the Chairman of the 
establishment. 
 
Thus, conviction alone is a great impediment to flourish in 
the society peacefully and effectively. 
 
13.     There is an apprehension that taking the accused in 
the process of trial through video link would jeopardize the 
sanctity of Courts and protection of judges if the accused on 
the other side join it through his house or workplace and 
create any obstruction or commit contempt of court by 
words or by other means. Section 352 of the Code says that 
“Courts to be open” which means that the place in which 
any Criminal Court is held for the purpose of inquiring into 
or trying any offence shall be deemed an open Court, to 
which the public generally may have access, so far as the 
same can conveniently contain them. As such live telecast 
of Court proceedings is permissible under said section. The 
only requirement is the control of judge to maintain the 

 
Crl. Misc. No.40397-M of 2024 
 
11 
 
Court decorum which can be managed as per proviso of 
said section; it says as under; 
“Provided that the Presiding Judge or Magistrate may, if he 
thinks fit, order at any stage of any inquiry into or trial of, 
any particular case, that the public generally, or any 
particular person, shall not have access to, or be or remain 
in, the room or building used by the Court.”  
 
If the Judge suspects that he cannot control the situation of 
other side on video link when the accused joins the process 
from his house or work place, he can direct to an 
appropriate authority 
for alternate arrangement for 
appearance of accused on video link if he is in Pakistan or if 
abroad, to pass on such direction to concerned High 
Commission for arrangement of place suggested by the 
Commission. Thus, during the trial if the accused is 
incapable of remaining before the Court, he can seek his 
physical exemption for appearance either through lawyer or 
through virtual presence on video link.  
 
14.     Consequently, order dated 07.06.2024, passed by the 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Hafizabad does not call 
for any interference by this Court. Before parting with this 
judgment, I acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of Mr. 
Balal Munir, Civil Judge/Research Officer who collected 
and provided relevant material in support of question 
involved in this case.
