JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing 
30.10.2024 
Appellant by 
Mr. Raheel Ahmad Sheikh, Advocate 
Respondents by: 
Barrister Syed Sajjad Haider Rizvi, 
AAG-Pk. for Registrar of Trade Marks 
(respondent No.1). 
Respondent No.2 (in FAO No.433/2014) 
& Respondent (in RFAs No.1073 & 1074 
of 2014) already proceeded against     
ex parte on 19.11.2020 and (in RFA 
No.1077/2014) on 22.11.2023.  
 
 
 
 
ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J.  This judgment will also 
decide RFAs No.1073, 1074 and 1077 of 2014 being 
interconnected and common questions of law and facts raised 
in all these appeals. 
2. 
Relevant facts are that the appellants (Muhammad 
Qasim) being proprietor of Registered Trade Mark No.210893 
in Class 35 for the trade mark M/s “Hafiz Pipe Store” with 
Logo w.e.f. 25.06.2005 (Trade Mark) filed three separate 
suits against respondents (in RFAs No.1073, 1074 and 
1077/2014) for the grant of permanent injunction etc. against 

 
 
FAO No.433/2014 
-2- 
 
 
 
 
infringement of above registered trade mark as well as 
damages caused to the appellant for loss and injury due to sale 
and profit made by the defendants therein. The said suits were 
filed before the District Court Faisalabad on 07.10.2010 and 
during pendency of these suits, one Asghar Ali (respondent 
No.2 in this FAO No.433/2014) filed application on 
09.04.2011 before the Trade Marks Registrar (Registrar) 
under section 73, 80 and 96 of the Trade Mark Ordinance, 
2001 (Ordinance) read with rule 68 of the Trade Mark Rules, 
2004 (Rules) for revocation, invalidation and rectification of 
the Trade Mark. The said application was ex parte allowed by 
the Registrar on 28.06.2014. After aforesaid order of the 
Registrar, the defendants (respondents in RFAs) in all three 
suits filed separate applications under Order VII Rule 11 of 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) for rejection of plaints. 
Consequently through impugned orders dated 27.06.2014, the 
plaints in all three suits were rejected on the ground that trade 
mark of the appellant had been revoked by the Registrar on 
12.05.2014. The appellant being aggrieved of the order passed 
by the Registrar dated 12.05.2014 and orders passed by the 
learned Addl. District Judge, Faisalabad dated 27.06.2014, has 
filed these four connected appeals.

3. 
Despite service, no one appeared on behalf of 
contesting respondents who have already been proceeded 
against ex parte in FAO No.433/2014, RFAs No.1073 & 1074 
of 2014 on 19.11.2020 and in RFA No.1077 of 2014 on 
22.11.2023.  
4. 
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the 
impugned order dated 12.05.2014 by the Registrar was passed 
ex parte without giving any proper notice of hearing to the 
appellant. He submits that the civil suits concerning Trade 
Mark in question being already pending before the District 
Court, Faisalabad, the revocation of trade mark application 
could not be entertained by the Registrar and he was required 
to refer the said application to the District Court, where the 
suits were already pending. Submits that the three suits of the 
appellant were not only for the infringement of the Trade Mark 
but they were also on the basis of claim of passing off the 
goods. Submits that even if the Trade Mark was revoked, the 
suits were still maintainable to the extent of passing off goods, 
hence plaints could not be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 
CPC.  
5. 
Learned Law Officer assisted on the legal questions 
raised and submits that after promulgation of The Intellectual 
Property Organization of Pakistan Act, 2012 (Act of 2012), the 

 
 
FAO No.433/2014 
-4- 
 
 
 
 
jurisdiction in respect of intellectual property matters including 
the revocation, invalidation and rectification applications and 
trade mark infringement are with the Intellectual Property 
Tribunal (Tribunal) constituted under the Act of 2012. 
6. 
Arguments heard. The record shows that the 
appellant’s three suits for permanent and mandatory 
injunction, damages for the infringement of Trade Mark and 
on account of sale and profit made by the respondents in RFAs 
No.1073/2014, 1074/2014 & 1077/2014 (defendants) were 
filed on 07.10.2010. The relief sought in all three suits was 
same, however to better appreciate the proposition in hand, the 
prayer clause of one of the suits titled “Muhammad Qasim vs. 
Hafiz Muhammad Arshad” is reproduced hereunder:-  
“Under the circumstances, it is therefore, respectfully 
prayed that a decree for 
 
(a) Permanent injunction restraining the defendant, 
their servant agents, employees and all persons 
claiming through or under defendants jointly/ and 
or severally from infringing the plaintiff’s 
registered Trade Mark/Trade Name and copy 
righted word ‘Hafiz (حافظ) in any manner 
whatsoever by using the said Trade Mark/Title 
‘Hafiz’ (حافظ) for their goods and services. 
(b) For a decree directing the defendant to furnish 
accounts of sales and profits made by the 
defendant through use of Trade mark/Title ‘Hafiz’ 
(حافظ) and to make payment to the plaintiff of all 
such sum as may be found due upon taking of such 
accounts. 
(c) To direct the defendant to make payment of 
damages to the plaintiff for loss and injury caused 
to the plaintiff. 

 
 
FAO No.433/2014

(d) A decree directing the defendant to deliver up to 
the 
plaintiff 
all 
the 
advertising 
material, 
promotional material, goods, blocks, plats and all 
other materials bearing the infringing Trade Mark 
and Service Mark ‘Hafiz’. 
(e) For the cost of suit. 
(f) Any other relief which this honourable Court 
deems fit may also be granted.” 
 
7. 
In the above said suits, the issues were framed on 
11.11.2013 and the matters were pending for recording of 
evidence. During pendency of the suits, one Asghar Ali 
(respondent No.2 in FAO No.433/2014) filed application 
under section 73, 80 and 96 of the Ordinance for revocation, 
invalidation and rectification of Trade Mark on 09.04.2011 
before the Registrar. For convenience section 73(4) of the 
Ordinance prevailing at the relevant time is reproduced 
hereunder:- 
“73(4).   An application for revocation may be made 
by an interested party to the Registrar, except that-  
 
 
(a)  if proceedings concerning the trade 
mark in question are pending in the High 
Court or a District Court, the application 
shall be made to the High Court or as the 
case may be; and 
  
(b)  in case the application is made to the 
Registrar, he may at any stage of the 
proceedings refer the application to the 
High Court or a District Court.” 
 
Provisions of section 80(4) and 96(2) of the Ordinance are 
similar to section 73(4) above.   

 
 
FAO No.433/2014 
-6- 
 
 
 
 
8. 
Section 73 relates to the revocation of trade mark, 
section 80 relates to the invalidation of trade mark whereas 
section 96 of the Ordinance relates to the rectification of 
Registered Trade Mark. Under sections 73(4), 80(4) and 96(2) 
of the Ordinance, if the proceedings concerning the Trade 
Mark in question are pending in High Court or District Court, 
the application shall be made to the said Court for revocation, 
invalidation or rectification. In case the application is made to 
the Registrar, he may at any stage of the proceedings refer the 
application to the said Court. The legislative intent emanating 
from the above provisions is that there ought not be piecemeal 
adjudication of intellectual property claims in relation to the 
same trade mark. The purpose is to avoid conflicting decisions 
and to encourage consistency of views on proceedings 
concerning the trade mark in question.  
9. 
In present case, admittedly suits concerning Trade 
Mark were already pending before the District Court, 
Faisalabad since 07.10.2010, therefore the revocation/ 
invalidation/rectification application under section 73, 80 and 
96 of the Ordinance was required to be filed before the District 
Court or when the same was filed before the Registrar, the 
Registrar was required to refer the same to the District Court 
where the suits were already pending. Perusal of the impugned 

 
 
FAO No.433/2014 
-7- 
 
 
 
 
order dated 12.05.2014 passed by the Registrar shows that this 
fact was neither brought to the notice of the Registrar by the 
respondent nor this question was even discussed in the 
impugned order dated 12.05.2014. The appellant was also not 
heard before passing of the impugned order though he was 
duly represented as evident from various emails on behalf of 
his counsel (Mr. Raheel Ahmad Sheikh, Advocate).  
10. 
From prayer clause of the suits reproduced in para 6 
above, it is manifest that the suits filed by the appellant were 
based upon infringement of registered Trade Mark of the 
appellant at the relevant time, therefore, the suits will fall 
within the term “proceedings” under section 73(4), 80(4) and 
96(2) of the Ordinance. The term “proceedings” has been 
elaborated by the Supreme Court in The State through 
Advocate General, N.W.F.P., Peshawar vs. Naeemullah Khan 
(2001 SCMR 1461) as under:-  
“Keeping in view the literary meaning and the, 
interpretation 
of 
the 
word 
‘proceedings’ 
as 
interpreted in various pronouncements given above, 
we are of the opinion that the word ‘proceedings’ is a 
comprehensive expression which includes every step 
taken towards further progress of a cause in Court or 
Tribunal, from its commencement till its disposal. In 
legal terminology the word “proceedings” means the 
instituting or carrying on of an action of law. 
Generally, a ‘proceedings’ is the form and manner of 
conducting judicial business before a Court or 
judicial officer, including all possible steps in an 
action from its commencement to the execution of a 
judgment and in a more particular sense it is any 

 
 
FAO No.433/2014 
-8- 
 
 
 
 
application to a Court of justice for aid in 
enforcement of rights, for relief, for redress of 
injuries, or damages or for any remedial object. It in 
its general use comprehends every step taken or 
measure adopted in prosecution or defence of an 
action.” 
 
11. 
Being proceedings concerning Trade Mark were 
already pending before the District Court, Faisalabad, the 
respondent Asghar Ali was required to file application before 
the District Court instead of Registrar and even if the 
application was filed before the Registrar, he was required to 
transfer the same before the Court where proceedings 
concerning the Trade Mark were already pending. The similar 
view was also expressed by this Court in ITALFARMACO 
S.P.A. vs. HIMONT PHARMACEUTICALS (PVT.) LTD and 
another (2017 CLD 1382) where this Court returned the 
application for declaration of invalidation of Trade Mark under 
section 80(4) of the Ordinance for placing it before the Court 
where proceedings were pending. The same view was also 
expressed in Royal PVC (Pvt.) Ltd. through Authorized Officer 
vs. Registrar of Trade Marks and another (2011 CLD 833), 
Messrs H&B, General Trading company through Director vs. 
Messrs International Marketing Company through Proprietor 
and 2 others (2009 CLD 1028), Messrs H&B General Trading 
Company through Director vs. Messrs International Marketing 
Company through Proprietor and 2 others (2009 CLD 318) 

 
 
FAO No.433/2014 
-9- 
 
 
 
 
and Messrs H & B General Trading Company through 
Director vs. Messrs International Marketing Company through 
Proprietor and 2 others (2009 CLD 354). In view of above 
discussion, the impugned order dated 12.05.2014 of the 
Registrar (subject matter of FAO No.433/2014) is not 
sustainable on this ground alone and the application is required 
to be referred and decided by the Court where suits were 
pending.  
12. 
The perusal of the impugned orders dated 27.06.2014 
by Additional District Court, Faisalabad (subject matter of 
RFAs) shows that plaints were rejected under Order VII Rule 
11 CPC on the sole ground that prima facie Trade Mark 
registration was cancelled by Registrar on 12.05.2014. 
However this fact was not considered that the appellant case 
was not only for the infringement of trade mark but also 
damages on the basis of passing off goods. Further once the 
Registrar’s order dated 15.05.2014 is found to be without 
jurisdiction by this Court, the impugned orders dated 
27.06.2014 for rejection of plaint on the basis of Registrar’s 
order dated 12.05.2014 are also not sustainable. 
13. 
Before parting with the Judgment, it is relevant to 
note that presently the matters relating to intellectual property 
rights are governed under the Act of 2012. The purpose of the 

 
 
FAO No.433/2014 
-10- 
 
 
 
 
said Act of 2012 as per its preamble is to provide institutional 
arrangement for taking up exclusively and comprehensively all 
steps and matters regarding the intellectual property rights in 
integrated manner. Section 2(h) of the Act of 2012 defines the 
intellectual property laws as the laws specified in the schedule 
to the Act of 2012 which include the Ordinance. Section 16 of 
the Act of 2012 provides for creation of Intellectual Property 
Tribunals and under section 17 and 18 of the Act of 2012, the 
Tribunals will have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of matters 
under which the jurisdiction of the Tribunal extends under the 
Act of 2012. In this regard reliance is also placed on 
Muhammad Multazam Raza vs. Muhammad Ayub Khan and 
others (2022 SCMR 979) and Messrs Shaheen Chemist 
through Proprietors and 3 others vs. Zahid Mehmood 
Chaudhry and another (2023 CLD 1). Therefore, now the 
instant matters on remand are to be dealt with by the Tribunal 
instead of District Court mentioned in sections 73, 80 and 96 
of the Ordinance at the relevant time. 
14. 
In view of above discussion, all these appeals are 
allowed, the impugned order dated 12.05.2014 passed by the 
Registrar and impugned orders dated 27.06.2014 passed by the 
Additional District Judge, Faisalabad are set aside and the 
matters are remitted back to the Tribunal where the application 

 
 
FAO No.433/2014 
-11- 
 
 
 
 
filed by the respondent (Asghar Ali) under sections 73, 80 and 
96 of the Ordinance and suits filed by the appellant shall deem 
to be pending and will be decided afresh through reasoned and 
speaking order.
