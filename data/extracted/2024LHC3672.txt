SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:- Through 
this single judgment, I intend to decide the captioned 
petition as well as Constitutional Petitions No. 10609 and 
10611 of 2024, involving similar question(s) of law and 
facts. 
2.   
 
The facts of the titled case are that Muhammad 
Shafi and Muhammad Yaseen (respondent No. 2 and 3) 
instituted suit dated 04.10.2014 (the „suit’) seeking 
declaration with respect to inherited property as detailed in

the relevant paragraphs of the suit. Ex-parte proceedings 
were initiated against the defendants of the suit and on the 
basis of ex-parte evidence, the suit was decreed. On 
18.03.2022 the petitioner instituted an application under 
section 12(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the 
„Code’), inter alia, on the grounds that her mother namely 
Mst. Nusrat daughter of Ferozedin died in the year 2012, 
whereas, she has been fraudulently reflected in the array of 
parties as defendant No. 8 in the suit; that some death 
certificates, appended with the suit were bogus. The 
petitioner has sought to set-aside ex-parte judgment and 
decree. The learned trial Court framed the issues on 
20.05.2023 and initiated the process of adducing evidence. 
After oral evidence certain documents were marked as 
Ex.PA-1 to Ex.PA-29 in the without oath statement of the 
learned counsel given on 21.06.2023. In this regard, separate 
short order was also passed by the learned trial Court 
reflecting that the evidence of the petitioner has been 
completed and directed the other side to produce their 
evidence. On 27.06.2023 respondents No. 2 to 5 and 11 to 
13 filed an application to de-exhibit the aforementioned 
documents with the stance that the law does not permit 
documents to be marked as exhibits in the statement of the 
learned advocate, depriving them from their right to cross-
examine the relevant witness(s); without referring to any 
documents objection was also taken in the application that 
some documents issued from Kenya have been marked as  
exhibit without complying with the provision of relevant

law. After contest on this application, on 19.10.2023 the 
learned trial Court passed another order to de-exhibit the 
documents which were earlier allocated numbers from 
Ex.PA-1 to Ex.PA-29. This order was assailed in Civil 
Revision No. 83 of 2023 which was dismissed by the learned 
revisional Court vide judgment dated 29.01.2024. Aggrieved 
from the same, Mst. Afia Ambrine has instituted the titled 
petition as well as the connected petitions, under Article 199 
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
3.  
 
Mr. Muhammad Akhtar Rana, learned counsel 
for the petitioner has submitted that the documents were 
brought on record in the presence of learned opposing 
counsel, who never raised any objection for producing the 
said documents, in without oath statement. Learned counsel 
for the petitioner has contended that the learned revisional 
Court has ignored that order dated 19.10.2023 is passed in 
mechanical manners and without application of judicial 
mind; that the order to de-exhibit is against the principle 
settled by the learned Islamabad High Court in case titled 
“Malik Riazullah Versus Mst. Dilnasheen and Others”1 as 
well as by this Court in case titled “Muhammad Arif and 
Others Versus Aziz-ur-Rehman and Others”2. Learned 
counsel for the petitioner has stated that the expression “de-
exhibit” is neither defined nor mentioned in the Code; that 
the order of de-exhibiting or removing the documents from 
record is illegal being alien to the provisions of the Code. It

is added by the learned counsel for the petitioner that 
somehow the learned two Courts below have ignored that 
the documents which have been brought on record, in the 
application under section 12(2) of the Code, as exhibits were 
already part of the record in the suit which was ex-parte 
decreed on 20.04.2016 and when the opponent party has 
relied on the same documents they should have been 
construed as admitted documents and in such circumstances 
there was no scope to pass an order of de-exhibit.  
4.  
 
Mian Umar Farooq, learned counsel for 
respondents No. 2 to 5 and 11 to 13, has vehemently 
opposed this petition. He contended that the learned trial 
Court on 21.06.2023 permitted the petitioner-side to bring on 
record the documents in the without oath statement of her 
learned advocate and such practice has repeatedly been 
discouraged by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, thus, the 
order based on error of law and in defiance of the guidelines 
given by the Supreme Court is liable to be corrected by way 
of passing an order to de-exhibit those documents. The 
learned counsel for the respondents has supported the 
impugned judgment and the order while stating that the 
respondents, by allowing the documents to be brought on 
record through the above without oath statement, were 
deprived from their right to cross-examine as to the same. 
He further contended that order to mark exhibits to the 
documents was passed in absence of the representative of the 
respondents and the objection was then taken just within five

It is now well settled that the objections with 
respect to admissibility of the documents can be of two 
kinds: (a) document is inadmissible in evidence being 
irrelevant or not capable for being considered in evidence 
(hereinafter called as the “inadmissibility in evidence”); and 
(b) objections directed towards the mode of proof due to 
irregularity or insufficiency (hereinafter called as the “mode 
of proof”). If no objection is raised as to the inadmissibility 
in evidence but just the mode of proof, after the document 
has been marked as exhibit, the principle of waiver for 
failing to raise objection as to the formal validity can be 
attracted. The proper time for raising such objection as to 
formal validity or the mode of proof is prior to marking a 
document as exhibit or at the time when it is sought to be 
marked as an exhibit. These objections should be taken at 
earliest.  Once document has been tendered and marked as 
an exhibit, belated objection as to the mode of proof is 
discouraged by the Courts. The prudence behind the same is 
avoiding any disadvantage to the party that has produced 
such documents but without adopting regular mode and this 
document, if otherwise is not liable to be rejected and 
irrelevant to the issue, is just discarded for not complying 
with the procedure that too having passed the stage to cure 
this mistake, can cause miscarriage of justice. However, 
when objection is taken at appropriate time, it would have

enabled the party, tendering the document, to cure defect and 
resort to such mode of proof as would be required. In “Mst. 
Akhtar Sultana Versus Major Retd. Muzaffar Khan Malik 
through his legal heirs and Others”3 the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan explained the same as follows:-  
“12. What is important to note is that, as a 
general 
principle, 
an 
objection 
as 
to 
inadmissibility of a document can be raised at 
any stage of the case7, even if it had not been 
taken when the document was tendered in 
evidence. However, the objection as to the 
mode of proving contents of a document or its 
execution is to be taken, when a particular 
mode is adopted by the party at the evidence-
recording stage during trial. The latter kind of 
objection cannot be allowed to be raised, for 
the first time, at any subsequent stage8. This 
principle is based on the rule of fair play. As if 
the objection regarding the mode of proof 
adopted has been taken at the appropriate 
stage, it would have enabled the party 
tendering the evidence to cure the defect and 
resort to other mode of proof. The omission to 
object at the appropriate stage becomes fatal 
because, by his failure, the party entitled to 
object allows the party tendering the evidence 
to act on assumption that he has no objection 
about the mode of proof adopted.”

In “Gulzar Hussain Versus Abdur Rehman and 
another”4, a five members bench of Honourable Supreme 
Court of Pakistan adopted the view that the respondents 
were not entitled to raise objection as to the proof of this

document since they had not raised such objection at the 
time of document was exhibited on record. It will also be 
beneficial to reproduce paragraph No. 13 of the said 
judgment:- 
 
“13. Coming now to the facts of this 
case the document in question was apparently 
a certified copy of the Revenue Record which 
was produced in the trial Court on an express 
permission obtained by the appellant. It is no 
doubt true that the respondents objected to the 
application of the appellant to produce further 
evidence after having closed his evidence 
earlier. But the Court allowed the request of 
the appellant and permitted him to adduce 
additional evidence consisting of documents 
including Exh. P.4. There is nothing on the 
record to indicate as to whether the 
respondents objected to the mode of proof in 
respect of this document at this stage. 
Objecting to a further opportunity being 
provided to the plaintiff to produce additional 
evidence is quite different from objecting to the 
admissibility of the document on the ground of 
mode of proof, It was argued on behalf of the 
respondents that there was no order of the 
Court that the document be exhibited. We are, 
however, unable to verify the correctness of 
this statement from the present record. 
However, there is on record the statement of 
the Advocate producing these documents and 
an exhibit number has been assigned to the 
document in question. In the judgments of the 
Courts below also the document has been 
referred to as Exh. P.4 - and there is nothing 
on the record to indicate as to whether the 
respondents raised this objection that the 
document was not exhibited by the Court, at 
any earlier stage. The rule of law laid down by 
this Court, therefore, was fully attracted in this

case and the respondents are debarred from 
raising the question of the formal proof of this 
document at subsequent stage.” 
      (Underlining is mine)  
8.  
 
In “Gopal Das and another Versus Sri 
Thakurji and Others”5 the Privy Council held that where the 
objection is not that the document is in itself inadmissible 
but that the mode of proof is irregular or insufficient it is 
essential that the objection should be taken at the trial before 
the document is marked as an exhibit and admitted to the 
record. It was further observed that strict formal proof might 
or might not have been forthcoming had it been insisted on 
at the trial. The objection taken at the appellate stage as to 
the formal proof was repelled, in the following manners:- 
 
“……..The endorsement means that the 
document is admitted in evidence as proved. 
Where the objection to be taken is not that the 
document is in itself inadmissible but that the 
mode of proof put forward is irregular or 
insufficient it is essential that the objection 
should be taken at the trial before the 
document is marked as an exhibit and admitted 
to the record. A party cannot lie by until the 
case comes before a Court of appeal and then 
complain for the first time of the mode of 
proof. A strictly formal proof might or might 
not have been forthcoming had it been insisted 
on at the trial. In the present instance, it does 
not appear that the objection was taken at the 
proper time or that it would have been of any 
avail had it been taken...”

The failure to take objection as to the 
inadmissibility in evidence of document as opposed to the 
mode of proof, however, is not fatal. The above rule of fair 
play is also reflected in “P.B. Gajendragadkar, C.J., K.N. 
Wanchoo, M.Hidayatullah, Versus Ramaswami and P. 
Satyanarayana Raju, JJ.”6 as well as “R.V.E. Venkatachala 
Gounder Vs Arulmigu Viswesaraswami & V.P. Temple”7. 
Paragraph No. 20 of the “R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder” 
case (supra) is repeatedly cited and relied in various cases 
including “Dayamathi Bai (SMT) Versus K.M. Shaffi”8and 
“State of Gujarat Versus Ashokkumar Lavjiram Joshi”9. The 
paragraph reads:- 
 
“The learned counsel for the defendant-
respondent has relied on The Roman Catholic 
Mission Vs. The State of Madras & Anr.AIR 
1966 SC 1457 in support of his submission that 
a document not admissible in evidence, though 
brought on record, has to be excluded from 
consideration. We do not have any dispute with 
the proposition of law so laid down in the 
abovesaid case. However, the present one is a 
case which calls for the correct position of law 
being made precise. Ordinarily an objection to 
the admissibility of evidence should be taken 
when it is tendered and not subsequently. The 
objections as to admissibility of documents in 
evidence may be classified into two classes:- 
(i) an objection that the document which is 
sought to be proved is itself inadmissible in 
evidence; and (ii) where the objection does not

dispute the admissibility of the document in 
evidence but is directed towards the mode of 
proof alleging the same to be irregular or 
insufficient. In the first case, merely because a 
document has been marked as 'an exhibit', an 
objection as to its admissibility is not excluded 
and is available to be raised even at a later 
stage or even in appeal or revision. In the 
latter case, the objection should be taken 
before the evidence is tendered and once the 
document has been admitted in evidence and 
marked as an exhibit, the objection that it 
should not have been admitted in evidence or 
that the mode adopted for proving the 
document is irregular cannot be allowed to be 
raised at any stage subsequent to the marking 
of the document as an exhibit. The later 
proposition is a rule of fair play. The crucial 
test is whether an objection, if taken at the 
appropriate point of time, would have enabled 
the party tendering the evidence to cure the 
defect and resort to such mode of proof as 
would be regular. The omission to object 
becomes fatal because by his failure the party 
entitled to object allows the party tendering 
the evidence to act on an assumption that the 
opposite party is not serious about the mode 
of proof. On the other hand, a prompt 
objection does not prejudice the party 
tendering the evidence, for two reasons: 
firstly, it enables the Court to apply its mind 
and pronounce its decision on the question of 
admissibility then and there; and secondly, in 
the event of finding of the Court on the mode 
of proof sought to be adopted going against 
the 
party 
tendering 
the 
evidence, 
the 
opportunity of seeking indulgence of the 
Court for permitting a regular mode or 
method of proof and thereby removing the 
objection raised by the opposite party, is 
available to the party leading the evidence. 
Such practice and procedure is fair to both

the parties. Out of the two types of objections, 
referred to hereinabove, in the later case, 
failure to raise a prompt and timely objection 
amounts to waiver of the necessity for insisting 
on formal proof of a document, the document 
itself which is sought to be proved being 
admissible in evidence. In the first case, 
acquiescence would be no bar to raising the 
objection in superior Court.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
10.  
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan, in the recent 
past, has repeatedly observed that receiving of any 
document, in without oath statements of learned advocates 
and then marking them as exhibits, deprives the opponent 
party from their right to cross-examine as to the documents 
in question10. The documents which are marked as exhibits 
during without oath statement of the learned advocates who 
otherwise have no concern with such documents and the 
same are kept on record in violation of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984 (the „QSO‟), after the suitable or permissible 
stage of trial / case till the litigants can take step to cure the 
defect, can result into possibility to prejudice the interest of 
the parties to the suit.  
11. 
 
The learned counsel for the petitioner has also 
relied upon “Malik Riazullah” case (supra). He stated that 
the learned Islamabad High Court has already observed that

no provision to de-exhibit is available in the Code and orders 
to de-exhibit are alien to the Code, thus, the legislature has 
not envisaged removing of documents from the record. It is 
concluded by the learned Islamabad High Court that since 
marking of a document as an exhibit does not debar the other 
party from objecting admissibility at later stage, it is, 
therefore, axiomatic that admitting a document in evidence 
does not determine its evidentiary value nor does its 
admissibility attain finality. Paragraph No. 12 of this 
judgment reads as under:- 
 
“12.  The learned counsel for the 
Petitioner has laid great stress on Rule 3 of 
Order XIII of the C.P.C. in support of his 
contention that the learned trial Court is vested 
with the power to de-exhibit documents or, in 
other words, have them altogether removed 
from the record after they have been received 
in evidence and marked as exhibits. Such 
documents may become part of the record 
though the question of their evidentiary value 
remains open to challenge. The expression 'de 
exhibit' is not defined nor mentioned in the 
C.P.C. The above discussed provisions refer to 
the expressions 'receive' or 'produce'. Rule 3 of 
Order XIII, refers to the rejection of irrelevant 
or inadmissible documents. The scheme of the 
above mentioned provisions and the legislative 
intent does not envisage the removing of 
documents from the record after they have 
been received or allowed to be produced and 
thereafter marked as 'exhibits' except under 
Rule 9 of Order XIII. There is no provision in 
the C.P.C. for removing a document from the 
record which has been marked as an 'exhibit'. 
De exhibiting or removing from the record of 
the trial Court is alien to the provisions of the 

 
Writ Petition No. 10608 of 2024       (Judgment) 
Writ Petition No. 10609 of 2024 
Writ Petition No. 10611 of 2024 
 
 
 
13 
C.P.C. As already noted, merely receiving a 
document and making it part of the record 
does not give finality to its evidentiary value 
and, therefore, by no stretch of imagination 
does it prejudice the right to a fair trial. The 
provisions of the C.P.C. are tools for ensuring 
a fair trial. If documents were allowed to be de 
exhibited then, despite not causing prejudice to 
the other party, it would be used for delaying 
adjudication of the suit. This definitely would 
have provided an opportunity to delay the 
proceedings besides the exercise being futile. 
Rejection of documents under Rule 3 Order 
XIII of C.P.C. is before receiving or marking 
them as exhibits. The expression 'de exhibit' or 
power vested in the trial Court in this regard 
would be reading in the C.P.C. something not 
provided therein by the legislature.” 
  
Almost same view was later adopted by this Court in 
“Muhammad Arif and Others” case (supra).  
12.  
 
Here I would like to advert to some orders, in 
the present case, passed by the learned trial Court. On 
21.06.2023, statement of the learned counsel for the 
petitioner was recorded in which the documents were 
allocated numbers (Ex.PA-1 to Ex.PA-29). This statement 
was stamped and signed by the learned Court. It is observed 
that part of the record where this statement of the learned 
counsel for the petitioner is recorded does not reflect that the 
same was recorded in the presence of the learned counsel for 
the respondents. The learned revisional Court has also 
gathered from the proceedings that when the statement of the 
learned counsel for petitioner was recorded and documents 
were marked as exhibits, the other side was not present.

Nevertheless on 27.06.2023, without causing 
material delay and prior to further progress in the suit, an 
application to de-exhibit the above referred documents was 
filed by the respondents. After contest on this application, 
the learned trial Court passed the following order:-

13.  
 
Noticeably, the above orders have been passed 
without proper application of judicial mind and with no 
deliberation as to the discussed law. Examination of 
judgments on the subject reveals that permitting documents 
to be brought on record / marking them as exhibits, through 
without oath statements of learned advocates, can cause 
damage to the interest of litigants. It is the duty of the Courts 
to adhere to the above settled law. In “Muhammad Akram 
and another Versus Mst. Farida Bibi and Others”11 the 
Supreme Court observed that the Court is duty bound to look 
into the document produced on record. It is also a settled 
law that even if no objection was taken by the other side 
when the document was exhibited the Court has not 
prevented from adjudicating its nature, where it is valid or 
not, or where it is fake or not. The above duty as well as the 
law settled by the learned Islamabad High Court in “Malik 
Riazullah” case (supra) and this Court in “Muhammad Arif 
and Others” case (supra) has been ignored. 
14.  
 
The learned revisional Court though noticed 
that the learned trial Court acted in purely mechanical 
manners but without looking into the record and appreciating 
stage of the case proceeded to uphold the decision of the 
learned trial Court. The trial is in progress in consequence of 
the application under section 12(2) of the Code, wherein ex-
parte judgment and decree dated 20.04.2016 is sought to be

brought on record (as Ex.PA-1 to Ex.PA-29), were also 
relied by respondents No. 2 and 3 in their suit and when they 
obtained the ex-parte judgment. Besides other documents 
(Ex.PA-9 to Ex.PA-12), the death certificates issued on 
29.07.2015 was produced by the respondents to secure the 
ex-parte judgment and decree. Ex.PA-13 to Ex.PA-17 were 
also brought on record by the respondent-side in their suit. 
There are some other documents that have been ordered to 
be de-exhibited, which are part of the judicial file of the 
main suit. It looks that respondent-party relied on such 
documents as well.  
15. 
 
It is the claim of the petitioner in her 
application under section 12(2) of the Code that ex-parte 
judgment and decree is passed on the basis of bogus death 
certificates. It is also claimed that Mst. Nusrat daughter of 
Ferozdin was reflected as defendant No. 8 in the main suit 
(instituted in the year 2014), whereas, Mst. Nusrat passed 
away in the year 2012. The process of adducing evidence of 
the defendants of application under section 12(2) of the 
Code (present respondents) has not yet started. In “Khurshid 
Ali and 6 Others Versus Shah Nazar”12 it is observed that 
Courts are not only to sit and watch as to who commits a 
mistake and who does not commit a mistake, from amongst 
the litigants and one who commits a mistake should be 
deprived of the right claimed. I would like to reproduce the 
following paragraph of the said judgment:-

“It is incorrect to think now under an 
Islamic dispensation that the Courts are only 
to sit and watch as to who commits a mistake 
and who does not commit a mistake, from 
amongst the contesting litigants, and one who 
commits a mistake in procedural matters 
should be deprived of the right claimed; even if 
he is entitled to it. This Court has not approved 
of such like practice. (See Muhammad Azam v. 
Muhammad Iqbal PLD 1984 SC 95). In this 
case even if the application had not been 
pressed “so called”; if it was necessary for 
just decision of the case, as held by the High 
Court (to summon the material relied upon by 
the appellants side), it should have been 
summoned and treated as evidence in the 
matter without any formalities. And mere 
failure to exhibit a document formally would 
not make any difference.” 
16.  
 
Prejudice must not be caused to the litigants 
because of any mistake of the Courts though the litigants 
and their learned counsel are also required to be vigilant. 
The order-sheet of the learned trial Court and the 
observation of the learned revisional Court regarding the 
presence of learned counsel for the respondent, at the time 
when the documents were marked as exhibits, are also at 
variance. Order dated 21.06.2023 reflects that this order 
was passed in the presence of all the parties. Learned 
counsel for the respondents stated that his attendance is 
incorrectly marked as evident from part of the record where 
the statement producing documents is recorded. The learned 
revisional Court, as already discussed above, has gathered 
from the circumstances of the case that the respondent side 
was not present when the documents were marked as

exhibits. Nevertheless, it is clear from the record that the 
respondents have raised objection before any further step in 
the progress of the case. Orders to exhibit and then to de-
exhibit have been passed not merely ignoring the Code and 
the QSO but at the same time the repeated observation of 
the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan as well as this 
Court in various cases including “Rustam and Others”, 
“Mst. Akhtar Sultana” and  “Manzoor Hussain (deceased) 
through L.Rs.” (supra) clearly disapproving the trend of 
permitting the learned advocates to exhibit the documents, 
in their without oath statements, has been overlooked. It 
will not be out of place to once again observe that these 
judgments contain clear guidelines for the learned Courts 
below as to the proper procedure and practice required to be 
adopted in course of trial vis-à-vis bringing the documents 
on record. Ignoring them by the litigants or by the learned 
Courts is not just resulting into unnecessary delays but at 
the same time it can cause miscarriage of justice. 
 17. 
 
The orders to exhibit and then to de-exhibit the 
documents have been passed in haste, which is also ignored 
by the learned revisional Court. As already discussed in 
detail that the trial in pursuance to the application under 
section 12(2) of the Code is still at the stage when the 
mistake can be cured. In case titled “Jodhpur Gums & 
Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. Versus Punjab National Bank and 
Ors”13 the mistake was allowed to be cured by recalling the

relevant witness(s). In case titled “N.M.S. Sadasivier 
Krishnier and Others Versus T.S. Meenakshi Iyer and 
Others”14  it is held that it is wrong to commence judgment 
before completing the matters of admitting documents, 
unless the exceptional circumstances do exist. Considering 
the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the 
view that the learned revisional Court should have proceeded 
to exercise its jurisdiction to avoid the clear possibility of 
miscarriage of justice or likely prejudice to the interest of the 
parties, by giving opportunity to cure mistake instead of 
simply upholding the orders of the learned trial Court.   
18.  
In view of the above discussions, orders of the 
learned trial Court marking the aforesaid documents as 
exhibits through without oath statement of learned advocate 
and then order to de-exhibit them as well as judgment dated 
29.01.2024 are set-aside. The petitioner can file a suitable 
application to produce further evidence / documents or re-
examination of any witness. The learned trial Court to give 
chance to the respondent-side to cross-examine as to 
additional evidence, if produce. The learned trial Court shall 
not allow any undue adjournment to produce witness or 
documents and this process is expected to be completed 
within forty five working days from the receipt of this 
judgment. Any undue adjournment or hindrance in the 
progress of the case, by either side, shall carry the 
consequence as provided in law.
