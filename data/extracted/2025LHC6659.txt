JUDGMENT 
Date of Hearing  
13.11.2025 
Applicant by: 
M/s Mujeeb-ur-Rehman Kiyani and Raja 
Ammar Jilani, Advocates.  
Respondent No.1 by: 
M/s Khurram Masood Kiyani and Syed 
Wajid Hussain Kazmi, Advocates. 
Respondents No.2 to 5 by: 
Proforma.  
 
MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This revision application in 
terms of Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) 
(hereinafter referred to as “C.P.C.”) calls for scrutiny of 
concurrent findings of the two courts whereby suit for 
declaration, possession and injunction, instituted by the applicant 
was dismissed.  
2. 
Facts, in brief, necessary forming background of this 
revision application are that a suit for declaration, cancellation of 
mutation No.9960 dated 28th February, 2001, separate possession 
and injunction was instituted by respondent No.1 (hereinafter 
referred to as “respondent”) against the applicant and others 
with the averment that she is owner in possession of the property 
forming part of Khasras No.663, 664,756,1304,1391,1395,1797 
and 1893, situated in revenue estate of Lakhan Dehati, District 
Rawalpindi on the basis of oral gift. It is asserted that gift

mutation No.9960 dated 28th of February, 2001, sanctioned in 
favour of the applicant is the product of fraud and be declared as 
null and void, having no legal effect upon her rights. The suit was 
contested by the applicant, being defendant. The applicant then 
instituted a suit for declaration, possession and injunction 
claiming therein that he is owner of house measuring 01-kanal, 
forming part of Khasras No.1893/1304, situated in revenue estate 
of Lakhan Dehati, District Rawalpindi, which was gifted to him 
by his mother Taj Begum through mutation No.9960 dated 28th 
of February, 2001 and the respondent has no right, title or 
interest whatsoever in the the suit house. It appears that in 
response to the latter suit, the respondent did not submit her 
written statement and her right of defence was struck off by way 
of order dated 30th of July, 2012. Both the suits were, however, 
consolidated and multiple issues were framed. After framing of 
issues, both the sides adduced their evidence, on completion of 
which, suits of both the sides were dismissed as regards their 
ownership, however, gift mutation No.9960 dated 28th of 
February, 2001 was annulled and revenue officer was directed to 
pass mutation of inheritance of deceased mother of the applicant 
and respondent namely Mst. Taj Begum, in favour of all the legal 
heirs, as per their shares.  The applicant, however, being 
aggrieved, preferred an appeal before learned Additional District 
Judge, Rawalpindi but it was dismissed by way of judgment and 
decree dated 16th of February, 2021; hence this revision application.  
3. 
During the proceedings, learned counsel for the 
respondent raised an objection that the revision application is 
barred by time in the light of law laid down in the case ASAD ALI 
and 9 others v. The BANK OF PUNJAB and others (PLD 2020 Supreme 
Court 736), in pursuance of which applicant moved an application, 
i.e., C.M. No.722-C of 2023 seeking condonation of delay.

4. 
In this background, it would be apt to first address the 
preliminary objection, raised by the learned counsel for the 
respondent. 
5. 
After having heard the learned counsel for the parties, it 
transpires that initially revision application was presented to the 
office on 6th May, 2021, well within time to which effect parties 
are even not at variance and on its presentation, the office raised 
multiple objections. As per the office report, the case file was 
received back by the learned counsel on 26th of May, 2021 so as 
to remove the office objections but it was refiled on 16th June, 
2021 without removal of office objections. The office, thus, again 
repeated the objections on 25th of June, 2021 under diary No.9179 
of 2021. The file was again received back by the learned counsel 
for the applicant on 12th of October, 2021, which was refiled after 
partial removal of the office objections on 15th of October, 2021 
through diary No.15091 of 2021. The objections were again 
repeated on 25th of October, 2021 and the case file was received 
by the learned counsel for the applicant and it was refiled after 
complete removal of the objections on 27th of October, 2021, 
whereafter number was allocated to the revision application. 
6. 
In order to properly comprehend the matter in issue, it 
would be advantageous to have a glimpse of Volume-V,  
Chapter-1 of the Rules and Orders of the Lahore High Court, 
Lahore (hereinafter referred to as “Rules”). Part-A relates to the 
proceedings in the High Court and deals with the judicial business 
relating to the presentation and reception of appeals, revisions, 
applications for review and other petitions. Rules 9 and 9-A of 
the Rules are directly related to the issue at hand, which are 
reproduced below for ready reference and convenience:- 
 
9. 
Power to return petition for amendment – (i) The 
Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is authorized to return 

 
 
Civil Revision No.609-D of 2021 
 
 
 
 
-4- 
 
memorandum of any suit, appeal, or petition, or 
application, etc. 
a) 
if it is not maintainable under any law; or 
b) 
if it is not properly constituted; or 
c) 
if it contains scandalous or objectionable 
language or material; or 
d) 
if it is not drawn up in conformity with the 
foregoing directions; or 
e) 
for amendment, making up of the deficiency 
or for filing requisite documents, within the 
time to be specified in the Objection 
Memorandum Appendix I(a), I(b) & I(c). 
(ii)  
The order of the Deputy Registrar (Judicial) 
returning the memorandum of any suit, appeal, petition or 
application may be challenged before the Chief Justice or 
Judge nominated by the Chief Justice on administrative side 
whose decision shall be final and shall not be assailed in any 
other proceeding before the High Court.  
9-A.  
Display of the List. – A list of petitions, appeals, etc., 
ordered to be returned shall be notified on the Notice Board 
and petitions, appeals, etc., not received back within seven 
days of the publication of the list shall be placed before a 
Judge of the High Court for orders on a date to be notified 
by including such petition in a motion cause list. It is made 
clear that any delay in placing such petition before the 
Court or issuing the list shall not furnish any justification for 
non-receipt of the returned petition in time and non-
compliance of the objection taken within time specified by 
Deputy Registrar (Judicial). 
 
It is manifestly clear from the above that in terms of Rule 9 
of the Rules, the Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court is 
authorized to return a memorandum of any suit, appeal, or 
petition, or application including revision application in case it is 
suffering from any deficiency in terms of clauses ‘a to e’ of the 
Rule 9 of the Rules. Such an order can be assailed before the 
Chief Justice or a Judge nominated by the Chief Justice on 
administrative side for the said purpose, whose decision shall be 
final and shall not be challenged in any other proceeding before 

 
 
Civil Revision No.609-D of 2021

the High Court. In exercise of such powers, the Deputy Registrar 
(Judicial) raised objections, for the rectification of which, the file 
was received back, but the objections were not rectified within 
the allocated period. It is an admitted position that the objections 
were removed after availing multiple opportunities by the 
applicant and file was finally presented on 27th of October, 2021 
to the office and it was thus accordingly assigned number. The 
emphasis of learned counsel for the applicant, however, is that 
even if the file was not refiled within the time prescribed by the 
office, it cannot be adjudged as time barred unless due 
compliance is made to Rule 9-A of the Rules. In support whereof, 
he has made reference to the cases of FARMAN ALI vs. MUHAMMAD 
ISHAQ and others (PLD 2013 Supreme Court 392), CHIEF EXECUTIVE, 
PESCO DEPARTMENT, GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA, 
PESHAWAR and others vs. AFNAN KHAN and others (2021 SCMR 2100) and 
ROBINA KAUSAR vs. MUHAMMAD LATIF (2025 CLC 911), to which 
effect, it is observed that in all the referred cases, facts were bit 
different as compared to the case at hand and as such, same are 
not attracted in the present case. 
7. 
The proposition crept up before this Court is quite similar 
to the case of ASAD ALI supra wherein a larger Bench of Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, while distinguishing the fact of the case of 
Farman Ali supra, held as under:- 
25. 
While going through Sabran Bi's case, we notice 
that distinction has been drawn between a situation 
where after raising of objections by the-office the 
petitioner does not receive back the file and a situation 
where the petitioner receives back the file. The cases 
cited in which the petitioner had received back the file 
after raising of objections by the office and had not 
returned the same within the time allocated by the office 
and which were therefore held to be time-barred, were 
held to be distinguishable from cases where the file had 

 
 
Civil Revision No.609-D of 2021 
 
 
 
 
-6- 
 
not been received back. It was held that where the file 
had not been received back would not be held to be time-
barred and such cases should be fixed before the court 
for appropriate Orders for non-prosecution or any order 
in terms of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code. 
It is also instructive to note that the LDA judgment which 
as aforesaid was of three learned Judges of this Court was 
distinguished on the ground that it pertained to a 
situation where the file had been taken back by the 
Counsel, meaning thereby that in the instant case where 
the file had been taken back, even according to Sabiran 
Bi ibid, the matter had to be decided in terms of the LDA 
case ibid, which holds that failure to remove the 
objections within the time fixed (where the file had been 
received back) renders the appeal to be time-barred if in 
the time period between the raising of objections and 
removal thereof the period of limitation expires. 
 
In other words, when upon raising the objections by the 
office, a party himself receives back the case file, there remains 
no need to proceed in terms of Rule 9-A of the Rules. Rule 9-A 
ibid would only come into play when, after the objections are 
raised by the office, it is ordered that file be returned to the party 
concerned but such party did not turn up to receive the file, office 
is obliged to notify such objections on the notice board, and if, 
despite such notice, the file is not received back within seven days 
of the publication of the list, the matter shall be placed before a 
Judge of the High Court for orders and a date to be notified by 
including such case file in a motion cause list. The contentions of 
learned counsel for the applicant, on the strength of Rule 9-A of 
the Rules are, thus, misdirected and ill-founded. The revision 
application, as a result, is barred by time, and, as such, the 
application, i.e., C.M. No.722-C of 2023 is hereby dismissed.  
8. 
Learned counsel for the applicant, however, persisted that 
even if a revision application is barred by time, it is the duty of 

 
 
Civil Revision No.609-D of 2021 
 
 
 
 
-7- 
 
the Revisional Court to examine the record so as to adjudge that 
any of the subordinate courts have not committed illegality or 
material irregularity as contemplated in Section 115 of the C.P.C.  
9. 
For advancement of ends of justice, I examined the record. 
10. 
The suit property was originally owned by Mst. Begum Jan, 
on whose demise, her legacy devolved upon her legal heirs 
including Mst. Taj Begum (mother of the applicant and 
respondent) through inheritance mutation No.9649 dated 26th of 
July, 2000. As per claim of the applicant, his mother gifted the 
suit property to him through mutation No. 9960 dated 28th of 
February, 2001 (Exh:P1). Being aggrieved, the respondent not 
only challenged the said mutation but also asserted that the suit 
property was in fact orally gifted to her by her grandmother  
Mst. Begum Jan during her life time. She, however, failed to 
prove her claim with regard to ownership on the basis of oral gift.  
The applicant since has relied upon gift mutation, so being 
beneficiary, he was obliged to first narrate the actual transaction 
of gift which resulted into sanctioning of the impugned mutation. 
From the examination of the pleadings, it is quite obvious that the 
original transaction with regard to gift has nowhere been even 
pleaded. It is well established principle of law that whenever 
person(s) claim(s) title under gift orally or in writing, he/they 
has/have to independently plead the transaction of gift. Perusal of 
the plaint of the suit, filed by the applicant reveals that no date, 
time, place and names of witnesses in whose presence gift was 
made, were mentioned in plaint.  
11. 
Needless to observe that for a valid gift there are three basic 
ingredients; offer by the donor(s), acceptance by the donee(s) of 
such offer and delivery of possession of the property subject 
matter of gift to the donee(s). From perusal of the statement of 
Muhammad Usman (DW-1), it is crystal clear that he also did not 

 
 
Civil Revision No.609-D of 2021 
 
 
 
 
-8- 
 
state about the original transaction of gift. He did not utter even 
a single word concerning the transaction of gift. From the 
available evidence it is crystal clear that the applicant has 
remained unable to prove that the gift mutation was effected in a 
transparent manner. Reliance in this respect can be placed on 
BILAL HUSSAIN SHAH and another versus DILAWAR SHAH (PLD 2018 
Supreme Court 698), and RAB NAWAZ and others versus GHULAM 
RASUL (2014 SCMR 1181). Needless to mention that applicant, 
being the beneficiary of the gift mutation, was obliged to produce 
cogent and confidence inspiring evidence but an iota of evidence 
was not produced by him to prove the genuineness and validity 
of gift mutation. It is also an established fact on the record that 
the applicant is not in possession of the suit property which is a 
sine qua non for a valid gift. Reliance to this effect can be placed 
on HAYAT (DECEASED through L.Rs vs. Mst. FATEH 
KHATOON (2023 MLD 665).  
12. 
It is trite law that mutation(s) by itself does/do not confer 
any right or title upon the person(s) claiming benefit therein. 
Once a mutation is challenged, the party that relies on such 
mutation(s) is/are bound to revert to the original transaction(s) 
and to prove such original transaction(s) which resulted into the 
entry or attestation of such mutation(s) in dispute. This oft 
repeated principle of law is quite logical because a mutation not 
being a title deed, is merely an evidence of some original 
transaction between the parties that had been struck somewhere 
prior to entry of a mutation. Reliance can safely be placed on the 
cases of MUHAMMAD IQBAL and another versus MUKHTAR AHMAD 
through L.Rs. (2008 SCMR 855) and MUHAMMAD AKRAM and another 
versus ALTAF AHMAD (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 688).  
13. 
There is yet another important aspect, the applicant has 
though relied upon the gift mutation but he did not enter into the 
witness box and instead examined his special attorney namely 

 
 
Civil Revision No.609-D of 2021 
 
 
 
 
-9- 
 
Muhammad Usman as DW-1, without any just and sufficient 
cause of his absence. There is no cavil that a party cannot be 
bound down to appear in the witness box in all eventualities and 
evidence can be led through any duly appointed attorney but a 
party failing to enter into the witness box, is obliged to explain 
reasons for his non-appearance. In absence of any lawful 
justification, a negative presumption in terms of Article 129(g) 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 can be gathered against 
such party. Guidance in this respect can be sought from Mrs. 
ZAKIA HUSSAIN and another versus Syed FAROOQ HUSSAIN (PLD 
2020 Supreme Court 401). The above principles have been 
reiterated by this Court in the case of ANJUMAN-E-ISLAMIA, 
SIALKOT through Khawaja Mahmood Ahmad, President, Anjuman-e-
Islamia, Sialkot versus Haji MUHAMMAD YOUNAS and 3 others (PLD 
1997 Lahore 153). 
14. 
 There are concurrent findings of facts recorded by two 
courts which are, apparently, founded on proper appraisal of 
evidence. Scope of revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 of 
C.P.C. is quite limited where both the lower courts are 
unanimous in forming their view. This Court, being revisional 
court, cannot substitute the concurrent findings of the two courts 
of competent jurisdiction merely on the ground that from the 
perusal of evidence, some other view is possible. The exercise of 
revisional powers is always guided by the necessary 
pre-conditions laid down in the above referred provision of law. 
The scanning of evidence and the perusal of impugned judgments 
do not reflect any illegality or material irregularity, justifying 
interference by this Court. Reference in this respect can be made 
to GHULAM QADIR and others versus Sh. ABDUL WADOOD and others 
(PLD 2016 Supreme Court 712), Mst. ZARSHEDA versus NOBAT KHAN 
(PLD 2022 Supreme Court 21) and MUHAMMAD SARWAR and others 
versus HASHMAL KHAN and others (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 13).

In the wake of above discussion, instant revision 
application having no merits is dismissed with no order as to 
costs.
