Through

Constitutional Petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner assailed the 
vires of order dated 05.03.2022 whereby the learned Appellate Court 
while accepting the appeal of respondents No.2 to 4, set-aside the 
order dated 28.09.2021 and directed the learned Executing Court to 
proceed further in accordance with law to satisfy the decree.  
2. 
Shorn of unnecessary details, respondents No.2 to 4 instituted 
a suit for recovery of maintenance allowance and dowry articles 
against the respondents No.5 & 6 on 20.11.2014; that suit was 
resisted by respondents No.5 & 6 through filing contesting written 
statement; that after failure of pre-trial reconciliation proceedings 
interim maintenance was fixed; that respondents No.5 & 6 failed to 
pay the interim maintenance allowance as well as cross-examine the 
plaintiffs’ witnesses, hence, ex-parte proceedings were conducted 
vide order dated 25.04.2015 and learned Trial Court after recording 
ex-parte evidence decreed the suit vide judgment & decree dated 
29.06.2015 and declared that respondent No.2/plaintiff No.1 is

from institution of the suit till subsistence of marriage, the 
respondents No.3 & 4 were declared entitled to recover maintenance 
allowance @ Rs.2,000/- per month from the institution of suit till 
their legal entitlement and also decreed alternate price of dowry 
articles as Rs.2,00,000/-; that respondents No.2 to 4 filed an 
execution petition for the satisfaction of the said decree on 
24.07.2015; that respondents No.5 & 6 failed to appear before the 
Court despite issuance of notices, therefore, non-bailable warrants of 
arrest were issued against them and in the light of said warrants 
respondent No.5 was arrested and produced before the Court on 
03.11.2015; that said judgment debtor (respondent No.5) moved an 
application for setting aside the ex-parte judgment and decree 
coupled with an application for suspension of said decree on 
18.11.2015; that learned counsel for the decree-holders made a no 
objection statement qua suspension of ex-parte judgment and decree 
and release of judgment-debtor subject to furnishing surety bond in 
the sum of Rs.400,000/- with one local surety; that the learned 
executing Court subject to submission of surety bond  in the sum of 
Rs.400,000/- with one local surety in the like amount to the 
satisfaction of the Court suspended the judgment and decree dated 
29.06.2015 and released the judgment-debtor vide order dated 
28.11.2015; that petitioner stood surety of said respondent No.5 to 
the tune of Rs.4,00,000/- and in this regard he submitted surety bond 
on 03.12.2015; that respondent No.6 (husband of respondent No.2) 
was also arrested and sent to civil prison for one year on 12.11.2019;

the effect that if the judgment debtor failed to pay the decree then he 
being the surety would be responsible to satisfy the decree and in 
case of default he will have no objection upon the auction of his 
property; that he also submitted an affidavit on 11.11.2019 by 

W.P. No.5215 of 2022.

maintaining that he has paid Rs.50,000/- today and will deposit 
further amount of Rs.50,000/- on 12.11.2019 and undertakes that he 
will be bound to pay the remaining decretal amount; that respondent 
No.5/judgment debtor moved an application for his release which 
was allowed by the learned Executing Court vide order dated 
22.12.2020 with the observation that the father is bound to pay the 
maintenance allowance to his children and in case of his non-
payment the grandfather is liable to pay the same if he has sufficient 
resources to pay the same but there is nothing on record to show that 
he has sufficient means to pay the decretal amount and keeping in 
view his old age he was released from the jail; that respondents No.2 
to 4 assailed said order through preferring an appeal which was 
dismissed vide order dated 30.04.2021 by maintaining that as the 
surety (petitioner) got recorded his statement on 17.10.2017 that he 
will pay the decretal amount, therefore, for the satisfaction of 
remaining decretal amount of maintenance allowance the surety 
(petitioner) as well as his property is available; that the petitioner 
also moved an application on 17.11.2020 for his discharge being the 
surety of judgment debtor (respondent No.5) by maintaining that he 
has paid Rs.4,00,000/- for which he stood surety, therefore, he be 
discharged being the surety of the judgment debtor (respondent 
No.5). Learned Executing Court vide order dated 28.09.2021 
allowed his application by declaring that surety (petitioner) is not 
responsible to pay any other amount and discharged him from his 
liability. Feeling aggrieved, respondents No.2 to 4 assailed said order 
through preferring an appeal. The learned Appellate Court vide 
judgment/order dated 05.03.2022 allowed the appeal by declaring 
that in the light of petitioner’s statement dated 07.10.2017 and his 
affidavit dated 11.11.2019 he is responsible for remaining decretal 
amount and set aside the order dated 28.09.2021 with direction to the 
learned Trial Court to proceed further in accordance with law to 
satisfy the decree. Being dissatisfied, petitioner has filed this petition.  
3. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
perused the record with their able assistance.  

W.P. No.5215 of 2022.

4. 
It is matter of record that the learned Trial Court decreed the 
suit of the respondents No.2 to 4 for recovery of maintenance 
allowance and dowry articles in the following terms: 
“What has been discussed above, the plaintiff No.1 is entitled to 
receive maintenance allowance from the defendant @ Rs.2000/- 
per month from the institution of suit till the subsistence of 
marriage. While, the plaintiffs No.2 & 3 are also entitled to receive 
maintenance allowance @ Rs.2000/- per month from the 
institution of suit till they are legally entitled. The plaintiff No.1 is 
entitled to recover Rs.200,000/- as alternate price of dowry 
articles. Suit of the defendant for restitution of conjugal rights is 
dismissed.”  
 
 
Although, the suit was instituted against husband of 
respondent No.2 and father of respondents No.3 & 4 namely 
Muhammad Nadeem (respondent No.6) and his father namely 
Muhammad Nizam (respondent No.5) but the decree is silent 
whether said suit was decreed against both of them and they are 
bound to pay the decretal amount jointly and severely or the said 
decree is only against respondent No.6. 
5. 
It is evident from the record that respondent No.6 was sent to 
civil prison for a period of one year on 12.11.2019 and after facing 
the civil imprisonment he was released from the jail. It is also 
evident from the record that respondent No.5 was also arrested twice 
for satisfaction of the decree. First time he was released on 
submission of surety bond of the petitioner and secondly he was 
released by the Court keeping in view his old age by observing that 
he was not in easy circumstances to pay the decretal amount.  
 
In view of above, both the judgment debtors were discharged 
by the Court from paying the decretal amount.  
6. 
From perusal of order sheet it appears that in compliance of 
non-bailable warrants of arrest, respondent No.5 was arrested and 
produced before the Court on 03.11.2015; that he moved an 
application on 28.11.2015 for setting aside the ex-parte judgment 
and decree dated 29.06.2015 coupled with an application for 
suspension of said decree; that learned counsel for the respondents 
No.2 to 4 appeared before the Court and made a statement that he 
has no objection if the operation of impugned judgment and decree is 
suspended and judgment debtor Muhammad Nizam (respondent 

W.P. No.5215 of 2022. 
5
No.5) be released subject to submission of surety bond in the sum of 
Rs.400,000/- with one local surety in the like amount to the 
satisfaction of the Court. The learned executing Court in the light of 
his statement vide order dated 28.11.2015 suspended the operation of 
the impugned judgment and decree and directed to release the 
judgment debtor Muhammad Nizam if he submits surety bonds of 
Rs.400,000/- with one local surety in the like amount to the 
satisfaction of the Court. The petitioner came forward and stood as 
surety of said respondent No.5 and submitted his surety bond of 
Rs.4,00,000/- on 03.12.2015 in the light of order dated 28.11.2015. 
Perusal of the surety bond submitted by the petitioner reflects that 
petitioner stood surety with the following undertaking: 
"

In the light of said surety bond, learned Executing court on 
29.01.2016 passed the order in following terms.  
“As per record, the judgment debtor Nizam in application for 
setting aside decree has submitted his surety bond of 
Rs.4,00,000/- and he has been released from custody. Now to 
come up for payment of decretal amount on 09.02.2016.” 
 
In this way, it appears that the petitioner was only surety for 
Rs.4,00,000/- and he submitted the surety bond in the light of 
statement of learned counsel for the decree holders and the direction 
of learned executing Court. 
7.  
It is evident from the perusal of record that the application for 
setting aside of ex-parte judgment and decree dated 29.06.2015 of 
respondent No.5 was dismissed on 16.03.2016 and appeal against it 
also met the same fate and dismissed by the learned Appellate Court 
vide order dated 26.08.2016 and the writ petition (W.P. No.18033 of 
2016) against said orders was dismissed as withdrawn on 29.05.2017. 

W.P. No.5215 of 2022.

8. 
After dismissal of respondent No.5’s application for setting 
aside the ex-parte judgment and decree he was again arrested and 
sent to jail. He moved an application for his release from the jail and 
discharge him from the payment of decretal amount. The learned 
Executing Court while deciding his application for his release from 
the payment of the decree vide order dated 22.12.2020 observed as 
under: 
“It further reflects from perusal of record that earlier judgment 
debtor Muhammad Nizam was arrested and one Masood-ul-
Hassan stood surety for him and surety has paid Rs.4,00,000/- 
(four lac) for satisfaction of the decree. In the given 
circumstances, I am of the view that decree to the extent of dowry 
articles has been satisfied and further decree was partially 
satisfied decreed to the extent of maintenance is also satisfied. 
There is nothing on record to show that petitioner/judgment 
debtor Muhammad Nizam has sufficient resources to pay the 
decretal amount to the decree holder. Petitioner is an old-aged 
person, hence, it would not be appropriate to keep him in the civil 
prison. Hence, application of the petitioner is hereby accepted. 
Judgment debtor Muhammad Nizam is hereby released.”   
 
9. 
Said order was assailed by respondents No.2 to 4 and the 
learned Appellate Court dismissed their appeal vide judgment/order 
dated 30.04.2021 while observing as under: 
“Perusal of the record depicts that earlier respondent 
No.2/judgment debtor /Muhammad Nazim was arrested during 
the proceedings of execution petition and was released on 
submission of surety for him namely Masood-ul-Hassan for the 
satisfaction of decree. It is admitted thing that Rs.4,00,000/- has 
been paid for the partial satisfaction of decree. Now the question 
before the Court is that to what extent of the decretal amount 
respondent 
No.2/judgment 
debtor/Muhammad 
Nazim 
is 
responsible. In this regard, it is observed that appellant/decree 
holder filed a suit for maintenance allowance and dowry articles 
against the respondent No.1 Muhammad Nadeem and his 
father/respondent No.2/Muhammad Nazim and said suit was 
decreed vide judgment & decree dated 29.06.2015 to the extent of 
maintenance allowance of plaintiffs and dowry articles amounting 
to Rs.200,000/-. It is observed that the judgment and decree is not 
clear that it was also passed against the respondent 
No.2/Muhammad Nazim regarding maintenance allowance of 
plaintiffs while to the extent of decretal amount of dowry articles 
i.e. Rs.200,000/- has been paid. The respondent No.2/judgment 
debtor/Muhammad Nazim being grandfather of minor plaintiffs in 
the presence of father of minor plaintiffs respondent No.1, is not 
responsible to pay maintenance allowance of minors because it is 
primary responsibility of respondent No.1/judgment debtor being 
father to pay the maintenance allowance to his children and in 
case of non-payment of maintenance allowance, grandfather is 
duty bound to pay the maintenance allowance, if he has sufficient 
reasons to pay the same. But in this case, there is nothing on 

W.P. No.5215 of 2022. 
7
record to show that respondent No.2 has the easy circumstances 
to pay the maintenance allowance to his grandchildren.”   
 
 
Said judgment was not assailed any further, hence, the same 
has attained finality. Through said orders, the learned Courts below 
discharged respondent No.5 for the satisfaction of the decree.  
10. 
The petitioner failed to pay Rs.4,00,000/- of his surety, hence, 
his property was put to auction. In order to stop the auction 
proceedings, petitioner appeared before the Court and got recorded 
his statement on 07.10.2017 in the following manner: 
 "ایبن ایک ہک ںیم دقمہم ذہا ںیم اضنم
وین دم 
 وہں۔ دقمہم ذہا ںیم ومرہخ51۔54۔40

"وکیئ ارتعاض ہن وہاگ۔ 
In the light of his statement auction proceedings was stayed. 
11. 
The petitioner again defaulted to pay the decretal amount, 
therefore, his property was again put to auction, then he moved an 
application on 11.11.2019 by maintaining that he has already paid 
Rs.128,000/- and wants to pay further amount of Rs.50,000/- and 
prayed for stay of auction proceedings. In support of his application, 
he submitted his affidavit in the following terms: 
"ہی ہک حلف

"ہی ہک حلفا َ ایبن رکات وہں ہک لایق زرِ ڈرگی یھب ادا رکےن اک اپدنب روہں اگ۔ 
 
In the light of said submission, the learned Executing Court 
vide order dated 11.11.2019 stayed the auction proceedings and 
adjourned the matter to 12.11.2019. Petitioner submitted further 
amount of Rs.50,000/- on the given date.  
12. 
The learned appellate Court keeping in view the petitioner’s 
above referred statement dated 07.10.2017 and his affidavit dated 
11.11.2019 declared him liable to pay the whole decretal amount 
vide impugned order dated 05.03.2022. Whereas, perusal of the 
above referred statement and affidavit reflects that the petitioner bind 
himself to pay the decretal amount being the ‘surety’ and not given 
any fresh surety bond for the satisfaction of whole decree. 

W.P. No.5215 of 2022. 
8
Admittedly, the petitioner stood surety for Rs.4,00,000/- only and on 
07.10.2017 the outstanding decree was also not more than 
Rs.4,00,000/-.  
13. 
It is argued on behalf of the respondents No.2 to 4 that this 
Court also declared the petitioner is liable to pay the whole decretal 
amount while deciding Writ Petition No.11283 of 2019 titled 
“Masood ul Hassan V. Judge Family Court & others”. From the 
perusal of said order, it appears that the petitioner assailed the order 
dated 22.06.2019 of learned Executing Court whereby his property 
was put to auction. This Court while dismissing the said writ petition 
vide order dated 24.07.2019 observed as under: 
“Having considered the submissions made by the learned counsel 
it is observed that the writ petition is wholly misconceived and 
untenable. Undeniably a decree was passed by the Family Court, 
execution proceedings started for the enforcement of decree, the 
petitioner opted to furnish surety on behalf of the judgment-
debtor and that the judgment-debtor failed to discharge his 
liability under the decree. This being so, the learned Judge 
Family Court was legally justified to proceed against the surety 
who had committed and undertaken to satisfy the claim of decree-
holder in the event of default on the part of judgment debtor. 
Undeniably, the judgment-debtor had failed to pay off the entire 
decretal amount and was not willing to satisfy the decree 
completely in result; the learned Judge Family Court was legally 
justified to proceed against the surety. Even otherwise, having 
furnished the surety to pay off the liability of judgment-debtor, 
the petitioner could not be allowed to find fault with order or to 
extend lame excuses to save his skin. The order for filing of the 
schedule for auction of the property of the surety and for its 
auction, in the given circumstances, does not suffer from any 
error of law. The order being interlocutory, no appeal being 
competent, the learned Addl. District Judge rightly declined 
interference.” 
 
  
From the perusal of the above observation, it is clear that this 
Court only settled that in case of non-payment of decretal amount by 
the judgment debtor, the surety would responsible and in case of 
default on the part of surety, his property would be liable to be 
auctioned for the satisfaction of the decree. The only question before 
this Court was that whether the property of surety can be auctioned 
or not. A general observation was given by the Court and it was not 
decided to what extent the present petitioner/surety would be 
responsible, as this was not a fact in issue before the Court at that 
time.   

W.P. No.5215 of 2022.

14. 
From the perusal of the decree, it appears that no specific 
decree has been passed against respondent No.5. Said decree was 
consisting upon two parts i.e. a decree for recovery of maintenance 
allowance and a decree for recover of dowry articles. A decree for 
maintenance allowance also consisted upon two portions as it was 
passed in favour of respondent No.2/plaintiff No.1 wife of the 
respondent No.6 and in favour of respondents No.3 & 4 minors 
children of respondent No.6. Respondent No.5 is grandfather of the 
minors and he can be bound only to the extent of maintenance of the 
minors being their grandfather, if he has easy circumstances to pay 
the same. Therefore, when the Courts have let off/released 
respondent No.5 Muhammad Nizam from the responsibility of 
satisfying the decree, then how his surety is responsible to satisfy the 
same.  
15. 
A surety’s liability is co-extensive with that of the judgment 
debtor and he was as much bound by his undertaking as was the 
judgment debtor, and both were collectively and severely liable to 
make payment to the decree holder. While construing the tenure and 
extent of surety bond, the words and recitals of the surety bond must 
be taken into consideration to gather the intention of the executant of 
said bond and the bond must be strictly construed. A surety is liable 
only upto the extent to which he is clearly bound.  
16. 
Through the order dated 28.11.2015 the learned executing 
Court directed respondent No.5 to submit surety bond of 
Rs.400,000/- with one local surety in the like amount and in 
compliance of said order, the petitioner submitted surety bond of 
Rs.400,000/- on 03.12.2015 and vide order dated 29.01.2016 the 
learned executing Court on submission of surety bond of 
Rs.400,000/- released respondent No.5 which facts clearly 
established that the petitioner was stood surety only of Rs.400,000/-. 
Contract of surety had provided that maximum he was liable to the 
tune of Rs.400,000/-. Orders of learned executing Court did not find 
mentioned that the respondent No.5 would arrange a surety for the 
payment of the entire decretal amount. Petitioner stood surety 

W.P. No.5215 of 2022. 
10
amounting to Rs.400,000/- only, which he has paid before the 
learned Executing Court on different occasions as detailed in his 
application to discharge him from the liability as surety. Said fact 
was not denied by respondents No.2 to 4. In these circumstances, the 
petitioner has satisfied the amount for which he stood surety.  
17. 
For the foregoing reasons, learned Appellate Court has erred 
in law while allowing appeal of respondents No.2 to 4 and 
dismissing the application of the petitioner. Hence, by accepting this 
petition impugned order passed by the learned appellate Court dated 
05.03.2022 is set-aside and order dated 28.09.2021 passed by the 
learned Executing Court is restored.
