Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. This petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 stems out from 
judgment dated 22nd September, 2016, whereby the learned Additional 
District Judge, Rawalpindi, while allowing the revision petition filed by 
respondent No.3 (hereinafter referred to as “respondent”) set aside the 
order dated 6th February, 2016 passed by the learned Judge Family Court/ 
Executing Court, Rawalpindi. 
2.  
Facts in brief necessary for adjudication of instant petition are 
that the petitioner was married to the “respondent”. On account of 
differences, a suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula was 
instituted by the “respondent”, which was decreed by way of judgment 
dated 8th December, 2010, subject to return of dower. The petitioner moved 
an execution petition seeking return of dower. The execution petition was

though objected by the “respondent”, however, by way of order dated 6th 
February, 2016, the objection was turned down and the “respondent” was 
directed to hand over 4-tola gold in shape of ornaments or its price at the 
prevailing market rate. Feeling dissatisfied, the “respondent” filed a 
revision petition before the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, 
which was accepted through impugned judgment on the ground that 
execution petition was not competent, in the circumstances.  
 3.  
After having heard learned counsel for the parties at 
considerable length, I have perused the record. 
4.  
After having remained in marital tie for some time with the 
petitioner, the “respondent” in order to part her ways, instituted a suit for 
dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula before the learned Judge 
Family Court, Rawalpindi. On failure of pre-trial reconciliation 
proceedings, suit was finally decreed by way of order dated 8th December, 
2010 with the following observations: - 
“3. 
Considering pre-trial reconciliation proceedings to be 
failed under proviso of Section 10(4) of Family Court Act 1964, 
suit of the plaintiff for dissolution of marriage is hereby decreed 
on the basis of Khullah, subject to return of dower…” 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
5.  
This followed an execution petition on behalf of petitioner for 
the return of 4-tola of gold as part of dower. The “respondent” resisted the 
execution proceedings and by way of order dated 22nd November, 2011, 
she was directed to return the four tolas gold ornaments mentioned in 
Nikahnama or its price mentioned in the receipt at the time of Nikah. 
Feeling dissatisfied, the petitioner preferred revision petition before

the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, which was allowed by 
way of judgment dated 2nd April, 2012. The “respondent” then filed 
W.P.No.3002 of 2012, which was accepted with the consent of the parties 
by way of order dated 15th May, 2015 in the following manner: - 
“With the consensus of the parties, this petition is 
accepted and set aside the orders dated 25.11.2011 and 
02.04.2012 passed by the learned trial Court, with a direction to 
the learned Executing Court to decide the application of the 
respondent afresh keeping in view the law laid down by the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in titled “Mst. Ayesha 
Shaheen vs. Khalid Mehmood & another” (2013 SCMR 1049). 
6.  
In post remand proceedings, the learned Judge Family Court/ 
Executing Court, by way of order dated 6th February, 2016, directed the 
“respondent” to hand over 4-tola gold in shape of ornaments or its price at 
the prevailing market value while discarding her objections. This prompted 
the “respondent” to file the revision petition before the learned Additional 
District Judge, Rawalpindi, which was allowed through impugned 
judgment. 
7.  
It appears from the impugned judgment that the revision petition 
was accepted on the sole ground that for the recovery of “Zar-e-Khula” in a 
suit for dissolution of marriage, execution petition was not maintainable. 
Reliance to this effect was placed on Mst. NADIA BIBI v. ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT JUDGE and others (PLD 2013 Lahore 41). From the perusal 
of the judgment in the case of (Mst. Nadia Bibi) supra; it clearly reveals 
that in the said matter suit for dissolution of marriage was decreed and 
marriage was dissolved on the basis of Khula without any condition. In this 

4 
 
 
 
W.P.No.2827 of 2016 
 
 
 
backdrop, it was held that as there was no decree in favour of respondent 
No.2 in the petition, so execution proceedings are not maintainable.  
8.  
The facts in the present case on the contrary are altogether 
different. In this case, the learned Judge Family Court, while dissolving the 
marriage on the basis of Khula, directed the “respondent” to return the 
dower. As per column No.17 of Nikahnama, dower was in the shape of 4-
tola gold ornaments, which is even not in dispute. Learned counsel for the 
“respondent” though submitted that a suit for recovery was instituted by the 
petitioner to this effect, which was dismissed but from the perusal of record 
it reveals that suit for recovery was related to some other gold ornaments, 
having no nexus with the gold ornaments subject matter of the present 
controversy.   
9.  
 The term “decree” is nowhere defined in the Family Courts Act, 
1964. So for this purpose, recourse can be made to section 2 (2) of the 
Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908), which defines the decree as under: - 
"decree" means the formal expression of an adjudication which, 
so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively 
determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of 
the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either 
preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection 
of a plaint the determination of any question within section 144 
and an order under rules 60, 98, 99, 101 or 103 of Order XXI 
but shall not include --- 
(a)  
any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal 
from an order; or  
(b)  
any order of dismissal for default. 
After having a glimpse of the definition of decree, no doubt left that a 
decree means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as 
regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the 

5 
 
 
 
W.P.No.2827 of 2016 
 
 
 
parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and 
may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the 
rejection of a plaint the determination of any question within section 144 
and an order under rules 60, 98, 99, 101 or 103 of Order XXI but shall not 
include any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an 
order or any order of dismissal for default. Suit for dissolution of marriage 
was decreed in terms of section 10 (4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964. The 
decision was compound, which on the one hand dissolved the marriage 
interse parties and on the other dissolution was made subject to return of 
dower. 
10.  
Section 13 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 provides the manner 
of enforcement of decrees, which reads as under: - 
  
13.    Enforcement of decrees.– (1) The Family Court shall pass 
a decree in such form and in such manner as may be prescribed, and 
shall enter its particulars in the prescribed register. 
      (2)  If any money is paid or any property is delivered in the presence of the 
Family Court, in satisfaction of the decree, it shall enter the fact of 
payment [or] the delivery of property, as the case may be, in the aforesaid 
register. 
      (3)  Where a decree relates to the payment of money and 
the decretal amount is not paid within time specified by the Court [not 
exceeding thirty days], the same shall, if the Court so directs be 
recovered as arrears of land revenue, and on recovery shall be paid to 
the decree-holder. 
      (4)  The decree shall be executed by the Court, passing it or by such 
other Civil Court as the District Judge may, by special or general order, 
direct. 
      (5)  A Family Court may, if it so deems fit, direct that any money to be 
paid under a decree passed by it be paid in such installments as it deems fit. 
  
11.  
The manner and form of decree is provided in the West Pakistan 
Family Court Rules, 1965. Rules 16 and 17, for the said purpose, are more 
relevant, which are reproduced below: - 

6 
 
 
 
W.P.No.2827 of 2016 
 
 
 
16. In every suit, on passing the judgment, a decree shall be 
drawn up in Form I and shall be signed by the presiding Judge. The 
decree shall bear the seal of the Court.  
17. The Court shall maintain a register of decrees and orders in 
the form prescribed for decrees and orders under the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908. 
12.  
The above discussion thus leads to irresistible conclusion that 
the order dated 8th December, 2010 resulting into dissolution of marriage 
on the basis of Khula subject to return of dower, for all intent and purposes, 
was a decree under section 13 of the “Act, 1964” and was executable.  
13.  
The crux of above discussion is that the learned Additional 
District Judge has erred in law while allowing the revision petition. 
Resultantly, this petition is allowed. Impugned judgment dated 22nd 
September, 2016 is set aside being illegal and unlawful. No order as to 
costs.
