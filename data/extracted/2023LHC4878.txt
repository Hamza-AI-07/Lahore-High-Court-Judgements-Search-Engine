Rai Sarfraz Ahmad Kharal, Advocate for the 
petitioner.     
 
 
The petitioner has assailed the order dated 
13.05.2023 passed by the learned Senior Civil Judge 
(Family Division), Hafizabad whereby application of 
the petitioner seeking permission to produce additional 
evidence was dismissed as well as the judgment dated 
12.09.2023 passed by the learned Additional District 
Judge, Hafizabad whereby appeal there-against was 
also dismissed.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that 
the impugned decisions are against the law and facts 
and result of misapplication of law inasmuch the 
document sought to be produced is relevant and 
admissible in evidence. He maintains that the petitioner 
intends to adduce receipt of return of dowry articles but 
the same was not available to him at the time of 
recording of evidence.

Heard.  Available record perused.

Section 9(2) of the Family Courts Act, 1964 
(„Act‟) clearly provides that where a defendant relies 
upon a document in his possession or power, he shall 
produce it or copy thereof in the Court along with the 
written statement. Sub-section (4) of Section 9 ibid 
requires copies of the documents referred to in sub-
section (2) to be given to the plaintiff along with the 
written statement on the date fixed for that purpose.

W.P. No.65227 of 2023 
 
Although the word “shall” has been used in sub-
sections (2) & (4) of Section 9 of the Act, however, that 
does not make these provisions mandatory thereby 
rendering non-compliance thereof absolutely fatal so as 
to prevent a defendant from belatedly filing and 
producing in evidence any document that was not filed 
along with the written statement. This is primarily for 
the reason that no such penal consequences have been 
specified by the legislature in Section 9 of the Act. It 
thus remains discretionary for the Family Court to 
permit a defendant to file any document, deliver a copy 
thereof to the plaintiff that was not filed along with the 
written statement and produce the same in evidence in a 
suit. The question then arises what are the principles 
governing the exercise of such discretion by the Family 
Court?    
5. 
It is well settled that a purposive rather than 
literal approach to the interpretation is to be adopted 
while interpreting provisions of the Family Courts Act, 
1964, therefore, an interpretation which advances 
purpose of the Act is to be preferred over an 
interpretation which defeats its object.1 It cannot be lost 
sight of that a special forum of the Family Court has 
been created by the legislature for expeditious 
settlement and disposal of disputes relating to marriage 
and family affairs, as manifest from preamble of the 
Act. Section 12A of the Act has specified a period 
within which such cases have to be disposed of by a 
Family Court. It is a quasi-judicial forum which can 
draw and follow its own procedure provided such 
procedure  is  not  against  the  principles of fair hearing

6. 
Keeping in view the principle of purposive 
interpretation as also the aforementioned object of the 
Act, it is held that permission for belated filing and 
production of a document in evidence cannot be granted 
as a matter of routine. The discretion should be 
exercised by the Family Court through a speaking order 
keeping in view the facts and circumstances in each 
case. The relevant considerations for the Family Court 
in this regard include the stage of proceedings at which 
the permission is sought, reason furnished by a 
defendant that prevented him from filing and producing 
the document at the relevant time, nature of the 
document sought to be filed and produced (such as 
admissible per se or otherwise required to be proved),  
delay in conclusion of the proceedings likely to be 
occasioned by the permission and likelihood of any 
other prejudice to the plaintiff if the permission sought 
is granted.  
7. 
While declining request of the petitioner, the 
learned Appellate Court furnished the following 
reasons:- 
“……Perusal of record reveals that appellant has mentioned in 
his written statement that a copy of receipt of return of dowry 
articles is annexed with his written statement but no such receipt 
was annexed with his written statement and in this respect he 
himself has admitted during his cross examination that no such 
receipt was annexed by him with his written statement. In such 
state of affairs, it is clearly evident that respondent/plaintiff was 
totally unaware regarding this receipt till the time of filing of 
application for production of additional evidence by the 
appellant and by filing this petition, the appellant has 
surprisingly introduced a new fact after recording of complete 
evidence of the respondent/plaintiff and his oral evidence. 
Moreover, he has also not placed reliance upon such receipt in 
his list of reliance. Now at this belated stage when suit is going 
to be finally concluded appellant filed application for additional 
evidence while introducing a new story regarding receipt of 
dowry articles as such the same cannot be allowed. 
Furthermore, perusal of said receipt prima-facie shows that 
neither the appellant/defendant nor the respondent/plaintiff are

  (2014 SCMR 1365); Muhammad Asim and others v. Mst. Samro Begum and others

  Muzaffargarh and another (2006 SCMR 100)

W.P. No.65227 of 2023 
 
the signatories of that receipt, therefore, being a private 
document, appellant/defendant cannot be allowed legally to 
tender this document in his evidence. under the circumstances, it 
seems that appellant has filed this application to fulfil the lacuna 
as was left by him. This act of appellant to fulfil the lacuna 
cannot be appreciated and allowed at this belated stage being 
prejudiced to the interest of opposite party/respondent. This 
court is afraid that contention of the appellant is based upon 
some conjectural hypothesis and is farfetched cry……”  
 
8. 
It is abundantly clear that permission to produce 
additional evidence in this case has been denied to the 
petitioner for having been made at the fag end of 
proceedings in the suit after recording of evidence by 
the parties and that too to adduce a private document 
which is not admissible per se. No valid reason 
preventing the petitioner from filing and producing the 
document sought to be tendered in evidence at the 
relevant time has been advanced and it has been rightly 
found to be an attempt to fill in lacuna after evidence of 
the parties has been recorded. The permission sought, if 
granted, would not only cause serious prejudice to the 
case of the respondent-plaintiff but also defeat the 
object of the Act i.e. expeditious disposal of the dispute. 
Therefore, the exercise of discretion on part of the 
Courts below in this case is clearly not arbitrary, 
capricious or whimsical but manifestly based on valid 
reasons which do not warrant interference by this 
Court.   
9. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner could not point 
out any illegality or jurisdictional error in the orders 
impugned. 
10. 
For the foregoing reasons, this writ petition, 
being devoid of any merit, is dismissed in limine.
