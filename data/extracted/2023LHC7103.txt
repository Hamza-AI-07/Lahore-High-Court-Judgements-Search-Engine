Government of Punjab through

Date of hearing 
16.05.2023. 
Petitioner by 
Mr. Amir Manzoor Awan, Advocate. 
Respondents by: 
Mr. Mushtaq Ahmed Chohan, Assistant 
Advocate General.   
 
 
SADIQ MAHMUD KHURRAM, J:-Through 
this petition filed  under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner has assailed 
the order dated 10.05.2023, passed by the Deputy 
Commissioner, Rajanpur, respondent No.4, whereby Zeeshan 
Sami son of Sami Ullah was ordered to be arrested and 
detained for a period of thirty days with immediate effect. It 
was further ordered that the custody of Zeeshan Sami son of 
Sami Ullah, shall be placed under the superintendence of the 
Superintendent, District  Jail, Rajanpur.  
2. 
 
In compliance of the order dated 12.05.2023, the 
learned Assistant Advocate General , Punjab on behalf of the 
respondent No.4, Deputy Commissioner, Rajanpur has filed 
his report and parawise comments.  
3. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that 
the order passed by Deputy Commissioner, Rajanpur 

W.P No. 6977 of 2023 
 
2 
 
 
respondent No.4, under section 3 sub-section (1)  of the 
Punjab Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960 is 
against the facts and law; that no material existed to justify the 
detention of Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah, in the 
circumstances existing; that there was no sufficient cause 
available with the respondent No.4, Deputy Commissioner, 
Rajanpur, to pass the said order; that it is not   necessary   to   
file   representation   before   Home Secretary, Government of 
the Punjab, Lahore as declared by  this  Court  in several  
judgments. It has been, thus, ultimately prayed that by 
allowing the writ petition, the impugned order of the Deputy 
Commissioner, Rajanpur (respondent No.4) dated 10.05.2023  
may be declared as illegal, unlawful, void-ab-initio and 
Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah, be set free immediately.  
4. 
 
On the other hand, the learned Assistant Advocate 
General has vehemently argued that petition in hand is not 
maintainable as Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah has remedy 
to file representation under section 3 sub section (6) of the 
Punjab Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance 1960 and that 
the order passed by respondent No.4, Deputy Commissioner, 
Rajanpur, is valid and passed on cogent material. He has 
further contended  that  the  writ petition  is  incompetent  as  
the  remedy  provided  of filing representation  before  the 
Govt. under  sub-section (6)  of section 3 of  Punjab 
Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance 1960 has not been 
availed by Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah, therefore, 
petitioner not having invoked the said remedy could not have 
filed the instant writ petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.  
Further  maintained  that  the powers under Article 199  of  the  
Constitution  of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 of this 
Court can  be  invoked when  other  alternate remedies are not 
available to the aggrieved person but in this case, as stated 
above,   the   alternate   remedy   is   available   to   the 

W.P No. 6977 of 2023 
 
3 
 
 
petitioner ;    that    it    is   the  constitutional    duty    of the 
Provincial Administration to keep the law and order situation 
peaceful. 
5. 
 
I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, 
the learned Assistant Advocate General and perused the record 
with their able assistance. 
6. 
 
In order to understand the legal aspect of the case it 
would be beneficial to reproduce section 3 of Punjab 
Maintenance Public Order Ordinance, 1960:- 
“Section 3 of the Punjab maintenance Public Order 
Ordinance 1960 
 Power to arrest and detain suspected person.---(1) Government, 
if satisfied that with a view to preventing any person from acting 
in any manner prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of 
public order, it is necessary so to do, may, by an order in writing, 
direct the arrest and detention in such period as may be specified 
in the order, and Government, if satisfied that for the aforesaid 
reasons it is necessary so to do, may subject to the other 
provisions of this section, extend from time to time the period of 
such detention  (for a period not exceeding six months at a time) 
(Explanation I)----For the purpose of this section ___ 
(i)Dealing in the black-market or hoarding as defined in the 
Hoarding and Black Market Order, 1948; or 
(ii)an act of smuggling punishable under the Sea Customs Act, 
1878, or the land Customs Act, 1924, or under any other law for 
the time being in force; or 
(iii)an act which is an offence under the Drugs Act 1976 (XXXI 
of 1976). 
Shall be deemed to be an act prejudicial to the maintenance of 
public order. 
(Explanation II)---Whoever is or was a member of an association 
or its Executive Committee, which association is or has been 
declared to be unlawful under any law for the time being in force 
in the Province, at any time during the period of seven days 
immediately before it was so declared to be unlawful shall be 
deemed to be a thing in a manner prejudicial to public safety and 
the maintenance of public order for the purposes of this section. 
(2) If a District Coordination Officer or a public servant 
authorized in his behalf by the Government has reasons to believe 
that a person, within his territorial jurisdiction has acted, is acting 
or is about to act in manner which is prejudicial to public safety 
or maintenance of public order, he shall immediately refer the 
matter to the Government. 

W.P No. 6977 of 2023 
 
4 
 
 
(3) (a) An order of arrest under subsection (1) may be addressed 
to a Police Officer or any other person and such officer or person 
shall have the power to arrest the person mentioned in the order 
and in doing so he may use such force as may be necessary. The 
Police Officer or the other person, as the case may be, shall 
commit the arrested person to such custody as may be prescribed 
under section (7). 
(b) A Police Officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector, if 
satisfied on receipt of credible information that a person against 
whom an order of arrest or of arrest and detention has been made 
under this section is present within such officer’s jurisdiction, 
may arrest him without a warrant in the same manner as he would 
have done if such order of arrest had been addressed to him “and 
thereupon commit the arrested person to such custody as may be 
prescribed under subsection (7); or if he receives any requisition 
in this behalf from the police officer or other person to whom the 
warrant, of arrest for the person arrested is addressed, make over 
the custody of the arrested person to such police officer or other 
person.” 
 
The Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty 
saved in accordance with law. Liberty of any citizen is an 
“inalienable right” of the citizen enshrined in article 4 and 
embodied in article 9 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and the detention of any citizen 
would tantamount the violation of fundamental rights 
guaranteed under articles 2-A, 3,4,9,14 & 18 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Even 
otherwise, the preamble of Punjab Maintenance Public Order 
Ordinance, 1960 law is made to ease public and ensure public 
safety, public interest and maintenance of public order and the 
applicability of the provisions of a public maintenance order is 
subject to guarantee provided by the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. I also do not agree with 
the learned Law Officer that prior to filing the writ petition 
against the order of detention, it is necessary to assail the order 
passed under section 3 of the Punjab Maintenance Public 
Order Ordinance, 1960 before the Additional Chief Secretary 
(Home), Government of Punjab, Home Department, Lahore. 
Reliance is placed on “Abdul Latif Shamshad Ahmad vs. 

W.P No. 6977 of 2023 
 
5 
 
 
District Magistrate, Kasur (1999 P.Cr.L.J 2014) in which by 
tackling such legal observation the Hon’ble Bench observed as 
under:- 
“At the very outset I would express that before the filing of this 
writ petition, the making of the representation or preference of 
appeal before the Secretary Home Department, Government of 
the Punjab is not necessary. It has been held In Maulna Shah 
Ahmad Noorani v. Government of the Punjab PLD 1984 Lah. 
222 and Azad Papers (Jasarat) v. Province of Sindh and others 
PLD 1974 Kar. 81 that availability of alternate remedy of 
making representation to the Provincial Government against the 
impugned order does not oust and eclipse the jurisdiction of the 
Constitutional Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction in a 
matter of the instant nature.This objection of the learned 
Assistant Advocate General is overruled.” 
Reliance is also placed on the cases of “Mst. Sana Jamil Vs 
Government of  the  Punjab  through  Secretary  and  5  
others” (2016  P.Cr.L.J  424) and “Syed Mubbashar Raza Vs   
Government   of   Punjab   through   Secretary   Home 
Department and 2 others” (PLD 2015 Lahore 20). Keeping 
in view the law laid down in judgment supra the objection of 
the learned AAG is overruled. 
7. 
 
Now coming up to the merits of the instant case; 
Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah cannot be detained merely on 
the grounds that he is an active member of a political party. In 
the report filed by respondent No.4, Deputy Commissioner, 
Rajanpur, it has been mentioned that Zeeshan Sami son of 
Sami Ullah is involved in planning civil disturbance, however, 
the current involvement of Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah  
in any registered case, has not been mentioned. The 
respondent No.4, Deputy Commissioner, Rajanpur, in the 
impugned order has only observed that for the fact that 
Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah is an active member of a 
political party and he in this manner is planning to participate 
in protests, therefore, he needs to be detained. The right to 
protest is also implied in "the right to assemble peacefully", in 
the "right to form associations or unions", in the "right to form 
or be a member of a political party" and in the "in the right to 

W.P No. 6977 of 2023 
 
6 
 
 
freedom of speech and expression". The august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in the SUO MOTU CASE NO.7 OF 2017 (P L D 
2019 Supreme Court 318 ), has held as under:- 
 “25.  The Constitution does not specifically stipulate a right 
to protest. However, democracy recognizes such a right, and 
it was through democratic means that Pakistan was 
achieved. The people of the subcontinent acquired 
independence from British-colonial rule by the efforts of the 
All India Muslim League and the Indian National Congress; 
they peacefully protested, demonstrated, held meetings and 
expressed themselves through elections, as a consequence 
of which two independent countries, Pakistan and India, 
emerged. Our Constitution is moored in democracy. The 
people of Pakistan have declared, "that Pakistan would be a 
democratic State" and that its citizens are, "dedicated to the 
preservation of democracy". Citizens have the right to 
peacefully protest and hold demonstrations, and may do so 
against any action or decision of a government or authority. 
The right to protest is also implied in "the right to assemble 
peacefully", in the "right to form associations or unions", in 
the "right to form or be a member of a political party" and 
in the "in the right to freedom of speech and expression" 
Political parties are institutions of very great importance under 
our form of government. They are, in fact, the effective 
instrumentalities by which the will of the people may be made 
vocal, and the enactment of laws in accordance therewith 
made possible. So potent have they become in determining the 
measures and in administering the affairs of government that 
they are now regarded as inseparable from, if not essential to, 
a republican form of government. The people have an inherent 
right to form, organize, and operate political parties and to 
reorganize an old political party. This is included in the right 
of suffrage. It has been characterised as "an inalienable right 
guaranteed by the Constitution."  The august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan  in the case of WORKERS' PARTY PAKISTAN 
through Akhtar Hussain, Advocate, General Secretary and 6 

W.P No. 6977 of 2023 
 
7 
 
 
others Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and 2 others (P 
L D 2012 Supreme Court 681) has held as under:- 
“The freedom of association, as enunciated by Article 17 of 
the Constitution, confers a Fundamental right on every 
individual to partake in the political governance of the State, 
whilst concurrently reinforcing the constitutional mandate 
to protect and advance this right through a democratic State. 
Furthermore, the 'freedom of assembly' (Article 16) and 
'freedom of speech' (Article 19) also serve to realize this 
constitutional imperative.” 
While declaring the  Anti-Terrorism (Second Amendment) 
Ordinance (XIII of 1999) in so far as inserting section 7 A into 
the Anti--Terrorism Act, 1997, invalid ,being repugnant to the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 by 
including illegal strikes, go slows, lock outs as "civil 
commotion" and providing punishment for the same as it 
militated against the Fundamental Right of freedom of 
expression provided in Article 19 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and as being also  
inconsistent with the labour laws of the country which ensured 
the  observance of various Fundamental Rights, the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “JAMATI ISLAMI 
PAKISTAN through Syed Munawar Hassan,Secretary General 
versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary, 
Law,Justice and Parliamentary Affairs(P L D 2000 Supreme 
Court 111 ) held as under :-. 
“It is difficult to give an exhaustive definition of the 
term "internal disturbances". It may be understood in 
the context of run down of the law and order 
situation in the country. Disturbances resulting in 
loss of life and property, disturbances resulting from 
large scale clashes between various factions of the 
people, or where a Government finds it difficult to 
maintain law and order, to run the ordinary 
administration of the country, to keep open 
educational institutions and to ensure normal 
economic activity and functioning of the various 
State institutions could be termed as internal 

W.P No. 6977 of 2023

disturbance, depending upon the language in a 
statute. It is essential to define in clear an definite 
terms as to what constitutes an act of civil 
commotion 
in 
unambiguous 
words 
without 
derogation to the rights of the citizens to the 
enjoyment of rights guaranteed under Article 4 
(rights of individuals to be dealt with in accordance 
with law). Article 9 (security of person), Article 14 
(inviolability of dignity of man), Article 16 (freedom 
of assembly) and Article 27 (equality of citizens) and 
Article 19 (freedom of speech and expression) and 
there shall be freedom of the press, subject to any 
reasonable restriction imposed by law in the 4 
interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security 
or defence of Pakistan w or any part thereof, friendly 
relations with foreign States, public order, decency or 
morality, or in relation to contempt of Court, 
commission of or incitement to an offence. 
  
17. We are not persuaded to accept that the terms 
"illegal strike", "lockout" and "go-slow" are to be 
read in the context of Labour Laws, as argued by the 
learned Deputy Attorney-General. The learned 
Attorney-General was right in arguing that the above 
words are to be read ejusdem generis with the word 
"internal disturbances". However, the difficulty is 
that the words "internal disturbances" used in section 
7-A are vague. The term "internal disturbance" may 
have various meaning depending upon the context in 
which it is used. The words "internal disturbance" 
and "civil commotion" connote temporary outbreak 
of unlawful violence, whereby the ordinary business 
of. the community is, more or less, interrupted and it 
has the effect of uprising among the masses which 
occasion a serious and prolonged disturbance and, 
insurrection. Civil disorder not attaining the situation 
of war or an armed insurrection, is a wild and 
irregular action with many persons assembled 
together. "Internal disturbance" is a disturbance 
occurring in any part of the country which 
wrongfully interferes with the general tranquillity in 
social and ordinary life of the people under the 
Constitution and the law. The meaning of the term 
"internal disturbances", "illegal strike", lock-out" and 
"go-slow" must be expressed in definite terms for the 
purposes of section 7-A of the Act, in that, it would 
not be in the interest of justice to leave it to a Police 
Officer to apply the law which is vague and 
unintelligible. 
Constitutional 
guarantee 
of 
the 
Fundamental Right to have a fair trial is spelt out 
from Article 9 of the Constitution. An accused is not 
only entitled to pre-trial disclosure by the prosecution 
to the defence of relevant material specially the 

W.P No. 6977 of 2023 
 
9 
 
 
statement of witnesses under section 161, Cr.P.C. but 
also pre-commission disclosure of the offence before 
being tried. It is the duty of the State to disclose in 
the law as to what constitutes an offence. Viewed 
from that angle section 7-A of the impugned Act to 
the extent indicated above is unconstitutional, in that, 
it infringes the presumption of innocence and does 
not meet the condition of reasonableness due to 
vagueness. Every citizen has a constitutional right to 
lead his life in accordance with law and what is not 
prohibited by law, The vague definition of the words 
"internal disturbances", "illegal strike" "lock-out" and 
"go slow", if allowed to continue in the statute in 
their present form, could lead to imbalance in 
individual and community rights. 
  
18. We, therefore, hold that section 7-A of the 
impugned Act to the extent indicated above is invalid 
being repugnant to the Constitution and requires to 
be suitably amended” 
 
 No material is available on record to justify that Zeeshan 
Sami son of Sami Ullah, created any disturbance in 
maintaining the law and order situation in the vicinity. Deputy 
Commissioner, Rajanpur, respondent No.4, while passing the 
said order has not referred any such material for justifying the 
detention of Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah. The august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has clearly laid down guideline in 
the case titled “Mrs. Arshad Ali Khan VS Government   of   the   
Punjab   through   Secretary   Home (1994 SCMR 1532) in 
the following unequivocal terms: - 
 “The word ‘public order’ is accordingly referable   to   public   
order   of local   significance   as   distinguished   from national  
up heavals  such  as  revolution,  civil strife and war.  Equally it 
is distinguishable from  the  popular  concept  of  law  and  
order and  of  security  of  State.    Law  and  order represents 
the largest circle, within which is the next circle representing 
public order and the smallest circle represents security of the 
State.    Hence an  activity  which  affects  law and  order  may  
not  necessarily  affect  public order    and    an    activity    
which    may    be prejudicial    to    public    order    may    not 
necessarily affect security of the State. 
From  the  above-stated  legal  position, it is quite clear 
that before an act is held to be  prejudicial  to  public  order, it  
may  be shown  that  the  act  or  activity  is  likely  to affect  the  
public-at-large.    As  a  corollary, therefore,   it   follows   that   
an   act   which concerns only to an individual and does not 
amount   to   an   activity prejudicial   to   the public   peace   

W.P No. 6977 of 2023 
 
10 
 
 
and   tranquility   cannot   fall within   the ambit of   section   3   
of   the Ordinance.” 
Furthermore, the detention of Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah  
is violative of the principle of fair trial as enshrined in article 
10 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973.   Moreover, as mentioned above, even the Apex Court 
of the country does not consider being associated with a 
political party as a valid ground to deprive a citizen from 
benefit which law provides in his favour and the liberty of any 
person cannot be curtailed on this ground.  In  the  instant case, 
the liberty  of  Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah has been 
curtailed  merely  on the  ground  of  his association with a 
political party otherwise  there  is  no  other  apprehension to  
integrity,  security  or  disturbance  of  public or  any  part  
thereof,  external  affairs  of  public,  public  order  or 
maintenance   of   supply   or   services at the hands of  
Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah. It is also a fact that presently 
the call for protest by the political party to which Zeeshan 
Sami son of Sami Ullah belongs has also been withdrawn.  
Presently there do not exist any grounds to continue detaining 
Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah. 
 
8. 
 
In  view  of  the  above  detailed  discussion,  there  
is  no evidence  collected  by  the  concerned  authority  due  to  
which detention of Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah under 
section 3 of the Punjab Maintenance Public Order Ordinance, 
1960 can be said as justified and there is no justifiable reasons 
available for detention, therefore,  the impugned order dated 
10.05.2023  passed by respondent No.4, namely, Deputy 
Commissioner, Rajanpur,  is  set  aside  and  declared  as    
illegal,  without  any  lawful justification  and  ineffective  
upon  the  rights  of  Zeeshan Sami son of Sami Ullah. 
Consequently, the instant petition is allowed. Zeeshan Sami 

W.P No. 6977 of 2023 
 
11 
 
 
son of Sami Ullah, is directed to be released forthwith if not 
required in any other case and set at liberty.
