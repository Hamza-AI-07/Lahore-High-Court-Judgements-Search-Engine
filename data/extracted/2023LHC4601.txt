with section 491, Cr.P.C. the petitioner has supplicated 
for the recovery of her real sons namely Muhammad 
Saleem and Ali Raza, from the illegal and unlawful 
custody of respondents No.2 and 3.  
2. 
In compliance with this Court’s Order dated                  
07-09-2023, Nusrat, SHO, Muhammad Shabbir, SI of 
Police Station Musafir Khana, District Bahawalpur have 
entered appearance, whereas learned Law Officer has 
also submitted report on behalf of  SHO of the police 
station Musafir Khana, according to which, Muhammad 
Saleem and Ali Raza, alleged detenus were arrested in

P.P.C. registered at Police Station Musafir Khana, 
District Bahawalpur and their physical remand has been 
obtained from the court of learned Civil Judge Ist 
Class/Magistrate Section 30, Bahawalpur.  
The instant petition was filed on 06-09-2023 and 
came up for hearing before this Court on 07-09-2023 in 
early hours of the day as an urgent case whereas after

WP No. 6566 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
has been shown on 07-09-2023 at 11:00 a.m. vide Rapat 
No.10.  
After going through the F.I.R No. 434 of 2023, 
Police Station Musafir Khana, it manifests that 
Muhammad Farooq, complainant has only nominated Ali 
Raza, detenu as the sole perpetrator and no other person 
was shown as an accused in the F.I.R. However, vide 
case diary No.2 dated 27-08-2023, supplementary 
statements 
of 
Muhammad 
Farooq, 
complainant, 
Muhammad Waseem and Muhammad Ibrar, PWs have 
been recorded by Muhammad Shabbir, SI/Investigating 
Officer wherein the above mentioned PWs have stated 
that due to the anxiety Muhammad Farooq, complainant 
had forgotten to nominate Muhammad Saleem son of 
Abdul Hameed in his application for registration of crime 
report, who was present in a sugarcane crop near the 
place of occurrence with common intention, who fled 
away from the place of occurrence when people attracted 
at the spot.  
3. 
This Court is of the view that the above-mentioned 
supplementary statements have been recorded only to 
justify the illegal confinement of Muhammad Saleem 
detenu. Moreover, from op-cit supplementary statements 
no offence is made out against Muhammad Saleem, 
detenu. It is normal practice of the police that after the 
arrest of accused persons they are produced before the 
Court of Area Magistrate on the following day but in the 
instant case on the same day of arrest i.e. 07-09-2023 
both the detenus were produced before the court of       
Mr. Zulfiqar Ali, learned Magistrate Section 30, 
Bahawalpur and while passing the order on the 
application for the grant of physical remand, learned 

3 
WP No. 6566 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
Magistrate has not applied its judicial and sagacious 
mind. 
 This Court while dealing with an identical matter 
has already issued following directions in case titled as 
Qari Muhammad Atta Ullah vs. District Police Officer Sialkot 
and another” (PLD 2022 Lahore 224). Relevant portion of 
the supra mentioned judgment is reproduced as under”- 
“…14.  To curb down the illegal practice of police 
officials qua the arrest and production of accused 
before learned Area Magistrate, the Court would 
like to issue following directions:- 
i) Whenever, a person is arrested in any 
case, his arrest be incorporated forthwith in 
computerized as well as manual roznamcha 
with date and time;  
ii) Similarly, when an accused is taken out 
from the police station for any purpose, a 
rapat should be written in this regard, vice 
versa on his return this practice should be 
adopted;  
iii) To make the process of entry in 
roznamcha transparent, it is ordered that 
entries in manual roznamcha (register No. 2) 
be made through ball-point. 
 iv) More so, when the accused will be 
produced before the learned Area Magistrate 
for the physical or judicial remand, date and 
time of arrest must has been mentioned in 
the application for obtaining remand and in 
case of failure, learned Area Magistrate 
should refuse to entertain request of remand. 
 v) Police file/ case diaries should be 
retained at police station as provided in Rule 
25.55 (3) of Police Rules, 1934 and 
whenever the investigating officer will 
proceed along with police file of case from 
police 
station 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
investigation or any other purpose that facts 
should be incorporated in the roznamcha 
(register No. 2) and on return the same 
practice be also adopted, other than this, 
police file must be retained at police station.  
      Any defiance of supra mentioned directions, 
would amount to contempt of court and delinquent 
official/officers will also be proceedable under 
section 155-C of Police Order, 2002…” 

4 
WP No. 6566 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
It is evident that the Investigating Officer as well 
as learned Magistrate have not followed the above-
mentioned directions.  
4. 
Another aspect of this case, which cannot be lost 
sight off is that manual Roznamcha has been written 
through led pencil not by ballpoint while ignoring the 
clear direction of this Court in Qari Muhammad Atta 
Ullah’s case ibid.  
5. 
Similarly, case diaries in this case have been 
written on loose printer papers having different colours. 
It 
is 
noteworthy 
that 
case 
diary 
No.2 
dated                     
27-08-2023 and supplementary statements of the PWs in 
the same date were subsequently maneuvered because 
papers of case diary No.2 have different colour than all 
other case diaries.  
6. 
I deem it appropriate that before issuance of 
directions in this case, the relevant law with respect to 
case diary shall be gone through. Rules 25.53, 25.54 and 
25.55 of Police Rules, 1934 are significant, which are 
hereby reproduced as infra:- 
25.53. Case diaries. - (1) Section 172(i), Code of Criminal 
Procedure requires that a case diary shall be maintained and 
submitted daily during an investigation by the investigating 
officer. In such diary shall be recorded, concisely and 
clearly, the steps taken by the police, the circumstances 
ascertained through the investigation and the other 
information required by Section 172(i), Code of Criminal 
Procedure. 
(2) Case diaries shall be as brief as possible; shall not be 
swollen with lengthy explanations and theories, and shall 
be written either in English or in simple Urdu.  
such incidents of the investigation shall be included 
as have a bearing on the case.  
(3) Detailed lists of stolen property, or of property seized in 
the course of a search, shall be entered in the first case 
diary submitted after the facts relating to such property 
were reported to, or discovered by, the investigating 
officer.  

5 
WP No. 6566 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
(4) The fact that copies of the record prepared under the 
provisions of section 165 or 166, Code of Criminal 
Procedure, have been sent to the nearest Magistrate 
empowered to take cognizance of the offence shall also be 
noted. 
25.54. Record of case diaries.- (1) Case diaries shall 
ordinarily be submitted in Form 25.54(1) and each sheet 
shall be numbered and stamped with the station stamp. Two 
or more copies, as may be ordered, shall be made by the 
carbon copying process by the officer conducting the  
investigation. The officer writing a case diary shall enter in 
such diary a list of the statements, recorded under section 
161, Criminal Procedure Code, which are attached to such 
diary and the number of pages of which each such 
statement consists.  
(2) They shall be sent from the scene of investigation to the 
police station without delay.  
(3) On arrival at the police station the number and date of 
each case diary shall be recorded on the reverse of the 
police station copy of the first information report, and the 
date and hour of receipt shall be entered on each copy of 
the diary.  
(4) The original shall be dispatched with as little delay as 
possible to the inspector or other superior officer as may be 
or copies,  Orders for the disposal and record of case diaries 
space provided in the form on both the original and the 
copy or copies.  Orders for the disposal and record of case 
diaries in the headquarters office are contained in Rule 
11.70. Also see Rule 27.38. 
(5) A copy of every case diary shall be retained at the 
police station, a separate file being maintained for each 
case. Such files shall be destroyed in accordance with the 
periods fixed in sub-rule 27.39(5). 
(6) Copies of all orders received at a police station in 
connection with case diaries and the replies thereto shall be 
made on blank sheets of paper and shall be attached to the 
case diary to which they refer. 
 25.55. Files of case diaries. - (1) When a case is sent for 
trial the police station file of case diaries shall be forwarded 
with the chalan to the magistrate, and on completion of the 
trial shall be returned to the police station for record. 
 (2) Such files when received back at the police station also 
files of other cases in which the final report has been 
submitted, shall be filed at the police station in an annual 
bundle A in accordance with the serial number of their first 
information report.  
(3) Copies of case diaries in pending cases shall be kept in 
files at the police station in a separate bundle B in 
accordance with the numbers of their first information 
reports.  

6 
WP No. 6566 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
(4) A list shall be kept in each bundle A and B of all the 
files contained therein, merely quoting the numbers of their 
first information reports. Should it be necessary to remove 
a file from the bundle the fact will be noted in the list. 
More so, section 172 is also relevant in this case, 
which is described below:- 
 
Sec. 172 of Criminal Procedure Code.. Diary of 
proceedings in investigation.—(1) Every police officer 
making an investigation under this Chapter shall day by 
day enter his proceedings in the investigation in a diary, 
setting forth the time at which the information reached him 
the time at which he began and closed his investigation, the 
place or places visited by him, and a statement of the 
circumstances ascertained through his investigation.  
 
(2) 
An Criminal Court may send for the police-diaries 
of a case under inquiry or trial in such court, and may use 
such diaries, not as evidence in the case, but to aid it in 
such inquiry or trial. Neither the accused nor his agents 
shall be entitled to call for such diaries, nor shall he or they 
be entitled to see them merely because they are referred to 
by the Court, but, if they are used by the police-officer who 
made them to refresh his memory or if the Court, uses them 
for the purpose of contradicting such police-officer, the 
provisions of the Evidence Act, 1872 section 161 or section 
145, as the case may be shall apply…” 
 
After having glance of above-mentioned relevant 
provisions of law, it is crystal clear that case diary should 
be written in the light of form 25.54 (1) of Police Rules, 
1934 and each sheet shall be numbered and stamped  
with the stamp of police station. Furthermore, two carbon 
copies shall be made by the Investigating Officer. He is 
duty bound that number and date of each case diary shall 
be recorded on the reverse of F.I.R and original case 
diary shall be dispatched without any unnecessary delay 
to the Inspector or other Superior Officer at headquarter. 
I have observed that almost in all criminal cases case 
diaries are being written by the Investigating Officers on 
loose printed papers, for the reason, the same are easily 
changeable. To curb down the issue of illegal practice 
qua changing of case diaries, a proper mechanism should 
be framed in future.

WP No. 6566 of 2023  
 
 
 
 
7. 
In the eventuality of above-mentioned circs, I am 
quite confident that arrest of Muhammad Saleem and Ali 
Raza detenus was made subsequently after passing of this 
Court’s order dated 07-09-2023. For the reasons, 
Muhammad Shabbir, SI has not written Rapat number, 
date and time of arrest in application for obtaining 
physical remand of the detenus and learned Magistrate 
Section 30, Bahawalpur has also not taken care of it. 
Learned Magistrate is directed to remain careful in 
future.  Resultantly, I set aside the order dated 
07.09.2023 about granting the physical remand of 
Muhammad Saleem and Ali Raza, detenus while 
exercising my power under section 561-A Cr.P.C. read 
with Rule 3 Part-F, Chapter 4, High Court Rules and 
Order Volume 5. 
 In the light of above, as no plausible evidence is 
available against Muhammad Saleem, detenu, for the 
reasons, he is discharged from the case F.I.R No. 434 
dated 23-08-2023 under section 324 P.P.C., Police 
Station Musafir Khana, District Bahawalpur whereas Ali 
Raza, detenu is hereby granted protective bail for five 
days i.e. till 13-05-2023 subject to his furnishing bail 
bonds in the sum of Rs.500000/- with one surety in the 
like amount to the satisfaction of Deputy Registrar (Judl.) 
of this Bench, to approach the learned Court concerned 
for availing the remedy of bail before arrest in terms of 
section 498 Cr.P.C.   
8. 
Before parting with this order, I would like to issue 
a direction in the name of District Police Officer, 
Bahawalpur to get lodge F.I.R against Nusrat SHO, 
Muhammad Shabbir, SI/I.O and Moharrar of the Police 
Station Musafir Khana, District Bahawalpur under 
section 155-C of Police Order, 2002 due to the defiance

of directions issued by this Court in case titled as “Qari 
Muhammad Atta Ullah vs. District Police Officer Sialkot 
and another” (PLD 2022 Lahore 224), within a period 
of five days after receipt of certified copy of this Court’s 
order under intimation to the Deputy Registrar (Judicial) 
of this Bench.

(Punjab), Lahore and Director General, FIA, Islamabad 
with the direction to frame proper mechanism keeping in 
view the guidelines mentioned below:-
