months prior to this occurrence, one Muhammad Fiyyaz abducted my 
daughter Mst. Saima Bibi with the intention to commit zina with her. My 
daughter Saima Bibi ran away from the clutches of one Muhammad Fiyyaz 
after one month of her abduction. Saima Bibi got registered the criminal case 
against one Muhammad Fiyyaz in police station Dhor Kot. From the day of 
her return from the clutches of one Muhammad Fiyyaz, my son in law 
namely Muhammad Imran alias Aamir started teasing my daughter due to 
her abduction. Accused Imran alias Aamir misbehaved her that she went to 
Fiyyaz Ahmad with her consent due to illicit relations. I changed the 
residence of my daughter in the area of Trend Busharat due to fear of murder 
of my daughter from hands of her husband. 
 
  
On 24.11.2020 at about 07:00 a.m. (morning) Muhammad Imran 
alias Aamir alongwith one unknown accused person came to my house on

my daughter to go with him but Imran alias Aamir sworn on oath that he 
shall return her daughter at my house Trend Bushrat at evening time safely. 
On the same day, at Maghrib vela, my son in law returned alone in my house 
in worried condition and told me that her daughter became missing from 
Darbar Syed Jalal Ud Din and I did not commit anything with her daughter. 
I searched my daughter with the help of witnesses but she was not found 
anywhere. I strongly suspected that Imran alias Aamir (present in the court) 
abducted my daughter with intention to murder her. 1 got drafted 
application/complaint Exh. P.A. on the next day which bears my thumb 
impression Exh.PA/1 as token of its correctness to police for registration of

alias  Aamir (present in the court). I alongwith P.W.S. reached at P.S. Uch 
Sharife where accused Imran alias Aamir (present in the court) disclosed in 
our presence that he committed the murder of my daughter Saima Bibi in the 
crop of sugarcane of Sami Sain Gilani . He took us and police party to the

7. 
On 31.03.2022, the learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor  gave up the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Sarwar, Muhammad Javed 678/C and 
Muhammad Azam 1731/C as being unnecessary and closed the prosecution 
evidence after tendering the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
(Exh. P.O.).  
 
8. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined 
appellant namely Muhammad Imran alias Aamir son of Hazoor Bakhsh  under 
section 342 Cr.P.C. and in answer to question why this case against you and why 
the P.W.s have deposed against you, he replied that he was innocent and had been 
falsely involved in the case. He further stated that he had not committed the 
occurrence and had been made a scapegoat in the case in order to show efficiency 
by the police. The appellant, namely Muhammad Imran alias Aamir son of 
Hazoor Bakhsh  opted  not to get himself   examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C 
did not adduce any evidence in his defence.

9. 
On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Bahawalpur, convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to above.  
 
10. 
The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant precisely is that the 
whole case is fabricated and false. The learned counsel for the appellant 
submitted that the prosecution remained unable to prove the facts in issue and did 
not produce any unimpeachable, admissible and relevant evidence. The learned 
counsel for the appellant further contended that the statements of prosecution 
witnesses were not worthy of any reliance. The learned counsel for the appellant 
also argued that the recoveries were full of procedural defects, of no legal worth 
and value and result of fake proceedings. The learned counsel for the appellant 
finally submitted that the prosecution had totally failed to prove the case against 
the appellant beyond the shadow of doubt.   
11. 
  On the other hand, learned Deputy Prosecutor General  along with the 
learned counsel for the complainant, contended that the prosecution had proved 
its case beyond shadow of doubt by producing independent witnesses. The 
learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the complainant 
further argued that the deceased was murdered by the appellant who had been last 
seen taking away the deceased. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General  and the 
learned counsel for the complainant further argued that the recoveries from the 
appellant also corroborated the statements of the other witnesses. The learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the complainant 
contended that there was no occasion for the prosecution witnesses, who were 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022

related to the deceased, to substitute the real offender with the innocent in this 
case. Lastly, The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for 
the complainant   prayed for the rejection of appeal. 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned counsel 
for the complainant, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General and with their 
assistance carefully perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial. 
 
13. 
After consideration of the contentions raised by learned counsel for the 
respective parties and scanning the evidence, it is pertinent to mention here that 
in the instant matter, ocular evidence is not available. There can be no dispute 
regarding the fact that the case is built on circumstantial evidence. In dealing with 
circumstantial evidence, the rules especially applicable to such evidence must be 
borne in mind. In such cases, there is always the danger that conjecture or 
suspicion may take the place of legal proof and therefore, it is right to recall the 
warning addressed by Baron Alderson to the jury in Reg. V. Hodge, (1938) 2 
Lewin 227) where he said:  
"The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circumstances 
to one another, and even in straining them a little, if need be, to 
force them to form parts of one connected whole; and the more 
ingenious the mind of the individual, the more likely was it, 
considering such matters, to overreach and mislead itself, to 
supply some little link that is wanting , to take for granted some 
fact consistent with its previous theories and necessary to render 
them complete."

 Sir Alfred Wills, in his book "An Essay on the Principles of Circumstantial 
Evidence" (pages 173 to 190 of the Fifth American, from the Fourth London 
Edition published in 1872), lays down the following rules specially to be 
observed in the case of circumstantial evidence:  
"RULE 1.   The facts  alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be 
clearly proved, and indubitably connected with the factum probandum. 
RULE   2. The burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the 
existence of any fact which infers legal accountability 
RULE 3.    In  all cases, whether of  direct or  circumstantial evidence, 
the best evidence must be  adduced which the nature of  the case admits  
RULE 4.-  In order to justify the inference of guilt the inculpatory facts 
must be   incompatible with the innocence of   the accused, and incapable 
of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt. 
RULE 5.    If   there be any reasonable doubt of   the guilt of   the accused, 
he  is  entitled, as  of right, to  be   acquitted." 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled "Naveed 
Asghar and two others Vs. The State" (P L D 2021 Supreme Court 600) has 
enunciated the following principle of law for the appreciation of circumstantial 
evidence:  
          "Approach to determine sufficiency of circumstantial evidence 
14. The settled approach to deal with the question as to sufficiency of 
circumstantial evidence for conviction of the accused person is this: If, 
on the facts and circumstances proved, no hypothesis consistent with the 
innocence of the accused person can be suggested, the case is fit for 
conviction of the accused person on such conclusion; however, if such 
facts and circumstances can be reconciled with any reasonable 
hypothesis compatible with the innocence of the appellant, the case is to 
be treated one of insufficient evidence, resulting in acquittal of the 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
11 
 
 
accused person. Circumstantial evidence, in a murder case, should be 
like a well-knit chain, one end of which touches the dead body of the 
deceased and the other the neck of the accused. No link in chain of the 
circumstances should be broken and the circumstances should be such 
as cannot be explained away on any reasonable hypothesis other than 
guilt of accused person. Chain of such facts and circumstances has to 
be completed to establish guilt of the accused person beyond reasonable 
doubt and to make the plea of his being innocent incompatible with the 
weight of evidence against him. Any link missing from the chain breaks 
the whole chain and renders the same unreliable; in that event, 
conviction cannot be safely recorded, especially on a capital charge. 
Therefore, if the circumstantial evidence is found not of the said 
standard and quality, it will be highly unsafe to rely upon the same for 
conviction; rather, not to rely upon such evidence will a better and a 
safer course." 
 
Thus, in a case of circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must establish each 
instance of incriminating circumstance by way of reliable and clinching evidence, 
and the circumstances so proved must form a complete chain of events, on the 
basis of which no conclusion other than one of guilt of the accused can be 
reached. Undoubtedly, suspicion, however, grave it may be, can never be treated 
as a substitute for proof. From the evidence of the prosecution available on record, 
it is clear that the case of the prosecution hinges upon the evidence of the recovery 
of the dead body of the deceased on the pointing of the appellant, the deceased 
being last seen alive in the company of the appellant , the  recoveries of articles 
from the place of the recovery of the dead body and  the report of Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.O.) regarding the D.N.A. analysis of the items 
submitted to the same and the recovery of the motorcycle (P-10) and the knife (P-
6) . 
14.       Firstly, we shall deliberate upon the evidence of the prosecution that the 
dead body of the deceased was recovered at the pointing of the appellant. The 
learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the complainant 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
12 
 
 
have vehemently argued that as the appellant, after his arrest, pointed out the place 
from where the dead body was recovered, hence, there was sufficient evidence to 
prove that it was indeed the appellant who had killed the deceased. We have 
scrutinized the prosecution evidence and have noted that every prosecution 
witness who was examined with regard to the recovery of the dead body of the 
deceased had a different version to narrate of the said recovery. According to the 
prosecution witness namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) , the complainant of the case, it 
was on 25.11.2020 at about 11.00 p.m that  she received a call from the Police 
Station telling her that the appellant had been arrested and after getting the said 
information she along with other witnesses went to the Police Station where the 
appellant was present in police custody and  in the presence of the witnesses 
disclosed that he could lead to the place where the dead body of the deceased was 
present and subsequent to this statement, the appellant got recovered the dead 
body of the deceased from the land belonging to one Sami Gillani. The relevant 
portion of the statement of the prosecution witness namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) 
reads as under:- 
"I got drafted application/complaint Exh. P.A. on the next day which bears 
my thumb impression Exh.PA/1 as token of its correctness to police for 
registration of F.I.R. After registration of F.I.R., police came at my house Trend 
Busharat/place of occurrence and inspected the place of occurrence. Police 
called me telephonically at 11:00 p.m. that they arrested the accused Imran 
alias  Aamir (present in the court). I alongwith P.W.S. reached at P.S. Uch 
Sharife where accused Imran alias Aamir (present in the court) disclosed in our 
presence that he committed the murder of my daughter Saima Bibi in the crop 
of sugarcane of Sami Sain Gilani . He took us and police party to the crop of 
sugarcane where dead body of my daughter was lying there. Her neck was cut 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
13 
 
 
off, a knife, motorcycle and two face masks were also lying there" (emphasis 
supplied) . 
Contrary to the above mentioned statement of  the prosecution witness namely 
Sakina Bibi (PW-1) it was on 25.11.2020 at about 11.00 p.m that  she received 
a call from the Police Station telling her that the appellant had been arrested and 
after getting the said information she along with other witnesses went  to the 
Police Station where the appellant was present in police custody and  in the 
presence of the witnesses disclosed that he could lead to the place where the dead 
body of the deceased was present and subsequent to this statement, the appellant 
got recovered the dead body of the deceased from the land belonging to one Sami 
Gillani, the other prosecution witness namely  Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) did not 
state that it was on 25.11.2020 that they proceeded to the Police Station , rather 
got recorded his statement that on 24.11.2020, the appellant had taken away the 
deceased at about 07.00 a.m, returned to the house of Sakina Bibi (PW-1) without 
the deceased at Maghrib Waila on 24.11.2020 and thereafter at 11.15 p.m. the 
police called the witnesses to the Police Station where the appellant was present 
in police custody and in the presence of the witnesses disclosed that he could lead 
to the place where the dead body of the deceased was present and subsequent to 
this statement, the appellant got recovered the dead body of the deceased. It would 
be advantageous to reproduce the relevant portion of the examination in-chief as 
recorded by the learned trial court of the prosecution witness namely Muhammad 
Riaz (PW-2). It was got recorded by Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) as under:- 
 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
14 
 
 
"On 24.11.2020, at about 07:00 a.m. (morning) I alongwith Ghulam Sarwar 
were sitting in the house of Sakina Bibi. In the meanwhile, Imran alias Amir 
alongwith one unknown accused came there on motorcycle and sought 
permission from Sakina Bibi to send her daughter with Imran alias Aamir for 
pervi of case (registered at P.S. Dhor Kot against Fiyyaz Jarah etc) and hazri of 
darbar Syed Jalal Ud Din. Sakina Bibi forbidden her daughter to go with him. 
But Imran alias Aamir sworn on oath that he shall return her daughter at her 
house Trend Bushrat at evening time safely. On the same day, at Maghrib 
vela, I alongwith Ghulam Sarwar were present in the house of Sakina Bibi 
where Imran alias Aamir son in law of Sakina Bibi returned alone in her house 
in worried condition and told us that Saima Bibi became missing from Darbar 
Syed Jalal Ud Din and I did not commit anything with her. Thereafter, we 
apprehended the accused Imran alias Aamir and started searching. During 
search, Imran alias Aamir ran away, thereafter, Sakina Bibi submitted an 
application against Imran Aamir for the registration of F.I.R. After registration 
of F.I.R., police came at the house of Sakina Bibi and inspected the place of 
occurrence. At about 11/11:15 p.m. police called us at police station where 
Imran alias Aamir was in police custody, and he disclosed in our presence that 
he committed murder of Saima Bibi and is ready to get recover the dead body 
of Saima Bibi (deceased). I alongwith Sarwar, Sakina Bibi complainant and 
police Uch Sharife and Bahawalpur reached at crop of sugarcane, Imran alias 
Aamir pointed out the dead body of Saima bibi and we identified the dead body 
of Saima Bibi in the light of torch," 
The relevant portion of the examination in-chief as recorded by the learned trial 
court of the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) reproduced 
above, also reflects that Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) never stated that it was on the 
next day that Sakina Bibi (PW-1) had submitted the application (Exh. P.A.) for 
the registration of the F.I.R rather stated that when the appellant succeeded to flee 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
15 
 
 
away during the search, Sakina Bibi (PW-1) submitted the application for the 
registration of the F.I.R.. Despite our repeated queries, both the learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the complainant are unable to 
refer to any part of the statement of the prosecution witness namely Muhammad 
Riaz (PW-2) wherein it had been stated that the dead body had been recovered 
on 25.11.2020 and not on 24.11.2020. In this manner, a fatal flaw has crept up in 
the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Riaz (PW-2). 
15. 
The scrutiny of the prosecution evidence also reveals that hugely 
contradictory statements were made by the prosecution witnesses regarding the  
time when the dead body was recovered. According to the prosecution witnesses 
namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) they got the 
information from the Police Station regarding the arrest of the appellant at 11.00 
p.m. and it was subsequent to getting this information that they went to the Police 
Station. It was further stated by the prosecution witnesses namely Sakina Bibi 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) that after their arrival at the Police Station, 
the appellant showed readiness to get the dead body of the deceased recovered. 
Sakina Bibi (PW-1) , during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
"We reached at the place of occurrence at 12:00 a.m. (night) on motorcycle. 
No person of locality was gathered there, thereafter police of uch sharif, police 
of Bahawalpur reached there." (emphasis supplied)  
 As mentioned above, though the prosecution witnesses namely Sakina Bibi (PW-
1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) remained at variance with regard to the day when 
the information was sent to them regarding the arrest of the appellant, however, 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
16 
 
 
both stated in unison that it was at 11.00 p.m.  that they were informed about the 
arrest of the appellant and it was thereafter that the appellant got recovered the 
dead body of the deceased. Contrary to the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) that it was 
after 11.00 p.m. that the dead body of the deceased was recovered, the 
prosecution witness namely Mudassir Irshad, Incharge Crime Scene Unit, (PW-
4) stated that on 25.11.2020, he arrived the place where the dead body of the 
deceased had been discovered at 08.43 p.m and left the place of the recovery of 
the dead body of the deceased at 11.27 p.m. Mudassir Irshad, Incharge Crime 
Scene Unit, (PW-4), during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
"We received the information about the occurrence at 07:16 p.m. on 
25.11.2020. We received information regarding murder in area of P.S. Uch 
Sharife. Mansoor Ul Hassan SI informed me about the occurrence. 
……….. 
We reached at the place of occurrence at about 08:43 p.m. When we reached 
at the place of occurrence Mansoor Ul Hassan SI alongwith Muhammad Azam 
constable, Ali Saghir constable and one lady constable were present there. 40/50 
persons of the locality were also gathered there. We completed our 
proceedings at the spot till 11:27 p.m." (emphasis supplied) . 
Mansoor ul Hassan, SI (PW-10), the Investigating Officer of the case, stated that 
he arrived at the place of recovery of the dead body, called the officials of Crime 
Scene Unit, Bahawalpur and they arrived at the place of recovery after 45 minutes 
of his call. Mansoor ul Hassan, SI (PW-10), the Investigating Officer of the case, 
during cross-examination , stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
17 
 
 
"I do not remember the time of reaching in the sugarcane crop of Sami Ul Hassan 
Gilani. I immediately called Crime Scene Unit team when I reached there. Team 
of Crime Scene Unit reached there within 45 minutes." (emphasis supplied). 
In this manner, according to Mansoor ul Hassan, SI (PW-10) , the Investigating 
Officer of the case, the officials of Crime Scene Unit, Bahawalpur arrived at the 
place of recovery after 45 minutes of his call and according to the statement of 
namely Mudassir Irshad, Incharge Crime Scene Unit, (PW-4), he had already 
received the information regarding the presence of the dead body on 25.11.2020 
at 07.16 p.m and  he arrived the place where the dead body of the deceased had 
been discovered at 08.43 p.m. Similarly, contradicting the prosecution witnesses 
namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) , the prosecution 
witness namely Ali Sagheer 545/C (PW-5) stated that it was at about 07.00/07.15 
p.m., when they arrived at the place of the recovery of the dead body. Ali Sagheer 
545/C (PW-5) during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
"I do not remember the time of our arrival at the place of occurrence. 
Volunteered that it was after Maghrib and Isha time. It was just after Isha. The 
time of Isha in November December is about 07/7:15 pm" (emphasis 
supplied)  
Therefore, it is proved that the dead body was recovered even before the 
information had been given to the prosecution witnesses namely Sakina Bibi 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2), regarding the arrest of the appellant,  
which information they had received at about 11.00 p.m and  even before the 
arrival of the prosecution witnesses namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Riaz (PW-2) at the Police Station after which the appellant had allegedly  got 
recovered the dead body .The above reproduced portions of the statements of 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
18 
 
 
Mudassir Irshad, Incharge Crime Scene Unit, (PW-4), Ali Sagheer 545/C (PW-
5) and Mansoor ul Hassan, SI (PW-10)  are themselves sufficient to denude the 
false claim of the prosecution witnesses namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) that they had received the information regarding the 
arrest of the appellant at 11.00 p.m , arrived at the Police Station  subsequently 
and  thereafter the dead body was discovered on the pointing of the place of 
occurrence by the appellant for the simple fact that  according to Mudassir Irshad, 
Incharge Crime Scene Unit, (PW-4)  he and the other witnesses  had already 
received the information regarding the presence of the dead body on 25.11.2020 
at 07.16 p.m  and Mudassir Irshad, Incharge Crime Scene Unit, (PW-4) and Ali 
Sagheer 545/C (PW-5) arrived at the place where the dead body of the deceased 
had been discovered much before 11.00 p.m. These statements of Mudassir 
Irshad, Incharge Crime Scene Unit, (PW-4), Ali Sagheer 545/C (PW-5) and 
Mansoor ul Hassan, SI (PW-10), regarding the time of their arrival at the place 
of recovery of the dead body of the deceased completely shatter the prosecution 
case that it was the appellant who had got recovered the dead body subsequent to 
his arrest.   
16. 
We have also noted that Mudassir Irshad, Incharge Crime Scene Unit, 
(PW-4) stated that on 25.11.2020, he went to the place where the dead body of 
the deceased had been discovered and collected relevant evidence which he 
handed over to Ali Sagheer 545/C (PW-5)  and Muhammad Azam in the presence 
of Investigating Officer of the case, however, he never stated that it was the 
appellant who had got recovered the said dead body or even if the appellant was 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
19 
 
 
even present at the said place. Mudassir Irshad, Incharge Crime Scene Unit, (PW-
4) in his statement before the learned trial court , stated as under:- 
"On 25.11.2020, I was posted as Incharge Crime Scene Unit PFSA 
Bahawalpur. On the same day, I alongwith my team after receiving 
telephonic call went to place of occurrence Mouza Uch Gilani Uch Sharif 
in sugar cane crop where Muhammad Azam, Ali Saghir police officials 
alongwith Mansoor Ul Hassan SI were present. I alongwith my team 
inspected the place where the dead body of deceased lady was lying on 
ground in the field of sugar cane. I collected the relevant evidence and 
sealed them into parcels containing eight parcels knife P6, blue colour face 
mask blood stained P7, black colour shoe P8, blue colour face mask P9, 
suspected hairs having roots, two right hand finger nails swabs, two left 
hands fingers, two buccal swabs were handed over to Saghir and 
Muhammad Azam in the presence of Mansoor Ul Hassan SI through 
Exhibit sheet. Mansoor Ul Hassan Si recorded my statement u/s 161 Cr. 
P.C. in this regard." 
 We have already reproduced the portion of the cross-examination of Mudassir 
Irshad, Incharge Crime Scene Unit, (PW-4) in which too he never spoke about 
the presence of the appellant at the place of the recovery of the dead body. The 
statement of Mudassir Irshad, Incharge Crime Scene Unit, (PW-4) is conspicuous  
by the non-mentioning of the presence of the appellant at the place of the presence 
of the dead body of the deceased.  
17. 
We have also noted Khawaja Kharat Hussain Siddiqui, Patwari (PW-9) , 
who prepared the scaled site plan of the place of occurrence (Exh.PM), also 
admitted during cross-examination that he had not mentioned in the site plan 
(Exh.PM) that it was the appellant who had pointed out the place of the recovery 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
20 
 
 
of the dead body of the deceased. Khawaja Kharat Hussain Siddiqui, Patwari 
(PW-9), during cross-examination , admitted as under:- 
"In the scale site plan of the place of recovery of dead body I have not 
mentioned that the said site plan has been prepared on the pointation of 
accused or accused has got recovered the dead body of Mst. Saima Bibi. It 
is correct that in the scale site plan it is not mentioned that accused has pointed 
out the said place." (emphasis supplied) . 
Similarly, Abdul Razzaq, SI (PW-11), another Investigating Officer of the case , 
during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
"It is also not written in the scaled site plan that on whom pointation dead body 
was recovered." 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) though had claimed 
that it was in his presence that the appellant had agreed to get the dead body 
recovered and subsequently also got recovered the same , however, it was proved  
during cross-examination that Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) had blatantly and 
dishonestly improved his previous statement wherein no such facts had been 
recorded. Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) was duly confronted during the cross-
examination  and the learned trial court observed as under:- 
"Police also recorded my supplementary statement regarding the recovery of 
dead body. I also recorded before the police that at about 11/11:15 p.m. police 
called us at police station where Imran alias Amir was in police custody. 
Confronted with Exh. D.B. where it is not so recorded. I further recorded 
before the police that accused Imran alias Amir disclosed in our presence that 
he committed the murder of Mst. Saima bibi and he is ready to get recover the 
dead body of Saima Bibi (deceased). Confronted with Exh. D.B. where it is 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
21 
 
 
not so recorded. I did not get record before the police that I alongwith 
Sakina Bibi, Ghulam Sarwar, police Uch Sharif and Bahawalpur police 
reached at the sugar cane crop of Sami Sain Gilani on the disclosure of 
accused." (emphasis supplied)  
Article 151  of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 provides as under:- 
"151. Impeaching credit of witness. The credit of a witness may be impeached in the 
following ways by the adverse party, or, with the consent of the Court, by the party who 
calls him: 
(1) by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their knowledge of the 
witness,believe him to be un worthy of credit; 
(2) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of a bribe, or has 
received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence ; 
(3) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is 
liable to be contradicted ;" 
By improving his previous statement, Muhammad Riaz (PW-2)  impeached his 
own credit. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases of "Muhammad 
Ashraf Vs. State" (2012 SCMR 419), "Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State" (2018 
SCMR 772) and Muhammad Arif Vs. The State (2019 SCMR 631) took a serious 
notice of the improvements introduced by witnesses and rejected their evidence. 
Furthermore , Mansoor ul Hassan, SI (PW-10) , the Investigating Officer of the 
case, admitted during cross-examination  that Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) had never 
stated that the appellant had got recovered the dead body of the deceased and stated 
as under:- 
"It is correct that PWs Muhammad Riaz and Ghulam Sarwar did not depose 
before me in their supplementary statements u/s 161 Cr. P.C. that accused 
Imran alias Amir got recovered the dead body of Mst. Saima Bibi after 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
22 
 
 
pointation. It is correct that during whole investigation, they also did not 
depose before me in their statements u/s 161 Cr. P.C. regarding confession of 
accused before them." (emphasis supplied)  
All these circumstances prove conclusively that the prosecution failed miserably 
to prove that the appellant had got recovered the dead body of the deceased. 
18. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also stated that the deceased was last seen in the company of 
the appellant and this fact also prove the guilt of the appellant. In order to prove 
the said fact, the prosecution examined prosecution witnesses namely Sakina Bibi 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2)   who stated that on 24.11.2020 at about 
07.00 a.m, the appellant  had taken away the deceased whereafter the deceased 
was never seen alive. We have scrutinized the statements of prosecution 
witnesses namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) and find that 
they remained unable to prove that it was indeed the appellant who on 24.11.2020 
at about 07.00 a.m had taken away the deceased with him. It was admitted by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) 
that the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) had a separate 
residence which was at a distance from the house of Sakina Bibi (PW-1), the 
house where the deceased was residing on 24.11.2020. The prosecution witness 
namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) also admitted that there was no reason for 
Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) to had been present at her house on 24.11.2020 and that 
Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) used to work at Faisalabad. The prosecution witness 
namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1), during cross-examination, stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
23 
 
 
"Houses of Riaz and Ghulam Sarwar are situated at the distance of 03 beghas 
from my house. Riaz is living at Faisalabad and working in a mill for last 05 
years.Ghulam Sarwar PW sells grocery items on his motorcycle. I cannot tell the 
distance between Faisalabad and Mouza Trend Busharat. There was no function 
on the day of occurrence at my house. PW Riaz and Ghulam Sarwar came 
there by chance." (emphasis supplied). 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) , during cross-
examination , stated as under:- 
“ Sakina Bibi is my real sister.  
…………. 
My house is separate from the house of Sakina Bibi. The distance between my 
house and house of Sakina bibi is about 4 begha. I and my brother Ghulam 
Sarwar are residing together in the same house. I am working in textile mill 
namely West Fiber Faisalabad for the last fourteen years. 6/7 hours are 
consumed in reaching Faisalabad on bus from Trend Busharat. There was no 
function at the house of Sakina Bibi. On 24.11.2020, I by chance present her 
house." (emphasis supplied). 
In this manner, when both prosecution witnesses namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) admitted that there was no reason for the presence of 
Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) at the house of Sakina Bibi (PW-1), then in what 
circumstances and for what reason Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) remained present at 
the house of Sakina Bibi (PW-1) from 07.00 a.m to Maghrib Waila, needed to be 
proved , however, no effort was made by the prosecution witnesses namely 
Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) to prove the said circumstances 
due to which prosecution witness namely Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) remained 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
24 
 
 
present for such an extended period at the house of Sakina Bibi (PW-1), enabling 
him to witness the departure of the deceased with the appellant and the return of 
the appellant alone. It was obviously a false claim of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) that Muhammad Riaz 
(PW-2) had remained at the house of Sakina Bibi (PW-1) from 07.00 a.m to 
Maghrib Waila. It was also admitted by prosecution witnesses namely Sakina 
Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) that the house of Sakina Bibi (PW-1) 
was situated in a well populated area, however, no person of the locality ever 
appeared before the Investigating Officer of the case or the learned trial court to 
state that they had seen the appellant visiting the house of Sakina Bibi (PW-1) on 
24.11.2020. Sakina Bibi (PW-1) , during cross-examination , admitted as under:- 
"Trend Busharat is a big populated Basti having approximately five hundreds 
houses. No persons of Basti Trend Busharat were associated by me during 
course of investigation as witness who saw accused Imran while coming to my 
house and took Mst. Saima Bibi with him on 24.11.2020. During whole 
investigation of this case, I did not produce any witness of locality who saw 
Imran alias Amir coming to my house at evening time on 24.11.2020." 
Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) , during cross-examination , admitted as under:- 
"Basti Trend Busharat is a thickly populated area and consists upon 4/5 
thousands houses I did not produce any person of Basti Trend Busharat before 
the police who saw the accused Imran alias Amir while coming and taking away 
Mst. Saima Bibi from the house of Sakina Bibi on 24.11.2020." 
We have also noted  that the prosecution witness namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) 
admitted that she did not report the matter of the missing of the deceased  on 
24.11.2020, despite her claim that the appellant had come back to her  house 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
25 
 
 
without the deceased at Maghrib Waila. It was also the claim of the prosecution 
witness namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) that she started the search for the deceased 
on 24.11.2020, however, she admitted that she did not produce any witness whom 
she had come across during her search of the deceased. The prosecution witness 
namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) , during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
"On next day of the abduction. I reported the matter to police station at maghrib 
time. I did not produce any person of places where I searched my daughter before 
the police during investigation" 
19.    Pre-requisites for believing the last seen evidence are the proximity of time 
and nearness of the place of occurrence. Interpreting these two principles, it is 
required that  deceased shall be seen in the company of the accused by the  witnesses 
some short time before happening of the incident and the  place of murder may not 
be far away from the place of lastly seeing the deceased in the company of the 
accused by the prosecution witnesses. The last seen theory comes into play where 
the time gap between the point of time when the accused and deceased were seen 
last alive and when the deceased is found dead is so small that possibility of any 
person other than the accused being the author of the crime becomes impossible. 
According to the prosecution witnesses namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Riaz (PW-2)  they had seen the appellant taking the deceased on 24.11.2020 at 
about 07.00 a.m. The dead body of the deceased was discovered on 25.11.2020. 
The dead body of the deceased was brought to the hospital on 26.11.2020 at about 
01.20 a.m. Dr.Qurat-ul-Ain (PW-7)  conducted the postmortem examination of the 
dead body of Saima Bibi daughter of Muhammad Shafi  (deceased) on 26.11.2020 
at about 08.00 a.m. Dr.Qurat-ul-Ain (PW-7), after conducting the postmortem 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
26 
 
 
examination of the dead body of Saima Bibi daughter of Muhammad Shafi  
(deceased) opined that the time between death and post mortem examination was 
within twenty four hours. The opinion of Dr.Qurat-ul-Ain (PW-7) regarding the 
death of the deceased having taken place twenty four hours prior to the post mortem 
examination creates a gaping hole in the prosecution case as there exists a huge gap 
between the time when the deceased was last seen in the company of the appellant 
i.e on 24.11.2020 at 07.00 a.m and the time when the deceased was murdered 
determined to be as being subsequent to 08.00 a.m. on 25.11.2020. In this manner, 
it is proved that the prosecution failed to establish that the deceased was seen lastly 
in the company of the appellant. Even otherwise ,last seen together is a weak type 
of circumstantial evidence, which cannot be readily believed unless it was 
corroborated through unimpeachable source, and it should be close to the time and 
place of murder to exclude the possibility of innocence. As mentioned above, the  
last seen theory comes into play where the time gap between the point of time when 
the accused and deceased were seen last alive and when the deceased is found dead 
is so small that possibility of any person other than the accused being the author of 
the crime becomes impossible. In this case, the element of the proximity of the time 
of last seeing the deceased and the time of her death is missing. It is settled law that 
the last seen evidence can have legal worth only if the deceased is seen in the 
company of the accused quite close to the time of his death so as to exclude any 
possibility of the deceased coming in contact with anybody else before his death. 
But it is  also settled law that the only circumstance of last seen will not complete 
the chain of circumstances to record the finding that it is consistent only with the 
hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and, therefore, no conviction on that basis 
alone can be founded. Reliance is placed on the case of  Sadi Ahmad and another 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
27 
 
 
Vs. The State (2019 SCMR 1220) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
has held as under:- 
"We are not much impressed by the evidence of last seen for being outside the 
bounds of proximity in terms of time and space, besides otherwise being far from 
confidence inspiring". 
Reliance is also placed on the case of  Muhammad Abid Vs. The State  and another 
(P L D 2018 Supreme Court 813) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
has enunciated the following principle:- 
"The theory of last seen together is one where two persons are 'seen together' alive 
and after an interval of time, one of them is found alive and the other dead. If the 
period between the two is short, presumption can be drawn that the person alive is 
the author of the other's death. Time gap between the sighting and the occurrence 
should be such as to rule out possibility of somebody else committing the crime. 
The circumstance of the deceased being last seen in the company of the accused is 
not by itself sufficient to sustain the charge of murder. There must be evidence to 
link the accused with the murder of his companion, such as incriminating facts as 
recovery, strong motive and the proximate time when they were last seen together 
and the time when the deceased was killed. Last seen evidence as circumstantial 
evidence must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and should be 
accepted with great caution. It must be scrutinized minutely so that no plausible 
conclusion should be drawn therefrom except guilt of the accused. 
6. The foundation of the "last seen together" theory is based on principles of 
probability and cause and connection and requires 1. cogent reasons that the 
deceased in normal and ordinary course was supposed to accompany the accused. 
2. proximity of the crime scene. 3. small time gap between the sighting and crime 
4. no possibility of third person interference 5. motive. 6. time of death of victim. 
The circumstance of last seen together does not by itself necessarily lead to the 
inference that it was the accused who committed the crime. There must be 
something more establishing connectivity between the accused and the crime." 
 
Hence, in view of the above discussion, the last seen evidence furnished by the 
prosecution witnesses is not confidence inspiring, therefore, the same cannot be 
relied upon.  
 
20.     The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also laid much stress upon the report of the Punjab Forensic 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022

Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.O.), wherein it had been determined that the 
D.N.A. profile obtained from the swabs taken from the face mask and the D.N.A. 
profile obtained from the hair recovered from the face mask and the D.N.A. 
profile obtained from the shoe ,which all articles were recovered from the place 
of occurrence,  were a mixture of at least two individuals and the appellant could 
not be excluded as being a contributor to the D.N.A. obtained from the swabs 
taken from the face mask , the hair recovered from the face mask and the shoe. 
In Chapter 17 'Examination of Biological Stains and Hair", from page 430 to page 
440 of Rai Bahadur Jaising P. Modi's A Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and 
Toxicology (26th  Edition 2018) it has been discoursed as under:- 
"DNA 
PROFILING 
(DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC 
ACID 
TYPING)  
General- 
Life on earth is based on cells; Cell is the basic unit of life. There are 
around trillions of cells in a human blood. Every cell has a nucleus 
(except the RBCS); Inside the nucleus which is considered to be the 
central processing unit of the cell, 23 pairs of chro-mosomes are 
present. Twenty-two pairs of autosomal chromosomes and one pair of 
sex chromosomes (XX in females and X.Y. in males). Chromosomes 
carry linearly arranged genetic units, which are materially referred as 
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (D.N.A.). There are about 3 billion 
nucleotides in human D.N.A. Human D.N.A. is approximately 2 
metres long if it is place end to end from 46 chromosomes of a single 
cell. D.N.A. is present in coiled and super coiled form in the cell. The 
super coiled structures are known as the chromosomes. This D.N.A. 
contains genetic information which decides the phenotypic character 
(height, skin colour, eye colour, hair colour, etc) of an individual. The 
D.N.A. carries the genetic information from parents to offspring, 
being half of the D.N.A. from mother and the other half from father. 
The D.N.A. carries all the information to make proteins (hormones, 
antibodies, enzymes and structural proteins like actin, myosin, keratin, 
tubuline) for proper functioning of the body. Another class of D.N.A. 
present in human cell is the mitochondrial D.N.A. which is present in 
the cell organelle mitochondria. Unlike nuclear D.N.A. mitochondrial 
D.N.A. is maternally inherited because the mitochondria of sperm are 
present in the tail and the tails is digested by hyluronic acid present 
around the egg cell at the time of fertilization. The D.N.A. is the 
genetic material that makes every individual different, except for 
genetically identical twins. A pattern of chemical signals ie, genetic 
code, has been discovered within the D.N.A. molecule, which is very 
unique to each individual, just like their actual fingerprint. Thus, the 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
29 
 
 
D.N.A. profiling, unique to each individual, is colloquially referred to 
as 'D.N.A. Fingerprinting' and it is also known as D.N.A. typing. The 
companies who offer the D.N.A. profiling claim that a D.N.A. match 
of two individuals is as unlikely as 1 in 30 billion. One more 
estimation puts it at 1 in 800, 000, 000 The chemical D.N.A. was first 
discovered in 1869, but its role in genetic inheritance was not 
demonstrated until 1943. In 1944, Oswald Avery made the 
breakthrough discovery that D.N.A. is the basic genetic material. A 
few years later, in 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick determined 
that the structure of D.N.A. is a double-helix polymer, a spiral 
consisting of two D.N.A. strands wound around each other. The 
technique of D.N.A. Fingerprinting was 229 first developed in 1984 
by Dr Alec Jeffreys from Britain. Since then, increasing attention has 
been paid around the world to the use of D.N.A. profiling for 
individualization purposes in criminal and allied cases. Paternity 
testing is another important use through D.N.A. since 1988. The use 
of Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of 
minisatellites or Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR) loci 
scattered along the chromosomes has spread interest among the 
medico legal professionals. The use of microsatellites or Short 
Tandem Repeats (S.T.R.s) also gained momentum with the passing 
years. These are consecutive repeats that are abundantly found in 
D.N.A. In contrast to 100-200 bps length of RFLPS and VNTRs, the 
STRS are of a smaller length of 2-10 bps. The short size of STRS is 
particularly useful if the sample is degraded or with Low Copy 
Number (L.C.N.) D.N.A. Such degraded or fragmented D.N.A. is 
encountered in samples that have been exposed to hostile external 
environment conditions like sunlight, heat, excessive salt etc. The 
traditional techniques like RFLP and VNTRS are not very helpful in 
such cases. The variants of STRS including Autosomal STR, MINI-
STR, Y-STR and X-STR have immensely contributed to the forensic 
field. Three types of results are possible after comparing the question 
sample (Q) and the known sample (K) in cases of autosomal, Y and X 
STR markers analysis. These are-(1) Exclusion This result is produced 
when the STR haplotypes are different and could not have originated 
from the same source. (2) Inclusion (or failure to exclude)- This result 
is produced when STR haplotypes that result from Q-K comparison 
are the same and could have originated from the same source. (3) 
Inconclusive:-The result is inconclusive  when the data are insufficient 
to render an interpretation or in other words ,ambiguous results are 
obtained. 
The Autosomal STR markers: are commonly used to establish 
identity and settle paternity disputes. They are studied on all the 22 
pairs of autosomes to avoid linkage issues within the markers.

Samples required for D.N.A. profiling. Any biological material such 
as a drop of blood, saliva, semen, and any body part such as bones, 
tissue, skull, teeth, and hair with the root found at the scene of crime 
may serve as a sample for D.N.A. profiling. The CDFD gives the 
following guidelines about collecting samples: 
 (i) Maternity/paternity/parentage: Blood samples of mother, disputed 
child and alleged father are required. The blood samples (2 - 3ml) can 
be collected in the sterile blood collection material (EDTA vials) sent 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
30 
 
 
by the laboratory, in the presence of Court authorities. These samples 
should be sent in ice in a thermos flask either by a messenger or 
through courier, so as to reach the laboratory within 72 hours after 
collection. (ii) Identity of the deceased: Any body part of the deceased 
found at the scene of crime along with the blood samples of the blood 
relatives of the suspected individuals (viz., parents, and children) 
should be sent. 
 (iii) Identity of rape/rapist: Blood / semen stained clothes, garments, 
swabs, and slides of the victim and the accused is forwarded to the 
laboratory.  
……………………………………………………………. 
Problems linked with D.N.A. profiling. One of the lasting effects of the 
OJ Simpson case will likely be greater scrutiny by defence lawyers of the 
prosecution's forensic D.N.A. presented in criminal cases. In the Simpson 
case, the defence, in essence, put the crime evidence laboratory on trial. 
There is no substantial dispute about the underlying scientific principles 
in D.N.A. profiling, however, the adequacy of laboratory procedures and 
the competence of the experts who testify should remain open to inquiry.  
Although, there is a common consensus within the scientific community 
that D.N.A. profiling can yield results with a very high probability, the 
complex procedure of D.N.A. profiling is not without problems. At every 
phase of the seven-step procedure just described, mistakes and improper 
handling of the DNA-probe can produce false results which in some 
cases can lead to a life sentence or even death-penalty judgement. 
Therefore, the adequacy of laboratory procedures and the competence of 
the experts who testify should remain open to inquiry.  
Furthermore, the D.N.A. samples can be mixed up by the police or the 
laboratory personnel (this actually took place in one case) or the 
amount of D.N.A. can be insufficient. The various contaminants 
include microbes, fibres, concrete, soil, vegetable  matter, other body 
fluids besides foreign D.N.A. from field agents and laboratory 
workers. It can be avoided by handling the forensic evidence at a place 
that is segregated from the , where amplication of the sample is to be 
conducted. If the sample is accidentally mixed with foreign D.N.A. 
before amplification, the contaminant will also get amplified resulting 
in mixed profiles at the time of STR analysis. Secondly, a significant 
'source of error' is the incomplete digestion of the D.N.A. by the 
restriction enzymes. The other extreme can be an over-digestion also 
called 'star activity'. Thirdly, a 'band shift' can occur, meaning that the 
D.N.A. fragments which are put in several lanes next to each other can 
influence each other's mobility, thus causing wrong results of the gel 
electrophoresis. In connection with the problem of 'band shift', the gel 
electrophoresis itself may not be conducted properly, i.e., the voltage 
can be too low or too high or the concentration of the gel can be 
incorrect. Finally, the expert who determines a match can be biased". 
In our legal framework D.N.A. evidence is evaluated on the strength of 
Articles 59 and 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 (QSO). The former 
provision states that expert opinion on matters such as science and art falls 
within the ambit of 'relevant evidence'. On the other hand, the latter provision 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
31 
 
 
provides that the Court may allow the reception of any evidence that may 
become available because of modern devices and techniques. Under this 
regime, the technician who conducts experiment to scrutinize D.N.A. evidence 
is regarded as an expert whose opinion is admissible in Court. Subsection (3) 
of Section 9 of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency Act, 2007, reaffirms this 
legal position when it enacts that "a person appointed in the Agency as an 
expert shall be deemed as an expert appointed under Section 510 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1898] and a person specially skilled in a forensic 
material under Article 59 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 (P.O. X of 1984)." 
A combined reading of all these provisions shows that the report of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency regarding D.N.A. analysis is per se admissible in 
evidence under Section 510, Cr.P.C. Since D.N.A. analysis report is reckoned 
as a form of expert evidence in criminal cases, it cannot be treated as primary 
evidence and can be relied upon only for purposes of corroboration. This 
implies that no case can be decided exclusively on its basis. Credibility of the 
D.N.A. test inter alia depends on the standards employed for the collection and 
transmission of samples to the laboratory. It is essential that any item being 
sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for D.N.A. analysis is not 
contaminated or compromised or manipulated or subverted at any stage. Proper 
standing operating procedures have to be followed for securing and carefully 
putting into the parcel the suspected materials to co-relate with the samples of 
the accused. Similarly, cross contamination of the samples must be prevented 
because if the samples come in contact with each other then, it will give false 
positive result. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed in the case 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
32 
 
 
of Azeem Khan and another Vs. Mujahid Hussain and others (P.L.J. 2016 SC 123) 
has held as under:- 
"In the recent past many scandals in U.S.A., U.K. and other countries have 
surfaced where desired D.N.A. test reports were procured by the investigative 
by contaminating the samples. Such contamination has also been reported in 
some cases while the samples remained in the laboratories. Many inquires were 
held on this issue and stringent law has been made by many States to prevent 
the contamination of samples outside and inside the laboratories. Proper 
procedure has been laid down for securing and carefully putting into parcel the 
suspected materials to co-relate with the samples of the parents to establish 
paternity or maternity. Similarly, stringent check and procedure has been 
provided to avoid and prevent cross contamination of the two samples because 
if both come in contact with each others then, it will give false positive 
appearance and the expert is thus misled. It has also been discovered that 
credentials of many experts, claiming possessed of higher qualification in this 
particular field, were found fake and they were thus, removed from service. The 
D.N.A. Wikipedia on web is an unrebutted testimony to these facts. 
28. In any case, it is an expert opinion and even if it is admitted into the evidence 
and relied upon, would in no manner be sufficient to connect the necks of the 
appellants with the commission of the crime when the bulk of other evidence 
has been held by us unbelievable thus, no reliance can be placed on it to award 
a capital sentence. Moreover, to ensure fair-play and transparency, the samples 
in the laboratories from the parents should have been taken in the presence of 
some independent authority like a Magistrate and also the recovered samples 
from the crime scene in the same way to dispel the chances of fabrication of 
evidence through corrupt practices and the transition of the samples to the 
laboratory should have also been made in a safe and secure manner. But all 
these safeguards were kept aside." 
In the present case we have been shocked to notice that according to the report 
of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.O.) , the items sent to 
it were neither sent in sealed parcels nor in sealed envelopes rather the items 
were received at the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore without being 
secured in sealed parcels or sealed envelopes. Moreover, though the appellant 
had been arrested on 25.11.2020, however, Mansoor ul Hassan, SI (PW-10) , 
the Investigating Officer of the case, took the appellant as well as the articles 
to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore on the same day, opening up 
the clear and present likelihood of  the contamination of the articles being sent to 
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for D.N.A. analysis . According to 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
33 
 
 
the prosecution evidence, Mansoor ul Hassan, SI (PW-10) , the Investigating 
Officer of the case, not only took with him the appellant but also the various items 
and in that scenario, cross contamination could not be ruled out. The prosecution 
miserably failed to prove that the articles which had been sent to the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore had not come into contact with the appellant 
during their journey from the Police Station to the Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore. In this manner, the prosecution failed to prove that  items which 
were sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for D.N.A. analysis 
were not contaminated  or compromised or manipulated or subverted  at any 
stage and in absence of that evidence no reliance can be place on the report of 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.O.). We have queried the 
learned Deputy Prosecutor General to clarify that when according to the report of 
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.O.) the items sent to it for 
D.N.A. analysis were received in the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore  
neither in sealed parcels nor in sealed envelopes then how can the said report be  
relied upon but, after going through the record of this case from cover to cover, 
the learned Deputy Prosecutor General  remained unable to explain as to why the 
articles sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore were not  sent in 
sealed parcels or sealed envelopes.. We have also noted that according to the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PO) , it had retained the items sent 
to it for DNA analysis with a direction to recover the items within 15 days of the 
issuance of the report however the prosecution did not lead any evidence that who 
had brought back the face mask (P-7), the other face mask (P-9) and the shoe (P-
8) from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore so as for them to be 
produced and exhibited before the learned trial court. All these  facts by 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
34 
 
 
themselves create sufficient cause for not placing any reliance upon the report of 
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.O.) 
 
21. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the recovery of the motorcycle (P-10) and have 
submitted that it was the same motorcycle which was used by the appellant to 
take away the deceased from the house of Sakina Bibi (PW-1). We have noticed 
that the prosecution witnesses namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz 
(PW-2), in their statements before the learned trial court, did not state either the 
make or the colour or the registration number or the model number of the 
motorcycle upon which the appellant had allegedly taken away the deceased from 
the house of Sakina Bibi (PW-1) , therefore, the recovered motorcycle (P-10) 
cannot be said to be the same which had been used by the appellant on 24.11.2020 
for taking away the deceased from the house of Sakina Bibi (PW-1). 
 
22.    The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the recovery of the knife  (P-6) and stated that 
it was the knife which was used by the appellant during the occurrence .We have 
already discussed that the various prosecution witnesses made mutually 
destructive and contradictory statements with regard to the recovery of the knife 
(P-6) and therefore it cannot be said with any certainty that it was the appellant 
who had got recovered the knife (P-6) from the place of occurrence. Moreover, 
we have also noted that  though the said knife (P-6) was sent to the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for analysis , however, according to the report 
of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.O.) no D.N.A. of the 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
35 
 
 
appellant was found either on the handle or the blade of the knife (P-6) . When 
an individual touches an object, epithelial cells are left behind. Touch D.N.A. is 
also known as epithelial D.N.A. The same traditional D.N.A. analysis procedures 
are used to analyze and examine these remaining epithelial cells as are used to 
analyze and examine bodily fluids. The amount left behind is often less than 100 
picograms and is also called low copy D.N.A. This is evidence with "no visible 
staining that would likely contain D.N.A. resulting from the transfer of epithelial 
cells from the skin to an object. Due to development, lower amounts of human 
D.N.A. can be detected and, possibly, a full or partial STR profile can be 
generated. D.N.A. evidence has emerged as a powerful tool to identify 
perpetrators of unspeakable crimes and to exonerate innocent individuals accused 
of similarly heinous actions. The technology has  advanced to Polymerase Chain 
Reaction (PCR) based short tandem repeat (STR) testing. This system multiplies 
a single copy of a D.N.A. segment to allow for the analysis of the genetic makeup 
of a small sample. Current analysis makes it possible to determine whether a 
biological tissue matches a suspect with near certainty. D.N.A. is comprised of 
"coding" and "non-coding regions. The loci examined are found on "junk 
D.N.A.," which are segments of the D.N.A. not known to code for any specific 
trait, but known to be different between individuals. "Junk D.N.A." are the non-
coding regions which contain valuable information about identity, but do not 
contain information regarding coding for other genetic traits. This allows the 
development of a D.N.A. profile without an examination into other genetic 
markers. The report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.O.) 
supports the claim of the appellant that he was innocent for the reason that had 
the appellant handled the knife (P-6)  then his D.N.A. profile must had been 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
36 
 
 
obtained from the said item because had he touched the knife (P-6) , then the 
epithelial cells from the skin of the appellant must have been left behind on the 
knife (P-6)  handled by him and subsequently the presence of D.N.A. profile of 
the appellant would have been identified on the knife (P-6) handled by him by 
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore . The absence of any D.N.A. profile 
of the appellant on the knife (P-6)  sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore for D.N.A. analysis creates further doubt regarding the involvement of 
the appellant in the occurrence . 
23. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and submitted that it 
corroborated the ocular account. The motive of the occurrence as stated by 
prosecution witnesses namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2) 
was that four months before the occurrence, the deceased was abducted by one 
Muhammad  Fayyaz, however, upon the return of the deceased , the appellant 
became doubtful over the character of the deceased and subsequently murdered 
her . We have perused the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Sakina 
Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2)  and find that they failed to prove the 
motive of the occurrence as stated by them. It was stated by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Sakina Bibi (PW-1) and Muhammad Riaz (PW-2), that they 
did not report the matter of abduction of the deceased to the police, rather, it was 
the deceased herself who reported the said occurrence of her abduction. Sakina 
Bibi (PW-1) , during her cross-examination , stated as under:- 
"Saima Bibi was abducted by Muhammad Fiyaz etc four months prior to the 
occurrence in the area of Mouza Trend Busharat as she was living in my house. 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
37 
 
 
She came back one month prior to this occurrence. I myself did not get lodged 
the F.I.R. regarding the abduction of Mst. Saima Bibi against Fiyaz etc during 
three months of her abduction." 
The prosecution also did not produce any copy of the F.I.R which was got 
registered by the deceased in relation to her abduction by one Muhammad 
Fayyaz. The Investigating Officer of the case also did not collect any evidence in 
support of the allegation that upon the return of the deceased after being abducted, 
the appellant became doubtful over the character of  the deceased and 
subsequently murdered her. There is no evidence on record that Saima Bibi 
daughter of Muhammad Shafique (deceased) was facing any threat to her life at 
the hands of the appellant prior to the occurrence. The prosecution witnesses 
failed to provide evidence enabling us to determine the truthfulness of the motive 
alleged and the fact that the said motive was so compelling that it could have led 
the appellant to have committed the Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased. There is a 
poignant hush with regard to the particulars of the motive alleged. No 
independent witness was produced by the prosecution to prove the motive as 
alleged. Even otherwise a tainted piece of evidence cannot corroborate another 
tainted piece of evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the 
case of "Muhammad Javed v. The State" (2016 SCMR 2021) as under: 
"The said related and chance witnesses had failed to receive any 
independent corroboration inasmuch as no independent proof of the 
motive set up by the prosecution had been brought on the record of the 
case." 
 
24.       The only other piece of evidence left to be considered by us is the medical 
evidence with regard to the injuries observed on the dead body of the deceased 
by Dr.Qurat-ul-Ain (PW-7)  but the same is of no assistance in this case as 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
38 
 
 
medical evidence by its nature and character, cannot recognize a culprit in case 
of an unobserved incidence. As all the other pieces of evidence relied upon by 
the prosecution in this case have been disbelieved and discarded by us, therefore, 
the appellant's conviction cannot be upheld on the basis of medical evidence 
alone. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled 
"Hashim Qasim and another Vs. The State" (2017 SCMR 986) has enunciated 
the following principle of law:  
"The medical evidence is only confirmatory or of supporting nature and 
is never held to be corroboratory evidence, to identify the culprit."   
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled "Naveed 
Asghar and two others Vs. The State" (P L D 2021 Supreme Court 600) has 
enunciated the following principle of law:  
"31. 
The prosecution has attempted to complete the chain of 
circumstantial evidence by medical evidence relating to the post mortem 
examinations of the deceased persons. This evidence proves only the factum 
that death of the deceased persons was caused by cutting their throats 
through some sharp edge weapon; it does in no way indicate who had cut 
their throats and with what particular weapon. Medical evidence is in the 
nature of supporting, confirmatory or explanatory of the direct or 
circumstantial evidence, and is not "corroborative evidence" in the sense the 
term is used in legal parlance for a piece of evidence that itself also has 
some probative force to connect the accused person with the commission of 
offence. Medical evidence by itself does not throw any light on the identity 
of the offender. Such evidence may confirm the available substantive 
evidence with regard to certain facts including seat of the injury, nature of 
the injury, cause of the death, kind of the weapon used in the occurrence, 
duration between the injuries and the death, and presence of an injured 
witness or the injured accused at the place of occurrence, but it does not 
connect the accused with the commission of the offence. It cannot constitute 
corroboration for proving involvement of the accused person in the 
commission of offence, as it does not establish the identity of the accused 
person.32 Therefore, the medical evidence is of little help to the prosecution 
for bringing home the guilt to the petitioners." 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
39 
 
 
25.      Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in our 
minds regarding the involvement of the appellant namely Muhammad Imran alias 
Aamir son of Hazoor Bakhsh  in the present case. It is a settled principle of law 
that for giving benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there should be so many 
circumstances rather, if only a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in 
the mind of a prudent person is available, then the such benefit is to be extended 
to an accused not as a matter of concession but as of right. The august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of "Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State" (2018 
SCMR 772) has enunciated the following principle: 
"Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an accused 
it is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating 
doubt. If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a 
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be 
entitled to the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and 
concession, but as a matter of right. It is based on the maxim, "it is better 
that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be 
convicted". Reliance in this behalf can be made upon the cases of Tariq 
Pervez v. The State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. 
The State (2008 SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 
SCMR 230) and Muhammad Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749)." 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
"Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State" (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has been as infra: 
"9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is not 
a ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete justice. This 
is an established principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 
guilty persons should let off but one innocent person should not 
suffer. As the preeminent English jurist William Blackstone wrote, 
"Better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer." 
Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of early 
American history, went further arguing "it is better a hundred guilty 
persons should escape than one innocent person should suffer." All 
the contradictions noted by the learned High Court are sufficient to 
cast a shadow of doubt on the prosecution's case, which entitles the 
petitioner to the right of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled 
principle of law that for the accused to be afforded this right of the 
benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there should be many 
circumstances creating uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the 
benefit of the same must got to the petitioner. This Court in the case 
of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the 

Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 
Crl. Appeal No. 462 of 2022 
40 
 
 
the earlier judgments of this Court has categorically held that "if a 
single circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind 
about the apprehension of guilt of an accused, then he/she shall be 
entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace and concession, but 
as of right. Reference in this regard may be made to the cases of Tariq 
Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) and Ayub Masih v. The State 
(PLD 2002 SC 1048)." The same view was reiterated in Abdul Jabbar 
v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court observed that once a single 
loophole is observed in a case presented by the prosecution, such as 
conflict in the ocular account and medical evidence or presence of 
eye-witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of such loophole/lacuna in 
the prosecution's case automatically goes in favour of an accused." 
 
26.  
 For what has been discussed above Criminal Appeal No.462 of 2022 
lodged by Muhammad Imran alias Aamir son of Hazoor Bakhsh  (appellant) is  
allowed and the conviction and sentence of the appellant awarded by the learned 
trial court through the impugned judgment dated 30.06.2022 are hereby set-aside. 
Muhammad Imran alias Aamir son of Hazoor Bakhsh  (appellant) is ordered to 
be acquitted by extending him the benefit of doubt. Muhammad Imran alias 
Aamir son of Hazoor Bakhsh  is in custody and he is directed to be released 
forthwith if not required in any other case. 
 
25. 
Murder Reference No.17 of 2022 is answered in Negative and the 
sentence  of death awarded to Muhammad Imran alias Aamir son of Hazoor 
Bakhsh  is Not Confirmed.
