IN THE LAHORE HIGH COURT

Order with signature of Judge, and that of

Malik Imtiaz Mahmood Awan, Advocate for petitioner.  
Malik Muhammad Khalid Dwanj, Advocate for 
respondent No. 3.  
 
 
  
Through the instant constitutional petition, 
the petitioner challenges the impugned judgment and 
decree dated 22.09.2021 passed by learned Addl. 
District Judge, Bahawalpur, whereby appeal filed by 
the petitioner challenging the decree passed in favour 
of the respondent No. 3 (‘respondent’) in a family suit 
has been dismissed.  
2.    
The grievance of the petitioner is that 
application for permission for production of additional 
evidence filed by the petitioner, reply of which was 
submitted by the respondent on 20.05.2019 remained 
un-decided while passing the impugned judgment and 
decree.  
3.    
Learned counsel for the respondent has 
defended the impugned judgment and decree by stating 
that even if it is assumed that the witness to be 
summoned in the witness box shall support the 
petitioner’s claim and his evidence shall not be 

 
 
    W.P. No. 9272 of 2021/BWP

different from the petitioner, the result of the case 
would not be any different, hence, pendency of the said 
application could not effect the merits of the case and 
prays that the matter may be decided on its own merit 
in accordance with law on the basis of available 
evidence by assuming that evidence of said witnesses 
had been recorded in favour of the petitioner.  
4.    
Heard. Record perused.  
5.   
The contention of the learned counsel for 
respondent that it may be assumed that the witnesses 
required to be produced by the petitioner would support 
the petitioner’s claim in verbatim and treat their 
evidence in his support as having been recorded 
without their evidence being formally recorded is not 
based on any provision of law and such an assumption 
or presumption cannot be drawn by this Court as the 
same may be prejudicial to the rights of either of the 
parties and even otherwise adoption of such procedure 
is not permissible under the law. Moreover, despite the 
fact that the Family Court can adopt any procedure 
which is not against the procedure prescribed by 
Family Court Act, 1964, by treating the same as 
permissible, this Court cannot assume that the said 
application had either been allowed or declined by the 
appellate court or that the witnesses if permitted to be 

 
 
    W.P. No. 9272 of 2021/BWP  
 
 
 
 
3 
 
produced in additional evidence would definitely 
support the claim of the petitioner in verbatim. Besides, 
this Court can only proceed in the matter by observing 
the principle of practice that a thing must be done in the 
manner permitted by law to be done and not otherwise. 
Hence, this Court is not inclined to proceed with the 
matter 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
such 
misconceived 
assumption/presumption of treating the evidence as 
recorded despite the fact that application for seeking 
permission for additional evidence was still undecided.  
6.   
Even otherwise, where an application that 
can affect the merits of the case is left undecided, the 
same causes prejudice to the rights of the parties and in 
that eventuality the court cannot assume that such 
application was dismissed by the Court before which 
the same was pending for the reason that such 
presumption would cause serious prejudice to the 
rights of either of the parties especially the applicant 
and final judgment, if any passed, without decision of 
such like application is not sustainable and the courts 
in such like eventuality have time and again set-aside 
the judgments and remanded the matter for fresh 
decision after deciding the pending applications. 
Reliance in this regard is placed on 2008 SCMR 1326 
(Abdul Ghafoor and another versus Mst. Hassan Bibi 

 
 
    W.P. No. 9272 of 2021/BWP  
 
 
 
 
4 
 
and others), 2008 SCMR 1259 (Mst. Imtiaz Begum 
versus Mst. Sultan Jan and others), NLR 2005 
Criminal 178 (SC) (The State through Deputy 
Prosecutor General, NAB versus Tariq Mohsin and 
others), 2019 CLD 181 (DB). (Shahid Saleem versus 
Bank Alfalah Limited) and 2016 CLD 1741 (Lahore) 
(Iyaz-ul-Haq Chaudhry versus NIB Bank Limited 
through Authorized Attorney and 4 others). 
7.    
In furtherance of what has been discussed 
above, it is settled by now that application for 
permission to allow additional evidence goes to the 
very root of the matter especially when in the present 
case learned counsel for the petitioner states that the 
learned appellate court while dismissing his appeal had 
observed that the petitioner had not led any evidence 
and in this circumstance, it could be not assumed that 
the appellate court while neglecting to decide the 
application for permission to record additional 
evidence had properly exercised its jurisdiction.  
Besides pendency of an undecided application for 
permission to record additional evidence was enough 
to set aside the impugned judgment of the appellate 
court for the reason that the court had failed to exercise 
jurisdiction vested in it and same had caused prejudice 
to the petitioner. Reliance in this regard is placed on 

 
 
    W.P. No. 9272 of 2021/BWP  
 
 
 
 
5 
 
principles laid down in case reported as 2015 CLC 54 
(Sindh) (Mst. Asia Begum and 2 others vs. Muhammad 
Alam and 3 others). 
8.  
In view thereof, without commenting upon 
the other merits of the case, the impugned judgment 
and decree dated 22.09.2021 passed by the learned 
appellate court is set-aside with the result that the 
appeal filed by the petitioner shall be deemed to be 
pending before the appellate court, which after 
affording opportunity of hearing to the parties shall 
decide the application for production of additional 
evidence on its own merits and also the pending appeal, 
expeditiously, preferably within next two month. With 
this observation, the instant constitutional petition is 
disposed of.
