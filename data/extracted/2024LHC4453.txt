Through this petition, Habib ur Rehman petitioner 
seeks pre-arrest bail in case FIR No.519 dated 12.07.2024 
registered for offences under Sections 506(ii) & 34 of 
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, at Police Station Bambanwala, 
District Sialkot. 
2. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
3. 
Perusal of crime report transpires that petitioner 
intercepted Shahid Ali and Imran on their way to home 
and on gunpoint abused and extended them life threats. 
Admittedly, as per contents of crime report though 
petitioner threatened the complainant and the other 
witness yet it is nowhere mentioned therein that the same 
was done with an intent to cause alarm to the witness or to 
cause them to do any act which they are not legally bound 
to do, or not to do any act which they are legally entitled 
to do, as the means of avoiding the execution of such 
threat. Perusal of relevant column of the FIR transpires 
that Section 506(ii) of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, has

been applied against the petitioner while reading of 
Chapter XXII of the Code ibid reveals that Section 506(ii) 
or 506(B) is non-existent. However, with regard to the 
quantum of sentence and the nature of threat, Section 506 
of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, without mentioning any 
first or second part explains to the effect that if the threat 
be to cause death or grievous hurt, or to cause the 
destruction of any property by fire, or to cause an offence 
punishable with death or imprisonment for life, or with 
imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, 
or to impute unchastity to a woman, the offender would be 
punished with imprisonment of either description for a 
term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or 
with both. The earlier part of the same section says as 
under:- 
“whoever 
commits 
the 
offence 
of 
criminal 
intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment 
which may extend to three years or with fine up to 
five hundred thousand rupees or with both.” 
 
While definition of criminal intimidation is provided in 
Section 503 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, that 
goes as under:- 
“Whoever threatens another with an injury to his 
person, reputation or property, or to the person or 
reputation of anyone in whom that person is 
interested, with intent to cause alarm to that person, 
or to cause that person to do any act which he is not 
legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which 
that person is legally entitled to do, as the means of 
avoiding the execution of such threat” 
 
The latter part of the subject provision is the continuity of 
the earlier part and it is not to be read separately. Both

parts are distinguishable with regard to the nature, gravity 
of threat and the quantum of sentence only but the second 
part neither is an independent provision nor it makes a 
threat simplicitor, criminal intimidation. Misconception 
existing and noticed by this Court must be removed as the 
same results in misquoting of a penal provision and wrong 
application of the same. 
4. 
Now coming back to the merits of the case in hand, 
in consideration of mentioned supra, culpability of the 
petitioner for an offence punishable under Section 506 of 
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, yet requires determination by 
the learned trial court which makes this case one of further 
inquiry into petitioner’s guilt entitling him to the grant of 
relief being craved. Petitioner has already joined the 
investigation hence, sending him behind the bars does not 
look justified. Being so, this petition is allowed and 
ad-interim pre-arrest bail already granted to the petitioner 
is confirmed subject to his furnishing fresh bail bonds in 
the sum of Rs.100,000/- with one surety in the like 
amount to the satisfaction of learned trial court. 
5. 
Copy of this order be sent to the Inspector General 
of Police, Punjab, and the Prosecutor General, Punjab. 
Signed on 22.10.2024.
