Concurrent decisions by the Member, 
National Industrial Relations Commission (NIRC) and 
National Industrial Relations Commission Full Bench 
dated 30.09.2022 and 10.01.2024, respectively, are 
subject 
matter 
of 
challenge 
through 
instant 
constitutional petition. 
2. Legal question raised for determination is whether 
petitioner, which was registered under Section 42 of 
erstwhile Companies Ordinance, 1984 and a non-profit 
organization (‘NPO’), falls within the definition of the 
expression(s) 
“commercial 
establishment” 
or 
“industrial establishment” under the provisions of The 
Industrial and Commercial Employment (Standing 
Order) Ordinance 1968.  
Status of the petitioner entity as Guarantee 
Company, incorporated under section 42 of the 
Companies Ordinance 1984 and classification as NPO 
is not disputed. In support of submissions, learned 
counsel for the petitioner cites the case of “Syed 
Shahid Abbas and 36 others vs. Chenab Club 

2 
 
W.P. No.2212 of 2024 
 
 
(Guarantee) Limited Faisalabad through President 
and another” (2008 PLC 58). 
3. Conversely, 
learned 
counsel 
appearing 
for 
respondent No.3 submits that petitioner is a trans-
provincial establishment and jurisdiction to try 
industrial disputes is exclusively vested with NIRC, 
which jurisdiction is conferred and exercisable in terms 
of the provisions of Industrial Relations Act 2012 (Act, 
2012), which has an overriding effect under section 87 
of the Act, 2012. 
4. Heard. 
5. Petitioner is a trans-provincial establishment, 
which is covered under the provisions of Act, 2012. It 
is evident that initially grievance petition was 
submitted under section 46 of the Industrial Relations 
Ordinance, 2002, wherein claim of respondent No.3 
was allowed by the Labour Court No.9 on 14.03.2011, 
which matter went to Labour Appellate Tribunal and in 
the meanwhile Act, 2012 was promulgated; whereupon 
appeals were transferred to NIRC Full-Bench, which 
set-aside the judgment of the Labour Court and 
remanded the matter to Member, NIRC. Question of 
non-application of Standing Order 1968 was raised but 
dismissed by Member NIRC and NIRC Full Bench. 
6. Following are determinable questions; whether 
petitioner comes within the definition of establishment 
– section 2 (x) of Act, 2012 -; whether grievance raised 
is covered under the expression ‘industrial dispute’ 
whether respondent No.3 qualifies as worker or 
workman, either under Act, 2012 or in terms of 
Standing Order 1968. And if all these requirements are 
met then assumption and exercise of jurisdiction by 
NIRC under the provisions of the Act, 2012 

3 
 
W.P. No.2212 of 2024 
 
 
tantamount 
to 
lawful 
exercise 
of 
authority 
/ 
jurisdiction. For better understanding of the triable 
questions, it is expedient to reproduce relevant 
provisions of Act, 2012 and Standing Order 1968, 
which read as, 
(x) 
“establishment” means any office, 
firm, 
factory, 
society, 
undertaking, 
company, shop or enterprise, which employs 
workmen directly or through contractor for 
the purpose of carrying on any business or 
industry and includes all its departments 
and branches in the Islamabad Capital 
Territory or falling in more than one 
province, whether situated in the same place 
or in different places and except in section 
62 includes a collective bargaining unit, if 
any, constituted by any establishment or 
group of establishment.  
(xvi)  “industrial 
dispute” 
means 
any 
dispute or difference between employees 
and employers or between employers and 
workmen 
or 
between 
workmen 
and 
workmen which is connected with the 
employment or non-employment or the 
terms of employment or the conditions of 
work of any person; 
(xxxiii) 
“workers” 
and 
“workman” 
mean person not falling within the definition 
of employer who is employed (including 
employment as a supervisor or as an 
apprentice) in an establishment or industry 
for hire or reward either directly or through 
a 
contractor 
whether 
the 
terms 
of 

4 
 
W.P. No.2212 of 2024 
 
 
employment are express or implied, and, for 
the purpose of any proceeding; under this 
Act in relation to an industrial dispute 
includes a person who has been dismissed, 
discharged, retrenched, laid-off or otherwise 
removed from employment in connection 
with or as a consequence of that dispute or 
whose dismissal discharge, retrenchment 
lay-off, or removal has led to that dispute 
but does not include any person who is 
employed 
mainly 
in 
managerial 
or 
administrative capacity. 
Definition of workman under Standing 
Order 1968.  
(i)  
“workman” 
means 
any 
person 
employed in any industrial or commercial 
establishment to do any skilled or unskilled, 
manual or clerical [work] for hire or 
reward. 
 [Emphasis supplied] 
7. Upon perusal of the quoted provisions of law, I 
find no difficulty in holding that petitioner qualifies as 
an ‘establishment’ in terms of section 2 (x) of the Act, 
2012, which inter alia includes a company, that had 
employed a workman, i.e., respondent No.3 and for 
carrying on business, which nature of business is 
distinguishable from the industry. Respondent No.3 
was dismissed, whose individual grievance comes 
within the ambit of an industrial dispute, in terms of 
section 2 (xvi) – inter alia a dispute between employer 
and workmen and connected with the employment or 
otherwise concerning the terms and conditions of 
employment. Further, respondent No.3 comes within 

5 
 
W.P. No.2212 of 2024 
 
 
the definition of workman under section 2 (xxxiii) of 
the Act, 2012, - [respondent No.3 was not employed to 
conduct managerial or administrative assignment], who 
was dismissed in relation to an industrial dispute, 
hence, entitled to bring his grievance within the ambit 
of Act, 2012. Designation of the petitioner was office 
attendant / Telephone Operator – which is covered 
under specification of skilled or unskilled workman – 
which comes within the definition of workman in 
terms of clause (i) of section 2 of the Standing Order 
1968, as well. 
  
Any doubt or confusion, if any, stood settled in 
terms of the ratio settled in the case of “Messrs Pak 
Telecom Mobile Limited vs. Muhammad Atif Bilal and 
2 others” (2024 PLC 130), which illustrates that for 
the purposes of seeking remedy under Standing Order 
or Act, 2012, grievance-raiser had to satisfy his 
qualification under definition of workmen under 
relevant statute. It is not disputed that respondent No.3 
meets the definition of workman under the Act, 2012 
and Standing Order 1968 and there appears no 
apparent conflict qua assumption and exercise of 
jurisdiction – petitioner being a trans-provincial 
establishment. Questions raised have been addressed 
by the forums competent to exercise jurisdiction – 
reasoning may not be eloquently laid but sound enough 
to affirm it. The case of Chenab Club (Guarantee) 
Limited Faisalabad through President and another 
(supra) is not applicable, which decision was made in 
terms of section 25-A of the Industrial Relations 
Ordinance 1969, wherein requisite amendment was 
made in Standing order 1968 to provide remedy of 
invoking jurisdiction in terms of the mechanism 
provided under Industrial Relations Ordinance 1969. 

6 
 
W.P. No.2212 of 2024 
 
 
The case of Fauji Foundation (Headquarters) through 
Manager Administration vs. Punjab Labour Appellate 
Tribunal and 2 others (2007 SCMR 1346) extends no 
support, 
which 
relates 
to 
Industrial 
Relations 
Ordinance, 1969. 
8. There is another aspect of the matter. Petitioner 
may not qualify as a ‘commercial establishment’ for 
the purposes of Standing Order 1968, but comes within 
an ambit of establishment under the Act, 2012, which 
might not be a ground for dismissing claim of 
respondent No.3 in wake of section 87 of the Act, 
2012, which extends an overriding effect to the Act, 
2012.   
9. In view of the above, question is answered by 
affirming the decisions assailed and holding that 
petitioner is an establishment under section 2 (x) of the 
Act, 2012.  
10. Constitutional petition is found meritless and same 
is, hereby, dismissed.
