2.  
Per prosecution, the facts of the case, as disclosed by Rab 
Nawaz, complainant in his complaint (Exh-PC) on the basis of which 
formal crime report (Exh-PC/1) was registered, are that on 
28.04.2013 at 12.30 a.m, he along with his nephew Hashim was 
present in his cattle shed and were having chit chat. Emergency light 
and lantern were lit when six unknown accused persons armed with 
firearms came there, apprehended them and took them towards south 
west where, three motorcycles were parked. The accused persons 
forcibly made his nephew Muhammad Hashim sit on the motorcycle 
and abducted him. 
3. 
Mullazim Hussain and Muhammad Tariq, appellants were 
arrested on 29.09.2013 in this case by Muhammad Amin, Inspector, 
(PW-9). Mullazim Hussain, appellant, on 24.10.2013, while in police 
custody, after making disclosure, got recovered tractor bearing 
registration No.DIK-7313 (P-1) which was taken into possession 
vide recovery memo Exh-PD. He, on 28.10.2013, also got recovered 
.30 bore pistol (P-4) along with four live bullets (P-5/1-4) which was 
also taken into possession vide recovery memo Exh-PF whereas, 
Muhammad Tariq, appellant, on 28.10.2013, while in custody, after 
making disclosure, got recovered .30 bore pistol (P-2) along with 
five live bullets (P-3/1-5) which were taken into possession vide 
recovery memo Exh-PE. He, on 29.10.2013, also got recovered 
Rs.2,50,000/- (P-6/1-250), taken into possession vide recovery 
memo Exh-PG. After completion of investigation, report under 
Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted. 
The learned trial court, after observing pre-trial codal formalities, 
framed the charge against the appellants on 23.01.2014 to which they 
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 
4. 
The prosecution, in order to prove its case, produced as many 
as nine witnesses during the trial. Sheikh Fayyaz Hussain, learned 

Crl. Appeal No.1518 of 2014

Judicial Magistrate (PW-1) conducted the test identification parade 
of the appellants. Rab Nawaz (PW-2) is the complainant of the case. 
Muhammad Hashim (PW-8) is the abductee whereas, Ahmad Nawaz 
(PW-3) is the witness of payment of ransom amount to the 
appellants. Abdul Sattar, SI (PW-4), on receipt of complaint (Exh-
PC) drafted formal crime report (Exh-PC/1) without any addition or 
omission on his part. Ghulam Abbas, SI (PW-5) and Muhammad 
Amin, Inspector (PW-9) are the investigation officers of this case 
whereas, rest of the witnesses are formal in nature. The learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General after giving up Sultan PW, closed the 
prosecution evidence. 
5. 
The statements of the appellants under Section 342 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, were recorded wherein, they 
refuted the allegations levelled against them and professed their 
innocence. They further maintained that they had falsely been 
implicated in this case due to their political rivalry with one Nazar 
Abbas. They neither opted to appear as their own witness on oath as 
provided under Section 340(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 in disproof of the allegations levelled against them nor did they 
produce evidence in their defence.  
6. 
The learned trial Court vide its judgment dated 15.07.2014, 
found the appellants guilty, convicted and sentenced them as 
mentioned above. 
7. 
We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the 
appellants, learned counsel for the complainant, learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General and also scanned the available record with their 
assistance. 
8. 
According to the prosecution’s case narrated in the crime 
report as well as canvassed by complainant Rab Nawaz (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Hashim, the alleged abductee (PW-8), the occurrence of 
this case took place on 28.04.2013 in the night at 12.30 a.m. by six 
unknown culprits who were armed with firearms when they were 
sleeping in their cattle shed. Per the stance of PW-2, he saw the 

Crl. Appeal No.1518 of 2014 
4
culprits in the light of lantern as well as the emergency light 
available in the shed but both sources of light were neither taken into 
possession by the investigation agency nor produced before the 
learned trial court. Even Ghulam Abbas, SI (PW-5), the investigation 
officer, during his cross examination, admits that no source of light 
at the place of occurrence has been shown in the rough site plan.  
A very strange and unusual aspect of this case noticed by us is 
that abductee Muhammad Hashim (PW-8) purportedly remained in 
detention of his abductors for a period of about four months and they 
had been telephonically calling the complainant party to demand the 
ransom but as per complainant (PW-2), he did not remember the 
caller’s telephone number and he did not give the same to police 
prior or post return of the abductee. Ahmad Nawaz (PW-3) has given 
the cell Phone No.0321-7783385 statedly owned by his maternal 
cousin Sabir on which the abductors made calls for the purpose of 
demanding ransom but admittedly, said Sabir neither joined the 
investigation nor is the PW in this case and more interestingly, the 
Call Data Record of his number has not even been produced in 
evidence. The two telephone numbers mentioned in his statement by 
PW-5 Ghulam Abbas, SI who investigated this case for a certain 
period are 928210952 and 928211289. He also mentioned a caller’s 
Cell Phone No.0311-9096019 but admits that till the investigation 
remained with him, no Call Data Record of said three phone 
numbers could be brought on record. However, he admits that 
according to the record, Cell Phone No.0311-9096019 was found 
registered in the name of Fazal ur Rehman son of Abdullah Jan 
resident of Ranwal Tehsil and District Tank whose copy of 
Computerized National Identity Card was also procured on record 
but he also concedes that the said Fazal ur Rehman is neither the PW 
nor the accused in this case. The perusal of whole evidence produced 
by the prosecution makes it clear that the appellants are not 
connected with any of the telephone numbers used by the culprits to 
demand the ransom amount from the complainant party. It is also to 
be kept in mind that the Cell Phone Q-Mobile and two SIM cards of 
Muhammad Hashim, the alleged abductee (PW-8) could not be 

Crl. Appeal No.1518 of 2014 
5
recovered from the possession of the appellants. Likewise, 
Muhammad Hashim (PW-8), the alleged abductee was not recovered 
from the custody of the appellants. Moreover, it is the case of the 
prosecution that Muhammad Hashim (PW-8), the alleged abductee 
returned on 12.08.2013 but admittedly, he got his statement recorded 
to police not earlier to 17.08.2013 but no plausible explanation is 
rendered by the prosecution as to why his statement was recorded 
with such a delay and also that why he was not got medico legally 
examined. Similarly, the motorcycles used by the appellants for the 
purpose of abduction and the motorcycle allegedly used by these 
appellants to come to the place where they allegedly received the 
ransom amount from Ahmad Nawaz (PW-3) and Sultan (given up 
PW), could not be recovered from their possession during their 
extensive physical custody with the investigation agency. It has also 
been noticed that the investigation agency even remained fail to have 
disclosure from the appellants about the place where the abductee 
Muhammad Hashim (PW-8) remained confined for a period of about 
four months. 
9. 
Ghulam Abbas, SI (PW-5), during his cross examination, 
admits that regarding the occurrence, rough site plan having rough 
notes (Exh-DB) is available on record and that Exh-DB carries the 
date of 28.04.2013 and according to the same, twelve foot molds 
related to six persons were also secured. But, the prosecution case is 
silent about the use of said foot molds taken from the relevant place 
on the day of occurrence i.e. on 28.04.2013 and in such situation 
inference is to be drawn against the credibility of prosecution case 
under Article 129 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. This also 
transpires that application Exh-PC actually was not the first 
information received by the police. At this stage, it is also to be kept 
into consideration that as per prosecution’s case, the complainant 
(PW-2), for the first time, reported the matter to the police on 
30.04.2013 through a written application (Exh-PC).  
10. 
So far as the identification of the appellants, during the test 
identification parade, held on 07.10.2013 by Sheikh Fayyaz Hussain, 

Crl. Appeal No.1518 of 2014 
6
learned Judicial Magistrate (PW-1) is concerned, it has been noticed 
that admittedly, the age of the dummies is not given in the 
identification parade proceedings and similarly, both the appellants 
were subjected to the test identification parade jointly. Learned 
Judicial Magistrate (PW-1), during his cross examination, admits 
that no role was assigned to the appellants by the witnesses during 
the identification parade. He also candidly concedes that he did not 
resolve the objection raised by the appellants during their 
identification parade. We have also noticed that according to the 
statement of Muhammad Amin, Inspector (PW-9), he arrested 
Mullazim Hussain, appellant on 29.09.2013 and Muhammad Tariq, 
appellant, on the disclosure of Mullazim Hussain, appellant on the 
same day when Mullazim Hussain, appellant was in custody of 
Muhammad Amin, SI of the same police station in connection with 
another case FIR No.129/2013 registered at the same police station 
under Section 9(b) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997. 
He also admits that as per extract given in the record of this case, the 
said case was registered on 09.09.2013. The investigation officer 
(PW-9) also remained confused regarding the date of sending both 
the appellants in judicial custody for the purpose of their 
identification parade as during his examination in chief, he maintains 
that they were arrested on 29.09.2013 upon the disclosure of 
Mullazim Hussain, appellant and they were sent to judicial custody 
on 30.09.2013 which shows that both the appellants remained in 
police station for a day but during his cross examination, he took a 
somersault and maintains that appellant Mullazim Hussain was sent 
on judicial remand on the same day i.e. on 29.09.2013. In this view 
of the matter, the credibility of the test identification parade of both 
the appellants becomes doubtful. 
11. 
As regards the recovery of .30 bore pistols (P-2 & P-4) along 
with live bullets (P-3/1-5 & P-5/1-4) allegedly made at the instance 
of the Muhammad Tariq and Mullazim Hussain, appellants, 
respectively, the same were recovered from the ‘Dera’ of one Haq 
Nawaz Sial, never joined with the proceedings of this case, hence, 

Crl. Appeal No.1518 of 2014 
7
the said recovery does not carry any judicial certainty. As far as the 
recovery of tractor (P-1) is concerned, it is established on record that 
the same is owned by one Allah Ditta Usmani, brother in law of 
appellant Mullazim Hussain. Though, the investigation officer 
claims that the tractor was got transferred in the name of said Allah 
Ditta Usmani subsequently, yet Muhammad Amin, Inspector (PW-9) 
admits that no record of concerned office is available on record to 
prove the same. Similarly, it is not denied that the original owner 
from whom Mullazim Hussain, appellant or Allah Ditta Usmani 
purchased the tractor was never joined with the investigation and 
likewise, he has not been produced before the learned trial court to 
establish the case against Mullazim Hussain, appellant to the effect 
that the said tractor was purchased by him by using his share from 
the ransom money collected from the complainant party. Similarly, 
when we come to the recovery of cash amount of Rs.2,50,000/- from 
Muhammad Tariq, appellant, the prosecution case is silent about the 
detailed use of remaining Rs.3,00,000/- and further investigation in 
this regard. Another important fact regarding the recoveries from 
Muhammad Tariq and Mullazim Hussain, appellants is that the 
recovery witness Ahmad Nawaz (PW-3), during his cross 
examination, in very clear terms, maintains that he had been giving 
statements in connection with this case but has never signed any 
document that renders the credibility of recovery memos Exh-PD, 
Exh-PE, Exh-PF and Exh-PG seriously doubtful. 
12. 
Now coming to the abscondance of the appellants, keeping in 
view our supra mentioned observations, we are of the opinion that an 
accused cannot be convicted on the basis of his alleged abscondence 
only when otherwise direct evidence produced by the prosecution 
against him is not sufficient to hold him guilty. 
13. 
Taking stock of whole supra discussion, we have come to an 
irresistible conclusion that the prosecution remained fail to prove its 
case against the appellants beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt. 
There remains no cavil about the proposition that if there is a single 
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt regarding the 

Crl. Appeal No.1518 of 2014 
8
prosecution case, the same is sufficient to give benefit of the same to 
the accused, whereas, in the instant case we have observed many, 
discussed supra.  
14. 
In the light of above discussion, we accept Criminal Appeal 
No.1518 of 2014 filed by Mullazim Hussain and Muhammad Tariq 
(appellants), set aside their convictions and sentences recorded by 
the learned trial court and acquit them of the charge levelled against 
them by extending them the benefit of doubt. They are in custody, be 
released forthwith if not required to be detained in any other criminal 
case.
