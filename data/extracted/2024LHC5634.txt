Brief facts of the case, as disclosed by Muhammad

Crl. Appeal No.41759 of 2022

the basis of which formal crime report (Exh-PC) was registered, 
are that on 28.06.2020 at about 02.00 p.m, when the 
complainant was out of city in connection with some urgent 
work, the appellant while armed with weapon entered into his 
house, locked his children into a room on gun point and 
committed rape with his wife Mst. Shumaila Shahzad. He also 
took pictures and made video of his wife in naked condition 
through mobile. He also extended threats to upload the pictures 
and video if the complainant did not effect compromise in the 
earlier case. 
3. 
After completion of investigation, report under Section 
173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted. 
The learned trial court, after observing pre-trial codal 
formalities, framed the charge against the appellant to which he 
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 
4. 
The prosecution, in order to prove its case, produced as 
many as five witnesses during the trial. Tariq Mahmood 436/C 
(PW-1) is the witness of recovery of mobile phone along with 
memory card which was taken into possession vide recovery 
memo Exh-PA. Muhammad Shahzad (PW-2) is the complainant 
whereas, Mst. Shumaila Shahzad (PW-3) is the victim of the 
case. Saif Ullah, ASI (PW-4) is the duty officer who, on receipt 
of complaint (Exh-PB) registered FIR (Exh-PC) without any 
addition or omission whereas, Muhammad Javed, ASI (PW-5) is 
the Investigation Officer of the case. Learned Deputy District 
Public Prosecutor, on the instructions of complainant as well as 
his learned counsel, gave up Allah Ditta and Rashid PWs being 
unnecessary and after tendering in evidence Audio Visual 
Analysis Report (Exh-PH) close the prosecution case. 
5. 
Thereafter, statement of the appellant under Section 342 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was recorded wherein, 
he refuted the allegations levelled against him and professed his 

Crl. Appeal No.41759 of 2022

innocence. He further deposed that he was innocent and had 
wrongly been involved in this case. He further deposed that he 
used to visit house of complainant and the victim being his close 
relative and that the complainant was his business partner and 
due to some business dispute between them, the complaint got 
registered a false FIR against him by introducing his wife as 
fake victim just to usurp his amount. He also disclosed that there 
was no evidence and that the investigation was biased as all the 
proceedings conducted by the police were false and fictitious. 
He did not opt to appear as his own witness as provided under 
Section 340(2) of the Code of the Criminal Procedure, 1898 in 
disproof of the allegation levelled against him however, he did 
produce his nine snaps (Exh-DA/1-8) with victim of this case in 
his defence. 
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
7. 
It has straightaway been observed that according to 
prosecution‟s case against Rizwan Sami Khan, appellant, he on 
gun point, forcibly raped Mst. Shumaila Shahzad (PW-3) wife 
of Muhammad Shahzad, complainant (PW-2) but during the 
physical custody of the appellant with the Investigation Agency, 
no gun could be recovered at his instance. The inmates of the 
house who were locked in a room on gun point, as per contents 
of the FIR, were not produced by the prosecution before the 
Investigation Officer (PW-5) and similarly, they did not join the 
proceedings of trial as witnesses. Meaning thereby, the natural 
witnesses were withheld by the prosecution. PW-2, PW-3 and 
the Investigation officer (PW-5) are also inconsistent qua the 
age of eldest son of the victim. Though during physical custody 
of appellant memory card was taken into possession by the 
Investigation Officer through recovery memo Exh-PA yet the 
fact also remains that during the evidence rendered by the 
Investigation Officer (PW-5) and Tariq Mahmood 436/C (PW-

1), the recovery witness, the memory card and the nude pictures 
were not produced in the court because of which the same could 
not be exhibited in evidence. Similarly, though report of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (Exh-PH) regarding the non editing of 
contents available in memory card is available in evidence yet 
prosecution failed to produce Moharrer of police station who 
per the Investigation Officer (PW-5) was given the sealed parcel 
containing memory card and naked photographs for safe 
custody in „Malkhana‟ on 14.07.2020 and the Moharrer 
returned the same to him on 23.07.2020 for its transmission to 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency. Thus prosecution remained 
fail to prove safe custody of the case property that even 
otherwise could not be produced in evidence. PW-1, the 
recovery witness also admits, during cross examination that the 
memory card and the photographs were not available on judicial 
or police file. Giving Number/description of memory card in his 
examination in chief, he mentioned “highfast MMA/2AL8-GB 
07/2019” which reflects that the content pertains to the year 
2019.  The Investigation Officer (PW-5) also confirmed this fact 
in his statement while per prosecution case subject occurrence 
took place during the year 2020. It is also relevant to mention 
here that Mst. Shumaila Shahzad, victim (PW-3) never got 
herself medico legally examined to substantiate the charge 
against the appellant. Similarly, though the Investigation Officer 
(PW-5), in his statement, stated that he got the appellant 
examined for potency yet admittedly neither any medico legal 
examination certificate/report is available on record nor the 
prosecution produced any Medical Officer in this regard. Proof 
of potency of the appellant/accused in a case of sodomy etc. is a 
requirement to be met with. For this reason the legislature 
inserted Section 53-A in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
through Criminal Law Amendment Act XLIV of 2016 that for 
reference and convenience is reproduced hereunder: - 

Crl. Appeal No.41759 of 2022

“[53-A. Examination of person accused of rape, etc. by 
medical practitioner.—(1) When a person is arrested on 
a charge of committing an offence of rape, unnatural 
offence or sexual abuse or an attempt to commit rape, 
unnatural offence or sexual abuse under section 376, 
section 377 and section 377-B respectively and there are 
reasonable grounds for believing that an examination of 
the arrested person will afford evidence as to the 
commission of such offence, it shall be lawful for a 
registered medical practitioner employed in a hospital run 
by the Government or by a local authority to make such 
an examination of the arrested person and to use such 
force as is reasonably necessary for that purpose. 
 
(2) The registered medical practitioner conducting 
examination under sub-section (1) shall, without delay, 
examine such person and prepare a report of his 
examination giving the following particulars, namely: -- 
 
(a) name and address of the accused and of the 
person by whom he was brought; 
 
(b) age of the accused; 
 
(c) marks of injury, if any, on person of the accused; 
(d) description  of  material  taken  from  person  of     
     accused for DNA profiling; and 
(e) other material particulars in reasonable detail. 
(3) The report under sub-section (2) shall state precisely 
the reasons for each conclusion arrived at. 
(4) The exact time of commencement and completion of 
the examination under sub-section (1) shall also be noted 
in the report under sub-section (2). The registered medical 
practitioner shall, without delay, forward the report to the 
investigating officer who shall forward it to the Magistrate 
through public prosecutor referred to in section 173 as 
part of the report referred to in that section]” 
This provision highlights the relevance and significance of 
potency test of the accused of sexual offences punishable under 
Sections 376, 377 and 377-B, PPC while in the instant case the 
prosecution has not bothered to procure and bring such material 
piece of evidence on record. Consequently, the appellant was 
then potent and able to perpetrate the offence as alleged is a fact

that could not be established by the prosecution during trial that 
creates serious doubt about the prosecution case. 
 
All these circumstances lead this Court to hold that the 
prosecution remained fail to prove its case against the appellant 
beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt. Even otherwise, both, 
complainant (PW-2) and the victim (PW-3) present in Court, 
one by one, stated that they do not have any objection if the 
appellant is acquitted of the charge hence, Crl. Appeal 
No.41759 of 2022 filed by Rizwan Sami Khan, appellant is 
allowed, his convictions and sentences are set aside and he is 
acquitted of the charge levelled against him by giving him 
benefit of doubt. He is in custody, be released forthwith if not 
required to be detained in any other case.
