Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – On 11.11.2022, Irfan Ilyas 
(the “Complainant”) filed a written complaint with the SHO, Police 
Station City Wazirabad, stating that the Qadianis had built a worship 
place near Hakim Bakers in Moti Bazar consisting of a room with a 
minaret, which is an architectural feature and a religious symbol 
important to Islam. According to him, it was an insult to the religious 
feelings of the Muslim population of the locality and a perpetual 
source of pain and anguish for them. Since the Petitioners were 
managing the affairs of that worship place, they were liable under the 
law. Based on this complaint, the SHO registered FIR No.699/2022 
dated 11.11.2022 against the Petitioners for offences under sections 
298-B and 298-C of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1908 (PPC). The 
Petitioners have applied for pre-arrest bail in that case by this 
application under section 498 Cr.P.C. 
2. 
 
The learned counsel for the Petitioners contends that the 
contents of FIR No.699/2022 supra do not constitute any offence 
under the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, including sections 298-B and 
298-C. He further submits that the worship site (known as Bait-ul-
Zikar) was constructed in 1922, while sections 298-B and 298-C were 
inserted in the Penal Code through Ordinance XX of 1984. The 
Petitioners are just the members of the Management Committee of 
Bait-ul-Zikar. Even if constructing a mosque-like structure is illegal, 

Crl. Misc. No.5151/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
 
they cannot be prosecuted on the facts of the instant case. Sections 
295-B and 295-C PPC do not apply retroactively. 
3. 
 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the 
Complainant’s counsel have vehemently opposed this application. 
They contend that it is illegal for Qadianis to build their place of 
worship in the traditional Muslim mosque style. Even though Bait-ul-
Zikar was established in 1922, the Petitioners were obligated to 
change its outlook and pull down the minaret, which is identified with 
a Muslim mosque, following the promulgation of Ordinance XX of 
1984. Since this has not been done, it constitutes a continuing offence 
and the Petitioners, as the current custodians, can be prosecuted. 
4. 
 
In rebuttal, the Petitioners’ counsel submits that there is 
no allegation in the FIR that the Petitioners have ever posed 
themselves as Muslims or called the disputed place of worship a 
Masjid (mosque). The words “Bait-ul-Zikar” have been clearly 
written in Urdu at its main entrance, so no Muslim mistakenly takes it 
as a mosque. 
5. 
 
I have heard the learned counsel and gone through the 
record. In Zaheeruddin and others v. The State and others  
(1993 SCMR 1718), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held that sections 
298-B and 298-C PPC, which were enacted by Ordinance XX of 
1984, are intra vires the Constitution of 1973 and do not offend 
Article 20 thereof. In this case, the primary question that requires 
consideration is whether the contents of the FIR and the evidence 
gathered during the investigation attract sections 298-B and 298-C 
PPC. 
6. 
 
The Complainant has lodged FIR No.699/2022 under 
sections 298-B and 298-C PPC. Section 298-B forbids the members of 
the Qadiani Group or the Lahori Group (who call themselves 
Ahmadis) from using epithets, descriptions and titles designated for 
certain holy personages. It also prohibits them from referring to, 
naming or calling their place of worship as Masjid, or by oral or 
written words or by visible representation referring to the call to 
prayers as “Azan” or reciting it like Muslims. Section 298-C 
criminalizes public propagation of the Qadiani/Ahmadi religion by 

Crl. Misc. No.5151/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
 
any member of that community posing himself as Muslim or referring 
to his faith as Islam, thereby outraging the religious sensitivities of 
Muslims.  
7. 
 
There are two reported cases which considered the 
application of sections 298-B and 298-C PPC where Qadianis were 
arrested for designing their worship place resembling a mosque. The 
decisions, however, are inconsistent. In Muhammad Aslam v. The 
State (1998 PCr.LJ 522), the accused, who were Qadianis, were 
booked under sections 298-B & 295-C PPC for inscribing Kalima 
Tayyaba and Quranic Verses on the walls of their prayer place. It was 
argued that the mosque-like design of the Qadianis’ place of worship 
tends to deceive the general body of the Muslims. This Court held: 
“This statement, however, seems to have little substance, the reason 
being that Qadianis seldom conceal the identity of their worship place, 
and it is publicly known to all those around that a particular place is 
the centre of worship of the Qadianis and not that of the Muslims, 
called a mosque in its familiar term. No question of the Muslims 
falling prey to any confusion about the identity of such a building 
arises.” As a result, the Court admitted the accused to post-arrest bail. 
In Ata Ullah v. The State (PLD 2000 Lahore 364), the accused, a 
Qadiani, had constructed a worship place with minarets, arches 
(Mehrab) and a crest, similar to what the Muslims have for their 
mosques but had inscribed the words “Baitul Ahmedia” at its main 
gate. Police searched the building, recovered several books of the 
Qadiani religion and the Holy Quran, and booked them under sections 
298-B and 298-C PPC. The Court held that by erecting minarets, 
arches, and a crest, the accused made visible representation to the 
public that the building in question was a Muslim mosque, which is 
culpable under section 298-B(1)(d) PPC. Writing “Baitul Ahmadia” 
atop the entrance would not absolve him of the charge. The Court 
observed that the said writing does not completely exclude the 
possibility of deception of Muslims because illiterate people cannot 
read those words, while others may not either notice them or 
understand their significance. Regarding section 298-C PPC, the 
Court stated that it was also attracted prima facie because the accused 
had harmed the sensibilities of Muslims by erecting a structure that 

Crl. Misc. No.5151/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
 
looked like a typical Muslim mosque. The Court declined the 
accused’s application for post-arrest bail. 
8. 
 
It is settled law that when there are conflicting views of 
two Benches of equal strength, the matter should be referred to a 
larger Bench. I would have followed that path in the normal course, 
but this case has a distinguishing feature. Admittedly, Bait-ul-Zikar, 
the subject of FIR No.699/2022, was constructed in 1922, when the 
Petitioners were not even born. The prosecution invokes the doctrine 
of continuing offence to hold them liable.  
9. 
 
Black’s Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition (Special Deluxe) 
states: 
“Continuing” means enduring, not terminated by a single act or 
fact; subsisting for a definite period or intended to cover or apply 
to successive similar obligations or occurrences. “Continuing 
offence” means the type of crime which is committed over a span 
of time. As to the period of the statute of limitation in a continuing 
offence, the last act of the offence controls for the commencement 
of the period. A “continuing offence” may consist of separate acts 
or a course of conduct but which arises from that singleness of 
thought, purpose or action which may be deemed a single impulse. 
A “continuous crime” consists of a continuous series of acts which 
endures after the period of consummation, such as, the offence of 
carrying concealed weapons. In the case of “instantaneous crimes”, 
the statute of limitation begins to run with the consummation. In 
contrast, in the case of continuous crimes, it only begins with the 
cessation of the criminal conduct or act.”1 
10. 
 
A research article defines “continuous crime” as that 
specific form of legal unity of offence in which a crime is committed 
through multiple actions or inactions at different times based on a 
unique criminal intent and against a unique passive subject.2 Thus, to 
qualify as a continuous offence, a penal act must meet the following 
conditions: “the presence of a unit of a passive subject, the unit of an 
active subject, the performance of multiple actions or inactions that 
represent the contents of the same crime, at different periods of time 
and, last but not least, the condition that these actions or inactions be 
performed with a unique criminal intent ... The continuous form of 
legal unity of offence necessitates thoroughly examining each element 
of its content as a whole (as a unique crime) and of every deed that

enters into its composition (as the plurality of acts).”3 The scholar 
further states that the causal relationship must be proven or follow 
from the very materiality of the deed, depending on the classification 
of the crime into one of the categories: material and formal crimes; or 
crimes of danger and violence. 
11. 
 
Let’s examine some judicial decisions to see how the 
courts have dealt with the concept of a continuing offence. In 
Balkrishna 
Savalram 
Pujari 
and 
others 
v. 
Dnyaneshwar 
Maharajsansthan and others (AIR 1959 SC 798), the Supreme Court 
of India observed that a continuing offence is an act which creates a 
continuing source of injury and holds the perpetrator liable for the 
continuation of that injury. If a wrongful act causes an injury which is 
complete, there is no continuing wrong even though the damage 
resulting from the offending act continues. If the wrongful act is of 
such a kind that the injury caused by it continues, then the said act 
constitutes a continuing wrong. As a result, the distinction between 
the two wrongs depends upon the effect of the injury. In State of 
Bihar v. Deokaran Nenshi [(1972) 2 SCC 890 : AIR 1973 SC 908], 
the Supreme Court held that a continuing offence is distinguishable 
from the one committed once and for all because it is susceptible to 
continuance. It results from a failure to obey or comply with a rule or 
its requirement. It entails a punishment, the liability for which 
continues until the rule is obeyed or complied with. The offence is 
committed each time such disobedience or non-compliance happens. 
The element of continuity is lacking in an offence that occurs when an 
act or omission is committed once and for all. In Bhagirath Kanoria 
and others v. State of M.P. (AIR 1984 SC 1688), the Supreme Court 
stated that a continuing offence does not have a fixed connotation and 
added that the question of whether a particular offence is a continuing 
offence must necessarily depend upon the language of the statute 
which creates that offence, the nature of the offence and, most 
importantly, the purpose which is intended to be achieved by 
designating the specific act as an offence. In Udai Shankar Awasthi 
v. State of U.P. [2013 (2) SCC 435], the Supreme Court observed that 
                                                 
3 ibid. 

Crl. Misc. No.5151/B/2023

the term “continuing offence” is not defined in the Indian Code of 
Criminal Procedure because it cannot be given a fixed meaning. The 
Court held that for a continuing offence to take place, the ingredients 
of the crime must persist even after the period of consummation. In 
Trilok Chand v. C.N. Srivastava and others (AIR 1961 All. 88), the 
High Court stated that “continuing offence” continues from moment 
to moment without interruption or break. The phrase “continuing 
offence” should be understood in the same way as  “continuing breach 
of contract” and “continuing the wrong independent of contract” in 
section 23 of the Limitation Act, 1908. 
12. 
 
In Amir Khan v. The State (PLD 1963 Dacca 92), a Full 
Bench of the Dacca High Court explained that the expression “when 
an offence is a continuing one” does not mean that a new offence is 
committed every day. The phrase means “when the same offence is 
continued.” For example, in dishonestly retaining stolen property 
(section 411 PPC), the same offence continues so long as the property 
is kept. It does not imply that a fresh offence is repeated daily while 
the property is retained. Similarly, the offence of wrongful restraint or 
wrongful confinement is a continuing offence; but it does not mean 
that a distinct offence is being repeated every day, hour or minute. 
The emphasis is upon the same offence, and the continuance is that of 
the same offence – and not on its repetition. The offence is completed 
when a person is convicted of keeping stolen property, knowing it was 
stolen. It is not true to state that if a man keeps stolen stuff for thirty 
days, he has committed thirty new offences, one for each day he keeps 
such property. The concept of continuation is, by definition, implied 
in the very connotation of the offence of retention, but it is the 
continuation of the same offence for which he can be convicted only 
once and tried in any of the local areas where the offence was 
continued. 
13. 
 
According to some authorities, there are two types of 
continuing offences: (a) crimes in which some acts material and 
essential to the crime occur in one area or province and some in 
another, (b) crimes in which all of the elements required for its 
completion may have occurred in a single place, but the violation of 

Crl. Misc. No.5151/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
 
the law is deemed to be continuing due to the very nature of the 
offence committed.  Examples of the first class are malversation and 
abduction, and libel is an example of the second category when a 
libellous matter is published or circulated from one place to another. 
The crime of jailbreak may also be included in the second class. The 
act of the escaped prisoner is a continuous or series of acts initiated by 
a single impulse and operated by an uninterruptible force, regardless 
of how long it lasts. It may not be correct to say that once a convict 
has escaped from the place of his confinement, the crime is 
consummated because as long as he continues to evade the service of 
his sentence, he is deemed to continue committing the crime, and may 
be arrested without a warrant, at any location where he may be found. 
14. 
 
To illustrate the practical application of the concept of a 
continuing offence, I may now refer to some judicial decisions. In 
Best v. Butlar [1932 (2) KB 108], the English Trade Union Act of 
1871 penalized an officer or a trade union member who willfully 
withheld any money, books, etc., of the trade union. The Court ruled 
that withholding the money was a continuing offence because the 
infraction occurred every day that the moneys were deliberately 
withheld. In Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner,  
[1969] 1 QB 439,  Fagan accidentally drove his car onto a police 
officer’s foot. The cop asked him to move but he delayed doing so. He 
was convicted of assaulting an officer while on duty. It was apparent 
that when Fagan drove upon the officer’s foot, he lacked the essential 
mens rea for the charge. However, the court decided that the assault 
involved a battery which continued after the car came to rest. Thus, 
there was a continuing act of assault (actus reus), and Fagan had the 
necessary mens rea at some point over its course. The offence 
continued until the car was removed. The court further stated that 
once an act is complete, even though the consequences continue to 
flow from it, the subsequent emergence of mens rea cannot turn it into 
an offence. In State of Bombay v. A.H. Bhiwandiwala  
(AIR 1955 Bombay 161), the High Court held that using the premises 
as a factory without a licence was a continuing offence. In State of 
Bihar v. J.P. Singh (1963 BLJR 782), the High Court of Patna held 
that operating a restaurant without registering it and failing to keep the 

Crl. Misc. No.5151/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
 
requisite records were continuing offences. In Mukesh and another v. 
State for NCT of Delhi and others (AIR 2017 SC 2161), the Supreme 
Court observed that conspiracy is a continuing offence that goes on 
until it is executed, retracted, or frustrated by necessity. The courts in 
India have applied the concept of continuing offence in many 
domestic violence cases because they generally occur over a long 
period. In Omprakash Devanand Shukla v. Sau. Aruna Omprakash 
Shukla (2021 Latest Caselaw 10751 Bombay), the husband’s counsel 
claimed that the complaint was barred by limitation under the 
Domestic Violence Act, specifically sections 28 and 31, read with 
section 468 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. The High 
Court rejected the argument, holding that a continuing offence is 
susceptible to continuance and is distinguishable from one committed 
once and for all. The retention of Stridhan by the husband and his 
family members was a continuing offence so long as it fell under the 
definition of “economic abuse” as given in section 3 of the Domestic 
Violence Act. In Shahida Faisal v. Federation of Pakistan and 
others (PLD 2000 Lahore 508), this Court ruled that non-payment of 
the loan was a continuing offence. 
15. 
 
In the present case, the gravamen of the complaint 
against the Petitioners is the Islamic-style minaret of their worship 
place. True, the minaret is a religious symbol for Muslims, but it is 
also an architectural feature. The earliest mosques lacked minarets. At 
the time of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), the call to prayer 
(Azan) was made from the highest roof near the mosque. Varying 
theories exist about the origin of minarets. Some scholars think that 
early Muslims adopted Greek watch towers to call people to prayer, 
which Muslims used for their own purposes before deciding to create 
their own architectural structure. Others believe that the Ziggurat 
towers of the Babylonian empire inspired the minaret. 
16. 
 
I do not need to determine in these proceedings whether 
sections 298-B and 298-C PPC prohibit and criminalize the 
construction of a worship place by Qadianis resembling a mosque. 
However, in my opinion, they do not mandate that the structures built 

Crl. Misc. No.5151/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 
 
before the promulgation of Ordinance XX of 1984, by which these 
provisions were introduced, should be razed or altered.  
17. 
 
As adumbrated, Qadianis built the worship place in 
question way back in 1922 and have inscribed Bait-ul-Zikar at its 
doorway. The Petitioners are just its caretakers. I wonder if they can 
be punished for an architecture crafted a hundred years ago. 
Admittedly, there is no allegation that they call the aforementioned 
worship place a mosque or have otherwise done anything that may 
hurt the feelings of Muslims within the contemplation of section  
298-C PPC. The Complainant has not explained why he kept mum for 
about 38 years after the promulgation of Ordinance XX of 1984 and 
what prompted him to lodge FIR No.699/2022. The Petitioners allege 
that he is attempting to score political points.  
18. 
 
I cannot understand how the doctrine of continuing 
offence is attracted to the facts and circumstances of the instant case. 
It is a settled principle that the prosecution must prove that the 
accused possessed mens rea when he committed the act which caused 
the actus reus. However, as the case of Fagan explained, where an 
actus reus may be brought about by a continuing action, it is sufficient 
that the accused had mens rea during its continuance, albeit he did not 
have mens rea at its inception. When Qadianis built their worship 
place, its architectural design did not violate any law then in force. 
They have not committed any continuing act to bring about actus reus 
now. Even if sections 298-B and 298-C PPC are assumed as strict 
liability offences, the prosecution must show that the Petitioners did 
something to constitute actus reus. It has not done so. 
19. 
 
In Tahir Naqash and others v. The State others  
(PLD 2022 SC 385), the Supreme Court of Pakistan stated: 
 
“Article 260(3) of the Constitution, though declares the 
Ahmadis/Qadianis as non-Muslim, it neither disowns them as 
citizens of Pakistan nor deprives them of their entitlement to the 
fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The 
Constitution treats, safeguards and protects all its citizens equally, 
whether they are Muslims or non-Muslims. Article 4 of the 
Constitution is an inalienable right of every citizen, including 
minority citizens of Pakistan, which guarantees the right to enjoy 
the protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law.”

I have accepted this application and admitted the 
Petitioners to pre-arrest bail by short order of even date. These are the 
reasons for it.
