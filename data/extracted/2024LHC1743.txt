       16.04.2024. Mr. Kashif Arshad Malik, Advocate for the petitioner.  
 
Through instant criminal revision under section 439 of 
Cr.P.C. read with section 435 Cr.P.C., Ali Zain, the petitioner, 
has prayed for setting aside the order dated 11.03.2024 
(wrongly mentioned as 06.03.2024 in prayer) passed by the 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore, whereby the 
petitioner was not allowed to put question to Syed Muhammad 
Younus Bukhari draftsman (PW-1) regarding the relevancy of 
site plan of place of recovery of weapon of offence.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that during 
cross-examination, Muhammad Younus Bukhari, draftsman 
(PW-1), was questioned about the site plan prepared by him, 
and the trial court has not allowed putting the question to the 
said witness as a not relevant question. The petitioner be 
allowed to put the question on the witness about the site plan 
he prepared and order dated 11.03.2024 to the extent of 
disallowing the petitioner to be set aside.  
3. 
Heard. Record perused.  
4. 
On perusal of the examination in chief as well as cross-
examination conducted by the defence on Muhammad Younus 
Bukhari draftsman (PW-1), it reveals that during cross-
examination, the defence put the question about the site plan 
of the place of recovery of the weapon of offence prepared by 
the investigating officer to the above said, witness. It is 
admitted that Muhammad Younus Bukhari, draftsman (PW-1),

is not the author of the site plan nor the witness on whose 
pointing site plan was prepared. Learned counsel for the 
petitioner admitted that the petitioner just wanted to verify the 
place of occurrence from the prosecution witness. For this 
reason, he referred to the site plan of the place of recovery of 
the weapon of offence. Learned counsel for the petitioner 
admitted that the petitioner had not prepared the site plan of 
the place of recovery of the weapon of the offence, nor did he 
remain a witness or, under his instructions, have the site plan 
prepared. Muhammad Younus Bukhari, draftsman (PW-1), is 
not a scriber of the site plan or cannot be considered an 
attesting witness. Thus, the totality of what has been detailed 
and discussed in the order impugned before this Court is 
sound and reasonable. Learned counsel for the petitioner has 
failed to point out any illegality or legal infirmity in the 
impugned order dated 11.03.2024 passed by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore, warranting interference by 
this Court. 
5.  
The upshot of the above discussion is that the instant 
petition is without any substance, which is hereby dismissed.
