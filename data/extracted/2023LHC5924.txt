Muhammad Khawar Ilyas  
Versus 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Finance & Economic Affairs 
Division, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad & others 
 
J U D G M E N T 
Date of hearing:    15.11.2023. 
Petitioner by: 
M/s. Dr. Malik Muhammad Hafeez, Muhammad 
Shahid Shaheen, Kashif Mehmood Babar and 
Malik Khaleel Ahmad Mamra, Advocates. 
Respondents by: 
Mr. Mahmood Ahmad Bhatti, Advocate. 
 
Miss Riffat Yasmeen, Assistant Attorney 
General for Pakistan. 
 
Mr. Zafar Iqbal Awan, Additional Advocate 
General on Court’s call. 
 
Rai Mazhar Hussain Kharal, Assistant Advocate 
General on Court’s call. 
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant petition, petitioner has challenged the correspondence dated  
23.06.2021 & 03.12.2021, issued by respondent No.3 / Chief 
Commissioner Inland Revenue, Regional Tax Office, Bahawalpur, 
whereby pursuant to an Enquiry Report dated 19.06.2021 – 
recommending imposition of major penalty of dismissal from 
service – show cause notice, followed by personal hearing notice, 
was issued to petitioner in connection with disciplinary proceedings 
under the Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 
(“the Ordinance of 2000”). 
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that disciplinary 
proceedings under the Ordinance of 2000 could not have been 
initiated as the same stood repealed by the Removal from Service 
(Special Powers) (Repeal) Act, 2010 (“the Act of 2010”), 

2 
W.P No.10464 of 2021 
published in official Gazette on 06.03.2010, which specifically 
envisaged that the disciplinary proceedings would be conducted 
under the Act ibid, relating to persons in government service, to 
whom the Civil Servants Act, 1973 and the Government Servants 
(Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 1973 are applicable. Adds that 
petitioner stood retired from service after attaining the age of 
superannuation on 08.07.2021, therefore, pending inquiry / 
disciplinary proceedings stand abated in view of Rule 54-A of the 
Fundamental Rules.1 Contends that petitioner has been acquitted by 
the Accountability Court on the same set of allegations, which are 
now part of the disciplinary proceedings, thus he cannot be vexed 
twice on the same charges. Argues that even otherwise, the 
National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 has overriding effect over 
all other laws for the time being in force (section 3). He has relied 
upon Deputy Director Food and 2 others v. Akhtar Ali, Foodgrains 
Inspector (1997 SCMR 343), Muhammad Anwar Bajwa, Executive 
Director, Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan, 1-Faisal 
Avenue, Zero Point, Islamabad v. Chairman, Agricultural 
Development Bank of Pakistan, Faisal Avenue, Zero Point, 
Islamabad [2001 PLC (C.S.) 336], Syed Abdus Salam Kazmi v. 
Managing Director, WASA, Multan and another [2005 PLC (C.S.) 
244].  
3. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer, assisted by learned counsel 
for respondents, submits that petitioner has raised factual 
controversy which cannot be resolved by this Court in exercise of 
constitutional jurisdiction. Further submits that charge sheet, order 
of enquiry, show cause notice and personal hearing notice were 
issued to petitioner under the applicable law inasmuch as writ does 
not lie against the show cause notice. Contends that no order 
regarding petitioner’s dismissal, removal or suspension from 
services has been passed, therefore, instant petition being premature

Updated Edition-2018, inserted by S.R.O.1143(I)/80 dated 10.11.1980, Gazette of Pakistan., Extra., Part II, Page 2215, 
dated 20-11-1980.

W.P No.10464 of 2021 
is unsustainable, besides being not maintainable in view of the bar 
contained in Article 212 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973. Adds that the departmental proceedings were 
paused due to non-availability of record of refund cases being in 
custody of the NAB authorities and the Accountability Court, and 
upon receipt of the record, proceedings have been initiated, hence 
no illegality has been committed. Lastly submits that the 
department has ample legal authority to proceed against petitioner 
as per applicable rules, regulations and law. Reliance has been 
placed upon Naseer Pervaz Qureshi v. Board of Directors, ZTBL, 
through Company Secretary and 3 others [2015 PLC (C.S.) 1293] 
and  Muhammad Azim Khan Leghari v. Federation of Pakistan and 
others [2017 PLC (C.S.) 336]. 
4. 
Submissions of learned counsel for the parties have been 
heard at length and available record has been perused with their 
able assistance. 
5. 
Record reflects that disciplinary proceedings commenced 
against petitioner in the year 2007 under the Ordinance of 2000 
vide Order of Enquiry dated 07.11.2007, on the following charges:- 
a) 
Mr. Khawar Ilyas, Special Officer of Income Tax E&IP Unit-04, 
Bahawalpur issued refunds of Rs.12.87 million in 80 cases of 
Army Contractors (washermen / hair-dressers) from Unit-04, 
Bahawalpur whereas the jurisdiction of E&IP Unit-04 relates to 
Cotton Ginners / Oil Mills. It is established that you have 
proceeded unlawfully with mala fide intention exercising the 
powers beyond your jurisdiction. List of cases enclosed as 
ANNEX-A. 
b) 
Mr. Khawar Ilyas, Special Officer of Income Tax E&IP Unit-04, 
Bahawalpur issued refunds in all the above cases without proper 
verification from relevant DPC/DPU/Controller of Military 
Accounts / District Accounts, Bahawalpur as the payments were 
deposited on TR Challans at National Bank of Pakistan Limited, 
Bahawalpur and verification of tax deposited into treasury could 
easily be made therefrom. Thus, you flouted the instructions 
contained in CBR’s Circular No.05 of 2003 Dated 30.06.2003. 
c) 
Mr. Khawar Ilyas, Special Officer of Income Tax E&IP Unit-04, 
Bahawalpur was required to provide refund voucher / advice 
books and certain assessment record of Unit-04, Bahawalpur to 
Mr. Muhammad Akhtar Suraj, ACIT duly authorized to examine 
and collect it by this office. You telephonically informed that 
refund voucher / advice books are not available with you and are 

4 
W.P No.10464 of 2021 
lying with some official of your unit at his residence. However, 
subsequently you changed your stance and stated in writing that 
these refund / advice books are in the custody of higher 
authorities vide letter No.106 dated 23.10.2007. The CIT, 
Bahawalpur (look after charge) has denied it vide his letter 
No.Ad.PF/07-08/CIT-BWP/1379 
dated 
23.10.2007. 
Non 
production and mis-statement on your part is insubordination and 
tantamount to “Misconduct”. 
 
 
Petitioner furnished reply on 04.02.2008, Inquiry Officer furnished 
recommendation on 18.04.2008, however the competent authority 
ordered issuance of fresh charge sheet. Second inquiry, consisting 
upon two members, triggered vide order dated 01.07.2008 and after 
accomplishing different stages, final show cause notice was issued 
on 29.06.2011. However, vide order dated 29.03.2012, fresh inquiry 
– constituting Inquiry Committee consisting upon three officers – 
was ordered. But the same encountered a halt as the record was 
with the NAB authorities and the Accountability Court, however 
after petitioner’s acquittal vide order dated 05.04.2019 and receipt 
of record, the inquiry again commenced and finalized vide Inquiry 
Report dated 19.06.2021, whereby penalty of dismissal from service 
was proposed against petitioner. Whereupon, impugned show cause 
notice and personal hearing notice were issued, which are under-
challenge before this Court. 
6. 
It is evidently clear from above history that disciplinary 
proceedings commenced in the year 2007 when the Ordinance of 
2000 was in field and subsequent proceedings / stages of inquiry are 
in continuation of initial inquiry proceedings. Undeniably, the 
Ordinance of 2000 was repealed by the Act of 2010, however under 
sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Act ibid, all proceedings pending 
under the repealed Ordinance against any person whether in 
government service or corporation service were held to be 
continued. In these circumstances, the repeal of Ordinance of 2000 
cannot be made a shield to save petitioner from the disciplinary 
proceedings commenced much before the repeal. And, under sub-

5 
W.P No.10464 of 2021 
section (3) of Section 2 of the Act ibid, all fresh disciplinary 
proceedings from 5th March, 2010 onwards relating to persons in 
government service, to whom the Civil Servants Act, 1973 (LXXI 
of 1973) and the Government Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) 
Rules, 1973, apply were held to be governed under the Act ibid and 
the rules made thereunder. In the given circumstances, there is no 
harm to the disciplinary proceedings initiated under the Ordinance 
of 2000 well before its repeal and petitioner cannot claim to wriggle 
out the same on this misconceived plea.  
7. 
It is ridiculous that the conclusion of the impugned inquiry is 
not in sight despite lapse of almost 14-years (till personal hearing 
notice) and in the meanwhile,  petitioner was retired from service 
on 08.07.2021. It is irony that the respondents have no plausible 
explanation and legal excuse for this lapse. The so-called 
interruption on the basis of proceedings before the NAB authorities/ 
the Accountability Court, is misconceived as the underlying 
principle of initiating disciplinary proceedings is to ascertain 
whether the charges of misconduct against the delinquent are 
proved or not, and in case his guilt is proved, what action,  which 
may include imposition of minor or major penalties, should be 
triggered against him under the applicable Service Laws, Rules 
and Regulations. The purpose of departmental inquiry is to 
maintain and uphold discipline and decorum in the institution and 
efficiency of the department to strengthen and preserve public 
confidence. Whereas proceeding under the penal statutes are 
altogether different where the prosecution has to prove the guilt 
of accused beyond any reasonable doubt, and if proved, 
punishment is awarded for the offences committed by the 
accused. It is well-settled exposition of law that the prosecution 
in the criminal cases as well as the departmental inquiry on the 
same allegations can be conducted and continued concurrently at 
both venues without having any overriding or overlapping effect. 
Reference can be made to Syed Ali Shah Bukhari v. Chief 

6 
W.P No.10464 of 2021 
Secretary, Government of Punjab, Lahore and another (PLD 2004 
Supreme Court 51), Syed Muhammad Iqbal Jafri v. Registrar, 
Lahore High Court, Lahore  (2004 SCMR 540), Province of 
Punjab through Special Secretary, Specialized Healthcare and 
Medical Education Department, Lahore and others v. Khadim 
Hussain Abbasi (2021 SCMR 1419),  Faraz Naveed v. District 
Police Officer Gujrat and another (2022 SCMR 1770) and 
Postmaster General, Karachi and another v. Arshad Ali (2022 
SCMR 1796). 
8. 
Admittedly, the disciplinary proceedings initiated against 
the petitioner were not concluded during his tenure of service and 
as such the charges alleged against him could not be established. 
In view of Rule 54-A of the Fundamental Rules, if the 
disciplinary proceedings, including an inquiry, against an 
employee or public servant started during his / her service and are  
not concluded until the age of superannuation,  such proceedings 
shall stand abated upon retirement and such government servant 
is entitled to get full pensionary benefits. Rule 54-A ibid, is 
reproduced hereunder for ease of reference:- 
"[F.R. 54-A. If a Government servant, who has been suspended 
pending inquiry into his conduct attains the age of 
superannuation before the completion of inquiry, the disciplinary 
proceedings against him shall abate and such government 
servant shall retire with full pensionary benefits and the period of 
suspension shall be treated as period spend on duty.]" 
 
The effect of afore-referred provision is mandatory because of 
the word "shall" used therein, as a result, the disciplinary 
proceedings initiated against petitioner stood abated upon his 
retirement on 08.07.2021, and he is entitled to full post-
retirement benefits permissible under the law. Reliance is placed 
upon Muhammad Zaheer Khan v. Government of Pakistan through 
Secretary, Establishment and others [2010 PLC (C.S.) 559], 
Parveen Javaid v. Chairman WAPDA and 5 others [2011 PLC 
(C.S.) 1527]. Irshad Ahmed v. Port Qasim Authority through 

7 
W.P No.10464 of 2021 
Chairman and 2 others [2019 PLC (C.S.) 557] and Nasir Kamal v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Maritime 
Affairs, Islamabad and another [2021 P L C (C.S.) 1226]. 
9.  
Generally, a statute which regulates the manner in which 
public officials exercise the powers vested in them is construed to 
be directory rather than mandatory, especially when neither 
private or public rights are injured or impaired thereby. But if the 
public interest or private rights call for the exercise of the power 
vested in a public official, the language used, though permissive 
and directory in form, is in fact peremptory or mandatory as a 
general rule. This general principle, however, does not apply 
where the phraseology of the provision, or the nature of the act to 
be performed, or the consequence of performing or failing to 
perform it within the prescribed timeframe is such that the 
prescription of timeframe is actually a limitation on the power of 
the public functionary. Or where a public functionary is 
empowered to create liability against a citizen only within the 
prescribed time, the performance of such a duty within the 
specified timeframe is mandatory. Where a public official can 
impose liability on a retired employee if the power is exercised 
within a certain statutory timeframe and there is a delay in the 
exercise of such power on the part of a public official, no such 
liability can be imposed after the lapse of the statutory period. 
Reference can be made to Province of Punjab through 
Conservator of Forest, Faisalabad and others v. Javed Iqbal 
(2021 SCMR 328). 
10. 
So far as objection qua maintainability of this petition, as 
urged by learned Law Officer as well as learned counsel for 
respondent that petitioner is obliged to resort to Federal Service 
Tribunal, is concerned, suffice it to say that in the cases of Parveen 
Javaid, Irshad Ahmed and Nasir Kamal, supra, matter involving 
applicability of Rule 54-A of the Fundamental Rules have been 

8 
W.P No.10464 of 2021 
decided while exercising extraordinary jurisdiction by the High 
Courts, hence this objection is overruled.  
11. 
So far as objection that Writ Petition against issuance of 
Show Cause Notice is not maintainable, is concerned, admittedly in 
routine writ is not maintainable; however, where the show cause 
notice was barred by law or abuse of process of the Court or was 
coram non judice, and if the issuance of the show cause notice 
was without jurisdiction or with mala fide, the same can be 
challenged in Writ Petition as held in the cases reported as 
Commissioner Inland Revenue and others v. Jahangir Khan Tareen 
and others (2022 SCMR 92), Jahangir Muggo and others v. 
Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and others (2022 
CLD 1325), Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Ministry of Information and others 
(2021 CLC 159), Dr. Fatima Arshad v. Government of the Punjab 
and others (2020 PLC (C.S.) 688), Reliance Commodities (Private) 
Ltd. v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2020 Lahore 632), 
Dr. Seema Irfan and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others 
(PLD 2019 Sindh 516) and Riffat Hassan and 9 others v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Chairman, Federal Board of 
Revenue/Secretary, Revenue Division and another [2011 PLC (C.S.) 
562]. 
12. 
The case law, relied upon by learned counsel for respondents, 
is on distinguishable facts and inapplicable to the facts and 
circumstances of this case.  
13. 
I would like to observe that the scheme of the Punjab 
Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006,2 
the Punjab Civil Services Pension Rules, 1955,3 Rule 54-A of the 
Fundamental 
Rules 
and 
instructions 
contained in Civil 
Establishment Code (ESTACODE) regarding quick disposal of 
disciplinary proceedings pending against government servants who 
                                                 
2 Section 1(4)(iii)  and Proviso to Section 21.  
3 Proviso to Rule 1.8 (b). 

9 
W.P No.10464 of 2021 
are about to superannuate4 seems to supports the public policy 
that an employee who has served the Government all his life 
must enjoy his retirement in peace and must be spared from 
undergoing long drawn departmental proceedings during his 
retired life. Therefore, it is directed that disciplinary proceedings 
pending against government servants who are about to 
superannuate are fast tracked so that they are concluded well 
before the retirement date (in case of employees of Federal 
government) and within the prescribed timeframe (in case of 
employees of Punjab government) to achieve the intent of the 
legislature and save the rights and interests of the departments 
and the government servants. All the departments are required to 
abide by the applicable instructions / law for disposal of the 
disciplinary proceedings of retiring and retired employees. The 
Federal as well as Punjab Governments are directed to issue clear 
instructions to all the departments for strict observance of aforesaid 
provisions without fail. Office to transmit copy of this judgment to 
concerned quarters for information and compliance accordingly. 
14. 
In view of the above, instant petition is allowed and 
impugned show cause notice dated 23.06.2021 and personal hearing 
notice dated 03.12.2021 are declared to be illegal and without 
lawful authority. The respondents are directed to release pensionary 
benefits of petitioner as per law within a period of thirty days from 
the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.
