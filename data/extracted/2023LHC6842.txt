and voter members of the constituencies filed their objections to the 
Election Commission but the objections were discarded by way of order 
dated 26th November, 2023, hence these petitions under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter referred 
to as “Constitution”). 
3.  
I have heard learned counsel for the petitioners as well as 
learned Law Officer and perused the record with their able assistance. 
4.  
The Election Commission is the creation of the “Constitution”. 
Part VIII of the “Constitution” deals with Chief Election Commissioner 
and Election Commission. Article 218 of the “Constitution” lays down the 
composition of the Election Commission and its duties prime of which is to 
hold election to both Houses of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), Provincial 
Assemblies and such other public offices as may be specified by law. In the 
case of WORKERS’ PARTY PAKISTAN through Athar Hussain, Advocate, 
General Secretary and 6 others v. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and 2 
others (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 681), the Supreme Court of Pakistan, 
outlined the significance and scope of Article 218 of the “Constitution” in 
the following words: - 
“38. 
The Constitution provides a comprehensive mechanism 
to ensure minimal deviation from these dictates. It identifies and 
regulates one of the key aspects of democracy, the election process. In 
Article 218, the Constitution constitutes the Election Commission and 
empowers it to organize and oversee the election process and to ensure, 
inter alia, that it is conducted "honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance 
with law and that corrupt practices are guarded against". Article 218(3) 
of the Constitution enumerates the broad and overarching responsibility 
of the Election Commission and declares that:-- 
 
 
"218. Election Commission. 
 
(1) For the purpose of election to both Houses of Majlis-e-
Shoora (Parliament), Provincial Assemblies and for election to 
such other public offices as may be specified by law, a 
permanent Election Commission shall be constituted in 
accordance with this Article. 
 
 
(2) The Election Commission shall consist of-- 
 
(a) The Commissioner who shall be the Chairman of the 
Commission; and 
 

3 
 
 
 
W.Ps.No.4099, 4100, 4101, 4135 and 4151 of 2023 
 
 
 
(b) four members, each of whom has been a Judge of a High 
Court from each Province, appointed by the President in the 
manner provided for appointment of the Commissioner in 
clauses (2A) and (2B) of Article 213. 
 
(3) It shall be the duty of the Election Commission constituted in 
relation to an election to organize and conduct the election and to 
make such arrangements as are necessary to ensure that the 
election is conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance 
with law, and that corrupt practices are guarded against." 
 
39. 
The phrase "the election is conducted honestly, justly, 
fairly and in accordance with law, and that corrupt practices are 
guarded against" as used in Article 218(3) of the Constitution informs 
the content and scope of powers conferred by it on the Election 
Commission. It may be advantageous to refer to the meanings of the 
terms "honestly", "justly" and "fairly" as given in various legal 
instruments, which read as under: - 
 
 
"Honestly": 
 
(i) 
'honest' means full of honour: just: fair dealing: upright: the 
opposite of thievish: free from fraud: candid: truthful: ingenious: 
seemly: respectable: chaste: honourable; 'honestly' means in an 
honest way: in truth; 'honesty' is the state of being honest: 
integrity: candour. [Chambers, 20th Century Dictionary, New 
Edition 1983 at page 601] 
 
(ii) 
'honesty'-"according  to  the  best  lexicographers  the  words 
'truth' 'veracity' and 'honesty' are almost synonymous, very nearly 
the same definitions being given to each of the words". [P. 
Ramanatha Aiyar's "Advanced Law Lexicon", 2005 Edition, Vol. 
2, at page 2153] 
 
(iii) 
Honesty is a thing deemed to be done in good faith, where it is 
infact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not. 
[Fakhruddin v. A. Shah (PLD 1982 Kar 790)] 
 
(vi) 
Honestly is state of mind which is psychological factor capable 
to prove or disprove only by a evidence or conduct. [Amjad 
Khan v. Marium (1993 CLC 175)] 
 
 
"Justly" 
 
(i) 
'just' means "conforming to or consonant with, what is legal or 
lawful, legally right, lawful"; ... "The words 'just' and 'justly' do 
not always mean 'just' and 'justly' in a moral sense, but they not 
unfrequently, in their connection with other words in a sentence, 
where a very different signification. It is evident, however, that 
the word 'just' in the statute [requiring an affidavit for an 
attachment to State that plaintiff's claim is just] means 'just ' in a 
moral sense; and from its isolation, being made a separate sub-
division of the section, it is intended to mean 'morally just' in the 
most emphatic terms. The claim must be morally just as well as 
the legally just in order to entitle a party to an attachment."

Robinson v. Burton (5 Kan. 300.) [Black's Law Dictionary, 
Revised 4th Edition of 1968, at page 1001] 
 
(ii) 
"just' means righteous: fair: impartial: according to justice: due: 
in accordance with facts: well-grounded: accurately true: exact: 
normal: close-fitting: precisely: exactly: so much and no more: 
barely: only: merely: quite; "justly' means in a just manner: 
equitably: accurately: by right; "justness' means equity: 
fittingness: exactness. [Chambers, 20th Century Dictionary, New 
Edition 1983 at page 686] 
 
(iii)  
'just'. As an adjective, fair; adequate; reasonable; probable; right 
in accordance with law and justice right in law or ethics; rightful; 
legitimate, well founded; conformable to laws; conforming to the 
requirements of right or positive law; conformed to rules or 
principle of justice. 2 Bom LR 845. As an adverb of time the 
word "just' is equivalent to ""at this moment," of the least 
possible time since" (Ame. Cyc.). 
 
The word "just' is derived from the Latin "justus' which is from 
the Latin "jus' which means a right, and more technically a legal 
right--- a law. The world "just' is defined by the Century 
Dictionary as conforming to the requirements of right or of 
positive law, and in Anderson's Law Dictionary as probable, 
reasonable. Kinney's Law Dictionary defines "just' as fair, 
adequate, reasonable, probable, and justa causa as a just case, a 
lawful ground. Being in conformity with justice [S.191, Expln.2, 
ill. (a) IPC (45 of 1860) and Art. 42, Const]; fair. 
 
An allegation is an indictment that an offence has "just' come to 
the knowledge of an officer having authority to prosecute is, by 
implication, a sufficient allegation that the offence had not 
previously come to the knowledge of any other public officer 
having authority to prosecute. 
 
"JUST' as sued in Laws providing that an affidavit for 
attachment shall show the nature of the plaintiffs claim, and that 
it is just, etc., should be construed to mean just in a moral sense. 
The claim must be morally just, as well as legally just in order to 
entitle a party to an attachment. "Shall have the power, if he shall 
think just, to order a new trial." in the County Courts Act, 1888 
(51 & 52 Vict. c. 43), S.93. These words do not give a County 
court judge an absolute power of granting new trials. His power 
under the section is subject to the rules and limitations as to the 
granting of new trials which are binding upon the High Court, 
the Court of Appeal, and the House of Lords. Murtagh v. Barry 
(1890) 44 Ch D 632 (LORD COLERIDGE, C.J.). The crucial 
word in the phrase is ""just" which imparts a judicial, and not an 
absolute power. (Craies St. Law). 
 
The term "just' is derived from the Latin word "justus'. The word, 
"just' connotes reasonableness and something conforming to 
rectitude and justice something requirable and fair. M.A. Rahim 
and another v. Sayari Bai, AIR 1973 Mad 83,87. The world 'just' 
denotes equitability, fairness and reasonableness having a large

peripheral field. Helen  C. Rebellor v. Maharashtra S.R.T.C., 
(1999) 1 SCC 90, para 28: AIR 1998 SC 3191. The world 'just' 
occurring in Section 168 of the Act means that the compensation 
must be just and it cannot be a bonanza; not a source of profit but 
same should not be a pittance. The expression 'just' denotes 
equitability, fairness and reasonableness and non-arbitrariness. 
Divisional Controller KSRTC v. Mahadeva  Shetty, (2003) 7 
SCC 197, para 15. [Motor Vehicles Act (59 of 1988), S. 168]. 
 
Reasonableness may be 'good cause' but it is not necessarily 'just 
cause'. If a person voluntarily retires on pension, he is getting a 
substantial financial benefit for himself, and it is not fair or just 
to the unemployment fund that he should also get unemployment 
benefit for the six weeks under the act. Crewe v. Social Security 
Commissioner, (1982) 2 All ER 745, 749. [Social Security Act, 
1975, S.20(1)(a)]. 
 
The words 'just cause' in S.263 are exhaustive and not merely 
illustrative. Merely the failure to fill an inventory or the account 
within the specified time is not sufficient. It must be established 
that the person to whom the grant has been made wilfully and 
without reasonable cause omitted to exhibit them. In Re. T. 
Arumuga Mudaliar, AIR 1955 Mad 622. [Indian Succession Act 
(39 of 1925), S.263]. [P. Ramanatha Aiyar's "Advanced Law 
Lexicon", 2005 Edition, Vol. 3, at pages 2539 and 2540:] 
 
(iv) 
'just' means according to law. [Utility Stores Corporation  of 
Pakistan Ltd v. Punjab Labour Appellate Tribunal (PLD 1987 SC 
447) and Shahi Bottlers (Pvt) Ltd v. Punjab Appellate Tribunal 
(1993 SCMR 1370)] 
 
 
"Fairly" 
 
(i) 
'fairly' means "equitably, honestly, impartially.... Justly, rightly, 
with substantial correctness, reasonably...". [Black's Law 
Dictionary, Revised 4th Edition of 1968, at page 719] 
 
(ii) 
'fairly' means beautifully: neatly: justly: reasonably: plainly: 
gently: fully: quite: tolerably. [Chambers, 20th Century 
Dictionary, New Edition 1983 at page 452] 
 
(iii) 
'fair' --"the world conveys some idea of justice or equity in 
partial free from suspicion or bias; equitable; reasonable; honest; 
upright; and as applied to the weather, a fair weather is one free 
from clouds; not obscure"-'FAIR, HONEST, EQUITABLE, 
REASONABLE' 
- 
'fairness" 
enters 
into 
every 
minute 
circumstance connected with the interest of the parties, and 
weights them alike for both; honestly is contended with a literal 
conformity to the law, it consults the interest of one party. An 
estimate is fair in which profit and loss, merit and demerit with 
every collateral circumstance is duly weighed; a judgment is 
equitable which decides suitably and advantageously for both 
parties; a price is reasonable which does not exceed the limits of 
reason or propriety. A decision may be either fair or equitable; 
but the former is said mostly in regard to trifling matters, and the 

6 
 
 
 
W.Ps.No.4099, 4100, 4101, 4135 and 4151 of 2023 
 
 
 
latter in regard to the important rights of mankind. It is the 
business of the umpire to decide fairly between  the  combatants, 
it  is  the  business  of  the  Judge  to decide  equitably  between  
men  whose  property  is  at  issue." [P. Ramanatha Aiyar's 
"Advanced Law Lexicon", 2005 Edition, Vol. 2, at page 1761 
and 1762] 
 
A perusal of the above shows that the words "justly", "fairly" and 
"honestly" have similar shades of meaning. As has been rightly 
submitted by Mr. Farogh Naseem, these words imply that the Election 
Commission is under a direct constitutional obligation to exercise all 
powers invested in it in a bona fide manner, meeting the highest of 
standards and norms. As a natural corollary, therefore, all discretionary 
power is also to be exercised and tested against these standards. 
 
40. 
A bare reading of Article 218(3) makes it clear that the 
Election Commission is charged with the duty to 'organize' and 'conduct 
the election'. The language of the Article implies that the Election 
Commission is responsible not only for conducting the election itself, 
but also for making all necessary arrangements for the said purpose, 
prior to the Election Day. By conferring such responsibility on the 
Election Commission, the Constitution ensures that all activities both 
prior, on and subsequent to Election Day, that are carried out in 
anticipation thereof, adhere to standards of justness and fairness, are 
honest, in accordance with law and free from corrupt practices. This 
Court in Election Commission of Pakistan v. Javaid Hashmi and others 
(PLD 1989 SC 396), observed that "(g)enerally speaking election is a 
process which starts with the issuance of the election programme and 
consists of the various links and stages in that behalf, as for example, 
filing of nomination papers, their scrutiny, the hearing of objections and 
the holding of actual polls. If any of these links is challenged it really 
(is) tantamount to challenging the said process of election". It 
interpreted that the phrase 'conduct the election' as having "wide import" 
and including all stages involved in the election process. These 
observations subject all election related activities that take place 
between the commencement and the end of the election process to the 
jurisdiction conferred on the Election Commission under Article 218(3). 
The Election Commission therefore has to test all election related 
activities that are carried out in the relevant period, both individually and 
collectively, against the standards enumerated therein. 
 
41. 
The Election Commission may also exercise its powers in 
anticipation of an ill that may have the effect of rendering the election 
unfair. In the case titled as In Re: Petition filed by Syed Qaim Ali Shah 
Jellani (PLD 1991 Jour. 41) the Elections Commission exercised its 
powers under Article 218(3) pre-emptively, by making all necessary 
arrangements to ensure that a certain class of people would be allowed 
to vote. This case implies that where a violation of the standards 
mentioned in Article 218(3) has not as yet taken place, the Election 
Commission is legally empowered under Article 218(3) to exercise its 
powers pre-emptively in order to avoid a violation of these standards. 
Furthermore, Mst. Qamar Sultana v. Public at Large (1989 MLD 360) 
and In Re: Complaint of Malpractices in Constituency No. NA-57, 
Sargodha-V (supra) both reinforce the argument that the Election 
Commission is fully empowered by Article 218(3) to make 'such orders 

7 
 
 
 
W.Ps.No.4099, 4100, 4101, 4135 and 4151 of 2023 
 
 
 
as may in its opinion be necessary for ensuring that the election is fair, 
honest etc'. These decisions recognize that the Election Commission 
enjoys broad powers not only to take pre-emptive action but also to pass 
any and all orders necessary to ensure that the standards of 'honesty, 
justness and fairness' mentioned in Article 218(3) are met.” 
5.  
In order to amend, consolidate and unify laws relating to the 
conduct of elections and matters connected therewith or ancillary thereto, 
the Elections Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as “Act”) was 
promulgated. The matter in issue since relates to the delimitation of the 
constituencies, so instead of pondering upon any other aspect, it would be 
apposite to have a direct recourse to Chapter-III of the “Act”, which deals 
with the subject. Section 17 mandates the Election Commission to delimit 
territorial constituencies for elections to the National Assembly, each 
Provincial Assembly and to the local governments in accordance with the 
provisions of the “Constitution”, the “Act”, the Rules and the applicable 
local government law. Section 19 specifies the manner of delimitation of 
constituencies  whereas section 20 lays down the principles of delimitation, 
which is relevant for the matter in issue. Section 20 is, thus, reproduced 
below: - 
“20. 
Principles of delimitation. (1) All constituencies for 
general seats shall, as far as practicable, be delimited having 
regard to the distribution of population in geographically 
compact areas, physical features, existing boundaries of 
administrative units, facilities of communication and public 
convenience and other cognate factors to ensure homogeneity in 
the creation of constituencies. 
(2)  
Omitted vide elections (Second Amendment) Act, 2023 
dated 5th August, 2023. 
 
(2-A) For the purpose of delimiting constituencies, for the 
general seats of the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
for Tribal Areas two or more separate areas may be grouped 
into one constituency for their elections to be held in 2019 and 
Bye-elections related thereto and thereafter this sub-section shall 
stand omitted. (added by the Elections (Second Amendment) Act, 
2019 dated 16th May, 2019.  
(3)  
As far as possible, variation in population of 
constituencies of an Assembly or a local government shall not 
ordinarily exceed ten percent. 
(4) 
If the limit of ten percent under sub-section (3) is 
exceeded in an exceptional case, the Commission shall record 
reasons thereof in the delimitation order.” 

8 
 
 
 
W.Ps.No.4099, 4100, 4101, 4135 and 4151 of 2023 
 
 
 
From the bare reading of the above noted provision of law, it clearly 
manifests that there are numerous factors which matters for the purpose of 
delimitation of constituencies as is incorporated in sub-section (1) above. 
6.  
In order to carry out the purpose of the “Act”, the Election 
Rules, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as “Rules”) were framed. Chapter-III 
of the “Rules” deals with delimitation of the constituencies of Assemblies. 
Rule 10 prescribes a detailed mechanism for preparation of draft 
proposals for delimitation of constituencies, which reads as under: - 
10.  
Draft proposals for delimitation of constituencies.— (1) 
A Delimitation Committee constituted under rule 9 shall, 
immediately after its constitution, proceed to obtain from 
Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, population data of last census 
officially published along with relevant maps showing therein 
census charges, census circles and census blocks along with 
description, relating to a Province, a district or any other 
administrative or revenue unit as it may require.  
  
(2) The Delimitation Committee shall also obtain district 
maps along with description, duly authenticated by Pakistan 
Bureau of Statistics, or, as the case may be, the district head of 
Revenue Department, prepared on a uniform scale as may be 
determined by the Commission indicating therein details of all 
administrative and revenue units in the district to the level of a 
Patwar Circle or, as the case may be, a Tapedar Circle, as well 
as prominent geographical and physical features, such as rivers 
and mountains and any other information as may be determined 
by the Commission or required by the Committee.  
  
(3) In preparing draft proposals for delimitation of 
constituencies, the Delimitation Committee shall follow the 
principles of delimitation as laid down in section 20, procedure 
given in this Chapter and the guidelines provided by the 
Commission from time to time.  
  
(4) The constituency for an Assembly shall not ordinarily 
extend to more than one district except in exceptional 
circumstances for reasons to be recorded by the Delimitation 
Committee:  
Provided that a Patwar Circle or, as the case may be, a 
Tapedar Circle shall be the basic unit for delimitation and it 
shall not be broken under any circumstances:  
Provided further that in case of urban areas census circle 
shall not be broken under any circumstances: 
(5) As far as possible, the delimitation of constituencies 
of an Assembly shall start from the Northern end of the district, 
and then proceed clock-wise in zigzag manner keeping in view 

9 
 
 
 
W.Ps.No.4099, 4100, 4101, 4135 and 4151 of 2023 
 
 
 
that population among the constituencies of an Assembly shall 
remain as close as may be practicable to the quota:  
Provided that the quota under this sub-rule shall be 
determined by dividing total population of the district with 
number of seats allocated to that district: 
Provided further that the variation in population between 
two or more constituencies shall not ordinarily exceed ten 
percent and the Delimitation Committee shall record reasons if, 
in exceptional circumstances, the variation has to exceed the 
limit.  
(6) For the purpose of preparation of draft proposals for 
delimitation, the Delimitation Committee may require assistance 
from any Federal, Provincial or, as the case may be, a Local 
Government Authority.  
(7) After the draft proposals for delimitation of 
constituencies are finalized on Form-5, the Delimitation 
Committee shall send the same to the Commission, within the 
time specified and in the manner as may be determined by the 
Commission. 
7.  
It appears that after preparation of draft proposals in terms of 
Rule-10, the Commission published the preliminary proposals through 
wide publicity and in response thereto, the petitioners in W.Ps.No.4099, 
4100 and 4101 of 2023 being the voter members of the constituencies 
moved their respective representation in terms of Rule 12 of the “Rules” 
whereas the petitioners in W.Ps.No.4135 and 4151 of 2023 did not file any 
such representation. After hearing the objections, the Election Commission 
passed the impugned order. 
8.  
It evinces from the respective representations moved by the 
petitioners in W.Ps.No.4099, 4100 and 4101 of 2023 that they are 
aggrieved of exclusion of certain area (Patwar Circle) from constituency 
PP-8 and its inclusion in constituency PP-9. The stance of the petitioners is 
that including these Patwar Circles in any other constituency would cause 
serious inconvenience to the voters in the process of election. The main 
stay of the petitioners in challenging the impugned order is that their 
objections have not been properly addressed by the Commission. Needless 
to observe that delimitation of constituencies is one of the foundational and 
important step to organize and conduct fair and transparent elections. The 

10 
 
 
 
W.Ps.No.4099, 4100, 4101, 4135 and 4151 of 2023 
 
 
 
Election Commission is the creation of the “Constitution” and its prime 
duty as ordained in the “Constitution” and the “Act” is to conduct the 
elections in fair and transparent manner. As already observed that one of 
the foundational step to hold the elections emerges from the delimitation of 
the constituencies which is undoubtedly within the domain of the Election 
Commission. 
9.  
There is no cavil that before finalizing the delimitation process, 
the Election Commission has to ensure that every genuine objection be 
attended and dealt with properly. As already observed that the objections 
of the petitioners in W.Ps.No.4099, 4100 and 4101 mainly relate to the 
exclusion of a specific area (Patwar Circle) from PP-8 and inclusion in 
PP-9, which in their estimation would result into serious inconvenience to 
the voters of the constituencies, suffice to observe that mere inconvenience 
of a segment of people cannot be made basis for delimitation of the 
constituencies. The suitability and proximity of an area, being part of a 
constituency is to be determined on the basis of various factors. Even 
otherwise, in order to examine the worth of the objections offered by the 
petitioners on the delimitation process, I have examined the map prepared 
for the said purpose, which also shows that the exclusion of the areas from 
PP-8 and inclusion in PP-9 was quite justifiable, in the circumstances and 
it has been done after taking into consideration the relevant law. 
10.  
In the case of SHAHBAZ KHAN v. ELECTION COMMISSION 
OF PAKISTAN through Chief Election Commission, Islamabad (PLD 2003 
Lahore 125), while dealing with the issue of delimitation of constituency, 
the Division Bench of this Court held as under: - 
“However, in the interest of justice and fair play we have 
examined sketch of the constituencies in question with the assistance of 
the learned counsel for the parties and representative of the respondents. 
It is quite apparent from the sketch that the aforesaid changes do not in 
any manner contravene or violate the principles and para meters as laid 
down in section 9 of the aforesaid Act. The said changes, inclusions and 
exclusions pertained to the area contiguous to the very constituencies to 
which they are added. It may be pointed out that delimitation of the 
constituencies is based on not only the geographical situation but also on 
the basis of the population and it is the function of the Commission to 
determine the same. We in exercise of Constitutional jurisdiction are not 

11 
 
 
 
W.Ps.No.4099, 4100, 4101, 4135 and 4151 of 2023 
 
 
 
obliged to embark upon the inquiry into facts pertaining to the aforesaid 
contentious assertions. It is pertinent to mention here that in the 
impugned order of the learned Member of the Commission it is 
specifically maintained that the modifications of the delimitation as 
made by it would achieve better compactness and contiguity of the 
electoral unit. The population has increased therefore, it appears to be 
justified for making aforesaid changes in the delimitation as otherwise 
the polling scheme and other allied arrangements will also have to be 
changed which will cause unnecessary inconvenience and uncertainty 
amongst the voters. In respect of the population criteria we find that the 
population regarding the constituencies as carved out by the Election 
Commission falls within the permissible variation and thus no exception 
in this regard can be made against the order of the Member of the 
Election Commission. The respondents have made certain adjustments 
keeping in view the increase in population and seats in the District in 
question. It is also settled principle of law that respondent has lawful 
authority to make adjustments without notice order section 10-A of the 
said Act. In arriving to this conclusion we are fortified by the law laid 
down in Chaudhry Shafiq Ullah's case (PLD 1971 Lahore 533). It is also 
settled principle of law that this Court has no jurisdiction to substitute its 
own findings in place of the findings of the Tribunals below. Moreover, 
we cannot dilate upon the factual controversy raised before us nor we 
can substitute our findings for that of the competent authority. In 
arriving to this conclusion we are fortified by the following judgments:-- 
 
 
(1) Musaddaq's case (PLD 1973 Lahore 600).  
 
 
(2) Qaisar Shafi Ullah's case (1994 SCMR 859). 
 
  
18. It is better and appropriate to reproduce relevant provisions 
of limitation of Constituencies Act, 1974 (Act No. XXXIV of 1974) to 
solve the controversy between the parties:-- 
 
"Section 9. Principles of delimitation. ---(1) All constituencies 
for Muslim seats shall, as far as practicable, be delimited having 
regard to the distribution of population, including non-Muslims 
in geographically compact areas, existing boundaries of 
administrative units, facilities of communication and public 
convenience and other cognate factors to ensure homogeneity in 
the creation of constituencies. 
 
(2) As far as may be the constituencies for election to the same 
Assembly shall be equal among themselves in population." 
 
"Section 10(3). The Commission shall, after hearing and 
considering the representations, if any, received by it, make such 
amendments, alterations or modifications, in the preliminary list 
published under subsection (1) as it thinks fit or necessary, and 
shall publish in the official Gazette the final report and list of 
constituencies showing the areas included in each constituency. " 
 
"Section 10-A Power of Commission to make amendment 
alteration or modification in the final list of constituencies. 
---Notwithstanding anything  contained 
in 
this 
Act, 
the 
Commission may, at any time, of its own motion, make such 

12 
 
 
 
W.Ps.No.4099, 4100, 4101, 4135 and 4151 of 2023 
 
 
 
amendments, alterations or modifications in the final list of 
constituencies  published under subsection (3) or in the areas 
included in a constituency, as it thinks necessary. " 
 
Mere reading of section 9 reveals that the following principles 
are to kept in mind at the time of making the delimitation of the 
constituencies:-- 
 
 
(1) Distribution of population in geographically compact areas.  
 
 
(2) Existing boundaries of administrative units. 
 
 
(3) Facilities of communication. 
 
 
(4) Public convenience. 
 
 
(5) Other cognate factors to ensure homogeneity. 
 
The respondents have followed the aforesaid principles at the 
time of issuing the impugned notifications as the learned Member' of the 
Commission vide its order dated 16-5-2002 has kept in mind the 
aforesaid principles at the time of deciding the representations filed by 
the aggrieved persons before him against the preliminary notification. It 
is also settled principle of interpretation that order is to be read as a 
whole and not piecemeal. In case the impugned order of the learned 
Member of the commission be read as a whole there remains no doubt 
that he has passed the impugned order after applying his independent 
mind with cogent reasons. Reference to para. 7 alone of the order by the 
petitioner, is uncalled for. Reading of the order as a whole clearly 
demonstrates due application of mind to the essential aspects of the 
matter. As far as practicable the criteria laid down in section 9 of the Act 
has been kept in view and adhered to, in making adjustments. The 
criteria of equality of population amongst various electoral units has 
been achieved. It is fully in consonance with the law on the subject. 
Suffice it to observe that personal wishes or choice of the prospective 
candidate for few voters cannot be the criteria or yardstick for alteration 
or modification in the delimitation of constituencies. We are, therefore, 
not persuaded to interfere with the process of delimitation of 
constituencies. 
In view of what has been discussed above, these writ petitions 
are dismissed.” 
11.  
Needless to reiterate that it is not the job of this Court in 
constitutional jurisdiction to evaluate the suitability or otherwise of the 
delimitation of the constituencies merely as per whims of a segment of the 
society. The constitutional jurisdiction is always discretionary with the 
Court and the person(s) approaching for the said purpose has/have to 
establish(s) the negation of his/their vested rights. Furthermore, the 

13 
 
 
 
W.Ps.No.4099, 4100, 4101, 4135 and 4151 of 2023 
 
 
 
constitutional mandate is not unbridled and this Court is precluded to 
exercise the constitutional jurisdiction in an omnibus fashion. 
12.  
 For the foregoing reasons, I feel no hesitation to observe that 
all these petitions are devoid of any merits. Resultantly, the same are 
dismissed with no order as to costs.
