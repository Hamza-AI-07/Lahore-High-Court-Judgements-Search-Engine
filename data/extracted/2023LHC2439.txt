ASIM HAFEEZ, J. This and connected constitutional petitions, bearing W.P. No. 
82054/2022 and W.P. No. 82066/2022 raise common questions of law, and are 
decided collectively through this single decision. 
 Controversy in nutshell: 
2. 
Grievance summed up is that petitioners, who claimed to have had 
acquired the qualification of MCPS, seek exemption from requirements of FCPS 
Part-1 (‘exemption claimed’), claiming that upon lapse of 5 years, after having the 
qualification of MCPS, petitioners become eligible for exemption. Petitioners 
claimed that Pakistan Medical and Dental Commission (PM&DC) considers and 

acknowledges the qualification(s) of MCPS, being equivalent to M.Phil., therefore, 
in acknowledgment of such equivalence, College of Physicians and Surgeons of 
Pakistan (CPSP) shall also consider and acknowledge the equivalence of MCPS as 
M.Phil., for the purposes of allowing the exemption claimed by petitioners, in the 
disciple of ‘Forensic Medicine’. Petitioners had requested for grant of exemption 
from the requirements of FCPS Part-I but declined, thorough intimation dated, 
31.05.2021, by CPSP in wake of change in the exemption rules, notified through 
Notification No. Ref # CPSP/Sect/202/70 dated 26th February 2020 (‘Impugned 
Notification’). Petitioners seek judicial review of the decision(s) of CPSP under the 
doctrine(s) of ‘legitimate expectation / promissory estoppel’. 
Respective Submissions by learned counsels: 
3. 
Primarily, petitioners claimed that respective qualification(s) achieved 
entitle them for grant of exemption from the requirements of FCPS Part-I, 
claiming that qualification of MCPS be treated as equivalent to M.Phil., being 
recognized by PM&DC, and after lapse of five years petitioners be declared eligible 
for grant of the exemption claimed.  
  
Learned counsels refer to documents showing acknowledgement on the 
part of PM&DC, affirming date(s) of achievement of qualification(s) of MCPS by 
each of the petitioners, including certificate(s) of experience issued to each of the 
petitioners. Adds that requisite fee was deposited with CPSP, hence, enforceable 
rights accrued in favour of the petitioners, which rights are enforceable in law 
under the doctrine of legitimate expectation, and same cannot otherwise be 
rendered ineffective upon claiming change in the policy regarding the exemption 
rules. Learned counsels refer to the decisions in the cases of “PAKISTAN THROUGH 
SECRETARY MINISTRY OF COMMERCE and 2 others. Vs. SALAHUDDIN and 3 others.” (PLD 1991 

SC 546), “HASHWANI HOTELS LIMITED. VS. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others.” (PLD 1997 
SC 315), “MST. FATIMA FARYAD and others. Vs. GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB and others.” (2020 
CLC 836) and “DEWAN SALMAN FIBRE LTD. And others. Vs. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN, through 
Secretary, M/O Finance and others.” (2015 PTD 2304).  
  
On the issue of equivalence, petitioners relied upon and referred to the 
‘Regulations for the Appointment / Promotion of Faculty / Teaching Staff / 
Examiners / Principals / Deans/Vise Chancellors in Undergraduate & Postgraduate 
Medical & Dental Institutions / medical Universities of Pakistan 2018 (Section – II 
thereof) (the ‘Regulations 2018’). And plead continuity of policy qua the 
exemption allowable under the erstwhile exemption rules / policy, with respect to 
the requirements from FCPS Part-1. 
4. 
Report and para-wise comments on behalf of respondents No.2, 3, 6 and 7 
are available on record, and comments submitted by CPSP, and PM&DC are 
relevant for the purposes of present controversy.   
5. 
In nutshell, it is the case of CPSP – [which authority, besides performing 
other functions, is exclusively entrusted with the powers to prescribe and 
regulate qualification(s) and requirements for the purposes of grant of 
Membership of College of Physicians and Surgeons (MCPS) and Fellowship of 
College of Physicians and Surgeons (FCPS)] – advocated by learned counsel that 
no right had arisen, nor could any right be claimed in the absence of any specific 
representation(s) made, promise(s) undertaken or assurance(s) provided to the 
petitioners, individually. Adds that exemption rules vary from time to time and no 
permanence, in respect thereof, could be claimed. Adds that petitioners are 
eligible to seek qualification of FCPS Part-I upon fulfilling revised requirements. It 
is reiterated that no direct or specific representation was addressed that terms of 

exemption rules would not alter / change, which variation was a routine matter, 
hence, no prejudice could be alleged upon change in criterion / policy, enforced 
through Notification of 26.02.2020. Adds that change in the policy was guided by 
overriding public interest and intended to forestall depreciating academic 
standards, to make specialist studies competitive and achieve academic 
excellence. Learned counsel for CPSP submits that no violation of doctrine of 
legitimate expectation / promissory estoppel was committed, which doctrine(s) 
are not attracted to the cases of the petitioners. 
6. 
The nub of the case, on behalf of PM&DC, is that qualification(s) and 
equivalence claimed by the petitioners in terms of Regulations 2018 are not 
relevant for the purposes of claiming exemption from the requirements of FCPS 
Part-I. It is categorically asserted in the report / para-wise comments, submitted 
on behalf of PM&DC, that no equivalence certificate was ever issued / granted to 
the petitioners for the purposes of exemption from the requirements of FCPS 
Part-I. 
Determination: 
7. 
At the outset, authority / domain of the CPSP to frame, introduce and 
amend exemption rules is not disputed under the purview of Pakistan College of 
Physicians and Surgeons Ordinance 1962. Policy / exemption rules were not 
impugned, nor any jurisdictional error pointed in respect thereof. No document is 
available on record to demonstrate specific representation made or assurance 
extended to the petitioners by CPSP or to establish that exemption was ever 
granted and withdrawn thereafter. Nothing is available on record to demonstrate 
that petitioners had, forthwith upon acquiring the qualification of MCPS, ever 
sought assurance or conveyed their willingness to seek exemption from the 

requirements of FCPS Part-I. Petitioners approached CPSP few months before 
change was affected in the exemption rules. Mere filing of application would not 
per se entitle petitioners to claim exemption from the requirements of FCPS Part-
I. It is inferred from the record that petitioners approached CPSP, which directed 
them to produce documents, including equivalence certificate(s) issued by 
PM&DC.  
  
When asked, learned counsel for the petitioners referred to certificate(s) of 
Recognition of Experience allegedly issued by PM&DC, and addressed to 
concerned institutions / hospital(s), where petitioners were serving / employed. It 
is notable that such certificates were issued after change in the exemption rules – 
Notification was dated 26th February 2020.  
8. 
Certificates of recognition of experience are examined. Petitioners have 
misconstrued contents of those certificates, which cannot be construed as 
equivalence certificate(s) – otherwise being deficient in material details and 
contained no reference to the factum of the equivalence claimed. Certificates 
procured cater for the requirement of certain appointment(s). Petitioners’ 
counsel emphasized that qualification(s) of MCPS be treated equivalent to 
M.Phil., based on Regulations 2018, which assertion made ignores the scope and 
context of the Regulations 2018. I am afraid that argument must fail, being 
misconceived. It is not for this court to ascertain and determine the equivalence 
of qualifications claimed upon construing the Regulations 2018, when PM&DC 
itself had categorically denied status of said certificates as equivalence 
certificates. It is expedient to reproduce relevant paragraph of the report / para-
wise comments, which reads as,  

“6. That the contents of paragraph No.6 are incorrect hence vehemently 
denied. Petitioner is trying to mislead this honourable Court. PM&DC never 
issued equivalence to the petitioner regarding his qualification i.e. MCPS 
(Forensic Medicine and Toxicology) with M.Phill (Forensic Medicine & 
Toxicology). The referred letter in this paragraph in this para only 
petitioner’s experience certificate not equivalence certificate.” 
[Emphasis supplied] 
9. 
There is another aspect of the matter. Certificates were issued after 
revision in the exemption rules – details are provided hereinbelow.

10. 
Notification was issued on 26th February 2020. In these circumstances, no 
vested right could be claimed to have been accrued in favour of the petitioners. 
Even the requirement of experience of five years was not achieved by the date of 
the notification of change in the exemption rules.     
11. 
Petitioners claim immunity from application of revised exemption rules 
based on doctrine of legitimate expectation, both procedural and substantive 
legitimate expectation. Applicability of doctrine of legitimate expectation is 
subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions, exceptions and relevant 
qualifications. Requisite conditions / requirements for determining the 
applicability of doctrine of legitimate expectation, under judicial review 
jurisdiction, are summed up as; making of specific representation, likely recipient 
of the representation made, either an individual or group of persons, detriment 
caused in wake of reliance on the representation, circumstances / factors for 
change / withdrawal of representation, if so made and acted upon, overriding 
public interest in case promise is reneged,  case of apparent unfairness, 

unreasonableness and misuse of power. In the case of R v North and East Devon 
Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan ([2001 QB 213; [2000] 2 WLR 622) three 
probable scenarios were discussed in the context of plea of legitimacy of 
expectation, relevant paragraph is reproduced hereunder, (para 57), 
There are at least three possible outcomes. (a) The 
court may decide that the public authority is only 
required to bear in mind its previous policy or other 
representations, giving it the weight it thinks right, but 
no more, before deciding whether to change course. 
Here, the court is confined to reviewing the decision on 
Wednesbury grounds (Associated Provincial Picture 
Houses Ltd. v Wednesbury Corpn [1948] 1 KB 223). This 
has been held to be the effect of changes of policy in 
cases involving the early release of prisoners; see In re 
Findlay [1985] AC 318; R v Secretary of State for the 
Home Department, Ex p Hargreaves [1997] 1 WLR 906. 
(b) On the other hand the court may decide that the 
promise or practice induces a legitimate expectation of, 
for example, being consulted before a particular 
decision is taken. Here it is uncontentious that the 
court itself will require the opportunity for consultation 
to be given unless there is an overriding reason to resile 
from it (see Attorney General of Hong Kong v Ng Yuen 
Shiu [1983] 2 AC 629) in which case the court will itself 
judge the adequacy of the reasons advanced for the 
change of policy, taking into account what fairness 
requires. (c) Where the court considers that a lawful 
promise or practice has induced a legitimate 
expectation of a benefit which is substantive, not 
simply procedural, authority now establishes that here 
too the court will in a proper case decide whether the 
frustrate the expectation is so unfair that to take a new 
and different course will amount to an abuse of power. 
Here, once the legitimacy of the expectation is 
established, the court will have the task of weighing 
the requirements of fairness against any overriding 
interest relied upon for the change of policy.” 
12. 
Lis at hand is examined in the context of the requisite conditions / 
situations narrated in the case of ‘Coughlan’ (supra) – situation depicted in first 
category is attracted as legitimacy of expectation is not established. Question of 

applicability of legitimate expectation is considered in the proximity of the facts 
involved. 
  
I find specific representation, promise or assurance conspicuous by its 
absence. Exemption rules were changed, and such change was not directed 
towards the petitioners specifically, but the policy was revised in general, 
applicable to a class / category of persons – aspirants for achieving FCPS Part-I. No 
individual prejudice is caused or convincingly pleaded. It is for the petitioners to 
prove entitlement before seeking benefit of doctrine of legitimate expectation. 
Petitioners failed to establish such entitlement. Certificate(s) of recognition of 
experience are found deficient, even if representation or assurance, was 
presumed to have had been conveyed in terms of erstwhile exemption rules. 
Petitioners claimed that vested rights accrued were frustrated by the change in 
policy, relating to the exemption rules, which claim in the wake of non-fulfilment 
of relevant qualifications does not attract doctrine of legitimate expectation / 
promissory estoppel. The claim of vested rights is erroneous. It is not the case of 
the petitioners that exemption rules were changed after the grant of exemption 
from FCPS Part-I or after registering the petitioners for FCPS Part-II. CPSP 
considered the request of the petitioners and declined to entertain request in 
wake of absence of any existing rights qua revised exemption rules. Merely 
seeking of requisite documents by CPSP for considering eligibility for exemption 
claimed does not give rise to any alleged vested or enforceable right.  None of the 
petitioners had any existing right to seek enforcement of erstwhile exemption 
rules, in absence of specific representation / assurance extended.  
13. 
Learned counsel insisted that change in the policy was petitioners specific 
and same had prejudiced their careers. It is appropriate to discuss the rational 

pleaded for change in policy, though neither any specific representation was 
found, nor presence of requisite conditions are present, attracting doctrine of 
legitimate expectation.  Representatives of CPSP were present and pleaded that 
change in the exemption rules was made based on and guided by public interest 
considerations, i.e., to elevate and improve the standards of specialized studies by 
introducing undertaking of examination. Whether requisite conditions for 
meeting public interest were sufficiently met before changing exemption rules? 
Rationality and legality qua claimed public interest need to be examined in the 
context of denial on the part of PM&DC. When confronted, learned counsel for 
the petitioners failed to establish relevance and applicability of Regulations 2018 
for the purposes of present controversy, which regulations cater for appointment 
/ promotion in Medical and Dental Institutions – PM&DC otherwise disowned 
granting of equivalence certificate. 
14. 
The scope of judicial review jurisdiction can certainly be extended to 
adjudge factum of allegations of unreasonableness – comparatively in the context 
of principles of Wednesbury reasonableness test, articulated in the case of 
Associated Picture Houses Ltd. v Wednesbury Corp. [1948] 1 K.B.223] – or abuse of 
authority and unfairness in the purported exercise of authority by the public 
body, affecting alleged private rights, but not otherwise. And unwarranted 
intrusion in the policy domain, in exercise of judicial review jurisdiction, would be 
construed as fetter on the exercise of discretion, which encroachment is 
deprecated. Elements of unreasonableness, abuse of authority, act of 
discrimination and instances of arbitrary change in the exemption rules are 
conspicuously missing – change in exemption rules was not directed towards the 
petitioners but a consequence of change in the policy and thinking, influenced by 

public interest – betterment of academic excellence and raise in standard of 
specialist studies. If argument of the petitioners is accepted it would imply that 
every medical graduate, having acquired qualification of MCPS, even a day before 
the issuance of Notification regarding revision of exemption rules, would continue 
to claim exemption from FCPS Part-I exams, under the doctrine of legitimate 
expectation, for next five years. This is absurd. This position, if acknowledged, 
would place unnecessary and unreasonable restraint / fetter on the power of the 
CPSP to modify / change the policies, claimed to be guided by overriding public 
interest. No such constraints / restrictions could be imposed to circumvent the 
discretion extended to CPSP through statutory sanction. In the cases at hand 
absence of specific representation / assurance is lacking, hence, petitioners are 
required to fulfil requirement of detrimental reliance – instance of purported 
detriment caused due to reliance upon alleged representation. To elaborate the 
necessity of detrimental reliance, in the context of the present controversy, 
reference is made to the views expressed by Prof. Paul Craig in the Textbook, 
Administrative Law (Sweet & Maxwell) Seventh Edition 2012 at page 688, and 
cited in the case of R. (Bibi) v. Newham London Borough Council [2002] 1 WLR 
237] Para 30 thereof, reproduced hereunder as,  
But he gives the following instance of a case where reliance is not 
essential.   
“Where an agency seeks to depart from an established 
policy in relation to a particular person detrimental reliance 
should not be required. Consistency of treatment and 
equality are at stake in such cases, and these values should 
be protected irrespective of whether there has been any 
reliance as such.” 
15. 
I do not find the necessity to reconcile contrast in the pleas respectively 
raised by CPSP and PM&DC. PM&DC took the position that no equivalence 
certificate was issued to the petitioners, and reliance on the certificate of 

recognition of experience was misplaced. CPSP dismissed request in wake of 
change in the exemption rules - CPSP applied criterion prescribed in terms of 
revised rules and did not consider the eligibility claimed as relevant factor, based 
on recognition of experience certificate(s) otherwise issued, after revision in the 
exemption rules. On shaper focus, pleas raised are not found mutually 
destructive. Petitioners made twofold submissions. Firstly, they claimed eligibility 
based on certificate(s) of recognition of experience, and secondly, sought 
protection against change in the exemption rules on the premise of doctrine of 
legitimate expectation. Petitioners failed on both counts. Claim of eligibility was 
knocked down by PM&DC, which disowned issuance of equivalence certificate(s) 
and claim of legitime expectation fails on merits, in wake of the circumstances / 
facts narrated and discussed. Hence, no vested right could be claimed to displace 
the effect of revised exemption rules. In view of the facts of the instant case, 
neither the doctrine of procedural legitimate expectation nor substantive 
legitimate expectation is attracted. No purpose would be achieved by referring 
the matter to PM&DC or CPSP, in absence of fulfilment of relevant qualifications 
and changed circumstances – whereby the exemption rules were revised / 
changed. Petitioners are still capable of acquiring fellowship qualification(s) upon 
fulfilling requirements / qualifications for FCPS Part-1, as prescribed in the 
impugned Notification and notifications issued subsequently. Allowing exemption 
/ walk-over to the petitioners from the requirements of FCPS Part-1 examination 
would otherwise tantamount to discriminatory dispensation, putting other 
Medical graduates, who have or likely to appear in FCPS Part-1 examination, in 
disadvantageous / unequal position – upon extending unwarranted preference to 
the petitioners in the absence of any enforceable right. Petitioners are required to 

prove legitimacy of expectation, purportedly resulting in frustration of the 
doctrine of legitimate expectation, but same are unsuccessful. The case-laws 
referred by the counsel for petitioners is examined and found inapplicable to the 
facts of the case, when relevant qualification(s), as claimed by the petitioners, are 
lacking and additionally the legitimacy of expectation is conspicuously wanting.    
16. 
While looking for the case law on the subject, I lay hands on judgment 
reported as “Regina (Patel) v General Medical Council” ([2013] 1 WLR 2801); 
[2013] EWCA Civ 327), wherein claim of legitimate expectation was allowed. It is 
apt to discuss the circumstances in which the claim was allowed, and how instant 
petitions are distinguishable on facts. Claimant sought enforcement of assurance, 
extended by General Medical Council (GMC), body responsible for registering and 
regulating the doctors in United Kingdom, with respect to provisional registration 
of the claimant, based on the qualifications achieved upon seeking assurance 
from the Council. Facts are that claimant approached GMC and asked specifically, 
whether if the claimant completes the pre-clinical course by distance learning 
from foreign university, would he be provisionally registered. GMC responded in 
writing – through email - and assured the claimant that the Council accepts the 
primary medical degree from the University in question for the purpose of 
provisional registration. This assurance was specifically addressed to the claimant, 
which assurance was materially relied upon. And in these circumstances, claim 
based on doctrine of legitimate expectation was allowed. Comparison of the facts 
of said case with the facts of the cases at hand establish that no specific, clear and 
unambiguous assurance / representation was made by CPSP to the petitioners, 
nor any such assurance was pleaded. Hence, legitimacy of expectation is not 
established, and consequently the doctrine is not available. No support could be 

drawn from the ratio of decision in the case of ‘Regina (Patel) v General Medical 
Council’ (supra). 
17. 
In view of the reasoning narrated hereinabove, I am not persuaded to 
invoke judicial review jurisdiction and procced to review the legality of decision of 
the CPSP. All these petitions fail on merits and same are, hereby, dismissed. No 
order as to the costs.
