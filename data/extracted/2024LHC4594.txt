CH. MUHAMMAD IQBAL, J:- 
On 19.12.2022, during 
course of hearing of the captioned Insurance Appeal, the 
learned counsel for the appellant presented photocopy of 
judgment passed in RFA No.1064 of 2011 titled as Premier 
Insurance Limited through Authorized Officer Vs Messrs 
Ihsan Yousaf Textile Private Limited through Director & 3 
Others (2023 CLD 135) and requested for decision of the 
instant appeal in terms of the said judgment. After perusing 
the said judgment, one of us (Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J.) while 
heading a Division Bench referred the matter to the Hon’ble 
Chief Justice for constitution of a Larger Bench to settle the 
issue:- “Whether the Tribunals established under sub-section 
(1) of Section 121 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000, are 
constituted as per mandate of law or otherwise?”  
2.  
In paragraph No.5 of said judgment supra (2023 CLD 
135), the learned Division Bench of this Court observed that 
the Insurance Tribunal who decided the insurance case was 
not constituted as per mandate of law described in Section           

Insurance Appeal No.195930/2018 
3 
 
 
121 (2) of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000. For ready 
reference, Para No.5 of the judgment supra is reproduced as 
under:-  
“5……When 
the 
above 
provision 
of 
law 
is, 
accumulatively, gone through and interpreted, we observe 
that the Tribunal, in the peculiar facts and circumstances 
of the case in hand, has not been constituted as per 
mandate of law because sub-section (2) of section 121, 
ibid, provides that, ‘The Tribunal shall consist of a 
Chairperson who shall be serving or retired Judge of the 
High Court and not less than two members being persons 
of ability and integrity who have such knowledge or 
experience of life insurance, non-life insurance, actuarial 
science, 
finance, 
economics, 
law, 
accountancy, 
administration or other discipline as would, in the opinion 
of the Federal Government, enable them to discharge the 
duties and functions of members of the Tribunal.’ and sub-
section (3) ibid demands that, ‘To constitute a sitting of a 
Tribunal the presence of the Chairperson and at least one 
other member shall be necessary.’ By using word “shall” 
the legislators have made it mandatory and any deviation 
therefrom would make the verdict of such Tribunal illegal 
and not sustainable in the eye of law. However, in the 
present case, the Tribunal was consisting of only one 
Judge (Addl. District and Sessions Judge) and no member 
having experience of life insurance, non-life insurance, 
actuarial science, finance, economics, accountancy, 
administration or other discipline has been included as 
provided under subsection (2) of section 121 ibid; 
meaning thereby the impugned judgment has been 
rendered by Tribunal, not constituted as per mandate of 
law and hence, the same is not sustainable in the eye of 
law.” 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
 
3. 
Before marching ahead, it is appropriate to peruse the 
provision of Section 121 of the Insurance Ordinance 2000 
(the “Ordinance”) which is reproduced as under:- 
“121. Constitution of the Tribunal.- (1) The Federal 
Government shall constitute a Tribunal or Tribunals in 
consultation with the Commission and shall in respect of 
each Tribunal so constituted specify the territorial limits 
within which, or the class or classes of cases in respect of 
which each such Tribunal shall exercise jurisdiction under 
this Ordinance:  
Provided that the Federal Government may by 
notification in the official Gazette confer all or any of the 
powers of the Tribunal on any District or Additional 
District and Sessions Judge of an area where for any reason 
it may not be expedient to constitute a separate Tribunal, 
and in doing so the Federal Government shall also specify 

Insurance Appeal No.195930/2018 
4 
 
 
the composition and pecuniary and territorial limits of such 
a Tribunal. 
 
(2) The Tribunal shall consist of a Chairperson who shall 
be a serving or retired judge of the High Court and not less 
than two members being persons of ability and integrity 
who have such knowledge or experience of life insurance, 
non-life insurance, actuarial science, finance, economics, 
law, accountancy, administration or other discipline as 
would, in the opinion of the Federal Government, enable 
them to discharge the duties and functions of members of 
the Tribunal.  
(3) To constitute a sitting of a Tribunal the presence of the 
Chairperson and at least one other member shall be 
necessary.  
(4) A Tribunal shall not merely by reason of a change in its 
composition, or the absence of any member from any 
sitting, be bound to recall and rehear any witness who has 
given evidence, and may act on the evidence already 
recorded by or produced before it.  
(5) A Tribunal may hold its sitting at such places within its 
territorial jurisdiction as the Chairperson may decide from 
time to time.  
(6) No act or proceeding of a Tribunal shall be invalid by 
reason only of the existence of a vacancy in, or defect in 
the constitution of the Tribunal.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
Section 121 of the Ordinance 2000 has two portions, one is 
sub-section (1) with its proviso and other consists of sub-
sections 2 to 6 whereof. In exercise of powers under proviso 
of sub-section (1) of Section 121 of the Ordinance ibid, the 
Federal Government through notification dated 20.06.2006, 
in consultation with the Hon’ble Chief Justices of High 
Courts conferred power to District or Additional District & 
Sessions Judge to perform function as Insurance Tribunal. 
For ready reference, notification dated 20.06.2006 issued by 
the Justice and Law Division, Government of Pakistan is 
reproduced as under:- 
“In exercise of powers conferred by Section 121(1) of 
the Insurance Ordinance, 2002, the Federal Government 
in consultation with the Chief Justices of High Court of 
Punjab, High Court of Sindh and Peshawar High Court, 
is pleased to confer powers of Insurance Tribunals in 

Insurance Appeal No.195930/2018

Later on, after observing prescribed modalities another 
notification dated 02.02.2007 was issued whereby powers of 
Insurance Tribunals were conferred upon Additional District 
and Sessions Judge, Lahore-I. For ready reference, 
notification dated 02.02.2007 is reproduced as under:- 
“In partial modification of this Division’s Notification 
dated 20.06.2006 and in exercise of powers conferred by 
Section 121(1) of the Insurance Ordinance 2000, the 
Federal Government, in consultation with the Chief Justice 
of Lahore High Court, Lahore, is pleased to confer powers 
of Insurance Tribunals on Additional District and Session 
Judge, Lahore-I, to exercise the territorial limits within the 
whole Province of Punjab.” 
 
Whereafter another notification dated 02.02.2017 was issued 
by the Justice and Law Division, Government of Pakistan 
which is as under:- 
“In exercise of powers conferred by Section 121(1) 
Insurance Ordinance 2000, the Federal Government, in 
consultation with the Chief Justice of Lahore High Court, 
Lahore is pleased to confer powers of Insurance Tribunal 
on Additional District & Session Judge-I at all District 
Headquarters in the Province of Punjab.” 
 
 Moreover, vide notification dated 17.10.2017 the Justice and 
Law Division, Government of Pakistan while invoking 
powers under sub-section (1) of Section 121 of Insurance 

Insurance Appeal No.195930/2018 
6 
 
 
Ordinance, 2000 established Insurance Tribunal in the 
Province of Punjab with specific territorial jurisdiction which 
is reproduced as below:- 
“In exercise of powers conferred by Section 121(1) 
Insurance Ordinance 2000, the Federal Government is 
pleased to establish two Insurance Tribunal in the Province

Earlier the validity of constitution of Insurance Tribunal or 
conferment of power of the Insurance Tribunal to District or 
Additional District & Sessions Judge under Section 121 
came under judicial consideration and this Court in a 
judgment titled as Haji Muhammad Hanif Vs State Life 
Insurance Corporation of Pakistan through Chairman (2007 
CLD 490) has held as under:- 
“4.  Section 121 of the said Ordinance makes it mandatory 
for the Federal Government to constitute a Tribunal or 
Tribunals in consultation with the Security and Exchange 
Commission of Pakistan and to specify its territorial 
limitations. Section 121 (2) provides for the composition and 
constitution of the Tribunal. Section 122 lays down the 
powers and section 123 provides for the procedure of the 
Tribunal. Section 124 provides the remedy of an appeal 
against the decisions of the Tribunal in this Court. It is 
section 122(3) of the said Ordinance which provides that no 
Court other than a Tribunal shall have or exercise any 
jurisdiction with respect to  any matter to which the 
jurisdiction of a Tribunal extends under the said Ordinance. 
Admittedly the learned District Judge, Lahore has been 
constituted as an Insurance Tribunal by the Federal 
Government vide notification dated 20-6-2006 and conveyed 
to the learned District Judge Lahore by the Registrar of this 
Court on 7-7-2006. The suit was obviously filed under 
section 9, C.P.C. This section itself lays down that all suits of 
civil nature shall be tried by the Courts established under the 
said law excepting the suits regarding which their jurisdiction 

Insurance Appeal No.195930/2018 
7 
 
 
is either expressly or impliedly barred. The said section 
122(3) of Insurance Ordinance, 2000 expressly barred the 
jurisdiction of Courts including Civil Court other than a 
Tribunal in the matter of claims under Insurance Policy. Thus 
bar was already operative when the suit was filed in the year, 
2005. The learned Civil Judge on the earlier occasion had 
correctly refused to stay his hands in the matter for the reason 
that the Tribunal had not been constituted by that time. The 
Tribunals now having been constituted, the jurisdiction in the 
matter vested in them under the said provisions of Insurance 
Ordinance, 2000. 
 
In another case cited as State Life Insurance Corporation of 
Pakistan through Chairman and another Vs Mst. Naseem 
Begum (2009 CLD 1413) the issue of the constitution of 
Insurance Tribunal through notification under proviso to sub-
section (1) of Section 121 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000 
was raised and the learned Division Bench of this Court 
validated the said notification regarding conferment of power 
of the Tribunals upon the District or Addl. District Sessions 
Judge respectively. For ready reference, para No.5 judgment 
mentioned above is reproduced as under:- 
“5. Adverting first to the contention of the learned counsel as 
to the constitution of the Tribunal, he has relied upon section 
121 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000 to contend that the 
Tribunal must consist of three members, while the impugned 
order has been passed by an Additional District Judge. We 
are afraid that this contention is wholly misconceived. The 
proviso of section 121 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000 
specifically provides that where no such Tribunal is 
constituted, the Federal Government may issue a notification 
conferring the powers of the Tribunal upon a  District or 
Additional District and Sessions Judge. It is common ground 
between the parties that such a notification had been issued 
conferring the powers of Insurance Tribunal upon a Judicial 
Officer who passed the order.” 
 
In many other Insurance Appeals similar kind of objections 
were raised which were answered by the learned Division 
Bench of this Court in a case titled as State Life Insurance 
Corporation Vs Razi-ur-Rehman (2011 CLD 746) declaring 

Insurance Appeal No.195930/2018 
8 
 
 
therein that when no Insurance Tribunal was constituted 
under Section 121(2) of the Ordinance ibid, the Federal 
Government has the powers to confer all or any power of the 
Tribunal to the District or Addl. District & Sessions Judge. 
For ready reference Para No.11 of the said judgment is 
reproduced as under:- 
“11. Adverting first to the contention of the learned counsel 
as to the constitution of the Tribunal, he has relied upon 
section 121 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000 to contend that 
the Tribunal must consist of three members, while the 
impugned order has been passed by an Additional District 
Judge. We are afraid this contention is wholly misconceived. 
The proviso of section 121 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000, 
specifically provides that where no such Tribunal is 
constituted, the Federal Government may issue a notification 
conferring the powers of the Tribunal to a District or an 
Additional District and Sessions Judge. It is common ground 
between the parties that such a notification had been issued 
conferring the powers of Insurance Tribunal upon an 
Additional District Judge at Lahore, who passed the 
impugned orders. Reference in this regard may usefully be 
made to 2009 CLD 1413 and 2009 CLD 1069. We therefore 
hold that the Insurance Tribunal that rendered the impugned 
order was validly constituted and had the jurisdiction to pass 
the same.” 
 
4. 
The Legislature has consciously inserted the proviso of 
sub-section (1) of Section 121 of the Insurance Ordinance, 
2000, whereby the Federal Government has been empowered 
to confer all or any of the powers of Insurance Tribunal upon 
the District or Additional District & Sessions Judge with the 
consultation of the Hon’ble Chief Justice of High Court but 
while rendering judgment titled as Premier Insurance 
Limited through Authorized Officer Vs Messrs Ihsan Yousaf 
Textile Private Limited through Director & 3 Others (2023 
CLD 135) the proviso of sub-section 1 of Section 121 of the 

Insurance Appeal No.195930/2018 
9 
 
 
Ordinance ibid as well as the notifications mentioned in 
paragraph No.2 of this judgment were escaped from 
consideration of the said learned Division Bench as perhaps 
the same facts or information were not presented or 
discussed at the time of hearing of the case and passing of the 
judgment supra. Under the Proviso to sub-section (1) of 
Section 121 of the Ordinance ibid, read with aforesaid 
notifications, certain powers of the Tribunals were conferred 
upon the District / Additional District & Sessions Judges-I 
who have decided the cases as Insurance Tribunals as such 
the said decisions are saved as per law. Moreover, judgment 
supra [2023 CLD 135] declares that the Insurance Tribunals 
were not constituted as mandated by Section 121(2) of the 
Ordinance ibid, suffice it to say that if Insurance Tribunals 
are to be constituted under sub-section (2) of the Section 121 
of the Ordinance ibid then sub-section (3) of the above 
provision will come into play which requires that such 
Tribunal will necessarily be consisting upon a Chairman and 
at least one Member. Thus, the constitution of Tribunal under 
sub-section (2) of the Ordinance has altogether distinctive 
qualification standards and expertise than that of mere 
conferment of powers as described under the proviso of sub-
section (1) of Section 121 of the Ordinance ibid.  
5. 
Furthermore, the matter of conferment of power to the 
District or Additional District & Sessions Judge as Insurance 

Insurance Appeal No.195930/2018 
10 
 
 
Tribunal was questioned in Writ Petition No.7364/2017 titled 
as Jalil Ahmed Vs. Additional District & Sessions Judge-1 
etc., and the then Hon’ble Chief Justice of this Court (Mr. 
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, as his lordship then was) 
vide order dated 22.05.2017 observed that Insurance 
Tribunals constituted under sub-section (1) to Section 121 of 
the Ordinance ibid were made as an ad-hoc arrangements 
which cannot be continued for an indefinite period and the 
Ministry of Law, Justice and Human Rights, Government of 
Pakistan was directed to constitute the Insurance Tribunals 
under sub-section (2) of Section 121 of the Ordinance ibid.  
However, it was held that jurisdiction conferred upon the 
District Judges-Additional District Judges vide notification 
dated 02.02.2017 shall continue to hold field. For ready 
reference, relevant portion of order dated 22.05.2017 is 
reproduced as under: 
 “4. Federation through Ministry of Law, Justice & H.R, 
Government of Pakistan, Islamabad is directed to ensure 
that three Insurance Tribunals in terms of Section 121(2) 
of the Ordinance are constituted and made functional 
within three months from today. In case the said Tribunal 
is not functional by 21.08.2017, Secretary, Law, Ministry 
of Law, Justice & H.R, Government of Pakistan, 
Islamabad shall appear in person before this Court on the 
next date of hearing. 
5. In the meanwhile Notification dated 02.02.2017 issued 
by the Law and Justice Division, Government of Pakistan 
shall continue to hold the field and the powers conferred 
on Additional District & Sessions Judge-1 at all the 
District Headquarters of the Province of Punjab.” 
 

Insurance Appeal No.195930/2018 
11 
 
 
The aforesaid petition is still pending for final adjudication 
and decision. 
6.  
We are of the view that the Federal Government has a 
valid jurisdiction under Proviso of sub-section (1) of Section 
121 of the Ordinance ibid to nominate a District or Addl. 
District & Sessions Judge to function as Insurance Tribunal 
in consultation with the Hon’ble Chief Justices of the High 
Courts and may confer all or any of the powers of the said 
Tribunals upon the District or Additional District & Sessions 
Judges accordingly. In consonance with the above conjoint 
reading of proviso to sub-sections as well as Sub-Section 4 & 
6 of Section 121 of the Ordinance show that if any defect is 
left out in the constitution or composition of the Tribunal that 
will not invalidate the precedings, act done or decision made 
by such Tribunal. Thus, the power / jurisdiction of Insurance 
Tribunals was rightly conferred to the District & Additional 
District Judge as per law.  
7. 
Further, there is another significant aspect of the 
matter that judgment rendered in RFA No.1064-2011 (2023 
CLD 135) has been handed down by a learned Division 
Bench whereas admittedly earlier decision of a Bench 
comprising equal strength/Benches of coordinate jurisdiction 
of the same Court, would be binding and if any different 
view is to be taken then the matter may be referred for the 
constitution of the Larger Bench. Reliance is placed on a 

Insurance Appeal No.195930/2018 
12 
 
 
judgment titled as Multiline Associates Vs. Ardeshir 
Cowasjee and 2 others (PLD 1995 SC 423). As the 
aforementioned facts were not brought into the notice of the 
Court while passing the judgment supra (2023 CLD 135) as 
such the findings rendered in paragraph No.5 of the said 
judgment are liable to be reversed. Reliance in this regard is 
placed on case cited as Qaiser & Another Vs The State (2022 
SCMR 1641) wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held as under:- 
“5 Although the learned Additional Advocate General, 
KPK tried to persuade us for deviation from the earlier 
judgments but it is quite clear from the judgments of 
this Court that 3-Members Bench remained unanimous 
that the prosecution is required to prove the safe 
custody and safe transmission of the sample parcels. It 
is now established that the decision of a bench of 
certain member of judges is binding on the subsequent 
bench of the same strength and if a subsequent bench 
of the same strength wants to take a different view the 
only possibility is to refer the matter to the Chief 
Justice of Pakistan for the constitution of a larger 
bench, even a decision of a bench of equal strength is 
not brought into the notice of a subsequent bench of 
same strength and it expresses a contrary view, then 
the later decision is a judgment per incuriam.  
6. In the case of Mst. Samrana Nawaz v. M.C.B. Bank 
Ltd. (PLD 2021 SC 581) it was held that earlier 
judgment of a Bench of the Supreme Court was 
binding not only upon the Benches of smaller numeric 
strength but also upon the Benches of co-equal 
strength a Bench of co-equal strength could not deviate 
from the view held by an earlier Bench, and if a 
contrary view had to be taken, then the proper course 
was to request the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court 
for constitution of a larger Bench to reconsider the 
earlier view. Smaller Bench cannot request for the 
constitution of a larger Bench to revisit the opinion of 
a larger Bench on any question or principle of law. 
View expressed by a three member Bench of the 

Insurance Appeal No.195930/2018 
13 
 
 
Supreme Court could only be changed or deviated, 
from a Bench of equal number for which the forum 
provided by law was to request the Chief Justice for 
constitution of a larger Bench. In the cases of Multiline 
Associates Ardeshir Cowasjee (PLD 1995 SC 423) and 
Wak Limited Multan Road Lahore V. Collector 
Central 
Excise 
and 
Saks 
Tax 
Lahore 
(now 
Commissioner Inland Revenue LTU Lahore) (2018 
SCMR 1474) it was held that earlier judgment of equal 
Bench of the High Court on the same point was 
binding on the subsequent Bench and if the subsequent 
Bench tended to take a different view, it had to request 
for the constitution of larger Bench. In the case of 
Union of India & others v. S.K. Kapoor (2011) 4 SCC 
589] it was held that if a subsequent coordinate Bench 
of equal strength wants to take a different view, it can 
only refer the matter to a larger Bench, otherwise the 
prior decision of a co-ordinate Bench is binding on the 
subsequent Bench of equal strength and if any 
subsequent judgment by deviating from the earlier 
judgment of equal number of bench, would be per 
incuriam. Same was the view of this court in Ardeshir 
Cowasjee and 10 others Vs. Karachi Building Control 
Authority KMCL Karachi and 4 others (1999 SCMR 
2883). Thus the judgments passed by the 3-Members 
Benches, mentioned above, have binding effect upon 
equal or less Member Benches of this Court, unless 
contrary is declared by a larger Bench of this Court.” 
 
Further reliance is placed on a case cited as Muhammad 
Jawad Hamid Vs Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif & Others 
(PLD 2018 Lahore 836).  
8.  
Moreover, as envisages from sub-section (2) of 
Section 121 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000, the Federal 
Government has power to appoint a serving or a retired 
Judge of the High Court as a Chairman, Insurance Tribunal 
with not less than two members being persons of ability with 
integrity who have such knowledge or experience of life 
insurance, non-life insurance, actuarial science, finance, 

Insurance Appeal No.195930/2018 
14 
 
 
economics, law accountancy, administration or other discipline 
and accordingly established two Insurance Tribunals, one 
Tribunal in Lahore and other one Tribunal in Multan vide 
notification dated 03rd January, 2022. For ready reference, 
notification dated 03.01.2022 is reproduced as under:-

2000), the Federal Government is pleased to appoint retired

Appellate Tribunals, with last pay drawn on contract basis for a

As the jurisdiction of ordinary Civil Court is barred under the 
Ordinance ibid to take cognizance of the insurance matter 
and Tribunals were not yet constituted under Section 121(2) 
of the Ordinance, thus as the rights and remedy of the 
citizens cannot be left in vacuum and to cater such situation a 
temporary kind of alternate arrangement / forum is provided 
under proviso of Sub Section (1) of Section 121 of the 
Ordinance.  As the power of Insurance Tribunals were 
conferred under Proviso of sub-section (1) of Section 121 of 
the Insurance Ordinance, 2000, read with Notifications 
issued by the Federal Government with the consultation of
