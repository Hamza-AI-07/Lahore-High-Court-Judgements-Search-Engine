Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J.– The Petitioner filed an application 
under section 22-A Cr.P.C. before the Ex-officio Justice of Peace, 
Ahmadpur East, seeking an order directing the SHO of Police Station City 
Ahmadpur East to register an FIR against Respondents No. 5 to 11. She 
stated that Respondent No. 5 (Dr. Hassan Mehmood) had previously lodged 
a false FIR (No. 377/2023) under section 363 PPC at Police Station City 
Khanpur, District Rahimyar Khan, accusing her sons of abducting his 
children, Muhammad Subhan Hassan and Muhammad Shoban Hassan. The 
Petitioner further alleged that on 09.04.2023, around 9:30 a.m., Respondents 
No. 5 to 9, along with Respondents No. 10 and 11 and numerous other 
police officials, forcibly entered the house of her son, Muhammad Usman, 
and arrested him and his family members, including Muhammad Haseeb, 
Junaid, and Raheel, and also seized household items. She immediately went 
to Police Station City Khanpur to report the incident, but no one listened to 
her as the SHO (Respondent No. 10) was involved. According to her, 
Respondent No.10 released all the detenues after six hours.

On 10.04.2023, around midnight, Respondents No. 5 to 11 and 
their associates returned to Usman‟s house in police and private vehicles, 
arrested Usman, Haseeb, Junaid, and Raheel again, and took them away. The 
Petitioner stated that recognizing the gravity of the situation, she and her 
witnesses, including her other son, followed the accused in their private cars. 
At approximately 2:00 a.m., when they reached an area within the remit of 
Police Station Kot Sabzal, the accused stopped. Respondent No. 11 and 
other policemen dragged the handcuffed Usman, Haseeb, Junaid, and Raheel 
out of the police vehicle and began beating them. After some time, they 
removed their handcuffs and ordered them to leave the scene. As soon as the 
men started running, Respondent No.11 retrieved a gun from his vehicle, 
and Respondent No.12 pulled out a pistol from his holster. Both started 
firing at them along with other police officials. As a result, all four men were 
killed. The Petitioner approached Respondents No. 2 to 4 to register an FIR 
against the accused, but they refused. 
3. 
 
According to the report of the S.P./District Complaint Officer, 
Bahawalpur, on 07.04.2023, Respondent No.5 registered FIR No. 377/2023 
under section 363 PPC at Police Station City Khanpur, District Rahimyar 
Khan, regarding the abduction of his children, Muhammad Subhan Hassan 
and Muhammad Shoban Hassan, against unknown persons. Subsequently, 
the offence under section 364-A PPC was added. The investigation revealed 
that Muhammad Usman (the Petitioner‟s deceased son), Muhammad Junaid, 
Muhammad Haseeb, Muhammad Raheel, Sami Ullah, Abdul Saim, Irum 
Bibi, Noreen Bibi, and Alishba Bibi were involved in the abduction. On 
10.04.2023, Irum Bibi, Noreen Bibi, Alishba Bibi, Sami Ullah, and Abdul 
Saim were arrested, interrogated, and later sent to the District Jail Rahimyar 
Khan on judicial remand. On 11.04.2023, the Investigating Officer searched 
for Muhammad Usman, Muhammad Junaid, Muhammad Haseeb, and 
Muhammad Raheel and discovered that they had been killed by gunfire from 
their co-accused in the area of Police Station Ahmadpur Lama, District 
Rahimyar Khan. Consequently, FIR No. 205/2023 was registered at Police 
Station Ahmadpur Lama under sections 302/324/353/186/148/149 PPC and 
section 13(2)(a)(b) of the Punjab Arms Ordinance, 1965. The S.P./District 
Complaint Officer reported that no such incident as alleged by the Petitioner 

Writ Petition No.1359/2024 
 
 
 
- 3 -
had occurred, and there was no police encounter in the district. Furthermore, 
the Petitioner lacked reliable evidence to support her claims. The DPO, 
Bahawalpur, filed a report on the same lines in this Court during the hearing 
of this petition.  
4. 
 
The Ex-officio Justice of Peace dismissed the Petitioner‟s 
application by order dated 17.01.2024. He noted that the alleged incident 
occurred on 10.04.2023, while the Petitioner filed the application under 
section 22-A Cr.P.C. on 25.07.2023, i.e., after two months and 15 days. The 
Ex-officio Justice of Peace found no satisfactory explanation for this delay. 
He was also satisfied with the report of the S.P./District Complaint Officer 
and saw no reason to disregard it. 
5. 
 
Through this petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”), the Petitioner 
has assailed the aforementioned order dated 17.01.2024 of the Ex-officio 
Justice of Peace before this Court. 
6. 
 
The Petitioner‟s counsel, Syed Zeeshan Haider, Advocate, 
argues that Respondents No. 5 to 11 brutally murdered four innocent 
persons, which necessitates a thorough investigation to ensure justice for the 
families of the deceased. He states that the Petitioner submitted a written 
complaint to the SHO Police Station City Ahmadpur East regarding the 
incident on 11.4.2023, but he did not attend to it. Then, on 15.4.2023, she 
lodged a complaint with the S.P./District Complaint Officer, Bahawalpur, 
and on 20.4.2023, with the District Police Officer, Bahawalpur, but they also 
did not take any action. Therefore, on 25.7.2023, she filed an application 
under section 22-A Cr.P.C. before the Ex-officio Justice of Peace. The 
counsel asserts that the Petitioner diligently pursued her remedies and that 
there was no delay on her part. He relies on Rafique Bibi v. Muhammad 
Sharif and others (2006 SCMR 512) to contend that the impact of delayed 
FIR cannot be determined at this stage as it is for the trial court to assess its 
effect. 
7. 
 
Mr. Haider argues that Parliament enacted the Torture and 
Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act No. XXVIII of 2022  
(the “Act of 2022”) to protect people against all acts of torture committed by 
public officials during custody. He asserts that this new legislation covers 

Writ Petition No.1359/2024 
 
 
 
- 4 -
the Petitioner‟s case, so she is entitled to have an FIR filed against 
Respondents No. 5 to 11. When confronted with the fact that FIR 
No.205/2023 dated 10.04.2023 has already been registered for the same 
incident and that the Supreme Court‟s ruling in Sughran Bibi v. The State 
(PLD 2018 SC 595) prohibits the registration of a second FIR, Mr. Haider 
contends that the Act of 2022 introduces a new legal remedy that creates an 
exception to this rule.  
8. 
 
This case involves the interpretation of Act of 2022. Therefore, 
by order dated 1.3.2024, this Court issued notices under Order XXVII-A 
CPC to the Attorney General for Pakistan and the Advocate General Punjab. 
9. 
 
Mr. Tahir Mehmood Mufti, Deputy Attorney General, argues 
that the Act of 2022 applies specifically to instances when a public official 
(or an individual acting in an official capacity) perpetrates the stipulated 
offence while a person is in custody. Thus, “custody” is a prerequisite for the 
Act‟s applicability. In the present case, there is no evidence that Usman and 
his companions were in police custody at the relevant time. Hence, the 
Petitioner‟s request for registration of FIR under the Act of 2022 deserves a 
short shrift. Additionally, Mr. Mufti points out that the registration of a 
second FIR is impermissible after the Supreme Court‟s ruling in Sughran 
Bibi’s case. 
10. 
 
Rai Mazhar Hussain Kharal, Assistant Advocate General 
Punjab, has supported the Deputy Attorney General‟s viewpoint and the 
impugned order, agreeing with the reasoning of the Ex-officio Justice of 
Peace. 
11. 
 
Advocate Nazir Hussain Aslam, the counsel for Respondents 
No.7 to 9, has also adopted the Deputy Attorney General‟s arguments. 
Opinion 
12. 
 
The United Nations Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) of 1984 
requires Member States to take effective measures to prevent torture in any 
territory under their jurisdiction. It also forbids Member States from 
expelling, returning, or extraditing individuals to another country where 
there are substantial grounds for believing that they would be in danger of 

Writ Petition No.1359/2024 
 
 
 
- 5 -
being subjected to torture.1 Pakistan ratified CAT on June 23, 2010, marking 
a significant commitment to international human rights standards. This 
ratification obligated Pakistan to take measures to prevent and punish acts of 
torture within its borders. Therefore, it has enacted the Torture and Custodial 
Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act, 2022. 
13. 
 
Before considering the contentions of the learned counsel and 
examining the issues raised in this petition, it is necessary to understand the 
scheme of the Act of 2022 and look at some of the provisions relevant to our 
present purposes.  
14. 
 
Article 14(1) of Pakistan‟s Constitution (1973) guarantees the 
right to dignity, while Article 14(2) explicitly prohibits the use of torture to 
extract evidence. The Act of 2022 defines torture and establishes a 
comprehensive framework to protect individuals from it during custody by 
any public official or other person acting in his official capacity. Section 
3(1) of the Act renders inadmissible any statement, information, or 
confession obtained through torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
treatment by a public official in any proceedings against the person making 
it. Section 3(2) stipulates that a public official who knowingly uses such 
information faces imprisonment for up to one year, a fine of up to one 
hundred thousand rupees, or both. However, under section 3(3), the 
aforementioned information, statement, or confession is admissible as 
evidence against the person accused of committing the offence of torture. 
15. 
 
The Act of 2022 primarily focuses on the following three 
offences: (a) torture (section 8), (b) custodial death (section 9), and  
(c) custodial rape (section 10). Section 11 provides punishment for filing 
false and malicious complaints. Section 16 of the Act of 2022 stipulates that 
the provisions of the Act will take precedence over any other conflicting 
laws currently in force. However, section 15 clarifies that the Act does not 
affect any civil remedies available under existing laws. 
16. 
 
The Act of 2022 grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal 
Investigation Agency (FIA)2 for investigating complaints against public 
officials accused of offences under the Act, but it must do so under the 
                                         
1 Article 3 of the Convention. 
2 FIA is constituted under the Federal Investigation Agency Act 1974 (VIII of 1975).

supervision 
of 
the 
National 
Commission 
for 
Human 
Rights  
(the “HR Commission”). This arrangement ensures that investigations are 
fair, impartial, and free from conflicts of interest. By involving an 
independent oversight body, the Act aims to safeguard the integrity of the 
investigation process, thereby maintaining public trust and upholding justice. 
If an agency involved in the dispute were responsible for the investigation, 
the credibility of the process could be compromised, which would be 
detrimental to both public interest and the pursuit of justice. 
17. 
 
The Act of 2022 deviates from the standard procedures outlined 
by the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (hereinafter referred to as the 
“Code” or “Cr.P.C.”) typically followed by police authorities for 
investigating offences. A combined reading of clauses (c) and (d) of section 
2(1) indicates that the Act establishes a special procedure for initiating 
proceedings. Any person or their representative with reliable information 
about the commission of an offence under this Act may file a complaint with 
the FIA. The said complaint may be oral or in writing. Additionally, section 
5(2) stipulates that if, at any time – including during the grant of physical 
remand under the Code – the Magistrate has reasonable grounds to believe 
that an offence under this Act has been committed or if a complaint of 
torture in custody is lodged, he shall order a medical examination. If the 
results of such examination reveal the infliction of torture, the Magistrate 
shall notify the FIA to investigate the offence. 
18. 
 
Section 5(3) of the Act of 2022 stipulates that the FIA, while 
investigating offences under the Act, shall have the same powers and follow 
the same procedures as prescribed in the Federal Investigation Agency Act 
1974 (the “FIA Act”) and the Rules made thereunder. According to Bennion, 
it is common for drafters to incorporate existing statutory provisions by 
reference instead of repeating them in full when drafting new legislation. 
This technique conserves space and brings in the established case law and 
interpretations related to the earlier provisions. Additionally, it benefits the 
legislative process by shortening the Bill and limiting the scope for debate.3 
This practice aligns with the legal maxim verba relata hoc maxime 
operantur per referentiam ut in eis inesse videntur, which means that words

referred to in an instrument have the same effect as if they were inserted in 
the referring document. 
19. 
 
There are two primary types of referential legislation:  
(i) simple reference and (ii) incorporation by reference.4 Simple reference 
involves the new law merely citing or mentioning provisions of an existing 
law, as mentioned in section 28(1) of the General Clauses Act 1897. On the 
other hand, in incorporation by reference, the new law makes the existing 
law an integral part of itself, as if the provisions of the old law were directly 
included in the new text. The earlier law‟s provisions are not copied 
verbatim but are treated as if they were written into the new law. This 
method fictionally embeds the referenced provisions within the new 
legislation.5  
20. 
 
Courts frequently face the issue of determining whether a 
reference to earlier legislation in a new law is merely a citation or an 
incorporation. Its resolution hinges on the language used in the new law.6 
Insofar as section 5(3) of the Act of 2022 is concerned, its language is 
explicit and unambiguous. It incorporates the specified provisions of the FIA 
Act and the Federal Investigation Agency (Inquiries and Investigation) Rules 
2002 (the “Investigation Rules”) into the Act of 2022. 
21. 
 
A detailed examination of the Investigation Rules reveals that 
they were primarily designed for anti-corruption investigations involving 
various categories of government servants. Ideally, new Rules should have 
been framed to achieve the objectives of the Act of 2022 effectively. Since 
this has not been done, this Court must discern the legislative intent and 
interpret the Act of 2022, the FIA Act, and the Investigation Rules in a 
harmonious manner.  
22. 
 
Section 5 of the FIA Act and the Investigation Rules use two 
terms, “inquiry” and “investigation”, without providing specific definitions. 
While these terms are commonly considered interchangeable, they carry 
distinct meanings in the legal context. The Black’s Law Dictionary defines

“inquiry” as “(a) a question someone asks to elicit information; (b) the act or 
process of posing questions to elicit information.”7 On the other hand, it 
describes “investigation” as “the activity of trying to find out the truth about 
something, such as a crime, accident, or historical issue; esp., either an 
authoritative inquiry into certain facts, as by a legislative committee, or a 
systematic examination of some intellectual problem or empirical question, 
as by mathematical treatment or use of the scientific method.”8 According to 
the 
Oxford 
Advanced 
Learner’s 
Dictionary, 
“inquiry” 
signifies  
“a 
solicitation 
for 
information”, 
while 
“investigate” 
denotes  
“the comprehensive exploration and scrutiny of all facts surrounding a 
particular event, such as a crime or an accident, with the objective of 
ascertaining the truth.”9 The Code defines the two terms in section 4(1) as 
follows: 
(k) 
“Inquiry”.– “Inquiry” includes every inquiry other than a trial 
conducted under this Code by a Magistrate or Court.  
(l) 
“Investigation”.– “Investigation” includes all the proceedings 
under this Code for the collection of evidence conducted by a 
police officer or by any person (other than a Magistrate) who is 
authorized by a Magistrate in this behalf. 
23. 
 
Legal precedents also acknowledge the distinction between 
inquiry and investigation. In Muhammad Bilal Nawaz v. Director General, 
Federal Investigation Agency, and others (2024 LHC 3288), this Court 
held: 
“In summary, „inquiry‟ and „investigation‟ are distinct processes within 
legal proceedings, each serving specific purposes. An inquiry refers to a 
preliminary examination or fact-finding process conducted by a designated 
authority or agency to gather information regarding a particular matter. It 
aims to assess the situation and determine whether further legal action is 
warranted. Inquiries vary in scope and formality, ranging from informal 
discussions to formal hearings. On the other hand, an investigation 
involves a detailed examination of a specific matter or allegation to gather 
evidence and determine its truth or validity. Investigations are conducted 
by law enforcement agencies or authorized entities to collect evidence, 
identify suspects, and gather information for legal proceedings. Although 
both procedures entail scrutinizing facts and evidence, inquiries are 
preliminary, primarily focusing on information gathering. In contrast, 
investigations are more thorough and structured, geared explicitly towards 
accumulating evidence to support legal action.”10

Albeit the FIA Act and the Investigation Rules envisage an 
inquiry before an investigation, section 5(1) of the Act of 2022 deliberately 
uses the term “investigation,” thus setting aside the requirement for an 
inquiry as outlined in the aforementioned instruments. This interpretation is 
further supported by the fact that the term “investigation” is used multiple 
times in the Act of 2022, while the word “inquiry” has nowhere been 
mentioned. It is well established that mistakes or absurdities cannot be 
attributed to the legislature when interpreting a statute or discerning 
legislative intent.11 Generally, when interpreting statutes, it is assumed that 
the legislature chooses its words carefully. Therefore, if a word or phrase is 
included, it is not considered redundant; similarly, if a word or phrase is 
omitted, such omission is not deemed inconsequential. A change in language 
implies a change in intent.12 It is also well settled that the legislature is 
presumed to be mindful of existing laws, and thus, the expression of 
legislative will should not be ignored lightly.13 As a result, under the Act of 
2022, the FIA does not hold an inquiry before initiating a formal 
investigation. Instead, it investigates the complaint directly under the 
oversight of the HR Commission. 
25. 
 
Let‟s now examine some of the key provisions of the 
Investigation Rules that are pertinent to our current discussion. Rule 3 states 
that, subject to Rules 4 and 5, the FIA may initiate an inquiry or 
investigation on its own initiative or upon receiving a complaint or 
information, whether oral or written. Once an inquiry or investigation is 
registered, it must be conducted discreetly to avoid undue publicity and 
prevent unnecessary damage to the reputation of any public servant 
involved. Rule 4 stipulates that the Deputy Director or a higher-ranking 
officer must verify the identity of the complainant and the genuineness of 
the complaint, but no action will be taken on anonymous or pseudonymous 
complaints. According to Rule 5(1), an inquiry against a public servant can 
only be initiated with prior permission from the designated authority, 
determined by the public servant‟s pay scale. Rule 5(2) requires prior

permission from the designated authority before registering a criminal case. 
However, Rule 5(3) provides an exception: if a public servant is 
apprehended in a trap arranged by the FIA under the supervision of a First 
Class Magistrate, prior approval to register a criminal case is not necessary. 
In such instances, a report must be submitted to the concerned authorities 
within twenty-four hours. Rule 5(4) states that if the competent authority 
decides not to initiate an inquiry or register a case upon receiving a 
complaint, it must record the reasons for its decision. Rule 6 mandates that 
the registration of a case and the subsequent arrest of a public servant be 
reported to the Head of the Department of the accused within twenty-four 
hours. Rule 7(1) stipulates that the Secretary, Ministry of Interior, 
Government of Pakistan, and the Director-General FIA may suo motu or 
otherwise call for the record of any case or inquiry pending with the Agency 
for examination and give such directions as may be necessary for the speedy, 
fair, and just disposal of the case. Rule 7(2) states that a Director may suo 
motu or otherwise call for the record of any case or inquiry to satisfy himself 
as to the correctness or propriety of a decision taken by a Deputy Director 
under these Rules and may pass such orders as he deems fit. Rule 8(1) 
empowers the designated authority to drop a case and recommend 
departmental proceedings against the accused public official. Rule 10 
provides that upon completion of an investigation, a case found fit for 
prosecution for which sanction is required under section 197 Cr.P.C., or 
section 6(5) of the Pakistan Criminal Law Amendment Act 1958  
(XL of 1958), or the rules made thereunder, shall be submitted by the FIA to 
the Federal Government for sanction of prosecution along with the full facts 
of the case, the opinion of the Legal Officer, and the statement of 
allegations. Rule 10 also contains certain provisions that must be followed in 
respect of officers in BPS-19 and above. 
26. 
 
The requirement under Rule 5(2) of the Investigation Rules, 
which mandates obtaining prior permission from the designated authority 
before registering a criminal case against an accused public official, may be 
justified as a measure to protect officials from harassment, even though 
section 11 of the Act of 2022, penalizes the filing of false and malicious 
complaints. However, Rule 8(1), which allows the designated authority to 

Writ Petition No.1359/2024 
 
 
 
- 11 -
drop a case and instead recommend departmental proceedings, is 
inconsistent with the objectives of the Act of 2022 and, therefore, cannot be 
enforced. It must be read down14 to state that the competent authority may 
initiate departmental proceedings against the accused public official in 
addition to criminal proceedings under the Act of 2022. 
27. 
 
It is well-established that criminal prosecution and departmental 
proceedings serve different purposes. The objective of a criminal trial is to 
punish the accused for their crimes. In contrast, departmental proceedings 
aim to investigate misconduct to maintain discipline, decorum, and 
departmental efficiency, thereby preserving public confidence in the 
institution. Even if a criminal court acquits the accused, it does not preclude 
an employer from exercising disciplinary powers under the applicable 
service rules and regulations.15 
28. 
 
Given the above, it is ordered that Rule 8(1) of the Investigation 
Rules shall be read down as specified.  
29. 
 
It is important to note that the designated authority cannot 
arbitrarily refuse permission to register a criminal case against a public 
official. Rule 5(4) makes it mandatory to record reasons. The decision is 
subject to judicial review. 
30. 
 
In summary, proceedings under the Act of 2022 can be initiated 
based on a complaint by anyone with reliable information about an offence, 
their representative, or at the Magistrate‟s instance as per section 5(2). The 
FIA follows procedures outlined in the FIA Act and the Investigation Rules. 
The Investigation Rules require an inquiry before a formal investigation, but 
the Act of 2022 mandates that the FIA conduct a direct investigation into the 
                                         
14 “Reading down” is a rule of interpretation of statutes/Rules. In the Province of Punjab through Secretary 
Agriculture Department v. Saleem Ijaz and others (2023 SCMR 774), the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
explained: “The golden rule behind the rule of reading down is to recognize and respect the wisdom of the 
legislature and assume that legislature would never have intended to legislate an invalid law. The same 
principle applies to subordinate legislation as it is not expected that the subordinate legislating authority 
will frame rules in violation to the parent Act or any other statute. Rule of reading down a statutory 
provision is now well recognized rule of interpretation. This rule avoids striking down of statute or rule 
which carries curable constitutional or legal vice and instead by reading them down achieves to harmonize 
the statute or the rule with the general scheme of the Act and the Rules. It is a rule of harmonious 
construction under a different name. It is generally used to straighten the crudities or ironing out the creases 
to make a statute or a rule workable. The rule of reading down is used for a limited purpose of making a 
particular provision workable and to bring it in harmony with other provisions of the statues.”

complaint under the oversight of the HR Commission. If the FIA determines 
that the accused public official committed the alleged offences, Rules 5 to 7 
and 10 of the Investigation Rules apply. The designated authority may also 
recommend departmental proceedings against him. Section 16 of the Act of 
2022 states that the Act overrides other laws, requiring the FIA to adhere to 
this specific procedure in all cases. Resultantly, even though the offences of 
torture, custodial death and custodial rape are cognizable, section 154 
Cr.P.C. is rendered inapplicable. Individuals have a statutory right to file a 
complaint with the FIA regarding these offences but, subject to judicial 
review, the registration of an FIR is governed by the provisions of the FIA 
Act and the Investigation Rules. 
31. 
 
Section 13 of the Act of 2022 provides timelines for 
investigation, trial, and appeal. Section 13(1) mandates that the investigation 
of offences under the Act be completed within thirty days from the date of 
submission of the complaint. Section 13(2) stipulates that if the investigation 
of an offence under this Act is not completed within thirty days, the Agency 
shall call for a report explaining the delay in the completion of the 
investigation. If satisfied with the causes of the delay, the Agency may grant 
a maximum of five additional days for the completion of the investigation. If 
the Agency is not satisfied with the causes of the delay, it may transfer the 
investigation to another investigating officer, who shall take up and 
complete the investigation from the same stage where it was left by his 
predecessor.16 Section 13(3) states that if the investigation of an offence is 
not completed within thirty days, the FIA shall also file an interim report 
before the Court of Session, which may decide to initiate the trial based on 
such information. Section 13(4) states that the trial of offences under the Act 
shall be completed within three weeks from the date of submission of the 
challan. Finally, section 13(5) provides that the appeal against the offences 
under the Act shall be decided within thirty days from the filing of such 
appeal. 
32. 
 
The next question is whether the provisions of section 13 of the 
Act of 2022 are mandatory. In The State through Regional Director ANF v. 
                                         
16 Section 13(2) of the Act of 2022 repeatedly uses the term “Agency,” which is defined in section 2(1)(a) 
as the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). Prima facie, this term is not appropriate for the context in which 
it is used in section 13(2). I leave this issue to be addressed in a suitable case.

Imam Bakhsh and others (2018 SCMR 2039), the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan explained: 
“To distinguish where the directions of the legislature are imperative and 
where they are directory, the real question is whether a thing has been 
ordered by the legislature to be done and what is the consequence, if it is 
not done. Some rules are vital and go to the root of the matter, they cannot 
be broken; others are only directory and a breach of them can be 
overlooked provided there is substantial compliance. The duty of the court 
is to try to unravel the real intention of the legislature. This exercise entails 
carefully attending to the scheme of the Act and then highlighting the 
provisions that actually embody the real purpose and object of the Act. A 
provision in a statute is mandatory if the omission to follow it renders the 
proceedings to which it relates illegal and void, while a provision is 
directory if its observance is not necessary to the validity of the 
proceedings. Thus, some parts of a statute may be mandatory whilst others 
may be directory. It can even be the case that a certain portion of a 
provision, obligating something to be done, is mandatory in nature whilst 
another part of the same provision is directory, owing to the guiding 
legislative intent behind it. Even parts of a single provision or rule may be 
mandatory or directory. „In each case, one must look to the subject matter 
and consider the importance of the provision disregarded and the relation 
of that provision to the general object intended to be secured.‟” 
The Supreme Court further stated: 
“Crawford opined that „as a general rule, (those provisions that) relate to 
the essence of the thing to be performed or to matters of substance, are 
mandatory, and those which do not relate to the essence and whose 
compliance is merely of convenience rather than of substance, are 
directory.‟ In another context, whether a statute or rule be termed 
mandatory or directory would depend upon larger public interest, nicely 
balanced with the precious right of the common man. According to 
Maxwell, „where the prescription of statute relates to the performance of a 
public duty and where the invalidation of acts done in neglect of them 
would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons who 
have no control over those entrusted with the duty without promoting the 
essential aims of the legislature, such prescriptions seem to be generally 
understood as mere instructions for the guidance and government of those 
on whom the duty is imposed or in other words as directory only. The 
neglect of them may be penal indeed, but it does not affect the validity of 
the act done in disregard of them.‟ Our Court has held while determining 
the status of a mandatory or directory provision that „perhaps the cleverest 
indicator is the object and purpose of the statute and the provision in 
question.‟ And to see the „legislative intent as revealed by the examination 
of the whole act.” 
33. 
 
The case Tallat Ishaq v. National Accountability Bureau 
through the Chairman, and others (PLD 2019 SC 112) is relevant to this 
discussion. While interpreting section 16(a) of the National Accountability 
Ordinance, 1999, the Supreme Court observed that the term “shall” in this 
provision, which pertains to the conclusion of a trial by an Accountability 
Court, is directory rather than mandatory because it does not prescribe any 
penalty or consequence for non-observance or non-compliance. 

Writ Petition No.1359/2024

34. 
 
Considering the above precedents and the language of the Act 
of 2022, it can be concluded that the timelines for investigation under sub-
sections (1) to (3) of section 13 of the Act are mandatory for the following 
reasons: First, a holistic analysis of the Act indicates that treating these 
provisions as directory would undermine its very object and purpose. 
Second, delays may cause destruction of evidence. Third, non-compliance or 
delay has specific consequences, such as a change of investigation. 
However, sub-sections (4) and (5) of section 13 are directory in nature 
because they do not prescribe any penalty or consequence for non-
compliance. Tallat Ishaq’s case has authoritatively settled this point. 
35. 
 
The issue of torture and custodial death can arise in three 
scenarios: (a) when an individual is in custody and is subjected to torture or 
killed. In this case, the police or the public official involved acknowledges 
that the individual was in custody within the meaning of section 2(1)(f) of 
the Act of 2022 but refutes the allegations of torture or custodial death;  
(b) when the accused public officials deny that the individual was ever in 
custody, claiming that the question of torture or custodial death does not 
arise; and (c) when the allegation constitutes a cross-version of an already 
registered FIR. 
36. 
 
Section 2(1)(f) of the Act of 2022 defines “custody” as follows: 
(f) 
“custody” includes all situations where a person is detained or 
deprived of his liberty by any person, including a public official or by any 
other person working in an official capacity irrespective of legality nature 
and any place of such detention. 
Explanation-I.– It includes judicial custody and all forms of temporary and 
permanent restraint upon the movement of a person by law or by force or 
by other means; and  
Explanation-II.– A person shall be deemed to be in custody during search, 
arrest and seizure proceedings. 
37. 
 
Section 2(1)(h) of the Act of 2022 defines “custodial death” as 
follows: 
(h) 
“custodial death” means the death of a person while in custody, 
directly or indirectly caused by and attributable to acts of torture 
committed upon the deceased while in custody;  
Explanation-I.– Custodial death includes death occurring in police, private 
or medical premises, in a public place or in a police or other vehicle, or in 
jail. It includes death occurring while a person is being arrested or taken 
into detention, or being questioned; and  
Explanation-II.– Custodial death also includes all cases where the death of 
a person after his release from custody is directly caused by and may be 
substantially attributed to acts committed upon the deceased while in 
custody.

The definition of the term “custody” in section 2(1)(f) is not 
exhaustive, as is apparent from the language of the section. The legislature 
has used the term “includes” instead of “means” and employed deeming 
clause in Explanation-II. Likewise, the Explanations of section 2(1)(h) use 
the term “includes”. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has interpreted the said 
term in many judgments. In Don Basco High School v. The Assistant 
Director, E.O.B.I., and others (PLD 1989 SC 128), it stated: “The word 
„include‟ is generally used in the interpretation clauses to enlarge the 
meaning of the words and phrases occurring in the body of the statute.” In 
Mushtaq Ahmad v. The State (1991 SCMR 543), it held: “As a general rule, 
the word „includes‟ is used as a word of enlargement and ordinarily implies 
that something else also falls within that definition beyond the general or 
generic meaning of that expression which precedes it, i.e. a species which 
does not naturally belong to it or a species which normally or naturally 
attaches to it.” Similarly, in Messrs Elahi Cotton Mills Ltd. and others v. 
Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 1997 SC 582) it was held that  
“the factum that the word „includes‟ has been employed and not the word 
„means‟ indicates that the definition given in a statute regarding a term is not 
exhaustive.” Thus, the term “includes” is used where it is intended to 
broaden the meaning of a particular word or phrase.  
39. 
 
The courts have also discussed the rules for interpreting the 
deeming clause in numerous cases. In Muhammad Mubeen-us-Salam and 
others v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2006 SC 602), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan summarized them as follows: 
(i) 
When a statute contemplates that a state of affairs should be 
deemed to have existed, it clearly proceeds on the assumption that 
in fact it did not exist at the relevant time but by a legal fiction we 
are to assume as if it did exist. 
(ii) 
Where a statute says that you must imagine the state of affairs, it 
does not say that having done so you must cause or permit your 
imagination to boggle when it comes to the inevitable corollaries 
of that state of affairs. 
(iii) 
At the same time, it cannot be denied that the court has to 
determine the limits within which and the purposes for which the 
legislature has created the fiction. 
(iv) 
When a statute enacts that something shall be deemed to have been 
done which in fact and in truth was not done, the court is entitled 
and bound to ascertain for what purposes and between what 
persons the statutory fiction is to be resorted to.”

In Dr. Abdul Nabi v. Executive Officer, Cantonment Board, 
Quetta (2023 SCMR 1267), the Supreme Court of Pakistan stated: 
“According to the Black’s Law Dictionary, Ninth Edition, Pg. 477-478, 
the meaning of the word “Deem” is to treat (something) as if it were really 
something else, or it has qualities that it does not have. “ „Deem‟ has been 
traditionally considered to be a useful word when it is necessary to 
establish a legal fiction either positively by „deeming‟ something to be 
what it is not or negatively by „deeming‟ something not to be what it is 
…” In order to interpret the statute, the court is obligated to give effect to 
the deeming provisions while taking into consideration the object of such 
legal fiction and also dredge up the rationales of statutory fiction to its 
cogent finale vis-à-vis the intention of legislature so it should not cause 
any injustice. Legal fictions give rise to explicit objectives restricted to the 
purposes which should be construed contextually but should not be 
elongated further than the legislative wisdom for which it has been 
created. In the case of All Pakistan Newspapers Society v. Federation of 
Pakistan (PLD 2012 SC 1), this Court, while referring to the case of 
Mubeen-us-Salam v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2006 SC 602), held that 
the purpose of importing a deeming clause is to place an artificial 
construction upon a word/phrase that would not otherwise prevail and 
sometimes it is to make the construction certain. It was further held that a 
deeming clause is a fiction, which cannot be extended beyond the 
language of the section by which it is created or by importing another 
fiction.” 
41. 
 
Applying the principles settled in the above and other 
precedents on the subject, it is observed that under section 2(1)(f) of the Act 
of 2022, “custody” encompasses any situation where a person is detained or 
deprived of liberty by anyone, including public officials or others acting in 
an official capacity, regardless of the legality or location of the detention. 
This definition includes all forms of temporary or permanent restraint on a 
person‟s movement, whether imposed by law, force, or other means. It also 
covers instances where a person is considered to be in custody during search, 
arrest, or seizure proceedings. Under section 2(1)(h) “custodial death” refers 
to the death of a person while in custody that is directly or indirectly caused 
by acts of torture committed while in custody. This includes deaths 
occurring in various settings such as police stations, private or medical 
premises, public places, vehicles, or jails, and also covers deaths occurring 
during arrest, detention, or questioning. Additionally, it includes cases where 
death occurs after release from custody if it is directly attributable to acts 
committed while the person is still in custody.  
42. 
 
The phrase “when a person is being arrested or taken into 
detention” in Explanation-I of section 2(1)(h) of the Act of 2022 is crucial. It 
covers situations where death occurs during an encounter or interaction with 

Writ Petition No.1359/2024 
 
 
 
- 17 -
the police when the individual is not formally in their custody but is under 
their control or restraint. Therefore, allegations of a fake encounter by the 
victim fall within the investigative jurisdiction of the FIA. The following 
observations of the Supreme Court in Ch. Muhammad Yaqoob and others 
v. The State and others (1992 SCMR 1983) are quite instructive: 
“It is true that there is no entry in the diary of the police station, but we 
cannot overlook the fact that it is not uncommon that police detains 
suspects at the police station for interrogation without formally arresting 
them … Bhide and Din Mohammad, JJ., while dealing, inter alia with the 
above question, have held that police custody does not necessarily mean 
custody after formal arrest and that it also includes some form of police 
surveillance and restriction on the movement of the person concerned by 
police …” 
43. 
 
In cases where it is admitted that the individual was in police 
custody at the time of the alleged torture or killing, the process is 
straightforward. The FIA can act on the complaint of the aggrieved person or 
at the Magistrate‟s direction under section 5(2) of the Act of 2022 and 
proceed according to the procedures outlined in the FIA Act and the 
Investigation Rules. 
44. 
 
When allegations are made against public officials for torturing 
or killing an individual in custody, the FIA is obligated to entertain the 
complaint. It cannot refuse to exercise jurisdiction merely because the public 
officials deny the allegations. It must be borne in mind that it is common for 
the accused to reject the charges. The investigating agency must gather 
evidence and uncover the truth.  
45. 
 
In Sughran Bibi’s case, the Supreme Court stated that the 
purpose of the FIR is to set the law in motion. The FIR is essentially an 
“incident report” because it informs the police for the first time that an 
occurrence involving the commission of a cognizable offence has taken 
place. Once the FIR is registered, the occurrence becomes a “case”, and all 
investigative steps under sections 156, 157, and 159 Cr.P.C. are part of this 
case. The Investigating Officer should seek the truth and gather information 
from those familiar with the incident, not just establish the FIR‟s version. A 
new FIR is not needed for additional information or new circumstances 
discovered during the investigation; these are part of the ongoing case. After 
completing the investigation, the Investigating Officer should file a report 
under section 173 Cr.P.C. on the real facts that he discovers, regardless of 

Writ Petition No.1359/2024 
 
 
 
- 18 -
the initial or other versions of the incident. The Supreme Court emphasized 
that the power to investigate pertains to the offence, not just the FIR details. 
Any information about the offence, including its background and 
perpetrators, is the informant‟s version and should not be accepted as the 
whole truth. All versions of the incident are recorded under section 161 
Cr.P.C., whether supplemental or divergent, and all of them are part of the 
same “case” that originated with the registration of the FIR as aforesaid. 
46. 
 
The Act of 2022 is lex specialis. Even if the local police have 
already registered an FIR, a complaint under the Act of 2022 would still be 
competent before the FIA where torture or custodial death is alleged. The 
precedent set by Sughran Bibi’s case does not impede this process because 
the narratives of the police and the victim party are subject to separate legal 
frameworks and investigative agencies. 
The case in hand 
47. 
 
Considering section 5 of the FIA Act, ample case law holds the 
FIA as a police force. Consequently, the FIA is subject to the jurisdiction of 
the Ex-officio Justice of Peace under section 22-A Cr.P.C.17 The Act of 2022 
does not affect the powers of an Ex-officio Justice of Peace and he can 
competently exercise them even in cases where an offence under the said 
Act is alleged. 
48. 
 
In the present case, the Ex-officio Justice of Peace declined to 
direct the FIA to consider the Petitioner‟s complaint against Respondents 
No. 5 to 11, primarily because the application under section 22-A Cr.P.C. 
was filed two months and 15 days late. Prima facie, the Petitioner has 
explained the delay in her application. Regardless, the impact of the delay 
should be determined by the trial court, as per the Supreme Court‟s ruling in 
Rafique Bibi, cited by Mr. Haider. 
49. 
 
In Khizar Hayat and others v. Inspector-General of Police 
Punjab (PLD 2005 Lahore 470), a Full Bench of this Court held that an  
Ex-officio Justice of Peace is not required to requisition a report from the 
police in every case, but when he does, it must be given proper

consideration.18 In the present case, the S.P./District Complaint Officer filed 
a report with the Ex-officio Justice of Peace negating the Petitioner‟s 
version. While the Ex-officio Justice of Peace felt satisfied with it, I find it 
unconvincing. It raises serious questions that necessitate a thorough 
investigation by an independent agency to ensure justice. Therefore, the 
impugned order dated 17.01.2024 is set aside. 
50. 
 
I have already held that the Act of 2022 is a federal law which 
grants a new remedy in instances of torture by public officials, custodial 
death, and custodial rape. Registration of FIR No.205/2023 dated 
10.04.2023 does not trump the proceedings under the said Act. The principle 
laid down in Sughran Bibi is inapplicable. 
51. 
 
The Petitioner is directed to file a complaint with the FIA as 
contemplated in the Act of 2022 which shall proceed with it in accordance 
with the prescribed procedure, as elucidated in this judgment.  
52. 
 
This petition is accepted in the terms specified.
