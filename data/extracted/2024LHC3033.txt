07.05.2024 Mr. Mahmood Ahmad Bhatti, Advocate for the 
appellant. 
 
 
 
 
This Intra Court Appeal has been filed against 
the order dated 02.05.2024, passed by the learned Single 
Judge in Chambers in the Writ Petition No.3188 of 
2024, whereby the Petition filed by the appellant under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 was dismissed. 
2. 
   The brief facts, necessary for the disposal of the 
instant appeal are that the appellant filed the Writ 
Petition No.3188 of 2024 under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
assailing the order dated 18.04.2024, passed by the 
Project Director, Project Management Office (PMO) , 
Punjab Barrages, Irrigation Department, Lahore, 
whereby, on the recommendations of the Reserve Price 

              Intra Court Appeal No.56 of 2024

Committee, the approval was accorded for fixation of 
reserve price for auction rights of toll tax collection at 
Islam Headworks for the period from 01.07.2024 to 
30.06.2025 (365-days) for Rs. 129,304/- per day and 
Rs. 47,195,960/- (Rupees Forty-Seven Million, One 
Hundred Ninety-Five Thousand, Nine Hundred Sixty 
Only) exclusive of withholding tax and Contractor 
profit, asserting that the said reserve price for auction 
rights of toll tax collection at Islam Headworks for the 
period from 01.07.2024 to 30.06.2025 (365-days) was 
too less, however, the learned Single Judge in 
Chambers vide the order dated 02.05.2024 dismissed 
the petition as filed by the appellant, hence, the appeal.  
3. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that 
the learned Single Judge in Chambers had erred in facts 
and law while passing the order dated 02.05.2024. The  
learned counsel for the appellant further argued that the 
reserve price for auction rights of toll tax collection at 
Islam Headworks for the period from 01.07.2024 to 
30.06.2025 (365-days) was too less, therefore, it 
merited  reappraisal. 
4. We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant 
and perused the record. 
5.  The perusal of the record reveals that the order dated 
18.04.2024, passed by the Project Director, Project 
Management Office (PMO), Punjab Barrages, Irrigation 

              Intra Court Appeal No.56 of 2024

Department, Lahore, whereby, on the recommendations 
of the Reserve Price Committee , the approval was 
accorded for fixation of reserve price for auction rights 
of toll tax collection at Islam Headworks for the period 
from 01.07.2024 to 30.06.2025 (365-days) for Rs. 
129,304/- per day and Rs. 47,195,960/- (Rupees Forty-
Seven Million, One Hundred Ninety-Five Thousand, 
Nine Hundred Sixty Only) exclusive of withholding tax 
and 
Contractor 
profit, 
was 
passed 
after 
the 
recommendations had been made by the Reserve Price 
Committee.  It is also a fact that the appellant is not 
even seeking the toll tax collection at Islam Headworks 
contract for the period from 01.07.2024 to 30.06.2025 
(365-days). The learned counsel for the appellant has 
remained unable to explain as to in what manner the 
appellant can be considered to be an aggrieved person. 
The existence of a legal right is the foundation of a 
writ of mandamus and the appellant  has to prove that 
he was an aggrieved person. The appellant, in order to 
obtain relief by way of a writ of mandamus, must 
satisfy the Court that he had a legal right to compel 
the performance of a duty and the person against 
whom the right was sought was under a legal 
obligation to perform the duty. A person cannot be 
said to be an aggrieved person unless he has a right in 
the performance of a statutory duty by a person 

              Intra Court Appeal No.56 of 2024

performing functions in respect of any such right. 
Only an aggrieved person can file a writ other than a 
writ of habeas corpus and quo warranto and the 
learned counsel for the appellant has failed miserably 
to demonstrate before us that the appellant was an 
aggrieved person. Reliance in this regard is placed on 
the case of Raja Muhammd Nadeem Versus  The 
STATE and another (P L D 2020 Supreme Court 
282) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
has held as under:- 
“9. On the higher plane, High Court had no 
jurisdiction under the Constitution to take up the issue 
suo motu. Article 199 of the Constitution envisages an 
aggrieved person; there was none before the Court 
besides the bar of alternate remedy. It has been held by 
this Court in the case of Dr. Imran Khattak and another 
v. Mst. Sofia Waqar Khattak, PSO to the Chief Justice 
and others (2014 SCMR 122), as follows:- 
 
"………It be noted that no Judge of a High Court or the 
Supreme Court is robed, crowned and sceptered as a 
King to do whatever suits his whim and caprice. In all 
eventualities, he is bound to abide by and adhere to the 
law and the Constitution……….It thus follows that the 
framers of the Constitution of 1962 and those of 1973, 
inasmuch as it can be gathered from the words used in 
Article 98 of the former and Article 199 of the latter, 
never intended to confer Suo Motu jurisdiction on a High 
Court. Had they intended, they would have conferred it 
in clear terms as the framers of the Code of Civil 
Procedure under its provision contained in section 115 
have conferred it on the High Court and the District 
Judge and the frames of the Code of Criminal Procedure 
under its provisions contained in section 439 and 439-A 
have conferred it on the High Court and the Sessions 
Judge respectively. Article 175(2) of the Constitution 
leaves no ambiguity by providing that "no Court shall 
have jurisdiction, save as is or may be conferred on it by 
the Constitution or by or under any law". We would be 
offending the very words used in the Article by reading 
exercise of Suo Motu jurisdiction in it which cannot be 
read even if we stretch them to any extreme. It has been 
settled as far back as in 1916 in the case of Tricomdas 
Cooverji Bhoja v. Sri Gopingath Jui Thakur" (AIR 1916 
Privy Council 182), that where the meanings of a 
provision are clear, unequivocal and incapable of more 

              Intra Court Appeal No.56 of 2024 
 
 
5 
 
than one interpretation, even a long and uniform course 
of interpretation, if any, may be overruled, if it is 
contrary to its meanings. We have, therefore, no 
hesitation to hold that the High Court could not exercise 
Suo Motu jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Pakistan. The more so when we have 
noticed that such jurisdiction has stridently been used 
even in the matters which are clearly and squarely 
outside the jurisdiction of a High Court." 
 
The learned counsel for the appellant has been unable 
to point out any illegality or excess of jurisdiction 
having been committed by the learned Single Judge in 
Chambers while passing the impugned order dated 
02.05.2024. We find that the impugned order dated 
02.05.2024 has been passed by the learned Single Judge 
in Chambers after going through the record of the case 
and 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
facts 
and 
circumstances of the case.  
6.      
In view of the above discussion, this appeal 
being devoid of merit, is dismissed in limine.
