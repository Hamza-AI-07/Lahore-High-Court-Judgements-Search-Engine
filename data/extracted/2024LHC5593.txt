MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This appeal in terms of Section 3 
of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as 
“Ordinance”) arises out of order dated 17th February, 2021, whereby 
learned Single Judge in Chamber proceeded to dismiss Writ Petition 
No.253 of 2020 filed by the appellant, seeking pensionary benefits. 
2. 
Facts in brief forming background of this appeal are that the 
appellant is the mother of Captain Aamir Butt, who has been 
martyred on 23rd June, 2009 in an operation namely “Rah-e-Rast” at 
Swat, leaving behind a widow and two sons. As per permissible 
benefits, the widow was granted special family pension w.e.f. 24th 
June, 2009, however, she later on passed away on 14th October, 
2011, after remained hospitalized in Combined Military Hospital, 
Abbottabad. After the death of widow, the appellant being mother of 
martyr officer considering herself to be entitled for full pension 

I.C.A. No.41 of 2021 
-2- 
 
amounting to Rs.13,871/- per month w.e.f. 15th October, 2011 
applied to the respondent-department but her request was not 
acceded to. Feeling aggrieved, she filed Writ Petition No.253 of 
2020, in response to which the respondents submitted their report 
and parawise comments wherein it is pleaded that after the 
martyrdom of Captain Aamir Butt special family pension was 
granted to his widow, being first recipient and after her death, the 
appellant being mother was granted pension as second life dependent 
but she erroneously claims herself eligible for full special family 
pension. The constitutional petition was ultimately dismissed 
through order under appeal. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant, while making reference to 
Regulation No.55 of the Pension Regulations, Volume-I (Armed 
Forces) 2010 submitted that family pension is intended for the 
support of all the eligible members of a family irrespective of the 
fact in whose name it stands. He added that the appellant being the 
mother of the martyr officer is entitled for the pension in terms of the 
Regulation No.49.b.(5) of the Pension Regulations, Volume-I 
(Armed Forces) 2010. In order to give strength to his contentions, 
learned counsel also made reference to Regulation No.63 and 
submitted that after the death of widow, the appellant would become 
entitled to get the pensionary benefits as previously the original 
grantee was receiving. It is emphatically contended by learned 
counsel for the appellant that in terms of Regulation No.100, mother 
of martyr Junior Commissioned Officer becomes entitle for full 
pension in absence of the widow and as such the appellant has been 
treated discriminately in oblivious of Article 25 of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Placed reliance on Mst. 
YASMEEN AKHTAR versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary 
Ministry of Defence (2017 PLC (C.S.) 703). 
4. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer submitted that there is mark 
distinction between the family pension and special family pension. 
He added that the appellant being the mother is only entitled to get 
pension in terms of Regulation No.49.b.(1) of the Pension 

I.C.A. No.41 of 2021 
-3- 
 
Regulations, Volume-I (Armed Forces) 2010. Learned Law Officer 
argued with vehemence that Regulation No.63 is only restricted to 
normal pension and the appellant cannot press it in service for her 
own benefit. 
5. 
Heard. Record perused. 
6. 
It is an admitted fact that son of the appellant namely Captain 
Aamir Butt was an army officer, who was martyred in an operation 
“Rah-e-Rast” in Swat. The officer survived a widow and two sons. 
Section 176A of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 empowers the Federal 
Government to make regulations for the governance, command, 
discipline, recruitment, terms and conditions of service, rank, 
precedence and administration of the Pakistan Army and generally 
for all or any of the purposes of the Act. In exercise of powers 
conferred thereunder the Federal Government framed the Pension 
Regulations, Volume-I (Armed Forces) 2010 (hereinafter referred to 
as “Pension Regulations”). Pension is defined in regulation 2(j) in 
the following manner :- 
“j. 
“Pension” includes, except when the expression 
“pension” is used in contradistinction to gratuity, gratuity;” 
Regulation No.32 of the Pension Regulations provides the 
classification of pensions, which reads as under :- 
“32. Classification of Pension. The pension of officer shall be 
classified as follows, namely:- 
a. Compensation Pension 
(1)  Premature Retirement Without Fault 
(a) A compensation pension is granted to a permanent 
regular officer who is compulsorily retired from service 
before the prescribed period laid down as the 
age/service limits for compulsory retirement of the rank 
he is holding and provided that the compulsory 
retirement is not due to any fault of the officer. 
(b) An officer retired as above with a qualifying service of 
not less than ten years will add to his service qualifying 
for compensation pension and for invalid pension for 
attributable disability of less than 20% (but not for 
other class of pension), the actual period not exceeding 
five years for which he would have ordinarily continued 
in service if he was allowed to complete the maximum 
age and service limit prescribed for the rank. The 
addition to qualifying service upto a maximum of five 
years shall be allowed only if the following conditions 
are fulfilled, namely:- 

I.C.A. No.41 of 2021 
-4- 
 
i. This bonus will be granted subject to the COAS/ 
CNS/CAS having satisfied himself that the officer is 
being compulsorily released/ retired from service for 
service reasons only. 
ii. The officer has had an 'Average' or 'Above Average` 
service record, excluding isolated adverse reports. 
iii. The officer is not being compulsorily retired/released 
from service on account of failure to pass the 
prescribed 
examination 
for 
promotion 
or 
in 
anticipation of any disciplinary action. 
iv. The officer is not being compulsorily retired/ released 
at his own request. 
(2) Premature Retirement Due to Fault. An officer 
compulsorily retired before completion of age/service limit for 
reasons other than those specified in sub-rule a (1) (b) above, 
will be granted actual pension/gratuity earned. 
Note: The above benefit is admissible if service of an officer 
before allowing the benefit of automatic condonation is 
not less than ten years. 
b. Invalid Pension. An invalid pension is awarded, on 
retirement from the service to an officer who by bodily or 
mental infirmity, is incapacitated for the service, or for the 
particular branch of it, to which he belongs and whose 
disability is:- 
(1) Viewed as not attributable to or aggravated by military 
service. 
(2) Viewed as attributable to or aggravated by military 
service but not disability pension falls due because of 
non-pensionable degree of the disability or because of 
unreasonable refusal by the officer to undergo surgical 
or medical treatment. Invalid pension will not be 
granted in addition to disability pension. 
c. Superannuation Pension. A superannuation pension is 
granted to an officer entitled or compelled by rules to retire 
at a particular age or after any extension of service approved 
by the Government. 
d. Retiring Pension. A retiring pension is granted to an officer 
who is retired after completing qualifying service for such 
number of years as is prescribed for the rank in the Service 
Regulations or after any extension of service approved by the 
Government” 
The terms “ordinary family pension” or “special family pension” 
though have nowhere been defined in the Pension Regulations but 
the said terms find mentioned in Regulation No.35 as separate 
entities. Regulation No.47 ordains that pension cannot be claimed as 
of right. Regulation No.49 deals with Grant of Special Family 
Pension to Widows/Parents/Children and Dependent Pension of the 
Armed Forces Officers/AFNS Officers. The most relevant for the 
matter in controversy are clauses b(1), b(2) & b(5) of Regulation 
No.49, which are reproduced below :- 
“49. 
Grant 
of 
Special 
Family 
Pension 
to 
Widow/Parents/Children and Dependent Pension of the 
Armed Forces Officers/AFNS Officers. With effect from  

I.C.A. No.41 of 2021 
-5- 
 
1 Jul 2005 and will cover all the casualties occurring on or after 
such date. The rate of their pension shall be as follow:- 
a. 
---------------- 
(1) ---------------- 
(2) ---------------- 
(a) 
---------------- 
(b) 
---------------- 
(c) 
---------------- 
(d) 
---------------- 
(e) 
---------------- 
b. The above benefit will be governed/regulated as under:- 
(1) In cases where widow is the first recipient at the 
time of casualty. Special Family Pension with one 
fourth of Special Family Pension as lump sum gratuity 
on rate applicable at next birthday applicable to the 
deceased in commutation table and 3/4th the amount of 
Special Family Pension on monthly basis will continue 
to be admissible. The children, if any, will receive 
Special Children Allowance at with-mother rate under 
the existing conditions. After the disqualification/death 
of the widow, parents will be eligible for second life 
Dependent Pension as admissible under the existing 
rules. The children will, however, receive the Special 
Children Allowance at motherless rate as provided for 
under the existing conditions. 
(2) In cases where parents happen to be the first 
recipient. Where there is no widow, the parents would 
be entitled to Special Family Pension vide Rule 49 a (1) 
and (2) (including one fourth gratuity) for life. In case 
the parents are disqualified or they die, the Special 
Family Pension shall be payable to the eldest surviving 
son/daughter below the age of 21 years in order of merit 
subject to the fulfillment of conditions. The remaining 
children, if any, will receive the Special Children 
Allowance at motherless rate under the existing 
conditions. 
(3) ---------------- 
(4) ---------------- 
(a) ---------------- 
(b) ---------------- 
(c) ---------------- 
(5) Dependent Pension 
(a) 
Parents. In case there is no wife as specified in 
Rule 49 a (1) and (2). 
(b) 
Others. 33% of pay subject to a minimum of 
Rs.350/-pm and maximum of Rs. 750/-pm 
Note:- All dearness increases/ indexation 
sanctioned in the past shall be allowed. 
The existing condition that special 
family pension/dependent pension plus 
children allowance will not exceed pay 
last drawn would remain continue but 
dearness increases/ indexation in pension 
will not be limited by the said condition 
and these (dearness increases/indexa-
tions) shall be admissible in addition.” 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
From the bare reading of both the clauses of Regulation No.49 it 
clearly manifests that when the deceased officer survives widow in 

I.C.A. No.41 of 2021 
-6- 
 
such case clause b(1) of Regulation No.49 would be attracted and if 
there is no widow at the time of death of deceased officer clause b(2) 
would come into force. The case of the appellant being mother 
would thus be covered under the former clause and she cannot press 
into service the Regulation No.63 in support of her claim, as the said 
provision of law primarily deals with the cases of normal pension 
and it carries the eventualities where the original grantee, dies or 
suffers some disqualification. The appellant is precluded to take 
refuge of said provision of law.  
7. 
So far contention of learned counsel for the appellant that 
there is disparity in the Pension Regulations relating to 
Commissioned Officer and Junior Commissioned Officer, as is 
evident from Regulation No.100; suffice to observe that Article 25 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 though 
ordains that all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal 
protection of law and also guarantees that there shall be no 
discrimination on the basis of sex but by now it is well entrenched 
principle that equality does not prohibit classification for differently 
placed prisons. The doctrine of reasonable classification is founded 
on the assumption that the State has to perform multifarious 
activities and deal with a vast number of problems. Right of equality 
of citizens is always founded on an intelligible differentia, which 
distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from those, 
who have been left out. Right of equality is always to be weighed 
amongst equal in all respects and it is not necessary that every citizen 
shall be treated alike in all eventualities. Thus in the light of clear 
distinction of service cadre and nature between the Commissioned 
Officer and Junior Commissioned Officer, the contention of learned 
counsel for the appellant is highly ill-founded. Guidance in this 
respect can be sought from SECRETARY ECONOMIC AFFAIRS 
DIVISION, ISLAMABAD and others versus ANWARUL HAQ AHMED and 
others (2013 SCMR 1687). Reference to the above can also be made to 
PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through Chief Secretary and another versus SAMUEL 
BHATTI and others (2009 SCMR 1034) and GOVERNMENT OF THE 

I.C.A. No.41 of 2021 
-7- 
 
PUNJAB through Chief Secretary, Lahore and others versus Ch. ABDUL 
SATTAR HANS and 29 others (2015 SCMR 915).  
8. 
So far judgment in the case of Mst. Yasmeen Akhtar’s supra 
is concerned, it is observed that the principles laid down therein are 
rested upon entirely different facts and circumstances as in the said 
case matter with regard to pension was to be governed as per 
mandate of Regulation No.100 of the Pension Regulations, which 
as already observed is not attracted to the present case, as the 
martyred officer was Commissioned Officer.  
9. 
The nutshell of above discussion is that we feel no cavil to 
hold that learned Single Judge in Chamber, while dismissing the 
constitutional petition filed by the appellant has committed no 
illegality at all and the order under appeal is unexceptionable. 
Resultantly this appeal fails and is dismissed with no order as to 
costs.
