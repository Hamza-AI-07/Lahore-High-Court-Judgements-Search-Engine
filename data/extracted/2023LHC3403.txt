ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This Judgment shall decide the titled 
and four (04) connected W. P. Nos. 20457, 27115, 28283 and 23256 of 
2023 involving identical questions of law and facts. In essence, common 
challenge is posed to an arrangement between the Government of the 
Punjab (the “GOP”) and the Pakistan Army, a branch of the Armed Forces 
of Pakistan that envisages the transfer of more than one million Acres of 
State land vested in the Province of the Punjab or its Departments to the 
Pakistan Army to venture into Corporate Agriculture Farming (the “CAF”) 
on profit sharing basis. The plan after passing through legal processes 
during the period of caretaker government was accorded approval by the 
caretaker Cabinet of the Province of the Punjab (the “Caretaker Cabinet” 
or the “Caretaker Government” as the context may admit) on 09.02.2023 
and formal notification No. 197-2023/0334-CS.II(IX) dated 20.02.2023 
(the “Notification”) was issued under Section 10 of the Colonization of 
Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 (the “Colonization Act”). Pursuant 
thereto, a Joint Venture Management Agreement dated 08.03.2023 (the 
“JVA”) was executed between the GOP and the Pakistan Army. The 
process of bestowing State land by the Caretaker Government to the 
Pakistan Army for CAF culminating into the Notification, the JVA and 
subsequent developments were assailed before this Court.

I 
FACTS 
2. 
 
The unfolded story revealed by the GOP suggests that in order 
to address the challenge of food insecurity, the GOP conceived the 
proposal to initiate CAF in the year 2021. The concept of CAF connotes 
large scale, systematic and organized farming to maximize production with 
improved quality. It is not limited to the management of farm and 
agriculture alone but also includes distribution, marketing, export, research 
and development, better utilization of water resources through innovative 
irrigation techniques, growth of livestock and preservation of biodiversity. 
The adverse and detrimental effects of climate change heightened the need 
to initiate CAF to bring maximum land under cultivation and optimize 
crop productivity through economy of scale and transfer of technology 
with the ultimate objective to ensure food security. 
3. 
 
The Colonies Department of the Board of Revenue, Punjab 
(the “BOR”) submitted a summary to the elected government headed by 
the then Chief Minister, Punjab on 25.06.2021 proposing Statement of 
Conditions (the “SOCs”) for CAF. Subsequently, the summary was placed 
before the elected Cabinet of the Province of Punjab (the “Elected 
Cabinet” or “Elected Government” as the context may admit) in its 51st 
meeting held on 28.02.2022 under Agenda No. 19 titled as, “Terms & 
Conditions for Corporate Farming under CPEC”. The term CPEC is an 
abbreviation of ‘China Pakistan Economic Corridor’ and refers to a long-
term initiative between the Federation of Pakistan (the “FOP” or the 
Federal Government as the context may admit) and People’s Republic of 
China involving multiple projects. The Senior Member, Board of Revenue, 
Punjab (the “SMBR”) briefed the Elected Cabinet that the GOP had 
decided to promote CAF on accessible cultivable / fellow State wasteland. 
Accordingly, the matter was examined by the BOR and following SOCs 
were proposed:-

the Standing Committee of Cabinet on Legislative Business (the 
“Standing Committee”) who considered the same in its meeting held on 
30.09.2021 and in principle approved the same under the CPEC. It was 
importantly recommended by the Standing Committee that the matter be 
placed before the Elected Cabinet for consideration after legal vetting of 
the draft terms and conditions by Law & Parliamentary Affairs 
Department and in addition, the same may also be placed before the 
Provincial Assembly for discussion subsequently. During the process of 
discussion, the SMBR clarified that the proposal included barren State land 
only which will be included in the schedule and the purpose of the 
proposal was to attract foreign investment with special focus on transfer of 
technology, enhancement in productivity and local employment. The 
proposal was not limited to CPEC only. The Elected Cabinet considered

Statedly, meeting of Ministerial Committee was held on 
14.10.2022 but admittedly, no minutes of the meeting were recorded.  To 
address the Court query, reliance was placed on file noting coupled with an 
attendance sheet dated 14.10.2022 to demonstrate that such a meeting had 
in fact taken place. However, it was claimed that SOCs were approved in 
the Ministerial Committee, whereafter, the draft of SOCs was forwarded to 
Secretaries of Agriculture, Livestock and Law Departments of the GOP for 
their input and further necessary action. Admittedly, only one Minister 
attended the meeting as per attendance sheet dated 14.10.2022. The image 
of the same is pasted as under:-

After dissolution of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 
the Caretaker Cabinet was installed on 22.01.2023. On 08.02.2023, the 
Director 
General, 
Strategic 
Projects, 
Pakistan 
Army, 
General 
Headquarters, Adjutant General’s Branch, Rawalpindi (the “DGSP”) 
(represented in the titled and connected Petitions through the Ministry of 
Defence, Islamabad) directly wrote a letter to the SMBR claiming that the 
Pakistan Army has rich experience of developing waste barren land placed 
on military schedule and has developed a comprehensive land 
development strategy. Accordingly, an offer was made to take land for 
CAF and proposed a joint meeting with the concerned Departments to 
discuss its modalities. The text of the proposal contained in paragraph No. 
3 of the said letter is as under:- 
 
“3. Agreed Operational Modalities can be mutually worked 
out with Punjab Government, as main stakeholder, in the best 
interest of the country. However, suggested timeline to 
Initiate the project is as under- 
 
a. Pilot Project - Immediately (10,000 - 15,000 Acre), the 
earmarked land should be in following categories:- 
 
(1) Irrigated by canal.  
(2) TW Irrigated. 
(3)  Pond irrigated. 
 
b. Main Project-1 March 2023 (1 Lac Acre)  
c. Identification and Lease of 1 Million Acre in Cholistan 
Development Authority area of responsibility-April 2023.” 
 
7. 
 
The following day, in furtherance of claimed purported 
approval of SOCs by the Ministerial Committee, the matter was placed 
before the Caretaker Cabinet in its 4th meeting held on 09.02.2023 under 
Agenda No. 3. The SMBR apprised the Caretaker Cabinet that in the light 
of approval of Ministerial Committee and feedback of Agriculture, 
Livestock and Law Departments, SOCs were proposed for approval.

Accordingly, the Caretaker Cabinet considered and approved the proposed 
SOCs mentioned at para 3.3 with the following amendments:  
 
“Under the heading of “lease through single source” 
(i) 
Para 5(1)(c): The provision of having one local 
company as a partner by the foreign companies were 
deleted. 
 
(ii)

The Board of Revenue, Punjab, vide letter No.197-
2023/338- CS.II(IX), dated 13.03.2023, requested the 
Secretaries, Agriculture, L&DD, FW&F and Irrigation 
Departments to furnish views about the above-detailed land of 
their department. 
 
6. 
The L & DD Department proposed the land for 
handover under Livestock Experiments Station (LES) at Rakh 
Ghulaman measuring 7316 acres out of 10273 acres, at Rakh 
Mahni land measuring 7472 acres out of 9424 and at Chak 61 
MB, Khushab land measuring 349 acres out of 981 acres 
proposed by the Pakistan Army. 
 
7. 
According to the FW & F Department, the Statement of 
Conditions on Corporate Agriculture Farming (CAF) was 
approved subject to federal / provincial law compliance. The 
Forest Act of 1927 states that forest land can only be used for 
afforestation.  
 
8. 
The Agriculture Department was of the view that their 
department had given its consent and focal persons had been 
nominated for handing over the land to the Pakistan Army. 
 
DECISIONS: 
It was decided that requisite assets of the L&DD Department 
and Agriculture Department be handed over to Pakistan Army 
for the CAF initiative. It was also decided that all departments 
will submit proposals for any land or assets needed for 
Research and Development Projects, along with details of 
objectives i.e. project name, purpose of the project, land 
required for attainment of objective, funds required, and time 
required to complete the project etc. The Pakistan Army will 
return the required land/assets to the departments for such 
research 
and 
development 
projects/proposals. 
The 
departments 
concerned 
may 
however 
develop 
joint 
management or collaborative arrangements with Pakistan 
Army for the projects. 
 
It was also decided that:- 
 
(a) Staff/assets of departments concerned may also be part of 
the project after due consultation with the department 
concerned.  
 
(b) Government of the Punjab will only pay the monthly 
salary to the staff.

Later, the Colonies Department of the BOR accorded five 
sanctions for leasing out State land in Districts Sahiwal, Khushab and 
Bhakkar vide letters dated 29.03.2023 in favour of the Pakistan Army, 
GHQ Rawalpindi, Ministry of Defence, Government of Pakistan  with 
respect to CAF for a period of 20 years extendable for another period of 10 
years under the new SOCs notified vide impugned Notification in 
compliance with the minutes of 7th meeting of the Caretaker Cabinet dated 
25.02.2023 and the JVA. It was directed that the ownership would remain 
with the GOP, necessary entries be incorporated in cultivation column and 
the Pakistan Army / Ministry of Defence would be a lessee subject to the 
condition that the land will be utilized only for the purpose it is being 
leased out and would be reverted to the Colonies Department when no 
longer required for the purpose or on expiry of lease period without any 
compensation. It was further directed that lease deed in the prescribed 
form may be executed, stamped and registered at the expense of the lessee 
by incorporating the necessary terms and conditions mentioned in the new 
SOCs and the JVA.

NATURE OF GRIEVANCES 
14. 
 
The titled Petition was instituted by Public Interest Law 
Association of Pakistan registered under the Societies Act, 1860 through 
its duly authorized Member, Mr. Ahmad Rafay Alam, Advocate. The 
objects stipulated in its Memorandum of Association, inter alia, include to 
promote and pursue public interest litigation in Pakistan; endeavour to

protect human, public and fundamental rights; seek to provide effective 
judicial protection to the weaker sections of the society; to improve 
government accountability and transparency; improve governance at all 
levels of government and its Departments; and uphold that the State 
functionaries abide by the Rule of Law and the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”). The Petitioner was 
intrigued when the revelation of an arrangement of CAF between the GOP 
and the Pakistan Army surfaced in a news report of the daily Dawn on 
21.03.2023. Hence, the challenge was brought vis-à-vis the constitutional 
and legal mandate of the Pakistan Army and the Caretaker Cabinet 
regarding the purported arrangement coupled with the prayer to set aside 
the Notification and all subsequent developments and pass consequential 
directions under the Doctrine of Public Trust. 
15. 
 
W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 was also instituted in public interest 
by the Petitioner, Mr. Shahid Shahood Randhawa who is an Advocate by 
profession and naturally has an interest in the preservation and protection 
of Rule of Law and the Constitution. CAF arrangement was questioned on 
identical lines and premises as in the titled Petition.   
16. 
 
In W. P. No. 20457 / 2023, it was submitted that vide 
notification dated 15.03.2023 issued by Secretary Colonies, BOR, a 
livestock farm established in the year 1953-54 for dairy development and 
poultry farming spread over 100 Acres of land built with public money 
under the Colombo Plan and hosting a number of business projects has 
been included in the land allocated to the Pakistan Army for CAF. 
Accordingly, it was prayed that a direction may be passed against the 
Respondents to exclude the livestock farm ‘Ghulama’s Establishment, 
District Bhakkar’ from its handing over to the Pakistan Army for CAF.  
17. 
 
Conversely, the concerned Respondent / Livestock and Dairy 
Development Department in its report and para wise comments submitted 
that the Department is running a network of livestock farms across the 
Province of Punjab. The purpose of these farms is to conserve livestock

genetic resources; production and propagation of superior germ plasm; 
human resource development through education and capacity building of 
staff and farmers; and undertaking research and development in 
collaboration with academia. However, these farms are not being utilized 
efficiently due to lack of access to modern technologies, inadequate 
finances and shortage of skilled labour. Moreover, the farms have vast area 
which is beyond actual requirement and remains underutilized. CAF can 
address these challenges by introducing modern technologies and 
innovative practices leading to increased productivity and improved yields. 
CAF has emerged as a viable solution for achieving greater agricultural 
and livestock productivity. The large scale commercial farming operations 
have potential to achieve the economy of scale. Global Halal Food Market 
consists of about three trillion Dollars in which Pakistan has very 
negligible share of 0.1%. As such, the livestock farm has been included in 
CAF arrangement contemplated by the GOP.   
18. 
 
Writ Petition No. 27115 / 2023 was filed by Major (R) 
Muhammad Ghulam Sarwar, former Member of the Provincial Assembly 
of the Punjab against the Notification and the letter dated 10.03.2023 with 
respect to CAF. As a distinguishing feature, it was submitted that on 
07.12.2021, land measuring 800 Kanals out of 725 Acres was sanctioned 
by the BOR in favour of the Livestock and Dairy Development 
Department, GOP for the establishment of sub-campus of University of 
Veterinary & Animal Sciences at Chichawatni, District Sahiwal for which 
public funds had also been allocated and development work had been 
initiated. However, the required entries were not made in the revenue 
record in the name of the concerned Department. The said land along with 
its project has been included in the land proposed to be handed over to the 
Pakistan Army for CAF. Accordingly, it was prayed that the impugned 
Notification and letter be set aside being contrary to notification dated 
07.12.2021.

In rebuttal of concerned Livestock and Dairy Development 
Department, it was informed that a development scheme “Establishment of 
sub-campus of University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences at 
Chichawatni” was incorporated in Annual Development Plan 2021-22. 
Consequently, the Department engaged the University of Veterinary and 
Animal Sciences and directed to formulate and submit PC-1 regarding the 
said development project which was submitted before PDWP for 
consideration, accordingly. It was discussed by Planning and Development 
Board in its PDWP meeting held on 07.09.2021. It was directed to carry 
out the feasibility study of the project prior to its final approval. 
Meanwhile, 100 Acres of State land out of total 725 Acres located at Chak 
No. 13 / 11-L, Chichawatni was provided by the Colonies Department to 
Livestock and Dairy Development, Punjab for the purpose vide letter No. 
2960-2021/3880-CS(II) dated 07.12.2021. The feasibility study of the 
project was completed. However, meeting was held by Planning and 
Development Board regarding rationalization of development portfolio of 
production sector wing, wherein, the instant scheme was capped by the 
competent authority / forum vide letter No. 8(2)/AC(Food)P&D/2022-23 
dated 13.02.2023. It was apprised that although the funds were allocated 
during the current financial year in the Annual Development Plan yet the 
same were not released due to the present unapproved status of the project. 
Hence, 100 Acres of land were still vacant and no development work or 
activities were in progress at the site. Consequently, the said land was at 
the disposal of the Department for further consideration and can be handed 
over by the GOP through the BOR to any person or Department or entity 
of the government under the policy of the BOR. 
20. 
 
W. P. No. 28283 / 2023 was pressed by 167 (one hundred and 
sixty seven) Petitioners impugning the Notification and Letter dated 
15.03.2023 for transferring of land to the Pakistan Army. Additionally, it 
was stated that the dispute relates to sandy land which consists of sand 
dunes and banjar State land in District Bhakkar where cultivation is

difficult. In order to develop land, various schemes were introduced by the 
Thal Development Authority (the “TDA”) and lands were taken over 
under the provisions of Thal Development Act, 1949 which are liable to be 
resumed to the land owners in accordance with the provisions of Section 
21 thereof. In the process of development of land, Rakhs were created, 
namely, Rakh Ghulaman and Rakh Qasor in Tehsil Klur Kot, District 
Bhakkar. Rakh signifies an area reserved for a special purpose. Some area 
within the said Rakhs was reserved for specific purpose of dairy items and 
livestock to cater the needs of the local inhabitants. However, the excess 
area was given to various persons including the Petitioners for breaking the 
same and making it neuter. Certain facilities were provided including the 
creation of Chaks. The Petitioners have been cultivating the aforesaid area 
since their forefathers, made it cultivable and are regularly paying 
governmental dues. Various schemes were formulated for granting 
proprietary rights to the persons in possession of State land but the 
Petitioners have not been granted proprietary rights till today, perhaps for 
the reason that Rakhs area was reserved for a specific purpose of dairy and 
livestock. The Petitioners claimed that the area in excess of specified 
purpose of Rakhs under possession of the Petitioners is liable to automatic 
reversion to the State and as such, they are entitled to get proprietary rights 
in accordance with Notification dated 19.03.1995. Notwithstanding the 
same, pending determination of the claim of proprietary rights, the 
Petitioners are continuing possession over the land. Lately, the 
Respondents included the land under lawful possession of the Petitioners 
and specified for Rakhs in the land proposed for CAF to the Pakistan Army 
and are being threatened with dispossession. 
21. 
 
The stance of the concerned Respondents was that according 
to instructions contained in Order No. Thal/LHR/G-104/2261-68 dated 
24.05.1971 issued by the Administrator, TDA, undisposed agricultural 
land of the TDA was placed under the control of the Colonies Department. 
Land measuring 10,273 Acres is under the possession of Rakh Ghulaman

Livestock & Dairy Development Farm which was managed by the 
Livestock & Dairy Development Department. State land is owned by the 
GOP and allotted under the policy framed by it. There is no policy for 
lease of State land to any individual and State land is disposed of through 
restricted auction under Temporary Cultivation Lease Scheme (the 
“TCLS”). The Petitioners cannot become tenants on the basis of mere 
possession. Proprietary rights are conferred to those persons who hold 
legitimate lease under the TCLS issued from time to time by the Colonies 
Department and subsequently, held entitled for grant of proprietary rights 
in accordance with the terms and conditions of applicable notifications 
issued from time to time including Notification No. 1289-1995/843-CL-I, 
dated 19.03.1995. However, the Petitioners are not lease holders under any 
TCLS and as such, cannot be granted proprietary rights and have no claim 
over the land in question. Hence, the Colonies Department as custodian of 
State land in terms of the Punjab Government Rules of Business, 2011 (the 
“Rules, 2011”) lawfully included land in question for CAF for the Pakistan 
Army in the light of new SOCs issued with the approval of the GOP. 
However, during arguments, learned Assistant Advocate General conceded 
that the Petitioners are Patadars of Livestock & Dairy Development 
Department for animal breeding.  
 
III. 
CONTENTIONS OF THE PETITIONERS 
22. 
 
Mr. Fahad Malik led the arguments. Addressing the objection 
of maintainability, he submitted that Petitioner (Public Interest Law 
Association of Pakistan) is a registered society under the Societies Act, 
1860 and the objects of its Memorandum of Association empower it to 
institute the titled Petition in public interest. The Petitioner has a 
remarkable record in this regard and has successfully challenged the State 
excesses in projects like the Ravi Riverfront City formulated under the 
Ravi Urban Development Project, as well as the elevated Expressway 
Lahore Project. The impugned arrangement relates to the lease of more

than one million Acres of public property and the Petitioner has initiated 
the instant proceedings as pro bono publico to ensure that public property 
is dealt with strictly in accordance with law since not doing so would result 
in grave violations of the fundamental rights of the people of Pakistan in 
general, and the citizens of Punjab in particular, including, but not limited 
to, violations of Articles 9, 10A, 14, 18, 19A, 24, 25, 37 and 38 of the 
Constitution. 
23. 
 
The jurisprudence regarding such cases relating to the mode 
and manner in which public property is to be dealt with has received 
liberal interpretation over the years. He quoted paragraph No. 28 from 
Habibullah Energy Limited1 case to substantiate his point, wherein, the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan after going through several judgments passed 
by the constitutional Courts in Pakistan and India concluded as follows: 
“An overview of the judgments reproduced or referred to 
herein above leaves little room for doubt that it is now a well-
settled principle of law that all public functionaries must 
exercise public authority, especially while dealing with the 
public property, public funds or assets in a fair, just, 
transparent and reasonable manner, untainted by mala fide 
without discrimination and in accordance with law, keeping in 
view the Constitutional Rights of the Citizens. This would 
hold true even in the absence of any specific statutory 
provisions setting forth the process in this behalf. Therefore, it 
is not really relevant whether the transaction in question was 
governed by the Ordinance, 2000 or the-Rules, 2004 or 
neither. It is an equally well settled principle of law that such 
actions of public functionaries are always subject to Judicial 
Review. No doubt, while exercising its jurisdiction, the 
Superior Courts neither sit in appeal over the administrative 
actions nor interfere on account of inconsequential deviations, 
as has been observed in Dr. Akhtar Hassan Khan's case 
(supra). However, where the administrative authority acts in a 
discriminatory manner and action fails the test of 
reasonableness, transparency and/or is otherwise unjust and 
unfair or suffer from mala fide, the Courts not only are vested 
with the jurisdiction to set aside such action but any failure in 
such an eventuality to exercise the power of Judicial Review,

when invoked, would make the Court a party to such 
unreasonable, unfair, mala fide and illegal action.” 
  
24. 
 
He emphasized that Atta Ullah Khan2 case extensively 
reviewed several judgments passed by the Superior Courts with reference 
to the principles applicable in determining maintainability of a Petition 
filed as pro bono publico with reference to the disposal of public property 
by the State institutions. The following excerpts detail the main findings in 
the case:  
“15. It is settled on good authority that in matters pertaining to 
public interest litigation (also known as "PIL") the rule of 
"standing" or "locus standi" or "aggrieved person" has 
received a liberal interpretation over the years and any 
person/citizen having "sufficient interest" (in the context of 
larger public interest) can maintain a petition and pass as an 
"aggrieved person" under Article, 199 of the Constitution, 
subject to satisfying other requirements of the said Article. 
  
16. Any citizen or person (part of the public) has "sufficient 
interest" and is, therefore, an aggrieved person under Article 
199 of the Constitution, if public property is being acquired, 
held, used, or disposed of by public functionaries in violation 
of the law. Public functionaries as trustees of the people, 
cannot have any personal interest in any public property, 
therefore, if there is any abuse of trust or violation of law, it 
qualifies any member of the general public as an "aggrieved 
person" with the right to invoke the constitutional jurisdiction 
of this Court, subject to fulfilling other requirements of 
Article 199. 
  
17. The significance of public interest litigation has special 
importance in our country. Even after 63 years of 
Independence, we still have fledgling public institutions 
because unfortunately they could not be nurtured under the 
shade of democracy due to repeated usurpation of our 
political space by unelected forces. Lack of democracy over 
years has taken a toll on our institutions. Absence of basic 
democratic values and democratic culture within public 
institutions threatens rule of law and due process breeding 
unchecked corruption. Disappointed with the undemocratic 
mindset of public functionaries, people have time and again

resorted to courts for judicial review through public interest 
litigation. 
  
18. It is essential for the public functionaries to understand the 
importance and meaning of a democratic welfare state. "What 
is democracy? ...It rests on two bases. The first is the 
sovereignty of the people. This sovereignty is exercised in 
free elections, held on regular basis, in which the people 
choose their representatives, which in turn represent their 
views. This aspect of democracy is manifested in majority 
rule and in the centrality of the legislative body through which 
the people's representatives act. This is the formal aspect of 
democracy. It is of central importance, since without it the 
regime is not democratic...The second aspect of democracy is 
reflected in the rule of values (other than the value of majority 
rule) that characterize democracy. The most important of 
these values are separation of powers, the rule of law, judicial 
independence, human rights, and basic principles that reflect 
yet other values (such as morality and justice), social 
objectives (such as the public peace and security), and 
appropriate ways of behaviour (reasonableness good faith). 
This aspect of democracy is the rule of democratic values. 
This is a substantive aspect of democracy. It too is of central 
importance. Without it the regime is not democratic. 
  
21. Public Interest Litigation is therefore a judicial tool to 
help resurrect or jump start public institutions on the road to 
healthy democratic values and traditions. Unless substantive 
democracy takes root in our public administration and our 
institutions flourish with democratic maturity, court dockets 
will continue to be filled with public interest litigation. 
However, the courts will continue to redress public grievance, 
with the hope that public institutions will soon come of age. 
  
22. The real test, therefore, in Public Interest Litigation is the 
subject-matter of the petition or the abuse of public trust 
complained of. Once the court assesses that breach of trust 
and violation of law by a public institution has taken place, 
the court must. immediately proceed further to rectify the 
breach, the identity or antecedents of the petitioner pale into 
insignificance. If, on the other hand, the court finds the 
petition to be without merit, camouflaged to foster personal 
disputes, said petition is to be thrown out. Public Interest 
Litigation should not be allowed to be "Publicity Interest 
Litigation" or "Private Interest Litigation" or "Politics Interest 
Litigation". Reliance is placed on Ashok Kumar Pandey v.

State of West Bengal and others (AIR 2004 SC 280). 
However, if the court is convinced that violation of law has 
taken place pertaining to public property or public interest, it 
should matter less who brought the complaint before the 
Court. Locus standi in such matters stands diluted carrying 
only cosmetic significance. This is also so because, Public 
Interest Litigation converts adversarial nature of the 
proceedings into inquisitorial proceedings. The Court, as 
guardian of public interest investigates to decipher the truth. 
This unique remedy is the hallmark of a welfare democratic 
State, which rests on the principles of social and economic 
justice enshrined in our Constitution. 
  
25. Right to information is another corrective tool, which 
allows public access to the working and decision making of 
the public authorities. It opens the working of public 
administration to public scrutiny. This necessitates transparent 
and structured exercise of discretion by the public 
functionaries. Article 19A empowers the civil society of this 
country to seek information from public institutions and hold 
them answerable. Article 19A, therefore, enthuses fresh life 
into Public Interest Litigation. 
  
26. The rules of standing/locus standi have a close connection 
and nexus with the rule of law. Closing the doors of the court 
on a petitioner who warns of a public institution's unlawful 
action means giving that public body a free hand to act 
without fear of judicial review.”

In Arshad Waheed3 case, this Court held that even though the 
Petition before the Court may not have been otherwise maintainable on 
merits, if violations in the disposal of public property and breach of public 
trust by public functionaries have been observed, this Court is obligated to 
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and in the circumstances, do 
right with all manner of people, without fear and favour. 
“36. Non-maintainability of the petition and the power of this 
Court to proceed further 
  
Non-maintainability of the petition on merits does not oust the 
jurisdiction of this Court to address other violations of public 
law which have come to fore during the course of arguments 
on the petition and after the perusal of the record. Stark

violations in the disposal and transfer of public property and 
heartless breach of public trust by the public functionaries 
(public trustees) cannot be overlooked. This Court is under 
oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and in all 
circumstances do right to all manner of people without fear 
and favour. For the Court to dismiss the petition on the 
ground of maintainability alone would not only result in 
failure of justice, it would also make the Court and its 
constitutional jurisdiction hostage to technicalities, which 
cannot be allowed. Once grave violation of law and 
transparency in the disposal/transfer of public property comes 
before this court, it transforms the lis into public interest 
litigation conferring inquisitorial jurisdiction on this Court. 
No constitutional court can shy away from fully discharging 
this responsibility. It is useful here to revisit Article 
199(1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution, which provides that on as 
application of the aggrieved person, the court can make an 
order "declaring that any act done or proceedings taken within 
the territorial jurisdiction of the Court have been done or 
taken without lawful authority and is of no legal affect". 
Again, under Article 199(1)(c) this Court can "make an order 
giving such directions to any person" within territorial 
jurisdiction of the Court for enforcement of fundamental 
rights conferred under the Constitution. These are loud 
reminders of the jurisdictional expanse enjoyed by this 
Constitutional Court. This Court is, therefore, at all times 
equipped with the jurisdiction to probe into any public wrong 
affecting public at large, when the same has come before it 
through a petition. It does not matter if the said wrong has 
been specifically agitated or has coincidentally surfaced 
during the proceedings. This jurisdiction should not be 
confused with suo motu jurisdiction exercised by the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan under Article 184 of the 
Constitution, as in the present case jurisdiction of this court 
has been invoked through a petition placed before the Court 
by an aggrieved party. I, therefore, proceed further to assess if 
the Joint Venture Agreement entered into between PUNJMIN 
and ERPL passes the test of law and transparency.”

…Normally a person is considered as aggrieved 
person whose vital interest is likely to be effected by 
any discriminative perverse order/action of the 
executive authority and he may, in absence of any other 
swift remedy, approach this Court under Article 199 of 
the Constitution for redressal of the grievance of the 
citizen in rem. Any citizen being part of society have 
interest in public assets/ property which is being

touchstone 
of

constitutionality/legality of said order of the executive, 
as such, the petitioner who is a citizen of Pakistan is 
considered as an aggrieved person and he may assail 
the adverse order of the authority. Even otherwise once 
sufficient tangible, affirmative information or record is 
brought before the constitutional Courts who are 
mighty guardians of fundamental rights of the citizens 
as well as that of the public assets are placed under

Learned counsel argued that the perusal of the above 
judgements reflects that the concept of the ‘aggrieved person’ and ‘locus 
standi’ in matters related to sale, lease and disposal of public land are to be 
given an expansive and purposive meaning especially when violations of 
law have occurred in the impugned transactions. The contention of the 
Respondents that the Petitioner being a juristic person and not a natural 
person is estopped from invoking the constitutional jurisdiction of this 
Court is absolutely untenable since the stance, if agreed to, would mean 
that no organization or association of persons will ever be able to invoke 
the extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction of this Court for enforcement 
of Chapter 1, Part II of the Constitution which would in effect make host 
of judgments pronounced by the High Courts over time as per incuriam. 
The opposing argument essentially entails that despite flagrant violations 
of the rights of people, such as, their right to life, property and treatment in 
a non-discriminatory manner, at the hands of the State, the Court would be

limbless if the same excesses are being highlighted by a consortium rather 
than an individual person. Hence, such an argument has no place in the 
constitutional scheme of Pakistan and is diametrically opposed to 
established principles of natural justice. 
28. 
 
Elaborating on the scope of Judicial Review in the instant 
matter, it was contended that powers of Judicial Review available with this 
Court on the matters enumerated herein must not be exercised on the 
standard of Statutes. This is so because the Notification emanates from an 
executive action and therefore, is liable to be judged on the same 
benchmark as any other executive action, because the same has not gone 
through the rigorous accountability of the elected representatives of the 
people. This Court must apply the principles applicable to Judicial Review 
of executive actions in relation to the lease of public property as gleaned 
from the cited Judgments, inter alia, that public property is to be dealt with 
in a fair, just, transparent and reasonable manner, untainted by mala fide 
and without discrimination; that public property cannot be dealt with in a 
manner that allows for governmental representatives to make decisions 
regarding the same behind closed doors and with specific entities, 
defeating the concept of fair competition; and that infractions, if found, in 
the process of disposal (including lease) of public property cannot be 
condoned on any account, including, but not limited to, the claim that the 
same have resulted in public benefit, therefore, the idea of a ‘beneficial’ 
deviation from core fiduciary duties of undivided loyalty, prudence and 
reasonableness, which the State functionaries owe to the people of 
Pakistan must be rejected in the strongest terms. Thus, once the Court 
assesses that breach of trust and violation of law by a public institution 
have taken place, the Court must immediately proceed further to rectify 
such breach leaving behind the identity or antecedents of the Petitioner. 
Accordingly, it was urged that objections qua maintainability be discarded.  
29. 
 
On merits, it was contended that the Elections Act, 2017 (the 
“Elections Act”) codified the prevalent judicial pronouncements on the

scope and extent of powers of a caretaker government. In order to fully 
grasp the provision of the Elections Act, it is necessary to peruse the said 
Judgments to identify the spirit and intent of the legislation which is that 
any caretaker government is severely limited in the performance of its 
functions and cannot exercise powers like a democratically elected 
government since its sole mandate is to assist the Election Commission of 
Pakistan in ensuring the conduct of free, fair and honest elections. 
Reference in this regard was made to some relevant excerpts from the 
Judgments rendered in this context. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
Khawaja Muhammad Asif5 case has observed as under.  
“13. Essentially, according to the settled and accepted norms/ 
practice, the Caretaker Government (Prime Minister and 
Cabinet) is required to perform its functions to attend to the 
day-to-day matters, which are necessary to run the affairs of 
the State and also to watch the national interests, etc., in any 
eventuality in absence of an elected Government, and such 
Government is not authorized to make decisions/appointments 
having effect on the working/policies of the future 
Government, which is likely to take over after the elections. 
Apart from providing assistance to the Election Commission 
in organizing free, fair, honest and just elections in the 
country, it is not vested with the authority to take decisions 
concerning the affairs of the Government, which are bound to 
pre-empt the scope and sphere of activity, powers and 
jurisdiction of an elected Government. A Caretaker 
Government 
possesses 
limited 
powers 
and 
authority 
particularly in view of the fact that when it is appointed, there 
is no National Assembly in place and thus the all important 
aspect of accountability is absent. Further, the exercise of 
complete powers by the Caretaker Government goes against 
the doctrine of separation of powers which is the lifeline of 
any vibrant democracy. As noted earlier, the absence of 
legislature results in lack of checks and balances. The 
Caretaker Government also lacks the mandate of the majority 
of people, which is to be acquired by elected government 
through the general elections. Therefore, if a Caretaker 
Government is allowed to exercise complete powers available 
to an elected Government, it may make an attempt to continue 
to remain in office for a longer period of time or may take

such decisions which may cause problems for the future 
elected government.” 
 
30. 
 
A cursory view of the above reflects that the Supreme Court 
has restricted the role of a caretaker government to routine, day to day 
matters and not much beyond that. In fact, in Abdul Rauf6 case, the Apex 
Court held that even if a process was initiated by an elected government, 
the caretaker government cannot finalize the same, if material steps to do 
so are to be taken by the caretaker government. 
“7. There is no denial of the fact that the process of 
recruitment may have been initiated by way of publication of 
advertisement before the Caretaker Government was put in 
place. However, all material steps including processing of 
applications, tests (if any) interviews (if any) and 
recommendations by the Recruitment Committee were taken 
during the Caretaker Government and the elected Government 
was practically presented with a fait accompli. The mandate 
of a Caretaker Government is to hold the mantle in the 
interregnum when the term of the sitting Government has 
expired and the new Government is yet to take charge. A 
caretaker Government is empowered only to carry out day to 
day affairs of the State with the help of available 
machinery/resources/ manpower. It cannot take policy 
decisions and permanent measures including recruitments, 
making appointments, transfers and postings of Government 
Servants. It must leave such matters to the elected 
Government which takes charge as a result of elections. It was 
in this context that in a case reported as Khawaja Muhammad 
Asif v. Federation of Pakistan and others (supra) held that a 
Caretaker Government/Cabinet has to confine itself to 
running day to day administration of the State and to take 
decisions required for orderly running the affairs of the State. 
However, decisions having far reaching consequences should 
only be taken by the elected government having the mandate 
to perform such functions as are required of it in exercise of 
powers conferred by the Constitution….” 
  
31. 
 
The above Judgments received subsequent statutory cover 
under the Elections Act, Section 230 whereof is to be read in the light of 
the afore-noted Judgments. As such, it can be safely ascertained that the

powers of a caretaker government are restricted to provide assistance to the 
Election Commission in organizing free, fair and just elections, to perform 
functions only to the extent that is necessary for running day to day affairs 
of the government and the functions so performed must be routine, non-
controversial and urgent in nature. A caretaker government must restrict 
itself from taking an action or measure of permanent and irreversible 
nature, thereby, preempting the powers and jurisdiction of the future 
elected government. 
32. 
 
Various aspects of the impugned transaction show that all the 
actions are neither routine, urgent or even non-controversial nor do they 
relate to day to day affairs, necessary for running the functions of the 
government and are instead of a permanent and irreversible nature, insofar 
as the powers of not just the next elected government, but at least of the 
next four (4) elected governments (since the lease is for 20 years 
extendable by another 10 years) were impaired. In light of the above, any 
transaction relating to public policy which violates the above principles of 
transparency, fairness, justice and reasonableness would be violative of the 
fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan, including but not limited to, 
their right to life, property, equality and a non-discriminatory treatment, as 
guaranteed to them under the Constitution and any decision thereon by a 
caretaker government would run contrary to the fundamentals of 
democracy enshrined in our Constitution.

While elaborating scope of the new SOCs, it was stated that 
the new SOCs generally create terms and conditions on which State land is 
to be granted to public and private entities for the purpose of ‘agriculture 
research 
and 
farming’, 
‘import 
substitution’, 
‘food 
security’, 
‘standardization and maximization of seed productivity’, ‘livestock 
research’, ‘breeding and farming’ and for any other purpose relating to the 
agricultural or livestock sectors. The new SOCs allow for grant of State 
land on lease through open auction and through single source, provide a 
procedure of determining rent to be paid and specify a lease period of 20

W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
years, extendable up to a maximum of 30 years. Section 10(2) of the 
Colonization Act stipulates that the GOP (which means the elected 
government) may issue SOCs on which it is willing to grant land to 
tenants. Thus, in the light of Mustafa Impex7 case, the GOP is to be 
unequivocally understood as the whole Elected Cabinet, including the 
Chief Minister. Hence, it is clear that the impugned transaction has not 
been approved by the GOP as the same was beyond the mandate and scope 
of the Caretaker Government. 
34. 
 
The new SOCs were approved by the Caretaker Cabinet 
which was not empowered to approve and notify any such instrument, 
given the scope and magnitude of the provisions contained therein since 
formulating a policy or entering into arrangements regarding ‘agriculture 
research 
and 
farming’, 
‘import 
substitution’, 
‘food 
security’, 
‘standardization and maximization of seed productivity’, ‘livestock 
research’, ‘breeding and farming’, and for any other purpose relating to the 
agricultural or livestock sectors does not fall under the ‘day to day’ affairs. 
The new SOCs deal with a subject which is not ‘routine’ since admittedly 
this is the first instance that such new SOCs are being issued on single 
source basis. The new SOCs create a situation where any lease granted 
thereunder cannot be reversed by the future elected government. The new 
SOCs deals with an important, but not urgent, matter of public importance 
since the facts hereinabove reflect that the previous Elected Government 
was proceeding with caution in the matter by ensuring to take input from 
all concerned stakeholders and for this purpose was willing to let the 
original SOCs remain pending for over two years. The new SOCs make a 
policy that preempts the exercise of authority by the future elected 
government. The secrecy and undue haste through which the new SOCs 
were adopted in breach of explicit constitutional and legal mandate depict 
that the same are also controversial especially when they deprive at least

four future elected governments from exercising any authority with 
reference to leases granted thereunder in a non-reversible manner. 
Therefore, it is established in unambiguous terms that the new SOCs could 
not have been issued by the incumbent Caretaker Cabinet. 
35. 
 
Without prejudice to the fact that in view of the Abdul Rauf 
case (supra), a process initiated by the elected government cannot be 
completed by the caretaker government, if it requires substantive steps 
(such as reviewing changes to the same), even otherwise, there was no 
unqualified and unconditional approval of the new SOCs notified by the 
Elected Government vide the Notification. This is on account of the fact 
that the approval ‘in principle’ given by the Elected Cabinet dated 
28.02.2022 was conditional in nature and was subject to its placement 
before the specifically constituted Ministerial Committee. The perusal of 
the above decision reflects that the Elected Cabinet had referred the matter 
to the Ministerial Committee comprising both, elected representatives as 
well as members of the civil bureaucracy. The said Ministerial Committee 
was to review the original SOCs placed before the Elected Cabinet in its 
51st meeting held on 28.02.2022 and give its comments thereon. Any 
comments, changes or suggestions regarding the original SOCs by the 
Ministerial Committee would have required approval from the Elected 
Cabinet. 
36. 
 
Therefore, in light of the Mustafa Impex case (supra) any 
changes in the original SOCs by the Ministerial Committee required an 
approval from the Elected Cabinet before issuance of the Notification by 
the GOP under Section 10(2) of the Colonization Act which is admittedly 
absent which fact alone is sufficient to declare the impugned Notification 
as unlawful.    
37. 
 
Without prejudice to the above, and even otherwise, the new 
SOCs approved by the Caretaker Cabinet are materially different from the 
original SOCs conditionally approved ‘in principle’ by the Elected 
Cabinet. Further, the new SOCs as approved by the Caretaker Cabinet are

also different from the new SOCs notified by the BOR. A comparison of 
the material differences which directly go to the heart of the principles of 
transparency, fairness and non-discrimination between the original SOCs 
placed before the Elected Cabinet in its 51st meeting and the new SOCs as 
presented before the Caretaker Cabinet (having never been seen by the 
Elected Cabinet) were highlighted as follows:-

The Elected Cabinet only 
considered the SOCs to 
the

However, the Caretaker 
Cabinet have materially 
expanded the scope to 
include 
the

sector as well.

governmental 
(federal,

foreign) 
entities and State 
Owned 
Enterprises. 
The only form 
of 
lease 
recognized was 
a lease through 
open 
auction 
and to private 
entities. 
This perhaps is the most 
material change to the 
original SOCs vis-à-vis 
the 
new 
SOCs 
and 
completely changes the 
scope, nature, and process 
of leases under the new 
SOCs. 
This 
also 
introduces 
conditions 
which 
are 
non-
transparent, 
discriminatory 
towards 
private 
entities, 
and 
which deny the right to 
information of the public 
regarding public property 
since decisions (as have 
been made in the instant 
matter) regarding disposal 
of public property can 
now be taken without any 
public 
participation, 
disclosure 
and 
knowledge. 
Envisages rent for

Only envisages 
rental 
income 
to be earned by 
the GOP with 
no 
expense, 
investment 
or 
equity of 
its 
own. 
This too is a material 
change since it changes 
the potential of the GOP 
to generate revenue from 
the use of public land by 
other 
entities. 
By 
allowing 
for 
a 
profit 
sharing 
model, 
this 
actually creates room for 
loss being suffered by 
grant of leases of State 
land to other government 
entities which can in no 
manner 
be 
deemed 
prudent. 
 
No 
size 
of 
a 
tenancy 
was 
provided. 
Tenancies were 
to be for five 
hundred 
acres 
or above. 
This is a material change 
since the original SOCs 
had some indication of 
the size of tenancies to be

granted. On the other 
hand, the new SOCs 
presented to the Caretaker 
Cabinet 
contained 
no 
ceiling, meaning thereby, 
that an inordinate amount 
of land may be provided 
thereunder. 
This 
is 
precisely why a JVA for 
up to one million acres of 
land has been envisaged. 
 
  
38. 
 
Furthermore, there were two key material differences inter se 
the new SOCs approved by the Caretaker Cabinet and later notified by the 
BOR, which are as under:-

partnership was 
required for a

The 
change 
was 
admittedly made by the 
Caretaker 
Cabinet, 
clearly discounting the 
claim that the new 
SOCs as notified were 
approved 
by 
the 
Elected Cabinet.

The 
change 
was 
admittedly made by the 
Caretaker 
Cabinet, 
clearly discounting the 
claim that the new 
SOCs as notified were 
approved 
by 
the 
Elected Cabinet and 
reducing the minimum 
revenue to be earned 
therefrom. 
  
39. 
 
Accordingly, it was stressed that a perusal of the above tables 
reflects that there were material changes in the original SOCs as seen by

the Elected Cabinet, as presented before the Caretaker Cabinet and as 
approved by the Caretaker Cabinet without following any documented 
process. Consequently, the Caretaker Cabinet has clearly ventured beyond 
its constitutional and statutory powers and therefore, the Notification and 
any other arrangements resulting from it are liable to be struck down on 
this score alone. Not only was the Caretaker Cabinet barred from 
completing a process left incomplete by the Elected Cabinet, they were, 
even otherwise, not competent to make material changes irreversible by 
the future elected government. 
40. 
 
Touching upon the mystery relating to the Ministerial 
Committee’s meeting, learned counsel recalled that during the course of 
proceedings vide order dated 09.05.2023, this Court inter alia, posed the 
following query to bridge the gap between the conditional approval of the 
original SOCs and the new SOCs:- 
“The proceedings of Ministerial Committee as per decision of 
the Provincial Cabinet on Agenda No. 19 regarding the 
original SOCs taken in its 51st meeting dated 28.02.2022.”  
 
However, vide additional reply, the concerned Respondents submitted the 
following in response to the above query:- 
“After principle approval of the Provincial Cabinet on 
28.02.2022, a Note for Minister for Law was initiated for 
obtaining schedule of the meeting of the Ministerial 
Committee (Annex A). A Notice for the meeting dated 
14.10.2022, was issued on 13.10.2022 (Annex B). A copy of 
attendance sheet is placed at Annex C. The draft statement of 
conditions was discussed in the meeting and Senior Member 
Board of Revenue was directed to put up the amended 
Statements of Conditions (SOCs) before the Provincial 
Cabinet, however, formal minutes were not issued. This    
very fact was mentioned in a Summary for the Cabinet  
(Annex D).” 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
  
41. 
 
In this context, it was submitted that the said response reflects 
that no minutes of the Ministerial Committee’s meeting, if any held, were 
recorded. Without prejudice to the fact that this is an egregious violation of 

51 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 20906 / 2023 
W. P. No. 20457 / 2023 
W. P. No. 27115 / 2023 
W. P. No. 28283 / 2023 
W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
Rules 22, 28 & 29 of the Rules, 2011, the attendance sheet appended with 
the Additional Reply which ostensibly reflects that the meeting of the 
Ministerial Committee was indeed held does not reflect a meeting of the 
Ministerial Committee formed by the Elected Cabinet vide its decision 
dated 28.02.2022 on Agenda Item No. 19. This is so because only one 
member out of the four Ministers identified by the Elected Cabinet in its 
decision dated 28.02.2022 attended the meeting. Therefore, even if it is 
assumed that the attendance sheet is authentic, it does not reflect that a 
meeting of the Ministerial Committee, as envisaged by the Elected 
Cabinet, had been held. 
42. 
 
The counter stance of the Respondents placing reliance on 
Rules 28(8), 28(9) and 28(14) of the Rules, 2011, stating that the 
attendance by the Secretaries of the concerned Departments may be treated 
as substitute of the absentee Ministers is untenable because this matter was 
not so urgent for the Secretaries to not wait for the return of their 
respective Ministers since the matter had already remained pending for 
several months. The meeting, if at all, clearly took place in an 
unreasonable haste, since a matter that had remained pending for over two 
years, suddenly required that a meeting thereof be held on one day notice 
(the notice of the meeting was issued on 13.10.2022, whereas, the meeting 
was ostensibly held on 14.10.2022), violating the prescribed procedure 
under the Rules, 2011. Secondly, in any event, the Secretaries were 
obligated to submit the matter and the relevant records under Rule 28(14) 
of the Rules, 2011 before the concerned Minister once the Minister 
became available. That is, the final approval of the items discussed in the 
meeting remained subject to the approval by the concerned Ministers, 
regardless of their absence from the meeting. However, there is nothing on 
record to reflect that such mandatory provisions were followed. In fact, 
admittedly no minutes were issued for the meeting and so, the question of 
the Minister approving the matters discussed in the meeting does not even 
arise. Consequently, the reliance by the Respondents on the 

52 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 20906 / 2023 
W. P. No. 20457 / 2023 
W. P. No. 27115 / 2023 
W. P. No. 28283 / 2023 
W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
aforementioned Rules to substitute the attendance of the missing Ministers 
is misplaced at best and a disingenuous attempt to mislead this Court, at 
worst. This submission is made notwithstanding the fact that the Elected 
Cabinet had specifically nominated both the Ministers and Secretaries of 
the concerned Departments, separately. The Ministers, in this scenario, 
would be deemed to personally constitute as members of the Ministerial 
Committee and could not have been replaced in their stead. 
43. 
 
There is nothing on record to establish that any changes to the 
original SOCs reflected in paragraph 3.3 of the minutes of the 4th meeting 
of the Caretaker Cabinet held on 09.02.2023, were introduced in the tenure 
of the Elected Cabinet. Rather, the same appear to have been introduced by 
the concerned Departments of their own accord. Therefore, the changes to 
the original SOCs being material in nature are unlawful and liable to be 
struck down, for lacking the necessary approval from the previous Elected 
Cabinet. 
44. 
 
Hence, there is no doubt about the fact that the new SOCs that 
provided the ground for the JVA were rooted in the action of the Caretaker 
Government, rather than the Elected Government which contradicts the 
very premise of the Respondents that the JVA is in furtherance of an 
exercise taken by the Elected Government. Even otherwise, it appears that 
the Caretaker Government materially changed the original SOCs precisely 
to accommodate the request made by the DGSP vide letter dated 
08.02.2023, i.e. one day before the new SOCs were approved by the 
Caretaker Cabinet. As the Caretaker Government had no authority to make 
a material amendment of this sort to the original SOCs, the JVA must be 
declared unlawful and void ab initio. 
45. 
 
It was next contented that approval and issuance of the 
Notification of the new SOCs by the Governor of Punjab was unlawful. 
Section 10(2) of the Colonization Act provides that the Provincial 
Government may issue SOCs on which it is willing to grant land in a 
colony to tenants. The Notification, on the other hand, has been issued by 

53 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 20906 / 2023 
W. P. No. 20457 / 2023 
W. P. No. 27115 / 2023 
W. P. No. 28283 / 2023 
W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
the Governor of Punjab, as is evident from the recital thereto. The power to 
issue SOCs vests exclusively with the GOP. However, the Notification is 
stated to have been issued by the Governor of the Punjab and is, therefore, 
not in accordance with the mandate of the Colonization Act. The 
constitutional Courts of Pakistan have repeatedly held that when a law 
requires a thing to be done in a particular manner, it should be done in that 
manner, or not done at all. It is only the GOP which, needless to say means 
the Cabinet as held in Mustafa Impex case (supra) could have issued the 
Notification for the new SOCs under Section 10 of the Colonization Act. 
Therefore, the new SOCs purported to have been issued by the Governor 
of the Punjab are illegal and ultra vires the Colonization Act, hence, are 
liable to be declared as illegal and unconstitutional forthwith. 
46. 
 
Questioning the validity of the JVA, it was contended that the 
JVA has been executed between the Governor of the Punjab and the 
Pakistan Army as a consequence of the newly added provision for ‘single 
source lease’ in the new SOCs. This is a unique document, inasmuch as it 
contains no reference to any rent or the other processes required to be 
followed under the Colonization Act and the new SOCs. The JVA is, 
therefore, also illegal, void-ab-initio and liable to be struck down. 
47. 
 
Highlighting the grounds of attack to the JVA, learned 
counsel contented that firstly, as with the issuance of the new SOCs 
themselves (even if it is assumed, without conceding, that the same have 
been validly issued), the JVA itself deprives at least four future elected 
governments from exercising rights upon any lands granted thereunder 
since there is no provision for a ‘no-cause’ termination contained therein, 
and the same can only be terminated if the lessee, i.e. the Pakistan Army, 
contravenes the provisions of the new SOCs. The claim of the 
Respondents that the transaction being between two governments would 
always mean that it is reversible, is untenable as the Pakistan Army (or the 
Federal Government, as the case should be, and the President, in whose 
name the JVA could have been) is not an attached or associated entity of 

54

W. P. No. 20457 / 2023 
W. P. No. 27115 / 2023 
W. P. No. 28283 / 2023 
W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
the GOP. The latter has no influence on the same and cannot assume that 
any request for resumption of land without meeting the conditions of 
resumption laid out under the new SOCs and the JVA will be honoured. 
This is even otherwise without prejudice to the fact that the new SOCs 
only provide for a cancellation of lease if the lessee violates the same itself 
or any provincial or federal law and even Clause 8 of the JVA only allows 
for resumption in certain circumstances and does not give any power to the 
future elected government to cancel the lease simpliciter. This under no 
stretch of the imagination can be termed as reversible. 
48. 
 
Moreover, the provisions of the JVA contradict the provisions 
of the Colonization Act and the new SOCs themselves. Section 10(3) of 
the Colonization Act stipulates that consequent to issuance of SOCs, the 
Collector may, subject to the control of the BOR, allot land to any person, 
to be held subject to such SOCs issued by the GOP, as the Collector may 
by written order declare to be applicable to the case. No written order has 
been placed before the Court, wherein, the Collector may have identified 
any land that is to be leased out under the terms of the new SOCs. Despite 
this, hundreds of undetermined and unspecified Acres of land is being 
leased out to the Pakistan Army under the JVA.  
49. 
 
The above is without prejudice to the fact that nothing has 
been placed on record to reflect that some consultative or decision-making 
process was followed either by the FOP under whom the Pakistan Army 
operates or by the Pakistan Army itself. Furthermore, the process for single 
source lease as provided under the new SOCs has not been followed which 
requires that details of State land be specified along with draft JVA and 
Board of Management. But the JVA only says that this is for ‘up to one 
million Acres’ of land, without identifying exactly where such land is. The 
role of the Collector has also been removed in contravention of the parent 
Statute which requires the Collector to specify land. However, here, a 
‘Negotiation Committee’ has been set up in order to release or reclaim 
land. This is in further contradiction to the new SOCs which do not

W. P. No. 28283 / 2023 
W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
provide for resumption simpliciter without their being a violation by the 
lessee as a lease has to be for 20 years and further extendable by 10 years. 
Furthermore, the JVA includes provisions, such as, ‘afforestation’, which 
is wholly outside the purview of the Colonization Act which specifies that 
SOCs can be for agriculture and livestock, as recognized by the new SOCs 
themselves as well. The grant of Forest Land regarding Rakh Goharwala 
thereunder is even more worrying since the same is a protected forest and 
cannot be leased out for any purpose. 
50. 
 
It was pointed out that there appears to have been significant 
changes in the role and input of the GOP in the whole process. The matter, 
as originally presented to the Caretaker Cabinet (it is pertinent to reiterate 
that the Elected Cabinet never even dreamt of such an arrangement) 
reflected in paragraph 3.5 of the minutes of its 7th meeting dated 
25.02.2023 that ‘initial funding’ shall be provided by the Pakistan Army. 
The replies filed by both the GOP and the FOP repeatedly refer to the fact 
that the GOP is only contributing its land. However, the letter dated 
08.02.2023 sent by the DGSP to the SMBR stated that the Pakistan Army 
can provide ‘free tubewells’ and ‘farm-to-market’ roads. Yet, when the 
matter was deliberated by the Caretaker Cabinet in its 7th meeting, in 
paragraph 3.8 (which was subsequently approved), it was determined that 
investment would “preferably” be provided by the Pakistan Army. 
Interestingly, there was no deliberation or statement with respect to 
tubewells, electricity provision and farm-to-market roads at all in the 
matter as presented to the Caretaker Cabinet in its 7th meeting. Yet, the 
JVA in Clause 3 obligates the GOP to provide canal water, tubewells and 
construct farm-to-market roads, whereas, the lessee, i.e. the Pakistan 
Army, would only pay for utility charges. The JVA, therefore, is clearly 
beyond anything that was ever considered by the Elected or Caretaker 
Cabinet.   
51. 
 
Furthermore, according to Articles 129 and 139 of the 
Constitution, the executive authority of the Provincial Government shall be

exercised in the name of the Governor. The Respondents have placed a 
reliance on the said Articles to substantiate their position that the 
Notification was validly issued by the Governor of Punjab. However, it is 
to be noted here that Federal Government can also exercise its executive 
powers only in the name of the President and no one else. In the instant 
scenario, however, while the GOP has entered the JVA in the name of the 
Governor, the Pakistan Army has done so through the DGSP instead of the 
President. As elaborated earlier, there is no law allowing for such a 
deviation from a substantial procedural requirement of this nature, thereby, 
raising a question mark over the validity of the JVA on this point alone. 
52. 
 
The above, in any event, is being submitted without prejudice 
to the fact that, under the Constitution and all applicable laws, including 
the Rules of Business, 1973 of the Federal Government, (the “Rules, 
1973”) and the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 (the “Army Act”), the Armed 
Forces of Pakistan or any Department, Division, entity or Directorate 
thereof, has no competence to directly enter into any arrangement with any 
entity or perform any functions without the express approval of the Federal 
Government (i.e. the Federal Cabinet) and that too only to the extent that 
the same relates to the defence of Pakistan from external aggression and 
while acting in aid of civil powers under any law. 
53. 
 
The JVA was entered into between the GOP, through the 
Governor and the Pakistan Army, through the DGSP consequent to the 
notified SOCs, paving way for the ultimate leasing of up to one million 
Acres of land to latter. The fundamental requirements of the formation of a 
lawful contract in terms of the capacity of the contracting parties to enter 
into such an arrangement was in violation of the relevant constitutional 
Articles, relevant Rules of the Rules, 1973, the Rules, 2011 and the 
Judgments of the Supreme Court of Pakistan which demonstrate that the 
DGSP, meaning thereby, the Pakistan Army lacked the capacity to enter 
into the JVA with the GOP.

54. 
 
Commenting on the scope of Article 245 of the Constitution, 
it was stressed that it clearly lays down the limits to the functions and 
powers of the Armed Forces of Pakistan. Its two main functions are to 
defend Pakistan against external aggression and to act in aid of civil 
power, subject to law, and when called upon to do so. With regard to the 
latter, it must be emphasized here that any action in aid of civil power 
could be performed by the Armed Forces of Pakistan only when there is a 
law allowing for the same and when a specific request to this effect is 
made by the Federal Government. Assuming that the Respondents argue 
that undertaking the project of CAF falls within the scope of acting in aid 
of civil powers, even then there is nothing on record that such assistance 
was requested, or approved, in accordance with the Constitution and law. 
55. 
 
In the instant scenario, there is nothing on record to show that 
a request to indulge the DGSP in any commercial venture was made by the 
GOP, meaning thereby that the Pakistan Army entered into the JVA of its 
own accord, without any approval by the Federal Government either. The 
scenario is worsened by the fact that the DGSP is not even one of the 
attached Departments of the Federal Government as laid down in Schedule 
III of the Rules, 1973. Furthermore, the Respondents have provided no 
documents of any sort to explain the process through which the DGSP was 
created and the rules that govern it. In essence, an agreement allowing for 
the lease of around 2% of the total territory of Punjab has been entered into 
by an entity which is surrounded by a total vacuum with regard to the 
details regarding the process of its formation, governing laws and 
procedures as well as any records substantiating its lawful capacity to enter 
the JVA. 
56. 
 
The only Statute that relates to the conduct and procedures of 
the Pakistan Army is the Army Act, wherein, no provision is available 
which authorizes or empowers the Pakistan Army to undertake any activity 
beyond its composition for the purposes of welfare without the express 
permission granted by the Federal Government to do so. The Statute is

W. P. No. 28283 / 2023 
W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
completely silent on the scope of functions and powers of the Pakistan 
Army and deals with subjects, such as, appointments, transfers, 
termination of the personnel of the Pakistan Army as well as the actions 
deemed as officers under the Army’s code of conduct and so on. However, 
it speaks nothing about the query at hand, as to whether the Pakistan Army 
has the capacity to enter into a contract, such as, the JVA, of its own 
accord and without the express involvement and approval of the Federal 
Government. 
 
57. 
 
The fact that the approval of the Federal Government is 
necessary, and that too only if a law specifically allows as such, has been 
determined by the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Islamabad High 
Court in multiple Judgments, which are of great significance in 
determining the parameters of the powers and the scope of the functions of 
the Armed Forces. In the Sindh High Court Bar Association8 case, the 
Supreme Court remarked as under:-  
 
“53. On a plain reading of the provisions of Article 245(1), 
the functions of the Armed Forces can be bifurcated into two 
categories, namely, they shall (1) defend Pakistan against 
external aggression or threat of war, and (2) subject to law, 
act in aid of civil power when called upon to do so. Under 
clause (1) of Article 243, the control and command of the 
Armed Forces is vested in the Federal Government, therefore, 
in the performance of both the categories of functions, the 
Armed Forces act under the directions of the Federal 
Government. Thus, the provisions of clause (1A) of Article 
243 under which the supreme command of the Armed Forces 
vests in the President, does not, in any manner, derogate from 
the power of the Federal Government to require the Armed 
Forces to defend Pakistan against external aggression or threat 
of war, or to act in aid of civil power in accordance with law.”

The Supreme Court elaborating the role of Armed Forces in 
Air Marshal (Retd.) Muhammad Asghar Khan9 case held as follows:-  
“83. The role and functions of Armed Forces have been 
discussed in detail in Sindh High Court Bar Association’s 
case (supra) wherein it has been observed that on a plain 
reading of the provisions of Article 245(1), the functions of 
the Armed Forces can be bifurcated into two categories, 
namely; they shall defend Pakistan against external 
aggression or threat of war; and subject to law, act in aid of 
civil power when called upon to do so. Under clause (1) of 
Article 243, the control and command of the Armed Forces is 
vested in the Federal Government, therefore, in the 
performance of both the categories of functions, the Armed 
Forces act under the directions of the Federal Government. 
Thus, the provisions of clause (1A) of Article 243 under 
which the supreme command of the Armed Forces vests in the 
President, does not, in any manner, derogate from the power 
of the Federal Government to require the Armed Forces to 
defend Pakistan against external aggression or threat of war, 
or to act in aid of civil power in accordance with law. The 
Constitution does not envisage any situation where the Armed 
Forces may act without any direction by the Federal 
Government. Clause (3) ibid, provides that the President shall, 
in consultation with the Prime Minister appoint the Chairman, 
Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee; the Chief of the Army Staff; 
the Chief of the Naval Staff; and the Chief of the Air Staff. 
Under Article 244, every member of the Armed Forces makes 
oath, inter alia, to the effect that he will bear true faith and 
allegiance to Pakistan and uphold the Constitution of 
Pakistan, and that he will not engage himself in any political 
activities whatsoever. Any action of the Armed Forces 
undertaken without a direction by the Federal Government 
shall be unconstitutional, illegal, void ab initio and 
consequently of no legal effect. Thus, it was held that any 
member of the Armed Forces, including the Chairman, Joint 
Chiefs of Staff Committee and the three Service Chiefs, 
namely, the Chief of Army Staff, the Chief of Naval Staff and 
the Air Chief, or any person acting under their authority, or on 
their behalf, who acts in the performance of either of his 
functions of defending Pakistan against external aggression, 
or of acting, subject to law, in aid of civil power without any 
direction by the Federal Government acts in violation of the

While adverting to the commercial use of land by the Pakistan 
Army in Islamabad, the Islamabad High Court in Prof. Zahid Baig Mirza10 
case specifically discussed the status and claim of the RVF Directorate and 
its competence to own land and to execute commercial leases. The 
following extracts therefrom are of significance:-  
“20. The RVF Directorate is an internal office of the General 
Headquarters (GHQ) of the Pakistan Army, one of the 
branches of the Armed Forces. The GHQ is under the 
administrative 
control 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Defence, 
Government of Pakistan. The RVF Directorate nor the GHQ 
have the legal status under the Constitution or the law to own 
State owned land. As will be discussed later, land is allocated 
for the use of the branches of the Armed Forces and it is 
managed and retained in accordance with the scheme of the 
governing law and, that too, by the entities and public 
functionaries designated there under. 
 
….In an earlier judgment this Court has elaborately described 
the status of the Armed Forces and its locus standi to own and 
manage State land and the same is reiterated as follows. 
 
The mandate of the Armed Forces of Pakistan has been 
described in Chapter 2 of Part XII of the Constitution. The 
three main branches of the Armed Forces are the Pakistan 
Army, Pakistan Navy and Pakistan Air Force. Article 243 of 
the Constitution provides that the Federal Government shall 
have control and command of the Armed Forces. The 
supreme command of the Armed Forces vests in the President 
of Pakistan. The latter, subject to law, has the power to raise 
and maintain the three branches of the Armed Forces. Article 
244 makes it a constitutional requirement for every member 
of the Armed Forces to take an oath in the form set out in the 
Third Schedule, which includes a solemn pledge and 
commitment to uphold the Constitution and to serve as 
required by and under the law. Sub Article (1) of Article 245 
explicitly provides that the Armed Forces shall, under the 
directions of the Federal Government, defend Pakistan against 
external aggression or threat of war and, subject to law, act in 
aid of the civil power when called upon to do so. The Rules of

Defence Division. It is noted that the administration of 
Military Lands and Cantonments Group is also under its 
administrative control. The august Supreme Court, in the case 
titled “Justice Hassnat Ahmed Khan and others v. Federation 
of Pakistan/State“ [PLD 2011 SC 680] has held that under 
Article 245(1) of the Constitution, the Armed Forces of 
Pakistan are bound to remain under the direction of the 
Federal Government to defend Pakistan against external 
aggression or threat of war and, subject to law, act in aid of 
the civil power when called upon to do so. It has been further 
held that non-adherence to the constitutional provisions, 
prima-facie, tends to establish denying the oath to uphold the 
Constitution. It has been further held that deviation from the 
constitutional mandate by members of the Armed Forces 
cannot be condoned by the superior courts. In the case titled 
“Sindh High Court Bar Association v. Federation of Pakistan” 
[PLD 2009 SC 879] the apex Court has elaborated the scheme 
of the constitution and has observed that, on a plain reading of 
Article 245(1), the functions of the Armed Forces can be 
bifurcated into two categories, i.e. to defend Pakistan against 
external aggression or threat of war and, subject to law, act in 
aid of civil power when called upon to do so. Moreover, it has 
been observed that under clause (1) of Article 243, the control 
and command of the Armed Forces is vested in the Federal 
Government, therefore, in the performance of both the 
categories of the aforementioned functions, the Armed Forces 
act under the directions of the Federal Government. Reliance 
is placed on the cases titled “Air Marshal (Retd.) Muhammad 
Asghar Khan v. General (Retd.) Mirza Aslam Baig, former 
Chief of Army Staff and others” [PLD 2013 SC 1], “Sh. 
Liaquat Hussain and others v. Federation of Pakistan through 
Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, 
Islamabad and others” [PLD 1999 SC 504], Page - 21 W.P. 
No. 1772 of 2020. “District Bar Association, Rawalpindi and 
others v. Federation of Pakistan and others” [PLD 2015 SC 
401].  
 
The Pakistan Army Act, 1952 [hereinafter referred to as 
the “Act of 1952”], the Air Force Act 1953 [hereinafter

referred to as the “Act of 1953”] and the Pakistan Navy 
Ordinance, 1961 [hereinafter referred to as the “Ordinance of 
1961”] have been promulgated to regulate the respective 
branches of the Armed Forces and its discipline. The 
aforementioned statutes regulate the discipline and internal 
working of the respective branches of the Armed Forces but 
does not empower the officers to undertake any activity 
beyond the establishments. There is no provision under the 
afore mentioned laws which authorizes or empowers the 
Pakistan Army to undertake, directly or indirectly, activities 
beyond its composition for the purposes of welfare, unless the 
Federal Government has expressly granted permission to do 
so. As a corollary, the Pakistan Army has no power nor 
jurisdiction to, directly or indirectly, engage in business 
ventures of any nature outside its composition nor to claim the 
ownership of state land.  
 
… There could be multiple eventualities requiring the Armed 
Forces to act in aid of the civil power e.g. internal security, 
natural calamities such as floods, earthquakes etc. The 
secondary function to act in aid of the civil power is subject to 
law and can only be undertaken if 'called upon to do so'. In 
case of both the functions the Armed Forces cannot act on its 
own. These are the only two constitutional functions 
mandated to the Armed Forces. Since the command and 
control of the Armed Forces vests in the Federal Government, 
therefore, no branch can undertake any activity or perform 
functions outside their respective establishments unless 
expressly directed or called upon to do so. The unique 
responsibilities have been prescribed under the Constitution 
and, therefore, obedience to the provisions ibid and law is an 
inviolable obligation of every branch and member of the 
Armed Forces as provided under Article 5. The branches of 
the Armed Forces and their members take a constitutional 
oath in the name of Allah to uphold the Constitution and to 
honestly and faithfully serve Pakistan as required by and 
under the law. Violation of law by members of the Armed 
Forces is definitely a breach of their constitutional oath and a 
transgression from the prescribed functions. The Pakistan 
Army nor its officers are authorized or mandated to 
undertake, directly or indirectly, any activity such as leasing 
government land for commercial purpose.  
 
The next crucial question is whether the Pakistan Army 
or its officers are empowered to acquire, own or, in any other 
manner, deal with immovable property for commercial 
purposes. The scheme of the Constitution and the relevant

W. P. No. 28283 / 2023

laws regarding acquiring land for the use of the Armed Forces 
is unambiguous. Article 173 of the Constitution explicitly 
declares that the executive authority of the Federation shall 
extend, subject to any Act of the appropriate legislature, to the 
grant, sale, disposition or mortgage of any property vested in, 
and to the purchase or acquisition of property on behalf of the 
Federal Government or, as the case may be, the Provincial 
Government and to the making of contracts. Sub Article (2) of 
the Article 173 explicitly provides that all properties acquired 
for the purposes of the Federation or of a Provincial 
Government shall vest in the Federal Government. Sub 
Article (3) of Article 173 further provides that all contracts 
made in the exercise of the executive authority of the 
Federation or of a Province shall be expressed to be made in 
the name of the President or, as the case may be, the Governor 
of the Province. The Cantonment Act 1924 [hereinafter 
referred to as the “Act of 1924”], The Cantonment Lands and 
Administration Rules, 1937 [hereinafter referred to as the 
“Rules of 1937”] and the Rules for the Acquisition, Custody, 
Relinquishment etc., of Military Lands (A.C.R. Rules) 1944 
[hereinafter referred to as the “A.C.R. Rules”] govern the 
manner in which immovable property can be acquired for and 
put to use for the branches of the Armed Forces. As already 
noted, it is the mandate of the constitution that property 
acquired for the purposes of the Federation shall exclusively 
vest in the Federal Government. 
 
…..The urge of State institutions to act as a state within the 
state is obvious from the above discussed facts. The 
authorities entrusted with statutory powers to guard against 
violations seem to be helpless or complacent. The acts and 
stance of the RFV Directorate and the GHQ of the Pakistan 
Army have profound consequences for the rule of law. They 
acted on their own and while doing so they have seriously 
undermined the rule of law in derogation to their declared 
functions under the Constitution...”  
  
60. 
 
Similar conclusions were drawn in Mrs. Zeenat Salim11 case. 
Therefore, it is established beyond doubt that any organ of the Armed 
Forces cannot undertake any activity outside its composition without an 
express approval of the Federal Government and in any event, they may 
not be able to resume any land which does not fall under the category of

cantonment lands and deal with the same on commercial basis. The JVA is 
thus liable to be set aside on this score alone.  
61. 
 
The Respondents have placed reliance on Article 147 of the 
Constitution to make a case that the Province can entrust the Federal 
Government and its officers with regards to a matter that otherwise falls in 
the domain of the Province. The said Article is not attracted on several 
accords. Firstly, neither there is anything on record to show that any 
request was made by the GOP to the Federal Government with regard to 
asking for facilitation in entering an arrangement related to CAF, nor any 
record shows that consent to any such request was given by the Federal 
Government. Moreover, what further dents the stance of the Respondents 
is that, as is evident from the proviso of the said Article, it assumes the 
existence of a Provincial Assembly which shall then ratify such a request. 
However, in the present scenario of the Province being governed by a 
Caretaker Cabinet, the question of ratification by the Provincial Assembly 
does not even arise. 
62. 
 
The crux of the above discussion is that the Pakistan Army, 
acting through the DGSP, lacked the capacity to enter the JVA as firstly, it 
is restricted to do so due to the limitations placed on the scope of its 
powers and functions by the Constitution. Secondly, even if it is assumed 
(without conceding) that the Pakistan Army could undertake such a project, it 
could not have entered the contract of its own accord and an express 
request for indulging it by the GOP and an approval to the same by the 
Federal Government were the minimum requirements for the JVA to be a 
valid contract. However, as nothing on record proves compliance with any of 
the said procedural requirements, the JVA is liable to be held void ab initio. 
63. 
 
It was vehemently argued that there is nothing on record to 
reflect that the Federal Government had any input in the decision-making 
process which led to the Pakistan Army entering into a commercial 
arrangement with the GOP, which is a gross violation of the mandate of 
Article 245 of the Constitution. The attempt on the part of the Respondents

to differentiate ‘executive’ and ‘commercial’ functions of the State to 
demonstrate that CAF initiative being a commercial function did not 
envisage any role of the Federal Government is not borne from the Rules, 
1973 and the Army Act and is, even otherwise, violative of the express 
determinations reached by the Superior Courts.  
64. 
 
Mr. Ahmed Rafay Alam, Advocate supplemented the 
arguments by contending that even otherwise, the new SOCs and the JVA 
executed thereunder, both contradict and conflict with stated Federal and 
Provincial policies as well as international best practices. Without 
prejudice to the fact that even if it is assumed, without conceding in any 
way, shape or form, that the new SOCs have been validly issued and that 
the JVA has been competently entered into and that the same is not in 
contradiction to the original SOCs and the Colonization Act, the argument 
that the same are to protect ‘food security’ raised by the Respondents is 
contradictory to their own stated policies and liable to be declared illegal, 
being unreasoned, on this score alone. To this effect, it was submitted that 
Vision, Mission, Goals and Strategic Framework of National Food 
Security Policy, 2018 do not mention increase in arable land or need for 
CAF. 
65. 
 
Pakistan’s National Climate Change Policy, 2012 (updated in 
2021) states that Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate change may lead to 
food security issues and proposes policy measures. None of the policy 
measures include CAF and as a general measures, it is proposed to 
promote horizontal expansion of cultivable lands through development of 
wastelands and rainwater harvesting through community-based approaches 
to development. Thus, as a policy measure thrust is upon expansion of 
arable land through development of wastelands but through community 
participation and not CAF. Similarly, it seeks to ensure food security based 
on livestock and pasture management and makes policy measures in this 
regard which do not include CAF or increasing pastureland but adopts as a 
policy measure to protect the rights of indigenous peoples.

66. 
 
Punjab Agriculture Policy, 2018 does not once mention CAF. 
A key focus in addressing the agriculture related issues of growth, poverty 
reduction and food security is strengthening the voice and status of women 
in the rural Punjab. It further seeks to employ Climate Smart Agriculture to 
ensure food security. It was further informed that Pakistan adopted UN 
SDGs in 2016. SDG is Zero Hunger (“End hunger, Achieve Food Security, 
Improve Nutrition and Promote Sustainable Agriculture”) and in this 
respect, GOP’s Zero Hunger SDG goals do not include CAF or increasing 
arable land.  
67. 
 
He argued that there are several examples of success in terms 
of reducing hunger, transforming the agriculture sector and enhancing 
smallholder productivity. The thrust of international best practices have 
been to support small farm holdings and to support vulnerable farmers.  
Thus, the idea that CAF is the answer for food security appears to be 
misplaced and a thorough research is required regarding the basis of CAF 
initiative. 
68. 
 
Finally, it was concluded that the Superior Courts have 
evolved a ‘Doctrine of Public Trust’ relating to the regulation and 
consumption of natural resources. This doctrine was approved by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case of Cutting of Trees for Canal Widening 
Project, Lahore12.  The doctrine was first introduced by the Sindh High 
Court in Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation13 case. The 
doctrine set out briefly in Muhammad Tariq Abbasi14 case, enjoins the 
State to preserve and protect the public interest in beaches, lakeshores etc. 
and that this Court has recognized the ‘Public Trust Doctrine’ extending it 
to the natural resources, viz, air, sea, water and forests, which being a gift 
of nature should be made freely available to everyone irrespective of

status. Further, the Supreme Court, in Maulana Abdul Haque Baloch15 case 
declared that minerals in land are in the nature of public trust and that 
mineral rules ‘act as guardians of the said public trust’. The upshot of the 
above reflects that, even otherwise, the ‘public good’ argued by the 
respective governments in allowing the transaction impugned herein is 
misleading. This is even otherwise without prejudice to the fact that an 
illegal arrangement cannot be condoned in the public good. 
69. 
 
Mr. Shahid Shahood Randhawa, Advocate while endorsing 
the aforesaid submissions, highlighted the legal and social dangers 
associated with the impugned transaction. He said that the new SOCs were 
in fact tailored with mala fide intention to accommodate the Pakistan 
Army as a preconceived plan by thwarting the constitutional and legal 
mandate. The Pakistan Army used its undue influence and coercion as a 
powerful and dominant institution to usurp State land under the garb of the 
impugned transaction. As such, the institution which is essentially created 
for the protection and security of the State and its people went beyond its 
constitutional and legal mandate to usurp the public property in breach of 
the fundamental rights of the people. He explained that the concept of 
lease and joint venture are completely different and the latter is in conflict 
with the scheme of law envisaged in the Colonization Act which only 
allows disposal of State land through a transparent and non-discriminatory 
leasing scheme. An arbitrary and self-serving definition of lease was 
deliberately inserted in the new SOCs to assign a new meaning to the 
concept of ‘lease’ in derogation to applicable law. The JVA is also void for 
being uncertain as it relates to unidentified and undisclosed public property 
in terms of Section 29 of the Contract Act, 1872. He stressed that the 
impugned transaction has been executed under black clouds of secrecy in a 
deeply non-transparent manner without advertisement in order to achieve 
the sinister design of extending extraordinary and undue favour to the

Pakistan Army by the Caretaker Government. The impugned transaction is 
fraudulent within the contemplation of provisions contained in Section 23 
of the Contract Act, 1872 as it defeats the express provisions of the 
Constitution and law, is unconscionable and inflicts irreparable injury to 
public property. Hence, the transaction is opposed to public policy being in 
breach of public trust and as such, is not condonable. The undue haste 
shown in the approval of the impugned transaction by the Caretaker 
Cabinet in absence of any mandate itself testifies that the transaction is 
fraudulent. The sovereignty and independence of the future elected 
government was compromised by conferring its powers to the Negotiating 
Committee which tantamount to confiscation of executive and legislative 
prerogatives of the future elected governments. He relied upon case of 
District Bar Association, Khanewal; and Suo motu case No. 13 of 200916. 
He rested his case by urging that public policy especially with respect to 
the State immovable property must be non-discriminatory carried out 
through advertisement in open auction mode with a specified ceiling so 
that most of the people can get benefit out of it. The following passage of 
John Steinbeck’s “Grapes of Wrath” was cited in terms of Paragraph No. 
13 of Brig. Muhammad Bashir17 case:- 
“And the great owner, who must lose their land in an 
upheaval, the great owners with access to history, with eyes to 
read history and to know the great fact: when property 
accumulates in too few hands it is taken away. And that 
companion fact: when a majority of the people are hungry and 
cold they will take by force what they need. And the little 
screaming fact that sounds through all history repression 
works only to strengthen and knit the repressed. The great 
owners ignored the three cries of history. The land fell into 
fewer hands the number of the dispossessed increased and

every effort of the great owners was directed at repression. 
The money was spent for arms for gas to protect the great 
holdings, and spies were sent to catch the murmuring of revolt 
so that it might be stamped out The changing economy was 
ignored, plans for the change ignored, and only means to 
destroy revolt were considered, while the causes of revolt 
went on.” 
 
70. 
 
Learned counsels representing the Petitioners in connected 
Petitions adopted the above arguments and additionally discussed the 
distinguishing features of their respective grievances. It was essentially 
stated that in case CAF initiative is allowed despite constitutional and legal 
challenges thereto, even then the subject-matter lands highlighted in the 
connected Petitions are liable to be excluded from CAF initiative for due 
protection of rights and interests asserted by the Petitioners therein. 
  
IV.  CONTENTIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS 
71. 
 
Mr. Muhammad Osman Khan, learned Assistant Advocate 
General led the arguments on behalf of the Respondents. Questioning the 
maintainability of the Petitions, it was pointed out at the outset that under 
the garb of public interest litigation or acting pro bono publico, the titled 
Petition has been filed by a Karachi based NGO, source of funds and intent 
whereof remains unclear. Similarly, connected W. P. No. 23256 / 23 has 
been filed by a practicing Advocate. Both the Petitions clearly fail to meet the 
basic requirement of Article 199(1)(a) of the Constitution as none of the 
Petitioners therein is an aggrieved person. Similarly, the other Petitioners in 
the connected Petitions are not aggrieved persons as the land is vested in the 
GOP and the latter has every right to deal with it in the best public interest. 
72. 
 
It was vehemently argued that this Court lacks power to 
undertake Judicial Review of the impugned transaction for the reason that 
the same falls within the exclusive policy domain of the GOP. It was 
stressed that the constitutional scheme is based upon the trichotomy of 
powers entrenched in our legal jurisprudence and is liable to be honoured 
by this Court. In this regard, he quoted paragraph No. 12 of the Judgment

passed by the Supreme Court in Syed Azam Shah18 case which is 
reproduced as under:-  
“12. …The compass and magnitude of judicial review of 
governmental policy is now well settled and defined in which 
neither the court can act or represent as appellate authority 
with the aim of scrutinizing the rightness, fittingness and 
aptness of a policy nor may act as advisor to the executives on 
matters of policy which they are entitled to formulate. The 
extensiveness of judicial review of a policy is to test out 
whether it violates the fundamental rights of the citizens or is 
at variance to the provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to 
any statutory provision or demonstrably arbitrary or 
discriminately. … In the case of Abdul Hameed and others. v. 
Water and Power Development Authority through Chairman, 
Lahore and others (2021 SCMR 1230), this Court held that 
the roles of each organ of the State are defined within the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, so also in 
different laws. It is not the role of the Courts to interfere in 
policy decisions, unless it is manifest that such a policy 
decisions are the outcome of arbitrary exercise of power, mala 
fides, patently illegal or manifestly unreasonable. The court 
placed reliance on the case of Asaf Fasihuddin Khan v. 
Government of Pakistan (2014 SCMR 676), in which it was 
held that the duty of the Court is to confine itself to the 
question of legality, whether a decision making authority 
exceeded its powers; committed an error of law; committed a 
breach of the rules of natural justice; reached a decision which 
no reasonable tribunal would have reached or abused its 
powers.” 
 
73. 
 
Further, the case of Messrs Power Construction Corporation 
of China Ltd.19 relates to a Chinese Company which participated in the 
Hydropower Project whose name was included in the pre-qualification 
bidders but was subsequently deleted and the company was declared 
disqualified. The following was importantly observed by the Supreme 
Court in the said case:-

“27. …It appears that a pragmatic commercial decision was 
taken not to jeopardize the funding from the IDA and thereby 
putting the entire project at risk. Such decision falls within the 
realm of the Public Policy and the Courts in the exercise of 
their powers of judicial Review, ordinarily, do not interfere 
therewith and exercise judicial restrain, as has been held by 
this Court not only in the case, reported as Dossani Travels 
Pvt. Ltd and others v. Messrs Travels Shop (Pvt.) Ltd. and 
others (PLD 2014 SC 1) but also in the judgment, reported as 
Cutting of Trees for Canal Widening Projects, Lahore: In the 
matter of Suo Motu Case No.25 of 2009 (2011 SCMR 1743). 
… as in our opinion, the Constitutional Petition filed by the 
Petitioner Company was not maintainable, as it sought to 
encroach into the domain of the Policy Matters in respect 
whereof the judicial restrain is to be exercised.” 
 
74. 
 
Learned Assistant Advocate General stressed that this Court 
in exercise of power of Judicial Review could not scrutinize the policy 
decision or substitute its own opinion instead of the GOP. Reliance was 
placed on Wattan Party20 case. Paragraph No. 57 thereof is reproduced as 
under:- 
“57. The next question is in respect of the judicial review of 
the policies of the Government. It is well settled that normally 
in exercise of the powers of judicial review this Court will not 
scrutinize the policy decisions or to substitute its own opinion 
in such matters as held in Messrs Elahi Cotton Mills ibid. 
Likewise in the case of Balco Employees ibid, the Supreme 
Court of India observed as follows: 
 
“Process of disinvestments is a policy decision 
involving complex economic factors. The Courts have 
consistently refrained from interfering with economic 
decisions as it has been recognized that economic 
expediencies lack adjudicative disposition and unless 
the 
economic 
decision, 
based 
on 
economic 
expediencies, is demonstrated to be so violative of 
constitutional or legal limits on power or so abhorrent 
to reason, that the Courts would decline to interfere. In 
matters relating to economic issues, the Government 
has while taking a decision, right to "trial and error" as

Leveling a serious concern on the locus standi of the 
Petitioners, learned Law Officer argued that the Petitioners have no 
legitimate right and standing to question an important initiative of CAF 
which goes to the roots of food security for the people of Punjab and in 
fact, the initiation of the project is in public interest which could not be 
jeopardized through judicial intervention. Frivolous Petitions are liable to 
be discouraged and thrown out to foster public interest. To substantiate his 
point, he referred the judgment passed by the Supreme Court in the case of 
Dr. Akhtar Hassan Khan21. The relevant paragraph thereof is reproduced as 
under:- 
“50. While holding that these petitions are maintainable, we 
would like to strike a note of caution. The Court has to guard 
against frivolous petitions as it is a matter of common 
observation that in the garb of public interest litigation, 
matters are brought before the Court which are neither of 
public importance nor relatable to enforcement of a 
fundamental right or public duty. In Ashok Kumar Pandey v. 
State of West Bengal (AIR 2004 SC 280) the Court was 
seized of such a petition when it observed as follows:- 
 
“Public interest litigation is a weapon which has to be 
used with great care and circumspection and the 
judiciary has to be extremely careful to see that behind 
the beautiful veil of public interest an ugly private 
malice, vested interest and/or publicity seeking is not 
lurking. It is to be used as an effective weapon in the 
armory of law for delivering social justice to the 
citizens. The attractive brand name of public interest 
litigation should not be used for suspicious products of 
mischief. It should be aimed at redressal of genuine 
public wrong or public injury and not publicity oriented 
or founded on personal vendetta. As indicated above, 
Court must be careful to see that a body of persons or 
member of public, who approaches the court is acting 
bona fide and not for personal gain or private motive or 
political motivation or other oblique consideration. The

Court must not allow its process to be abused for 
oblique considerations. Some persons with vested 
interest indulge in the pastime of meddling with 
judicial process either by force of habit or from 
improper motives. Often they are actuated by a desire 
to win notoriety or cheap popularity. The petitions of 
such busy bodies deserve to be thrown out by rejection 
at the threshold, and in appropriate cases with 
exemplary costs.” 
 
He further relied upon the case of Ashok Kumar Pandey22. The germane 
extract therefrom is reproduced hereunder:- 
“The Court has to be satisfied about (a) the credentials of the 
applicant; (b) the prima facie correctness or nature of 
information given by him; (c) the information being not vague 
and indefinite. The information should show gravity and 
seriousness involved. Court has to strike balance between two 
conflicting interests; (i) nobody should be allowed to indulge 
in wild and reckless allegations besmirching the character of 
others; and (ii) avoidance of public mischief and to avoid 
mischievous petitions seeking to assail, for oblique motives, 
justifiable executive actions. In such case, however, the Court 
cannot afford to be liberal. It has to be extremely careful to 
see that under the guise of redressing a public grievance, it 
does not encroach upon the sphere reserved by the 
Constitution to the Executive and the Legislature. The Court 
has to act ruthlessly while dealing with imposters and busy 
bodies or meddlesome interlopers impersonating as public-
spirited holy men. They masquerade as crusaders of justice. 
They pretend to act in the name of Pro Bono Publico, though 
they have no interest of the public or even of their own to 
protect. 
 
Courts must do justice by promotion of good faith, and 
prevent law from crafty invasions. Courts must maintain the 
social balance by interfering where necessary for the sake of 
justice and refuse to interfere where it is against the social 
interest and public good. (See State of Maharashtra vs. 
Prabhu, (1994 (2) SCC 481), and Andhra Pradesh State 
Financial Corporation vs. M/s GAR Re-Rolling Mills and 
Anr., (AIR 1994 SC 2151). No litigant has a right to unlimited 
drought on the Court time and public money in order to get 
his affairs settled in the manner as he wishes. Easy access to 
justice should not be misused as a licence to file misconceived

and frivolous petitions. (See Dr. B.K. Subbarao vs. Mr. K. 
Parasaran, (1996) 7 JT 265). Today people rush to Courts to 
file cases in profusion under this attractive name of public 
interest. They must inspire confidence in Courts and among 
the public. 
 
As noted supra, a time has come to weed out the petitions, 
which though titled as public interest litigations are in essence 
something else. It is shocking to note that Courts are flooded 
with large number of so called public interest litigations 
where even a minuscule percentage can legitimately be called 
as public interest litigations. Though the parameters of public 
interest litigation have been indicated by this Court in large 
number of cases, yet unmindful of the real intentions and 
objectives, Courts are entertaining such petitions and wasting 
valuable judicial time which, as noted above, could be 
otherwise utilized for disposal of genuine cases….” 
 
To further substantiate his points, he also cited other case law23. 
 
76. 
 
He vehemently stated that mandamus can only be invoked by 
an aggrieved person while the Petitioners lack this mandatory 
characteristic. Hence, the Petitions are not maintainable before this Court 
on this score alone. To supplement this argument, the following passages 
were quoted:- 
“Note:  
11. As the writ petitions filed before the Lahore High Court, 
eventually leading to the judgments under review, were for 
the issuance of either writ of Certiorari or Mandamus, they 
could have been maintained only by an aggrieved person

within the meaning of Article 199 of the Constitution. As held 
above, neither Noor Elahi nor Syed Khurram Ali Shah 
fulfilled that condition. The writ petitions filed by these two 
persons were, therefore, not maintainable…”24 
 
“19.  In order to invoke Constitutional jurisdiction under 
Article 199 of The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, seeking relief by way of writ of "Mandamus" or 
"Certiorari" there must be an "aggrieved party" calling in 
question "Action" or "Omission" of a person, functioning in 
connection with affairs of the Federation, a province or a local 
authority provided no other adequate  remedy is available to 
such party.”25 
 
He also relied upon the cases of M. Ghulam Nabi Awan, Advocate and 
Peshawar University Teacher’s Association (PUTA)26. 
77. 
 
On merits, it was submitted that the summary for the Chief 
Minister, Punjab qua the original SOCs was moved during the tenure of 
the Elected Government on 25.06.2021 which after passing through 
different stages including the Standing Committee was eventually 
approved ‘in-principle’, in the 51st meeting of the Elected Cabinet held on 
28.02.2022. Placing the matter before the Provincial Assembly was not 
mandatory as CAF initiative did not require any specific legislation to be 
passed, as such, the only requirement of approval by the GOP was duly 
met through approval by the Elected Cabinet as envisaged under Section 
10(2) of the Colonization Act. After the in-principal approval, the Elected 
Cabinet desired the placement of original SOCs before the Ministerial 
Committee which was duly held on 14.10.2022 in which the original SOCs 
were further considered and thrashed out and ultimately placed before the 
Caretaker Cabinet in its 4th meeting held on 09.02.2023. With regard to

non-issuance of minutes of meeting of the Ministerial Committee created 
by the Cabinet, it was stated that the Special Committees of the Cabinet 
are constituted under the command of Rule 25(3) of the Rules, 2011 which 
reads as follows:- 
“The Cabinet may constitute Standing or Special Committees 
of the Cabinet and may assign to each a class of cases or a 
particular case.” 
78. 
 
As is evident from a bare reading of above, the Committees 
are creatures of the Cabinet in order to assist and aid the Cabinet as and 
when required. The Committees do not have an independent constitutional 
or statutory existence or mandate since they are created by the Cabinet for 
assistance in its day to day working. These Committees cannot be said to 
have any independent role in executive decision making of the GOP which 
is the sole prerogative and function of the Cabinet. Therefore, input from 
these Committees is but only for the consumption of the Cabinet. Further, 
the Cabinet can take any executive decision on any matter of the Province 
without referring the same to any of these Committees, considering that 
the role of the latter is but only to further thrash out any case referred to 
them by the Cabinet. Even otherwise, non-issuance of minutes was 
brought into the knowledge of the Caretaker Cabinet, which then 
proceeded to take the decision, therefore, non-issuance thereof had been 
virtually rendered of no legal consequence, since the Caretaker Cabinet 
being a higher body had taken cognizance of the matter and passed a 
decision exercising its constitutional mandate. 
79. 
 
 The procedure regarding proceedings of the Committees of 
the Cabinet is provided in Rule 29 of the Rules, 2011, whereby, provisions 
of Rules 26 and 28 thereof apply mutatis mutandis to the Committees as 
well. Further, reference was also made to the sub Clauses (8), (9) & (14) of 
Rule 28 of the Rules, 2011, to contend that the said provisions are 
abundantly clear that a Secretary shall attend every meeting of the Cabinet 
(unless otherwise directed) and may also, attend a meeting of the Cabinet

in place of his Minister. As such, a Secretary can also attend the meetings 
of a Ministerial Committee and such a meeting would be deemed to have 
been held. It may also be highlighted that every organization of a 
Department, as per Rule 4 of the Rules, 2011, consists of a Minister and a 
Secretary and such other officials as may be determined by the GOP. 
80. 
 
As regards the specific facts of meeting of Ministerial 
Committee dated 14.10.2022, it was submitted that a note for Minister of 
Law and Parliamentary Affairs for placing the matter before the 
Ministerial Committee was moved on 10.08.2022 by the Member 
(Colonies), BOR. Then the Minister of Law vide noting dated 07.09.2022 
sought a clarification as to who shall chair the meeting of Ministerial 
Committee i.e. the Minister of Law, Punjab or the Minister for 
Parliamentary Affairs, Punjab? It may be pointed out that previously, Law 
and Parliamentary Affairs was constituted as one portfolio with one 
Minister. However, after redistribution of portfolios, there were two 
Ministers, that is, Minister for Law (Mr. Khurram Shahzad Virk) and the 
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs (Mr. Muhammad Basharat Raja). As 
such, upon clarification from the then Chief Minister, Punjab dated 
30.09.2022, the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs gave his nod vide noting 
dated 04.10.2022, for convening the meeting of Ministerial Committee on 
14.10.2022. In this regard, letter dated 13.10.2022 was issued by the BOR 
being the Department concerned. Thereafter, meeting of Ministerial 
Committee was held on 14.10.2022 as depicted from the Attendance Sheet 
placed on record. As such, the meeting took place lawfully and non-
issuance of minutes thereof can, at best, be taken as a procedural 
irregularity and therefore, of no legal consequence since through the 
formal summary, the matter was brought into the knowledge of the higher 
forum i.e. the Caretaker Cabinet, which, accordingly took decision.  
81. 
 
Learned Law Officer submitted that the term ‘in principle 
approval’ is of great significance as the same was accorded by the Elected 
Cabinet in the year 2022 and the new SOCs were notified during the tenure

W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
of the Caretaker Cabinet after input from all the relevant Departments. The 
phrase ‘in principle’ means ‘in theory’27 or ‘theoretically or in essence’28. 
As per online Collins Dictionary, the term ‘in principle’ means that ‘if you 
agree with something in principle, you agree in general terms to the idea of 
it, although you do not yet know the details or know if it will be possible’. 
82. 
 
In view of the foregoing, it was submitted that the term ‘in 
principle approval’ as used by the GOP while considering a novel project 
signifies its approval in ‘essence’ qua any project under consideration 
while details and possible dimensions were left to be further thrashed out 
by the relevant stakeholders. Since the principle approval qua CAF project 
was granted during the tenure of the previous Elected Government, the 
concerned Departments completed the spadework and only placed it before 
the Caretaker Cabinet on 09.02.2023 for its nod qua notification of the new 
SOCs so prepared by the relevant Departments. 
83. 
 
Responding to the argument that the new SOCs ought not to 
have been issued or notified by the Governor Punjab, he submitted that 
conjunctive reading of Articles 129 and 139 of the Constitution leads to 
the conclusion that the executive authority of the Province ought to be 
exercised in the name of the Governor. Further, Article 139(3) mandates 
the making of rules for allocation and transaction of the business of the 
Province. It is under the command and in furtherance of this provision that 
the GOP made the Rules, 2011. Apart from the above constitutional 
provision, while meeting the mandate and express command thereof, Rule 
12(1) of the Rules, 2011 provides as follows: 
“All executive actions of the Government shall be expressed 
to be taken in the name of the Governor.” 
 
84. 
 
Further, as per the Third Schedule, Part-A to the Rules, 2011, 
a list of cases has been provided that require orders of the Governor. It 
may be clarified that the issuance of SOCs has not been mentioned or

provided in the said list. As such, after getting the requisite approval from 
the Caretaker Cabinet and satisfying the essence of Mustafa Impex Case as 
well, the new SOCs were issued on 20.02.2023 in exercise of powers 
conferred vide Section 10 of the Colonization Act. Stating the scope of 
Article 139 of the Constitution, he relied upon the following dicta laid in 
Aftab Ali29 case: 
“11.  …As already pointed out, though the executive 
authority of the province is to be exercised in the name of the 
Governor, but it is to be exercised by the Provincial 
Government through the Chief Minister, the other Ministers 
or the officers to whom powers of Provincial Government 
may have been delegated under clause (2) of Article 139 of 
the Constitution. Rule 5 of the Sind Government Rules of 
Business provides that the cases enumerated in Schedule III 
of the Rules shall be submitted to the Governor for approval. 
The learned Additional Advocate General conceded that this 
Schedule does not include cases of remission and suspension 
of sentences granted by the Provincial Government under 
section 401, Cr. P. C. In Venkatesh Yeshwant Deshpande v. 
Emperor(I) (AIR 1938 Nag. 513), Deshpande had prayed to 
the High Court for an order for being set at liberty on the 
ground that in view of the remission earned by him, including 
the remissions granted by the Local Government and the 
Premier of the Province, he was entitled to be released but 
was nevertheless being illegally detained. It was contended on 
behalf of the Government that though, in view of the 
remissions earned by Deshpande, he was entitled to be 
released, but two days before the date of his release, the Local 
Government had varied its previous order and directed that he 
should not be released until further orders, Deshpande mainly 
relied, in support of his claim for release, on an order 
remitting one year of his sentence. This order was made in the 
name of the Governor but was not issued or approved by him. 
A Full Bench of the Nagpur High Court held the order of 
remission to be valid and observed as follows:- 
 
It is perhaps necessary to explain that though the order 
is in the name of the Governor, that is the 
Constitutional form it has to take. It is in reality an 
order of the Provincial Government. In view of the 
general misunderstanding on this point the Provincial 
Government felt it necessary, after it had issued its

order of cancellation dated 28th May, 1938, to issue a 
press communique explaining this difference. It should 
be understood that what is here involved are the acts, 
powers and privileges of the Provincial Government 
and not of His Excellency the Governor.” 
 
85. 
 
With regard to the question of previous instances of issuance 
of SOCs by the Governor himself, learned Assistant Advocate General 
placed on record copies of following three notifications to contend that all 
the executive authority is exercised in the name of the Governor:- 
(i) 
SOCs issued vide Notification No. 2104-2019/751-
CL(II) dated 13.09.2019 for Grant of Lease to 
Charitable Institutions or Organizations; 
 
(ii) 
SOCs issued vide Notification No. 1835-2019/625-
CS(II) dated 13.09.2019 for Disposal of abandoned 
paths, passages and water courses or ponds falling 
within the private housing schemes; and 
 
(iii) SOCs issued vide Notification No. 1610-2022/1400-
CSIII 
dated 
14.04.2022, 
whereby, 
SOCs 
vide 
Notification 
No. 
1835-2019/625-CS(II) 
dated 
13.09.2019 were amended as provided therein. 
 
86. 
 
As such, in view of the foregoing, it was submitted that the 
new SOCs have been issued validly which do not suffer from any legal 
infirmity. It was also highlighted in this respect that the Colonies 
Department has been authorized vide Second Schedule to Rules, 2011, 
under the head of “Board of Revenue – (a) Colonies Department”, Entry 
No. 9 to transfer the State land from one Department to another and to the 
Federal Government.  
87. 
 
It was next contended about the powers of a caretaker 
government that if the intent of the law-makers was confined to the 
conduct of elections only, this function could have best been performed by 
the Election Commission itself. However, a careful and open-minded 
reading of Section 230 of the Elections Act shall bring forth certain 
unmistakable and equally important role and functions of the Caretaker

Government. Section 230 of the Elections Act mandates or provides both 
positive and negative covenants. The decision taken by the Caretaker 
Cabinet is fully covered within the ambit and scope of the aforesaid 
provision of law as the same was necessary to run the day to day business 
of the GOP; was non-controversial; urgent; in public interest; and 
reversible by the future elected government. At this juncture, several 
important questions crop up: (i) If ensuring food security in the most 
populous Province of Pakistan, i.e. Punjab, shall not be a ‘day-to-day 
function of the GOP’, what else is? (ii) If the ever-increasing challenge qua 
food security does not constitute an ‘urgent and non-controversial’ affair, 
then what else does? (iii) If a project aimed at ensuring food security, not 
only in the Province but also in the country (as Punjab is considered to be 
the bread basket of Pakistan), does not constitute a matter of ‘public 
interest’, what else shall? and lastly (iv) since as per Clause 8 titled 
‘Special Provisions’ of the JVA, whereby, no proprietary rights shall 
accrue to the lessee, tenure of the lease is for a fixed period of 20+10 years 
(neither extendable nor renewable) and the land (whole or any part thereof) 
can be resumed at any time even before the expiry of the JVA, how can the 
arrangement be regarded as irreversible? Further, the new SOCs qua CAF 
can be reversed by the future elected government through a simple policy 
notification to such an effect. As such, the new SOCs and the JVA do not 
constitute irreversible activities. 
88. 
 
Similarly, in case of negative covenants as contained in 
Section 230(2) of the Elections Act, each stipulation is qualified with an 
exception. The provision states that a caretaker government shall not take 
major policy decisions, except on urgent matters. If food security does not 
constitute an urgent matter, what else does? Since the new SOCs and the 
JVA constitute an arrangement arising therefrom that is reversible and not 
permanent coupled with the fact that under the Punjab General Clauses 
Act, 1956, the new SOCs can be withdrawn by the future elected 
government, the new SOCs and the JVA constitute a reversible

arrangement for all intents and purposes and do not prevent the exercise of 
authority by the future elected government. 
89. 
 
Interpreting ‘shall not enter into a major contract or 
undertaking if it is detrimental to public interest’, he explained that the 
word ‘if’ is of immense significance in this sentence as it signifies that a 
caretaker government can enter into a major contract or undertaking as 
long as it is not contrary to public interest. Hence, given the reversible and 
urgent nature of CAF project, principle approval whereof had been granted 
by an Elected Government, if same is not outrightly in public interest, 
what else is? The fact that the matter relates to ‘food security’ makes an 
imperative for any government regardless of its status since the same also 
derives its validity and force from Article 38(d) of the Constitution which 
mandates the State to provide basic necessities of life, such as food, 
clothing, housing, education and medical relief, for all such citizens, 
irrespective of sex, caste, creed or race, as are permanently or temporarily 
unable to earn their livelihood on account of infirmity, sickness or 
unemployment. Reliance was also placed on the Principles of Policy 
enshrined in Articles 29 & 30 of the Constitution. He explained that the 
importance of Principles of Policy has been highlighted in Miss Benazir 
Bhutto 30 case in the following words:-  
“This ideal can only be achieved under the rule of law by 
adopting the democratic way of life as ensured by 
Fundamental Rights and Principles of Policy. The intention of 
the framers of the Constitution is to implement the principles 
of social and economic justice enshrined in the Principles of 
Policy within the framework of Fundamental Rights. Chapters 
I and II of Part II of the Constitution which incorporate 
Fundamental Rights and directive principles of State policy, 
respectively occupy a place of pride in the scheme of the 
Constitution, and these are the conscience of the Constitution, 
as they constitute the main thrust of the commitment to socio 
economic justice. The directive principles of State Policy are 
to be regarded as fundamentals to the governance of the State

but they are not enforceable by any Court. Nonetheless, they 
are the basis of all legislative and executive actions by the 
State for implementing the principles laid down therein. As 
the principles of democracy are not based on dogmas and also 
do not accept the theory of absolutes in any sphere of socio-
economic justice, therefore, the authors of the Constitution, 
by enumerating the Fundamental Rights and the Principles of 
Policy, apparently did so in the belief that the proper and 
rational synthesis of the provisions of the two parts would 
lead to the establishment of an egalitarian society under the 
rule of law. However, while implementing the directive 
Principles of Policy, the State should not make any law which 
takes away or abridges the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by 
Chapter I in view of the embargo placed by Article 8(1) and 
(2). Necessarily, therefore, the directive principles of State 
Policy have to conform to and to operate as subsidiary to the 
Fundamental Rights guaranteed in Chapter 1, otherwise the 
protective provisions of the Chapter will be a mere rope of 
sand. Law, in the achievement of this ideal, has to play a 
major role, i.e., it has to serve as a vehicle of social and 
economic justice which this Court is free to interpret.”

Similarly, right to food has been declared as a fundamental 
right in various Judgments of the Superior Courts, the relevant portions 
whereof were relied upon which are reproduced herein below: 
“3. … Learned Additional Attorney-General stated that it is 
job of the provincial governments to control prices in terms of 
The Price Control and Prevention of Profiteering and 
Hoarding Act, 1977 read with Foodstuffs (Control) Act 1958 
which is applicable to all the Provinces. There is no doubt that 
food security has to be ensured by the Federal Government 
and for this purpose a Ministry in the name of National Food 
Security and Research has been created and this Ministry has 
fixed the price of wheat as Rs. 1200 per 40 k.g. for the year 
2012-2013 meaning thereby that ordinarily at the cost of 
Rs.30 per k.g. wheat shall be made available and the 
Provincial Governments are also duty bound to ensure that the 
wheat/Ata is supplied and being sold at the subsidized rates. 
Section 3 of the Foodstuffs (Control) Act, 1958 confers 
powers upon the Government to control supply, distribution 
etc. of foodstuffs…. 
 
4. 
It is also to be noted that under Article 38 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan it is 
responsibility of the State to secure the well-being of the

people by raising their standard of living, by preventing the 
concentration of wealth and means of production and 
distribution in the hands of a few to the detriment of general 
interest and to make adequate livelihood with reasonable rest 
and leisure. Clause (d) of the same provides that the State 
shall make available basic necessities of life, such as food, 
clothing, housing, education and medical relief for all such 
citizens irrespective of sex, caste, creed or race. But, prima 
facie, it appears that no such mechanism has been adopted so 
far by the Government in this respect.”31 
 
“2. …and now in continuation thereof it is well settled that 
right to food, water, decent environment, education, medical 
care and livelihood are inherent in right to life; which also 
encompasses within its fold right to social security…”32 
 
“11. Our courts have expanded the right to life over time and 
held that it includes "the right to legal aid; the right to speedy 
trial; the right to bare necessities of life; protection against 
adverse effects of electro-magnetic fields; the right to pure 
and unpolluted water; the right of access to justice;" the right 
to livelihood, the right to travel, the right to food, water, 
decent environment, education and medical care…”33 
 
91. 
 
Since, food is not only a matter as provided in Principles of 
Policy of the Constitution but in the light of above dicta of the Superior 
Courts, it is also amply clear that the same constitutes a fundamental right 
and any policy made in furtherance of the goal to secure this cardinal right 
for the people of Pakistan, shall qualify for all the functions as well as 
exceptions as provided within the scope of Section 230 of the Elections 
Act. 
92. 
 
Although, the arguments and averments of Petitioners’ side 
relied on a selective reading of the text of various law(s) and stipulations 
of the impugned new SOCs and the JVA, however, as per the dicta of the 
Superior Courts as well as in accordance with jurisprudence as has 
developed in the matter, the Courts are more inclined to adopt and further

an approach of purposive and harmonious interpretation of Statues so as to 
give full meaning and effect to various provisions of law. In this regard, 
reliance was placed on JS Bank Limited34 case, wherein, it was held in 
paragraph No. 13 as under:- 
“13.  Moreover, the legal text must be interpreted in the 
context of its purpose. This Court has consistently ruled that a 
purposive rather than a literal approach to interpretation is to 
be adopted while interpreting Statutes. An interpretation 
which advances the purpose of the Act is to be preferred 
rather than an interpretation which defeats its objects. 
Reference can be made to the judgments reported as "Saif-Ur-
Rehman v. Additional District Judge, Tuba Tek Singh and 2 
others" (2018 SCMR 1885) and "Rab Nawaz Dhadwanai 
Advocate and others v. Rana Muhammad Akram Advocate 
and others" (PLD 2014 Lahore 591).” 
 
Further reliance was place on the cases of Saif-ur-Rehman; Messrs Sui 
Southern Gas Company Limited; Hudabiya Engineering (Pvt.) Limited; 
and Dr. Tariq Iqbal35. It was importantly held in referred Dr. Tariq Iqbal 
case as under:- 
 
“8. Before embarking upon the exercise for attempting to 
interpret the aforesaid provision, it may be appropriate to 
restate the cardinal and well settled principle of interpretation, 
which requires that a purposive rather than a literal approach 
of interpretation be adopted as has been held by this Court 
inter alia, in the judgment reported as Federation of Pakistan 
through Ministry of Finance and others v. Messrs Noori 
Trading Corporation (Private) Limited and 14 others (1992 
SCMR 710), Hudabiya Engineering (Pvt.) Limited v. Pakistan

11. It is in the above backdrop, the contention of the learned 
Additional Advocate General, KPK that a person employed 
by any department, office or agency that has its own pool of 
residential accommodation is not entitled or eligible for 
allotment of accommodation in the general pool even though 
he is also not entitled to be considered for allotment of 
residential accommodation in the department, office or 
agency where he is currently employed cannot be occupied. 
Such an interpretation would disentitle such persons from 
residential accommodation both in the department, office or 
agency as well as in the general pool. Such interpretation 
could not be considered to be either logical, purposive or 
beneficial. When viewed in its true perspective, it is clear and 
obvious that section 7(3) of the Act of 2018 merely provides 
that a public office holder can either be entitled to or eligible 
for allotment in the general pool or in the pool of his own 
department, office or agency if it has such a pool but a public 
office holder not eligible for allotment under the pool of his 
department, office or agency, is obviously, eligible for 
allotment in the general pool, as it cannot be the intention of 
the legislature to totally exclude such public office holder 
from any and all official residential accommodations.” 
 
93. 
 
As such, interpretation of extant provisions of law has to be 
undertaken with a more purposive approach with regard to various 
challenges qua laws and their scope especially in situations, where an 
apparent limited scope of a particular provision of law may result in a 
situation that may defeat the very purpose of that law. 
94. 
 
In this regard, Lord Denning in the case of Seaford Court 
Estates, Ltd.36 expressed the view regarding the principle laid down in 
Winchester Court37 case in the following terms:-  
“Whenever a statute comes up for consideration it must be 
remembered that it is not within human powers to foresee the 
manifold sets of facts which may arise, and, even if it were, it 
is not possible to provide for them in terms free from all 
ambiguity. The English language is not an instrument of 
mathematical precision. Our literature would be much the 
poorer if it were. This is where the draftsmen of Acts of 
Parliament have often been unfairly criticized. A Judge, 
                                              
36 Seaford Court Estates, Ltd. v. Asher (1949 All E.L.R. 155 (Vol.2))

believing himself to be fettered by the supposed rule that he 
must look to the language and nothing else, laments that the 
draftsmen have not provided for this or that, or have been 
guilty of some or other ambiguity. It would certainly save the 
judges trouble if Acts of Parliament were drafted with divine 
prescience and perfect clarity. In the absence of it, when a 
defect appears a judge cannot simply fold his hands and 
blame the draftsman. He must set to work on the constructive 
task of finding the intention of Parliament, and he must do 
this not only from the language of the statute, but also from a 
consideration of the social conditions which gave rise to it and 
of the mischief which it was passed to remedy, and then he 
must supplement the written word so as to give “force and 
life” to the intention of the legislature…. A judge should ask 
himself the question how, if the makers of the Act had 
themselves come across this ruck in the texture of it, they 
would have straightened it out? He must then do as they 
would have done. A judge must not alter the material of 
which the Act is woven, but he can and should iron out the 
creases.” 
 
95. 
 
In another case of Tirath Singh38, the Indian Supreme 
Court quoting a passage from Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 
Twelfth Edition, expressed and recognized it as a well-established rule of 
interpretation. The passage is as follows:- 
 
“Where the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and 
grammatical construction, leads to a manifest contradiction of 
the apparent purpose of the enactment, or to some 
inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or injustice, presumably 
not intended, a construction may be put upon it which 
modifies the meaning of the words and even the structure of 
the sentence.” 
 
96. 
 
Taking heed from above, it is obvious that the need and 
pertinence of a caretaker setup in the Province is but cardinal when the 
elections to the Provincial Assembly are to take place in order to ensure 
and safeguard not only a free, fair, transparent and non-partisan elections 
for the establishment of a representative government but also to ensure 
good governance and smooth functioning of the government in the

interregnum period. As such, interpretation of extant provisions has to be 
done keeping in view the above. 
  
97. 
 
He further emphasized that the principle of “Casus Omissus” 
meaning that cases of omission, that is, an omission in Statute cannot be 
supplied by construction does not stand in the way of this Court which is 
called upon to remedy a mischief in matters of cardinal and urgent public 
interests as held by the Indian Supreme Court in the case of National Taj 
Traders39, in paragraph No. 10 that: 
 
“Two principles of construction-one relating to casus omissus 
and the other in regard to reading the statute as a whole- 
appear to be well settled. In regard to the former the following 
statement of law appears in Maxwell on Interpretation of 
Statues (12th Edn.) at page 33:  
 
In other words, under the first principle a casus omissus 
cannot be supplied by the Court except in the case of clear 
necessity and when reason for it found in the four corners of 
the statute itself but at the same time a casus omissus should 
not be readily inferred and for that purpose all the parts of a 
statute or section must be construed together and every clause 
of a section should be construed with reference to the context 
and other clauses thereof so that the construction to be put on 
a particular provision makes a consistent enactment of the 
whole statute. This would be more so if literal construction of 
a particular clause leads to manifestly absurd or anomalous 
results which could not have been intended by the Legislature. 
"An intention to produce an unreasonable result", said 
Danckwerts L.J. in Artemiou v. Procopiou, "is not to be 
imputed to a statute if there is some other construction 
available". Where to apply words literally would "defeat the 
obvious intention of the legislation and produce a wholly 
unreasonable result" we must "do some violence to the 
words" and so achieve that obvious intention and produce a 
rational construction. (Per Lord Reid in Luke v. I.R.C., 1963 
AC 557 where at p. 577 he also observed: "this is not a new 
problem, though our standard of drafting is such that it rarely 
emerges….”

98. 
 
Thus, where every attempt must be made to preserve the law 
as enacted, the Courts while interpreting the same must not loose sight of 
underlying intent of such a provision of law, especially if it may defeat 
other extant and equally (if not more) pertinent provisions of law, while 
having due regard to the very need and therefore, intent of such a 
legislation. Further, a caretaker government is after all, also a government 
and is obligated to perform certain functions inherent to any government 
within the scope and mandate of Section 230 of the Elections Act. 
99. 
 
Since the State is a continuous entity and does not come to an 
end, its functions too are of permanent nature and cannot be suspended 
during any interregnum period, especially when confronted with a function 
as primary as ensuring ‘food security’. The scope and extent may vary of 
course and the same have been dealt amply within the body of Section 230 
of the Elections Act but the impugned new SOCs and the JVA do not 
constitute any deviation from the said or any other provision of law.  
100.  
Lastly, it was pointed out that during the course of arguments 
on behalf of the Petitioners, an attempt had been made to give an 
impression as if the entire land of the Province had been allocated for CAF 
project at the cost of rights of individuals. This, at the best, is an over 
statement being far-fetched and in complete divorce to the actual facts of 
the matter. In fact, CAF project is being undertaken in furtherance of rights 
of the people of Pakistan qua ‘food security’. Further, apart from the said 
project, there are several ongoing schemes for the consumption and benefit 
of people of Punjab. One such Scheme is the TCLS announced in the year 
2019. Under the TCLS, land has been leased out to eligible individuals as 
per the following statistics up-till now:- 
 
Land leased out within the 
Prohibited Zone: 
26,400 Acres in 4,218 Lots  
Land leased outside the 
Prohibited Zone: 
233,676 Acres in 16,842 Lots 
Total 
land 
leased 
out 
under the said scheme so 
far: 
260,076 Acres in 21,060 Lots

101.  
As evident from above, a total of 21,060 lots have been leased 
out to people under the TCLS and the process is ongoing. Even otherwise, 
apart from the TCLS, there are several other ongoing schemes which are as 
follows: 
- Lease of State land for NGOs / Charitable Institutions. 
 
- Lease of State land under Petrol Pump Scheme. 
 
- Disposal of State land under utilization of Shops (state 
land is disposed of either through lease or sale through 
open auction). 
 
- Exchange of State land in shape of abandoned paths / 
passages and channels. 
 
- Lease of State land in favour of Divisional Public Schools. 
 
- Transfer of State land in favour of Provincial Government 
Departments under extant laws. 
 
- Transfer of State land in favour of Federal Government 
Departments under extant laws. 
 
 
102.  
Mirza Nasar Ahmad, learned Additional Attorney General of 
Pakistan while addressing the constitutional and legal mandate of the 
Pakistan Army submitted that Article 243 of the Constitution deals with 
the establishment of Armed Forces of Pakistan and divides them into three 
separate forces i.e. Army, Navy and Airforce. Article 245 of the 
Constitution deals with duties of Armed Forces in terms of protection of 
the country against external aggression and war and subject to any law, to 
act in aid of civil power. The overall control and command of the Armed 
Forces is with the Federal Government in terms of Article 243 of the 
Constitution. There is, however, nothing in the Constitution or law under 
which limits are placed on the scope of operations of the Pakistan Army 
except that all the acts of the Pakistan Army must be under the supervision 
and control of the Federal Government. In this regard, it may be mentioned 
that the Constitution is not the source of power or authority of the State or 
its institutions but it only regulates and limits powers, functions and

authority of the State and its institutions. In the absence of express or 
implied limitations, the State and its institutions can carry out any function, 
business and project as long as they are not interfering in the lives of third 
parties or persons. Thus, it is explicitly clear that under the Constitution 
and law, there is no limitation on the Pakistan Army to carry out project 
envisaged under the JVA. Further, there is no direction or instruction of 
the Federal Government prohibiting the Pakistan Army to be part of such 
an arrangement.  With reference to requirement of approval of the Federal 
Cabinet by the Pakistan Army or any of its Directorate before entering into 
a contract, such as the JVA, it was stated that the Constitution itself 
recognizes a distinction between contracts executed in exercise of 
executive authority and those which are not in exercise of such authority. 
Added that bare reading of Article 173 of the Constitution shows that 
while contract regarding disposition of property will always be in exercise 
of executive authority but no such restriction is placed on business 
contracts or projects. Reliance was placed on Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya 
Kapur40 case. The Mustafa Impex case (supra) relates to executive 
authority of the Federation which in turn pertains to execution or 
implementation of law and performing such other sovereign functions of 
the State which do not come in the legislative or judicial domain. Any 
project or business that can be performed or carried out by a private person 
or company even if performed by a government will not fall within the 
scope of executive authority and thus, will not be covered by the principles 
settled in the said case. Consequently, no Cabinet approval was required 
for such an act by the Federal Government or any of its institution. 
Needless to state that carrying out a CAF project is not within the scope of 
sovereign functions of the executive.  
103.  
Learned Federal Law Officer also contended that in terms of 
Article 243 of the Constitution read with Section 8(2) of the Army Act, the

Chief of Army Staff (the “COAS”) is the sole commanding officer having 
complete authority over the institution of the Pakistan Army. As such, he 
can either himself or through delegation of powers may authorize any 
officer on his behalf to grant permission for entering into an agreement 
with any government, different departments and public / private bodies or 
companies. In the instant case, the COAS authorized the DGSP on his 
behalf to enter into the JVA with the GOP. Even otherwise, the question 
regarding competence or authority of the person executing the document 
can only be raised by a party to the document and not by the Petitioners. 
Since in the instant case, neither the COAS nor the GOP has raised any 
objection to the authority of the DGSP to execute the JVA, therefore, the 
objection is liable to be discarded.  
104.  
Learned Federal Law Officer also clarified that the Pakistan 
Army is not investing any money in the project from its sources or tax 
payer money, rather, the investment will be made by the local as well as 
international investors and the Pakistan Army would merely facilitate the 
project, to ensure food security. Further, in the light of Clause 5 of the 
JVA, 20% of the total profit shall be used for research and development 
after the approval of Joint Management Board as visualized in the JVA. 
The remaining profit shall be shared equally between the parties. The 
Pakistan Army will re-invest its profit share in CAF for its development on 
international standards and return the fertile and developed land along with 
infrastructure after completion of lease period to the GOP as per objective 
enshrined in Clause 2 of the JVA, that is, the development plan of the 
leased land which includes farming, raising of Livestock, Research and 
Development activities and raising of infrastructure. Differentiating the 
role of Lands Directorate and the DGSP of the Pakistan Army, he clarified 
that Lands Directorate deals with different matters of military lands 
including lands for welfare of Shuhada while the DGSP was established to 
deal with projects of strategic nature having national importance which 
include development of infrastructure and food security. Hence, the

The able assistance of each one of the learned counsels for the 
Petitioners and the Respondents is duly acknowledged and this Court 
expresses its gratitude, accordingly. 
 
V. 
POINTS OF DETERMINATION 
106.  
The rival contentions of the Petitioners and the Respondents 
in the titled and connected Petitions have been considered in the light of 
case law relied upon by them. The following points of determination 
emerge for decision by this Court. 
(i) 
Whether the Petitions are not maintainable as the Petitioners 
lack locus standi to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court and 
the impugned transaction falls within the exclusive policy 
making domain of the GOP? 
(ii) 
Whether the impugned transaction approved by the Caretaker 
Cabinet is within the ambit of Section 230 of the Elections 
Act, particularly in view of previous ‘in principle’ approval 
by the Elected Cabinet? 
(iii) Whether approval of the new SOCs by the Ministerial 
Committee in its meeting dated 14.10.2022 can be presumed 
valid in absence of minutes of the meeting?

FINDINGS 
Objection qua locus standi of the Petitioners 
107.  
There is no cavil to the proposition that in order to invoke the 
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199(1)(a) and (c) of the 
Constitution, the Petitioners are required to cross the caveats of ‘aggrieved 
person’ or ‘locus standi’ and the absence of ‘adequate remedy provided by 
law’. At the same time, Article 199(2) of the Constitution emphasizing the 
importance of fundamental rights provides that subject to the Constitution, 
the right to move a High Court for the enforcement of any of the 
fundamental rights conferred by Chapter I of Part II shall not be abridged.  
Determination of the eligibility of a person to invoke jurisdiction of the 
Court under Article 199 of the Constitution is vested, in the first instance, 
with the Court itself. The rule of locus standi has over the time received 
liberal interpretation and any person or citizen of the State having 
‘sufficient interest’ in the larger public interest has always been entertained 
to maintain his grievance under Article 199 of the Constitution subject to 
satisfying the other requirements of the said Article. The rule is 
discretionary and no hard and fast rule can be laid down with respect to 
determination of locus standi of a person to knock the door of this Court 
under Article 199 of the Constitution. The discretion is exercised on the 
basis of sound and established judicial principles depending on the facts 
and circumstances of each case in the light of nature, substance and gravity 
of the issues raised vis-à-vis their implications upon the rights and interests 
of the people. 
 
108.  
Importantly, when the matter brought to this Court relates to 
breach or enforcement of any of the fundamental rights affecting the 
citizens of the State as a whole including the person who has come forward

to move the Court, the general and traditional rule to question the locus 
standi of such person is relaxed and dispensed with in favour of an 
exceptional rule and procedure available in public interest litigation 
provided it is established that the person approaching the Court is acting 
with bona fide and in all sincerity to protect the collective rights of the 
people. It is well established that the scope and mandate of Article 199 of 
the Constitution is discretionary, extraordinary and equitable. The rights 
accruing to the citizens of the State may be in the nature of their personal 
or collective rights. The initiative may, therefore, come from a concerned 
citizen regarding the enforcement of a collective right of the society, which 
of course, is also his own personal right being a member and part of the 
society. In the instant case, the challenge aims to protect and preserve the 
State property which, in essence, belongs to the people of Pakistan. Surely, 
every citizen has ‘sufficient interest’ to protect and preserve property of 
the State or at least ensure that it is put to use in the best interest of the 
people. The Atta Ullah Khan Malik case (supra) extensively deliberated 
the scope of public interest litigation with reference to public property. It 
was held that any citizen or person has ‘sufficient interest’ and is therefore, 
an ‘aggrieved person’ under Article 199 of the Constitution, if public 
property is being acquired, held, used or disposed of by public 
functionaries in violation of the law since public functionaries as trustees 
of the people cannot have any personal interest in any public property. 
Therefore, if there is any abuse of trust or violation of law, it confers a 
right upon any member of the general public as an ‘aggrieved person’ to 
invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court, subject to fulfilling 
other requirements under Article 199 of the Constitution.  
 
109.  
Extensive case law was cited by the learned counsels 
representing the Petitioners and the Respondents on the question of locus 
standi of the Petitioners which has been sufficiently penned in the earlier

parts of this Judgment relating to their respective contentions. Some other 
important cases41 are also of significance.  
 
110.  
Suffice is to hold that ultimately, the impugned action is 
adjudged on the touchstone of principles of fairness, justness, 
transparency, non-discrimination, reasonableness, diligence, bona fide, due 
process, adherence to constitutional and legal provisions, processes and 
lawful discharge of duties by the functionaries as trustees of public rights 
and property. Measured on the aforesaid yardstick, if the impugned action 
does not sustain, the person approaching the Court crosses the bridge of 
locus standi. The quantum of public State land, sanctioning of the 
impugned transaction by the Caretaker Government and the quest of the 
Pakistan Army to venture into CAF are unusual aspects of this case which 
warrant Judicial Review. The rule of ‘Standing’ is further diluted when 
other Petitions were instituted in which the Petitioners were directly 
affected from the impugned actions of the Respondents. Hence, this Court 
is constrained to hold that objection of the Respondents qua 
maintainability of the titled and connected Writ Petitions with respect to 
locus standi of the Petitioners is without substance and the same is 
overruled.   
 
Objection qua executive exclusivity in policy making 
111.  
The scheme of trichotomy of power envisaged under the 
Constitution distributes core functions between the three organs of the 
State, that is, the Parliament, the Executive and the Judiciary in terms of 
legislation, exercise of executive authority and adjudication of rights and

interests of the people, respectively. The normal rule is that policy making 
being an executive function is not amenable to Judicial Review by the 
Courts unless the policy falls in any of the exceptions to the general rule. 
The exceptions include if a policy is shown to be in violation of 
fundamental rights, inconsistent to constitutional and statutory provisions, 
or demonstrably arbitrary, capricious, mala fide, discriminatory or 
unreasonable opposed to public policy. The challenge to the impugned 
transaction revolved around breach of several fundamental rights including 
non-discrimination, equality before law, due process, right to information 
and protection of public property. Further, serious allegations were raised 
with respect to various aspects of the impugned transaction qua 
inconsistency to constitutional and legal provisions, breach of mandatory 
legal procedures and processes and incapacity of the Respondents to 
undertake and enter into the impugned transaction in terms of express 
constitutional and legal limitations. The challenge extended to arbitrariness 
and unreasonableness of the impugned transaction on the score that it 
infringes all cannons of transparency, openness, non-discrimination, public 
trust by fiduciaries and as such, is opposed to public policy. In such 
circumstances, refusal to exercise the power of Judicial Review with 
respect to the impugned transaction would constitute a breach of 
constitutional duty imposed upon this Court. The Courts in Pakistan as 
ultimate guardian and custodian of the rights and interests of the people 
have always taken cognizance of violations in the disposal and transfer of 
public property in order to protect, preserve and defend the Constitution. It 
is always better if such cognizance is taken at the outset of a contemplated 
transaction as it allows the government to take remedial measures and 
protects the parties from colossal loss and injury. Therefore, the objection 
qua maintainability of the titled and connected Petitions on the score that 
the impugned transaction being a policy decision is not amenable to 
Judicial Review by this Court, is turned down.

Constitutional and legal mandate of the Caretaker Government 
112.  
The concept of ‘caretaker government’ connotes that it is 
installed for an interim or interregnum period when an elected or 
legitimate government is not in place to achieve two-fold objectives, that 
is, to provide continuity to the business of the State and ensure neutrality 
to all political stakeholders who may contest the elections to form a future 
government. ‘Caretaker government’ is defined as a government that is in 
power temporarily until an election is held42. Similarly, another definition 
describes 
‘caretaker 
government’ 
as 
a 
temporary 
government 
commissioned by the Governor General or a State Governor, usually for a 
short period, until a stable government can be formed43. Therefore, it 
follows that a caretaker government is generally established during the 
time of uncertainty when either an elected or legitimate or stable 
government, for any reason, is not in place. By its inherent nature, it is 
temporary in character to be replaced with an elected or legitimate or 
stable government. Thus, it is generally well established that there are 
limitations and restrictions with respect to any caretaker government in 
terms of its powers, functions and duties. Normal rule is that a caretaker 
government limits itself to routine business of the State and in principle, 
must refrain from making policy decisions.  
113.  
The concept of ‘caretaker government’ in Pakistan is rooted 
in Articles 224 and 224-A of the Constitution which entails that upon 
dissolution of the National Assembly or a Provincial Assembly, as the case 
may be, on completion of their term, or in case, they are dissolved earlier 
in accordance with the Constitution, the President or the Governor, as the 
case may be, shall appoint a caretaker Cabinet. The explicit reason of 
installing and providing for a caretaker Cabinet is to fill the vacuum 
created due to absence of an elected government during the limited or 
interregnum period when the National Assembly or any Provincial

Assembly is dissolved due to completion of its term or is earlier dissolved 
in accordance with other provisions of the Constitution. Needless to state, 
that the Constitution does not envisage any period when an elected 
government is not in place in the country or in any Province except due to 
expiry of term or where any of them stand dissolved in accordance with 
the Constitution. Therefore, the ‘caretaker government’ under Articles 224 
and 224-A of the Constitution is meant only for an interregnum period of 
elections in accordance with the Constitution primarily as a neutral set-up 
to the political stakeholders taking part in the elections and to provide for 
continuity to the business of the State during the interregnum period. The 
powers, functions, duties, limitations and restrictions of the ‘caretaker 
government’ are spelled out in Section 230 of the Elections Act which is 
reproduced as under:- 
“Functions of caretaker Government.— (1) A caretaker 
Government shall—  
 
(a)  
perform its functions to attend to day-to-day 
matters which are necessary to run the affairs of 
the Government;  
 
(b) 
assist the Commission to hold elections in 
accordance with law;  
 
(c) 
restrict itself to activities that are of routine, non-
controversial and urgent, in the public interest 
and reversible by the future Government elected 
after the elections; and  
 
(d) 
be impartial to every person and political party. 
 
(2)  
The caretaker Government shall not—  
(a)  
take major policy decisions except on urgent 
matters;  
(b) 
take any decision or make a policy that may have 
effect or pre-empt the exercise of authority by 
the future elected Government;  
 
(c) 
enter into major contract or undertaking if it is 
detrimental to public interest;

and 
 
 (g)

elections. 
  
(3)

other members of a Caretaker Governments shall, within three 
days from the date of assumption of office, submit to the 
Commission a statement of assets and liabilities including 
assets and liabilities of his spouse and dependent children as 
on the preceding 30th day of June on Form B and the 
Commission shall publish the statement of assets and 
liabilities in the official Gazette. 
  
(4) 
In this section, ‘caretaker Government’ means the 
caretaker Federal Government or a caretaker Provincial 
Government.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
114.  
Section 230 of the Elections Act contains both positive and 
negative covenants, the conjunctive reading of which conclusively 
establishes that there are serious limitations and restrictions imposed by 
the Parliament upon the caretaker government in terms of its powers and 
functions. The mandate or scope of a caretaker government is limited to 
perform functions with respect to day-to-day affairs deemed to be 
necessary to run the government which cannot be postponed to a future 
date. It is obligated to assist the Election Commission of Pakistan to hold 
elections in accordance with law. It is equally under a legal duty to 
consciously restrict itself to routine, non-controversial and urgent matters.

Such caveats or principles were introduced to necessarily refrain it from 
taking any action which is not reversible by the future elected government. 
The Parliament in order to ensure that the caretaker government does not 
exceed its scope and mandate put in place an embargo upon the caretaker 
regime not to take major policy decisions except on urgent matters or 
make a policy which would have the effect to pre-empt the exercise of 
authority by the future elected government. The caretaker government is 
also barred from entering into any major contract or undertaking 
detrimental to public interest. The statutory standards have been 
elaborately interpreted in various factual contexts by the Superior Courts 
and some of the observations with respect to the interpretation of Section 
230 of the Elections Act have already been quoted in Part III of this 
Judgment by the Petitioners that need not be reiterated to avoid repetition. 
Section 230 of the Elections Act provides this Court a statutory yardstick 
to opine on any decision, act or action taken by a caretaker government in 
exercise of power of Judicial Review depending upon the facts and 
circumstances of each case. 
115.  
There is no denial of the fact that CAF is a major policy 
initiative. The importance and significance of CAF was pleaded as a long-
term policy response by the Elected Government to the challenge of food 
insecurity. Accordingly, the formation of the policy was triggered by 
moving a summary to the Chief Minister, Punjab on 25.06.2021 initially as 
a part of CPEC. It is apparent that the GOP was considering to open the 
agriculture sector to attract foreign investment in order to bring the barren 
accessible State land under cultivation to enhance agricultural productivity 
and employment with focus on transfer of technology. It may not be out of 
place to mention that concept of Agriculture Promotion Companies was 
also introduced under Section 457 of the Companies Act, 2017 to provide 
for specialized corporate vehicle to facilitate investment in the agriculture 
sector. After passing through governmental procedures, the original SOCs 
were approved by the Elected Cabinet in its 51st meeting held on

28.02.2022. A lease and rental model in conformity with the mandate of 
Section 10 of the Colonization Act was developed. The minimum 
threshold of five hundred Acres with no cap on the upper ceiling and 
minimum lease period of 20 years was fixed with an option of renewal 
subject to certain conditions as an incentive to attract investment. 
Importantly, 100% foreign equity was allowed along with some other 
facilities. Lease was permissible to a company or companies who could 
form a joint venture amongst themselves. One of such companies, as a part 
of joint venture, was obligated to register or incorporate in Pakistan. The 
option of transferring land from government to government was 
recognized. However, conspicuously, only lease through open auction on 
rental basis was visualized. Though there is no specific stipulation to this 
effect yet it is quite apparent from the overall reading of the original SOCs 
that the option of leasing by the GOP to another government was 
incorporated with reference to foreign governments and their entities as the 
major purpose of the initiative was to attract foreign investment and seek 
transfer of technology. Importantly, there was no concept of transfer of 
land on lease to any government or its entity on ‘single source’ and a 
uniform competitive process was stipulated. The Elected Cabinet 
conditionally approved the original SOCs, in principle, by directing to 
place the same before the specifically constituted Ministerial Committee 
consisting of nine members including four Ministers and five bureaucrats.  
116.  
It is noted that the Elected Government was treading upon 
CAF initiative with care, caution and responsibility considering the gravity 
and magnitude of the policy measures. Eight months were taken from the 
date of moving the summary from the Chief Minister, Punjab to its 
conditional approval by the Elected Cabinet. It was still ordered to be 
placed before the Ministerial Committee and had also to be placed before 
the Provisional Assembly for consideration as per the recommendation of 
the Standing Committee. The aforesaid facts clearly signify that matter in 
the opinion of the previous Elected Government was neither a day-to-day

routine affair nor of an urgent nature, rather, was such a major long-term 
policy decision having social and economic impact that it required 
thorough deliberation and consideration before it could be finalized. The 
importance of CAF policy can be judged from the fact that it was a first 
policy of its own kind. All previous policies of the GOP regarding leasing 
land to tenants were for small holdings to alleviate poverty and generate 
livelihood for maximum households. In the CAF Policy, the size of 
holding was to be substantially increased to achieve economy of scale. As 
such, it was a major policy shift from past practices. The lease of a 
minimum period of 20 years with conditional right of renewal was surely 
an irreversible policy decision, for once rights were created in favour of 
lessees, the same could not have been arbitrarily reversed at the whims or 
option of any future government. There is no doubt that the objective of 
securing food security is an important public interest but the same imposes 
a corresponding duty on the public representatives and governmental 
functionaries as fiduciaries to safeguard public interest as custodians of 
public property. The decision of the Caretaker Cabinet to approve the new 
SOCs definitely had the effect to pre-empt the exercise of authority by the 
future elected governments. As such, the act of the Caretaker Government 
to pick the thread from where it had been left by the previous Elected 
Government and proceed further was beyond its scope and mandate in 
terms of Section 230 of the Elections Act and was a blatant attempt to 
encroach upon the domain of the future elected governments.   
Validity of approval of the new SOCs by the Ministerial Committee  
117.  
The case of the Respondents is that the Caretaker Government 
was well within its mandate to approve the new SOCs as the same had 
already been approved ‘in principle’ by the previous Elected Government 
and the former had merely implemented the unfinished task, as such, had 
not taken any new policy decision at all. To examine the contention, the 
alleged meeting of the Ministerial Committee carries utmost importance

for the reason that it was alleged that the original SOCs were thrashed out 
by the Ministerial Committee and duly approved in the form and substance 
of the new SOCs which were later approved by the Caretaker Cabinet and 
as such, the latter was merely implementing an approved initiative which 
fell in the day-to-day routine affairs of the Caretaker Government being an 
urgent measure to ensure food security in public interest.  
118.  
In the original replies filed by the Respondents, there was no 
record of the minutes or proceedings of the Ministerial Committee. 
However, when the Respondents were directed to place the proceedings of 
the Ministerial Committee’s meeting on record, the Respondents failed to 
do so. It was vigorously claimed that such a meeting was indeed held but 
candidly conceded that no minutes with reference to the meeting of the 
Ministerial Committee could be recorded. An attendance sheet pasted in 
the factual part of this Judgment along with file noting was relied upon to 
substantiate the claim. A feeble attempt was made to persuade this Court 
that Secretaries as Departmental Representatives validly represented the 
nominated absentee Ministers which was permissible under the Rules, 
2011 and that the Ministerial Committee had approved the original SOCs 
with certain amendments which were later approved by the Caretaker 
Cabinet.  
119.  
It is noted that Cabinet is empowered under Rule 25(3) of the 
Rules, 2011 to constitute Standing or Special Committees and may assign 
to each a class of cases or a particular case. Unless the Cabinet authorizes 
otherwise, the decisions of a Committee formed by the Cabinet are subject 
to ratification of the Cabinet under Rule 25(2) of the Rules, 2011, thus, 
mandating that after consideration of the matter by the Standing or Special 
Committee, another approval from the Cabinet in the form of ratification is 
warranted even if there are no changes or amendments in the matter under 
consideration by any such Committee. The conjunctive reading of Rule 28 
of the Rules, 2011 ordains that the Secretary is ordinarily required to

attend the Cabinet meeting in the presence of the Minister unless otherwise 
directed. However, the Secretary, in the absence of the Minister, is 
required to invariably attend the meeting of the Cabinet, if an item relating 
to his Department is on the agenda. In the case of absence of the Minister, 
the Secretary can request for postponement of an agenda. When the 
Secretary attends a Cabinet meeting in the absence of the Minister, the 
record of minutes of the meeting regarding relevant items are sent to the 
Secretary, instead of the Minister, on account of absence of the latter so 
that the Secretary attending may point out any mistake or omission.  
 
120.  
The Secretary as administrative head of the Department is 
under the control of his Minister-in-charge and is obliged to work under 
his direction and supervision keeping him informed of all important 
matters, particularly proceedings attended by the Secretary in the absence 
of the Minister. In fact, the Secretary under Rule 10(1)(e) of the Rules, 
2011 is mandatorily required to submit, with the approval of Minister, 
proposals for legislation to the Cabinet. In the instant case, the concerned 
Secretaries attending the Ministerial Committee’s meeting did not take any 
approval of their respective Ministers. Rather, in the absence of minutes, 
there was no question of obtaining any approval. Moreover, the Ministerial 
Committee consisted of specified persons including Ministers and officers 
who could not have been substituted by anyone else except without cause 
which act of absence was subject to mandatory subsequent approval. The 
mere presence of a Minister and the Secretary in a meeting or the 
entitlement of the Secretary to represent the Minister in his absence does 
not mean that the office of Secretary and Minister are synonym or inter-
changeable in performance of their constitutional and legal functions. The 
Rules, 2011 merely allow representation in case of absence for the smooth 
conduct of official business. In any event, the Rules, 2011 framed under 
the Constitution are mandatory procedural stipulations for the conduct of 
official  business  and  do  not  pre-empt  the  specific  constitutional

and legal duties imposed by the Constitution and law upon the holders of 
any constitutional and public office. Therefore, the claim of approval of 
the new SOCs by the Ministerial Committee by substituting or amending 
the original SOCs in the absence of minutes and without three out of four 
Ministers in the absence of their subsequent approval exposes the 
hollowness and callousness of the assertion and illuminates the dangers 
associated to any caretaker regime. The claim is in flagrant and blatant 
disregard of all accepted cannons of transparency and reasonableness even 
decency. Thus, the averment of approval of the new SOCs by the 
Ministerial Committee is, at best, based on a presumption on which the 
entire edifice of legal and executive superstructure in terms of their 
approval by the Caretaker Cabinet, issuance of the impugned Notification, 
execution of the JVA and sanctioning of vesting of some chunks of 
identified land in favour of the Pakistan Army was raised. It is regretted 
that no member of the Caretaker Cabinet questioned the propriety of the 
transaction which was completely based on a presumptive hypothesis. The 
mere fact of non-recording of minutes of the Ministerial Committee was 
enough for any man of ordinary prudence acting with minimum threshold 
of wisdom and reasonableness to raise an objection thereto, especially 
when such record was the bridging trail between the original SOCs and the 
new SOCs. This Court is, therefore, constrained to hold that the claim of 
approval of the new SOCs by the Ministerial Committee vide meeting 
dated 14.10.2022 is a nullity in the eyes of law.   
 
The original SOCs vis-à-vis the new SOCs 
121.  
The new SOCs approved by the Caretaker Cabinet and the 
subsequent incorporation of the same in the impugned Notification under 
Section 10 of the Colonization Act manifestly depicts that there were 
conspicuous and material policy deviations from the original SOCs 
approved by the Elected Cabinet. The objective of CAF initiative was

extended from agricultural sector to the livestock sector. The CAF 
initiative was no longer limited to barren cultivable or accessible land but 
‘State land’ subject to its availability for CAF was defined to mean any 
land owned by the GOP under the administrative control of the Collector 
or in use of any Department of the GOP. The GOP was conferred power to 
establish a Cabinet Committee through a notification for approval of size 
of the lot, schedule and base rent etc. and to take decision regarding export 
of products and by-products, meaning thereby, that a fair amount of 
flexibility was being achieved through delegation of executive authority.  
 
122.  
The concept of ‘lease’ through open auction was no longer, 
the only mode of conferring land since the same was supplemented by 
‘lease through single source’. The introduction of this new facet 
completely and substantively altered the original SOCs. Lease through 
single source was made possible without any auction proceedings in 
favour of the Departments of the Federal or Provincial Governments and 
their attached Departments, semi-attached Departments and institutions or 
companies having sole ownership of the Federal or Provincial 
Governments and foreign governments through their entities. The BOR 
was allowed to submit the case of lease through single source directly to 
the GOP for approval of its terms and conditions including details of the 
State land, a draft joint venture agreement, a draft proposal for the board of 
management for each joint venture with a minimum one-third 
representation from the GOP, net sharing mechanism and modalities and a 
profit share of the GOP which shall not be less than 33% in the proposed 
mechanism. As such, not only Clause 5 of the Notification was a clear 
departure from the original SOCs approved by the Elected Government but 
was also self-contradictory in terms that a profit-sharing mechanism 
cannot be termed as a lease. Hence, a completely new methodology of 
utilizing State land under a joint venture was introduced as a policy 
measure. The option of forming a joint venture under the original SOCs

W. P. No. 28283 / 2023 
W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
was reserved for the participating lessees but here the GOP itself was 
conceived to become a joint venture partner. A ‘joint venture’, in essence, 
is a partnership between two and more entities and is a separate business 
model which cannot be termed as a ‘lease’. It appears that the use of the 
word ‘lease’ was merely used or deliberately inserted due to statutory 
requirement of Section 10 of the Colonization Act which will be discussed 
in later part of this Judgment. Power was also conferred upon the BOR to 
include or exclude any piece of State land being used by any Department 
in the schedule of the new SOCs after approval of the Cabinet Committee 
constituted for this purpose. Therefore, two different models, ‘lease 
through open auction on rental model’ and ‘joint venture on profit-sharing 
model’ were made part of the new SOCs. Moreover, as a policy measure, 
it had the potential to completely exclude public participation giving rise to 
the question as to whether it was detrimental or beneficial to public 
interest.  The policy also had serious financial implications for the GOP 
and the people of the Punjab as the profit-sharing formula is based on a 
presumption that the joint venture model would always be profitable. 
Given the checkered history of ‘State Owned Enterprises’ in our country, 
the claim is highly objectionable and offends public policy for if there are 
losses or no profits, who would be responsible to the people as the 
caretaker Cabinet is not elected by the people and is not accountable to the 
Provincial Assembly. Clause 5(a) of the JVA importantly states that the 
Pakistan Army as lessee shall share the profit after return of its initial 
investment. Needless to state that such initial investment which is also 
unspecified may never be returned.  Importantly, size of the tenancy under 
the original SOCs was fixed for five hundred Acres or above which 
normally signify that except in exceptional cases, the ceiling would be 
adhered to enjoining greater public participation but the new SOCs 
eliminated the threshold of ceiling altogether. The power of resumption 
under Clause 15 of the Notification with respect to the new SOCs 
regarding the leased land was also introduced, in case, the same was

required by a research institute of Agriculture and Livestock Departments 
or for public purpose which also appears to be directly in conflict with the 
initial period of lease of 20 years in terms of Clause 9 thereof since no 
consequences flowing out of such resumption are stipulated in the 
Notification vis-à-vis the corresponding vested right of lease in favour of a 
lessee in terms of the latter’s loss of investment. Therefore, it is safely 
concluded that the new SOCs were drastically and fundamentally distinct 
and different in terms of policy measures in comparison to the original 
SOCs in manifold ramifications, and as such, were beyond the mandate 
and scope of the Caretaker Cabinet. Even otherwise, any change in the 
original SOCs required mandatory approval by an Elected Cabinet before 
the issuance of the impugned Notification in terms of statutory stipulation 
under Section 10 of the Colonization Act and the Mustafa Impex case 
(supra). In fact, even if there had been no change in the original SOCs by 
the Ministerial Committee, the Elected Cabinet was required to 
unconditionally approve or ratify it again since the Elected Cabinet as a 
whole is not bound by any ‘recommendations’ or ‘no recommendations’ of 
the Ministerial Committee and itself holds the final authority regarding 
approval of a proposal in its final and conclusive terms. Therefore, the 
argument that the Caretaker Cabinet was merely implementing an already 
approved CAF initiative of the previously Elected Government in 
furtherance of ‘in principle’ approval of the latter is a mere fantasy. Hence, 
the approval of the new SOCs by the Caretaker Cabinet was unlawful and 
of no legal effect. 
 
Undue haste 
123.  
It is equally disturbing to note the undue haste with which the 
impugned transaction went through different stages of its approval. The 
Pakistan Army as potential lessee directly approached the GOP seeking 
land for CAF through letter dated 08.02.2023 even before the approval of 
the new SOCs by the Caretaker Cabinet and the issuance of the 

110

Notification. The claim of the Pakistan Army having rich experience in 
development of waste barren land was not supported by any empirical or 
statistical data. It was merely a bald claim coupled with a thrust for its self-
acclaimed help and cooperation for CAF initiative. It triggered a swift 
meeting dated 15.02.2023 by the Chief Secretary constituting survey teams 
in compliance of the communicated desire. All the Departments readily 
came on board, the partnership proposal in the nature of joint venture was 
formulated and presented to the Caretaker Cabinet which was duly 
approved. Interestingly, 96,671 Acres of identified State land belonging to 
different Departments of the GOP coupled with commitment for the 
provision of one million Acres of State land in Cholistan was approved. 
The proposed Board of Management for joint venture containing four in-
service ex-officio Army Officers i.e.  Adjutant General, DGSP, Director 
General Lands and Director Lands along with a number of bureaucrats as 
representatives of the GOP was allowed, thereby, completely excluding the 
elected representatives. The sanctioned proposal also carried a 
commitment for other unutilized and undeveloped land which was to be 
identified by the BOR. It was conspicuously stated that the Board of 
Management under the JVA shall approve all the policies for utilization of 
State land including its commercial and research use and that the Board of 
Management may establish companies for running the operations on 
commercial basis. It was clarified that the GOP will provide land as an 
equity investment and the Pakistan Army will make investment on the land 
(preferably). The profit-sharing formula was approved on 50:50 basis after 
excluding 20% profit for research and development work. Importantly, a 
Negotiating Committee was also set-up under the chairmanship of the 
Chief Secretary containing all the bureaucrats which was empowered to 
add or delete land owned by various Departments to the extent of one 
million Acres depending upon the suitability of State land. The 
Negotiating Committee was also given the power to sign Management 
Agreement with the Pakistan Army with mutually negotiated terms and

conditions within the ambit of the new SOCs. The JVA was also approved 
and later executed between the Governor of the Punjab acting through the 
Member Colonies, BOR and the Pakistan Army acting through the DGSP. 
The GOP assumed the responsibility to provide canal water or electricity 
wherever available, construct farm to market roads on mutually agreed 
terms and conditions and seek benefit from various subsidy schemes. A 
District Management Committee was also set-up under the JVA for 
smooth implementation of the project in each District. The Negotiating 
Committee hurriedly convened a meeting on 24.03.2023 and approved the 
transfer of readily available 45,267 Acres of the agricultural State land in 
the use of various Departments out of agreed 96,571 Acres of 
Departmental land as approved by the Caretaker Cabinet. This was 
followed by sanction of the said State land in Districts Sahiwal, Khushab 
and Bhakkar vide letters dated 29.03.2023 in favour of the Pakistan Army 
and the name of Pakistan Army / Ministry of Defence was directed to be 
incorporated as a lessee in the cultivation column of revenue record. Thus, 
the stalled initiative during the period of Elected Government was 
reignited on 08.02.2023 and was completed on 29.03.2023 to the extent of 
45,267 Acres land and CAF as a policy initiative under the complete 
control and hegemony of the GOP and the Pakistan Army was set in 
motion for more than one million Acres of land in complete oblivion and 
exclusion of the future elected governments and elected representatives of 
the people. The undue haste, abhorrent and horrendous fashion with which 
the impugned transaction regarding CAF initiative involving huge 
quantum of public immovable property was approved is extremely 
deplorable and is perhaps unprecedented by any caretaker government 
entailing 
serious 
breaches 
of 
fundamental 
rights, 
transparency, 
reasonableness and openness which is deeply lamented, regretted and 
accordingly, disapproved.

Scope and mandate of Section 10 of the Colonization Act 
124.  
Legal shelter was provided to CAF initiative under the 
Colonization Act, an examination whereof, reveals that it was promulgated 
to make better provision for the colonization and administration of the 
GOP lands in the Punjab. Section 3 of the Colonization Act defines 
‘Tenant’ as any person holding land in a colony as a tenant of the GOP. 
Section 4 of the Colonization Act ordains that the GOP has the power 
through a notification to extend its application to any other land which at 
the time of notification is the property of the GOP. Therefore, the 
Colonization Act has an effective domain to regulate all lands of the GOP, 
subject to control and directions of the latter. The impugned Notification 
providing legal sanction to the transaction was issued under Section 10 of 
the Colonization Act which importantly reads as under:- 
“Issue of statements of conditions of tenancies.– (1) The 
Board of Revenue subject to the general approval of the 
Government may grant land in a colony to any person on such 
conditions as it thinks fit.  
 
(2) The Provincial Government may issue a statement or 
statements of the conditions on which it is willing to grant 
land in a colony to tenants.  
 
(3) Where such statements of conditions have been issued, the 
Collector may, subject to the control of the Board of Revenue, 
allot land to any person, to be held subject to such statement of 
conditions issued under sub-section (2) of this section as the 
Collector may by written order declare to be applicable to case.  
 
(4) No person shall be deemed to be a tenant or to have any 
right or title in the land allotted to him until such a written 
order has been passed and he has taken possession of the land 
with the permission of the Collector. After possession has 
been so taken, the grant shall be held subject to the conditions 
declared applicable thereto.” 
 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
 
 
125.  
It follows that under Section 10(1) of the Colonization Act, 
the legislature delegated the power upon the BOR subject to the approval 
of the GOP to grant land to ‘any person’ on ‘such conditions as it thinks 
fit’. The BOR in exercise of such power was entitled to present a proposal

W. P. No. 28283 / 2023 
W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
to the GOP for grant of land in favour of any person. The proposal was 
subject to the mandatory condition of approval by the GOP which in the 
light of Mustafa Impex case (supra) was required to be extended by the 
Cabinet. This provision is limited to ‘grants’ only and it may be invoked to 
confer land to the Departments or any other person to achieve the public 
purposes as deemed appropriate by the GOP. In contrast, Section 10(2) 
relates to ‘tenants’ and it proclaims that land can be granted to tenants only 
by the GOP itself subject to issuance of a legislative instrument under the 
doctrine of delegated legislation in the nature of SOCs determining the 
terms of grant of land in favour of tenants. Therefore, the scope of Section 
10(2) is limited to grant of land to ‘tenants’. The provision is more 
stringent than mere grant of land under Section 10(1) and allows for 
structured discretion in terms of conditions to ensure equality, non-
discrimination and transparency vis-à-vis the tenants through the SOCs. 
Needless to state that the GOP was directly delegated both executive and 
legislative authority by the Provincial Assembly while promulgating the 
Colonization Act. The exercise of power of subordinated legislation in 
terms of issuance of SOCs to grant land to tenants was required to be 
exercised by the Cabinet in light of Mustafa Impex case (supra). Secondly, 
the power to issue a notification by the GOP was also required to be 
exercised precisely in the manner conferred by law44. Once a valid 
notification is issued, the Collector subject to the control of the BOR may 
allot land to any person with the caveat that land cannot be allotted in 
contravention of SOCs in terms of Section 10(3) of the Colonization Act. 
The Collector may declare in his written order of allotment as to which of 
the terms stipulated in SOCs would apply to the allottee. However, the 
allotment order must be confined to SOCs and anything beyond that would 
be unlawful. The significance of the written order of allotment by the 
Collector is spelled out in Section 10(4) of the Colonization Act which 
                                              
44 Abdur Rehman v. Secretary to the Government of West Pakistan Colony Department 
and others (1980 CLC 1042); and Menghay Khan and others v. Karam Din and others

unequivocally declares that no person is recognized as a tenant or can 
claim any right or title in the allotted land in the absence of written order 
of the Collector and must take possession of allotted land with the 
permission of the Collector. Importantly, the text of Section 10(1), (3) and 
(4) of the Colonization Act uses the word ‘person’, whereas, Sub-section 
(2) thereof employs the word ‘tenants’. Taken as a whole, Section 10(1) & 
(2) of the Colonization Act are mutually exclusive as the former relates to 
‘grants only to any person’, whereas, the latter pertains to ‘grants to 
tenants only’. Section 10(3) & (4) of the Colonization Act are in 
furtherance to the controlling Sub-Section (2) of Section 10 of the 
Colonization Act. The controlling provision limits the power of the GOP 
to grant land to ‘tenants only’ and the furthering provisions spell out the 
methodology of allotment and possession along with attached covenants. 
The intentional use of the word ‘tenant’ in Section 10(2) of the 
Colonization Act is clarified by the legislature by using the term ‘no 
person shall be deemed as a tenant’ employed in Section 10(4) of the 
Colonization Act leaving no doubt that land can only be granted under 
Section 10(2) of the Colonization Act to ‘tenants’ only and ‘person’ in 
terms of Sub-sections (3) & (4) of Section 10 of the Colonization Act is no 
one else but a ‘tenant’. The interpretation is in conformity with the cardinal 
principle of interpretation of Statutes which provides that word or subject 
used in the charging or controlling Section would control the word or 
subject used in the procedural or subservient provisions. 
126.  
Section 11 of the Colonization Act further recognizes the 
‘grant of tenancy’ pursuant to and in accordance with any SOCs and later 
provisions of the Colonization Act deal with various rights and obligations 
of tenancy confirming beyond doubt that the law primarily relates to 
regulation of the GOP lands in terms of grants and tenancy. The exercise 
of power of resumption under Section 24 of the Colonization Act is only 
possible in case of breach of terms of SOCs. Section 30 of the 
Colonization Act recognizes the power of the GOP to confer proprietary

rights and as such, the rights of tenancy can culminate into proprietary 
rights. 
127.  
The first question confronting this Court is that can the 
contemplated transaction under challenge be categorized as tenancy in 
terms of the scheme of law encapsulated in the Colonization Act. In 
dictionary meaning, ‘tenancy’ refers to a legal arrangement in which the 
lessee has a right to use the property owned by someone else in exchange 
for paying rent to its owner. It would be advantageous to reproduce the 
definitions of ‘lease’, ‘rent’, ‘tenant’, ‘tenancy’, ‘joint venture’ and 
‘partnership’ as follows:- 
 “A “lease” of immovable property is a transfer of a right to 
enjoy such property, made for a certain time, express or 
implied, or in perpetuity, in consideration of a price paid or 
promised, or of money, a share of crops, service or any other 
thing of value, to be rendered, periodically or on specified 
occasions to the transferor by the transferee, who accepts the 
transfer on such terms45.” 
 
“Rent” means whatever is payable to a landlord in money, 
kind or service by tenant on account of the use or occupation 
of land held by him; but it shall not include any cess, village 
cess or other contribution or due or any free personal service; 
 
“Tenant” means a person who holds land under another 
person, and is or, but for a special contract, would be liable to 
pay rent for that land to that other person; 
 
“Tenancy” means a parcel of land held by a tenant or landlord 
under one lease or one set of conditions46” 
 
“Joint Venture” means a business undertaking by two or more 
persons engaged in a single defined project. The necessary 
elements are (1) an express or implied agreement; (2) a 
common purpose that the group intends to carry out; (3) 
shared profits and losses; and (4) each member’s equal voice 
in controlling the project47”

“Partnership” is the relation between persons who have 
agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or 
any of them acting for all48. 
 
128.  
It follows that the scope of Section 10(2) of the Colonization 
Act is limited to tenants who become lessee of the GOP under SOCs and 
are obliged to pay rent to the GOP. Partnership and joint venture are 
distinguished from each other in terms that former is an arrangement based 
on profit and loss sharing between two or more persons within one firm, 
whereas, a joint venture is a combination of two or more natural or juristic 
persons, as such, distinct legal entities that seek the development of a 
single enterprise or project for profit, sharing the risks associated with its 
development. As a corporate model, it is generally used between two or 
more entities when they wish to combine such resources which they may 
not possess separately but deem it necessary for the success of the project. 
For example, one party has the required investment while the other 
possesses technology, the combination of which is deemed imperative by 
both the parties. Thus, ‘lease on rent basis’ and ‘joint venture on profit 
sharing basis’ are two separate models, the latter being effectively 
excluded from the purview of Section 10(2) of the Colonization Act. 
 
129 
 
The impugned contemplated transaction is admittedly a joint 
venture between the GOP and the Pakistan Army. It is established on 
record that GOP was willing to grant land as equity and the Pakistan Army 
was willing to develop and make use of it for CAF. The Pakistan Army 
was not under any obligation to pay rent or lease money for the land vested 
in the GOP. Rather, a profit-sharing formula was put in place. The reason 
of the joint venture was cited as special expertise of the Pakistan Army to 
undertake the venture and all the specialized Departments of the GOP 
including Agriculture and Livestock acquiesced to their respective lack of 
capacity and expertise in this regard. The impugned Notification was

admittedly issued under Section 10(2) of the Colonization Act as SOCs for 
grant of State land can only be issued under the said provision. It is quite 
obvious that a joint venture on profit-sharing basis was beyond the scope 
of Section 10(2) of the Colonization Act as its mandate was limited to 
creation of tenancy. However, in order to forcibly bring the transaction 
within the scope of the controlling provision of Section 10(2) of the 
Colonization Act, several provisions were incorporated in the Notification 
forgetting that SOCs cannot travel beyond the scope of the controlling 
provision and the Colonization Act as a whole.  A definition of ‘lessee’ 
was inserted in the new SOCs to include any person to whom State land 
was leased under the new SOCs. This was apparently done to assign a 
nomenclature of ‘lessee’ to the Pakistan Army as a joint venture partner to 
circumvent the limited mandate of Section 10(2) of the Colonization Act. 
Lease through single source was regarded a ‘lease’ under the new SOCs 
yet it was subjected to a profit-sharing formula in contrast to a lease 
through open auction which was based on a rental model. The 
incorporation of two separate models in the new SOCs itself testifies that 
the provisions of the impugned Notification travelled beyond the scope of 
Section 10 of the Colonization Act as the parent Statute. The arrangement 
is thus held ultra vires and unlawful. 
 
Issuance of Notification by the Governor 
130.  
The procedural aspect of the impugned Notification relates to 
its issuance. Its opening part reads as under: 
“In exercise of the powers conferred under section 10 of the 
Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 (V of 
1912), Governor of Punjab is pleased to issue the following 
Statement of the Conditions for lease of specified State land 
for corporate agriculture farming, with immediate effect:”

131.  
In order to address the question, it would be beneficial to 
reproduce Articles 173, 137, 138 and 139 of the Constitution in this 
respect which reads as under: 
“173. (1) The executive authority of the Federation and of a 
Province shall extend, subject to any Act of the appropriate 
Legislature, to the grant, sale, disposition or mortgage of any 
property vested in, and to the purchase or acquisition of 
property on behalf of, the Federal Government or, as the case 
may be, the Provincial Government, and to the making of 
contracts. 
 
(2) 
All property acquired for the purposes of the Federation 
or of a Province shall vest in the Federal Government or, as 
the case may be, in the Provincial Government. 
 
(3) 
All contracts made in the exercise of the executive 
authority of the Federation or of a Province shall be expressed 
to be made in the name of the President or, as the case may 
be, the Governor of the Province, and all such contracts and 
all assurances of property made in the exercise of that 
authority shall be executed on behalf of the President or 
Governor by such persons and in such manner as he may 
direct or authorize. 
 
(4)  
Neither the President, nor the Governor of a Province, 
shall be personally liable in respect of any contract or 
assurance made or executed in the exercise of the executive 
authority of the Federation or, as the case may be, the 
Province, nor shall any person making or executing any such 
contract or assurance on behalf of any of them be personally 
liable in respect thereof. 
 
(5)  
Transfer of land by the Federal Government or a 
Provincial Government shall be regulated by law. 
 
137.  Subject to the Constitution, the executive authority of 
the Province shall extend to the matters with respect to which 
the Provincial Assembly has power to make laws:  
 
Provided that, in any matter with respect to which both 
Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) and the Provincial Assembly of 
a Province have power to make laws, the executive authority 
of the Province shall be subject to, and limited by, the 
executive authority expressly conferred by the Constitution or 
by law made by Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) upon the 
Federal Government or authorities thereof.

138.  On the recommendation of the Provincial Government, 
the Provincial Assembly may by law confer functions upon 
officers or authorities subordinate to the Provincial 
Government. 
 
139. (1) All executive actions of the Provincial Government 
shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the Governor. 
 
(2) 
The Provincial Government shall by rules specify the 
manner in which orders and other instruments made and 
executed in the name of Governor shall be authenticated, and 
the validity of any order or instrument so authenticated shall 
not be questioned in any court on the ground that it was not 
made or executed by the Governor. 
 
(3) 
The Provincial Government shall also make rules for 
the allocation and transaction of its business.” 
 
132.  
It is evident from the above that an act of grant, sale, 
disposition or mortgage of any property in itself is an executive function 
and is included in the executive authority of a Province. However, it is 
importantly subject to the Act of appropriate Legislature as in this case, the 
Colonization Act. Thus, it is pertinent to discover the nature and substance 
of the executive act. As already stated above, the power conferred upon the 
GOP under Section 10(2) of the Colonization Act is in the nature of 
delegated legislation. Any notification to be issued thereunder by the GOP 
is a legislative instrument. The process of issuance of Notification involves 
exercise of partly executive and partly legislative authority. For instance, 
the making of proposal by the BOR, its submission to the Chief Minister, 
Departmental inputs, consideration and approval by the Cabinet are 
executive acts but once the same are concluded, the process of issuance of 
notification under Section 10(2) is a pure legislative act since a notification 
is a legislative instrument falling within the purview of subordinate or 
delegated legislation. Once issued, further executive authority is exercised 
by the functionaries of the GOP as per stipulations listed in such a 
notification. This is precisely what Article 173(1) holds.

133.  
Thus, when the legislature delegated the executive and 
legislative authority under the doctrine of delegated legislation in terms of 
Section 10 of the Colonization Act, the executive authority of exercising 
the grant of lease or for that matter, the legislative authority in terms of 
issuance of any notification would be regulated as per the express terms of 
Section 10 of the Colonization Act. Article 139 of the Constitution further 
ordains that all executive actions of the Provincial Government shall be 
expressed in the name of the Governor in accordance with the Rules, 2011. 
Rule 12(1) of the Rules, 2011 requires that no order shall be issued without 
the approval of the Governor in cases mentioned in Part-A of Third 
Schedule thereof. However, no item therein relates to delegated legislative 
instruments such as the impugned Notification. Rather, the matter squarely 
falls under Rule 14(1) of the Rules, 2011 read with Item No. 19 of Part-A 
of Seventh Schedule thereof being a case pertaining to ‘policy decision’ 
and ‘delegated legislation’ requiring approval of the Chief Minister 
through the Cabinet.  The case was required to be submitted to the 
Governor only for information under Rule 13(4) read with Third Schedule, 
Part B, item No. 3 of the Rules, 2011 which requires that summaries for 
the Cabinet, minutes and decisions of its meetings will be placed before 
the Governor for his information. The administration of the Colonization 
Act fell within the ambit of the Colonies Department of the BOR in terms 
of distribution of business under Rule 3(3) read with Second Schedule of 
the Rules, 2011 and the Notification was required to be issued by the 
Secretary of the Colonies Department on behalf of the GOP. It is noted 
that it is well entrenched in our jurisprudence that when a law requires a 
thing to be done in a particular manner, it should be done in that manner, 
or not done at all. As such, the act of issuance of a notification under 
Section 10(2) of the Colonization Act is not an executive act but a 
legislative act which is required to be issued accordingly. Therefore, the 
impugned Notification was required to be issued by the GOP in exercise of 
powers conferred by the Colonization Act. On the same corollary and

W. P. No. 28283 / 2023 
W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
without prejudice to legal challenges on other grounds, the execution of 
the JVA being an executive act, by the GOP expressed in the name of 
Governor was lawful and that by the Pakistan Army not expressed in the 
name of the President was unlawful. Therefore, the issuance of 
Notification by the Governor was unlawful. Several notifications were 
placed before this Court during the course of arguments under Section 10 
of the Colonization Act which showed that some were issued by the 
Governor while some were issued by the GOP through the Secretary 
Colonies such as notification No. 947-91/3319-CL-(II) dated 17.10.1991. 
The confusion, thus, stands clarified, accordingly.   
 
Constitutional and legal mandate of the Pakistan Army 
134.  
The evolution and development of the institution of ‘State’ is 
perhaps the most acclaimed, celebrated and cherished achievement of 
human race in political and social history. Its premises is rooted in 
dominant human instinct to live an orderly and disciplined life, sine qua 
non, for progress, prosperity and peace of any society. The proclivity to 
dwell together and form associations culminated into tribes and ultimately 
evolved into the State. The history of Western State can be traced in 
ancient Greece. Plato and Aristotle wrote of the polis or city-state, as an 
ideal form of association, in which the whole community's religious, 
cultural, political and economic needs could be satisfied. This city-state, 
characterized primarily by its self-sufficiency, was seen by Aristotle as the 
means of developing morality in human character. The Greek idea 
corresponds more accurately to the modern concept of the nation i.e., a 
population of a fixed area that shares a common language, culture and 
history. Similarly, the Roman res publica, or commonwealth, is akin to the 
modern concept of the State. The res publica was a legal system whose 
jurisdiction extended to all Roman citizens, securing their rights and 
determining their responsibilities. With the fragmentation of the Roman 
system, the question of authority and the need for order and security led to

a long period of struggle between the warring feudal lords of Europe. 
Eventually, the struggle culminated into the establishment of a modern 
State in a form of political association or polity that is distinguished by the 
fact that it is not itself incorporated into any other political association, 
though it may incorporate other associations. The State is, thus a supreme 
corporate entity because it is not incorporated into any other entity, even 
though it might be subordinate to other powers (such as another State or an 
empire). One State is distinguished from another by having its own 
independent structure of political authority and an attachment to separate 
physical territories. The State as a modern political construction which 
emerged in early modern Europe has been replicated in all other parts of 
the world. The most important and distinct aspect of the State that 
separates it from other forms of political associations is its abstract quality 
that it is an overarching and exclusive corporate entity in a defined 
territory on which it exercises internal and external sovereignty with 
respect to a permanent population by establishing a Government having 
the capacity to maintain internal order and enter into relations with other 
sovereign States. The State consists, most broadly, upon the agreement of 
the individuals on the means, whereby, resources are employed in the 
interest of the people to achieve their will and disputes are settled in the 
form of laws.49 In essence, the agreement is a social contract between the 
people backed by their will and sanction.    
 
135.  
Pakistan is a State governed by a written Constitution. It is set 
up as Islamic Republic which envisages a federal structure and trichotomy 
of powers between the Parliament, the Executive and the Judiciary. 
Various institutions are created under the overarching constitutional 
scheme which play a crucial role in the governance of the nation and 
discharge of State obligations, duties, and functions towards the people. It 
is universally accepted that the primary responsibility of any State is to

maintain law and order which falls within the executive organ of the State. 
The State of Pakistan is of no exception. Recognizing the same, the 
preamble of the Constitution unequivocally declares that the territories of 
Pakistan forming the FOP and all its rights on land, sea and air, shall be 
safeguarded. The objective is achieved by exercise of power and authority 
through the chosen representative of the people in accordance with the 
principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice. 
The purpose is to enable the citizens to order and fashion their lives in the 
individual and collective spheres in accordance with their beliefs in a 
manner that guarantees fundamental rights including equality of status, 
opportunity and before law, social, economic and political justice, freedom 
of thought, expression, belief, faith, worship and association subject to law 
and public morality so that the people of Pakistan may prosper amongst 
the nations of the world and make their full contribution towards 
international peace and progress and happiness of humanity. 50 
 
136.  
The institution of the Armed Forces of Pakistan was 
conceived to discharge the pivotal duty of the State in terms of protection 
of its frontiers and its citizens against external aggression and internal 
disturbances which may impair the collective will of the people of Pakistan 
to live an orderly and disciplined life regulated by law. Accordingly, 
Articles 243 to 245 were enacted in the Constitution in the following 
terms:- 
 “243. (1) 
The Federal Government shall have control and 
command of the Armed Forces. 
 
(2) 
Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing 
provision, the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces shall 
vest in the President. 
 
 
 
(3) 
The President shall subject to law, have power—

(a) 
to raise and maintain the Military, Naval and Air 
Forces of Pakistan; and the reserves of such 
Forces; and 
 
 
 
 
(b)  
to grant Commission in such Forces. 
 
(4) 
The President shall, on advice of the Prime Minister, 
appoint— 
 
 
 
 
(a) 
the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee; 
 
 
 
(b) 
the Chief of the Army Staff; 
 
 
 
(c) 
the Chief of the Naval Staff; and 
 
 
 
(d) 
the Chief of the Air Staff, 
 
and shall also determine their salaries and allowances. 
 
244. Every member of the Armed Forces shall make oath in 
the form set out in the Third Schedule. 
 
245. (1) The Armed Forces shall, under the directions of the 
Federal Government defend Pakistan against external 
aggression or threat of war, and, subject to law, act in aid of 
civil power when called upon to do so. 
 
(2) 
The validity of any direction issued by the Federal 
Government under clause (1) shall not be called in question in 
any court.  
 
(3) 
A High Court shall not exercise any jurisdiction under 
Article 199 in relation to any area in which the Armed Forces 
of Pakistan are, for the time being, acting in aid of civil power 
in pursuance of Article 245: Provided that this clause shall not 
be deemed to affect the jurisdiction of the High Court in 
respect of any proceeding pending immediately before the day 
on which the Armed Forces start acting in aid of civil power.  
 
(4) 
Any proceeding in relation to an area referred to in 
clause (3) instituted on or after the day the Armed Forces start 
acting in aid of civil power and pending in any High Court 
shall remain suspended for the period during which the 
Armed Forces are so acting.” 
 
137.  
It is evident from the bare reading of the aforesaid 
constitutional provisions that the institution of the Armed Forces was 
created by the Constitution itself under the control and command of the 
Federal Government. Realizing the importance of the Armed Forces with 
respect to its foremost duty regarding the protection of citizens against

external aggression or internal disturbances, the supreme command was 
vested in the institution of the President who is the symbol of unity of the 
State, although the executive authority of the FOP is exercised through the 
Prime Minister and the Federal Cabinet in terms of Articles 90 and 91 of 
the Constitution. The Armed Forces are divided into three branches, that 
is, the Army, Navy and Air Forces corresponding to the duty of the State 
to protect land, sea and air of Pakistan. Considering the peculiar 
composition of the institution of Armed Forces, it is required by the 
Constitution that each and every member of the Armed Forces shall make 
an oath swearing faith and allegiance to Pakistan, to uphold the 
Constitution embodying the will of the people, to refrain from engaging in 
any political activities, whatsoever and honestly and faithfully serve 
Pakistan as required by and under the law. Article 245 of the Constitution 
without doubt clarifies that the Armed Forces shall defend Pakistan against 
external aggression and threat of war under the directions of the Federal 
Government and can only act in aid of civil power when called upon to do 
so subject to law. Thus, it is manifestly clear that the Constitution 
emphasizes that the Armed Forces are always subject to the Constitution 
and law and directions of the Federal Government. 
  
138.  
The Army Act has been promulgated for the effective 
operation and functioning of the Pakistan Army and is employed to run the 
institution. There is no provision therein which allows the Pakistan Army 
to undertake any function beyond the prescribed constitutional mandate in 
Article 245 of the Constitution. Thus, there is not a single act beyond the 
internal functioning of the institution which can be undertaken by the 
Armed Forces on their own without the directions or approval of the 
Federal Government or the command of law. As is customary with every 
military of the world, Article 260 of the Constitution while defining 
“members of the Armed Forces” states that the term does not include 
persons who are not, for the time being, subject to any law relating to the 

126

W. P. No. 28283 / 2023 
W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
members of the Armed Forces. Hence, the pride of any member of the 
Armed Forces is that as a member thereof, such person is under the law 
regulating the particular branch of the Armed Forces and in terms of his 
functions, is not subjected to ordinary law of the land which is applicable 
to the civilian population. The rationale of the aforesaid dictate is rooted in 
the cardinal principle that the Armed Forces being a disciplined and armed 
force in terms of its peculiar duties must be effectively separated from the 
civilian functioning of the State. Therefore, the members of the Armed 
Forces as a principle should not be assigned any permanent civilian role 
which allows their interaction with the civilian population or with the civil 
administration of the State to avoid disputes and differences which are 
inherent in any civilian disposition so that each member of the Armed 
Forces can function beyond political divide and perform his duties in a 
neutral and non-partisan manner. Such is the importance of this rule that 
Article 245(3) of the Constitution even ousts the jurisdiction of the High 
Court under Article 199 of the Constitution in relation to any area in which 
the Armed Forces of Pakistan, for the time being, are acting in aid of civil 
power in pursuance of Article 245 of the Constitution. Similarly, Article 
199 of the Constitution which provides constitutional remedy to the 
citizens of Pakistan for the enforcement of their fundamental rights also 
ordains in sub-Article (3) thereof, that the High Court shall not make an 
order under sub-Article (1) thereof, on application made by or in relation 
to a person who is a member of Armed Forces of Pakistan or who is for the 
time being subject to any law relating to any of those Forces, in respect of 
his terms and conditions of service, in respect of any matter arising out of 
his service, or in respect of any action taken in relation to him as a member 
of the Armed Forces of Pakistan or a person subject to such law. The 
above articulation postulates that the institution of Armed Forces of 
Pakistan as an institution of the State is to be kept in segregation or 
oblivion to all other civil institutions of the State so that it can focus upon 
its primary responsibility of defending Pakistan and protecting its people

without being involved in any kind of political, social or economic divide 
which may erode its professional capability, neutrality, prestige and pride. 
139.  
The scope and mandate of the Armed Forces of Pakistan have 
been exquisitely interpreted in the cases of Sindh High Court Bar 
Association; Air Marshal (Retd.) Muhammad Asghar Khan; and Prof. 
Zahid Baig Mirza (supra) which are extensively quoted in Part-III of this 
Judgment under the head ‘contentions of the Petitioners’ and need not be 
reiterated for the sake of brevity. Suffice is to reiterate that it has been 
rightly concluded therein that any action of the Armed Forces undertaken 
without the direction or approval by the Federal Government shall always 
be unlawful, unconstitutional, void ab initio and consequently, of no legal 
effect. It has also been aptly determined that the Armed Forces fall under 
the control of the Ministry of Defence. Various Directorates have been set 
up by the General Headquarters of the Pakistan Army for its internal 
functions. The Directorate or Department dealing with lands has a 
restricted mandate with respect to land allocated for the use of branches of 
Armed Forces or the Pakistan Army in order to manage and retain it 
according to the scheme of governing law. The administration of military 
lands and cantonments group is also under the administrative control of the 
Ministry of Defence. Therefore, it is evident from record that the venture 
to adventure into CAF initiative by the DGSP was not approved by the 
Federal Government as admittedly no approval of the Federal Cabinet as 
per the mandate of Mustafa Impex case was placed on record. Although, 
there is also no approval of the COAS authorizing the DGSP to undertake 
CAF initiative yet during arguments it was claimed that the DGSP acted 
under the approval of CAF initiative by the COAS. It is safely concluded 
that even if there is any such approval, the same without the approval of 
the Federal Government was unconstitutional and unlawful.  
 
140.  
The Respondents by conceding that no approval of Federal 
Government was obtained submitted that CAF initiative being a

W. P. No. 28283 / 2023 
W. P. No. 23256 / 2023 
 
commercial venture did not require approval of the Federal Government. 
As already discussed above that the Pakistan Army cannot do anything of 
its own, it is held that the restricted mandate of the Pakistan Army in terms 
of Article 245 of the Constitution is comprehensive and extends to every 
function of the Pakistan Army and includes all commercial activities. The 
Pakistan Army is funded out of public money through budgetary 
allocation. Learned Additional Attorney General when confronted that 
how the Pakistan Army undertook to make investment in the CAF 
initiative as it is not a profit earning institution, submitted that investment 
was to be received through local and foreign partners and the Pakistan 
Army was to facilitate such investment for CAF. Again, even the quest for 
such a role is unlawful and beyond comprehension. Therefore, the 
contention that CAF initiative being a commercial contract did not require 
the approval of the Federal Government is misconceived being in flagrant 
disregard of Article 245 of the Constitution and the holding of the Apex 
Court to the effect that the Armed Forces cannot do anything of  their own 
without the approval or direction of the Federal Government. 
    
141.  
The argument of learned Additional Attorney General that the 
scheme may be construed in terms of Article 147 of the Constitution which 
empowers the GOP with the consent of the Federal Government to entrust, 
either conditionally or unconditionally, to the Federal Government, or to 
its officers, functions in relation to any matter to which the executive 
authority of the Province extends provided that the Provincial Government 
shall get the function so entrusted ratified by the Provincial Assembly 
within 60 days, is inherently flawed and misconceived. This is for the 
reasons that neither any request of the GOP or the consent of the Federal 
Government is on record and more so, the Provincial Government is not in 
existence to ratify the same.  This is notwithstanding that such entrustment 
with respect to CAF initiative would also be in breach of the restricted

mandate of the Caretaker Government in terms of Section 230 of the 
Elections Act as well as the mandate of the Pakistan Army.  
 
142.  
It is universally established and accepted principle that no 
institution can operate or perform any function beyond the express 
mandate conferred by the Constitution or law and the moment it steps 
outside its given mandate, its operation or performance of that function 
would be unconstitutional or unlawful. Of course, the Pakistan Army is of 
no exception. The institution of the Armed Forces of Pakistan was 
established with a clear, restricted and limited mandate. In the modern 
world, a credible institution takes pride in its excellence in terms of its 
specialized knowledge, training, expertise and achievements in the field of 
its activity or defined ambit vis-à-vis other competing institutions within 
the same field. Conversely, it negatively and adversely reflects upon the 
reputation and professionalism of an institution that in oblivion to its duties 
endeavours to assume role assigned to other institutions. The seldom 
departure by the Pakistan Army may occasion in the peculiar context of 
history marred with military interventions that blurred the conceived 
segregation of the Armed Forces from civilian administration of the State. 
The interference into civilian realm, is therefore, liable to be rectified by 
the Armed Forces through conscious steps for unwanted historical chapters 
can be set at naught through affirmative and positive acts of the present 
and future. The real purpose of Judicial Review by the Courts is not 
limited to examine the impugned transaction but it affords an opportunity 
to every institution or functionary whose acts and actions are under 
scrutiny to redress its transgressions through effective steps and reforms to 
ensure that such violations are prevented in future leading to an 
illuminated way forward in conformity with the Constitution and law. The 
people of Pakistan have the foremost right to expect and demand that the 
Armed Forces being the foremost institution for the protection of their life, 
liberty and property may rise to the occasion and be regarded as the most 
professional, focused and respected militaries of the world. The objective

can only be achieved by strict adherence to its constitutional role. The act 
of the GOP and the DGSP to undertake CAF initiative under a joint 
venture being beyond the constitutional mandate of the Pakistan Army is, 
accordingly, held as unconstitutional and unlawful. 
VII 
CONCLUSION 
143.  
The constitutional scheme imposes an obligation on the State 
to ensure the elimination of all forms of exploitation and the gradual 
fulfillment of the fundamental principles, from each according to his 
ability to each according to his work. The Constitution guarantees that 
every person shall have the right to be treated in accordance with law and 
no action shall be taken which is detrimental to the life, liberty, body, 
reputation or the property of any person except in accordance with law. 
The State comprises of the Federal Government, the Parliament, a 
Provincial Government, Provincial Assembly and such local or other 
authorities in Pakistan as are by law empowered to impose any tax or 
cess.51 The Constitution confers a number of important fundamental rights 
upon the people including the right of every citizen to acquire, hold or 
dispose of the property subject to the Constitution and any reasonable 
restrictions imposed by law in the public interest.52 All State resources 
including immovable property vested in the State belong to the people of 
Pakistan. The Government and its functionaries are custodians of the State 
property and are accountable to the people through their chosen 
representatives. There are corresponding obligations upon them to be 
always loyal to the Constitution and in turn, the people of Pakistan and as 
trustees and fiduciaries, to always hold and dispose of property in 
accordance with dictates of the Constitution and law. Chapter 2 of Part-II 
of the Constitution enunciates the directive Principles of Policy and 
declares that it is the responsibility of each organ and authority of the State 
and of each person performing functions on behalf of an organ or authority

of the State, to act in accordance with those principles in so far as they

the affairs of the Federation and the Governor of each Province in relation 
to the affairs of the Province is obligated to get a report prepared and lay it 
before each House of the Parliament or as the case may be, the Provincial 
Assembly, regarding implementation and observance on the Principles of 
Policy.53 
144.  
Importantly, Article 37(f) of the Constitution obligates the 
State to enable the people of different areas through education, training, 
agriculture and industrial development and other methods to participate 
fully in all forms of national activities including employment in the service 
of Pakistan. Similarly, Article 38 of the Constitution requires that the State 
shall endeavour to secure the well-being of the people, irrespective of sex, 
caste, creed or race by raising their standard of living, preventing the 
concentration of wealth and means of production and distribution in the 
hands of a few to the detriment of general interest and by ensuring 
equitable adjustment of rights between employers and employees and 
landlords and tenants. The State is equally under a duty to distribute the 
available resources in a manner that generates livelihood so that the 
citizens can have access to the necessities of life such as food, clothing, 
housing, education and medical facilities. The underlying principle is to 
reduce disparity in the income and earning of its citizens.54

145.  
It, therefore, follows that the directive Principles of Policy 
unequivocally expect the governments in the country to frame policies 
keeping in view the underlying objectives. The impugned policy of CAF is 
inherently in violation of the guiding principles listed above for the reason 
that State land comprising more than one million Acres was reserved for 
one particular entity, thereby, concentrating holding in one hand, whereas,

it is possible and equitable to frame a policy that calls for inclusion of 
maximum number of persons to ensure that they may earn their livelihood 
by taking State land on lease. Further, through the impugned policy, the 
cultivators of State land would become employees instead of being direct 
lessees which shall reduce their earnings and means of livelihood. The 
objective of CAF initiative can be well achieved by fixing a ceiling and 
making a transparent competitive policy so that State land could be 
divested as lease to maximum beneficiaries who may get benefit from 
transfer of technology and collaborate with foreign entities willing to 
invest in the sector. This was precisely the model which was being 
considered by the previous Elected Government. An equally important 
policy consideration is that State property may be disposed of in a manner 
that fetches maximum return to the State because in the last resort the 
property belongs to the nation as a whole and not to a few beneficiaries of 
a particular scheme. In this context, the Superior Courts have repeatedly 
emphasized competitive, published, open and transparent processes to 
fetch maximum price. The profit-sharing model envisaged by the 
Caretaker Cabinet with inherent risk of loss is against such dictates.   
Therefore, the impugned policy does not adhere to the guiding Principles 
of Policy enshrined in the Constitution. It is also noted that on account of 
various economic, social and cultural aspects of the policy, it was aptly 
and rightly recommended by the Standing Committee that it may be 
considered by the Provincial Assembly. 
146.  
In view of the foregoing, it is safely concluded that the 
Caretaker Cabinet manifestly acted beyond its legal mandate under a 
misconceived notion that it was merely completing the legal process 
regarding an already approved CAF initiative by the previous Elected 
Cabinet. In the process, the GOP committed serious and flagrant breaches 
of substantive law and legal processes leading to introduction of the new 
SOCs which were materially and substantially different from the original 
SOCs approved by the previous Elected Cabinet. The permission to grant

land under CAF initiative under ‘single source lease’, opened a door for 
conferring State land in a non-transparent, non-competitive, arbitrary and 
unreasonable manner, offending the directive Principles of Policy and 
infringed the fundamental rights of the people to life, dignity, equality, due 
process and property enshrined in the Constitution. It is, therefore, ordered 
as follows:- 
I. 
For the reasons recorded as aforesaid, the titled and connected 
Petitions are allowed;  
II. 
The impugned transaction consisting of the decisions taken 
and approval accorded to the new SOCs in the Ministerial 
Committee’s Meeting dated 14.10.2022, the 4th meeting of 
Caretaker Cabinet on Agenda No. 3 dated 09.02.2023, the 
Notification dated 20.02.2023 issued under Section 10 of the 
Colonization Act, the 7th meeting of Caretaker Cabinet on 
Agenda No. 3 dated 25.02.2023, the JVA dated  08.03.2023 
and all subsequent developments including the sanction or 
transfer of State land in favour of the Pakistan Army are 
declared unlawful and of no legal effect and are set aside, 
accordingly. Resultantly, all State land shall stand reverted to 
the GOP, the Departments and persons as per its previous 
status. The SMBR is directed to ensure compliance by 
amending the revenue record, if required, and submit 
compliance report to the Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of this 
Court within fifteen days from the date of this Judgment. 
III. 
It is declared that the Caretaker Government lacks 
constitutional and legal mandate to take any decision 
regarding CAF initiative and policy in any manner 
whatsoever, in terms of Section 230 of the Elections Act; 
IV. 
It is directed that the future elected government may resume 
the CAF initiative after the stage of its conditional approval

by the previous Elected Cabinet in its 51st meeting dated 
28.02.2022 and proceed in accordance with law;  
V. 
It is declared that the Armed Forces including the Pakistan 
Army and / or its subordinate or attached Departments / 
offices lack constitutional and legal mandate to indulge and 
participate in CAF initiative and policy in terms of Article

It is directed that office shall transmit certified copy of this 
Judgment to the Federal Government through Secretary 
Cabinet Division; Secretary, Ministry of Defence; the 
Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee; the COAS; the 
Chief of the Naval Staff; and the Chief of the Air Staff. It is 
expected that the FOP in concert with the afore-mentioned 
officers will evaluate all activities and projects of the Armed 
Forces and if required, take appropriate and necessary 
remedial steps to ensure that they are in conformity with the 
constitutional and legal mandate of the Armed Forces. 
Further, necessary steps will also be taken to sensitize each 
member of the Armed Forces regarding the constitutional and 
legal mandate of the Armed Forces in the light of prescribed 
Oath in the Constitution and consequences arising from 
possible violations thereof, under the Constitution and law.
