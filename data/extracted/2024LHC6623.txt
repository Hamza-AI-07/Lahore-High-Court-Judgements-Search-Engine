3. 
 
After registration of the case, the Investigating Officer conducted 
the investigation and recorded the statements of the prosecution witnesses 
under Section 161 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 („hereinafter the 
Code‟). During the course of the investigation, having found the appellant 
involved in the crime in question, the Investigating Officer prepared the 
report under Section 173 of the Code while placing his name in column No.3 
and submitted it before the trial court through the concerned prosecutor. 
4. 
 
The appellant was formally indicted to which he pleaded not 
guilty and claimed trial. To substantiate its version, the prosecution produced 
as many as four (4) prosecution witnesses. After the completion of the 
prosecution evidence, the statement of the appellant, as envisaged under 
Section 342 of the Code, was recorded by the trial court. The appellant 
professed his innocence and pleaded false implication in the case. Upon 
completion of the trial, the trial court found the case against the appellant 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt, leading to his conviction and sentence as 
detailed above. 
5. 
 
We have heard the arguments and perused the record. 
6. 
 
The crux of the arguments presented by the learned counsel for 
the appellant revolves around a fundamental procedural flaw. He submits that 
during the appellant‟s examination under Section 342 of the Code, he was not 
confronted with the full extent of the incriminating evidence and 

Crl. Appeal No.24404/2019 
 
(3) 
circumstances upon which his conviction was ultimately based. This 
omission, as counsel contends, constitutes a serious breach of the appellant‟s 
right to a fair trial, as it deprived him of the opportunity to effectively 
challenge or explain the incriminatory evidence used against him.  
7. 
 
Before we delve into the merits of the contention of learned 
counsel regarding the appellant‟s examination under Section 342 of the Code, 
it is fitting first to examine the sphere of this legal provision. A clear 
understanding of the scope and purpose of Section 342 of the Code is 
essential to properly assess whether the mandatory procedural requirements 
have been adhered to and whether the appellant‟s rights have been duly 
safeguarded. It would be appropriate to reproduce Section 342 of the Code to 
facilitate a clearer and more comprehensive understanding: - 
“342. Power to examine the accused: (1) For the purpose of enabling the accused to explain any 
circumstances appearing in the evidence against him, the Court may, at any stage of any inquiry or 
trial without previously warning the accused, put such questions to him as the Court considers 
necessary, and shall, for the purpose aforesaid, question him generally on the case after the 
witnesses for the prosecution have been examined and before he is called on for his defence. 
(2) The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing to answer such questions, 
or by giving false answers to them; but the Court may draw such inference from such refusal or 
answers as it thinks just.  
(3) The answers given by the accused may be taken into consideration in such inquiry or trial, and 
put in evidence for or against him in any other inquiry into or trial for, any other offence which such 
answers may tend to show he has committed.  
 (4) Except as provided by sub-section (2) of section 340, no oath shall be administered to the 
accused.” 
The purpose of examining an accused under Section 342 of the Code is 
clearly articulated within the provision itself. It lays down the purpose as to 
“enable the accused to explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence 
against him.” Section 342 of the Code directly correlates with the principle of 
audi alteram partem, one of the foundational principles of natural justice. The 
term “audi alteram partem” translates to “hear the other side” or “let no 
person be condemned unheard”. This principle safeguards the fundamental 
right that no individual shall face punishment or adverse judgment without 
being afforded a fair opportunity to present his case and challenge the 
evidence laid against him. This examination serves as a crucial safeguard, 

Crl. Appeal No.24404/2019 
 
(4) 
allowing the accused a direct opportunity to confront and clarify any 
incriminating material and circumstances that have emerged during the trial. 
It offers an accused a vital opportunity to present his defense, ensuring that no 
adverse conclusions are drawn without first considering his perspective. This 
reflects the very essence of justice and fairness, safeguarding the rights of the 
accused and upholding the integrity of the judicial process. 
8. 
 
Under Section 342 of the Code, there are two distinct forms of 
examination. The first may occur at any stage during the inquiry or trial and is 
discretionary in nature. To allow the accused to explain any incriminating 
circumstances arising from the evidence, the court may, at any stage of an 
inquiry or trial and without prior notice, pose questions it deems necessary. It 
is particular and optional, giving the court the flexibility to engage with the 
accused when specific issues arise, and clarification is required. In contrast, 
the second form of examination is conducted after the prosecution witnesses 
have been examined but before the accused is called upon to present his 
defense. This examination is general and mandatory, requiring the trial court 
to give the accused a formal opportunity to explain the entirety of the 
incriminating evidence presented against him. It ensures that the accused is 
fully aware of the case he must meet and provides a critical opportunity for 
him to offer any explanations or rebuttals before the defense is presented. 
Section 342 of the Code safeguards the rights of the accused and upholds the 
integrity of justice, ensuring that it is administered through a fair trial, as 
guaranteed under Article 10-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973. 
9. 
 
Recording the statement of the accused under this provision is far 
from a mere formality. It is a critical safeguard ensuring that no conviction is 
handed down without the accused being fully aware of, and responding to, 
every aspect of the evidence against him. Section 342 of the Code imposes a 
solemn and unyielding duty upon the trial court, in the course of a trial, to 
pose direct and precise questions to the accused, ensuring he is given every 
opportunity to explain all circumstances arising from the evidence against 

Crl. Appeal No.24404/2019 
 
(5) 
him. It follows as an unassailable principle that every material circumstance 
presented in the prosecution evidence must be put to the accused with clarity, 
precision, and distinctly. The inability to do so undermines the core principles 
of judicial fairness and integrity. Such a lapse is not merely a procedural 
defect, rather, it is a fatal flaw that leaves the prosecution‟s case hollow, with 
no outcome but the acquittal of the accused. Injustice cannot stand where due 
process has been so egregiously overlooked. The law is now firmly settled 
that if a piece of incriminating evidence or a circumstance is not brought to 
the attention of the accused during his examination under Section 342 of the 
Code, such evidence or circumstance cannot be relied upon to secure his 
conviction. It‟s a core principle of criminal jurisprudence that no one should 
be condemned based on evidence he has not had the chance to confront or 
challenge. To act otherwise would be turning a fair trial into a hollow 
process.1 
10. 
 
To thoroughly evaluate the argument advanced by the learned 
counsel for the appellant, we have undertaken a careful and meticulous 
perusal of the entire body of evidence available on the record. Upon such 
scrutiny, it becomes evident that the prosecution‟s narrative regarding the 
recovery of the narcotic substance, the separation of the sample parcel, its 
deposit with the station clerk, and its subsequent transmission to the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (PFSA), has been both comprehensively and 
convincingly substantiated. However, close and careful scrutiny of the 
appellant‟s statement recorded under Section 342 of the Code reveals that the 
appellant was not confronted with the fact that a sample had been separated 
from the bulk quantity of narcotic recovered, sealed into a parcel, nor with the 
fact that it was sent to the police station for storage in the storeroom. 
Furthermore, the appellant was not confronted with the vital details 
concerning the exact date on which the parcel was dispatched to the forensic

lab, nor was he put the identity of the witness who carried and deposited the 
parcel there.  
Thus, the appellant was not duly confronted with the chain of safe 
custody. In our criminal jurisprudence governing narcotic cases, maintaining 
an unbroken chain of safe custody is the backbone of proving a case against 
the accused. Without this chain intact, the case risks falling apart at the seams, 
as the integrity of the evidence stands in question. If the accused has not been 
duly confronted with the chain of safe custody while examining him under 
Section 342 of the Code, the same cannot be wielded to secure his conviction. 
11. 
 
We are unequivocally convinced that it was the prosecution‟s 
duty to establish an unbroken chain of custody with clear and compelling 
evidence, leaving no room for doubt, and equally crucial was the obligation of 
the trial court to confront the appellant with the same during his examination 
under Section 342 of the Code. The trial court‟s handling of this crucial step 
leaves much to be desired. To say the least, it was perfunctory, cursory, 
superficial, and fell woefully short of the requisite standard as mandated by 
Section 342 of the Code. Without confronting the appellant with this crucial 
piece of incriminating evidence, i.e. the chain of safe custody, the foundation 
of the case collapses, leaving no choice but to acquit him. 
12. 
 
In light of the foregoing discussion, the appellant is hereby 
acquitted of the charge. Allowing the instant appeal, his conviction and 
sentence are set aside. The appellant has appeared before the Court in 
compliance with the bailable arrest warrant issued on 15.05.2023, which is 
ordered to be withdrawn. The surety of the appellant is hereby discharged 
from liability.
