Mr. Shahbaz Butt, learned Advocate for the 
applicant. 
Mr. Tabassam Ali, learned Legal Advisor for the 
respondent-department.  
 
By way of this single order we intend to 
decide the titled reference-application as well as 
I.T.R. No. 53180 of 2024, being outcome of same 
impugned order. 
2.  
Through these reference-applications 
filed under section 133(1) of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 (the ‘Ordinance’) the applicant 
has requested to answer the following question 
arising out of order dated 24.06.2024 passed by the 
learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, 
Lahore (the “Tribunal”):- 
 
“Whether on the facts and in the 
circumstances of the case, the Appellate 
Tribunal has failed to pass a reasoned, 
just, fair proper, plausible and speaking 
order as required under section 24A of 
the General Clauses Act, 1897?” 
 
3.      
Mr. Shahbaz Butt-learned counsel for 
the applicant has submitted that the learned 
Tribunal while dismissing the appeals has not 
addressed the questions of law and facts put-forth 
by the applicant. Learned counsel for the applicant 

I.T.R. No. 53185-2024 
I.T.R. No. 53180-2024 
 
2 
 
has relied upon section 24A of the General Clauses 
Act, 1897 (the ‘Act’) and stated that power to make 
any order conferring upon any authority, officer or 
person has to be exercised justly and for 
advancement of the purposes of the relevant 
enactment; that it is incumbent upon any officer or 
authority to give reasons for reaching to the 
conclusion.  
4.  
Mr. Tabassam Ali-learned counsel for 
the 
respondent-department 
has 
vehemently 
opposed this reference-application and he has 
stated that the question reproduced above is not 
arising out of the order of the learned Tribunal. 
5.  
Heard. 
6.  
Record reflects that the applicant raised 
several questions, factual and legal, before the 
learned Tribunal, however, in paragraphs No. 1 to 
6 of order dated 24.06.2024 merely the arguments 
of the two sides and the orders passed by the fora 
below have been reproduced and then the appeals 
have been rejected without giving any reasoning. 
The relevant and operative part reads as follows:- 
“…However keeping in view the grounds of 
appeals and the facts and circumstances of 
these appeals we observed that the learned 
counsel for the taxpayer has failed to point out 
any legal or factual infirmity in the impugned 
appellate orders and has not put forth any 
documentary or material evidence to rebut the 
observations and findings of the learned 
CIR(A)…”  
 
7.  
The proposition of law is well settled 
that judicial or quasi-judicial forums should record 
reasons for their conclusions and decide the 
matters through speaking judgments and / or 

I.T.R. No. 53185-2024 
I.T.R. No. 53180-2024 
 
3 
 
orders. This is to enable the aggrieved parties to set 
up their appeals, applications or petitions as well as 
enabling the higher Courts to exercise their 
jurisdiction properly and to appreciate the 
controversies in correct perspective. In case titled 
“Muhammad Iqbal Chaudhary and another vs. 
Secretary, Ministry of Industries and Production, 
Government of Pakistan and others” (PLD 2004 
SC 413), the Supreme Court of Pakistan while 
setting aside the order assailed therein, remanded 
the case for decision afresh and observed as 
follows:- 
“3. It may be noted that the forums seized 
with the judicial matters are required to 
pass such a speaking judgment that it 
should give an impression to readers that 
the legal and factual aspects of the case 
which were raised before it for the purpose 
of decision have been considered and 
decided in the light of recognized principles 
of law on the subject instead of disposing of 
in slipshod manner.” 
 
Similar question was taken up by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case titled “Muhammad Amin 
Muhammad Bashir Limited vs. Government of 
Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Finance, 
Central Secretariat, Islamabad and others” (2015 
SCMR 630), wherein, a case arising out of a 
decision passed by the Federal Board of Revenue 
was found devoid of reasoning that also resulted 
into an order of remand and Supreme Court 
observed:- 
“…The legislature, when it confers a wide 
ranging power, must be deemed to have 
assumed that the power will be, firstly, 
exercised in good faith, secondly, for the 

I.T.R. No. 53185-2024 
I.T.R. No. 53180-2024 
 
4 
 
advancement 
of 
the 
objects 
of 
the 
legislation, and, thirdly in a reasonable 
manner. Section 24A of the General 
Clauses Act, 1897, reiterates the principle 
that statutory power is to be exercised 
"reasonably, fairly, justly and for the 
advancement of the purposes of the 
enactment" and further clarifies that an 
executive authority must give reasons for 
its decision. Any action by an executive 
authority which is violative of these 
principles is liable to be struck down. No 
other view is permissible. 
10. In the well known case of "Amanulla 
Khan 
and 
others 
v. 
The 
Federal 
Government 
of 
Pakistan 
through 
Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Islamabad 
and others (PLD 1990 SC 1092) this Court 
laid down the principle of sinictured 
discretion. 
"Wherever 
wide-worded 
powers 
conferring discretion exist, there remains 
always the need to structure the discretion 
and it has been pointed out in the 
Administrative Law Tax by Kenneth Culp 
Davis (page 94) that the structuring of 
discretion only means regularizing it, 
organizing it, producing order in it so that 
decision will achieve the high quality of 
justice. The seven instruments that are 
most 
useful 
in 
the 
structuring 
of 
discretionary power are open plans, open 
policy 
statements, 
open 
rules, 
open 
findings, open reasons, open precedents 
and fair informal procedure. 
Somehow, in our context, the wide worded 
conferment of discretionary powers or 
reservation of discretion, without framing 
rules to regulate its exercise, has been 
taken to be an enhancement of the power 
and it gives that impression in the first 
instance but where the authorities fail to 
rationalize it and regulate it and regulate 
it by Rules, or Policy statements or 
precedents, the Courts have to intervene 
more often, than is necessary, apart from 
the exercise of such power appearing 
arbitrary and capricious at times…”

Further reference, if so required, can be made to 
cases titled “Khalid Humayun vs. The NAB 
through D.G. Quetta and others” (PLD 2017 SC 
194) and “Commissioner of Inland Revenue 
(Legal), Peshawar vs. Khalid Umar Khan” (2016 
PTD 832). 
8.   
Now coming to the argument of Mr. 
Tabassam Ali that the reference application is only 
maintainable against the question of law or mixed 
question of law and facts that arises out of order 
passed by the learned Tribunal. He stated that the 
question sought to be answered is not arising out of 
the order under challenge. It is already settled that 
the questions required to be answered in reference-
applications include questions argued before the 
learned Tribunal on which the finding has been 
given as well as the questions argued but no 
finding has been given on such question(s). In case 
titled “Messrs F.M.Y. Industries Ltd vs. Deputy 
Commissioner Income Tax and another” (2014 
SCMR 907) the Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
addressed similar argument, as raised before us by 
the learned counsel for the respondents, in the 
following terms:-. 
“10. A perusal of the above extract reveals 
that the learned High Court only has to give 
opinion on questions of law raised before, it 
and not on the grounds mentioned in the 
appeal. It is now a settled law that only 
those questions can be raised before the 
learned High Court which are questions of 
law and are arising from the order of the 
Tribunal. Questions of law have been held 
to include questions argued before the 
Tribunal on which finding has been given 
by the Tribunal or questions argued before 
the Tribunal but no finding has been given 

I.T.R. No. 53185-2024 
I.T.R. No. 53180-2024 
 
6 
 
by the Tribunal on such questions and 
questions which were never argued but had 
been adjudicated by the Tribunal…”   
 
 
 
 (Emphasis is supplied) 
 
 
9.  
It appears that while concluding the 
appeals the above settled law has escaped the view 
of the learned Tribunal. We have already 
reproduced the operative part of the order 
challenged before us, which reflects that no 
question of law or facts before the learned Tribunal 
is addressed. The order is clearly devoid of proper 
reasoning. Therefore, the order dated 24.06.2024 is 
set-aside with the observation to pass a speaking 
order, as per law already discussed above. The case 
shall be deemed to be pending before the learned 
Tribunal on 14.10.2024 when the applicant shall 
ensure to appear. The learned Tribunal shall decide 
the appeals afresh within two months from the date 
fixed above.  
10.  
The question of law, reproduced above, 
is answered accordingly and in favour of the 
applicant. Office to send a copy of this order to the 
learned Tribunal as required under section 133(8) 
of the Ordinance.
