MASUD ABID NAQVI, J.  
Brief facts of this civil revision are 
that the plaintiffs namely Sheikh Amjad Saeed/predecessor in interest 
of the respondent No.1 and Sheikh Maalik Saeed/respondent No.4 
(hereinafter called the “plaintiffs”) filed a suit for specific 
performance with permanent injunction with the averments that the 
petitioners/defendants No.1&2 alongwith their brother namely 
Mohammad Saeed, sister/defendant No.3 & mother/defendant No.4 
were the owners of 11 Marlas land on which a shop also exists. The 
three brothers i.e. petitioners/defendants No.1, 2 & Mohammad Saeed 
agreed to sell the suit property on their behalf and on behalf of their 
sister & mother for a sale consideration of Rs.15,50,000/- (Fifteen 
Lacs and Fifty Thousand) vide agreement to sell dated 25.08.2004. An 
amount of Rs.50,000/-(Fifty thousand only) was received as earnest 

2 
C.R. No.3093 of 2012 
 
 
 
 
money and the balance consideration of Rs.15,00,000/- was agreed to 
be paid on or before 28.11.2004 at the time, the sale deed would be 
registered. When the plaintiffs asked the defendants to receive the 
remaining balance sale consideration amount and to execute the sale 
deed, only Mohammad Saeed performed his part of contract while the 
defendants No. 1 to 4 plainly refused. Hence, the plaintiffs were 
constrained to institute the instant suit for specific performance of 
contract against defendants No. 1 to 4 about the property, described in 
the headnote of plaint by deducting the already sold share of 
Muhammad Saeed.  The defendants contested the suit by way of filing 
written statement and written reply and by raising certain legal as well 
as factual objections. Out of divergent pleadings of the parties, issues 
were framed by the learned trial Court. The parties produced their 
respective evidence and after recording the same, the learned trial 
Court decreed the suit only against defendants No.1 and 2 subject to 
payment of Rs.10,00,000/- vide judgment and decree dated 
23.09.2011. Feeling aggrieved, the defendants No.1 to 4 filed an 
appeal challenging the said judgment and decree dated 23.09.2011 
and the learned Additional District Judge, Sheikhupura dismissed the 
appeal vide judgment and decree dated 07.07.2012 with slight 
modification by specific finding that since the defendants No.3 and 4 
were not party to the sale agreement, the suit as against them stood 
dismissed. Being aggrieved, only the defendants No.1 & 2/petitioners 
have filed the instant civil revision and challenged the validity of the 
impugned judgments and decrees passed by the learned Courts below 

3 
C.R. No.3093 of 2012 
 
 
 
 
while the plaintiffs also filed a Regular Second Appeal No.189/2012 
against the sister/defendant No.3 & mother/defendant No.4. 
2. 
During the arguments, learned counsel for plaintiffs/ 
respondents wants to withdraw the connected Regular Second Appeal 
No.189/2012 and same is dismissed as withdrawn vide separate order 
of even date passed in connected appeal. The learned counsel for the 
petitioners/defendants No.1 & 2 mainly argues that the time was the 
essence of the contract as has been specifically pleaded in written 
statement by the petitioners/ defendants No.1 & 2 on the failure of  
the plaintiffs to pay the balance amount within the stipulated period. 
However, the learned counsel for the plaintiffs fully supports the 
impugned judgments and decrees of the leaned Courts below.   
3. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsels for the parties 
and minutely gone through the record as well as the impugned 
judgments and decrees of the learned Courts below. 
4. 
An agreement to sell with respect to shop was allegedly 
executed between the plaintiffs namely Sheikh Amjad Saeed/ 
predecessor in interest of the respondent No.1 & Sheikh Maalik 
Saeed/ respondent No.4 & Mohammad Yousaf /predecessor in interest 
of the petitioners/ defendants on 31.08.1998 after receiving an amount 
of 100,000/- as earnest money out of a total sale consideration of 
Rs.500,000/- (Five Lacs). After the death of Mohammad Yousaf 
/predecessors in interest of the petitioners/defendants,  all the 
defendants filed an ejectment petition against the plaintiffs on 
27.06.2003 but during the pendency of that ejectment petition, three

C.R. No.3093 of 2012 
 
 
 
 
brothers i.e. petitioners/defendants No.1, 2 & Mohammad Saeed 
agreed to sell the suit property on their behalf and on behalf of their 
sister & mother to the plaintiffs for a sale consideration of 
Rs.15,50,000/- (Fifteen Lacs and Fifty Thousand) vide agreement to 
sell dated 25.08.2004, after receiving the earnest money of 
Rs.50,000/- (Fifty thousand only). Muhammad Saeed, brother of the 
petitioners/defendants No.1 & 2 performed his part of contract and 
was not impleaded in instant suit and the petitioners/defendants No.1 
& 2 although conceded the execution of agreement to sell dated 
25.08.2004 but refused to execute sale deed on the ground of alleged 
failure of the plaintiffs to pay the balance amount within specified 
time i.e. 28.11.2004. During the pendency of ejectment petition, an 
amount of Rs.4,00,000/- was paid by the plaintiffs to Mohammad 
Saeed on 29.03.2005 before the learned Rent Controller and he 
executed the sale deed in favour of plaintiffs to the extent of his share 
in suit property while time of execution of sale deed was extended by 
the rest of executants of agreement to sell, after recording the 
statements before the learned Rent Controller. The learned counsels 
for the contesting parties also recorded second statements on 
09.05.2006 before the learned Rent Controller, Sheikhupura, wherein 
the defendants No.1 & 2 / petitioners acknowledged the receipt of 
another amount of Rs.1,00,000/-. Hence, after the receipt of additional 
two payments of Rs.5,00,000/- (Five Lacs) by the executants of 
agreement to sell and extending time of execution of sale deed twice,  
the defendants No.1 & 2/petitioners cannot agitate the legal 

5 
C.R. No.3093 of 2012 
 
 
 
 
proposition that the time was the essence of the contract. By receiving 
above said amount(s), defendants No.1 & 2/petitioners No.1 & 2 
mutually agreed with the plaintiffs to extend time in agreement to sell 
therefore time does not remain as an essence of the contract. The 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case reported as Hafiz Shaikh 
ANWAR-UL-HAQUE through L.Rs Vs JEHAN KHAN and others 
(PLD 2011 SC 540) held that:- 
 
“…….In law, if time is extended for performance of a 
contract pertaining to immovable property, then time can 
never be enforced as of contract…….” 
 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case reported as 
GHULAM NABI and others Vs Seth MUHAMMAD YAQUB and 
others (PLD 1983 SC 78) also held that:- 
 
“…….Though time is not ordinarily considered as being 
of the essence of the contract involving transaction of 
immovable property but the true intention of the parties 
can be gathered from the terms of contract and facts and 
circumstances of the case and mere mention of time in 
the contract for its performance does not necessarily 
mean that time was the essence of contract…..” 
 
 
In a case reported as Faryad Ali Vs Rehmat Ali (PLD 2015 
Lahore 75), it has been held that:- 
 
“……In this contract as I have noticed that the 
defendant/respondent himself is receiving the money and 
extending 
the 
period 
and 
further 
that 
the 
defendant/respondent has never given any notice for 

6 
C.R. No.3093 of 2012 
 
 
 
 
termination of the contract on the basis that the time was 
essence of the contract and the plaintiff/petitioner could 
not perform his part of the contract…...” 
 
5. 
It is important to mention here that even after execution of 
agreement to sell and receipt of amount(s) before the learned Rent 
Controller, the petitioners not only failed to withdraw the ejectment 
petition as is specifically agreed in agreement to sell between the 
plaintiffs and defendants No.1 and 2/petitioners which was dismissed 
by the learned Rent Controller after discussing all the questions of 
facts and law vide judgment dated 22.02.2007 but also filed an appeal 
against the judgment which was also dismissed.  The learned Courts 
below have granted relief by considering the conduct of the parties, 
the principles of equity, fairness and good conscious by appreciating 
the pleadings of the parties as well as oral and documentary evidence 
of the parties and thereafter reached at the conclusion regarding the 
controversy, therefore, findings of learned Courts below are hereby 
maintained/ upheld. 
6. 
Even otherwise, with respect to interference in concurrent 
findings of the Courts below, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in a case reported as Administrator, Thal Development through EACO 
Bhakkar and others Vs Ali Muhammad (2012 SCMR 730) held that:- 
 
“Concurrent findings of the trial court and 
appellate court in favour of appellants were based 
on proper appreciation of evidence therefore, the 
same were not open to interference by the 
revisional court in exercise of its jurisdiction 
under section 115, C.P.C. which is primarily 

7 
C.R. No.3093 of 2012 
 
 
 
 
meant for correction of jurisdictional defect/error 
and material illegalities/irregularities, resulting in 
miscarriage of justice to a party.”  
 
 
7. 
Neither any misreading or non-reading of evidence on record 
nor any infirmity, legal or factual, has been pointed out in the 
impugned judgments and decrees passed by the learned Courts below, 
therefore, this civil revision is hereby dismissed.
