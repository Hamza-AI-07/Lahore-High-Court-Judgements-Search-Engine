C.M.No.7078 of 2023 
This is an application filed by appellants (who 
were defendants No.5, 6 & 7 in the Reference filed 
before the learned Senior Civil Judge, Rahim Yar 
Khan/Trial Court) to the effect that written statement on 
behalf of the appellants-defendants remained unsigned 
inadvertently; the learned counsel for applicants/ 
appellants submits that at any time, in terms of Order VI 
rule 14 CPC, the irregularity of non-signing of pleadings 
could be rectified/cured.  
2. 
The respondents (who were plaintiffs before the 
Trial Court) filed contesting reply to instant application 
in the form of application under Section 151 read with 
Order VI rule 14 CPC which has been numbered as C. M. 
No.3334 of 2024/BWP (perhaps inadvertently), whereby 
it has been claimed that the instant application (C.M. 
No.7078/2023) is liable to be dismissed as after decision 
of Reference, permission for signing the pleadings cannot 
be granted. Further states that said defendants/applicants 
had not put appearance as witnesses in the Court in 
support of their written statement, therefore, signing of 
the pleadings could not be permitted.

-:2:-
3. 
Be that as it may, Order VI rule 14 CPC provides 
as under:  
“14. Pleading to be signed.- Every pleading shall be 
signed by the party and his pleader (if any): 
 
Provided that where a party pleading is, by 
reason of absence or for other good cause, unable to 
sign the pleading, it may be signed by any person duly 
authorized by him to sign the same or to sue or defend 
on his behalf.”  
4. 
Perusal of written statement shows that it was 
signed and filed on behalf of respondents No.5 to 7 by 
their learned counsel who had been engaged to represent 
them, therefore, the same appears sufficient compliance 
of provision of Order VI rule 14 CPC. Furthermore, 
signing of written statement by any person with authority 
on behalf of department would be treated as signing by 
all the defendants relating to said department which is in 
accordance with law in terms of Judgments reported as 
Ismail and another v. Mst. Razia Begum and 3 others 
(1981 SCMR 687) and Messrs Liberty Car Parking 
(Pvt.) Ltd through Director v. Commissioner Inland 
Revenue (Ex-Commissioner of Income Tax/Wealth Tax), 
Lahore and others (2021 SCMR 375), which provide 
that in cases where pleadings had been signed by one of 
its officers, the same could be accredited by the company 
by express or implied action; furthermore, non-signing of 
pleadings was not an illegality rather a mere technicality/ 
irregularity which could always be cured as the same is a 
curable defect.  Besides, it is imperative that justice 
should be done instead of knocking out the parties on 
technicalities and no prejudice shall be caused to any of 
the parties if said defect is allowed to be cured; hence, we 
allow the instant application and grant permission to 
appellants to sign the written statement in the office of 
Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of this Court as LCR has

been requisitioned in compliance of order dated 
07.03.2023 of this Court.  
5. 
In view of above, as the miscellaneous application 
(C.M. No.3334 of 2024/BWP) which is actually the  
reply of the instant application (C.M.No.7078/2023) has 
wrongly been numbered by the office, it is also 
disposed of accordingly.
