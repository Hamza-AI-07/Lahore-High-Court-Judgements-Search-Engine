This constitutional petition challenges the order 
dated 12.5.2022 passed by the Presiding Officer of the 
Foreign 
Exchange 
Regulation 
Appellate 
Board 
(Appellate Board).  The impugned order states that: 
“The order dated 21.04.2022 passed for deposit of the 
surety of the equivalent amount of the penalty imposed 
by the adjudicating officer of State Bank of Pakistan 
has not been complied with.  Time is sought by the 
learned counsel for the appellant.  In the interest of 
justice, one more opportunity is granted to the 
appellant to submit the surety.  To come up on 
27.05.2022.” 
 
2. 
Prior to this vide order dated 21.4.2022 while 
relying upon Section 23C (4) of the Foreign Exchange 
Regulation Act, 1947 (“the Act, 1947”) the Presiding 
Officer of the Appellate Board had required the 
petitioner who is the appellant before the Appellate 
Board to deposit a surety equivalent to the amount of 
penalty imposed upon the petitioner and this was held 
to be a sine qua non for the appeal to be entertained and 
decided.  The petitioner prays for holding the 
provisions of Section 23C (4) to be unconstitutional on 
the ground that it offends the rights of the petitioners 

W.P.No.36748 of 2022 
 
 
2
to be treated in accordance with law fairly and justly.  
Also that the right of the petitioner to access of justice 
is also infringed thereby. 
3. 
Section 23C (4) of the Act, 1947 provides that: 
“23C(4) 
No appeal shall be admitted for hearing 
unless the appellant deposits in cash with the Appellate 
Board the amount of penalty or, at the discretion of the 
Appellate Board, furnishes security equal in value to 
such amount of penalty.” 
 
4. 
A reading of the provisions set out above shows 
that it clearly provides that no appeal shall be 
admitted for hearing unless the appellant before the 
Appellate Board deposits in cash amount of penalty or 
at the discretion of the Appellate Board furnishes 
security equal in value to such amount of penalty.  
Therefore, there is a complete prohibition enacted by 
sub-section (4) of Section 23C to the hearing of the 
appeal unless the pre-condition is satisfied by an 
appellant.  Suffice to say that this clearly is an 
infringement of the right which inheres in the 
petitioner to access to justice.  One of the most 
important planks of the right of access to justice is the 
right to file at least one appeal against the order which 
affects the rights of a person.  The right to file an 
appeal must be unimpeded and should not be 
circumscribed by a condition which surely takes away 
that right.  Sub-section (4) of Section 23C is one such 
provision which in fact is tantamount to taking away 
the right of the petitioner in not only filing of the 

W.P.No.36748 of 2022 
 
 
3
appeal but also the hearing to be granted on that 
appeal irrespective of whether it fulfills the condition 
or not.  It is one thing to say that the petitioner may be 
burdened with a condition in case he seeks the 
suspension of the determination of a liability against 
him pending the appeal but another aspect entirely to 
provide in the law that the hearing of the appeal will 
be contingent upon the fulfillment of a condition 
precedent which if unfulfilled takes away the right of 
appeal.  A clear distinction will have to be drawn 
between the two circumstances.  Surely, under civil 
law a money decree can only be suspended if adequate 
security is provided by the judgment debtor and as 
determined by appellate court.  But that mere fact does 
not mean that in case of failure to do so the appeal 
shall not be heard on its merits and that the appellant 
will be deprived of grant of hearing in the appeal itself 
unless he deposits the security equivalent to the 
amount of penalty.  Sub-section (4) of Section 23C is a 
clog on the right of the petitioner to be dealt with in 
accordance with law.  The petitioner has the right of 
filing at least one appeal and for that appeal to be 
heard without any pre-conditions attached to it.  This 
is a fundamental right under the Constitution and 
springs from Article 10A (Right to fair trial) which 
provides, inter alia, that for the determination of civil 
rights and obligations, a person shall be entitled to due 

W.P.No.36748 of 2022 
 
 
4
process.  It also emanates from Article 4.  This right has 
been established in a plethora of superior court 
judgments.  See for example Asfandyar Wali v. 
Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2001 SC 607) at 909.   The 
right is absolute and cannot be taken away by laying 
down a condition which undermines that right. 
5. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner has also 
referred to rule 8 of the Adjudication Proceedings and 
Appeal Rules, 1998 which makes the receipt of an 
appeal by the Appellate Board subject to compliance 
with sub-section (4) of Section 23C of the Act, 1947.  
Thus, the Rules too prohibit the Appellate Board from 
hearing the appeal unless the condition is satisfied. 
6. 
Such a condition has been the subject to litigation 
before the superior courts.  In Messrs Chenab Cement 
Product (Pvt.) Ltd. and others v. Banking Tribunal Lahore 
and others (PLD 1996 Lahore 672) while relying upon 
an earlier judgment passed by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in Messrs Eastern Rice Syncicate v. Central 
Board of Revenue, Government of Pakistan and others 
(PLD 1959 Supreme Court (Pak.) 364) a Full Bench of 
the Lahore High Court stated as under:- 
“8. 
The question as to whether the right of appeal 
can be made subject to condition of deposit came before 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan in M/s. Eastern Rice 
Syndicate v. Central Board of Revenue PLD 1959 SC 
(Pak.) 364 wherein it was ruled that such a condition, 
amount to negation of the right of appeal itself.  We 
are, therefore, of the view that the proviso to section 9 
places an unreasonable restriction on the right of 
appeal and cannot, therefore, be upheld.”

7. 
In view of the above, this petition is allowed.  The 
impugned orders are set aside.  Consequently, it is 
held that sub-section (4) of Section 23C of the Act, 1947 
as well as rule 8 of the Rules (to the extent that rule 
makes the receipt of an appeal subject to the 
compliance with sub-section (4) of Section 23C of the 
Act) 
as 
unconstitutional 
and 
violative 
of 
the 
fundamental rights of the petitioner and they are 
hereby struck down.
