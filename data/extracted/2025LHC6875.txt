JUDGEMENT 
 
Date of Hearing: 
17.11.2025 
Appellants by: 
M/s. Saif ul Malook and Waqas Ahmed, Advocates
Respondent by: 
Mr. Saqib Asghar Baig, Advocate 
 
KHALID ISHAQ, J. This Regular First Appeal, filed under section 
96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (C.P.C.), calls into question 
judgment and decree dated 12.11.2024 (“Impugned Judgment”) whereby 
the suit for recovery of Rs.12,000,000/-, along-with profit (the “Suit”), was 
decreed by the learned Additional District Judge, Toba Tek Singh (“Trial 
Court”), while exercising jurisdiction under Order XXXVII, Rules 1 & 2 of 
the CPC.  
2. 
Briefly, Respondent/Plaintiff filed the Suit before the Trial Court on 
the basis of a dishonored Cheque bearing No.0956536 dated 08.03.2023 for 
an amount of Rs.12,000,000/- drawn on United Bank Ltd., Adda Phaloor 
Branch, 
T.t. 
Singh 
(the 
“Cheque”), 
allegedly 
issued 
by 
the 
Appellants/Defendants from their joint account. Pursuant to the issuance of 
summons, the Appellants/Defendants appeared and filed application for 
leave to appear and defend, which application was allowed and leave was 
granted vide order dated 16.10.2023; the Appellants/Defendants filed written 
statement, contested the Suit and sought dismissal of the same. The plaint 
avers that the Defendants/Appellants availed various finance facilities, 
which were sanctioned with the help of the Respondent/Plaintiff being a 
banker and being faced with financial hardships for repaying the said finance 
facilities, 
the 
Appellants/Defendants 
asked 
for 
help 
to 
the

Respondent/Plaintiff and considering their request of borrowing the amount, 
the Respondent/Plaintiff managed to pay the Suit amount to the 
Appellants/Defendants through his various relatives.  
3. 
Conversely, the main defence of the Appellants/Defendants was that 
the Cheque is without consideration; Respondent/Plaintiff was a banker, 
who facilitated them in procuring various loans/finance facilities and for that 
purpose the Respondent/Plaintiff used to retain various cheques of the 
Appellants and the Cheque in issue was in his custody but he misused the 
Cheque and filed Suit on the basis thereof. Out of the divergent pleadings of 
the parties, following issues were framed:-  
1. 
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the decree for recovery of 
Rs.12,000,000/-/- alongwith profit from the defendants on the basis 
of cheque No.0596536 dated 08.02.2023? OPP 
2. 
Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action to file the instant suit? 
OPD  
3. 
Whether plaintiff has not come to the Court with clean hands? 
OPD 
4. 
Whether plaintiff is estopped by his words and conduct to file the 
instant suit and liable to be dismissed under order VII Rule 11 of 
CPC? OPD 
5. 
Relief. 
4. 
Both the parties led their oral as well as documentary evidence. The 
Respondent/Plaintiff appeared as PW-1 and also produced Muhammad 
Aqeel as PW-2, Muhammad Abdullah as PW-3, Manzoor Qadir as PW-4, 
Khurram Tahir Ch. as PW-5 and Ihtasham Aftab, Clerk Post Office as PW-
6. Respondent/Plaintiff also produced documentary evidence Ex.P1 to Ex.P7 
as well as Mark-A to Mark-U.  
5. 
On the other hand, Appellants/Defendants appeared as DW-1 and 
produced Shoban Tahir as DW-2. He also produced documentary evidence 
Ex.D1 & Ex.D2 as well as Mark-DA to Mark-DC. 
6. 
After evaluation of the evidence led by both the parties and while 
rendering findings on issues reproduced above, the Trial Court decreed the 
Suit vide the Impugned Judgment. Hence this Appeal.

7. 
Learned counsel for the Appellants/Defendants submits that the 
contents of the plaint are devoid of material particulars as to the 
consideration of the Cheque; adds that there are absolutely no details as to 
when, how and who paid the alleged amounts to the Appellants/Defendants, 
further submits that there are no witnesses cited/mentioned in the pleadings 
for asserting the purported payments to the Appellants/Defendants; adds that 
no evidence of credence was produced by the Respondent/Plaintiff, whereas, 
while decreeing the Suit, the Trial Court has proceeded to rely upon the 
disputed documents, which were merely marked and were produced in the 
statement of learned counsel for the Respondent/Plaintiff, thus, the same has 
no evidentiary value and the Trial Court erred in law while relying upon 
such documents.  
8. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the Respondent/Plaintiff 
vehemently supported the Impugned Judgment; contends that the appellant 
has failed to refute the presumption attached to the Cheque in terms of 
Section 118 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 (“Act”); submits that 
the payments in issue were made by and on behalf of the 
Respondent/Plaintiff through various banking transactions and the 
corresponding statements of accounts have been brought on record, the 
validity and veracity whereof has not been challenged in appeal. He has 
specifically referred to Mark-O to Mark-U to contend that these are bank 
statements reflecting that consideration amount was paid from time to time 
by the family members of the Respondent/Plaintiff; adds that the 
Appellants/Defendants has failed to make out a case that the Cheque was 
without consideration and the presumption attached in terms of Article 118 
of the Act remained unrebutted; argues that the Respondent/Plaintiff has 
produced sufficient evidence and witnesses, who have corroborated the 
averments of the plaint; finally submits that the Cheque pertains to the 
account of the Appellants/Defendants, its execution is not denied and only 
an attempt has been made to avoid the liability by way of concocting a story 
of obtaining finance facilities through the Respondent/Plaintiff.

Arguments heard, record perused.  
10. 
Issue No.1 is the only relevant issue requiring determination on the 
basis of pleadings of the parties. The onus to prove the same was placed 
upon Respondent/Plaintiff. 
11. 
Before proceeding further in the matter, it would be expedient to lay 
down the principles which govern a suit founded on the basis of a negotiable 
instrument. The instant Suit has been filed on the basis of a Cheque. One of 
the presumptions in terms of section 118 of the Act is that “….. every 
negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration, and that every 
such instrument when it has been accepted, endorsed, negotiated or 
transferred, was accepted, endorsed, negotiated or transferred for 
consideration”. The inference of presumption of consideration is thus the 
basis of every negotiable instrument. This presumption shall arise every time 
the execution of negotiable instrument is admitted by a defendant, which is a 
rebuttable presumption and can, of course, be rebutted by a defendant 
through a direct and circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that 
consideration is absent in which case the onus would shift onto the plaintiff. 
The initial proof of due execution of negotiable instrument by the defendant 
shall rest on the plaintiff and upon such discharge, the onus shall shift onto 
the defendant by the force of presumption of section 118 of the Act. It is 
then for the defendant to prove that the negotiable instrument is not 
supported by consideration, notwithstanding the fact that leave to appear and 
defend has been granted1. As regards the standard of proof for rebuttal of 
presumption of section 118 of the Act is concerned, the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held that such a presumption in favour of a cheque had to be 
rebutted strongly by issuer of the cheque2. It has also been settled that when 
the execution is not denied, the burden and standard of rebuttal is much 
heavier3. It is also vouched by the respectable authority that in a case where 
                                                 
1 Muhammad Azizur Rehman v. Liaquat Ali (2007 SCMR 1820), Haji Karim and another v. Zikar 
Abdullah (1973 SCMR 100) 
2 Rab Nawaz Khan v. Javed Khan Swati (2021 SCMR 1890) 
3 Muhammad Arshad and another v. Citibank N.A., Lahore (2006 SCMR 1347), Col. (Retd.) Ashfaq 
Ahmed and others v. Sh. Muhammad Wasim (1999 SCMR 2832) 

RFA No. 78871 of 2024

it is established that the cheque in issue belonged to the bank account of the 
defendant and the cheque has been dishonored due to “insufficient funds”, 
the rebuttal of presumption of negotiable instrument needs clear evidence of 
absence of consideration.  
12. 
The next question arises as to what ought to be the standard of 
threshold evidence required from the defendant to demonstrate that the 
consideration upon which the negotiable instrument is based or such 
consideration, as it is stated in the plaint, is highly improbable. In doing so, a 
defendant may rely on presumptions of fact as mentioned in Article 129 of 
the Qanoon-e-Shahadat, 1984 including the presumption that evidence 
which could be and is not produced would, if produced, be unfavourable to 
the person who withholds it4. The question of burden of proof, of course, 
becomes of academic nature once the parties lead the evidence after joining 
the issues. In such a situation, the Court has to weigh the evidence, both pro 
and contra, to make a determination about the issue on which evidence has 
been led. The legal position with regard to the evidence, a defendant is 
required to produce to rebut due consideration, has been stated by the Indian 
Supreme Court in the case of Bharat Barrel and Drum Manufacturing 
Company v. Amin Chand Payrelal [(1999) 3 SCC 35], which Judgment has 
extensively been referred and relied upon by our Courts. The relevant 
portion of the judgment reads as under: 
The defendant can prove the non-existence of consideration by raising a probable 
defence. If the defendant is proved to have discharged the initial onus of proof 
showing that the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or the 
same was illegal, the onus would shift to the plaintiff who will be obliged to prove 
it as a matter of fact and upon its failure to prove would disentitle him to the 
grant of relief on the basis of the negotiable instrument. The burden upon the 
defendant of proving the non-existence of the consideration can be either direct or 
by bringing on record the preponderance of probabilities by reference to the 
circumstances upon which he relies. In such an event the plaintiff is entitled under 
law to rely upon all the evidence led in the case including that of the plaintiff as 
well. In case, where the defendant fails to discharge the initial onus of proof by

showing the non-existence of the consideration, the plaintiff would invariably be 
held entitled to the benefit of presumption arising in his favour. The court may not 
insist upon the defendant to disprove the existence of consideration by leading 
direct evidence as existence of negative evidence is neither possible nor 
contemplated and even if led is to be seen with a doubt. The bare denial of the 
passing of the consideration apparently does not appear to be any defence. 
Something which is probable has to be brought on record for getting the benefit of 
shifting the onus of proving to the plaintiff. To disprove the presumption the 
defendant has to bring on record such facts and circumstances, upon 
consideration of which the court may either believe that the consideration did not 
exist or its non-existence was so probable that a prudent man would, under the 
circumstances of the case, shall act upon the plea that it did not exist.

13. 
A full bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of G. Vasu v. 
Syed Yaseen Sifuddin Quadri (AIR 1987 Andhra Pradesh 139) (cited with 
approval in Bharat Barrel’s case) had this to say about the negative proof 
cast upon the defendant in a recovery suit based on a negotiable instrument. 
Having referred to the method and manner in which the presumption under is to 
be rebutted and as to how, it thereafter 'disappears' we shall also make reference 
to three principles which are relevant in the context. The first one is connected 
with the practical difficulties that beset the defendant for proving a negative, 
namely that no other conceivable consideration exists. We had occasion to refer 
to this aspect earlier. Negative evidence is always in some sort circumstantial or 
indirect, and the difficulty or proving a negative lies in discovering a fact or 
series of facts inconsistent with the fact which we seek to disprove (Gulson, 
Philosophy of Proof, 2nd Edition, P. 153 quoted in Cross on Evidence, 3rd 
Edition, page 78 Fn). 
In such situations, a lesser amount of proof than is usually required may avail. In 
fact, such evidence as renders the existence of the negative probable may shift the 
burden on to the other party (Jones, quoted in A Sarkar on Evidence, 12th 
Edition, p.870).

14. 
Having considered the above legal principles5, I have considered the 
facts as stated in the pleadings of the parties with regard to the transaction in 
respect 
of 
which 
the 
Cheque 
was 
allegedly 
issued 
by 
the 
Appellants/Defendants to Respondent/Plaintiff. The plaint avers that the 
Cheque was issued in furtherance of a reconciliation reached between the 
parties through a Panchayat, whereas, there are no details as to the alleged 
respectable(s), who conducted the Panchayat. The plaint pleads that as a 
consequence of Panchayat’s decision, the Cheque was handed over to the 
Respondent/Plaintiff by the Appellants/Defendants in presence of 
Muhammad Abdullah son of Abdul Majeed (PW-3) and Muhammad Aqeel 
son of Abdul Sattar (PW-2). Both these witnesses were produced by the 
Respondent/ Plaintiff. PW-2 is real brother of the Respondent/Plaintiff, who 
admitted this fact while taking the witness stand; while facing the cross 
examination, PW-2 has admitted that no payment of consideration against 
the Cheque was made in his presence. He, however, deposed that the 
Appellants/Defendants used to take the funds from his office on the 
directions of Respondent/Plaintiff; he has further stated that around 
Rs.100,000/- was paid by him on behalf of Respondent/Plaintiff to the 
Appellants/Defendants, however, this witness failed to state the necessary 
details viz this meager amount i.e. the date, month or year when such 
payment of Rs.100,000/-, was allegedly made. PW-2 further admitted that 
the other witness i.e. Muhammad Abdullah (PW-3) is also their relative. As 
regards the testimony of PW-3, he has frankly admitted that no consideration 
of Cheque was paid by the Respondent/Plaintiff to the Appellants/ 
Defendants in his presence (شکيل نے انوار کو ميرے سامنے کوئی پيسے نہ ديے تهے). 
He further went on to depose that no payment or Cheque was exchanged in 
his presence (ميرے سامنے کوئی رقم يا چيک کا لين دين نہ ہوا). Although the plaint is 
devoid of the necessary details and the necessary material particulars as to 
when, where and how the amount in question was paid, if any, by the 
Respondent/Plaintiff to the Appellants/Defendants. As settled, such defect 
by itself is an incurable defect on the touchstone of settled principles of law 
                                                 
5 These principles have also been discussed in an unreported judgment authored by Shams Mehmood 
Mirza, J. in the case of “Bashir Ahmed v. Haji Muhammad Ali”, (RFA No. 1141 of 2015).

that the parties are bound by their pleadings and no amount of evidence can 
be led or relied upon, which is beyond the scope of pleadings6, however, 
considering the aspect of special jurisdiction and element of a negotiable 
instrument being the basis of claim, I have minutely perused the evidence 
and statement of Respondent/Plaintiff (PW-1), which evidence/statement 
further reflects that even the oral statement fails to supply these details and 
much reliance was placed upon the reconciliation brought about through 
Panchayat. A case was sought to be made that the payments were allegedly 
made to the Appellants/Defendants through the relatives of the 
Respondent/Plaintiff, however, neither any such details have specifically 
been incorporated in plaint nor those relatives have been produced for 
proving the payment of consideration against the alleged Cheque. The 
evidence in the form of statements of PW-2 & PW-3 has been discussed 
above, whereas, PW-4 is Branch Manager of United Bank Ltd., who was 
only witness to the fact of Cheque being issued from the Cheque Book of the 
Appellants/Defendants. Similarly, PW-5 & PW-6 were produced as 
witnesses for the purpose of proving the issuance of notice of default to the 
Appellants/Defendants, however, it is of note that overwhelming documents 
have been produced in the statement of learned counsel for the 
Respondent/Plaintiff, some of these documents have been exhibited, 
whereas, the remainder of the documents were marked. One such document 
is Mark-O, which has been relied upon by the Trial Court for decreeing the 
Suit. These documents have no evidentiary value as the same were tendered 
in evidence through counsel’s statement, which documents should not have 
been considered as per settled law that the disputed documents cannot be 
tendered in evidence in statement of the counsel for a party because such 
procedure deprives the opposing party to test the authenticity of those 
                                                 
6 Moiz Abbas v. Mrs. Latifa and others (2019 SCMR 74); Saddaruddin through LRs v. Sultan Khan (Since 
deceased) through LRs and others (2021 SCMR 642) Muhammad Nawaz alias Nawaza and others v.

and another (2014 SCMR 922)

documents by exercising his right of cross examination7. Thus, all those 
documents brought on record in the statement of the learned counsel for the 
plaintiff were merely marked for the reason that these documents were 
neither produced in original nor tendered in evidence from the 
person(s)/witnesses competent to produce, and are thus, inconsequential, 
having no evidentiary value, have erroneously been relied upon by the Trial 
Court.  
15. 
The testimonies of the witnesses of the Appellants/Defendants are 
also contradictory as discussed above  and no credence can be attached to 
their statements. The financial worth of the appellant to have advanced a 
huge amount of Rs.12,000,000/- was also not proved in these set of facts; 
further, in absence of any evidence of plaintiff’s assertion that the amounts 
borrowed by the defendants was being paid by his relatives is devoid of any 
plausible basis. In fact, it is not at all clear from the evidence on the record 
as to what was the source of income of the appellant and who made the 
alleged payments.  
16. 
From the evidence produced by the Appellants/Defendants, it has 
been established by them that the Respondent/Plaintiff was a banker, who 
used to help the Appellants/Defendants in procuring the finance facilities 
and abused the fiduciary relation while misusing the Cheque.  
17. 
As per Article 2(4) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, different 
standards of proof are applicable in civil, criminal and quasi criminal cases. 
If a fact is asserted by a party, it does not require a perfect proof of fact, as it 
is very rare to have absolute certainty on facts. This provision sets the 
standard of prudent man. The principle of preponderance of probability is 
applicable in civil cases8. The standard of proof is well settled for the civil 
cases which are ordinarily decided on the evidential standards of 
                                                 
7 “Rustam and others v. Jehangir (deceased) through L.R.s” (2023 SCMR 730); “Mst. Akhtar Sultana v. 
Major Retd. Muzaffar Khan Malik through his legal heirs and others” (PLD 2021 SC 715); “Manzoor 
Hussain v. Misri Khan” (PLD 2020 SC 749); “Hameeda Begum v. Irshad Begum” (2007 SCMR 996)  
8 Salamat Ali and others v. Muhammad Din and others (PLD 2022 SC 353), Chief Justice of Pakistan 
Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhary v. President of Pakistan through Secretary and others (PLD 2010 SC 61) 

RFA No. 78871 of 2024

preponderance of probability9. The standard of balance of probability means 
that establishing is dependent upon whether, on the basis of evidence, the 
Court considers and concludes that occurrence of the fact was more likely 
than not. In re H (Minors) [1996] AC 563, Lord Nicholls explained that it 
was a flexible test10: 
“Built into the preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of 
flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation. Although the result is 
much the same, this does not mean that where a serious allegation is in issue the 
standard of proof required is higher. It means only that the inherent probability 
or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when 
weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. 
The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did 
occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established.” 
18. 
Considering the standards of preponderance of probabilities, I am 
satisfied that the Appellants/Defendants were able to successfully refute the 
presumption of the negotiable instrument in terms of Section 118 of the Act 
by proving that the consideration underlying the Cheque was absent. Thus, 
the onus was successfully shifted upon the Respondent/Plaintiff, who had 
failed to prove that the alleged amount was advanced to the 
Appellants/Defendants or that the Cheque in question was issued against 
valid consideration. No reasonable person looking at the facts of the case, as 
established through the evidence, could arrive at the conclusion that the 
Respondent/Plaintiff would collect the amounts from various relatives and 
will give it to the Appellants/Defendants, particularly, when no such relative 
was produced in the witness box. This clearly brings home that the 
Respondent/Plaintiff failed to discharge the burden of issue No.1, which was 
placed upon him. After thorough examination of the merits of the case and 
Impugned Judgment, I am of the view that the findings rendered by the Trial 
Court are not in accordance with law as these findings are based on patent 
misreading and non-reading of the record and evidence; have been handed 
down while ignoring the settled principles of law, therefore, the same are set
