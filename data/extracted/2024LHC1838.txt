           Mr. Hammad Khalid Butt, Advocate.  
Respondents No.2&3 by: M/s Ch. Muhammad Jameel Zafar

AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J. Through this Regular 
Second Appeal filed under Section 100 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 („CPC‟), the appellant has called into question the 
vires, validity and legality of the judgment & decree of learned lower 
Appellate Court dated 22.03.2002 pursuant whereto the appeal 
preferred by the respondents was accepted, judgment & decree of the 
learned Trial Court dated 16.01.1996 was set-aside and consequently 
suit of the appellant was dismissed.  
2. 
Relevant facts forming background of the proceedings in hand 
are that plaintiff/predecessor of appellants, namely, Asghar Ali, 
(hereinafter referred to as „appellant‟) instituted a suit on 07.03.1990 for 
recovery of possession, cancellation of registered sale deed dated 
03.05.1988 attested in favour of defendants/respondents No.2 to 4 
(hereinafter referred to as „respondents‟) from defendant/respondent 
No.1 Ahmad Ali and sought performance of an agreement to sell 
whereby respondent No.1 agreed to sell his land measuring 103 
Kanals, 04 Marlas (hereinafter referred to as „suit property‟) for a 
consideration of Rs.165,000/- and after receipt of Rs.130,000/- as an 

R.S.A. No.75 of 2002.  
2
earnest money executed the agreement to sell on 08.03.1986. It was 
pleaded that after execution of the agreement to sell, respondent 
No.1 transferred the suit property to respondents No.2 to 4 through 
registered sale deed dated 03.05.1988 for a consideration of 
Rs.380,000/- and thereafter respondent No.4 sold his share 
measuring 47 Kanals & 04 Marlas through oral sale mutation 
No.1180 dated 28.02.1990 to respondent No.5 for a consideration of 
Rs.180,000/-. Appellant prayed for cancellation of sale deeds and 
decree of his suit.  
3. 
     The suit was resisted by the respondents through filing of 
contesting written statements. Respondents in their written statement 
denied the execution of agreement to sell in favour of the appellant 
and claimed it to be forged and fictitious. They categorically denied 
the signatures of respondent No.1 on agreement to sell and 
purchasing of stamp paper, however, admitted that they purchased 
the suit property from respondent No.1 through registered sale deed 
with consideration and prayed for dismissal of the suit. Respondent 
No.5 also denied the execution of the agreement to sell and 
maintained that said agreement was prepared through fraud and the 
signatures attributed to respondent No.1 are also forged and fictitious 
by maintaining that the agreement has been prepared ante-dated by 
procuring stamp papers of back dates. In last, he prayed for dismissal 
of the suit. In the light of divergent pleadings of the parties, learned 
Trial Court reduced the controversy into necessary issues and after 
recording evidence of the parties pro & contra, oral as well as 
documentary decreed the suit vide judgment & decree dated 
16.01.1996. Feeling aggrieved, respondents preferred an appeal. 
During the pendency of said appeal, at the time of arguments parties 
reached to a consensus that original record qua identity card of 
witness Mubashir be summoned and if in the middle column figure 
“89” or the figure after the year “86” appears then the suit of the 
appellant be dismissed and if the figure of “86” or before it reflects, 
then, the appeal be dismissed. Said statement of respondents 
(appellants in the said appeal) was accepted by Muhammad Sarwar 

R.S.A. No.75 of 2002.  
3
(General Attorney of Asghar Ali, appellant). Learned Appellate Court after 
recording statements of the parties, summoned the original file of the 
registration office of Identity Card and adjourned the proceedings for 
09.01.1997. On the said date, Muhammad Asif Butt, Registration 
Clerk attended the Court along with relevant record but due to 
transfer of the Presiding Officer, no proceedings could be conducted. 
On that date, appellant also moved an application under Section 151 
of C.P.C., for elaboration of interim order dated 08.12.1996 
Respondents submitted its written reply on 05.03.1997 and the 
learned lower Appellate Court vide order dated 19.02.2002 
dismissed the same with cost of Rs.3,000/-. The appellant moved a 
review petition on 12.03.2002 for recalling of said order and also 
deposited the cost. In the meanwhile learned lower Appellate Court 
recorded the statement of Clerk of the Registration Office who 
produced the original record with regard to the Identity Card of 
witness Muhammad Mubashir S/o Muhammad Siddique and after 
retaining the photocopy of the register as Mark-A returned the 
original register. Thereafter, in the light of said record of 
Registration Office wherein Identity Card of Mubashir was issued on 
02.01.1989 the appeal was allowed by dismissing the appellant‟s suit 
vide judgment and decree dated 22.03.2002 and the review petition 
filed by the appellant was also dismissed on the same date vide 
separate order. Feeling aggrieved, appellant filed instant Regular 
Second Appeal. The appeal was dismissed by this Court on the 
ground that the appellant failed to implead the parties of the suit in 
the memorandum of appeal by declaring that said appeal having not 
been properly constituted vide judgment & decree dated 05.06.2007. 
The appellant assailed said judgment & decree through appeal (Civil 
Appeal No.255-L of 2010) before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
which was allowed vide order dated 05.11.2020 with the observation 
that cases should be heard and decided on merits rather than being 
dismissed on such procedural technicalities and the matter was 
remanded with a direction to decide the same afresh on merits.

    I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
perused the record with their able assistance.  
5. 
     The appellant, through his suit, sought performance of the 
agreement to sell dated 08.03.1986 (Exh.P-1).  Perusal of said 
document reflects that the stamp paper used for executing the said 
agreement to sell was issued vide serial No.1262 on 08.03.1986 in 
the name of Ahmad Ali (vendor). Said agreement has been shown to 
be witnessed by Muhammad Asghar Ali S/o Ali Muhammad 
(Identity Card No.303-42-389888), Muhammad Azeem Hashmi s/o 
Ghulam Mohy-ud-Din (Identity Card No.303-08-013996) and 
Muhammad Mubashir s/o Muhammad Siddique (Identity Card 
No.305-89-446872). Respondents No.1 to 4 and respondent No.5 in 
their written statements categorically denied the execution of said 
agreement to sell and claimed it to be forged and fictitious.  
Resondent No.5 also took a stance that agreement to sell was 
prepared anti-dated while showing the back-dates. In this 
background, when one of the attesting witness namely Muhammad 
Mubashir appeared as P.W.2, he was specifically cross-examined on 
17.11.1991. He deposed that when the agreement Exh.P-1 was 
executed, he was 16/17 years old, however, he maintained that when 
he witnessed the agreement at that time his Identity Card had been 
prepared. He maintained that only one Identity Card was issued to 
him and deposed that he did not remember as to when the same was 
prepared. Said Mubashir appeared as PW-3 on 08.03.1992 and 
produced his Identity Card as Exh.P-4 and during cross examination 
maintained that his Identity Card was prepared almost 2/3 years ago. 
Said Identity Card has become blur/obscure and most of the contents 
are illegible. The respondents specifically argued that according to 
the statement of PW at the time of execution of the agreement to sell 
(Exh.P-1) he was at the age of 16/17 years, whereas, his identity card 
was prepared in the year 1989 and it clearly shows that the 
agreement to sell (Exh.P-1) was prepared in the back dates which 
was shown to be executed on 08.03.1986. Learned Trial Court also 

R.S.A. No.75 of 2002.  
5
replied the said objection in Para-12 of the judgment which reads as 
under: 
“I am not in agreement with the argument advanced by learned 
counsel for the defendants because the identity-card Ex.P4 of 
P.W2 is absurd and entries on it are not readable. Further the 
defendants have not produced the record of identity-card office to 
prove that this identity-card was prepared in the year 1989. The 
perusal of agreement to sell Ex.P1 indicates that the figures of 
identity-card number of P.W2 are not under the ink of thumb 
impression of P.W2 on the agreement to sell, whereas the other 
word such as “تحصیل” is under the ink of the thumb impression. It 
means that the identity-card number of P.W2 on the agreement to 
sell Ex.P1 was not mentioned at the time of writing of agreement 
to sell. It looks that it was mentioned on it afterwards. It therefore, 
goes to show that it is an over act of plaintiff to further secure his 
rights. In view of this overact of the plaintiff, it cannot be 
observed that the document Ex.P1 was prepared in back dates 
particularly when its execution by defendant No.1 is proved from 
evidence on the record.” 
 
6. 
The respondents in their memo of appeal also raised said 
ground. In the light of said scenario, at the time of arguments parties 
reached to a consensus that original record qua identity card of 
witness Mubashir be summoned and if in the middle column figure 
“89” or figure after the year “86” appears then the suit of the 
appellant be dismissed and if the figure of “86” or before it reflects 
then the appeal be dismissed. Said statement of respondents was 
accepted by Muhammad Sarwar (General Attorney of Asghar Ali, 
appellant). Learned Appellate Court after recording statements of the 
parties, summoned the original file of registration office of Identity 
Card and adjourned the proceedings for 09.01.1997. For better 
understanding, the order of Court dated 05.12.1996 with statements 
are reproduced in verbatim as under:

7. 
     Perusal of said order reflects that Rasheed Ahmad, 
Muhammad Yousaf, appellants of said appeal put their thumb 
impressions while Muhammad Saeed made his signature. Their 
counsel also made his signature. Whereas, attorney of the appellant 
namely Muhammad Sarwar put his thumb impression and his 
counsel also made his signature on the margin of order-sheet. Said 
proceedings were conducted in presence of the learned counsel for 
the parties. On 09.01.1997 Muhammad Asif Butt, Registration Clerk 
Office of Identity Card Sialkot appeared with record, however, his 
statement could not be recorded due to transfer of the Presiding 
Officer. Appellant moved an application on 08.01.1997 under 
Section 151 C.P.C. for elaboration of interim order dated 05.12.1996 
with the contention that he is an illiterate person who was not made 
to comprehend the position on 05.12.1996, as such, the consent 
given by him should be deemed as withdrawn, unless the interim 
order is modified to the extent that the proof of either side on the 
issue will also be taken in consideration. Said application was 
adjourned to 09.01.1997 and on the said date copy was handed over 
to the respondents for its reply. The respondents resisted the 
application by filing contesting written reply. The learned Trial 
Court dismissed said application on 19.02.2002 with cost of 
Rs.3000/- and adjourned the proceedings for 12.03.2002. On the said 

R.S.A. No.75 of 2002.  
7
date, cost was paid and the appellant moved another application 
under Section 114 read with Order XLVII Rule I for review of the 
order dated 19.02.2002 and the proceedings were adjourned to 
21.03.2002 for arguments. On 21.03.2002, in the light of order dated 
05.12.1996, Muhammad Iqbal Registration Clerk, Registration 
Office Sialkot appeared and got recorded his statement. He deposed 
that he has brought the Office Record and according to the record at 
page No.94, serial No.446872 of the register name of Mubashir 
Ahmad s/o Muhammad Siddique is entered and the said entry qua 
procuring Identity Card has been made on 02.01.1989. He produced 
original register and after inspection photocopy was placed on the 
record as Mark-A and original register was returned.  
8. 
The learned lower Appellate Court, in the light of consensus 
arrived at between the parties on 05.12.1996 and keeping in view the 
statement of Registration Clerk, entry in Register (Mark-A) wherein it 
was specifically mentioned that Identity Card of Mubashir Ahmad 
was prepared on 02.01.1989 allowed the appeal and dismissed the 
suit of the appellant vide impugned judgment & decree dated 
22.03.2002.  
9. 
Learned counsel for the appellant argued that appellant 
promptly moved an application for withdrawal of his consent under 
Section 151 C.P.C. on 08.01.1997. He adds that the Court should 
have to be careful to see that such offer and acceptance are not 
recorded with the same snap speed with which they are made. 
Further states that the learned Court should not have acted so 
promptly, rather every possibility of ambiguity or emotions should 
have been ruled out before permitting such arrangement.  
10. 
As discussed earlier, parties did not arrive at the consensus at 
the heat of the moment. Perusal of record reflects that respondents in 
their written statement and during the course of cross-examination 
over PW-2 namely Mubashir specifically put the question that he 
was minor when the agreement to sell (Exh.P-1) was allegedly 
executed and his Identity Card was prepared after the date of 
execution of the agreement to sell. In this regard, his Identity Card 

R.S.A. No.75 of 2002.  
8
was brought on record as Exh.P-4 which was blur/obscure and not 
readable. Mubashir while recording his statement as PW-3 on 
08.03.1992 admitted that his Identity Card was made 2/3 years back. 
However, his Identity Card number was mentioned in the agreement 
to sell (Exh.P-1) and the figure “89” is reflecting in the middle 
column, the year of preparation of Identity Card. Said point was 
argued before the learned Trial Court which was also discussed in 
the judgment of learned Trial Court which is reproduced supra. 
Moreover, this point was specifically taken by the respondents in 
their memorandum of appeal. In these circumstances, it cannot be 
said that the point upon which consensus developed between the 
parties was a surprising thing for the appellant, hence, in these 
circumstances, appellant cannot resile or deviate from the settlement.  
11. 
    The Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled 
“MUHAMMAD ALI Vs. MAJOR MUHAMMAD ASLAM AND OTHERS” 
(PLD 1990 SC 841), observed that the question whether the party 
who has made an offer can resile from it depends upon the facts & 
circumstances of each case and explained such facts & 
circumstances in the following manner: 
“11. In cases such as the present, where it is not possible to lay 
down guiding principles as to what facts or circumstances in a given 
case would induce a judge to permit a party to resile from either the 
offer or the acceptance, it is necessary for the Court to guard itself 
and the parties against snap decisions taken by the parties in this 
connection. More often that not, during examination of a party or a 
witness, or during a heated discussion or argument, a party in the 
excitement of the moment may be led to make a snap decision in this 
respect. He may in the heat of passion make such an offer, or accept 
such a one, which otherwise in a state of cool deliberation he would 
not do. The Court should be careful to see that such offers and 
acceptances are not recorded with the same snap speed with which 
they are made, for such offers and acceptances would not be founded 
in piety and grace and would not be made at the highest level of 
truth. For no sooner a person makes an offer to another to make a 
statement on the Holy Qur'an or his Holy Book, whichever it may be, 
with regard to any matter or fact, the effect of which will be to bind 
him in a particular manner, for good or for worse, he does so on the 
assumption that the person who will accept it is conscious of his 
trust and whilst making the statement on the Holy Book shall place 
himself figuratively before his Maker and his Holy Prophet and state 
the truth, on pain of divine wrath. The Court should, therefore, be 
somewhat circumspect in this matter and refrain from permitting 
parties to enter into such agreements, which otherwise do not appear 
to have been made by them in some reasonable frame of mind, or 
which appear to be the result of indecent haste, or which otherwise, 
from the apparent conduct of any of the parties, appear to be such as 

R.S.A. No.75 of 2002.  
9
would make a mockery of the oath. The need for recording separate 
statements of the parties in respect of the offer and acceptance made 
in such cases deserves to be over-emphasized, for such a procedure 
would give parties some short time to think over the matter and 
extricate themselves from hasty decisions, before appending their 
signatures to their statements. We do not wish to go down on the 
record as suggesting that this procedure must invariably be observed, 
for there is no such legal compulsion, not do we want to suggest that 
certain safeguards suggested here should be treated as rules of 
prudence to be observed in such cases, because sections 9 to 11 of 
the Oaths Act do not admit of such intrusions, but we would say that 
all this may be treated as a note of caution, for a Court is as much 
bound to ensure the solemnity of these proceedings, as the parties 
are bound to respect them.” 
 
12. 
      Learned counsel for the appellant also argued that learned 
lower appellate Court while dismissing his application with cost 
allowed him to argue on the main appeal subject to payment of 
Rs.3000/- and as the cost was paid, therefore, the learned Lower 
Appellate Court was bound to provide opportunity of arguments on 
main appeal and should have decided the main appeal after giving 
issue-wise findings. The said contention of learned counsel for the 
appellant has no force as the learned lower Appellate Court passed 
the order in the following terms: 
“This application is dismissed with cost of Rs.3000/- to the 
respondent. Respondent shall have a right of argument on main 
appeal subject to payment of Rs.3000/-.” 
 
Through the said order permission was granted, subject to payment 
of cost to argue his view point in the light of order dated 05.12.1996. 
13. 
      Appellant moved the application for recalling of his 
consent when the offer made by the respondents was accepted by 
him and had become a binding contract. Offer made by a party to 
decide the lis on a particular way when accepted by the other side 
had matured into an agreement, same was enforceable under the law 
and nobody would be allowed to resile from it unless said 
agreement/contract was either void or had become frustrated.  
14. 
      An agreement made in the Court is a settlement to which 
the Court is also a party, therefore, such an agreement is not one of 
those agreements which a party may keep or break as it liked. To 
allow a party to resile from his earlier commitment without adequate 
reason would amount to allowing him to play a game of  hide and 

R.S.A. No.75 of 2002.  
10
seek with other party and even would amount to abuse the process of 
Court.  
15. 
     Where parties choose deviation from normal course and a 
mode (procedure) for decision of lis is adopted by the Court on their 
request, the decision given in pursuance thereof should be given 
effect to and the parties are estopped from challenging such mode of 
decision and they could not resile or feel aggrieved against the 
procedure adopted by the Court.  
16. 
     Appellant would have no right whatsoever to wriggle out 
from such accepted offer being an agreement of binding nature and 
also on the principle of approbate and reprobate. It is settled 
proposition of law that offer once made by any party and accepted by 
the other party becomes a binding contract between the parties and 
nobody is allowed to resile or back out from it on the principle of 
estoppel. Reliance is placed on the cases titled “SALEEM AHMAD Vs. 
KHUSHI MUHAMMAD” (1974 SCMR 224), “ATTIQULLAH  Vs. 
KAFAYATULLAH” (1981 SCMR 162), MUHAMMAD MANSHA AND 7 
OTHERS Vs. ABDULSATTAR AND 4 OTHERS (1995 SCMR 795) 
MUHAMMAD RAFIQUE AND ANOTHER Vs. SAKHI MUHAMMAD AND 
OTHERS (PLD 1996 SC 237).   
17. 
      I have carefully gone through the case laws referred by 
learned counsel for the appellant (Muhammad Akbar and another Vs. 
Muhammad Aslam and another (PLD 1970 SC 241), Ghulam Qadir Vs. Fazal 
Din and 3 others (1971 SCMR 537) and Mirza Muhammad Siddique Vs. 
Muhammad Abdullah (1989 MLD 54) and observed that the same are 
distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the case in hand.  
18. 
         Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant 
remained unable to point out any substantial error or procedural 
defect in the impugned judgment & decree of the lower Appellate 
Court. He failed to satisfy the Court with regard to presence of basic 
ingredients of regular second appeal that the impugned judgment and 
decree is contrary to law or failed to determine material issue of law, 
or usage having the force of law; committed a substantial error or 
defect in the procedure provided by C.P.C, or by other law for the 
time being in-force, which may possibly have produced error or 

R.S.A. No.75 of 2002.  
11
defect in the decision of the case upon the merits. The judgment & 
decree of the first Appellate Court is neither perverse nor arbitrary, 
so as to justify the interference of this Court in exercise of 
jurisdiction as contemplated under Section 100 of CPC.  
19. 
      The learned Appellate Court rightly decided the appeal in 
the light of consensus arrived at between the parties on 05.12.1996. 
Even otherwise when it was established on record that Identity Card 
had been issued to Mubashir witness on 02.01.1989, it made the 
agreement to sell anti-date/doubtful which was allegedly executed on 
08.03.1986 wherein name of witness Mubashir was entered with his 
Identity Card No.305-89-446872. The specific performance is a 
discretionary relief. Such discretion can be exercised or recognized 
on the principles of equity and fairness.  
20. 
      Consequently, instant Regular Second Appeal is dismissed 
being devoid of force/substance with no order as to costs.
