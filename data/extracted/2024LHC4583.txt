Raheel Kamran J:- In this petition under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 (‘the Constitution’), the petitioner has made the following 
prayer: - 
“It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that to stop the 
meritless and illegal search/appointments of the VCs by the 
search committee at eleven (11) universities of the Punjab 
and further directed to respondent No.5 to produce the 
record of all applications of VC ships. 
It is further prayed that the award of the numbers of 
the PhD (Either 35 or 29) be stopped which causes 
discrimination. 
It is further prayed that respondents No.1 to 4 may 
kindly 
be 
directed 
to 
cancel 
the 
search/selection 
appointment’s procedure of VCs Punjab in the interest of 
justice.” 
 
2.      The facts giving rise to this petition are that the petitioner 
being Professor of University of Education Lahore, Vehari 
Campus, in response to advertisement published in the 
newspaper for appointment of the Vice Chancellors (‘VCs’) of 

2 
W.P.No.52354 of 2024 
Universities located in Punjab, submitted application after 
fulfilling all codal formalities, however, subsequently different 
print and electronic media broke the news that the search 
committees had finally recommended eleven vice chancellors 
and forwarded their cases to the Chief Minister, Punjab for 
approval. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that favourite 
candidates have been nominated without calling the petitioner 
for any interview or issuing him rejection letter.  He maintains 
that out of eleven recommended candidates, few of them have 
been working for the second and third time as VCs and during 
their tenure the universities have suffered from severe financial 
and management crises.  He further contends that local PhD 
degree holders are being treated with discrimination against the 
foreigner PhD degree holders, as without any reasonable 
classification the former are allocated 29 marks whereas the 
latter are assigned 35 marks, which constitutes violation of 
Article 25 of the Constitution for PhD by foreign universities is 
only available to those fortunate ones who possess financial 
resources to pursue education there.  He adds that the Search 
Committees constituted for recommendation of the VCs have 
violated the merit policy and failed to follow the transparent 
procedure.  He finally contends that appointments of the 
candidates who are going to be retired in a few days are just 
aimed to enhance their length of service.  
4. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer contends that after 
scrutiny of record of all the candidates who applied for the posts 
of VCs by the Technical Review Committee constituted by the 
Search Committee, only eligible candidates were called for 
interview and all those who were not called were found 
ineligible.  He maintains that Provincial Cabinet of the Punjab 
has approved the selection criteria for VCs of public sector 
universities which was duly notified on 25.05.2024 and the 

3 
W.P.No.52354 of 2024 
petitioner while accepting the same applied for the said post, 
however, when he was not called for interview, he filed the 
instant petition challenging the eligibility criteria.  He further 
contends that the universities are ranked using the Quacquarelli 
Symonds (QS) ranking system which categorizes institutions 
into various classifications and identifies the leading universities 
worldwide. 
5. 
Learned Law Officer representing the Higher Education 
Department submits that the instant petition has become 
infructuous since appointments in question of the VCs have been 
finalized.   
6. 
Heard. 
7. 
It is by now well settled that discretion of the Chief 
Minister with regard to appointments of VCs in the public sector 
universities is not altogether unfettered and the reasons which 
would prevail upon him or her for such appointments are 
justiciable1. The Courts can examine the same on the touchstone 
of validity, fairness and compliance with the law, rules and 
departmental practice2. The matter of appointments of VCs in 
the public sector universities was earlier dealt with by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Human Rights Case No.13865-P 
of 2018 vide order dated 22.04.2018 emphasizing such 
appointments on the basis of recommendations of Search 
Committees for precluding any arbitrary and capricious exercise 
of discretion.  
8. 
In the instant case, no question over the constitution of 
Search Committees or on any of their members has been raised. 
In the prayer clause, this Court in the first place has been urged 
to stop the alleged meritless and illegal search/appointments of 
the VCs by the Search Committees in eleven universities of the

Punjab after calling for record of all applications submitted in 
that regard.  
9. 
There is no cavil that the scope of judicial power under 
clause (c) of Article 199(1) of the Constitution is wider than 
other provisions in the aforementioned Article inasmuch as 
under such exercise of jurisdiction this Court can issue any 
appropriate direction for enforcement of any of the fundamental 
rights guaranteed under Chapter I of Part II of the Constitution3, 
however, issuance of such direction should be necessary for the 
enforcement of the fundamental right, appropriate in the facts 
and circumstances of the case, which must not be a 
disproportionate measure. In contradistinction to that, directions 
in the nature of mandamus or prohibition under clause (a) of 
Article 199(1) are confined to act as required by law or refrain 
from acting in a manner not permitted by law.  
10 
There is no specific violation of law, policy or merit 
attributed to Search Committees in this case but only vague and 
general allegations have been levelled by the petitioner. 
 
One of the reasons prevailing with the petitioner for 
claiming favouritism against the Search Committees is that he 
has not received any rejection letter. It is noted that the 
advertisement for the appointments in question, copy whereof is 
annexed with this petition, reflects that only short-listed/eligible 
candidates were to be interviewed by the respective Search 
Committees.  
The other ground urged by the petitioner is that it is 
second or third term of some of the recommended candidates 
and during their earlier tenures the universities had undergone 
severe financial and management crisis but none of them has 
been named specifically in this petition or in the course of 
arguments.

   others (PLD 2009 SC 507), and   
  Abdul Wahab v. HBL and others (2013 SCMR 1383). 

5 
W.P.No.52354 of 2024 
As regards the contention that some of the recommended 
candidates are going to retire in a few days, besides having not 
specified any particular person, the advertisement in question 
itself shows the maximum age of 65 years for the applicants.  
Be that as it may, since appointments in question of the 
VCs have already been made, as apprised by the law officer, the 
petitioner is at liberty to exercise his right to information before 
the concerned forum in accordance with law and assail any such 
appointment on specific grounds depicting violation of any 
provision of law or the applicable policy while impleading the 
Vice Chancellor concerned. No room for a roving inquiry or 
fishing expedition can be made available to the petitioner in the 
instant case4.            
11. 
The allocation of points of PhD degrees in the 
shortlisting criteria, annexed with the parawise comments filed 
by respondents No.1 & 2, are as under: - 
 PhD from the top 100 QS ranked universities of the 
world:  
35 Points 
 PhD from the top 101-300 QS ranked universities of 
the world: 
33 points 
 PhD from the top 301-500 QS ranked universities of 
the world: 
31 points 
 PhD from an HEC recognized or UNESCO listed 
institution:  29 points 
 
Note: The most current, publicly available QS 
Ranking will be referred to while allocating points. 
 
12. 
 The second prayer in this petition is regarding alleged 
discriminatory selection criteria vis-à-vis award of different 
numbers to local PhD degree holders and foreign degree holders. 
It is noted that advertisement for appointments in question was 
published on 01.06.2024 and last date for submission of the 
applications was 24.06.2024 and he applied for the said post but 
when he was not called for the interview, he filed this 
constitutional petition on 04.09.2024 challenging the selection 
                                                 
4 Commissioner Inland Revenue v. MCB Bank Limited (2021 PTD 1325) 

6 
W.P.No.52354 of 2024 
criteria. The petitioner ought to have challenged the selection 
criteria notified by the Government before applying for the post 
in question and not after having been rejected. In the absence of 
such timely challenge, it can be presumed that he accepted the 
criteria to be valid and expressed no reservation against it. It is 
equally well settled that the selection criteria generally reflects a 
policy decision of the provincial government.  In the absence of 
any violation of constitutional guarantee or patent illegality, 
such policy decision cannot be annulled by this Court in the 
exercise of writ jurisdiction5. However, validity of the criteria 
has been assailed here for alleged violation of Article 25 of the 
Constitution and the rules of acquiescence, waiver and estoppel 
do not stand in the way of constitutional guarantees6, thus it 
would be appropriate to adjudicate upon the challenge.  
13. 
The appropriate approach to Article 25 of the 
Constitution is well settled and reference needs only be made to 
one of the leading cases, I. A. Sharwani and others v. 
Government of Pakistan through Secretary Finance Division 
Islamabad and others7 wherein following principles of law 
governing operation of Article 25 have been set out:  
(i)   that equal protection of law does not envisage that every 
citizen is to be treated alike in all circumstances, but it 
contemplates that persons similarly situated or similarly 
placed are to be treated alike; 
 
(ii)   that reasonable classification is permissible but it must 
be founded on reasonable distinction or reasonable basis; 
 
(iii) that different laws can validly be enacted for different 
sexes, persons in different age groups, persons having 
different financial standings, and persons accused of heinous 
crimes; 
 
(iv) that no standard of universal application to test 
reasonableness of a classification can be laid down as what 
may be reasonable classification in a particular set of

circumstances, may be unreasonable in other set of 
circumstances; 
 
(v)   that a law applying to one person or one class of persons 
may be constitutionally valid if there is sufficient basis or 
reason for it, but a classification which is arbitrary and is not 
founded on any rational basis is no classification as to 
warrant its exclusion from the mischief of Article 25; 
 
(vi) that equal protection of law means that all persons 
equally placed be treated alike both in privileges conferred 
and liabilities imposed; 
 
(vii) that in order to make a classification reasonable, it 
should be based-- 
(a)   on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons 
or things that are grouped together from those who have been 
left out; 
(b) that the differentia must have rational nexus to the object 
sought to be achieved by such classification.” 
 
14. 
It is thus abundantly clear that Article 25 of the 
Constitution allows for reasonable classification based on 
intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that 
are grouped together from those who have been left out and such 
differentia must have a rational nexus to the object sought to be 
achieved. To resolve the controversy in hand, one must ask 
whether the criteria of allocating 29 marks to PhD degree 
holders from HEC recognized or UNESCO listed institutions 
against assignment of up to 35 marks to foreign PhD degree 
holders from top 500 QS ranked universities of the world is 
based on intelligible differentia and, if so, does it have rational 
nexus with object sought to be achieved?  
15. 
Vice Chancellor is the principal executive and academic 
officer of the University who is required to promote teaching, 
research 
and 
publications 
besides 
ensuring 
excellent 
administration of the University. The requirement of having 
earned PhD degree from an HEC recognized or UNESCO listed 
institution has been made mandatory for position of the Vice 
Chancellor. It is one of the indicators revealing academic 
excellence of such applicants. UNESCO is the only United 

8 
W.P.No.52354 of 2024 
Nations agency with a mandate in higher education and works 
with countries to ensure high quality higher education 
opportunities are available to everyone and for that purpose, it 
claims to place a special focus on inclusion, the recognition of 
qualifications and quality assurance, particularly in developing 
countries. Higher Education Commission of Pakistan, on the 
other hand, is a statutory organization established by the Federal 
Government, inter alia, to fund, oversee regulate and accredit 
the higher education endeavours in Pakistan. Applicants for the 
positions of VCs have earned their PhDs from a wide range of 
universities all of which do not possess identical quality and 
standards of excellence. While the requirement of PhD degree 
from an HEC recognized or UNESCO listed institution is meant 
to satisfy an eligibility requirement for appointment of VCs, it 
provides no basis to differentiate excellence amongst such 
institutions. QS World University Rankings is one of the most 
widely recognized and used systems of rankings to compare 
excellence of universities on the basis of certain well-defined 
indicators such as academic reputation, employer reputation, 
faculty/student ratio, citations per faculty, international students’ 
ratio, international faculty ratio. These indicators provide 
reasonable basis for classification of excellence amongst the 
institutions for the purpose of appointing VCs. It can be 
legitimately expected that the VCs who have earned their PhD 
degrees from the top ranked institutions of the world shall, while 
benefitting from their rich international exposure, endeavour to 
promote such excellence in the institutions headed by them. 
Therefore, the impugned selection criteria is not arbitrary and 
discriminatory but based on rational nexus with the object of 
classification.  
16. 
Undoubtedly, in the capitalist world we are part of, 
economic disparity and unequal distribution of wealth is a 
reality.  In the state of Pakistan, adherence to the capitalism is 

9 
W.P.No.52354 of 2024 
evident from the citizens’ fundamental rights to acquire, hold, 
dispose of property and protection against acquisition of 
property by the state8 as well as the freedom of trade, business or 
profession9, as guaranteed by the Constitution.   However, 
various labour laws were enacted in Pakistan in 1960s and 1970s 
acknowledging some rights of workers arguably in response to 
the threat posed by the communist movement at international 
level.  Pakistan remains a state closer to the right-of-centre. 
Societies in such states, by and large, remain divided by poverty 
and wealth.  Pakistan is not a communist state and Judges in this 
country neither have the constitutional mandate nor the capacity 
to change it that way.  It is perhaps for this reason that the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan, in the case of I. A. Sherwani 
enunciated the principle that discrimination on the basis of 
reasonable classification was permissible under Article 25 of the 
Constitution and that different laws could validly be enacted for 
persons having different financial standings, etc10. At best, what 
Judges of the constitutional Courts can do, while dispensing 
justice, is to mitigate harshness and miseries of the people to the 
extent permitted by the Constitution11.   
17. 
It is disturbing to note that for many in the homeland, 
access to even primary education is a far-fetched dream. It is no 
brainer that there can be no progress in any society without its 
human resource development and access to education is the key 
for that. Notwithstanding constitutional guarantee qua free and 
compulsory education for all children between the ages of 5 to 
16 years, more than 22.8 million children are out of schools in 
this country, representing 44% of population in that age group12. 
The state has fallen apart in fulfillment of her commitment to 
impart free and compulsory education to all such children.  At

10 
W.P.No.52354 of 2024 
systems level, inadequate financing, limited enforcement of 
policy commitments and challenges in equitable implementation 
impede reaching the most disadvantaged13.  In such conditions, 
pursuit of higher education in Pakistan is nothing short of a 
luxury for a common citizen.  Even after a degree in higher 
education is earned, the same does not guarantee employment. 
Amongst others, this is largely on account of mediocre standards 
of education. Be that as it may, amidst meager resources 
allocated by the state for imparting higher education, availability 
of the VCs possessing extra-ordinary qualifications, experience 
and publications from well-reputed universities and centres of 
excellence in the world is nothing short of a blessing and the 
same is vital for the advancement of quality and standards of 
education in the public sector universities.  Such measures can 
seriously contribute to overcome mediocrity so that ultimately 
the students and faculties may fully benefit therefrom.  
18. 
Any allegation of discrimination on the basis of inability 
of a student to fund higher education is indeed a direct attack on 
the top universities of the world to perpetuate inequality in the 
field of education, research and excellence.  Be that as it may, it 
is a common knowledge that PhD programs offered by top 
ranked universities in the world are mostly funded by such 
institutions or other organizations who offer scholarships and or 
financial aid to deserving applicants. No doubt such scholarships 
or financial aid is granted on competitive basis, however, top 
universities in the world are fairly mindful of their reputation in 
that regard.  Thus, plea of the petitioner that PhD degrees from 
top QS ranked universities are only available to those fortunate 
ones who possess financial resources to pursue education abroad 
cannot be readily accepted.  In any event, for being based on 
reasonable classification having nexus with the object, as fully

accordingly dismissed.
