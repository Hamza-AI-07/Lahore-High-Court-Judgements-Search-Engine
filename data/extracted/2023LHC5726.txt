Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:-  Through this civil revision 
the petitioners have challenged the validity of the judgment & 
decree dated 23.02.2016 passed by the learned Civil Judge, 
Sialkot who decreed the suit for declaration with possession and 
mandatory injunction filed by the respondents and also assailed 
the judgment & decree dated 11.07.2017 passed by the learned 
Additional District Judge, Sialkot who dismissed the appeal of 
the petitioners.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that the respondents/plaintiffs 
filed a suit for declaration with possession and mandatory 
injunction against the petitioners/defendants on 03.09.2008 and 
contended that suit land measuring 166 Kanal 03 Marla bearing 
Khewat No.1 Khasra Nos.44, 45, 46, 79, 80, 81, 83, 82, 85, 86,

subcontinent in 1947, said non-Muslim (mortgagors/owners) 
migrated to India and the rights of mortgagors were transferred in 
favour of Settlement Department. That the respondents/plaintiffs 
No.1 & 2 filed a suit in 1979 against the Settlement Department 
which was ex-parte decreed on 08.06.1982 by declaring the 
respondents/plaintiffs as owners-in-possession of the suit 
property due to expiry of period of 60 years. The Forest 
Department 
filed 
an 
application 
before 
the 
Deputy 
Commissioner, Sialkot for mutation of the land measuring 684 
Acre of Baila Be-Charagh which was allowed and subsequently 
mutation No.131 dated 03.05.2001 was entered in favour of 
Forest Department on the basis of a notification dated 
26.12.1951. The respondents/plaintiffs were not made party in the 
aforesaid application of Forest Department upon which the 
respondents/plaintiffs filed an application for review of the 
mutation.  The Deputy Commissioner Sialkot vide order dated 
21.08.2007 again declared that the suit land belonged to Forest 
Department. The respondents/plaintiffs filed an appeal which was 
dismissed by the Executive District Officer (Revenue), Sialkot 
vide 
order 
dated 
18.06.2008. 
The 
respondents/plaintiffs 
challenged the notification dated 26.12.1951 as well as orders 
dated 03.05.2001, 21.08.2007 and 18.06.2008 through the suit. 
  
The 
petitioners/defendants 
filed 
contested 
written 
statement and contended that the land measuring 684 Acre was 
allocated to the Forest Department by the Custodian of the 
Evacuee Property vide order dated 10.02.1948 and possession 
was also handed over. The notification dated 20.12.1951, which 
was duly issued, whereby the land is owned by the Forest 
Department. That on 27.02.1965 Chief Settlement Commissioner, 
West Pakistan issued notification that from that date, no land 
allotted/un-allotted which is in possession of Forest Department 
will be allotted against any claim. Subsequently, Chief Settlement 

 
C.R.No.115655/2017

Commissioner vide meeting dated 29.06.1965 sold the suit land 
as well as other similar lands to the Forest Department at the rate 
of Rs.14/- PIU. The Forest Department paid the consideration and 
in this way, the Forest Department became the exclusive owner 
of the suit land. That the Senior Member, Board of Revenue 
issued order 04.10.1979 for transfer of the suit property from 
Settlement 
Department 
to 
the 
Forest 
Department 
and 
subsequently, vide order dated 04.12.1979, direction was passed 
in this regard to mutate the suit land in favour of Forest 
Department. The respondents/defendants further contended that a 
group of fraudulent persons including the respondents/plaintiffs 
trying to illegally got allotment of the suit land. That one 
Muhammad Siddique filed Mukhbari application upon which 
Deputy Commissioner Sialkot vide order 07.03.1982 passed 
order for review/rectification of mutation Nos.4 to 16, 20 to 24, 
37, 38 to 43. The said order dated was assailed in an appeal 
before the Commissioner, Gujranwala Division which was 
accepted on 27.03.1985 and the case was remanded to the Deputy 
Commissioner Sialkot. Haji Abdul Karim filed Writ Petition 
No.189-R/1987 wherein vide order dated 09.021992, the matter 
was also remanded to the Deputy Commissioner, Sialkot for fresh 
decision. In these post-remand proceedings, the Deputy 
Commissioner, Sialkot vide order dated 28.02.2001 declared that 
the suit land is owned by the Forest Department and in the light 
of said order, Mutation Nos.131 and 132 dated 03.05.2001 were 
entered and sanctioned. The order dated 28.02.2001 as well as 
mutations 
No.131 
& 
132 
were 
challenged 
by 
the 
respondents/plaintiffs and others before the Executive District 
Officer (Revenue) Sialkot and review only to the extent of 
Muslim owners was accepted but to the extent of ownership of 
the suit land by the Forest Department, the same was dismissed.

Out of the divergent pleadings of the parties, the trial 
Court framed issues, recorded pro and contra evidence of the 
parties and finally decreed the suit vide judgment & decree dated 
23.02.2016. Being dejected, the petitioners filed an appeal which 
was dismissed by the appellate Court vide judgment & decree 
dated 11.07.2017. Hence, this civil revision.   
3. 
I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have 
gone through the record. 
4. 
The core controversy involved in this case revolves 
around Issues No.1 & 2 which are reproduced as under: 
 “1. Whether the plaintiffs are owners of suit property and 
orders dated 28.02.2001, 21.08.2007 & 18.06.2008 are illegal, 
void, against the facts, based on malafide and liable to be 
cancelled? OPP 
2.  If above issue is proved in affirmative, whether the 
plaintiffs are entitled to get the possession of the suit property 
and get incorporate their names in the revenue record as 
owners? OPP” 
To dislodge the onus, Sh. Allah Ditta (P.W.1) deposed that they 
are in possession of land measuring 166 Kanal 03 Marla situated 
in Moza Baila Be-Charagh Tehsil & District Sialkot for more 
than 100 years from their predecessors as the non-Muslim had 
mortgaged the same; that the suit land was in the name of non-
Muslims who migrated to India; that they filed suit in 1979 which 
was decreed in their favour on 08.06.1982; that on the application 
of the Forest Department, the Deputy Commissioner transferred 
the land measuring 684 Acre of Moza Baila Be-Charagh to Forest 
Department but the plaintiffs were not impleaded in the said 
proceedings; that the Deputy Commissioner Sialkot vide order 
dated 28.02.2001 declared that the suit land is owned by the 
Forest Department and mutation No.131 was sanctioned in favour 
of Forest Department; that the District Officer (Revenue) while 
deciding the review application declared that the suit land            

 
C.R.No.115655/2017

is owned by the Forest Department; that they filed appeal which 
was dismissed by the Executive District Officer (Revenue); that 
the order of Deputy Commissioner, Sialkot, District Officer 
(Revenue) Sialkot and Executive District Officer (Revenue) 
Sialkot are liable to be set aside; that a decree was passed by 
Civil Court in their favour. During cross examination, he deposed 
that:

that:

Sialkot; that the Forest Department is owner of land measuring 
684 Acre which land was given to it by Settlement Department 
on 10.02.1948; that the Settlement Department issued notification 
dated 20.12.1958 and thereafter Chief Settlement Commissioner 
also issued notification 27.02.1965 declaring the Forest 
Department as owner of any allotted/unallotted land which is 
under its possession and also declared that such land could not 
adjusted against any claim; that the Forest Department paid 
consideration of the entire suit land at the rate of Rs.14/- PIU 
through cheques and on 04.10.1979 the Board of Revenue, 
Lahore acknowledged the receipt of payment of entire 
consideration amount of the suit land thus proprietary rights were 
granted in favour of the Forest Department and accordingly order 
dated 04.12.1979 was issued; that later on a few fraudulent 
persons got alienated some portions of land in their favour; that 
Muhammad 
Siddique 
filed 
application 
before 
Deputy 
Commissioner, Sialkot upon which Deputy Commissioner 
cancelled the said allotment orders; that appeal was filed before 
Commissioner which was allowed and the case was remanded to 
the Deputy Commissioner, Sialkot; that thereafter Deputy 
Commissioner , Sialkot vide order dated 08.02.2001 resumed 
land and mutation No.132 was sanctioned in favour of Forest 
Department. Imtiaz-ul-Hassan, Incharge Litigation Branch, Forest 
Department Sialkot (D.W.2) deposed in line with the statement 
made by the D.W.1. Despite lengthy cross examination the stance 
of the witnesses could not be shattered by the other side.  
6. 
The respondents/plaintiffs challenged the orders dated 
28.02.2001, 21.08.2007 and 18.06.2008 passed by the Deputy 
Commissioner, District Officer (Revenue) and Executive  
District Officer (Revenue) Sialkot respectively but the said orders 
were not produced in evidence by them, whereas, the  

 
C.R.No.115655/2017 
 
7
said orders were upheld by this Court while dismissing Writ 
Petition No.95975/2017 vide order dated 06.04.2021.  
7.  
The Deputy Commissioner, Sialkot after considering all 
the submission of the respondents/plaintiffs, declared that the suit 
land was transferred in favour of Forest Department by the 
Settlement Department and on the basis of notification 
10.02.1948, Forest Department is in possession of the same. The 
Deputy Commissioner, Sialkot observed in order dated 
28.02.2001 that the land of Moza Baila Be-Charagh Tehsil 
Sialkot, including the suit land, is owned by the Forest 
Department. For reference, relevant portion of the order dated 
28.02.2001 is reproduced as under: 
 “9. In view of above discussion advanced by both the parties I 
hold that the Forest Department was in possession of the land 
after having paid the price to the Central Govt. and 
inadvertently, during Consolidation/Settlement operations in 
the District, the mutation was not incorporated in the revenue 
record, and the land was wrongly and illegally allotted to the 
other persons who transferred the same through registered sale 
deeds and mutations. The application for Q.P.R allotment was 
filed on 05.07.1974 whereas the Settlement act was repealed 
on 30.06.1974, which was time barred, and no RL.II. for Bela-
Be-Chiragh was made. Under these circumstances, the bogus 
mutations are hereby ordered to be annulled and mutations in 
respect of the land measuring 684 Acres, as per notification, is 
ordered to be attested and sanctioned in favour of the Forest 
Department.” 
 
8. 
The respondents/plaintiffs challenged the said order 
through an appeal before the Executive District Officer 
(Revenue) which was dismissed vide order dated 18.06.2008. The 
respondents/plaintiffs did not assail the said order before the 
Board of Revenue, Punjab as such to the extent of respondents/ 
plaintiffs the said orders have attained the status of finality and 
have become past and closed transaction. Reliance is placed on 
Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Vs. Aziz ur Rehman 
Chaudhary and another (2016 SCMR 14).

9.  
However, one Muhammad Siddique assailed the orders 
dated 28.02.2001 and 18.06.2008 through a revision before the 
Board of Revenue wherein the respondents/plaintiffs were a 
party. The Member, Board of Revenue vide order dated 
26.12.2016 upheld the orders of Deputy Commissioner, Sialkot 
as well as of Executive District Officer (Revenue). Muhammad 
Siddique assailed the aforesaid orders through Writ Petition 
[No.95975/2017] which was dismissed by this Court vide order 
dated 06.04.2021. For ready reference, relevant portion of order 
dated 06.04.2021 is reproduced as under: 
 “4.

Vide Notification [No.4403-D(F)] dated 20.12.1951 possession 
of the said land was taken over by Forest Department which 
remained paying the land revenue of the said land since 1951-52 
to 1962-63. With regard to the Land of Forest Department, the 
Chief Settlement Commissioner vide Notification No.65/795-
R(L) dated 27.02.1965 directed all the Deputy Commissioners 
etc. to restrain themselves from making allotment of land 
notified or otherwise which was under the possession of the 
Forest Department to any evacuee claimant and its character 
could not be changed. For ready reference, gist of notification 
dated 27.02.1965 is as under:- 
 
“Subject: Disposal of evacuee land in possession of the 
Forest Department. 
 
On the representation of the Forest Department, it 
has been decided by the Chief Settlement Commissioner 
that evacuee land in possession of the Forest Department 
whether notified or unnotified should not be allotted 
against claim under the provision of the West Pakistan 
Rehabilitation Settlement Scheme till further orders. 
2. 
The Forest Department is collecting details of 
forest plantations on evacuee land. The Tehsildars and the 
Patwaris concerned should be directed to fully co-operate 
with the Forest Department to preparing complete details 
of the evacuee lands and make available the requisite 
records has been required.”   

 
C.R.No.115655/2017

The vires of above notification dated 27.02.1965 was validated 
by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment titled 
as Province of Punjab Vs Muhammad Mahmood Shah (1991 
SCMR 1426). Further in a judgment titled as Masooda Begum 
through Legal Heirs Vs Govt. of Punjab through Secretary 
Forest, Lahore & 9 Others (PLD 2003 SC 90), the Hon’ble 
Apex Court has observed as under:- 
“The learned counsel for the Forest Department when 
confronted with the above legal position, he candidly 
conceded that the allotments which were made prior to 
27.02.1965, would be protected by the law laid down by 
this Court in the judgments referred above and that the 
judgment of the High Court by virtue of which the order 
of cancellation of allotment of the vendor of present 
appellants, was declared illegal was upheld in Civil 
Petitions Nos.1982 and 1983 of 1996 on the basis of law 
laid down by this Court in (1991 SCMR 1426), according 
to which the rights of the allottees of the land prior to 
27.02.1965 were protected and conclusively determined”.  
In the aforesaid pronouncements, it has been declared that any 
order passed regarding the allotment of land belonging to Forest 
Department after 27.02.1965 would not hold field and such 
order would be considered as violative to the notification dated 
27.02.1965, issued by the Chief Settlement Commissioner 
whereby a complete embargo was placed on allotment of land in 
possession of forest department against any claims under the 
provision of the West Pakistan Rehabilitation Settlement 
Scheme. In another judgment cited as Province of the Punjab 
through Collector, Sheikhupura and others Vs. Syed Ghazanfar 
Ali Shah and others (2017 SCMR 172), the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan while dealing with similar situation observed 
as under:- 
 
“13. 
Let us pause here for a while to see where did the 
memorandum dated 27.02.1965 come from and what did 
it stand for? This memorandum was issued by the Chief 
Settlement Commissioner under paragraph 4-A of the 
Rehabilitation Settlement Scheme, who had the power to 
exclude land from allotment where it was required for 
public purpose. The memorandum provided as under:- 
“On the representation of Forest Department it 
has been decided by the Chief Settlement 
Commissioner that evacuee lands in possession 
of the Forest Department whether notified or un-
notified should not be allotted against claims 
under the provision of the West Pakistan 
Rehabilitation Settlement Scheme till further 
orders.” 
The memorandum reproduced above provides that 
evacuee land in possession of the Forest Department 
whether notified or un-notified could not be allotted 
against claims under the provisions of the West Pakistan 

 
C.R.No.115655/2017 
 
11
Rehabilitation Settlement Scheme, till further orders. 
Additional Settlement Commissioner or any other Officer 
in the hierarchy being subordinate to the Chief Settlement 
Commissioner could not nullify or neutralize its effect 
unless, of course, ordered otherwise by the Chief 
Settlement Commissioner himself. It does not give any 
power or authority even to the Forest Department to 
nullify or neutralize its effect, or read something in it 
what is not there. Allottee, too, could not ask for 
allotment of land on the condition of managing its 
retrieval from the Forest Department on his own when he 
does not figure anywhere in the scheme of the 
memorandum. We do not understand what prevailed on 
the Additional Commissioner to confirm allotment on the 
undertaking of the respondents or on the basis of NOC of 
the Forest Department, if at all it is assumed to have any 
existence, outside the record, when the memorandum 
does not provide for either of them. We thus hold that the 
allotment confirmed in derogation of memorandum dated 
27.02.1965 cannot hold good. In the case of Muhammad 
Ayub and other V. The Province of Punjab (supra) this 
Court while dealing with an identical issue held as under:-
 
 
“The suit was dismissed by the learned trial 
Court observing “that the plaintiffs never got 
possession and that many trees have been grown 
up there in the supervision of the Forest 
Department” and, therefore, the claim of the 
petitioners that they were in possession which 
was allegedly interfered with by the Forest 
Department, was not well founded. It was also 
held on account of Memorandum No.65/775-RL 
dated 27.2.1965 from the Chief Settlement 
Commissioner 
Lahore 
to 
the 
Deputy 
Commissioners, 
Sialkot, 
Gujranwala, 
Sheikhupura, Gujrat Rawalpindi, Jhelum and 
Attock on the subject of “disposal of evacuee 
land in possession of Forest Department” which 
was to the effect that evacuee lands in 
possession of the Forest Department whether 
notified or unnoticed were not to be allotted 
against any claim under the provisions of the 
West Pakistan Rehabilitation Settlement Scheme, 
the allotment of this land in favour of 
Muhammad Din on 1.3.1966 against his verified 
claim was itself not valid and the subsequent 
sale of this land in favour of the petitioners did 
not confer any title on them. The aforesaid 
judgment and decree was upheld by the ,learned 
District Judge on appeal and again by the High 
Court on revision. Hence this petition for 
leave.” 
14. In the case of Province of Punjab V. Muhammad 
Mahmood Shah (supra) the same view was restated with 

 
C.R.No.115655/2017 
 
12
much greater clarity and emphasis in the paragraph which 
reads as under:- 
“9. Under paragraph 4-A of the Rehabilitation 
Settlement 
Scheme, 
the 
Chief 
Settlement 
Commissioner had the power to direct the 
exclusion of land from allotment where it was 
required for a public purpose. While so 
excluding by his directive dated 27.2.1965, the 
Chief Settlement Commissioner was acting 
within his lawful authority. The High Court, 
however, did not approve of it in a case (Civil 
Appeal No.155 of 1983) where the allotment had 
been made for the first time on 18.4.1968, by 
observing as hereunder— 
“The main ground on which the Settlement 
Commissioner set aside the allotment of the 
petitioners was the order of the Chief Settlement 
Commissioner dated 27.2.1965 mentioned above 
restraining the district authorities from allotting 
such lands as were in possession of the Forest 
Department. The copy of the Jamabandi for the 
year 
1905-66, 
however, 
shows 
that 
the 
possession over some of the land in question at 
that time was that of the petitioners but he did 
not go into the same. In any case it has recently 
been held by a Division Bench of this Court in 
Inayat 
Bibi 
etc. 
v. 
Assistant 
Settlement 
Commissioner 
and 
Chief 
Settlement 
Commissioner PLD 1978 Lah. 252 that the 
Chief Settlement Commissioner could not issue 
such 
instructions 
restraining 
statutory 
functionaries to allot land agains the claims. 
The letter dated 27th February, 1965 is thus 
without lawful authority and of no legal effect:” 
Another paragraph which is extremely relevant in 
this behalf also merits a look and thus reads as under:- 
10. 
The decision referred to and relied 
upon for recording the above findings related to 
absolute 
prohibition 
against 
making 
the 
allotments and not qualified prohibition as is 
contained 
in 
paragraph 
4-A 
of 
the 
Rehabilitation Settlement Scheme. Hence the 
very basis for the decision is incorrect. In a 
decision of this Court in Muhammad Auyb and 
others v. The Province of Punjab  (1989 SCMR 
1033), the allotments made on 1.3.1966 were 
held to be violative of the directive of the Chief 
Settlement Commissioner dated 27.2.1965. The 
law point involved in all these cases has 
received an authoritative pronouncement in 
Mian Rafi ud Din and 3 others V. The Chief 
Settlement and Rehabilitation Commissioner 

 
C.R.No.115655/2017 
 
13
and 2 others (PLD 1971 SC 252) in the 
following words:- 
“It is necessary in my view to keep in mind that 
there is a distinction between the right to claim a 
transfer and the right to the transfer and the 
right to the transference of the property itself. 
The provisions of the Schedule indicated the 
persons or the category of persons who can 
claim the transfer of a particular property but 
the right to the transfer of the property accrues 
or becomes vested only after a final order for 
such transfer has been made in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act itself, the Schemes, the 
rules framed under the Act and the instructions 
from time to time issued. Until a final order of 
transfer has been made it cannot be said that the 
property has been disposed of and is no longer 
available for transfer. It is only when a property 
is no longer available for transfer that an order 
of the Central Government laying down a 
different mode of disposal will not affect it, on 
the principle that change in the mode of transfer 
cannot reopen a past and closed transaction.”  
5. 
Admittedly vide letter dated 10.02.1948 the land in 
question was reserved for forestation and notification dated 
20.12.1951 shows the possession of the Forest Department over 
the said land. The Government of West Pakistan accorded 
sanction on 20.07.1965 to purchase the said area alongwith other 
areas for the forestation against payment of sale consideration 
which (consideration) was paid through cheques during the year 
1970 and 1974 by the Forest department to the settlement 
department and said land by all intent and purpose vested in the 
absolute ownership of the Forest Department and was not 
available for any other allotment under any scheme of 
rehabilitation framed under settlement law. But in contravention 
of the above notification the land measuring 3320-Kanals 11-
Marlas out of abovementioned land of forest department was got 
allotted during consolidation proceedings by one Naik 
Muhammad in the year 1973. Against the said allotment Mst. 
Zainab Bibi and others filed Mukhbari application to the 
settlement department and after hearing the parties, the allotment 
in the name of Naik Muhammad was cancelled but the said 
resumed land was transferred through mutations No.4 to 10, 13 
to 17, 20 to 24, 34, 37 to 43 to the different evacuee claimants.  
 
6. 
Petitioner filed petition on 25.10.1981 before the 
Assistant Commissioner, Sialkot seeking cancellation of 
mutation Nos.34, 37 to 43 of village Bela Bay Chiragh on the 
ground that he purchased the suit land from Muslim owner, as 
such, the said land could not be made part of the settlement pool. 
The District Collector after holding inquiry vide order dated 

 
C.R.No.115655/2017 
 
14
07.03.1982 allowed the review of mutation Nos.4 to 10, 13 to 
17, 20 to 24, 34, 37 to 43. The effectees of above order namely 
Haji Abdul Kareem and Haji Muhammad Yousaf etc. filed an 
appeal before the Addl. Commissioner (Revenue), Gujranwala 
who after hearing the parties remanded the matter on 27.03.1985 
to the District Collector/Collector, Sialkot for decision afresh. 
Against the said order, a Writ Petition No.189-R/1987 was filed 
and this Court upheld the order of the Addl. Commissioner 
(Revenue), Gujranwala whereafter in post-remand proceedings, 
the District Collector, Sialkot vide order dated 28.02.2001 
resumed the land and in compliance of above order, the Revenue 
Officer sanctioned mutation No.131 of land measuring 684-
acres in the name of Provincial Government and through another 
mutation No.132 the above said land was transferred in favour 
of the Forest Department on 03.05.2001.  
 
Against the said order dated 28.02.2001 as well as 
mutation Nos.131 & 132 dated 03.05.2001, Mian Anwar 
Shahzad etc. as well as the present petitioner claiming to be 
purchaser of the land, the Muslim is owner before partition of 
India filed review petition before the District Officer 
(Revenue)/Collector, Sialkot who ordered the review of the 
mutation No.132 to the extent of Muslim property as per their 
entitlement and rejected the application of the petitioner vide 
order dated 21.08.2007 and in compliance of above order 
mutation No.133 was accordingly attested in favour of Muslim 
owners on 25.08.2008. The above order of the District Officer 
(Revenue) remained upheld upto the level of Member Board of 
Revenue. As per record the Muslim property was excluded vide 
mutation No.133 dated 25.10.2008 whereafter no such land was 
in the possession of forest department. Moreover, admittedly, 
notification dated 20th December, 1951 issued by the Governor 
of West Pakistan in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 
38 of the Forest Act, 1927 which is still in field as the same has 
not been reversed by any competent forum. Even otherwise, a 
period of many decades have been elapsed and proceeding of 
conferment of ownership to the Forest Department has attained 
the status of past and closed transaction which could not be re-
opened at the whims and caprice of any indolent party.  
 
7. 
Furthermore, the Board of Revenue issued circular dated 
26.07.1980 addressed to all the Deputy Commissioners/Addl. 
Settlement Commissioners (Lands) in the Punjab to cancel the 
allotments of the land of Forest Department. For ready 
reference, Para-4 circular whereof is reproduced as under:- 
 
“Sizeable portion of the land purchased by or transferred 
to the Forest Department as protected forest has been 
allotted on forged and fabricated documents or anti dated 
Khatas have been prepared in respect thereof. The Forest 
Department has filed Mukhbari application in respect of 
the forgery and fraud coming to their notice upto 30-06-

 
C.R.No.115655/2017 
 
15
1974, but there are still many cases which have come to 
the notice of the repeal of the Evacuee Laws with effect 
from 01.07.1974 or which may come to your notice or the 
Forest Department in due course of time. Since fraud is 
fraud and it vitiates all solemn proceedings and there is no 
limitation of time for interfering in cases of forgery and 
fraud and further that orders obtained on the basis of 
forgery and fabricated documents etc. are nullity in the 
eyes of law and they can be ignored straight-away as non-
existent.”   
 
10.  
Moreover, all the documentary evidence (Exh.P.1 to 
Exh.P.12) was produced on behalf of the respondents/plaintiffs 
by their counsel in his statement whereas it is mandatory 
requirement of law that documents relied upon should be 
produced in the evidence by party in its own statement so that the 
adverse party may have a fair opportunity to cross-examine the 
same, as such the documents produced by the respondents 
counsel lack intrinsic value and such documents can validly be 
excluded from consideration. Reliance is placed on the case title 
Mst. Akhtar Sultana Vs. Major Retd. Muzaffar Khan Malik 
through his legal heirs and others (PLD 2021 SC 715). Similar 
view has been reiterated by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in its 
latest judgment cited as Rustam & Others Vs. Jehangir 
(deceased) through LRs. (2023 SCMR 730) wherein it is held as 
under:- 
“7. As regards the other two documents i.e. mutation No.1836 
(Exh.D-9) and mutation No.1837 (Exh.D-8), it is suffice to say that 
according to principle settled by this Court in the cases reported as 
Mst. Hameeda Begum and others v. Mst. Irshad Begum and others 
(2007 SCMR 996), Federation of Pakistan through Secretary 
Ministry of Defence and another v. Jaffar Khan and others (PLD 
2010 SC 604), Province of the Punjab through Collector, 
Sheikhupura and others v. Syed Ghazanfar Ali Shah and others (2017 
SCMR 172) the document should be produced in the evidence by the 
party itself and a fair opportunity should be given to the opposite 
party to cross-examine the same, as such, the said two documents 
produced by the defendants counsel in his statement could not be 
taken into consideration.”  
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)   

 
C.R.No.115655/2017

11. 
So far as the argument of learned counsel for the 
respondents/plaintiffs that the respondents/plaintiffs had obtained 
decree dated 08.06.1982 from the Civil Court against the 
Settlement Department is concerned, suffice it to say that vide 
notification dated 10.02.1948, the suit land had already been 
transferred in favour of the Forest Department but the 
respondents/plaintiffs did not array Forest Department as party/ 
defendant in the said suit whereas in the absence of a necessary 
party, no effective decree or order can be passed and even if 
passed that would have no binding force qua the party who was 
not party to the lis. Reliance in this regard is placed on cases cited 
as Mst. Maqbool Begum etc. Vs. Gullan & Others (PLD 1982 SC 
46) and Province of Punjab through Secretary Excise & Taxation 
Department, Lahore & Others Vs. Murree Brewery Company Ltd 
(MBCL) & Another (2021 SCMR 305).  
12. 
The respondents/plaintiffs claim that the suit land was 
mortgaged by the non-Muslim/evacuees to their predecessors, 
thus they became owners of the suit land on such basis. 
Admittedly, at the time of creation of Pakistan, the suit land was 
owned by non-Muslims who migrated to India and thus the suit 
land being the evacuee land vested with the Central Government 
and became part of the compensation pool. It is settled law that 
where a property, rightly or wrongly, treated to be an evacuee 
property, such treatment of property could only be assailed 
through proceedings before the Custodian of Evacuee Property. 
Reliance is placed on Member BOR Punjab and another Vs. Mst. 
Siddiqan through L.Rs. and others (2015 SCMR 1721), relevant 
portion whereof is reproduced as under:- 
“2……It is a settled principle of law that where a property is rightly 
or wrongly treated to be an evacuee property, such treatment of the 
property, can only be assailed through proceedings before the 
appropriate forum. In this case, the relevant law is the evacuee law 
and the competent forum created by such law namely, is the 
Custodian or his successor the Notified Officer. Reference is made 

 
C.R.No.115655/2017 
 
17
to Azizuddin v. Muhammad Ismail (1985 SCMR 666). Reference can 
be made to the judgment dated 1-10-2014 of this Court passed in 
Civil Appeal No.514/2008 titled "Nasir Fahimuddin and others v. 
Charles Philips Mills son of Patrick Mills, resident of 4/2-A, Habib 
Ullah Road, Lahore and others"; besides the law laid down in 
Muhammad Din and 8 others v. Province of the Punjab through 
Collector and others (PLD 2003 Lah. 441), the relevant portion 
whereof reads as under: 
"From the above, it stands settled that when there is a 
question about the evacuee nature and treatment of a property 
as such. the civil courts have no jurisdiction in the matter. In 
the instant case, not. only that the property was treated as an 
evacuee property, but, the same had also been transferred and 
permanently settled in favour of the predecessor-in-interest of 
the petitioners, Noor Muhammad, predecessor-in-interest of 
respondent No.3, and Nazim-„ud-Din. The Civil Courts in the ' 
suit, filed. by the respondents, seeking declaration of their title 
on the basis of PTD, issued in their favour, had no jurisdiction 
to hold such transfer as void, because the property was 
nonevacuee and, therefore. its treatment and transfer to the 
petitioners could not be made............Even if the property had 
been erroneously treated and transferred as evacuee, their 
right in the property, stood extinguished and they had no 
legitimate title, which could be passed onto Abdul Rashid by 
way of gift, from whom, respondents Nos.2 and 3 could 
acquire a lawful  title, by stepping into the shoes of the 
original owners ......... It has been settled till now that, where 
the “property had been treated and transferred‎ as an evacuee 
property; even if erroneously, and the non-evacuee owners did 
not seek their remedy under the law in force at the relevant 
time, their title to such property stood extinguished and they 
could not assert their right of ownership before the Civil 
Court, after the repeal of the evacuee/settlement law, on 
account of lack of jurisdiction." 
  
13. 
Moreover, 
the 
petitioners/defendants 
produced 
notification dated 10.02.1948 (Exh.D.1), notification dated 
20.12.1951 (Exh.D.2), receipt of the payment of land revenue 
(Exh.D3), 
notification 
dated 
27.02.1965 
(Exh.D.4), 
the 
proceedings of the meeting of Chief Settlement Commissioner 
(Exh.D.5), the certificate for payment of payment of 
consideration of the land (Exh.D.6), mutation No.132 (Exh.D.8), 
copies of Jamabandi for the year 2005-2006 (Exh.D.9) & 1961-
1962 (Exh.D.10) but the Courts below did not appreciate and 
discuss the aforesaid documentary evidence.  
14.  
The respondents/plaintiffs failed to prove their case 
through any trustworthy oral as well as documentary evidence, as 

 
C.R.No.115655/2017 
 
18
such the findings of both the Courts below on issues No.1 & 2 
being based on misreading and non-reading of evidence as well 
as against the record are hereby reversed and the same are 
decided against the respondents/plaintiffs and in favour of the 
petitioners/defendants. 
15. 
The Courts below have neither taken into consideration 
the evidence nor furnished any well-reasoned findings, as such, 
they have committed blatant misreading and non-reading of the 
evidence. The learned Courts below have also failed to apply the 
correct law which rendered the said dicta as not sustainable in the 
eyes of law and are liable to be set-aside. This Court, under 
Section 115 C.P.C, has jurisdiction to interfere in the perverse 
concurrent judgments & decrees of the lower fora. Reliance is 
placed on the case of Nazim-ud-Din & Others Vs. Sheikh Zia-Ul-
Qamar & Others (2016 SCMR 24).   
16. 
The land in question is admittedly a public asset and the 
Courts of law are custodian of the public properties, public 
interest and while dealing with matters relating to such 
properties/assets or interests, it is inalienable obligation of the 
courts to be very careful and cautious and assure itself to the 
extent of certainty that no foul is being played with the state 
assets. An extraordinary obligation is placed upon the courts to 
keep abreast itself with law and facts of the case and when certain 
material facts unearthed before it then the matter should be 
decided as per law even without being influenced by respective 
pleadings of the parties. In this regard, reliance is placed on a 
judgment cited as Provincial Government through Collector, 
Kohat and another Versus Shabbir Hussain (PLD 2005 SC 337), 
wherein the Hon’ble Apex Court of the country has held as 
under:- 
 
“12. Likewise, the learned Presiding Officers are also required to 
exercise caution when they are dealing with matters relating to 

 
C.R.No.115655/2017 
 
19
public property and public interest of which the Courts of law are 
the final custodians. It is true that we have never leaned in favour of 
giving of preferential treatment to the Government departments or 
agencies but then we are equally obliged, while granting relief, to 
ensure that public interest is not permitted to be jeopardized and 
public property is not allowed to be squandered through mere 
collusion of some representative of a Government agency”. 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
Further reliance is placed on cases cited as Al-shafique Housing 
Society Vs. P.M.A (PLD 1992 SC 113), Union Council Dhabeji 
Vs. Al-Noor Textile Mills Ltd (1993 SCMR 7), Multiline 
Associates Vs. Ardeshir Cowasjee (PLD 1995 SC 423), Abdul 
Haq Indher Vs. Province of Sindh (2007 SCMR 907), Taj 
Muhammad Vs. Town Committee (1994 CLC 2214) and Sindh 
Peoples Welfare Trust Vs. Government of Sindh (2005 CLC 
713). 
17.  
In view of above, this civil revision is allowed, the 
judgment & decree dated 23.02.2013 passed by the trial Court 
and the judgment & decree dated 11.07.2017 passed by the 
appellate Court are set aside and the suit for declaration with 
possession and mandatory injunction filed by the respondents/ 
plaintiffs is hereby dismissed. No order as to costs.
