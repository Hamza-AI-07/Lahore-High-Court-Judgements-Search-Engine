Date of hearing

Petitioner(s) by  
Mr. Shahid Mehmood Abbasi, ASC.  
Respondent(s) by 
Mirza Asif Abbas, Advocate. 
Mr. Arshad Mehmood Malik, Assistant 
Attorney General. 
 
  
JAWAD HASSAN, J. The petitioner namely Ghulam 
Shabbir through instant petition under Article 199 of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) calls in 
question the order dated 01.08.2023 passed by the Additional District 
Judge, Pind Dadan Khan, District Jhelum, whereby while dismissing 
civil revision of the petitioner, order dated 25.07.2023 passed by the 
learned Civil Judge, Class-I, Pind Dadan Khan, District Jhelum was 
affirmed.  
2. 
Precisely the facts necessary for adjudication of instant petition 
are that Respondent No.1 instituted a suit for recovery of maintenance 
allowance against her husband namely Abdul Khaliq, who is 
Respondent No.2 in the instant petition. The suit was ultimately 
decreed vide judgment and decree dated 01.04.2017. An execution 
petition was filed and during the proceedings Respondent No.2 was 
asked to pay the decretal amount but on his failure, he was sent to 
civil prison. The petitioner stood surety for the judgment debtor and 
submitted surety bond accordingly, however, on failure by the 
judgment debtor to satisfy the decree, proceedings were initiated 

W.P.Nos.2669 of 2023

against the Petitioner (surety) and due to non-fulfillment of his 
undertakings, he was sent to civil prison and his property was ordered 
to be attached through order dated 25.07.2023. This followed civil 
revision before the Additional District Judge, Pind Dadan Khan, 
District Jhelum but same was dismissed by way of order dated 
01.08.2023. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner inter alia contends that 
impugned orders are the result of mis-reading and non-reading of 
material available on record; that the Petitioner stood surety only for 
an amount of Rs.300,000/- which has already been paid by him 
before the Executing Court but instead of discharging him from 
responsibility, he was sent to civil prison for one year while his 
property was also attached; that the judgment debtor/Respondent 
No.2 has been released from the prison after serving out one year 
imprisonment thus he should satisfy the decree by paying the 
decretal amount and his property should have been attached instead 
of the Petitioner/surety. He relied on “AHMAD ALI and another 
versus Sheikh AMMAN ELAHI” (2015 CLC 1704), “SHAFQAT 
IBRAR versus JUDGE FAMILY COURT and another” (2014 MLD 
1809) and “Mirza SHAHID BRIG versus NATIONAL BANK OF 
PAKISTAN and 8 others” (2002 CLD 623). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for Respondents supports the 
impugned orders and contends that the Petitioner has undertaken to 
pay the decretal amount in the surety bond and has categorically and 
unequivocally stated before the Executing Court that he was 
responsible for the decretal amount, which was also recorded at the 
back of surety bond. He further contends that there is no ambiguity in 
the statement of the Petitioner/surety given before the Executing 
Court therefore, the impugned orders do not require any interference 
by this Court. He relied on “INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK 
OF PAKISTAN versus HYDERABAD BEVERAGE COMPANY 
PRIVATE LIMITED and others” (2016 SCMR 451), “RAFIQUE 
HAZQUEL MASIH versus BANK ALFALAH LTD. and others”  

W.P.Nos.2669 of 2023 
 
 3 
(2005 SCMR 72), “ZULFIQAR ALI and others versus LIAQAT ALI 
and others” (PLD 2020 Lahore 350), “MUHAMMAD AKRAM 
versus ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE and 5 others” (2023 CLC 
702) and “KHADIM HUSSAIN versus MUHAMMAD TARIQ and 
others” (2021 CLC 805).   
5. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties 
and perused the record.  
6. 
It is an admitted position on the record that suit instituted by 
the Respondent No.1 for the recovery of maintenance allowance was 
decreed by way of judgment dated 01.04.2017. In execution 
proceedings, the judgment debtor (Respondent No.2) paid certain 
amounts on different dates however, on account of failure to pay, he 
was sent to civil prison for one year vide order dated 04.07.2022. 
Thereafter, the proceedings were initiated against the Petitioner/surety 
for satisfaction of the decree but he raised an objection that he had 
bound himself only to the extent of Rs.3,00,000/- which he has 
already paid and as such he is not liable to pay any further amount. 
The said objection had already been turned down by the executing 
Court vide order dated 24.02.2023 and thereafter, due to non-payment 
of decretal amount, the Petitioner/surety was sent to civil prison for 
one year and his property was also attached vide order dated 
25.07.2023. Admittedly, the Petitioner stood surety for the judgment 
debtor/Respondent No.2 and submitted a surety bond to this effect, 
which is available at page No.21 of the instant petition. The relevant 
extract from the said surety bond/undertaking is reproduced below:

7. 
It is quite obvious from the contents of above said undertaking 
that he himself bound to pay the decretal amount in case of default of 
the judgment debtor. His statement to this effect is also recorded on 
the back side of above said surety bond which reads as: 
 
 
8. 
From the above, it is manifestly clear that while submitting 
surety bond, the Petitioner has undertaken to satisfy the decree if the 
judgment debtor fails to satisfy the same and he had no objection on 
selling, auction or attachment of his property for the satisfaction of the 
decree. Section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 deals with 
the proposition in hand which reads as under: 
“145. Enforcement of liability of surety. – 
Where any person has become liable as surety– 
(a) for the performance of any decree or any part 
thereof, or 
(b) for the restitution of any property taken in 
execution of a decree, or 
(c) for the payment of any money, or for the 
fulfilment of any condition imposed on any 
person, under an Order of the Court in any suit 
or in any proceeding consequent thereon, the 
decree or order may be executed against him, to 
the extent to which he has rendered himself 
personally liable, in the manner herein provided 
for the execution of decrees and such person 
shall, for the purposes of appeal, be deemed to be 
a party within the meaning of section 47 
Provided that such notice as the Court in each 
case thinks sufficient has been given to the 
surety. 
 
9. 
Bare reading of said provision of law reflects that when a 
person becomes surety for performance of any decree or its part, or 
restitution of any property taken in execution of decree or payment of 
any money under an order of the Court in any suit or proceedings, the 
decree can be executed against him, to the extent for which surety has

rendered himself personally liable in the manners provided therein. 
After default has occurred there is no reason to absolve the 
Petitioner from his liability to pay the agreed amount which had 
become due against him in view of principles laid down in Section 
128 of the Contract Act, 1872 and Section 145, C.P.C. Reliance in 
said regard may be placed on “MUHAMMAD MUZAMAL RIAZ 
versus ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SHORKOT, District 
Jhang and 6 others” (2020 CLC 970).  
10. 
It is argued by learned counsel for the Petitioner that the 
Petitioner stood surety only for an amount of Rs.3,00,000/- which 
amount has already been paid by him during execution proceedings 
therefore, he is liable to be released and his property should also be 
detached.  
11. 
Record reveals that the judgment debtor (Respondent No.2) 
was sent to civil prison due to non-payment of decretal amount vide 
order dated 04.07.2022 and thereafter, the Petitioner/surety was 
summoned to satisfy the decree. It is also evident from the contents of 
surety bond that the Petitioner himself made him liable to pay the 
decretal amount in place of the judgment debtor on his failure to 
satisfy the decree. He thus now cannot wriggle out of his own 
undertaking. It is settled law that decree can also be executed against a 
surety. Reliance in this regard is placed on “Messrs STATE 
ENGINEERING 
CORPORATION 
LTD. 
versus 
NATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT 
FINANCE 
CORPORATION 
and 
others”  
(2006 SCMR 619) and “SHAFIULLAH versus SAIFULLAH and 7 
others” (PLD 2017 Peshawar 203). 
12. 
Even otherwise, there are concurrent findings of facts recorded 
by both the learned courts below which apparently do not suffer from 
any legal infirmity. Furthermore, when a factual controversy had 
been settled by the two courts below, unless and until there were 
compelling reasons shown for mis-reading and non-reading of 
evidence in the findings arrived at by courts below or there was a 
visible irregularity while deciding the dispute, this Court cannot 

W.P.Nos.2669 of 2023 
 
 6 
interfere with that findings. Evidence on record shows that findings 
recorded by the Family Court later concurred by the lower Appellate 
Court are in accordance with the evidence/law. Neither any 
jurisdictional error of the Courts below has been challenged, nor 
conduct of proceedings by the courts below has been called in 
question. 
No 
illegality 
having 
been 
found 
in 
the 
impugned concurrent judgments of the courts below, same could not 
be interfered with especially when these are based upon substantial 
evidence to which the Petitioner has not been able to controvert 
during the trial. Both the Courts have recorded findings of facts 
assigning cogent and sound reasoning which do not warrant any 
interference by this Court. Reliance is placed on “MST. TAYYEBA 
AMBAREEN and another versus SHAFQAT ALI KIYANI and 
another” (2023 SCMR 246) whereby the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
has held that “the appraisal of evidence is primarily the function of 
the Trial Court and, in this case, the Family Court which has been 
vested with exclusive jurisdiction. In constitutional jurisdiction when 
the findings are based on mis-reading or non-reading of evidence, 
and in case the order of the lower fora is found to be arbitrary, 
perverse, or in violation of law or evidence, the High Court can 
exercise its jurisdiction as a corrective measure. If the error is so 
glaring and patent that it may not be acceptable, then in such an 
eventuality the High Court can interfere when the finding is based on 
insufficient evidence, mis-reading of evidence, non-consideration of 
material evidence, erroneous assumption of fact, patent errors of law, 
consideration of inadmissible evidence, excess or abuse of 
jurisdiction, 
arbitrary 
exercise 
of 
power 
and  
where an unreasonable view on evidence has been taken.”. In  
“M. HAMAD HASSAN Versus Mst. ISMA BUKHARI and 2 others” 
(2023 SCMR 1434), the Supreme Court of Pakistan further held 
that “once a matter has been adjudicated upon on fact by the trial 
and the appellate courts, constitutional courts should not exceed 
their powers by reevaluating the facts or substituting the appellate 

W.P.Nos.2669 of 2023 
 
 7 
court's opinion with their own - the acceptance of finality of the 
appellate court’s findings is essential for achieving closure in legal 
proceedings 
conclusively 
resolving 
disputes, 
preventing 
unnecessary litigation, and upholding the legislature's intent to 
provide 
a 
definitive 
resolution 
through 
existing 
appeal 
mechanisms”. Reliance is also placed on “MST. NUSRAT and 
others versus DR. CAP. SHAHZAD RIAZ and others” (2011 SCMR 
1325) and “WAQAR HAIDER BUTT Versus JUDGE, FAMILY 
COURT and others” (2009 SCMR 1243). This Court is also not 
ordinarily inclined to interfere with the findings of fact recorded by 
the learned Courts below, particularly when they are not shown to be 
contrary to record or arbitrary or whimsical. In the instant case, apart 
from the bald assertions, no specific instance was brought to the 
notice of the Court that might be regarded as a case of misreading or 
non-reading of material evidence, having direct and decisive bearing 
on the issues. Both the Courts exercised the jurisdiction vested in 
them, without violating any principles governing the assessment and 
appraisal of evidence.  
13. 
In view of above, this petition holds no merit hence the same is 
hereby dismissed. However, the Executing Court is directed to decide 
the objection petition of surety, if any, pending, after framing of 
issues, recording of evidence of parties regarding the amount paid or 
to be paid by the Petitioner to the Respondent No.1 and affording 
opportunity of hearing to the parties in the light of judgment in the 
case of “AHMAD ALI and another versus Sheikh AMMAN ELAHI” 
(2015 CLC 1704).
