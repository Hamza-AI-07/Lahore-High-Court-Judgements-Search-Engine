JUDGMENT 
 
DATE OF HEARING:

PETITIONER BY: 
 
Ch. Awais Arif, Advocate. 
STATE BY: 
 
Miss Maida Sobia, Deputy Prosecutor 
General and Rana Muhammad Shafique, 
Deputy District Public Prosecutor. 
 
RESPONDENT BY: 
Mr. Jahanzeb Khan, Advocate.  
 
  
MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J:- Through this Criminal 
Revision under Sections 435 & 439 of Cr.P.C., petitioner Muhammad 
Asif, being accused of case FIR bearing No.166 dated 24.02.2020 
registered under section 302 PPC at Police Station Badami Bagh, 
Lahore has challenged the vires of order dated 01.02.2022 passed by 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore whereby Muhammad 
Awais, co-accused was tendered pardon under section 338 of Cr.P.C. 
to become approver against his co-accused Muhammad Asif (present 
petitioner).  
 
2. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that only 
Officer Incharge of prosecution in the district is authorized to tender 
pardon to the accused whereas in the present case he has not been 
taken on board. Further states that Muhammad Awais, co-accused has 
also not volunteered to become approver nor he accepted pardon 
offered to him by the leaned Additional Sessions Judge, therefore, 
until and unless the said process is completed under the law, such 
order could not have been passed. His arguments on another legal 
plane were that even Muhammad Awais, co-accused was not under 

Crl. Rev. No.12454 of 2022                    2 
the allegation of murder or abetment in initial investigation who was 
primarily a witness whose statement was recorded under section 161 
of Cr.P.C. However, he was later indicted during second investigation 
when found involved in the occurrence as abettor, therefore, his 
transposition as an accused is a question still lurking in the process.  
 
3.  
On the other hand, learned Prosecutors opposed the above 
contention with the ground that section 338 Cr.P.C. authorizes even to 
the Court to tender pardon to the accused at any stage of the 
proceedings before pronouncement of judgment, yet conceded that 
prosecution must have been taken into process; in support of 
contention reliance was placed on case reported as “Mst. RABIA BIBI 
versus ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE and 3 others” (PLD 2020 
Lahore 690).    
4. 
 
Contentions heard. Record perused.  
 
5. 
 
Record of learned trial Court was requisitioned, 
examination whereof reflects that complainant has filed an application 
on 09.07.2021 under section 337/338 of Cr.P.C. for tendering pardon 
to Muhammad Awais, co-accused for recording his evidence as an 
approver, which application remained pending without obtaining any 
consent of Awais to become approver and one day learned judge 
declared him as an approver through impugned order dated 
01.02.2022 without recording any cogent reason or observing the 
legal formalities. For clarity of concept, sections 337/338 of Cr.P.C. 
are reproduced as under: - 
337.   Tender of pardon to accomplice. (1) “In the case of any offence 
triable exclusively by the High Court or Court of Sessions, or any offence 
punishable with the imprisonment which may extend to ten years, or any 
offence punishable under Section 211 of the Pakistan Penal Code with 
imprisonment which may extend to seven years, or any offence under any 
of the following sections of the Pakistan Penal Code, namely, Sections 
216-A, 369, 401, 435 and 477-A, [officer-incharge of the prosecution in 
the District] may, at any stage of the investigation or inquiry into, or the 
trial of the offence, with a view to obtaining the evidence of any person 
supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to the 
offence, tender a pardon to such person on condition of his making a full 
and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within his 
knowledge relative to the offence and to every other person concerned, 
whether, as principal or abettor, in the commission thereof: 
 

Crl. Rev. No.12454 of 2022                    3 
[Provided that no person shall be tendered pardon who is involved in an 
offence relating to hurt or qatl without permission of the victim or, as the 
case may be, of the heirs of the victim.] 
(1-A) Every Magistrate who tenders a pardon under sub-section (1) shall 
record his reasons for so doing, and shall, on application made by the 
accused, furnish him with a copy of such record: 
Provided that the accused shall pay for the same unless the Magistrate for 
some special reason thinks fit to furnish it free of cost. 
[(2)   Every person accepting a tender under this section shall be 
examined as a witness in the subsequent trial, if any.] 
(2-A) In every case where a person has accepted a tender of pardon and 
has been examined under sub-section (2), the Magistrate before whom the 
proceedings are pending shall, if he is satisfied that there are reasonable 
grounds for believing that the accused is guilty of an offence, commit him 
for trial to the Court of Sessions or High Court, as the case may be. 
(3)     Such person, unless he is already on bail, shall be detained in 
custody until the termination of the trial. 
 
338. Power to grant or tender of pardon: At any time before the 
judgment is passed, the High Court or the Court of Session trying the case 
may, with the view of obtaining on the trial the evidence of any person 
supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in, or privy to, any 
such offence, tender, or order the [officer incharge of the prosecution in 
the District] to tender, a pardon on the same condition to such person.]  
 
[Provided that no person shall be tendered pardon who is involved in an 
offence relating to hurt or qatl without permission of the victim or, as the 
base may be, of the heirs of the victim.]” 
 
The above sections deal separately with the situations of tendering 
pardon by the Officer Incharge of the prosecution as well as the Court. 
Section 337 of Cr.P.C. deals with the situation when the case is in the 
investigation or inquiry or pending trial before a Magistrate, whereas 
section 338 of Cr.P.C. meets the situation when the trial is pending 
before the Court of Session or High Court. Section 337 Cr.P.C. talks 
about the condition and recording of reasons for tendering pardon to 
the accused. Sub-section (1) of section 337 Cr.P.C. enumerates the 
condition as follows; 
“………on condition of his making a full and true disclosure of 
the whole of the circumstances within his knowledge relative to 
the offence and to every other person concerned, whether, as 
principal or abettor, in the commission thereof;” 
 
And subsection (1-A) of such section makes it mandatory by using 
the word “shall” for the Magistrate to record his reasons for so 
doing, and shall, on application made by the accused, furnish him 
with a copy of such record.  

Crl. Rev. No.12454 of 2022                    4 
 
6.    Primarily, an offer to tender pardon to the accused during the 
investigation is the function of police as mentioned in Rule 25.29 of 
the Police Rules, 1934 but they could not offer it except as 
mentioned in sub-rule (2) of above Rule, which is as follows; 
 
(a) No police officer may offer a pardon. An accused person 
desirous of making a statement with a view to obtaining a pardon, 
shall be told that no promise whatsoever can be made, but that, if a 
statement is made and verified and found to be of sufficient 
importance to merit such action, the facts will be reported to a 
magistrate, who has power to offer a pardon. No steps may be taken 
in this connection by subordinate police officers without the previous 
sanction in writing of a gazetted police officer. 
 
It was the practice that once it is decided to offer a pardon to the 
accused, he must had been taken to the Magistrate in order to tender 
the same and Magistrate under sub-rule 2(c) of above Rule could 
make enquiries as to the circumstances leading up to the confession, 
and police officers shall invariably furnish, so far as is in their 
power, information required of them in this respect. Later by virtue 
of amendment in section 337 Cr.P.C. through Ordinance XXXVII of 
2001, the power was switched over to officer incharge of the 
prosecution in the district. Thus, on the same analogy, as per section 
337 of Cr.P.C. he is required to observe the condition and record the 
reasons for so doing. After promulgation of Punjab Criminal 
Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions and Powers) Act, 2006, 
a Code of conduct for prosecutors was issued under section 17 of the 
Act ibid; Para No. 14 of said Code of conduct refers the functions of 
District Public Prosecutor in this respect as follows; 
 
                   Tender of Pardon 
 
14.1 
A pardon should only be considered by a Prosecutor where 
the offence is of a serious nature, there are overwhelming 
reasons for the prosecution to go ahead and there is a great 
need for and high value attached to the approver’s evidence 
 
14.2 
A prosecutor may initiate the process of grant of tender of 
pardon on his own or on the request of the concerned police 
officer or on the order of the court.  
 
14.3 
An offer of pardon must contain the specific actions 
required on the part of the accomplice to whom the offer is 
being made. 
 

Crl. Rev. No.12454 of 2022                    5 
14.4 
A tender of pardon must be in writing and signed by the 
District Public Prosecutor. 
 
During the course of investigation if the accused accepts the offer, 
his status from an accused is transposed to that of a witness and he 
shall be brought before the Magistrate for recording of his statement 
(not the confession) on oath u/s 164 of Cr.P.C., and copy of such 
statement shall be supplied to co-accused under section 241-A or 
265-C Cr.P.C. as the case may be before the commencement of trial. 
If such a power is exercised at the stage when trial is pending, then 
after fulfilling the condition and recording of reasons, if the accused 
accepts the offer, Magistrate shall examine him as a witness during 
the trial but before that he shall be taken into custody till the 
conclusion of trial as required by sub-section (3) of Section 337 
Cr.P.C.; sub-rule 2 (f) of Rule 25.29 of Police Rules, 1934 and Rule-
8 of Chapter 14 of High Court Rules & Orders, Volume-III.  
  
7.     The proposition in this case relates to a stage as enumerated in 
section 338 of Cr.P.C., therefore, not only the officer incharge of the 
prosecution but the Court can tender pardon to the accused at any 
stage of the trial before the judgment is passed with a view to 
obtaining evidence and in this case it has been done by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge but before that it was essential that 
accused should have volunteered to become approver in response to 
a request made by the complainant or the Court. Though application 
of the complainant states that Muhammad Awais, co-accused is 
ready to become approver but his consent in black and white is not 
available in the record. Similar is the situation when Court has also 
not taken his consent before tendering him pardon. In this view of 
the matter, order dated 01.02.2022 passed by learned Additional 
Sessions Judge one-sidedly considering that Awais would be a 
useful witness as an approver is opposed to Constitutional protection 
as ordained under Article 13 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
republic of Pakistan, 1973 which says that: 
No person—  
“(a) ……………………………………………………...................; or 

Crl. Rev. No.12454 of 2022                    6 
 
(b) shall, when accused of an offence, be compelled to be a witness 
against himself.” 
 
Likewise, section 338 of Cr.P.C requires that no person shall be 
tendered pardon who is involved in an offence relating to hurt or qatl 
without permission of the victim or, as the case may be, of the heirs of 
the victim. The present case is of qatl but Court has not obtained 
consent of legal heirs of the deceased before tendering pardon to the 
accused Awais; therefore, order is also liable to be set aside on this 
legal premise as well.  
 
8.     It is also the requirement of law that when an accused is tendered 
pardon, he must be kept in custody until the trial is concluded and 
Officer Incharge of prosecution certifies that accused has made full 
and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances so as to prevent 
his trial as an accused under section 339/339A of Cr.P.C., but in this 
case Awais accused was not taken into custody which action is in 
violation of sub-section (3) of Section 337 Cr.P.C.; sub-rule 2 (f) of 
Rule 25.29 of Police Rules, 1934 and Rule-8 of Chapter 14 of High 
Court Rules & Orders, Volume-III; therefore, order impugned is 
bereft of legal sanctity. Reliance is also placed on case reported as 
“QAMAR-UZ-ZAMAN AND ANOTHER versus THE STATE” (1981 
PLD Lahore 543) 
 
9.    The most important of all considerations is the logic applied by 
the Court to use an accused as approver, at the altar of absolving him 
of his criminal liability against the sentiments of aggrieved party, for 
procuring conviction in order to dispense justice. Thus, reasons must 
be outlined by the Court before frame of mind to tender pardon to an 
accused as held in cases reported as “MUHMAMMAD SALEEM versus 
THE STATE” (1989 P Cr. L J 1262). Act of Court by granting a 
pardon orally was declared unwarranted in a case reported as 
“QAMAR-UZ-ZAMAN AND ANOTHER versus THE STATE” (1981 PLD 
Lahore 543). Supreme Court of India has also held in a Case reported 
as “Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar Versus State of 

Crl. Rev. No.12454 of 2022                    7 
Maharashtra” (2009 (2) SCC (Cri) 1150) that it is essential to record 
reasons and to further whether pardon was or was not accepted by the 
person to whom it was made. Similar is the requirement of Rule-3, 
Chapter-14 of High Court Rules and Orders, Volume-III which is 
reproduced for reference; 
 
3. Reasons for tendering pardon should be recorded and extent of 
pardon explained to the intended approver.--***[…] In all cases in 
which a pardon is tendered. [the reasons for tendering the pardon must 
be recorded and] the intended approver should always be made 
carefully to understand the extent of the pardon offered to him: it 
should be explained to him that he is being tendered a pardon and not 
be prosecuted in respect of such and such a case and no others. 
 
10.    In this case Court has not taken the prosecution on board before 
tendering the pardon to the accused which is an illegality because 
though Court has power to tender pardon to any person but the Court 
can have no interest whatsoever in the outcome nor to decide for 
prosecution whether particular evidence is required or not to ensure 
the conviction of the accused. That is the prosecution’s job. It has 
been held in a case reported as “Lt. Commander Pascal Fernandes 
Versus State of Maharashtra” (AIR 1968 Supreme Court 594) as 
under; 
“……… Ordinarily it is for the prosecution to ask that a particular 
accused, out of several, may be tendered pardon. But even where 
the accused directly applies to the Special Judge he must first refer 
the request to the prosecuting agency. It is not for the Special judge 
to enter the ring as a veritable director of prosecution. The power 
which the Special Judge exercises is not on his own behalf but on 
behalf of prosecuting agency, and must, therefore, be exercised only 
when the prosecution joins in the request. The State may not desire 
that any accused be tendered pardon because it does not need 
approver’s testimony. It may also not like the tender of pardon to 
particular accused because he may be the brain behind the crime or 
the worst offender. The proper course for the Special Judge is to ask 
for a statement from the prosecution on the request of prisoner. If 
the prosecution thinks that that tender of pardon will be in the 
interest of a successful prosecution of the other offenders whose 
conviction is not easy without the approver’s testimony, it will 
indubitably agree to the tendering of pardon.  The Special Judge (or 
the Magistrate) must not take on himself the task of determining the 
propriety of tendering pardon in the circumstances of the case.   
 
The above judgment has also been cited in a case reported as “Jasbir 
Singh Verus Vipin Kumar Jaggi” (2001 AIR (SC) 2734) and “Mst. 

Crl. Rev. No.12454 of 2022                    8 
RABIA BIBI versus ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE and 3 others” 
(PLD 2020 Lahore 690).     
11.    While acting with due propriety in jurisdiction Court must bear 
in the mind that interests of accused are just as important as those of 
the prosecution. No procedure or action can be in the interest of 
justice if it is prejudicial to an accused. There are also matters of 
public policy to consider. Judge must know the nature of the 
evidence the person seeking conditional pardon is likely to give, the 
nature of his complicity and degree of his culpability in relation to 
the offence and in relation to co-accused. Case reported as “Jasbir 
Singh Verus Vipin Kumar Jaggi” (2001 AIR (SC) 2734) is referred 
in this respect. Even it is possible that in a case more than one 
person turns approver or the prosecution wants to use them, then 
according to sub-rule 2 (g) of Rule 25.29 of Police Rules, 1934, their 
confessions shall, if possible, be recorded by different magistrates 
and they shall not be allowed to meet one another till their evidence 
has been recorded in Court.  
 
12. 
          In view of above for what has been discussed, order 
dated 01.02.2022 (impugned herein), passed by learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Lahore is set aside. Record of learned trial Court 
may be returned immediately. Appreciation to Mr. Muhammad Afzil, Civil 
Judge/research officer who worked well to collect required case law on the 
directed lines.
