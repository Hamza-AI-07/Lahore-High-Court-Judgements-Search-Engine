This Civil Revision is directed against the 
judgments/orders of Courts below whereby the objections 
raised by the petitioners upon the maintainability of the 
execution petition were dismissed concurrently.  
2. 
Tersely, facts forming background of proceedings in 
hand are that respondent No.1 namely Siraj Ahmad 
(plaintiff) instituted a suit for possession through pre-
emption against the petitioners No.1 & 2 namely Mehmood 
and Seedu (defendants No.1 & 2). After full-fledged trial, 
said suit was decreed by the learned Trial Court vide 
judgment & decree dated 29.03.1978. Feeling aggrieved, 
petitioners No.1 & 2 preferred an appeal which was allowed 
by the leaned Appellate Court vide judgment & decree 
dated 18.09.1978 and as a consequence thereof plaint was 
rejected under Order VII Rule 11 (Clauses B & C) of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Being dissatisfied, 
respondent No.1 filed Regular Second Appeal (R.S.A. 
No.806 of 1978) before this Court. During the pendency of 
said appeal, parties arrived at a compromise as a result 
thereof said appeal was disposed of in terms of compromise 
which was made part of the decree as Mark-A. For the 
satisfaction of said decree, legal heirs of respondent No.1 

C.R. No.1463 of 2023.  
2
filed an execution petition on 20.05.2023. Petitioners raised 
the objections with regard to the maintainability of the 
execution petition by stating that it was settled between the 
parties that respondent No.1 would withdraw his appeal, 
therefore, the Hon’ble High Court did not pass any decree 
and also maintained that the respondent No.1 filed 
execution petition in the year 2023 for the execution of 
decree passed in the year 2003 which is barred by time. The 
learned Executing Court rejected the objections and 
directed the Revenue Authorities to implement the 
compromise Mark-A in the revenue record and transferred 
the suit property in the name of legal heirs of Siraj Ahmad 
(respondent No.1) and petitioners were also directed to 
hand over the amount Rs.16,000/- to the respondents after 
withdrawal from the Court. Feeling aggrieved, petitioners 
preferred an appeal which was dismissed-in-limine vide 
judgment & memo of cost dated 03.10.2023. Hence, this 
petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
petitioners maintains that impugned judgments/orders of 
Courts below are against the facts & law, illegal, void and 
having no effect; that the execution petition filed by the 
respondents was badly barred by time which was filed after 
lapse of 20 years but the Courts below failed to consider 
this aspect while passing the impugned order and prayed for 
acceptance of the Writ Petition.  
4. 
Preliminary arguments are heard. Record perused.  
5. 
It is matter of record that during the pendency of the 
Regular Second Appeal before this Court predecessor of the 
respondents namely Siraj Ahmad moved an application 
(C.M. No.1098 of 2001) with the prayer that the above appeal 
may kindly be permitted to be withdrawn in terms of 
compromise by stating as under: 
“2. 
That out side of the court the parties has patch 
up the dispute and the matter has been compromised 
in between the parties through Punchayat.  

C.R. No.1463 of 2023.

3. 
That Agricultural land situated in Square 
No.15/2-14-23/2-22-20 comprising 31 Kanals 10 
Marlas actually belong to Mehmood Ali and 
Muhammad 
Siddique 
s/o 
Muhammad 
Suleman 
(respondents) shall hand over the possession of the 
said Agricultural Land to appellant.  
4. 
That in view of the Punchayat’s decision/ 
affidavit the respondents shall hand over the 
possession of the Agricultural land to the appellant 
situated in Square No.162. Further the respondents 
are responsible to appear before Registrar to get 
transfer the said land in the name of the appellant. 
Therefore the petitioner wants to withdraw the above 
appeal in terms of compromise.  
5. 
That the respondents shall withdraw the 
amount Rs.16,000/- deposited by the appellant lying in 
the Bank and thereafter withdrawal the said amount 
shall hand over to the appellant.   
 
It is, therefore, humbly prayed that the 
above appeal may kindly be withdrawn in 
terms of compromise. Prayer may kindly be 
allowed in the interest of justice.”  
 
6. 
In the light of said application, this Court vide order 
dated 10.03.2003 disposed of the appeal in the following 
terms:  
“Learned counsel for the parties submit that matter 
has been compromised in terms of C.M.No.1098/01 
mark’A’ and that this appeal be disposed of in terms of 
the compromise mark ‘A’. Order accordingly. Appeal 
is disposed of in the light of compromise application 
mark ‘A’. Terms and condition of the compromise 
application mark ‘A’ be made part of the decree-
sheet.” 
 
Decree was drawn accordingly on 29.03.2003.  
7. 
It is matter of record that earlier respondent No.1 
moved an application on 29.07.2003 before the concerned 
Tehsildar for implementation of the decree. Tehsildar called 
report from the concerned Patwari who on 08.08.2003 
reported as under:

Subsequently, respondent No.1 again moved an 
application on 14.02.2015 to the Assistant Commissioner, 
Shujaabad for implementation of the said decree, whereby 
vide order dated 09.06.2015 matter was referred to District 
Collector, who entrusted the same to Additional District 
Collector. The Additional District Collector, via order dated 
26.04.2017 rejected the application for implementation of 
the decree being barred by time. Feeling aggrieved, 
respondents preferred an appeal which was allowed by the 
Additional Commissioner (Consolidation), through order 
dated 27.01.2018 whereby he directed to implement the 
compromise decree in the revenue record. Being 
dissatisfied, petitioners filed a revision of revision (ROR 
No.324 of 2018) before the Member Board of Revenue, 
Punjab, which was allowed vide judgment dated 30.06.2022 
with a direction to the parties to go for implementation of 
the decree as per procedure laid down in Order XXI of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, while approaching proper 
forum. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
said 
direction, 
decree 
holders/respondents filed the execution petition on 
20.05.2023.  
9. 
A decree in a pre-emption suit is of a peculiar nature 
which is passed in accordance with the provisions contained 
in Order XX, Rule 14(1), C.P.C., which lays down that 
where the Court decrees a claim to pre-emption in respect 
of a particular sale of property and the purchase money has 
not been paid in the Court the decree shall (a) specify a date 
on or before which the purchase money shall be so paid; 
and (b) direct that on payment into Court of such purchase 
money together with the costs (if any), decree against the 
plaintiff, on or before the day referred to in clause (a), the 
defendant shall deliver the possession of the property to the 
plaintiff, whose title thereto shall be deemed to have 
accrued from the date of such payment, the said rule reads 
as under: - 
 

C.R. No.1463 of 2023.  
5
“Decree for pre-emption suit: (1) Where the 
Court decrees a claim to pre-emption in respect of a 
particular sale of property and the purchase-money 
has not been paid into Court, the decree shall---- 
(a) 
Specify a day on or before which the purchase-
money shall be so paid, and  
(b) 
Direct that on payment into Court of such 
purchase-money, together with the costs if any decreed 
against the plaintiff, on or before the day referred to in 
clause (a), the defendant shall deliver possession of 
the property to the plaintiff, whose title thereto shall be 
deemed to have accrued from the date of such 
payment, but that, if the purchase-money and the costs 
(if any) are not so paid, the suit shall be dismissed with 
costs. 
(2) Where the Court has adjudicated upon rival claims 
to pre-emption, the decree shall direct,- 
(a) If and in so far as the claims decreed are equal 
in degree, that the claim of each pre-emptor 
complying with the provisions of sub-rule(1) 
shall take effect in respect of a proportionate 
share 
of 
the 
property 
including 
any 
proportionate share in respect of which the 
claim of any pre-emptor failing to comply with 
the said provisions would, but for such default, 
have taken effect; and 
(b) If and in so far as the claims decreed are 
different in degree, that the claim of the 
inferior pre-emptor shall not take effect unless 
and until the superior pre-emptor has failed to 
comply with the said provisions.” 
 
 
The learned Division Bench of this Court in the case 
titled “ALI AHMAD AND ANOTHER V. MUHAMMAD 
FAZAL AND ANOTHER (PLD 1973 LAHORE 207), 
observed that where the trial Court passed a decree for 
possession on the basis of pre-emption in favour of the 
respondent/pre-emptor as a result of compromise which was 
arrived at between the parties and the respondent paid the 
entire amount in the Court, the decree conclusively 
determines the rights of the parties with regard to the 
matters in controversy in the suit. The suit for pre-emption 
has special incidents and the property vests in the vendee by 
virtue of the sale made in his favour by the vendor, 
therefore, when a person files a suit to pre-empt the sale, he 
does not do so in the exercise of any right in the property 
but on the basis of his statutory right to pre-empt the sale, 
he, therefore, does not have any existing right in the 
property when he institutes the suit but it is only when the 

C.R. No.1463 of 2023.  
6
decree is passed and the payment is made then the decree 
becomes final in his favour and he becomes vested with the 
property and held as under: - 
"4. The appellants, therefore, can succeed only if they 
are able to make out that section 28 of the Limitation 
Act is attracted. It reads as: "At the determination of 
the period hereby limited to any person for instituting a 
suit for possession of any property, his right to such 
property shall be extinguished." This section applies to 
suits, and suit as provided under section 2, clause (10) 
of the Limitation Act "does not include an appeal or an 
application". Article 182 does not prescribe the period 
of limitation for the institution of a suit by the decree-
holder. It merely prescribed the period of limitation for 
an application for delivery of possession to him. Section 
28 does not apply to applications for execution under 
Article 182. Therefore, if the respondent did not apply 
for the execution within the period of limitation, his 
right and title in the property which he acquired by 
virtue of the decree for pre-emption is not extinguished. 
He continues to be the owner of the land 
notwithstanding that he did not file an application for 
execution." 
 
 
 
 
The losing party of said case was went to the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan wherein it was held that when a 
valid decree in a pre-emption suit was passed in favour of 
a party he became owner of the property on payment of 
purchase price, and thus, became vested with the right, 
interest and title in the land from that date. He was, 
therefore, entitled to get mutation effected on the basis of 
the decree. Mere fact that the decree was barred by time, 
therefore, it has lost its utility was not correct as the 
revenue authorities were under obligation to enter mutation 
on the basis of such decree. For reference reliance is 
placed on the case titled “ALI AHMAD AND ANOTHER V. 
MUHAMMAD FAZAL AND ANOTHER (1972 SCMR 
322).  
 
The execution of the decree and the withdrawal of the 
money or its payment to the vendee is not relevant or of 
consequence for the vesting of the title in the pre-emptor as 
held by august supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment 
titled  “DR. NIAZ MUHAMMAD MANN AND OTHERS V. 

C.R. No.1463 of 2023.  
7
SH. MUHAMMAD AHMAD AND ANOTHER (1988 SCMR 
1016)”.  
 
 
 
With reference to the provisions of Order XX, Rule 
14 C.P.C., the scope of decree framed in a pre-emption suit 
was discussed and it was held that such decree being of a 
particular nature, title of property would accrue to decree-
holder on payment in Court of purchase money together 
with costs, if any. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in a case reported as “MAULVI ABDUL QAYYUM V. 
SYED ALI ASGHAR SHAH AND 5 OTHERS (1992 SCMR 
241)”, guided as under:  
 
“10. It will be material to bear in mind, that a decree in 
a pre-emption suit is of a peculiar nature. Under Order 
20, Rule 14, C.P.C., the title of the property accrues to 
the decree-holder on payment in the Court of purchase 
money together with costs, if any. It has not been 
controverted before us that the requirements of Rule 14 
have already been complied with by the appellant. 
Thus, irrespective of the fact whether the possession is 
delivered to him or not, title in the property has vested 
in the appellant and he is owner of the land in dispute. 
Viewed in this context, the respondents' opposition to 
the execution of the decree becomes all the more 
ethereal.” 
 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case 
titled “SHAHRA V. MEMBER, BOARD OF REVENUE 
(2004 SCMR 117)” with regard to sanction of mutation on 
the basis of decree for pre-emption passed by the Civil 
Court, it was held that on deposit of pre-emption money as 
ordered in pre-emption decree, the pre-emptor/decree-
holder was vested with full ownership rights of land the 
subject matter of the suit of pre-emption about which decree 
was passed. In such circumstances, sanction of mutation 
could be made on the basis of decree under revenue law, 
without resorting to Executing Court. The Executing Court 
in such matters would be involved in case the judgment-
debtor failed to deliver possession of the land which was 
required to be delivered by Executing Court by issuance of 
warrant of possession. Law did not require that before 
sanction of mutation on the basis of pre-emption decree, the 

C.R. No.1463 of 2023.  
8
Revenue Authorities should have required the pre-emptors 
to obtain order from Executing Court. 
 
 
 
In the case of “MST. HAKAM BIBI V. KHUSHI 
MUHAMMAD (2007 SCMR 983)” the provisions of 
section 48, Order XX Rule 14 and Order XXI Rule 36 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, were discussed with 
reference to execution of a pre-emption decree, and it 
was held that the judgment in favour of the pre-emptor 
was conditional, subject to payment of balance amount 
and after deposit of said amount he was entitled to get 
relief in terms of Order XX, Rule 14, C.P.C., wherein 
after satisfying the decree regarding payment, decree-
holder was not required to file execution petition.  
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case 
reported as “MST. NIAZ BIBI THROUGH L.RS. V. 
GHULAM MUSTAFA AND OTHERS  (PLD 2011 
SUPREME COURT 520)”, observed as under:  
“A plain reading of rule 14 of Order XX, C.P.C. reveals 
that for preparation and implementation of decree 
passed in a pre-emption suit, a particular procedure 
has been laid down, which provides that manner for 
payment of purchase money, in case it has not been 
paid in the court earlier, with delivery of possession of 
the property to the pre-emptor and the mode and 
manner through which the title of the pre-empted 
property shall be automatically acquired by the pre-
emptor from the date of payment of pre-emption money.  
 
The scope and import of Order XX, Rule 14, C.P.C. is 
that irrespective of the fact that actual physical 
possession was received by the pre-emptor in terms of 
the compromise decree or not, upon payment/deposit of 
pre-emption money in court in terms of the decree, pre-
emptors acquired absolute title of suit-land in his/her 
favour.”  
 
10. 
The right of pre-emption means one of substitution 
and the decree holder steps into the shoes of judgment 
debtor with regard to the sale. In this context the respondent 
No.1/(decree holder) firstly moved an application before 
Tehsildar on 29.07.2003 which remained undecided, then 
he again moved an application to the Assistant 
Commissioner for implementation of the decree passed in 
his favour but the Additional District Collector vide order 

C.R. No.1463 of 2023.  
9
dated 
26.04.2017 
rejected 
his 
application 
for 
implementation of the decree being barred by time. 
Thereafter, 
respondent 
No.1 
approached 
Additional 
Commissioner (Consolidation) by preferring an appeal 
which was allowed vide order dated 27.01.2018 while 
directing the Revenue Officer to implement the compromise 
decree in the revenue record. The petitioners challenged 
said order before the Member Board of Revenue, Punjab, 
who by setting-aside the order under challenge made a 
direction to the parties to go for implementation of the 
decree as per procedure laid down in order XXI of the Code 
of Civil Procedure, 1908. 
11. 
The Revenue Authorities are under obligation to 
sanction mutation on the basis of the decree of a Civil Court 
and cannot refuse attestation of mutation on the ground that 
the decree was not put into execution within the prescribed 
period of limitation and had become ineffective. The view 
taken by the Member Board of Revenue is in conflict with 
the dictum led down by the august Supreme Court. He was 
on legal misconception in assuming that the implementation 
of the decree of a Civil Court could be declined by a 
revenue officer on the plea of having not been put into 
execution for a period of three years or that its execution 
had become barred by time. The said Member did not 
consider that the decree which was being implemented was 
a decree in a pre-emption matter which has its own 
significant features. The decree holder in a suit for pre-
emption on deposit of decretal amount, in term of order XX 
Rule 14, C.P.C., became absolute owner of the suit 
property, and such ownership would remain operative and 
intact even if such decree was not put to execution. 
Revenue Officer was under statutory duty to implement 
such decree in revenue record even if execution petition had 
become time barred. The pre-emptor/decree holder becomes 
absolute owner of the suit property and sanction of mutation 
could be made on the basis of said decree without resorting 

C.R. No.1463 of 2023.  
10
to execution proceedings. The executing Court in such 
matters would only be involved in case where the judgment 
debtor fails to deliver the possession of the land in 
pursuance of such decree and in such case the executing 
court will be required to deliver the same by issuance of 
warrant of possession.  
12. 
Rights in suit property accrued to the respondent-
decree holder after payment of consideration amount, 
therefore, it is not fair to deprive him from the benefit of the 
decree as laid down by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in case “SYED PHUL SHAH V. MUHAMMAD 
HUSSAIN AND 10 OTHERS (PLD 1991 SC 1051)” the 
relevant observations are as follow:- 
 
“It is also a well-known principle in Islamic justice, that 
one who succeeds in a litigation unjustly must not retain 
the benefit. It has been equated with burning charcoal 
in one’s pocket; which, burns and eats away the 
winner’s belongings including the retaining pocket also. 
Thus, while trying our best to do justice in accordance 
with law, the principles in our own jurisprudence 
governing just dispensation shall have to be kept in 
view. In other words, while adhering to the principle; 
justice in accordance with law, we will have to keep in 
mind that it is the birth right of every citizen in an 
Islamic State to seek and obtain justice. In this exercise 
of keeping balance between the undiluted justice and 
justice only in accordance with law, the general 
directional principles in Islamic come to the aid when, 
one exerts.” 
 
 
It is also well settled that justice should not be 
sacrificed on account of technicalities which did not go to 
the root of the cause; in so far as the fairness thereof is 
concerned. It was further held in the said case as under: - 
“Even if there would have been some force in the 
technical objection of the learned counsel, justice could 
not have been sacrificed, at least in this court, on the 
altar of the technicality which does not go to the root of 
the cause, in so for as the fairness thereof is concerned. 
The courts in Pakistan combine law and justice under 
the umbrella of Islamic jurisprudence; which provides 
harmonious solutions for situations like the present one. 
One amongst other principles which operates is that an 
obviously unjust and wrong decision which is also 
against the substantive law of the country shall be 
avoided by the Court.” 
 

C.R. No.1463 of 2023.  
11
13. 
In view of the above discussion, the respondent 
No.1/decree holder of the pre-emption decree acquired 
absolute title over the suit property when he deposited the 
pre-emption money. The Revenue Authorities were duty 
bound to implement the pre-emption decree in the revenue 
record but they failed to discharge their function in 
accordance with law and denied to fulfil their legal and 
statutory duty despite respondent No.1 approached them, 
which constrained him to resort to the executing Court for 
redressal of his grievance. The learned Executing Court 
keeping in view the spirit of the pre-emption decree 
directed the Revenue Authorities to implement “Mark-A” in 
the revenue record. Therefore, the question of limitation 
does not arise with regard to the said execution petition. 
The learned Courts below have rightly rejected objection of 
the petitioners with regard to limitation. Learned counsel 
appearing on behalf of the petitioners remained unable to 
highlight any illegality, irregularity, mis-reading/non-
reading 
or 
jurisdictional 
defect 
in 
the 
impugned 
judgments/orders of lower fora which do not call for any 
interference by this Court while exercising revisional 
jurisdiction.   
14. 
As an inevitable corollary of above discussion, this 
revision petition, having no force/substance is dismissed-in-
limine with no order as to costs.
