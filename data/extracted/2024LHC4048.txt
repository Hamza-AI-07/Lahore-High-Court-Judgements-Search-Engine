Date of Hearing: 
09.09.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. 
Tariq 
Mehmood 
Dogar, 
Advocate. 
Respondents by: 
Mr. Khalid Masood Ghani, Assistant 
Advocate General.  
   
 
 
      Anwaar Hussain, J.   The post of Patwari was advertised by 
the Office of the Assistant Commissioner, Saddar, Multan, through 
advertisement, available as Annex-A of the case file, inviting applications 
from the residents of District Multan, and the petitioner along with others 
participated in the said process.  
2. 
It is the case of the petitioner that he has been non-suited on the 
ground that the post in question is Tehsil specific and since the petitioner 
is resident of Tehsil City, Multan and the post pertains to Tehsil Saddar, 
Multan, he is not entitled to the appointment. Learned counsel for the 
petitioner submits that it is fourth round of litigation. Adds that in the first 
round of litigation constitutional petition bearing W.P No.4816/2022 was 
filed laying challenge to the irregularities in the recruitment process of 
Patwaris wherein direction was given to Deputy Commissioner, Multan 
to probe the matter. In second round of litigation W.P. No.8238/2022 was 
filed and the order dated 21.04.2022, impugned therein was set at naught 
by this Court, vide order dated 07.12.2022, and the respondents were 
directed to decide the matter afresh whereafter order dated 05.06.2023 

W.P. No.10689 of 2024 
                                                            
 
           - 2 - 
 
was passed against the petitioner, which was challenged through W.P. 
No.11477 of 2023 that was allowed by this Court, vide order dated 
18.04.2024, while holding that if the posts advertised were Tehsil specific, 
the matter should have been re-advertised by stipulating so, since an 
advertisement for recruitments amounts to promise stating all the rules, 
which the Authority undertakes to observe but the same has not been 
adhered to by the respondents. In support of his contentions, places 
reliance upon cases reported as “Usmat Batool v. Bahauddin Zakariya 
University, Multan through Registrar and 5 others”1 and “Rasheed-ud-
Din and another v. Provincial Government through Chief Secretary, 
Gilgit Baltistan, Gilgit and others”2. Adds that while passing the 
impugned order, this aspect has not been addressed.  
3. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer submits that the impugned order 
has been passed after thorough examination of the record and nowhere in 
the earlier order dated 18.04.2024, this Court while allowing W.P. 
No.11477/2023 has held that the appointment letter is to be issued to the 
petitioner. Further contends that the rules have to take preference over the 
inadvertent errors in the advertisement.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
The pivotal question of law emanating from the facts spelled out 
hereinabove is the interplay between the appointment rules of a post and 
the advertisement for the said post as well as the impact of an apparent 
inconsistency between the two. In the present case, admittedly the post of 
Patwari is Tehsil specific in terms of the applicable Rules3 and the merit 
list was accordingly compiled albeit pursuant to an advertisement, which 
does not depict the fact that the post is Tehsil specific. Schedule to the 
Rules contemplates as under:

In the same vein, it is also admitted feature of the case that the only 
requirement stipulated in the advertisement was that a candidate must be 
resident of District Multan. Thus, there is apparent disconnect between the 
applicable rules and the advertisement pertaining to the post of the 
Patwari. While the Rules require the appointment of a candidate who 
belongs to the Tehsil where appointment is to be made, the advertisement 
only required the candidate to be resident of the District Multan. It is also 
borne from the record that there are still three vacant posts available in the 
Tehsil Sadar but the petitioner has been denied appointment on account of 
not being resident of the Tehsil Sadar to which the said post belongs. This 
Court is of the view that the Rules stipulating the candidate to be resident 
of the Tehsil to which the post belongs is to be accorded the precedence 
over the requirement stipulated in the advertisement as the Rules are 
conferred with the statutory force, which cannot be trumped and nullified 
by intentional and/or unintentional mistake on part of the department 
while advertising the posts of Patwari. The Rules provide for the criterion 
and the mechanism for the appointment and filling up the post whereas the 
advertisement is one of the steps and/or subsets of the overall scheme of 

W.P. No.10689 of 2024 
                                                            
 
           - 4 - 
 
appointment envisaged under the law. Therefore, it belies logic if a subset 
of the process is permitted to attain primacy over the entire scheme 
envisaged under the Rules itself. 
6. 
The plea of the petitioner that a candidate at Sr. No.103 of the 
waiting list has been appointed whereas the petitioner is at Sr. No.93 is 
also of no help to the petitioner inasmuch as the petitioner has not been 
able to demonstrate that either the said candidate at Sr. No.103 of the 
merit list or any other candidate has been appointed who belongs to the 
Tehsil other than Tehsil Sadar. Even otherwise, any such possibility might 
also not have been of any help to the petitioner as the ground of 
discrimination is available and can be invoked only if favourable 
treatment to some other similarly placed person is meted out in 
accordance with law and the person claiming discrimination is denied 
such treatment. If some other person has been favoured in unlawful 
manner and against the law, the same cannot be made basis to confer such 
treatment to others as the same is against the law as held by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case titled “Muhammad Yasin vs. The Director 
General, Pakistan Post Office, Islamabad and another”4. 
7. 
As far as the plea that the respondents by providing the requirement 
of residence in the District Multan are now estopped by claiming 
otherwise and denying the appointment to the petitioner, the same lacks 
persuasion as it is settled law that there is no estoppel against the law. 
Thus, department is justified in exhibiting strict adherence to the Rules 
providing for the appointment criterion. The rules are to be strictly 
adhered to and even if there was an omission in the advertisement, the 
department has not violated the legal provision thereof to operate as an 
estoppel on the respondents. 
8. 
The judgments cited at the bar by learned counsel for the petitioner 
are distinguishable from the facts of the instant case. In case of Rasheed-
ud-Din supra, the recruitment criterion provided under the rules pertaining

W.P. No.10689 of 2024

to the appointment thereof had been changed subsequent to the written 
examination. In the said case, at the time of advertisement and written 
examination, 20 marks were allocated for past experience in the field of 
disaster management whereas 10 marks were allocated for interview and 
the rules were amended subsequent to the advertisement as well as written 
examination, and 20 marks of past experience were deleted and merged 
into interview making the marks of interview as 30. Thus, case of 
Rasheed-ud-Din supra, is of no help to the case of the petitioner, rather 
the same is inimical to the case of the petitioner as the Court in the said 
case preferred and accorded primacy to the rules providing for the 
appointment criterion. Similarly, in case of Usmat Batool supra, in the 
advertisement thereof, it was specifically laid down that no experience 
was required but while adopting the short listing criteria, 4 marks per year 
for the work experience, upto maximum of 20 marks, were awarded and 
therefore, the said petition was allowed, however, in the said case, the 
question whether short listing criteria was envisaged under the rules was 
not under discussion, hence, no violation of the rules was under 
consideration in case of Usmat Batool supra. In the instant case, if the 
plea of the petitioner is accepted, this would amount to change in the 
Rules and/or the violation thereof, which is not permissible. This is clearly 
the domain of the executive as this Court cannot substitute the Rules, 
which have been framed under and in exercise of the legislative domain 
and power of the State.  
9. 
In view of the above discussion, the present petition is devoid of 
any merit and hence, dismissed. No order as to costs.
