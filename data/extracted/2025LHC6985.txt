Sh. Abdul Rasheed, Advocate for the petitioner. 
 
Through this petition, the petitioner has assailed the 
orders dated 21.07.2025 and 18.09.2025, passed respectively by 
the learned Executing Court and the learned Additional District 
Judge, Layyah, whereby her objection petitions in the execution 
proceedings were dismissed. 
2. 
Facts in brief are that Respondent No.3 (Mst. Naheed 
Akhtar) obtained a decree of dower on 24.10.2022 from the 
learned Family Court, Layyah. The decree-holder initiated 
execution for possession of the decreed house. After delivery 
through the Court Bailiff, a report was submitted alleging 
extensive damage to the property. The learned Executing Court, 
through order dated 23.04.2024, directed assessment of loss by 
the XEN Buildings Department, which estimated the damage at 
Rs.11,30,434/- and ordered its recovery from the petitioner. The 
appellate court upheld that direction vide judgment dated 
04.06.2024. Both orders were challenged by the petitioner in 
W.P. No.7496/2024, which was disposed of on 25.11.2024, 
allowing her to file objections before the Executing Court. 
Thereafter the petitioner filed objections which were dismissed 
on 08.02.2025, and the appeal thereagainst met the same fate on 
02.05.2025. These concurrent findings were examined and 
upheld by this Court in W.P. No.5505/2025, dismissed on 
15.05.2025. Subsequently, the petitioner filed fresh objections, 

2 
W.P. No. 11074 of 2025 
 
which were again dismissed by the learned Executing Court on 
21.07.2025, and her revision was also dismissed by the learned 
Additional District Judge, Layyah, on 18.09.2025, giving rise to 
the present petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the 
petitioner was not a judgment debtor and therefore could not be 
subjected to recovery proceedings. It is urged that the impugned 
orders are without lawful authority, as the assessment of loss 
was arbitrary and conducted without associating the petitioner. 
It is further submitted that since a criminal case under Section 
380 PPC is pending regarding the same incident, the civil 
proceedings should have been withheld till its conclusion. 
4. 
The record reflects that both the courts below examined 
the matter comprehensively and reached concurrent conclusions 
supported by evidence and legal reasoning. The learned 
Executing Court, through its order dated 21.07.2025, observed 
that the petitioner’s fresh objections were a repetition of matters 
already adjudicated and that she failed to produce any material 
contradicting the departmental assessment or showing that the 
loss did not occur while the property was in her possession. The 
court emphasized that the petitioner and her brother had not 
only withheld cooperation with the Building Department but 
also failed to produce any expert or documentary proof to rebut 
the estimate. The learned Appellate Court, vide order dated 
18.09.2025, endorsed these findings, holding that the Executing 
Court acted well within its jurisdiction under Sections 47 and 
51 read with Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, 
and that the departmental assessment was properly obtained and 
based on a factual site inspection. 
5. 
It is a settled proposition that the Executing Court 
possesses full authority to enforce a decree and address all 
questions arising therefrom, including restitution and incidental 
compensation, provided such actions remain ancillary to the 
execution and not beyond the scope of the decree. The courts 

3 
W.P. No. 11074 of 2025 
 
below have rightly concluded that the assessed amount 
represents compensatory loss arising directly from the 
petitioner’s own acts during possession, rather than a 
modification or enlargement of the decree itself. 
6. 
The petitioner’s argument that the pendency of a criminal 
case bars the execution proceedings is untenable. The civil 
recovery of damages operates independently of any criminal 
liability and is governed by distinct legal principles. It has been 
repeatedly held that civil and criminal proceedings can run 
concurrently without prejudice to one another case The State 
through prosecutor General Punjab, Lahore vs. Chaudhry 
Mohammad Khan and others (PLD 2025 SC 254). The 
Executing Court’s decision, therefore, neither conflicts with nor 
preempts the outcome of the criminal case. 
7.  
The conduct of the petitioner throughout these 
proceedings has been neither diligent nor bona fide. Having 
availed multiple remedies and suffered concurrent adverse 
findings, she has persisted in invoking the extraordinary 
jurisdiction of this Court against successive and ancillary orders 
emanating from the same execution proceedings. Such conduct 
is reflective of a design to prolong litigation and obstruct the 
enforcement of a lawful decree rather than to redress any 
genuine grievance. The repeated filing of objections on 
identical or substantially similar grounds, already adjudicated 
upon by competent forums, squarely attracts the principle of 
constructive res judicata, which bars a party from re-agitating 
matters that were or could reasonably have been raised in 
earlier proceedings. This principle has been consistently 
recognized as a bar not only to suits but also to successive 
applications and petitions where the issues were available to be 
raised earlier. In Messrs New Rahat Engineering Works v. 
National Bank of Pakistan and another (2003 CLD 382 
[Lahore]) and Messrs Shezan Services (Pvt.) Ltd. through 
Assistant Accounts Officer vs. Federation of Pakistan through 

4 
W.P. No. 11074 of 2025 
 
Secretary, Ministry of Defence and 2 others (2011 CLC 1573), 
the august Court held that a litigant who omits to plead or 
pursue a material ground in earlier proceedings cannot later 
reopen the controversy under a new guise; the principle of 
constructive res judicata and the equity enshrined in Order II 
Rule 2 CPC preclude such repetitive or selective litigation. The 
same reasoning applies here—the petitioner’s successive 
objections are nothing more than a reiteration of pleas long 
settled by competent forums. This Court cannot permit its 
jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution to be invoked 
as a means of circumventing the finality of judicial 
determinations. A litigant approaching this Court must come 
with clean hands and fair intent; however, the petitioner’s 
pattern of conduct, marked by repetition, procedural defiance, 
non disclosure of dismissal of W.P.No. 5505 of 2025 before the 
Executing Court and disregard for final adjudications, 
demonstrates an intent to frustrate the decree-holder’s lawful 
entitlement under the guise of a fresh cause. 
8. 
The findings of both courts below are reasoned, 
supported by record, and consistent with the petitioner’s 
admitted possession and conduct. No violation of law, 
jurisdictional defect, or perversity has been demonstrated. It is 
also pertinent that the petitioner has been persistently invoking 
the writ jurisdiction of this Court against different stages of the 
same execution proceedings, despite earlier adjudication of 
similar issues. This repetitive litigation reflects misuse of the 
extraordinary constitutional remedy intended for exceptional 
circumstances, not as a substitute for appeal or review. 
9. 
The constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 
199 of the Constitution is discretionary and is not meant to 
reappraise concurrent findings of fact unless such findings are 
perverse, arbitrary, or based on no evidence. The impugned 
orders disclose due application of mind, procedural fairness, 
and correct exercise of jurisdiction, warranting no interference.

W.P. No. 11074 of 2025 
 
10. 
For the reasons discussed above, this writ petition is 
devoid of merit and stands dismissed in limine. The learned 
Executing Court is, however, directed to conclude the pending 
execution expeditiously. The Office shall transmit a copy of 
this order to the Court concerned for information and 
compliance.
