“If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on 
government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be 
administered by men over men, the great difference lies in this: you must 
first enable the government to control the governed, and in the next place 
oblige it to control itself.” 
     –  James Madison1 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. 
 
 
The Petitioner, a professional lawyer, has challenged the 
appointments of 22 officers (Respondents No.3 to 24) made in their own pay 
and scale (“OPS”) in the Punjab against various posts made through four 
notifications. He contends that the concept of OPS is alien to the law. 
Neither Punjab Civil Servants Act 1974 (“PCS Act”) nor Punjab Civil 
Servants (Appointments and Conditions of Service) Rules 1974  
(“PCS Rules”) allows such appointments. He argues that it is an artifice to 
favour blue-eyed officers and breeds a culture of nepotism and favouritism.

OPS connotes appointing a civil servant against a post higher in 
scale than his basic pay scale. For example, appointing a BS-19 officer 
against a BS-20 or a higher position. 
3. 
 
This Court admitted this petition to a regular hearing by order 
dated 20.09.2022 and directed the Respondents to file written statements. 
Since this petition involved important questions requiring interpretation of 
the Constitution and statutory law, notice was also issued to the Advocate 
General Punjab under Order XXVII-A CPC. 
4. 
 
The Government submitted its written statement strongly 
opposing this petition. It contends that the Petitioner lacks locus standi to 
file it because he is not an aggrieved person within the meaning of Article 
199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973  
(the “Constitution”). Furthermore, it is mala fide and based on ulterior 
motives. According to the Government, there is a severe scarcity of officers 
in BS-19 and above. It has repeatedly requested the Establishment Division, 
Government of Pakistan, Islamabad, to post officers of the Pakistan 
Administrative Service as per its share in the provincial sub-cadre. However, 
the Federal Government is also short on officers, so the Establishment 
Division could not post the requisite number of officers in the Punjab. In 
these circumstances, the Punjab Government is occasionally constrained to 
post “suitable/competent officers” on an OPS basis in the public interest to 
manage public affairs and ensure that the administration runs smoothly. 
Such appointments are permitted under the Service and General 
Administration Department’s Notification No.SOR.I(S&GAD)-16-70/77 
dated 17.05.1982, and the Finance Department’s Office Memorandum 
No.F.8(4)R-2/97-1204/ 2009 dated 24.02.2009 and Policy Letter dated 
16.12.2009. The Government has further stated that seniority, service record, 
integrity, experience/ achievements, qualifications and recommendations, if 
any, from any department/organization are all taken into account when 
making OPS appointments. 
5. 
 
The Government has defended the OPS postings of 
Respondents Nos. 3 to 24, claiming that the Competent Authority appointed 
them in conformity with law and policy and that they are in the public 
interest.

6. 
 
Although notices were issued to all the respondent officers, 
only Respondents No.12, 15, and 24 have submitted their written statements. 
According to them, section 9 of the PCS Act mandates that every civil 
servant shall be liable to serve anywhere within or outside the province and 
in any post under the Government of the Punjab, the Federal Government, 
any Provincial Government or a local authority or a corporation or a body 
set up or established by any such Government. They state that they have 
assumed charge of their current posts in compliance with the orders issued 
by the Competent Authority, which are in accordance with the law, rules and 
policy. 
7. 
 
On 13.01.2023, this Court directed the Chief Secretary of the 
Punjab to furnish a list of all the officers posted on the OPS basis in the 
province. His report revealed that currently there are 183 such officers, 
including Respondents No.3 to 24. On 09.02.2023, this Court directed the 
office to issue them notices to be served through the Chief Secretary. It 
further directed that the officers in question file a reply/written statement to 
this petition, if so advised. On 17.02.2023, Ahmed Hassan Shahzad, Deputy 
Secretary, Service and General Administration Department (S&GAD), 
submitted a report confirming that the Chief Secretary has issued notices to 
the aforesaid officers. None of them has joined these proceedings except 
three whom the Petitioner had arrayed as Respondents No. 12, 15 and 24. 
8. 
 
On 24.02.2023, this Court appointed Mr Muhammad Shahzad 
Shaukat, Advocate, as amicus curiae. 
Advocate General’s submissions 
9. 
 
Mr Muhammad Shan Gul, Advocate General Punjab, has 
submitted a written note in response to the notice under Order XXVII-A 
CPC and addressed the Court on 09.03.2023. According to him, the PCS Act 
and the PCS Rules did not originally include any provision for appointing 
junior officers to higher-level positions. However, due to the necessity and 
unavailability of officers of proper scale, the Government was sometimes 
compelled to nominate officers of lower level to higher offices. This stop-
gap arrangement did not grant them the right to receive pay/salary of the 
higher scale or seniority, so such appointments were termed “own pay and 

Writ Petition No. 63900/2021 
 
- 4 - 
scale” appointments. On 17.05.1982, S&GAD issued Notification 
No.SOR.I(S&GAD)-16-70/77 to streamline the procedure for such 
appointments. Subsequently, the Government determined that the said 
notification was insufficient to provide the proper legal mandate for OPS 
appointments, so it inserted Rule 10-A in PCS Rules vide Notification No. 
SOR-III-1-14/75 dated 26.02.1983. Rule 10-A caters to two situations:  
(a) when the post is to be filled by departmental promotion, and (ii) when the 
post is to be filled through initial recruitment. In both cases, it provides that 
the most senior officer eligible for promotion should be appointed. Mr Gul 
submits that the Government always strives to ensure that the officers of the 
right grade are posted against vacant seats, but where the unavailability of 
suitable officers poses a hurdle, the senior-most officer of the lower scale 
might be posted. Through Notification No. SOR.I(S&GAD)16-70/77-1 
dated 01.05.2000, S&GAD called for strict adherence to the procedure laid 
down in Rule 10-A. Mr Gul points out that Rule 10-A is not the only 
provision that allows for a deviation from the normal and preferred method 
of appointment of suitable officers. Rule 10-B of the PCS Rules  
(inserted on 04.09.1994) authorizes appointment on a current charge basis of 
the most senior available civil servant (eligible for promotion) if the post 
(should be filled) is expected to remain vacant for less than a year. Rule 13 
also permits that if a post becomes vacant due to deputation, posting outside 
cadre, leave, suspension or appointment on acting charge basis of the 
incumbent, the most senior civil servant can be appointed by promotion on 
officiating basis. 
10. 
 
The Advocate General contends that the instructions issued by 
the Government and notified in the Esta Code are considered statutory and 
have the force of law. Hence, the appointments of officers in their own pay 
and scale, which are made in accordance with the instructions contained in 
notifications dated 17.05.1982 and 01.05.2000, are unexceptionable. He has 
relied upon Khan Faizullah Khan v. Government of Pakistan through the 
Establishment 
Secretary, 
Cabinet 
Secretariat, 
and 
another  
(PLD 1974 SC 291), Muhammad Afzal and another v. Government of 
Balochistan through Secretary, Services and General Administration 
Department, Quetta and others [1995 PLC (C.S.) 567], and Fazali

Rehmani v. Chief Minister, N.W.F.P.  and others (PLD 2008 SC 769) in 
support of his argument regarding the legal status of the aforesaid 
instructions. 
11. 
 
The Advocate General concludes that the term “own pay and 
scale” is only used to assert that there is no right to claim either the higher 
post’s salary or seniority from the date of appointment to the higher scale. 
This expression is only used to make the appointee aware of the conditions 
mentioned in Rule 10-A(5), which states: 
(5) 
No appointment on acting charge basis shall be made without the 
recommendations of the Departmental Promotion Committee or the 
Provincial Selection Board as the case may be, but such appointment shall 
not be deemed to have been made on a regular basis for any purpose nor 
shall confer any right for regular appointment.  
Submissions of the amicus curiae 
12. 
 
Mr Muhammad Shahzad Shaukat, Advocate, submits that the 
PCS Rules provide a comprehensive mechanism that should be adopted 
when a post is required to be filled and no suitable officer is available for 
appointment. The concept of OPS has no legal backing. He has pointed out 
that in paragraph-3 of the notification dated 01.05.2000, S&GAD declared 
that “appointment to a higher post in own pay and grade has no meaning in 
law, therefore, this practice should be discontinued.” In these circumstances, 
all OPS appointments are illegal and without lawful authority, and the 
Government should be permanently restrained from making such 
appointments. He agrees with the Petitioner’s counsel that it spawns 
nepotism and favouritism, eventually leading to bad governance. 
Opinion of the Court 
13. 
 
The Government has objected to the maintainability of this 
petition. I must address this issue first. 
14. 
 
The present petition is in the nature of Public Interest Litigation 
(“PIL”). Halsbury’s Laws of India states that “lexically, the expression 
‘public interest litigation’ means a legal action initiated in a court of law for 
the enforcement of public or general interest in which the public or a class of 
the community have pecuniary interest or some interest by which their legal 

Writ Petition No. 63900/2021 
 
- 6 - 
rights or liability are affected.”2 Dr Faqir Hussain states that “the raison 
d'être of public interest litigation is to break through the existing legal, 
technical, and procedural constraints and provide justice, particularly social 
justice, to a particular individual, class, or community who, on account of 
any personal deficiency or economic or social deprivation or State 
oppression are prevented from bringing a claim before the court of law.”3 
The courts consider PIL a “part of the process of participative justice”4 and 
an extremely important jurisdiction.5  
15. 
 
In law, “locus standi means the right to bring an action, to be 
heard in court, or to address the court on a matter before it. Locus standi  
is the ability of a party to demonstrate to the court sufficient connection to 
and harm from the law or action challenged to support that party’s 
participation in the case.”6 In S.P. Gupta vs President of India and others 
[1981 Supp. SCC 87 : AIR 1982 SC 149)], the Supreme Court of India held 
that the traditional rule regarding locus standi is that judicial redress is 
available only to a person who has suffered a legal injury to property, body, 
mind or reputation as a result of any violation, actual or threatened, of the 
legal right or legally protected interest. This principle is, however, relaxed 
where an act or omission of the State or a public authority in violation of the 
Constitution or the law causes a public wrong or public injury. In such 
instances, any member of the public acting in good faith, who is not merely 
a busybody or a meddling interloper, but has sufficient interest in the 
proceeding, may file an action. The threat of legal action will compel public 
officials to act with greater responsibility and care, thereby improving the 
administration of justice. The Supreme Court also cited the following 
observations of Lord Diplock from Rex v. Inland Revenue Commrs.  
(1981) 2 WLR 722 (at p.740):

“It would, in my view, be a grave lacuna in our system of public law if a 
pressure group, like the federation, or even a single public-spirited 
taxpayer, were prevented by outdated technical rules of locus standi from 
bringing the matter to the attention of the court to vindicate the rule of law 
and get the unlawful conduct stopped ... It is not, in my view, a sufficient 
answer to say that judicial review of the actions of officers or departments 
of central government is unnecessary because they are accountable to 
Parliament for the way in which they carry out their functions. They are 
accountable to Parliament for what they do so far as regards efficiency and 
policy, and of that Parliament is the only judge; they are responsible to a 
Court of Justice for the lawfulness of what they do, and of that the court is 
the only judge.” 
16. 
 
Nonetheless, the courts have always emphasized that they 
should not allow their process to be abused through PILs. In S.P. Gupta, the 
Supreme Court of India stated that the court must ensure it is bonafide and 
not for personal gain, private profit, political motivation, or any other 
oblique consideration.7 In Javed Ibrahim Paracha v. Federation of 
Pakistan and others (PLD 2004 SC 482), the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
held that a person could invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of the superior 
courts as pro bono publico, but he must first demonstrate that he is 
prosecuting in the public interest and for the public good, or the welfare of 
the general public.8 In Muhammad Shafique Khan Sawati v. Federation of 
Pakistan (2015 SCMR 851), the apex Court emphasized that in a PIL action, 
a citizen must demonstrate that it is bonafide and that he is pursuing it to 
promote public welfare, not private or vested interest. In Premier Battery 
Industries Private Limited v. Karachi Water & Sewerage Board and others 
(2018 SCMR 365), the Supreme Court held that PIL had received judicial 
recognition enabling the courts to enlarge the scope of the meaning of 
“aggrieved person” under Article 199 of the Constitution of 1973 to include 
a public-spirited person who brings to the court’s notice a matter of public 
importance requiring enforcement of fundamental rights. However, the 
superior courts should exercise constitutional jurisdiction with care, 
prudence, and circumspection. They should not take on any speculative, 
hypothetical, or malicious litigation that would obstruct the Government 
from performing its executive functions. 
                                          
7 The Supreme Court of India reiterated this view in Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary and others  
[AIR 1993 SC 892 : 1992 (4) 4 SCC 305], and Dr. B. Singh vs Union Of India and others  
[(2004) 3 SCC 363]. 
8 This case was cited with approval in Moulvi Iqbal Haider v. Capital Development Authority and others 
(PLD 2006 SC 394). 

Writ Petition No. 63900/2021

17. 
 
The Petitioner seeks a writ of quo warranto through this 
petition. In such cases, as we shall see in the next few paragraphs, the 
principle of locus standi is further relaxed. Halsbury’s Laws of India 
explains quo warranto as follows:9 
“Quo warranto proceeding affords a judicial remedy by which any 
person, who holds an independent substantive public office or franchise 
or liberty, is called upon to show by what right he holds the said office, 
franchise or liberty so that his title to it may be duly determined, and in 
case the finding is that the holder of the office has no title, he would be 
ousted from that office by judicial order. In other words, the procedure 
of quo warranto gives the judiciary a weapon to control the executive 
from making appointments to public office against the law and to 
protect a citizen from being deprived of public office to which he has a 
right. These proceedings also tend to protect the public from usurpers 
of public office, who might be allowed to continue either with the 
connivance of the executive or by reason of its apathy.”10 
18. 
 
The Constitution of Pakistan (1973) empowers the High Court 
under Article 199(1)(ii)(b) to issue an order “requiring a person within the 
territorial jurisdiction of the Court holding a public office to show under 
what authority of law he claims to hold that office.” The Constitution 
expressly states that the individual applying for an order under the said 
Article need not be an “aggrieved person”. In Malik Asad Ali and others v. 
Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 1998 SC 161), the Supreme Court 
ruled that quo warranto proceedings confer jurisdiction and authority on 
superior courts to control executive action in making appointments to public 
offices against the relevant statutory provisions. These proceedings are a 
bulwark against usurpers of public offices, who may be allowed to occupy 
positions in connivance or with the help of the executive authority in some 
cases. In Jawad Ahmad Mir v. Prof. Dr. Imtiaz Ali Khan, Vice 
Chancellor, University of Swabi, and others (2023 SCMR 162), the 
Supreme Court held that there is no legal necessity that the person applying 
for a writ of quo warranto should be an “aggrieved person” in the literal 
sense. Further, he is not required to demonstrate that he has a special interest 
in the matter or to explain which of his legal rights has been infringed. It is 
enough that the relator is a member of the public and acts bonafide. This writ 
is more akin to public interest litigation, in which an individual seeks to 
remedy a wrong or vindicate a right for himself, for the good of society, or 
                                          
9 Halsbury’s Laws of India, Vol.35, p.145 
10 The Supreme Court of Pakistan approvingly cited this excerpt in Jawad Ahmad Mir v. Prof. Dr. Imtiaz 
Ali Khan, Vice Chancellor, University of Swabi, and others (2023 SCMR 162).

as a matter of principle. In Barrister Sardar Muhammad v. Federation of 
Pakistan and others (PLD 2013 Lahore 343), a learned Judge of this Court 
stated: 
“The object of this constitutional remedy is to protect the sanctity of the 
‘public office’ by safeguarding against unlawful appointments. The 
constitutional objective appears to be more institutional. Acting as 
gatekeepers, the constitutional courts protect the sanctity of a ‘public 
office’ and, as a result, shield public institutions from usurpers. The 
constitutional obligation is to ensure that persons selected to man public 
institutions are appointed in accordance with the law without the slightest 
taint of impropriety. It is also a constitutional platform for the ‘whistle-
blowers’ to come forward in public interest and raise their concern about 
wrongdoing within organizations.11 The result is that institutions/ 
organizations are more open and accountable to their employees, 
shareholders and the greater public in their activities.”  
19. 
 
I may now refer to a few cases which outline the nature and 
scope of quo warranto proceeding. In Salahuddin and others v. Frontier 
Sugar Mills & Distillery Ltd. and others (PLD 1975 SC 244), the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan held that in a petition for issuance of a writ of  
quo warranto the High Court can only grant a declaration as to the person’s 
authority to hold the questioned post but cannot issue a mandamus to restore 
or reinstate the applicant to office. In Pakistan Tobacco Board and another 
v. Tahir Raza and others (2007 SCMR 97), the Supreme Court stated that  
quo warranto proceedings are inquisitorial rather than adversarial, not only 
because a relator does not have to be a person aggrieved but also because a 
person who holds public office without a legal warrant is burdening the 
public exchequer and causing harm to others who may be entitled to the said 
office. The High Court can conduct such inquiry as it deems necessary in the 
facts and circumstances of a particular case, including an examination of the 
entire relevant record. This exercise can be done suo motu even if the parties 
concerned do not draw its attention to it. In Capt. (Retd) Muhammad 
Naseem Hijazi v. Province of Punjab and others (2000 SCMR 1720), the 
Supreme Court held that on any such plea, the court must not only determine 
whether the respondent is holding the office under the order of competent 
authority, but also whether he is legally qualified for it or to continue to hold 
it, and whether any statutory provision has been violated in making the 
appointment. In Muhammad Hanif Abbasi v. Jahangir Khan Tareen and 
                                          
11 See: UK Committee on Standards in Public Life quoted in “The Status of Whistleblowing in South 
Africa”-Taking Stock- Patricia Martin. 

Writ Petition No. 63900/2021

others (PLD 2018 SC 114), the Supreme Court ruled that the writ of  
quo warranto is discretionary, and the High Court is competent to inquire 
into the motives and conduct of the person challenging public office 
appointments. The relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
“There can be no cavil with the principle that to grant the relief in the 
nature of quo warranto is within the discretionary power of the superior 
Courts, it should not be allowed as a matter of course, rather the conduct 
and the bona fides of the relator, the cause and the object of filing such 
petition is of considerable importance and should be examined; it should 
be ascertained if the petition has been filed with some mala fide intent or 
ulterior motive and to serve the purpose of someone else. We are of the 
considered view that quo warranto remedy should not be allowed to be a 
tool in the hands of the relators, who approach the court with mala fide 
intentions and either have their own personal grudges and scores to settle 
with the holder of the public office or are a proxy for someone else who 
has a similar object or motive.”12 
20. 
 
The Petitioner is a practising advocate and citizen of Pakistan. 
In Malik Asad Ali and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others  
(PLD 1998 SC 161), the Supreme Court held that such a person has the 
essential locus standi to file the petition. The Respondents have alleged that 
this petition is mala fide, but have not brought any material on record to 
substantiate that allegation. The expression “mala fide” has a definite 
significance in legal phraseology. The same cannot possibly emanate out of 
fanciful imagination or even apprehensions. There must exist indisputable 
evidence of an oblique motive. It is a settled law that mala fides must be 
pleaded with particularity.13 Vague and general allegations are not 
acceptable.14 The court cannot conduct a roving inquiry to “fish out” a 
case.15

21. 
 
In light of the above discussion, I hold this petition 
maintainable. 
22. 
 
Let’s now turn to the merits of the case. Section 4 of the PCS 
Act ordains that appointments to the civil service of the province or a civil 
post in connection with the affairs of the province shall be made in the 
prescribed manner by the Governor or by a person authorized by him on that 
behalf. Part-II of the PCS Rules defines the procedure for appointments to 
posts in the civil service of Punjab by promotion. Part-III and Part-IV deal 
with initial and ad-hoc appointments, respectively, and Part-V with 
relaxations. Rule 9 ordains that promotions or transfers to posts in various 
grades shall be made on the recommendation of the appropriate Committee 
or Board. Rule 10 states that the Selection Authority shall consider only 
officers with the prescribed qualifications and meet the conditions stipulated 
for this purpose. The crux of these provisions is that only the right officer 
can be posted to a particular position. A BS-19 officer shall be posted only 
against a BS-19 position and not to a higher one. 
23. 
 
Rules 10-A, 10-B, and 13 provide for appointments on acting 
charge, current charge, and officiating basis to deal with various 
contingencies when a post becomes vacant. These Rules are reproduced in 
Appendix-I for ready reference. It is important to note that the seniority 
principle is followed in every case, subject to the conditions/criteria outlined 
in these provisions. The PCS Rules, including Rules 10-A, 10-B and 13, do 
not allow for appointments on an OPS basis.  
24. 
 
The Government maintains that OPS is a stop-gap arrangement 
and draws on S&GAD’s notifications dated 17.05.1982, 17.08.1988 and 
01.05.2000 (Appendix-II) and the Finance Department’s Memorandum 
dated 24.2.2009 and Policy Letter dated 16.12.2009 (Appendix-III) to claim 
a legal mandate for it. I am afraid, they are of little help to it because 
S&GAD’s notifications talk of “Officiating arrangements against posts 
pending regular appointment” and specifically declare that “appointment 
to higher post in own pay and grade has no meaning in law” and that “such 
arrangements are not envisaged in law.”

S&GAD’s 
notification 
dated 
17.05.1982 
states 
that 
appointments to higher posts, even as a stop-gap measure, should be made 
with the Appointing Authority’s approval. If appointment to higher posts is 
not possible for any reason, the senior-most eligible officer should be 
assigned additional charge of the higher post. S&GAD’s notification dated 
01.05.2000 directs that the practice of making appointments on an OPS basis 
should be discontinued. A position should be filled up according to the 
prescribed procedure as soon as it becomes available. If that is not possible 
for any reason, stop-gap appointments should be made only per Rules 10-A, 
10-B and 13 of the PCS Rules. These instructions have statutory force in 
terms of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Khan Faizullah Khan 
v. Government of Pakistan through the Establishment Secretary, Cabinet 
Secretariat and another (PLD 1974 SC 291). The relevant excerpt is 
reproduced below: 
“This Court has stated on several occasions that even instructions 
contained in Memoranda issued by the appropriate Government could be 
regarded as being in the nature of statutory rules provided they are 
expressed with precision and yet possess generality so as to be capable on 
application to a large number of cases – See: Pakistan v. Abdul Hamid 
(PLD 1961 SC 105), Province of West Pakistan v. Din Muhammad (PLD 
1964 SC 21), Government of West Pakistan v. A. A. Aziz (PLD 1966 SC 
188) and Habibur Rehman v. West Pakistan Public Service Commission  
(PLD 1973 SC 144).” 
26. 
 
The phrase “in own pay and scale” prima facie implies that the 
lower-grade officer appointed to a higher-grade post receives no additional 
salary benefits. Surprisingly, the Finance Department’s Memorandum dated 
24.2.2009 grants them to such officers, in addition to the perks and 
privileges that come with the higher position. As a result, the very concept of 
OPS is negated. According to the Memorandum, the salary of the higher 
post will be fixed presumptively w.e.f. the date the officer assumes charge of 
the higher post, and it will include the increments of the higher post’s pay 
scale during the period of the higher post appointment. Premature increment 
is not admissible in such cases, but the officer is entitled to the arrears of pay 
and allowances from the date he assumes the charge of the higher post. The 
salary of the higher position is not taken into account while calculating 
emoluments towards the pension. 
27. 
 
The courts have considered the issue of OPS in several cases. In 

Writ Petition No. 63900/2021 
 
- 13 -
Province of Sindh and others v. Ghulam Fareed and others  
(2014 SCMR 1189), while dealing with a case under the Sindh Civil 
Servants Act 1973, which is analogous to the PCS Act, the Supreme Court 
stated: 
“We have inquired from the learned Additional Advocate General to show 
us any provision of law and or rule under which a civil servant can be 
appointed on higher grade/post on OPS basis. He concedes that there is no 
specific provision in the law or rule which permits appointment on OPS 
basis. He, however, submitted that in exigencies, the Government makes 
such appointments as a stop-gap arrangement. We have examined the 
provisions of Sindh Civil Servants Act and the Rules framed thereunder. 
We do not find any provision which could authorize the Government or 
Competent Authority to appoint any officer on a higher grade on “Own 
Pay And Scale Basis.” Appointment of the nature that, too, of a junior 
officer causes heart burning of the senior officers within the cadre and or 
department. This practice of appointment on OPS basis to a higher grade 
has always been discouraged by this Court, as it does not have any 
sanction of law, besides it impinges the self-respect and dignity of the civil 
servants who are forced to work under their rapidly and unduly appointed 
fellow officers junior to them. Discretion of the nature, if allowed to be 
vested in the Competent Authority, will offend valuable rights of the 
meritorious civil servants besides blocking promotions of the deserving 
officers.” 
The Supreme Court went on to say: 
“At times, officers possessing the requisite experience to qualify for a 
regular appointment may not be available in a department. However, all 
such exigencies are taken care of and regulated by statutory rules ... 
Looking at the scheme of the Sindh Civil Servants Act and Rules framed 
thereunder, it is crystal clear that there is no scope for appointment of a 
civil servant to a higher grade on OPS basis except resorting to the 
provisions of Rule 8-A,16 which provides that in exigencies, appointment 
on acting charge basis can be made, subject to conditions contained in the 
Rules.” 
 
The above judgment was cited approvingly in Khan 
Muhammad v. Chief Secretary, Government of Balochistan and others  
(2018 SCMR 1411), which reaffirmed that posting and transferring civil 
servants on an OPS basis is legally not permissible. 
28. 
 
In Mian Zia-ud-Din v. Secretary Local Government  
[2005 PLC (CS) 908], this Court observed that public employment is no 
longer a bounty of the State or its functionaries. The rule of law is a 
cherished goal of any civilized society, and it will remain an illusion if abuse 
of administrative authority continues unchecked. Rules 10-A, 10-B and 13 
of the PCS Rules and S&GAD’s notifications offer a detailed framework for 
                                          
16 Rule 8-A of the Sindh Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion & Transfer) Rules 1974 is analogous to 
Rule 10-A of the Punjab Civil Servants (Appointments and Conditions of Service) Rules 1974.

stop-gap solutions that must always be adhered to. In Bashir Ahmed 
Badini, D&SJ, Dera Allah Yar and others v. Hon’ble Chairman and 
Members of Administration Committee and Promotion Committee of 
Hon’ble High Court of Balochistan and others (2022 SCMR 448), the 
Supreme Court emphasized: 
“In the case of Tariq Aziz-ud-Din and others (In re: Human Rights Case 
Nos. 8340,9504-G, 13936-G, 13635-P and 14306-G to 143309-G of 
2009) (2010 SCMR 1301), this Court held that in case where the 
appointing authority is satisfied that no suitable officer is available to 
fill the post and it is expedient to fill the same, it may appoint to that 
post on acting charge basis the most senior officer otherwise eligible 
for promotion in the cadre or service as the case may be. It is the duty 
and obligation of the competent authority to consider the merit of all 
the eligible candidates while putting them in juxtaposition to isolate the 
meritorious amongst them. Expression ‘merit’ includes limitations 
prescribed under the law. Discretion is to be exercised according to 
rational reasons, which means that (a) there be a finding of primary 
facts based on good evidence, and (b) decisions about facts be made for 
reasons which serve the purposes of the statute in an intelligible and 
reasonable manner. Actions which do not meet these threshold 
requirements are considered arbitrary and misuse of power.” 
29. 
 
Appointments on a current or acting charge basis should not 
continue indefinitely, and every effort should be made to fill posts through 
regular appointments in the shortest possible time. In Province of Sindh 
through Chief Secretary and others v. Ghulam Shabbir and others  
(2023 SCMR 686), the Supreme Court held that allowing the assignment of 
duties on an acting charge basis to continue indefinitely amounts to 
deflecting and frustrating the spirit of the Rules. The competent authority is 
obligated to decide the fate of an acting charge holder by the deadline 
specified in the Rules. Stretching or continuing acting charge or ad-hoc 
arrangement on OPS basis for an extended period raises misgivings and is 
highly disruptive and detrimental to the structure of civil service. 
30. 
 
According to the report submitted by the Chief Secretary in 
terms of order dated 13.01.2023, the Government has currently posted 183 
officers, including Respondents No.3 to 24, on the OPS basis in the Punjab. 
A review of the list he has furnished reflects that several BS-18 officers have 
been posted against BS-20 and at least three BS-19 officers against BS-21 
posts. The Chief Secretary has not placed on record any evidence that all 
these officers were senior-most and otherwise eligible for promotion in the 
cadre or service, as the case may be, and thus entitled to the posts they hold. 

Writ Petition No. 63900/2021

Prima facie, the law has been flouted with impunity. Respondents No.12, 15 
& 24 have submitted copies of their posting orders, which do not even 
mention that the appointment is temporary. Presumably, the posting orders 
of the other officers appearing in the aforementioned list would be in the 
same language. 
31. 
 
“Good governance is essential to development, prosperity and 
peace.”17 It gives every citizen, young or old, man or woman, a real and 
lasting stake in the future of their societies – politically, economically, and 
socially. With that stake in their minds and hearts, there are no limits to what 
the people of a country can achieve.18 The Supreme Court observed in  
Tariq Aziz-ud-Din that good governance largely depends on an upright, 
honest, strong bureaucracy. The purity of administration is greatly 
influenced by the purity of the services, which is only possible if promotions 
[postings and transfers] are made on merit in conformity with the 
Constitution and the law and without favouritism or nepotism. Institutions 
are destroyed when appointments and promotions are made contravening the 
law. The Supreme Court further stated that when we talk about public 
interest and the welfare of the State, we have the principles of the rule of law 
and access to justice for all in our minds, which are enshrined in our 
Constitution. In Syed Mahmood Akhtar Naqvi and others v. Federation of 
Pakistan and others (PLD 2013 SC 195), the Supreme Court determined 
that tenure, appointment, promotion and posting/transfer are crucial in 
the civil service. If rules and instructions are violated, and merit is 
discouraged by favouritism, sifarish or other motives, the civil service 
will lose its independence. In Province of Sindh through Chief Secretary 
and others v. Ghulam Shabbir and others (2023 SCMR 686), the 
Supreme Court held the term “civil service” refers to a branch of 
government that consists of career bureaucrats recruited on merit. The 
improper selection of blue-eyed boys based on nepotism, favouritism, or 
other extraneous considerations creates dissatisfaction and resentment 
among civil servants, with long-term serious consequences. Merit should be

Declarations and directives 
32. 
 
This petition is disposed of with the following declarations and 
directives: 
(i) 
It is declared that the concept of OPS appointments is 
alien to law. It violates Articles 4 and 25, the PCS Act 
and the PCS Rules. S&GAD’s notifications dated 
17.05.1982 and 01.05.2000 also declare that it has no 
legal basis.  
(ii) 
As soon as a post becomes available, it should be filled 
up in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the 
relevant service/recruitment rules. If that is not possible 
for any reason, stop-gap appointments should be made 
only following the procedure laid down for the respective 
categories of the vacancy under Rules 10-A, 10-B and 13 
of the PCS Rules (read with S&GAD’s notifications 
dated 17.05.1982 and 01.05.2000). 
(iii) 
There is no scope for appointment of a civil servant to a 
higher grade on an OPS basis except resorting to the 
provisions of Rule 10-A, which provides that in 
exigencies, an appointment on an acting charge basis can 
be made, subject to the conditions contained in the PCS 
Rules.  
(iv) 
The 
Chief 
Secretary 
Punjab 
shall 
review 
the 
appointments of the 183 officers named in the list which 
he furnished to this Court in terms of the order dated 
13.01.2023 
and 
shall, 
within 
30 
days 
of 
the 
announcement of this judgment, take appropriate steps to 
bring them into compliance with the law, if any deviation 
exists.

(Appointments and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1974 
 
10-A. Appointment on acting charge basis.– (1) Appointments on acting charge basis 
may be made in the manner hereinafter prescribed. 
(2) 
Where the appointing authority considers it to be in the public interest to fill a 
post reserved under the rules for departmental promotion and the most senior civil 
servant belonging to the cadre or service concerned who is otherwise eligible for

to that post on acting charge basis. 
(3) 
Where the appointing authority is satisfied on report of the selecting authority that 
no suitable officer is available to fill a post Grade 17 and above reserved under the rules

unfilled, it may appoint to that post on acting charge basis the most senior officer eligible 
for promotion to that post. 
(4) 
No appointment on acting charge basis shall be made against a post which is 
likely to remain vacant for a period of less than six months. 
(5) 
No appointment on acting charge basis shall be made without the 
recommendations of the Departmental Promotion Committee or the Provincial Selection 
Board, as the case may be, but such appointment shall not be deemed to have been made 
on regular basis for any purpose nor shall confer any right for regular appointment. 
10-B. Appointment on current charge basis.– (1) Where a post is likely to remain 
vacant for a period of less than one year and the appointing authority does not consider it 
expedient to make an appointment on ad hoc basis, it may appoint any civil servant to

Subject: 
OFFICIATING ARRANGEMENTS AGAINST POSTS PENDING 
REGULAR APPOINTMENT 
 
 
 
I am directed to refer to this Department’s circular letter of even number 
dated 23.07.1979 on the subject noted above and to state that it has been observed that 
stop-gap arrangements are still being made by posting members of next below cadres 
against higher posts in their own pay and scale. Once such postings are made the 
concerned officials represent for grant of pay of the post and such requests are passed on 
by the Administrative Departments to the Finance Department for concurrence. Since 
such arrangements are not envisaged by law, the Administrative Departments and 
appointing authorities under their administration should keep the allowing instructions in 
mind before any stop-gap arrangements is made. The appointing authorities shall be held 
personally responsible for posting of any person against a higher post in disregard to 
these instructions: 
i) 
appointment to higher post in own pay and grade has no meaning 
in law; 
ii) 
appointment to higher posts even as a stop-gap arrangement should 
be made with the approval of the Appointing Authority i.e. 
Administrative Secretary for posts in grade 17 and Chief Secretary 
for posts in grade 18 and Governor for posts in grade 19 and 
above; 
iii) 
in case where appointment to higher posts is not possible for one 
reason or the other the senior-most eligible officer should be given 
additional charge of the higher post instead of appointing him to 
the said higher post.

APPOINTMENT BY PROMOTION ON OFFICIATING BASIS 
 
  
 
I am to refer to S&GAD Notification No. SOR.IV(S&GAD) 
1-14/75 dated 12th March, 1985 amending Rule 13 of the Punjab Civil Servants 
(Appointment & Conditions of Service) Rules, 1974, copy of which has been sent to all 
departments under endorsement of even number dated 14th March, 1985. According to 
the amended Rule 13(ii) ibid, no person shall be promoted on officiating basis unless he 
possesses the qualifications and experience prescribed for the post and his promotion as 
such is approved by the chairman of appropriate selection authority. Under rule 9(1) of 
the Punjab Civil Servants (Appointment & Conditions of Service) Rules, 1974, 
appointments by promotions or transfer to posts in various grades shall be made on the 
recommendations of the appropriate committee or board. Officiating promotion has all 
the attributes of regular promotion, except that it is for a specified period and is 
temporary in nature. It is, therefore, clarified that all promotions on officiating basis 
should be made on the recommendations of the appropriate selection authority.

OFFICE MEMORANDUM 
 
Suject: 
Appointment of an Officer of Lower Grade to a Post of Higher Grade 
and Grant of Pay of the Higher Post 
 
  
 
In partial modification of Finance Division’s Office Memorandum 
No.8(4)R-2/97 dated 19th September, 2003 on the above subject, the undersigned is 
directed to say that the courts have held from time to time that where a civil servant is 
called upon to discharge dütles and responsibilities of a higher post, he is entitled to pay 
of that higher post. The Law, Justice and Human Rights Division in their Office 
Memorandum No. F.3(9)/81 Sol. II dated 18 March, 1986 issued necessary guidelines in 
that regard. To further clarify the matter, it has been decided that pay of the higher post 
will be admissible to civil servants during the period of appointment on higher post 
subject to the following conditions: 
(i) 
The officer has been appointed on the higher post by the authority 
competent to make appointment on that post. 
(ii) 
The officer is fully qualified in every respect to be appointed to 
that higher post. 
(iii) 
The officer discharges all the duties and responsibilities of the 
higher post independently and severed all connections with his 
lower post. 
(iv) 
The pay of the higher post will be fixed presumptively w.e.f. the 
date the officer assumes charge of the higher post and it will 
include the increments of the pay scale of the higher post for the 
period of higher post appointment on that post. In such cases 
premature increment shall not be admissible. However, the officer 
will be entitled to the arrears of pay and allowances from the date 
he assumes the charge of the higher post. 
(v) 
On relinquishment of charge of the higher post or on transfer or on 
regular promotion to that higher post, the pay will be re-fixed with 
reference to original scale of pay of the post, held by the officer 
and increments carried (if any) on higher post will count for 
increments in his original scale as per provisions of FR-26. 
(vi) 
The pay of the higher post shall not be accounted for the 
calculation of emoluments towards the pension. 
(vii) 
The pay of the higher post will be given only with the concurrence 
of Finance Division. 
2. 
 
All Ministries/Divisions/Departments are advised that only those cases 
may be referred to Finance Division which are covered under sub-paras (i) to (iii) of
