Date of hearings

Plaintiff(s) by  
M/s Muhammad Imran Malik, ASC, Aakif 
Majeed and Asim Tufail Farooqi, Advocates. 
Defendant(s) by 
Ms. Samia Faiz Durrani, ASC, Faiz Durani, 
ASC with Salman Khan Baryalay and 
Arshad Mehmood, Advocate. 
 
  
JAWAD HASSAN, J. This suit was filed under Section 9 of 
the Financial Institution (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (the 
“Ordinance”) claiming multiple reliefs including recovery of Rs.285 
million with up-to-date profit against the Defendant due to  
non-fulfillment of obligations and breach of sanctioned finance 
facilities.   
2.  
In response to the suit, the Defendant filed PLA under Section 
10 of the “Ordinance” and primarily objected to maintainability of 
the suit on the ground that the suit is not maintainable on the score of 
territorial jurisdiction in view of Clause 12 of the Musharakah 
Agreement dated 27.05.2022 (the “Agreement”).  
3.  
Arguments have been heard in detail on the question of 
jurisdiction.  
I. 
Question of Jurisdiction  
4. 
Learned counsel for the Defendant Ms. Samia Faiz Durrani, 
ASC on 11.12.2023 objected to maintainability of the suit on the 
question of law and argued the case on 26.02.2024 and 26.03.2024 
regarding the jurisdiction of Courts at Karachi in term of the 
“Agreement”. As the question of territorial jurisdiction has been 

 
Civil Original Suit No.06 of 2023                 
 
 
 
 
 
   2 
 
raised by learned counsel for the Defendant therefore, without 
adverting to other merits of the case, this objection is being decided. It 
is a well-entrenched and settled principle of law that before delving 
into matter in issue, a Court/Tribunal has to make sure that it has 
jurisdiction to ponder upon such issue.  The Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in its judgment reported as “GOVERNMENT OF SINDH 
THROUGH 
SECRETARY 
EDUCATION 
AND 
LITERACY 
DEPARTMENT and others Versus NIZAKAT ALI and others”  
(2011 SCMR 592) has held that “every Court prior to taking 
cognizance and adjudicating upon an issue should first resort to the 
question of assumption of jurisdiction of the Court and if it comes to 
the conclusion that jurisdiction can be assumed only then it can 
adjudicate upon the issue”. The question regarding assumption of 
jurisdiction and its exercise has very comprehensively been dealt with 
and decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case titled 
“FAUJI FOUNDATION and another Versus SHAMIMUR REHMAN”  
(PLD 1983 SC 457). Moreover, it is an oft repeated principle of law 
that jurisdiction cannot be vested to the court with the consent of the 
parties or at their whims unless it is so equipped under the law as held 
by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in “IZHAR ALAM RAROOQI, 
ADVOCATE versus Sheikh ABDUL SATTAR LASI and others”  
(2008 SCMR 240). 
II. 
Agreements relating to Exclusive Jurisdiction Clauses  
5. 
The nub of the matter is to examine the agreements having 
exclusive clauses related to jurisdiction of the Court settled between 
the parties. Learned counsel for the parties, while arguing the case, 
have referred to various documents/agreements executed between the 
parties, filed and relied by them under the provisions of the 
“Ordinance”. Pertinently, signing of the “Agreement” at Karachi and 
inclusion of Clause 12 in it at the time of its execution is not denied. 
Ms. Samia Faiz Durrani, ASC counsel for the Defendant stated that as 
per Clause 12, the parties had agreed that the courts at Karachi would 
have exclusive territorial jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute or 
claim arising out of the agreement  while the Plaintiffs have filed this 
suit before this Court which is liable to be returned under Order VII

Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the “CPC”).  On the 
other hand, Mr. Muhammad Imran Malik, ASC counsel for the 
Plaintiffs have relied on sanction letters of different dates executed at 
Rawalpindi. Before proceeding further, it would be advantageous to 
mention some agreements alongwith their date and place of execution:

proceedings arising out of or in connection with this agreement.  
 
6. 
The admitted documents/agreements tabulated above clearly 
depict that the parties had mutually agreed to resolve their issues at 
Courts of Karachi having exclusive jurisdiction for the determination 
of their disputes. The issue of exclusive jurisdiction for determination 
and enforcement of contractual rights and obligation has been 
discussed by learned Division Bench in “FAYSAL BANK LIMITED 
versus Messrs USMAN ENTERPRISES and another” (2023 CLD 
1563), relevant portion thereof reads as” 
“There are two broad categories under forum 
selection clauses and this categorization is 
depending on the intention of the parties to a 
contract as expressed in the language of the forum 
selection clause. A contract may contain an 
exclusive jurisdiction clause or a non-exclusive 
jurisdiction clause. Traditionally, a clear cut 
distinction could be traced out in common law 
jurisdictions between an exclusive jurisdiction 
clause and a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause. 
Under a traditional exclusive jurisdiction clause the 
parties to a contract agree that disputes arising out 
of the contract will be decided exclusively by the 
court chosen by the parties while under a traditional 
non-exclusive jurisdiction clause parties to a 
contract agree that a particular court or courts will 
be having the jurisdiction to decide a matter 
pertaining to the contract however such a clause 
meant a preferable jurisdiction meaning thereby 
that jurisdiction of other courts was not ousted 
altogether.  
7. In the modern contracts this clear cut traditional 
distinction between an exclusive jurisdiction clause 
and a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause has faded 
away with the passage of time due to multiple 
factors including increasing use and growing 
litigation in relation to such clauses, more 
sophistication in drafting contracts and a variation 
in interpretation of these clauses specially a non-
exclusive jurisdiction clauses by court of different 
jurisdictions. This scenario has led to situations 

 
Civil Original Suit No.06 of 2023                 
 
 
 
 
 
   5 
 
where sometimes a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause 
gives rise to same effects as that of an exclusive 
jurisdiction clause. In such a scenario the 
traditional distinction between these clauses seems 
to be an illusory one. Nevertheless, a distinction can 
be drawn and ascertained on the basis of the content 
and scope of the contractual bargain of the parties 
to a contract. This brings the matter of a non-
exclusive jurisdiction clause in the domain of 
inference from other clauses of such an agreement 
as well as construction of a specific agreement on 
case to case basis by ascertaining the real intent of 
the parties regarding choice of forum”

Diminishing 
Musharakah Financing Agreement, Monthly Payment Agreement, 
Musharakah 
Agreements 
(Purchase 
of 
Asset(s), 
Moveable/Immoveable Property Finance Agreements and Personal 
Guarantees are clear and unambiguously show that the parties had 
given exclusive jurisdiction to the Courts at Karachi, thus, they are 
bound by their terms and condition for resolution of their disputes as 
is evident from para eight (08) of the suit. The Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in “EDEN BUILDERS (PVT.) LIMITED, LAHORE Versus 
MUHAMMAD ASLAM and others” (2022 SCMR 2044) (the “Eden 
Builders case”) has held that the “parties cannot be restrained to 
enforce their right in an ordinary court of law but if by mutual 
agreement between the parties a particular court having territorial  
and pecuniary jurisdiction is selected for the determination of their 
dispute, there appears to be nothing wrong or illegal in it or opposed 
to public policy”. Furthermore, Five (05) Members Bench of Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in “STATE LIFE INSURANCE CORPORATION 
OF PAKISTAN Versus Rana MUHAMMAD SALEEM”  (1987 SCMR 
393) (the “State Life Insurance case”) has held that “there is nothing 
contrary to public policy in an agreement between the parties that the 
disputes between them should be tried at one place rather than the 
other as it would neither contravene provisions laid down in Section 
28 of the Contract Act, 1972 nor violate in any manner provisions of 
Section.9 or Section 20 of C.P.C” . This view was further endorsed by 

 
Civil Original Suit No.06 of 2023                 
 
 
 
 
 
   6 
 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Messrs KADIR MOTORS (REGD). 
RAWALPINDI Versus Messrs NATIONAL MOTORS LTD., KARACHI 
and 3 others” (1992 SCMR 1174) the (“Messrs Kadir Motors case”) 
wherein it has held that “it obviously implies that a party cannot be 
restrained to enforce his right in ordinary Court of law but if by 
mutual agreement between the parties a particular Court having 
territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction is selected for the determination 
of their dispute, there appears to be nothing wrong or illegal in it or 
opposed to public policy”. The above said judgments were referred to 
in 
“AMERICAN 
EXPRESS 
TRAVEL 
RELATED 
SERVICES 
COMPANY INC. and others versus MUHAMMAD NASRULLAH 
BEG, ADVOCATE” (2000 MLD 1155) whereby the Court has held 
that “when parties were at controversy regarding point of jurisdiction 
of Court, it was incumbent upon the Court either to decide question of 
jurisdiction after giving an opportunity of hearing to parties and then 
to proceed with the other issues regarding merits of case”.  
8. 
In view of the admitted exclusive jurisdiction clauses agreed 
between the Parties and in the light of jurisprudence developed by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the “State Life Insurance case” and in 
the “Messrs Kadir Motors case”, it is now a settled and recognized 
law in Pakistan, that all commercial and banking contracts/agreements 
contain a number of “boilerplate clauses”1, which are often seen as 
standard add-ons to the main terms and conditions of the contract. 
One such “boilerplate clause” relates to jurisdiction and choice of 
law, and although these can be relatively straightforward when both 
parties are based in the same jurisdiction, they deserve proper 
consideration, particularly when the parties to the contract are based 
in different jurisdictions.  In drafting dispute resolution clauses in 
commercial 
contracts 
and 
banking 
agreements, 
parties 
contemplate, inter alia, the most convenient and affordable forums to 
resolve their disputes through the “boilerplate clauses”. However, a 
                                                 
1 A boilerplate clause is a legal English term that is used in conjunction with contract law. When forming 
contracts, parties to the contract often use templates or forms with boilerplate clauses (boilerplate language, 
used as standard language). Such clauses refers to the standardized clauses in contracts, and they are to be 
found towards the end of the agreement. Including boilerplate clauses is the process by which parties to the 
contract may better define their relationship and the will to provide certainty if terms in the contract are ever 
disputed. Boilerplate clauses are standard contractual terms that are routinely included in many contracts.

question they are faced with is the extent of autonomy they can 
exercise in choosing an appropriate forum in “boilerplate clauses”. 
Henceforth, to avoid the hassle of litigating in a forum, which is 
inconvenient or time-consuming, parties often mutually agree to 
litigate their disputes before a specific Court.  Such clauses are drafted 
taking into account the common economic and geographic 
convenience of the parties.  As stated earlier, exclusive jurisdiction 
clauses enunciate a choice by parties to limit the place of institution of 
the suit to one forum. Jurisdiction clauses, therefore, relate as to 
which Courts would hear a dispute. Nevertheless, an exclusive 
jurisdiction specifies that only the Courts of a particular jurisdiction, 
such as those of Karachi, in this case, should deal with any disputes 
arising out of a contract between the Parties. 
IV. 
Opinion of the Court  
9. 
Keeping in view of the law laid down in the “State Life 
Insurance case”, the “Messrs Kadir Motors case” and the “Eden 
Builders case” which are binding under Article 189 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, it is 
unequivocal that based on the agreements, mentioned above, 
between the parties, which have been acknowledged by learned 
counsel for the parties and the documents filed and relied by 
learned counsel for the Plaintiffs under Section 9 of the 
“Ordinance” alongwith list of documents under Order XIII Rule 1 
of the “CPC” and under Section 10 of the “Ordinance” by learned 
counsel for the Defendant, this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain 
the matter due to specific and exclusive jurisdiction clauses in all 
the agreements. The view enunciated by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the “State Life Insurance case”, the “Messrs Kadir 
Motors case” and the “Eden Builders Case” was later on followed 
and discussed in “SALEEM MEHTAB versus Messrs REFHAN BEST 
FOOD LTD, COMPNAY through Chief Executive and 9 others” 
(2010 MLD 1015), “Chaudhry MEHTAB AHMAD and another 
versus Mir. SHAKEEL-UR-REHMAN and 4 others” (2004 MLD 
662), “TAHIR TARIQ TEXTILE MILLS (PVT.) LTD. through Chief 
Executive and 2 others versus N.D.F.C. through Chairman”  

 
Civil Original Suit No.06 of 2023

(2001 YLR 846), “TRADESMEN INTERNATIONAL (PVT.) LTD. 
versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary, Ministry of 
Food, Agriculture and Livestock and another” (2008 CLD 1217), 
“BANKERS EQUITY LTD. versus IQAS WEAVING MILLS (PVT.) 
LTD.” (2001 CLD 169).  This Court also in alike matter reported in 
“MCB Bank Limited Versus ADEEL SHAHBAZ STEEL MILLS and 
others” (2023 CLD 655) has returned the plaint of the Bank for its 
presentation before the Court of competent jurisdiction.  
10. 
In the present case, all the agreements, mentioned in 
paragraphs No.3 and 8 were executed on different dates at the 
registered office of the Defendant at Karachi and not disputed by the 
parties. Hence, in the light of case law of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in “State Life Insurance case”, “Messrs Kadir Motors case” 
and the “Eden Builders Case”, this Court lacks territorial jurisdiction 
to pass any judgment and decree against the Defendant. As a sequel, 
the plaint is hereby returned under order VII Rule 10 of the “CPC” 
for presenting it before a Court of Competent Jurisdiction.
