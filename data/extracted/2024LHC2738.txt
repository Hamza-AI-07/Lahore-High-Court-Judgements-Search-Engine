Shahid Karim, J:-. This appeal and a cluster of appeals have 
assailed the judgment by a learned Single Judge of this Court. 
In a set of constitutional petitions the learned Single Judge 
dismissed the challenge to section 4C of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 in its retrospective application to tax year 
2022 and upheld it with regard to inherent discrimination 
which lies in Division IIB of Part I of First Schedule.  Both 
the taxpayers (petitioners before the learned single bench) and 
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) have come in appeals. 
The Scheme of Law: 
2. 
Section 4C was inserted in the Income Tax Ordinance, 
2001 (“the Ordinance”) through Finance Act, 2022 and 
provides that: 
 
4C. Super tax on high earning persons.― (1) A super tax 
shall be imposed for tax year 2022 and onwards at the 
rates specified in Division IIB of Part I of the First 
Schedule, on income of every person: 
 
Provided that this section shall not apply to a 
banking company for tax year 2022. 
(2) For the purposes of this section, “income” shall be the 
sum of the following:— 
i. 
profit on debt, dividend, capital gains, brokerage 
and commission; 
ii. 
taxable income (other than brought forward 
depreciation and brought forward business losses) 
under section 9 of the Ordinance, excluding 
amounts specified in clause (i); 
iii. 
imputable income as defined in clause (28A) of 
section 2 excluding amounts specified in clause (i); 
and 
iv. 
income computed, other than brought forward 
depreciation, brought forward amortization and 
brought forward business losses under Fourth, 
Fifth, Seventh and Eighth Schedules. 
(3) The tax payable under sub-section (1) shall be paid, 
collected and deposited on the date and in the manner as 
specified in sub-section (1) of section 137 and all 
provisions of Chapter X of the Ordinance shall apply. 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
4 
 
(4) Where the tax is not paid by a person liable to pay it, 
the Commissioner shall by an order in writing, determine 
the tax payable, and shall serve upon the person, a notice 
of demand specifying the tax payable and within the time 
specified under section 137 of the Ordinance. 
(5) Where the tax is not paid by a person liable to pay it, 
the Commissioner shall recover the tax payable under sub-
section (1) and the provisions of Part IV, X, XI and XII of 
Chapter X and Part I of Chapter XI of the Ordinance shall, 
so far as may be, apply to the collection of tax as these 
apply to the collection of tax under the Ordinance. 
 (5A) The provisions of section 147 shall apply on tax 
payable under this section. 
(6) The Board may, by notification in the official Gazette, 
make rules for carrying out the purposes of this section. 
3. 
Section 4C imposed a super tax on high-earning 
persons (a term used in the budget speech by Finance 
Minister) and did so for the tax year 2022 and onwards at the 
rates specified under Division IIB of Part I of the First 
Schedule on income of every person (“Division IIB”).  
Division IIB at the relevant time stated the rate of tax under 
Section 4C to be the following: 
S.No  Income under section 4C 
Rate of tax 
(1)  
(2) 
 
 (3)

airlines, automobiles, beverages, cement, chemicals, 
cigarette and tobacco, fertilizer, iron and steel, LNG 
terminal, oil marketing, oil refining, petroleum and gas 
exploration and production, pharmaceuticals, sugar and 
textiles the rate of tax shall be 10% where the income 
exceeds Rs. 300 million: 
Provided further that in case of banking companies for tax 
year 2023, the rate of tax shall be 10% where the income 
exceeds Rs. 300 million. 
4. 
Division IIB was substituted by the Finance Act, 
2023 and now provides that:

5. 
A comparison of the two tables set out above shows that 
initially Division IIB contained five sets of incomes and the 
highest rate of tax was intended to be imposed on persons 
whose income exceeded Rs.300 Million.  There was however a 
proviso inserted originally which prescribed a still higher rate 
of tax on certain category of persons mentioned in the proviso 
(The Proviso).  This was irrespective of whether their income 
exceeded Rs.300 Million yet in respect of persons engaged in 
businesses mentioned in the proviso, the rate of tax had been 
imposed at 10% of their income.  We harbour no doubt that 
section 4C embodies the theory of taxation based on ability to 
pay. 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023

6. 
The petitioners before the learned Single Judge 
challenged the imposition of super tax for the tax year 2022 
which, 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
petitioners, 
operated 
retrospectively and impaired the vested rights of those persons.  
This contention did not find favour with the learned Single 
Judge and the constitutional petitions to this extent were 
dismissed.  The second contention related to discrimination 
inherent in the proviso to isolate a category of persons to 
impose a higher rate of tax simply because their incomes 
exceeded Rs.300 Million.  This challenge was accepted by the 
learned Single Judge who struck down the proviso and 
consequently the higher rate of tax at 10% so that these 
petitioners were also subjected to the rate of tax at 4% of the 
income.  This part of the judgment has been challenged in 
separate set of appeals by the Federal Board of Revenue 
(FBR).  While the persons subjected to tax under Section 4C 
have brought a challenge to the portion of the judgment which 
dismissed the constitutional petitions on the ground of 
retrospectivity and the imposition of section 4C to the tax year 
2022 it is made clear that the appellants do not contend that 
super tax is ultra vires or unconstitutional by its very nature 
but merely intend to seek the indulgence of this Court 
regarding the aspect of retrospectivity and the levy of super tax 
from the tax year 2022. 
Taxpayers’ Appeals: (Appendix A)  
7. 
We shall firstly take up the appeals of the taxpayers 
who are aggrieved of the judgment of the learned Single 
Judge who refused to accept the plea that the vice of 
retrospectivity inhabited in the words “for the tax year 2022 
and 
onwards” 
and 
thus 
rendered 
section 
4C 
as 
unconstitutional.  Appellants’ case can be captured in the 
following contentions: 
Legislature, though having power to enact a law 
retrospectively, cannot do so to upset past and closed 
transactions and accrued rights. 
8. 
To reiterate, section 4C was inserted on 01.07.2022  
through the Finance Act, 2022.  Under the law tax year 2022 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
7 
 
ended on 30th June, 2022.  This is stated in section 74 of the 
Ordinance whose Sub-section (1) provides that: 
“ (1) For the purpose of this Ordinance and subject to this 
section, the tax year shall be a period of twelve months 
ending on the 30th day of June (hereinafter referred to as 
‘normal tax year’) and shall, subject to sub-section (3), be 
denoted by the calendar year in which the said date falls. 
9. 
Thus, the legislature itself has defined the term ‘tax 
year’ to mean a period of twelve months ending on the 30th 
day of June and shall be denoted by the calendar year in which 
the said date falls.  The law envisages a special tax year as 
well which may be allowed by the Commissioner concerned if 
a person applies in writing to allow him to use a 12 months’ 
period other than normal tax year.  Some of the appellants 
(and petitioners before the learned Single Judge) have special 
tax years ending on 30th September 2021 (in the case of sugar 
industry) and 20.12.2021 (in respect of some other categories 
of taxpayers) which is an undisputed fact. 
10. 
The arguments in this Court and the precedents to 
support them will be discussed during the course of this 
opinion and need not be separately stated. 
History of super tax: 
11. 
Ms. Asma Hamid, Advocate for FBR collated an 
executive summary of the brief history of super tax which 
may be set out below in order to lend actuality to the analysis: 
1. 
Tax on income in addition to income tax is 
commonly termed, inter alia, as “super tax”. Amongst the 
earliest enactments that introduced the levy of super tax in 
the Indian sub-continent was the Super Tax Act of 1917. 
Thereafter, the Legislative Council of India enacted the 
Super Tax Act of 1920 which repealed the Super Tax Act of 
1917. It may be noted that till this period, the impost of tax 
in addition to income tax (i.e., super tax) was being made 
through 
separate 
legislative 
enactments 
until 
the 
Legislative council of India, on the recommendations of 
All-Indian Income Tax Committee, consolidated income tax 
and tax in addition to income tax (ie., super tax) in the 
Indian Income Tax Act, 1922. Even though the Income Tax 
Act, 1922 dealt with both income tax and super tax, it still 
maintained the distinction and identities of the two 
categories of taxes, and designated a separate chapter for 
super tax, i.e., chapter IX of the Indian Income Tax Act, 
1922 which contained a distinct charging provision, and 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
8 
 
specified the definition of income and the exemptions 
applicable with respect to the computation of super tax. In 
other words, Chapter IX of the Indian Income Tax Act, 
1922 was a self contained chapter dealing with the charge, 
assessment, collection, and recovery of super tax. It is also 
worth noting that even though the Indian Income Tax Act 
1922 defined super tax as tax in addition to income tax, it 
did not include the same within income tax; the legislature, 
in its wisdom, clearly kept the separate identity of super tax 
maintained.  
2. 
After its independence, the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan adopted, as is, the Income Tax Act of 1922 as its 
code on direct taxation. However, from time to time, 
through parliamentary enactments and Ordinances, the 
charges levied, definitions, and computation and recovery 
methods were amended. Thereafter, the Income Tax Act of 
1992 was repealed by the Income Tax Ordinance 1979 
which, with respect to the levy of super tax, adopted a 
similar scheme and maintained the super tax’s distinct and 
self contained identity. Thereafter, the promulgation of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 repealed the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 1979. Super Tax was reintroduced in the 2001 
Ordinance through the Finance Act, 2015, by adding 
section 4B (super tax for rehabilitation of Temporarily 
Displaced Persons) that imposed a super tax on certain 
persons with retroactive effect on tax year 2015. It is 
important to note that in March 2011, a surcharge of 
income tax was initially added by section 4A through the 
Income 
Tax 
(Amendment) 
Ordinance 
2011 
dated 
16.03.2011 and then 30.05.2011 and finally omitted by 
Finance Act 2014. It was a tax that was an additional 
charge/amount in addition to the due income tax that 
increased the amount of income tax, however, it was not a 
distinct category of tax in the same nature as, super tax. It 
may be noted, however, that although the nomenclature is 
different, a surcharge or surtax has in common with super 
tax, the quality of being in addition to a charge of normal 
tax/increasing the amount of tax liability. It is pertinent to 
note the levy of surcharge by section 4A was challenged by 
petitioner who was a special tax year taxpayer on the 
ground that as its tax year 2011 had ended prior to the 
passing of the Ordinance through which the surcharge was 
levied, therefore it was not liable to pay. The Hon’ble Sindh 
High Court dismissed the petition, holding that a special 
tax year use did not in any way, entitle a taxpayer allowed 
to use the same, to evade tax; the judgment was assailed in 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court where it remained intact, hence 
attained finality. 
3. 
It must be noted that section 4B of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 was subjected to many constitutional 
challenges before the Hon’ble High Courts of Sindh, 
Lahore and Islamabad; however, the constitutional courts 
of Pakistan unanimously upheld its vires and the appeal 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
9 
 
preferred by the appellants against the said decision is 
currently pending before the Hon’ble Supreme Court which 
granted leave to appeal to the appellants subject to the 
payment of 50% deposit of the super tax due under section 
4B of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. 
4. 
In the recent past, through the Finance Act of 2022, 
the Parliament inserted, inter alia, section 4C (Super Tax 
on High Earning Persons) in the Income Ordinance 2001 
which imposed a super tax on certain high earning persons 
with retroactive effect for the tax year 2022 and onwards; 
except for the banking companies which were liable to pay 
super tax from the tax year 2023.  
12. 
We may point out that section 4B is still part of the 
law and has not been repealed by the insertion of section 4C.  
The significance of this aspect will be adverted to in the later 
part of this opinion. 
13. 
As adumbrated, the appellants submit that a right had 
come to vest in the appellants/ taxpayers with the close of tax 
year on 30th June, 2022 and any imposition of a tax could not 
be made to apply retrospectively.  Section 4C in its current 
form abridges and impairs the vested rights acquired under 
existing law and creates a new obligation in respect of 
transactions or considerations already past and closed.  This 
argument is based on precedents of the superior courts which 
have vouched this rule successively over the years.  
Reference may be made to Mehreen Zebun Nisa v. Land 
Commissioner Multan (PLD 1975 S.C 397).  There is not 
much sunlight between the appellants and FBR regarding 
settled rule of interpretation of statutes which holds that 
vested rights can indeed be taken away by express words and 
legislation cannot be struck down merely because it does so.  
Legislature is competent to give retrospective effect to an Act 
and thereby take away vested rights of parties.  Muhammad 
Hussain v. Muhammad and others (2000 SCMR 367) and 
several other judgments (which may not be discussed in 
detail) may be cited to bring home this rule of interpretation.   
14. 
Learned counsel for the appellants referred to the well-
worn concept of three stages in the imposition of a tax: There 
is the declaration of liability, the assessment and lastly comes 
the methods of recovery if the person taxed does not 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
10 
 
voluntarily pay.  These stages have, over time, been restated 
in the judgments of the superior courts and were relied upon 
in H.M Extraction Ghee & Oil Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. v. FBR 
(2019 SCMR 1081).  This concept has been used by the 
counsel for the appellants to argue that liability crystallized 
on 30th June, 2022 in respect of the appellants to pay tax as 
per the statute and what remained merely was the assessment 
part which does not depend on the liability which had already 
been fixed by 30th June 2022.  This is the sum of the 
arguments of the appellants. 
Retrospectivity of laws-general concepts: 
15. 
Two treatises will be relied upon to articulate the rule 
of construction of revenue laws and retrospective taxation.  In 
A Treatise on the Law of Taxation by Thomas M. Cooley 
(second edition) a brilliant exposition and methodical 
discussion on the principles of taxation, it has been stated 
that: 
“…We are therefore at liberty to suppose that the two main 
objects had in view in framing the provisions of any tax 
law were, first, the providing a public revenue, and second, 
the securing of individuals against extortion and plunder 
under cover of the proceedings to collect the revenue…”  
“The question regarding the revenue laws has generally 
been whether or not they should be construed strictly. To 
express it in somewhat different language, the question is 
whether, when a question of doubt arises in the application 
of a statute to its subject matter or supposed subject matter, 
the doubt is not to be solved in favour of the citizen, rather 
than in favour of the state upon whose legislation the doubt 
arises, and whether such solution is not most in accord 
with the general principles applied in other cases. Strict 
construction is the general rules in the case of statutes 
which may divest one of his freehold by proceedings not in 
the ordinary sense judicial, and to which he is only an 
enforced party. It is thought to be only reasonable to intend 
that the legislature, in making provision for such 
proceedings, would take unusual care to make use of terms 
which would plainly express its meaning, in order that 
ministerial officers might not be left in doubt in the exercise 
of unusual powers, and that the citizen might know exactly 
what were his duties and liabilities. A strict construction in 
such cases seems reasonable, because presumptively the 
legislatures has given in plain terms all the power it has 
intended should be exercised. It has been very generally 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
11 
 
supposed that the like strict construction was reasonable in 
the case of tax laws.” 
“Statutes,” says a learned and able writer, “made for the 
advancement of trade and commerce, and to regulate the 
conduct of merchants, ought to be perfectly clear and 
intelligible to person of their description. By the use of 
ambiguous clauses in laws of that sort, the legislature 
would be laying a snare for the subject, and a 
construction which conveys such an imputation ought 
never to be adopted. Judges, therefore, where clauses are 
obscure, will lean against forfeitures, leaving it to the 
legislature to correct the evil, if there be any…” 
“The same author on another page says: “It is a well 
settled rule of law that every charge upon the subject must 
be imposed by clear and unambiguous language. Acts of 
parliament which impose a duty upon the public will be 
critically construed with reference to the particular 
language in which they are expressed. When there is any 
ambiguity found, the construction must be in favour of 
public; because it is a general rule that when the public 
are to be charged with a burden, the intention of the 
legislature to impose that burden must be explicitly and 
distinctly shown.” 
“In every case, therefore, of doubt, such statutes are 
construed most strongly against the government, and in 
favour of the subjects or citizens, because burdens are not 
to be imposed, nor presumed to be imposed, beyond what 
the statutes expressly and clearly import.” 
16. 
Firstly, the rule has been stated regarding framing of 
provisions of any tax law to provide a public revenue but at 
the same time to secure the individuals against extortion and 
plunder under cover of the procedures to collect the revenue.  
The treatise delved into the question whether revenue laws 
are to be construed strictly or not.  It goes on to state the 
general rule regarding the need for statutes being clear and 
intelligible to persons of their description and in particular 
statutes made for the advancement of trade and commerce 
which is the case in the instant matters.  It reiterates the rule 
that in case of doubt courts must lean in favour of the subject 
or citizens.  Learned counsel for the appellants contend that 
section 4C does not charge a burden on the tax year 2022 as 
this intention cannot be discerned clearly and explicitly from 
the language of section 4C.

On the subject of retrospective taxation, Thomas M. 
Cooley states the rule in the following terms: (p.p 291-293) 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
12 
 
“Retrospective taxation. The basis of an apportionment of 
taxes may as lawfully be retrospective as the reverse; that 
is to say, it may as well have regard to benefits theretofore 
received as to those which may be received thereafter. It 
has therefore been very properly held that there is no 
constitutional or other legal objection to the levy of taxes to 
pay for municipal improvements which had been previously 
made. Nor in apportioning the tax as between individuals 
is there any valid objection to making it on consideration 
of a state of things that may now have come to an end; as 
where a tax is imposed on the extent of one’s business for 
the preceding year, instead of upon an estimate of 
business for the year to come. Where taxes are levied for a 
series of years upon the same valuation of property, they 
are 
necessarily 
retrospectives, 
but 
not 
therefore 
incompetent, though one may be taxed upon property which 
he has long ceased to own when the tax is levied. But there 
is commonly a presumption that any new tax law was not 
intended to reach back and take for its standard of 
apportionment a state of things that may no longer be in 
existence. “New burdens,” it is very justly said, “ought 
always to be prospective,” and it is reasonable to suppose 
the legislature has intended that they should be. Such a 
supposition is in harmony with the general rule of law 
which requires the courts to “always construe statutes as 
prospective and not retrospective, unless constrained to 
the contrary course by the rigor of the phraseology.” This 
is the rule not only as a construction of the grant of 
power, but also as to all the incidents; though remedial 
provision may well be presumed to have been intended to 
reach back for the purposes of justice. And in cases where 
a tax is levied to meet expenses previously incurred, or to 
pay the cost of something of which the persons to be taxed 
have already had the benefit, any presumption against an 
intent to give the law retroactive operation may be 
overcome by the apparent justice of such a construction.“ 
18. 
The crux of the statement set out above is that there is 
a presumption that any new tax law was not intended to reach 
back and take for its standard of apportionment a state of 
things that may no longer be in existence and that new 
burdens ought always to be prospective.  Cooley relied upon 
the general rule of law which requires the courts to always 
construe statutes as prospective and not retrospective unless 
constrained to the contrary by the phraseology used. 
Elsewhere, Cooley recognised that: 
“Retrospective legislation, except when designed to cure 
formal defects, or otherwise operate remedially, is 
commonly objectionable in principle, and apt to result in 
injustice; and it is a sound rule of construction which 
refuses lightly to imply an intent to enact it.”

(Thomas M. Cooley, A treatise on the constitutional 
limitations which Rest upon the Legislative Power of 
the States of the American Union 62-63). 
19. 
Closely tied in with the above exposition, the second 
treatise, Bennion, Bailey and Norbury on Statutory 
Interpretation, Eighth Edition reweighs the subject in the 
section relating to retrospectivity (at pages 264 to 276). 
20. 
Firstly, Bennion refers to the principle of legal policy 
that “except in relation to procedural matters, changes in 
the law should not take effect retrospectively”.  Further the 
term ‘retrospectivity’ has been defined as “legislation is 
retrospective if it alters the legal consequences of things 
that happened before it came into force”. 
21. 
Bennion too relies upon the general presumption 
against retrospectivity and the approach of the courts when 
determining whether legislation is intended to have 
retrospective effect.  Underpinning the approach is a wider 
principle of legal policy that law should not operate 
retrospectively.  
“The essential idea of a legal system is that current law 
should govern current activities. If we do something today, 
we feel that the law applying to it should be the law in force 
today, not tomorrow’s backward adjustment of it. We 
believe that the nature of law is such that ‘…. Those who 
have arranged their affairs … in reliance on a decision 
which has stood for many years should not find that their 
plans have been retrospectively upset.” 
22. 
The above statement provides the underlying rationale 
for the presumption against retrospectivity.  All taxpayers in 
the present context doing something today would legitimately 
expect that law applying to them should be the law enforced 
today not tomorrow’s backward adjustment of it.  That is how 
ordinary persons arrange their affairs.  Bennion alluded to the 
maxim lex prospicit non respicit: 
“The principle is sometimes expressed in the maxim lex 
prospicit non respicit law looks forward not back. As Willes 
J said in Phillips v Eyre retrospective legislation is 
contrary to the general principle that legislation by which 
the conduct of mankind is to be regulated ought, when 
introduced for the first time, to deal with future acts, and 
ought not to change the character of past transactions 
carried on upon the faith of the then existing law.” 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
14 
 
23. 
Despite the general principle, Bennion recognized that 
Parliament does have the power to produce a retrospective 
effect.  It is further stated in the ‘Treatise’ that: 
“A distinction is sometimes drawn between changes to the 
law in relation to events which have already taken place 
and changes to the law which alter existing rights or 
obligations or other matters but only in relation to the 
future. It is the latter class that throws up the most 
difficulties, which is only to be expected: since it is less 
surprising that Parliament should want to change the law 
for the future in relation to existing rights and obligations 
the question of construction is more finely balanced.  
24. 
The reference to legislation to reverse an unexpected 
decision by the courts can be used to justify the insertion of 
section 31 A to the Customs Act, 1969 and which was the 
subject matter of a decision by the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
which we will discuss shortly. 
25. 
In the ‘Treatise’ by Bennion, a crucial aspect of 
retrospectivity and the best way it has to be viewed merits 
recitation.  It is stated that retrospectivity is better viewed as a 
question of degree which will vary according to the context 
and that the degree of retrospectivity is one of the relevant 
factors when considering whether the general principle 
against retrospectivity is rebutted.  The courts in the United 
Kingdom have looked at this question from the aspect of 
fairness and the interaction of several factors to determine the 
degree to which the statute has retrospective effect. The 
question of degree and element of fairness are now added to 
the traditional interpretative toolkit of the courts to 
circumscribe 
the 
power 
of 
Parliament 
to 
legislate 
retrospectively. 
26. 
Lastly, the presumption against retrospectivity has 
been treated in the following manner in Reading Law: The 
Interpretation of Legal Texts by Antonin Scalia and Bryan A. 
Garner– 
“As a general, almost invariable rule, a legislature makes 
law for the future, not for the past. Judicial opinions 
typically pronounce what the law was at the time of a 
particular happening. Statutes, by contrast, typically 
pronounce what the law becomes when the statutes take 
effect. This point is basic to our rule of law. Even when they 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
15 
 
do not say so (and they rarely do), statutes will not be 
interpreted to apply to past events.” 
“The presumption against retroactivity is a guide to 
interpretation, not a constitutional imperative, because the 
presumption applies even when the Constitution does not 
forbid retroactivity.” 
Al-Samrez and Molasses Trading: 
27. 
The appellants anchored their arguments on two 
judgments of the Supreme Court of Pakistan to contend that 
in such matters retrospectivity cannot affect rights which have 
already accrued and so the appellants fall outside the charge 
to tax. The courts, according to the learned counsel for the 
appellants, have discountenanced the application of taxing 
statutes so as to upend past and closed transactions.  It is 
necessary to indulge in a deeper analysis of these two 
judgments in order to apply them to the facts of the present 
cases. The cardinal feature of these cases is to define the 
contours of retrospective legislation.  
28. 
The arguments of the appellants in this Court centred 
on Al-Samrez Enterprise v. Federation of Pakistan (1986 
SCMR 1917) (Al-Samrez) and Molasses Trading & Export 
(Pvt.) Limited v. Federation of Pakistan & others (1993 
SCMR 1905) (Molasses Trading). The basic strands of these 
judgments require unpacking.  
29. 
Al-Samrez was a case which related to an exemption in 
customs duty through a notification and changes in the rate of 
duties by a second notification and the question arose whether 
the second notification would have retrospective operation so 
as to impair vested rights.  Thus, an executive action was 
brought under challenge although the Supreme Court held that 
such a power being statutory the second notification had the 
force of statutory instrument and proceeded to hold that rules 
of statutory construction were attracted to the interpretation 
and determination of its legal effect.  It was on this basis that 
the Supreme Court held that the rule against retrospection 
would apply to an executive action as well and could not 
prejudicially affect vested rights or legality of past 
transactions.  The issue before the Supreme Court was 
summarized in the following words: 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
16 
 
“…and then comes the most relevant clause which 
comprises the second component included in the rate of 
duty, which reads as follows: "and the amount of duty that 
may have become payable in consequence of the 
withdrawal of the whole or any part of the exemption or 
concession from duty whether before or after the 
conclusion of a contract or agreement for the sale of such 
goods or opening of a letter of credit in respect thereof." In 
order to bring out the true import and the meaning of this 
part of the section Supreme Court arranged the various 
phrases thereof and added a few words thereto placed in 
the brackets the text of which would then read as follows:-- 
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any 
other law for the time being in force or any 
decision of any Court, for the purposes of 
sections 30 and 31, the rate of duty applicable 
to any goods shall include ...the amount that 
may have become payable in consequence of 
withdrawal of exemption from duty, whether 
(the withdrawal is) before or after the 
conclusion of a contract or agreement for the 
sale of such goods or opening of a letter of 
credit thereof. 
A plain reading of this text would show that by a mandate 
of law the rate of duty, which was a matter pertaining to 
the taxability or leviability of the duty, has now to include 
the amount not only of the duty imposed under section 18, 
but also the amount that would notionally become payable 
if the exemption is withdrawn, irrespective of whether the 
withdrawal takes place before or after the conclusion of a 
contract for the sale of goods or opening of a letter of 
credit. It is easy now to see that the distinction between 
chargeability and playability of a duty under the Act has 
been effectively destroyed because the rate would now 
include the quantified amount of duty that would be 
payable as a result of withdrawal of exemption from duty. 
The direction that, this will be the position whether the 
withdrawal is before or after the conclusion of a contract 
or opening of a letter of credit, has the effect of destroying 
the doctrine of vested rights on the basis of which the 
decision in the case of Al-Samrez Enterprise was given. In 
ordinary concept the rate does not include the quantum or 
the total amount payable, but the legislature has mandated 
that it shall be included within the rate of duty by the fiction 
created in law. Therefore contention that the position has 
remained unchanged in spite of section 31-A, because its 
provisions have been confined to operate only for the 
purpose of sections 30 and 31, is not tenable, because 
under the changed law section 30 now not only deals with 
rate of duty, but the amount payable under section 18 of the 
Act as well as in consequence of withdrawal of exemption, 
destroying the vested rights that may have accrued on 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
17 
 
account of the conclusion of contract for the sale of goods 
or opening of a letter of credit” 
30. 
After referring to the law applicable to the facts of the 
case and the nature of exemption granted by law the Supreme 
Court held that mere grant of exemption under Section 19 of 
the Customs Act, 1969 did not have the effect of modifying or 
altering the levy of duty under Section 18 which continues to 
be in force.  The rule was stated that the liability for payment 
of duty which accrued under Section 18 was temporarily 
wiped off to the extent of duties which were exempted.  
Thereafter the Supreme Court alluded to the question as to 
whether in the circumstances of the case the appellants had 
acquired vested rights to the exemption in terms of the earlier 
notification or contrarily they were legally deprived of the 
same on the basis of second revised notification.  The point of 
reference with regard to a vested right having come to accrue 
in a person was taken to be a binding contract concluded 
between the appellants and the foreign exporter or if steps 
were taken which created a vested right to the existing 
notification granting exemption.  If these acts done by an 
exporter were performed in the opinion of the Supreme Court 
a right had come to vest which could not be taken away and 
destroyed in modification of the earlier notification.  The 
Supreme Court did not hold the second notification to be ultra 
vires the powers of Government but merely stated the rule that 
it did not apply retrospectively to upset vested rights.   
31. 
Al-Samrez, in our opinion, is not squarely relevant to 
the cases in hand as the said precedent merely lays a general 
rule regarding application of a statutory notification by 
executive on past transactions and concluded contracts.  It 
alluded to the rule regarding retrospectivity and its interplay 
with vested rights.  In Al-Samrez the court was not analysing a 
statute which specifically operated retrospectively by its letter 
and the intention of the legislature was clear in this regard.  
Therefore, as a policy of law it was held that such actions 
cannot be permitted to operate retrospectively.  In the instant 
cases on the other hand section 4C incorporates a clear 
intention on the part of the legislature for it to operate 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
18 
 
retrospectively and, therefore, the issues on these appeals are 
more nuanced and requires this Court to enter into discourse as 
to whether under such circumstances the Courts will frown 
upon such legislative intent and hold that despite clear 
intentions the retrospectivity would still not affect the past 
transactions of the appellants which have come to a close. 
32. 
This brings us to Molasses Trading which is a case 
more in point.  Molasses Trading considered the effect of 
section 31A inserted in the 1969 Act by the legislature to 
nullify the effect in Al-Samrez.  The facts in Molasses Trading 
had uncanny similarity to the facts in Al-Samrez.  Yet by that 
time the legislature had inserted section 31A and it fell to the 
Supreme Court to determine the effect of the insertion of 
section 31A and the clear intent of the legislature to apply it 
retrospectively to concluded contracts and past events.  The 
difference between Al-Samrez and Molasses Trading therefore 
is that in Molasses Trading the effect of a retrospective statute 
was under consideration and so the Supreme Court was 
engaged to resolve the issue whether in such circumstances as 
well the doctrine of vested rights propounded in Al-Samrez 
would still apply.  The legislature made its intention clear by 
the use of following words in section 31A: 
“and the amount of duty that may have become payable in 
consequence of the withdrawal of the whole or any part of 
the exemption or concession from duty whether before or 
after the conclusion of a contract or agreement for sale of 
such goods or opening of a letter of credit in respect 
thereof”.   
33. 
The words set out above were interpreted by the 
Supreme Court while issuing its holding in Molasses Trading.  
The Supreme Court accepted that section 31A nullified the 
effect of Al-Samrez as also that it had the effect of destroying 
the doctrine of vested rights given in Al-Samrez.  This 
observation may seem a contradiction in terms while analysing 
the later part of the judgment and the conclusion drawn at the 
end of it.  For, in our opinion, the Supreme Court resurrected 
the doctrine of vested rights yet did so in a different manner.  
The real issue then was framed by the Supreme Court as 
follows: 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
19 
 
“The only other question that remains to be considered is, 
that notwithstanding the altered position produced by 
section 31-A depriving an importer of the right to be 
protected against any change in the quantum of exemption, 
on the basis or which he has entered into a contract for the 
sale of goods to be imported and opened a letter of credit 
or performed other acts, to what extent this section can be 
given retrospective effect and whether such retrospective 
effect can be given so as to affect past and closed 
transactions.” 
“…a statute cannot be read in such a way as to change 
accrued rights, the title to which consists in transactions 
past and closed or any facts or events that have already 
occurred...” 
34. 
It is evident from the observation set out above that the 
Supreme Court, having conceded that section 31A was to be 
given retrospective effect, proceeded to consider whether this 
can be done so as to affect past and closed transactions.  
The Supreme Court reiterated the principle that “a statute 
cannot be read in such a way as to change accrued rights the 
title to which consists in transactions past and closed or any 
facts or events that had already occurred”.  These observations 
in our opinion underline the concept of impermissible law-
making and constitute a departure from the limited doctrine of 
vested rights which was settled in Al-Samrez and the Supreme 
Court embarked upon a broader issue relating to statutes and 
their effect on accrued rights, the title to which consists in 
transactions past and closed or any facts or events that have 
already occurred.  Accordingly, this in the opinion of the 
Supreme Court comprised another species of rights which 
even a retrospective statute could not take away and regarding 
which the legislature had to adopt a different modus operandi 
which would include inter alia a clear enunciation of the 
intention in this regard.  This aspect will be elaborated further 
while considering the effect of Molasses Trading.  In a nub, 
the Supreme Court on the basis of rules settled by precedents 
inter alia Mehreen Zebun Nisa considered the question of a 
statute affecting transactions which had become past and 
events which had already occurred.  This was different from 
concluded contracts and the assertion of vested rights on that 
basis.  The Supreme Court referred to the settled principle that 
while enacting retrospective legislation the legislature creates 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
20 
 
a fiction and imagines state of affairs which do not exist.  
However, there are inevitable corollaries of that state of affairs 
which will be subjected to the rules of construction by the 
Courts.  It is, therefore, the duty of the Court to determine the 
limits within which the legislature has created a fiction.  It was 
stated that: 
“It cannot straightway be held that the mere fact that 
section 31A has been given retrospective effect, it will affect 
even the past and closed transactions or all the vested rights 
that have accrued.” 
35. 
Then comes the crucial point where the Supreme Court 
dealt with the aspect of what comprises past and closed 
transactions under the circumstances and for the purpose relied 
upon the concept of presentation of a bill of entry under 
section 30 of the 1969 Act and it was held that at this point 
“the levy of duty was crystallized”.  It was observed that 
“therefore this is the crucial point of time at which, by 
operation of law the liability is discharged.  In other words the 
rights and liabilities of the importers attained fixity on the 
said crucial date….the mere fact that any proceeding 
remained pending for assessment of the tax by a statutory 
functionary for the purpose of recovery of the dues will not 
prevent the law from operating and producing the result by 
closing the transaction”.   Further the Supreme Court held that: 
“…Viewed in this perspective, if effect is given to the 
provisions of section 31-A so as to undo the discharge of 
the liability which had already taken effect, it will amount 
to re-opening a past and closed transaction. The simple 
reason is that under the existing law there was no further 
liability to pay the tax and by giving retrospective 
operation to the new dispensation a liability is being 
created for the payment of the tax. I cannot see anything in 
the language of section 31-A, expressly or by necessary 
intendment, to that effect. Such result is therefore not a 
necessary corollary of the fiction created by the deeming 
provisions of section 5 of the Finance Act, 1988. Otherwise 
also it will be contrary' of the principle, mentioned above, 
namely, that liabilities once fixed or rights created by 
operation of law upon facts or events, must not be 
disturbed by a general provision given retrospective effect 
unless such intention is clearly manifested by the language 
employed. In the case of Mehreen Zebun Nisa (supra) 
retrospective effect was not given to the changed law so as 
to invalidate certain acts of legislature, although the entry 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
21 
 
in the relevant legislative list had been changed with 
retrospective effect. 
36. 
Thus, the Supreme Court was of the view that section 
31A could not operate to undo the liability which had already 
taken effect as this will amount to reopening a past and closed 
transaction.  Further that liabilities once fixed or rights created 
by operation of law upon facts or events which have already 
taken place cannot be disturbed by a general provision giving 
retrospective effect unless such intention is clearly 
manifested by the language employed”.  The distinction that 
was drawn by the Supreme Court in Molasses Trading so as to 
disapply retrospective statutory law to past transactions which 
have come to a close is that it would not be sufficient for the 
legislature to give a general retrospective operation and intend 
thereby to upend past and closed transactions.  This cannot be 
taken as a necessary corollary of the fiction created by a 
deeming provision.  Since these rights are created by 
operation of law the liabilities have become definite and 
rights have been created upon facts or events which have come 
to pass.  They cannot be disturbed by a general provision 
giving retrospective effect.  The language employed must 
clearly show that changed law seeks to invalidate certain acts 
taken under the law and which have become past and closed.  
The distilled essence of Molasses Trading is that there must be 
a crucial date on which the liability to pay tax crystallized and 
there is no further liability to pay and it does not matter 
whether an assessment of the recovery is yet to take place.  In 
the case of section 31A which was inserted on 01.07.1988, the 
date of filing of bill of entry was taken as that crucial date on 
which the liability to pay tax crystallized in the case of 
importers. 
37. 
Applying the same reasoning to the facts of the present 
appeals the crystallized date would be 30th June, 2022 when 
the tax year ended for all of the appellants and the liability to 
pay tax became definite for these appellants.  Applying the 
ratio decidendi of Molasses Trading to section 4C the words 
“a super tax shall be imposed for tax year 2022 and onwards” 
manifest a general provision which gives retrospective effect 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
22 
 
and ensnares tax year 2022 in the imposition as well.  It does 
not clearly state that this is notwithstanding past and closed 
transactions and concluded rights or irrespective whether the 
liability had crystallized as on 30th June 2022.  In the absence 
of such clear intention on the part of the legislature section 4C 
cannot be applied to disturb and upend liabilities which have 
been fixed and rights created by operation of law.  By 
operation of law is meant the various provisions of the 
Ordinance which not only prescribe the period of a tax year 
but also required the taxpayers to manage their affairs for a tax 
year in a certain manner and the guiding polestar for the 
taxpayers to arrange those affairs was that their taxable income 
would be fixed and crystallized on 30th June 2022 and on the 
basis of which they were required to file their returns.   
38. 
Thus, Molasses Trading formulated the doctrine of 
vested rights in a mutated form, given the promulgation of 
section 31A but in actual fact reiterated it.  It held that section 
31A did not affect past and closed transactions instead of 
vested rights previously espoused in Al-Samrez.   In essence, 
this was because of the use of the words “whether before or 
after the conclusion of a contract or agreement for sale of such 
goods or opening of a letter of credit” in section 31A.  Truly, 
the Supreme Court in Molasses Trading viewed section 31A in 
the same mould as the impugned notification in Al-Samrez yet 
eked a right out of the straightjacket of section 31A to inhere 
in the importers.  In Al-Samrez concluded contracts were made 
the signpost while in Molasses Trading the bills of entry and 
their presentation was considered as the crucial date to hold 
that it became past transaction and these remained unaffected 
by section 31A.  That is why the Supreme Court alluded to 
certain concepts of rights created by operation of law which 
cannot be impaired or taken away by a general provision 
giving retrospective effect.  The intention must be clearly 
manifest by the language employed viz. that rights acquired 
under past transaction are being taken away, too.  This is the 
test that will guide us. 
Tax as Public Law; Fairness: 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
23 
 
39. 
In the United Kingdom the rule against retrospective 
application of legislative provisions is grounded on a different 
set of reasoning.  The courts have invoked the concept of 
fairness from the public law to ascertain the degree of 
retrospectivity as a relevant factor.  The principles to be 
applied in determining whether legislation is retrospective was 
considered by the House of Lords.  Having cautioned against 
undue or mechanistic reliance of generalized presumptions, the 
U.K House of Lords applied the following statement from 
Secretary of State for Social Security v Tunnicliff [1991] 2 All 
ER 712: 
“In my judgment the true principle is that Parliament is 
presumed not to have intended to alter the law applicable to 
past events and transactions in a manner which is unfair to 
those concerned in them unless a contrary intention 
appears.  It is not simply a question of classifying an 
enactment as retrospective or not retrospective.  Rather it 
may well be a matter of degree – the greater the unfairness, 
the more it is to be expected that Parliament will make it 
clear if that is intended.” 
40. 
Thus, the rule was clearly laid down that it was not 
simply a question of classifying an enactment as retrospective 
or not retrospective rather it is a matter of degree, that is, the 
greater the unfairness the more it is to be expected that 
Parliament will make it clear if that is intended.  This is the 
result which was achieved in Molasses Trading by applying 
different reasoning but in our opinion that too was based on 
the concept of fairness in classifying an enactment as 
retrospective or not retrospective.  The House of Lords [1994] 
1 AC 486, then went on to address the question of how the 
courts approached the question of what fairness demands: 
“Precisely how the single question of fairness will be 
answered in respect of a particular statute will depend on 
the interaction of several factors, each of them capable of 
varying from case to case.  Thus, the degree to which the 
statute has retrospective effect is not a constant.  Nor is the 
value of the rights which the statute affects, or the extent to 
which that value is diminished or extinguished by the 
retrospective effect of the statute.  Again, the unfairness of 
adversely affecting the rights and hence the degree of 
unlikelihood that this is what Parliament intended, will 
vary from case to case.  So also will the clarity of the 
language and by Parliament, and the light shed on it by 
consideration of the circumstances in which the legislation 
was enacted.  All these factors must be weighed together to 
provide a direct answer to the question whether the 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
24 
 
consequences of reading the statute with the suggested 
degree of retrospectivity are so unfair that the words used 
by Parliament cannot have been intended to mean what they 
might appear to say.” 
41. 
Factors relevant to reaching the decision in the House 
of Lords included the value and nature of the rights affected, 
the purpose of legislation and the hardship of the result.  The 
emphasis in the statement set out above by the United 
Kingdom House of Lords was the degree of unfairness of 
adversely affecting the rights and the clarity of the language 
used by the Parliament and hence the degree of unlikelihood 
that this is what Parliament intended. 
42. 
We have rarely seen the application of administrative 
law doctrines to tax problems.  Yet both Al-Samrez and 
Molasses Trading represent case-law on taxpayers’ legitimate 
expectations and the application of underlying public law 
principles such as rule of law to taxation.  One of the leading 
textbook in the field of Tax as Public Law (J. Tiley and G. 
Loutzenhisey, Revenue Law, 7th ed, Oxford 2012) claims that: 
“Although the power to tax has been at the very centre of 
some of our major constitutional law disputes, including the 
execution of a King, there is a lack of engagement with 
public law issues.” 
Constitutional rule: 
43. 
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes (U.S Supreme Court) 
famously said that “taxes are what we pay for civilised 
society.”  (Compania General de Filipinas v Collector of 
Internal Revenue (1927) 275 US 87, 100). Although the rule 
enunciated in Molasses Trading was based on a general 
principle of legal policy to establish a presumption against 
retrospectivity yet in our opinion the rule rests on a higher 
constitutional principle.  We can look to its source in the 
Constitution apart from its basis in general rules of public 
policy.  If the courts concede power to the legislature to enact 
such and such laws which are retrospective in operation yet 
fence that power at the same time then it must be done by 
looking at the fundamental law.  The reason for this is not hard 
to divine.  We live in a constitutional democracy and the 
fundamental source of all laws is the Constitution.  There are a 
number of provisions in the Constitution which illuminate the 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
25 
 
meaning of the rule and provide sufficient justification for the 
rule to be applied by the courts.  Article 4 of the Constitution 
provides that: 
4. (1) To enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in 
accordance with law is the inalienable right of every citizen. 
Wherever he may be, and of every other person for the time 
being within Pakistan.  
2) In particular—  
(a) no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation 
or property of any person shall be taken except in 
accordance with law;  
(b) no person shall be prevented from or be hindered in 
doing that which is not prohibited by law; and 
(c) no person shall be compelled to do that which the law 
does not required him to do. “…” 
 
Article 23 relates to the provision as to property and 
provides that: 
23. Every citizen shall have the right to acquire, hold and 
dispose of property in any part of Pakistan, subject to the 
Constitution and any reasonable restrictions imposed by law 
in the public interest. 
Similarly, Article 24(1) states that: 
24. (1) No person shall be deprived of his property save in 
accordance with law. 
44. 
Article 4 as set out above relates to the rights of 
individuals to be dealt with in accordance with law and makes 
it an unalienable right of every citizens to enjoy the protection 
of law.  In particular, it enjoins that no action detrimental to 
inter alia life and property of any person shall be taken 
except in accordance with law.  Thus, Article 4 raises the bar 
of protection afforded to all citizens and persons to a 
constitutional pedestal.  The total income earned by a taxpayer 
/ appellants is the property of these taxpayers and cannot be 
taken away except in accordance with law.  Since the 
Constitution provided this protection, therefore, it is legitimate 
to accept that the legislature will not make any law which 
would take away the property of a person and thus cause the 
abridgment of the fundamental right conferred upon that 
person.  Similarly, Article 23 mandates that every citizen shall 
have the right to acquire and hold property which is only 
subject to the Constitution and any reasonable restrictions 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
26 
 
imposed by law.  Once again, the term ‘reasonable restriction’ 
would not include restrictions in the nature of retrospective 
laws which take away rights which have accrued to a person 
and in respect of actions which are past and closed.  The law 
prescribing such a taking should be unambiguous and must by 
its words clearly state that it is intended to affect past and 
closed transactions without a manner of doubt.   
45. 
To the same effect is the right enshrined in Article 
24(1) which states that no person shall be deprived of his 
property save in accordance with law.  Section 4C in applying 
the impost to tax year 2022 doubtless, deprives the appellants 
of the use of their property in the form of income under all 
heads of income for the tax year.  Thus, the rule laid down in 
Molasses Trading has a constitutional basis and flows from the 
Constitution and must, therefore, be viewed as a right which 
fundamentally inheres in the appellants.  Since in the United 
Kingdom there is no written constitution yet the courts have 
evolved a rule based on fairness to protect the rights of persons 
affected by retrospective legislation.  That too in the context of 
United Kingdom is a constitutional principle.  Although, in our 
Constitution, the fundamental rights are not absolute yet they 
cannot simply be taken away by ordinary law.  They are only 
subject to reasonable restrictions.  The law relating to 
acquisition readily comes to mind when considering Acts of 
Parliament which apply retrospectively to past and closed 
transactions and accrued rights.  Yet the Constitution allows 
governments to do so subject to constitutional guarantees of 
public purpose and due compensation.  In acquisition, there is 
no doubt regarding the intention to whittle away accrued rights 
and it is within the contemplation of all persons adversely 
affected by the process. 
Section 4C and its impact on the appellants: 
46. 
There is no doubt that the businesses arrange their 
affairs on the current state of law as they would expect to 
confront at the end of a tax year.  There could be a myriad of 
financial considerations in the appreciation of businessmen, 
traders and merchants which impact their decision and all of 
them with an eye on that crucial date, that is, 30th June, 2022.  

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
27 
 
Interestingly, these considerations shall vary from one 
business to another depending on its peculiarities.  That is 
precisely the reason for providing the concept of a special tax 
year in section 74 of the Ordinance in contrast with the normal 
tax year.  Reading through the length and breadth of the 
Ordinance would inform the reader of the concept 
underpinning the computation of taxable income.  Section 9 of 
the Ordinance defines taxable income and provides that: 
9. Taxable income.—The taxable income of a person 
for a tax year shall be the total income under clause 
(a) of section 10 of the person for the year reduced 
(but not below zero) by the total of any deductible 
allowances under Part IX of this Chapter of the 
person for the year. 
 
Total income is a concept given in Section 10: 
10. Total Income.— The total income of a person for a tax 
year shall be the sum of the  
(a) person’s income under all heads of income for 
the year; and 
(b) person’s income exempt from tax under any of 
the provisions of this Ordinance. 
 
 
Then we come to Section 11 which deals with heads of 
income and Sub-section (2) provides that: 
(2) Subject to this Ordinance, the income of a 
person under a head of income for a tax year shall 
be the total of the amounts derived by the person in 
that year that are chargeable to tax under the head 
as reduced by the total deductions, if any, allowed 
under this Ordinance to the person for the year 
under that head. 
 
47. 
So the computation of taxable income comes about by 
reducing the total deductions from the total amounts derived 
by the person in that year that are chargeable to tax under the 
heads of income.  The provisions which follow relate to 
different heads of income.  A large number of appellants 
before us would be chargeable to tax under the heads of 
“income from business”.   
48. 
Before we proceed further, we may refer to the 
concept of income introduced by section 4C through Sub-
section (2) which has been reproduced above.  This definition 
of income for the purposes of section 4C would have to be 
juxtaposed against different provisions of the Ordinance so as 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
28 
 
to deduce the unfairness in applying the impost under Section 
4C to the tax year 2022. 
49. 
Section 18 relates to income from business and 
provides that: 
“18. Income from business.— (1) The following incomes 
of a person for a tax year, other than income exempt from 
tax under this Ordinance, shall be chargeable to tax under 
the head “Income from Business”— 
 
(a) the profits and gains of any business carried on by a 
person at any time in the year; 
 
(b) any income derived by any trade, professional or 
similar association from the sale of goods or provision of 
services to its members.  
 
Explanation.– For the removal of doubt, it is clarified that 
income derived by co-operative societies from the sale of 
goods, immoveable property or provision of services to its 
members is and has always been chargeable to tax under 
the provisions of this Ordinance; 
 
(c) any income from the hire or lease of tangible movable 
property; 
 
(d) the fair market value of any benefit or perquisite, 
whether convertible into money or not, derived by a person 
in the course of, or by virtue of, a past, present, or 
prospective business relationship. Explanation. — For the 
purposes of this clause, it is declared that the word 
‘benefit’ includes any benefit derived by way of waiver of 
profit on debt or the debt itself under the State Bank of 
Pakistan Banking Policy Department’s Circular No.29 of 
2002 or in any other scheme issued by the State Bank of 
Pakistan; 
 
(e) any management fee derived by a management company 
(including a modaraba management company. 
 
Explanation.—For the removal of doubt it is clarified that 
income subject to taxation under sections 5A, 5AA, 6, 7 and 
7A shall not be chargeable to tax under this section.” 
 
(2) Any profit on debt derived by a person where the 
person’s business is to derive such income shall be 
chargeable to tax under the head “Income from Business” 
and not under the head “Income from Other Sources”.  
 
(3) Where a lessor, being a scheduled bank or an 
investment bank or a development finance institution or a 
modaraba or a leasing company has leased out any asset, 
whether owned by it or not, to another person, any amount 
paid or payable by the said person in connection with the 
lease of said asset shall be treated as the income of the said 
lessor and shall be chargeable to tax under the head 
“Income from Business”.  
 
(4) Any amount received by a banking company or a non-
banking finance company, where such amount represents 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
29 
 
distribution by a mutual fund or a Private Equity and 
Venture Capital Fund out of its income from profit on debt, 
shall be chargeable to tax under the head “Income from 
Business” and not under the head “Income from Other 
Sources”. 
 
50. 
Similarly section 20 provides deductions in computing 
income chargeable under the head “income from business” 
and states that in computing the income of a person 
chargeable to tax under the head “income from business” for 
a tax year, a deduction shall be allowed for any expenditure 
incurred by the person in the year wholly and exclusively for 
the purposes of business.  Similarly, section 21 relates to the 
heads where no deductions are allowed in computing the 
income of a person. 
51. 
In a number of appeals before us the tax year for the 
taxpayers ends on dates prior to 30th June, 2022.  In respect of 
these appellants the clear inference is that they have 
discharged a number of their liabilities prior to 30th June 2022 
and in most cases these liabilities are irreversible.  We concur 
in the instances given by the Islamabad High Court as the 
obligations of such companies, at least, under different laws, 
and which are closely tied in with the concept of financial 
year / tax year.  The Companies Act, 2017 was one such 
statute to which a reference may be made.  Financial year has 
been defined as: 
“2(34) ―financial year‖ in relation to a company or any 
other body corporate, means the period in respect of which 
any financial statement of the company or the body 
corporate, as the case may be, laid before it in general 
meeting, is made up, whether that period is a year or not. 
 
 
52. 
Every company, by section 132, shall hold an Annual 
General Meeting within one hundred and twenty days 
following the close of its financial year, and by section 223, 
must lay before the company in AGM its financial statements, 
since the preceding financial statements.  Then in the AGM, 
dividends have to be declared.  The appellants in these 
categories have already completed these steps and a host of 
others which are in most part, irreversible.  They cannot be 
retracted and in the case of dividends, it is unlawful for the 
directors to withhold or defer its payment.  On the same 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
30 
 
analogy, it is well-nigh impossible for us to conceive 
obligations under other laws the detriments to which the 
appellants are subjected in the course of their businesses. 
53. 
Under Section 120 of the Ordinance, the concept of an 
assessment order has been introduced which provides that 
where a taxpayer has furnished a complete return of income 
for a tax year, the Commissioner shall be taken to have made 
an assessment of taxable income for that tax year and the tax 
due thereon and the return shall be taken for all purposes 
to be an assessment order issued to the taxpayer by the 
Commissioner on the day the return was furnished.  
Section 120 therefore encapsulates the principle which was 
being argued vehemently by learned counsel for the 
appellants that the liability stood fixed on 30th June 2022 (for 
normal tax year) and what was left merely was the furnishing 
of return of income which by law is deemed an assessment 
order.  The assessment order would be in respect of a taxable 
income for that year and the tax due thereon.  The amendment 
to the assessment year can only be made under certain 
circumstances mentioned in section 122 of the Ordinance.  
Other than that the matters between the revenue and the 
taxpayer come to a close on the filing of the return of income 
and nothing more is required to be done.  Therefore, in our 
opinion, section 120 of the Ordinance itself lends support to 
the contention raised by the appellants and crystallizes the 
liability on 30th June 2022. 
54. 
Section 137 of the Ordinance would also be relevant in 
the context brought forth by referring to section 120.  Sub-
section (1) of section 137 provides that: 
“(1) The tax payable by a taxpayer on the taxable income 
of the taxpayer including the tax payable under section 113 
or 113A for a tax year shall be due on the due date for 
furnishing the taxpayer’s return of income for that year. 
 
55. 
It clearly shows that the tax payable by a taxpayer for a 
tax year shall be due on the due date for furnishing the 
taxpayer’s return of income for that year.  Section 137 is 
inextricably linked to section 120 and is based on three stages 
which have been referred in earlier part of this opinion and 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
31 
 
relates to the assessment of tax while the declaration of 
liability has already been concluded on 30th June, 2022.  This 
is a stage which relates to payability of tax rather than 
determination of liability.  Thus, the conflating of various 
provisions of the Ordinance clearly means that the liability of 
a taxpayer is crystallized on 30th June, 2022 and thus for all 
intents and purposes the taxable income for the purposes of 
the Ordinance would stand determined on that date.  This 
would take the issue in the realm of past and closed 
transactions which cannot be reopened without clear words to 
this effect in the statute.  We do not discern such words to be 
part of section 4C of the Ordinance to conclude that past 
events and concluded rights have been taken away so as to 
impose super tax from the tax year 2022. 
56. 
Reverting to the substantially modified concept of 
“income” in section 4C, it has definitely enlarged its scope.  It 
not only includes taxable income (section 9) but also profit on 
debt, dividend, capital gains, imputable income etc.  For 
example, section 39 of the Ordinance deals with “income 
from other sources”: 
39. Income from other sources. — (1) Income of every kind 
received by a person in a tax year, if it is not included in 
any other head, other than income exempt from tax under 
this Ordinance, shall be chargeable to tax in that year 
under the head “Income from Other Sources”, including 
the following namely: —  
(a) Dividend; 
(b) royalty; 
(c) profit on debt; 
(cc) additional payment on delayed refund under any tax 
law; 
(d) ground rent; 
(e) rent from the sub-lease of land or a building; 
 (f) income from the lease of any building together with 
plant or machinery; 
(fa) income from provision of amenities, utilities or any 
other service connected with renting of building; 
(g) any annuity or pension; 
(h) any prize bond, or winnings from a raffle, lottery, prize 
on winning a quiz, prize offered by companies for 
promotion of sale] or cross-word puzzle; 
(i) any other amount received as consideration for the 
provision, use or exploitation of property, including from 
the grant of a right to explore for, or exploit, natural 
resources; 
(j) the fair market value of any benefit, whether convertible 
to money or not, received in connection with the provision, 
use or exploitation of property; 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
32 
 
(k) any amount received by a person as consideration for 
vacating the possession of a building or part thereof, 
reduced by any amount paid by the person to acquire 
possession of such building or part thereof; 
(l) any amount received by a person from Approved Income 
Payment Plan or Approved Annuity Plan under Voluntary 
Pension System Rules, 2005 
 (Ia) subject to sub-section (3), any amount or fair market 
value of any property received without consideration or 
received as gift, other than gift received from relative as 
defined in sub-section (5) of section 85.” 
 
57. 
It includes dividend, royalty, profit on debt and 
incomes of other kinds.  This, in the ordinary course, would 
be part of taxable income under section 9 of the Ordinance.  
These streams of income have once again been subjected to 
super tax by including them as income for the computation of 
tax under Section 4C.   There is no doubt in our minds that 
had the appellants contemplated such a levy for tax year 
2022, they would have pursued a different set of commercial 
plans to make a lawful effort to reduce the income and, in 
turn, to diminish the effect of super tax.  This could have been 
achieved in respect of all kinds of income made part of 
section 4C and within the standards of accounting practices in 
vogue. 
58. 
This brings us to the case of Commissioner of Income 
Tax, Peshawar v. Messrs Islamic Investment Bank Ltd. (2016 
SCMR 816) which was extensively quoted by the counsel for 
appellants as an authority for the proposition of accrual of 
liability on the last day of the tax year.  The Supreme Court 
held that: 
“…The tax laws are a body of rules and regulations under 
which the State has a claim on the taxpayers so that they 
may pay to the State a part of their incomes at the specified 
rates. This liability to pay income tax accrues on the 
taxpayer on the last day of the income year/accounting 
year, though the tax becomes payable after it is quantified 
in accordance with the procedures laid down in the 
Income Tax law. Thus a vested right in favour of the State 
is created at the end of each accounting year, though the 
exercise of (i) making an assessment on the basis of 
ascertainable data of income and expenditure, or (ii) 
revising an assessment order where it is found that there is 
sufficient material to hold that the original assessment was 
prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, takes place at 
some later stage. These procedural exercises are 
undertaken only with the object of reaching at the correct 
calculation of yearly income but the real liability to pay 
tax had already accrued on the last day of the income 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
33 
 
year i.e. on the last day of the accounting year thereby 
creating a vested right in favour of the State. It may be 
understood as an expense that has already accrued but is 
payable later. Reference can also be made to section 9 of 
the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, with regard to the 
creation of the charge on the basis of income year. Thus 
seeking revision of a tax return at any subsequent stage has 
nothing to do with the creation of charge on the tax-payer 
that has become absolute on completion of the income 
year/accounting year.” 
17. 
In light of the discussion undertaken in the 
preceding paragraph, it is clear that vested right to claim 
tax accrues on the last date of accounting year which 
under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, accrued 
up till 30.06.2002. This right cannot be taken away, even 
if there had been no saving clause in the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001. such right, being a vested right, gets 
automatically protected under the provisions of the 
general law i.e. section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 
1897. This vested right could have been taken away if a 
specific provision to that effect had been incorporated in 
the Ordinance, 2001 but that is not the case in the present 
matter. Thus irrespective of any accounting discrepancy 
that is sorted out on the basis of the procedural provisions 
of the income tax law at any subsequent stage, the charge 
of income tax on the taxpayer stands established on the 
last day of the income year/accounting year. In the present 
case, the last day of the last income year covered under the 
repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, was 30.6.2002, 
therefore, on all income years that ended on or before 
30.6.2002 the charge to recover tax had already been 
created on or before such date.” 
59. 
Doubtless, the rule explicated in the ruling applies on 
all fours to the present appeals.  It was said that the liability to 
pay income tax accrues on the last day of the income year.  
Thereafter a vested right was held to exist in favour of the 
State at the end of each accounting year, irrespective of 
procedural steps with the objects of reaching at the correct 
calculation of yearly income.  Finally, that the charge of 
income tax on the taxpayers stands established on the last day 
of the income year.  If the Supreme Court found a vested right 
to exist in favour of the State, the converse must be true as 
well and the appellants can rightfully argue that their 
liabilities stood determined on 30.06.2022 and on this basis 
only can the State exercise the vested right so conferred, to 
saddle them with taxes. 
60. 
Further reliance was placed on Fawad Ahmad Mukhtar 
and others v. Commissioner Inland Revenue (Zone-II), 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
34 
 
Regional Tax Office, Multan and another (2022 SCMR 426) 
and the following observations: 
“…Now, it is well established as a fundamental principle of 
income tax law that each tax year is a separate unit of 
account and taxation and the law has to be applied as it 
stood in respect of that tax year alone…” 
61. 
Thus, the nature of a tax year and its significance was 
underlined as a fundamental principle of tax law.  All 
liabilities that accrue in a tax year are past and closed 
transactions. 
Rights: 
62. 
The holding in Al-Samrez and Molasses Trading has 
blurred the line between a vested right and right under past 
and closed transaction.  This, in our opinion, has been 
unnecessarily muddled over the years by governments in the 
assertion of their dominant position.  We intend to remove the 
cobwebs surrounding the subject to lend clarity to it.  This 
will entail a deeper analysis on a jurisprudential level of what 
was intended by the use of two different terms by the 
Supreme Court in these cases. 
63. 
What then is a right and how are we to understand the 
language of rights? Clearly right (like duty) does not denote 
any entity whether physical, mental or fictional.  We do not 
seek to answer these conceptual questions in this opinion but 
will merely seek light from some of the concepts articulated 
by legal scholars and academicians, who have grouped rights 
in various ways.  Most frequently, both philosophers and 
jurisprudents have explained the notion of rights as a 
correlative with duties (or obligations) and this seems to be 
the whole idea permeating Al-Samrez and Molasses Trading.  
The right in one person logically implies a duty in another. 
64. 
In the essay written on Rights by Alan R. White, 
Ferens Professor of Philosophy in the University of Hull ( a 
seminal piece of literature), he noted that: 
“Quinn v. Leathem, Allen V. Flood, Mogul Steamsip Co. v. 
McGregor, and the later case of Sorrell v. Smith, make it 
quite clear that a right of A to pursue his own business does 
not imply a duty of B to refrain from (lawful) interference. 
Even in the usual passages quoted from Lords Lindley, 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
35 
 
Bowen, Halsbury, Ashbourne, and Parker the most that is 
said is that the duty correlative to a right is to refrain from 
unlawful or unjustified interference. Fry J. in Mogul 
Steamship Co. at 625 characterized the plaintiff’s right to 
trade as ‘not an absolute right, but a qualified _ a right 
conditioned by the like right in the defendant’s, and 
Mathews J. in Allen v. Flood at 26 said that the right could 
be invaded in fair competition. Cave J., whom Hohfeld 
quoted with approval as carefully distinguishing a right 
and a liberty, as indeed he does in Allen v. Flood at 29, 
held at 30 and 33 that it was ‘undoubted law’ that a trader 
had a right to carry on business without disturbance except 
in the way of fair competition – compare North J. at 40, 
Lord Ashbourne at 113, Lord Shand at 166 and 173. And 
when Channel J. distinguished, in Starey v. Graham 
referred to by Hohfeld, between a ‘right’ in the popular 
sense and a legal right, although he equated the former 
with something not forbidden by the law, he did not relate 
the latter to any correlative duty. Furthermore, later 
famous trade-dispute cases, such a Crofter Hand Woven 
Harris Tweed Co Ltd. V. Veitch and Rooks v. Barnard and 
Others, take the same view, as does the Trade Disputes Act 
1906 s. 3, which may even allow interference by unlawful 
acts, such as breach of contract.  
 
In fact, what seems to have happened in regard to 
the right to carry on one’s trade is that its legal protection 
has diminished gradually over the years in the interest of 
trade competition and union disputes from earlier more 
stringent safeguards rather than, as Hohfeldians assume, 
that it has become, or always was, merely a privilege or 
liberty. Allen v. Flood etc are simply landmarks in this 
change.” 
65. 
The inference is that a right to carry on trade and its 
legal protection has diminished gradually and does not imply 
a duty to refrain from lawful interference (Thus flows the 
power of legislature to enact a law retrospectively which 
would be a lawful invasion of the right). 
66. 
Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld’s 1913 article Fundamental 
Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning 23 Yale 
L. J.16 (1913) is a brilliant piece.  The architecture and 
arguments in the article remain relevant even today.  Hohfeld 
recognised the looseness of the usage and said that: 
“As already intimated, the term “rights” tends to be used 
indiscriminately to cover what in a given case may be a 
privilege, a power, or an immunity, rather than a right in 
the strictest sense; and this looseness of usage is 
occasionally recognized by the authorities.” 
 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
36 
 
 
He quoted with approval the language of Justice Sneed 
in Lonas v State (1871) 3 Heisk. (Tenn.) 287, 306-307: 
“The state, then, is forbidden from making and enforcing 
any law which shall abridge the privileges and immunities 
of citizens of the United States.  It is said that the words 
rights, privileges and immunities, are abusively used, as if 
they were synonymous.  The word rights is generic, 
common, embracing whatever may be lawfully claimed.” 
 
67. 
The emphasis, of course, is on the words “lawfully 
claimed” which means within the limits prescribed by law.  
Rights have synonymously been used as privilege, liberty or a 
legal claim to do. 
68. 
Now we turn to the definition of ‘right’ and its 
different forms given in Black’s Law Dictionary, ninth edition 
by Bryan A. Garner: 
“accrued right. A matured right; a right that is ripe for 
enforcement (as through litigation).” 
 
“legal right. 1. A right created or recognized by law. The 
breach of a legal right is usu, remediable by monetary 
damages. 2. A right historically recognized by common-law 
courts. Cf. equitable right. 3. The capacity of asserting a 
legally recognized claim against one with a correlative 
duty to act.” 
 
“vested right. A right that so completely and definitely 
belongs to a person that it cannot be impaired or taken 
away without the person’s consent.” 
 
69. 
The term ‘vested right’ as used in Al-Samrez is 
basically a right that completely and definitely belongs to a 
person and cannot be impaired or taken away without the 
persons’ consent.  It was in this context it was held that that 
right flowed from the existing notification and could not be 
altered by the second notification retrospectivity.  In Molasses 
Trading, on the other hand, the notion of past and closed 
transaction was used.  Yet this would also imply a right to 
inhere in a person on a transaction becoming past and closed! 
Such a right would, in our opinion, have proximity to the term 
‘accrued right’ defined above.  It would be a right that is ripe 
for enforcement, against all, including the legislature, and 
founded on a set of rules having provenance in the 
Constitution and settled legal principles.  It is also a legal 
right asserting a legally recognized claim against one with a 
correlative duty to act.

This distinction was sought to be elaborated by Munib 
Akhtar, J. (in the Sindh High Court), with his usual erudition, 
in Shahnawaz (Pvt.) Ltd. through Director v. Pakistan 
through the Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Government of 
Pakistan, Islamabad and another (2011 PTD 1558): 
“"11. The general principles applicable in relation to 
vested rights, and the extent to which they can be 
retrospectively affected, are well-settled and have been 
stated and reaffirmed many times...  
 
12. As even this brief account shows, some care must be 
taken to properly analyze the nature of the right under 
consideration. This is all the more so because (especially 
in the realm of fiscal statutes) past and closed 
transactions appear to stand on a footing higher than 
vested rights. This is clearly established by the decision 
in Molasses Trading and Export (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Federation 
of Pakistan and others 1993 SCMR 1905, a case relied 
on by learned counsel for the petitioners. The case was 
concerned with the grant of an exemption under the 
Customs Act, 1969. An exemption (which is granted by a 
notification issued under section 19 of the Act) can be 
regarded as a 'bare' right, one that can be availed of by 
the concerned importer. In the well-known case of Al-
Samrez Enterprise v. Federation of Pakistan 1986 SCMR 
1917, it was held that if the importer altered his position 
in reliance on the notification (e.g., by entering into a 
contract or opening a letter of credit), he acquired a 
vested right in the exemption, to which he remained 
entitled even if the exemption itself stood withdrawn by 
the time the goods arrived in Pakistan. The 'bare' right, 
in other words, had been transformed into a vested right. 
In order to undo the effect of this decision, section 31 A 
was added to the Customs Act (by the Finance Act, 
1988), and it was deemed always to have been part of the 
said Act. Thus, its position was, as presently relevant, 
similar to that of section 214C of the 2001 Ordinance. 
The question before the Supreme Court in Molasses 
Trading was whether section 31A had retrospectively 
destroyed the vested rights recognized in Al Samrez (the 
goods in question having been imported before 1-7-
1988). The Supreme Court unanimously held that the 
answer to this question was in the affirmative. However, 
by a majority, it was also held that those cases in which 
the bills of entry had been filed by or before 30-6-1988 
(i.e., before the Finance Act, 1988 came into force) had 
become past and closed transactions, and section 31A 
did not apply to them, notwithstanding the absolute terms 
in which it had, ostensibly, been given retrospective 
effect. The reason why the rights in those cases had gone 
from being vested rights to become past and closed 
transactions was that, in respect of customs duties, the 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
38 
 
levy of the tax stood crystallized on the date on which the 
bill of entry was filed. It is well-settled (see, e.g., the 
Ghulam Hyder Shah's case (supra)) that retrospective 
statutes affecting vested rights and/or past and closed 
transactions are to be given the narrowest effect and 
interpretation that is reasonably possible. Section 31-A, 
being concerned with undoing the effect of the Al Samrez 
case, was directed towards vested rights, and could not 
therefore affect past and closed transactions. Molasses 
Trading thus nicely illustrates both how rights can move 
along the 'scale' referred to above, and the distinction 
that exists between vested rights and past and closed 
transactions. In relying on this case, the petitioners 
clearly claim that their rights in the present case should 
be regarded as past and closed transactions, and hence 
remain unaffected by section 214C. Section 177 (under 
which the rights are claimed) must therefore be carefully 
analyzed in order to ascertain whether there are at all 
any rights thereunder and if so, whether they can be 
regarded as vested rights and/or as past and closed 
transactions."  
71. 
In our opinion, however, it would not be proper to 
derive meaning out of Al-Samrez and Molasses Trading 
purely on the basis of the use of different terms to denote 
rights.  They proceeded on facts materially different from one 
another.  In Al-Samrez, the issue was relating to an executive 
action sought to be applied retrospectively so as to whittle 
away rights.  This was discountenanced by the Supreme 
Court and in essence, the rule underpinning the decision was 
promissory estopple or one akin  to it.  The notion of vested 
rights was used to stonewall the executive’s attempt to undo 
concluded contracts made on the basis of the promise 
contained in the original notification.  Regarding facts in pari 
materia, the rule expounded in Al-Samrez still applies. 
72. 
Molasses Trading, on the other hand, was about 
legislature’s competence to enact laws retrospectively and 
thus constituted a challenge to the sovereign power of the 
State.  One can see that a far more formidable challenge was 
required to be mounted than the one in Al-Samrez.  The 
Supreme Court conceded that Parliament has power to 
legislate retrospectively so as to impair vested rights.  But, 
while doing so, carved out an exception for past and closed 
transactions.  Here one will notice on a fuller reading of 
Molasses Trading that at different places, the terms ‘vested 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
39 
 
rights’ and ‘past and closed transactions’ have been used 
interchangeably by the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court 
observed that “if effect is given to the provisions of section 
31A….a liability is being created for the payment of the tax.  
I cannot see anything in the language of section 31A, 
expressly or by necessary intendment, to that effect”.  Then 
the crucial words follow: 
“Such result is therefore not a necessary corollary of the 
fiction created by the deeming provisions of section 5 of the 
Finance Act, 1988. Otherwise also it will be contrary' of 
the principle, mentioned above, namely, that liabilities once 
fixed or rights created by operation of law upon facts or 
events, must not be disturbed by a general provision given 
retrospective effect unless such intention is clearly 
manifested by the language employed. In the case of 
Mehreen Zaibun Nisa (supra) retrospective effect was not 
given to the changed law so as to invalidate certain acts of 
legislature, although the entry in the relevant legislative list 
had been changed with retrospective effect.” 
 
73. 
It follows indubitably that merely relying on 
fundamental rights will not suffice for they are not absolute 
and do not draw a distinction on the basis of past transactions.  
They will not be abridged if the legislature does not clearly 
express the intention of undoing past and closed transactions 
so as to take away those rights as well.  Unless this is done, 
rights guaranteed by Articles 4, 23 and 24 protect these 
transactions and keep them inviolate. 
74. 
In summation, the nub of the arguments is that it will 
not serve any useful purpose to put a strained construction on 
words to draw a distinction between a vested right and one 
flowing from past and closed transactions.  Both belong to the 
species of legal rights that so completely and definitely vest 
in a person that they cannot be impaired or taken away.  
Hence, the legislature intending to take them away 
retrospectively, must use words which are clear, explicit and 
categoric leaving nothing to imagination.  This is because, 
while doing so, the legislature is making breath-taking 
inroads upon individuals’ rights to due process and property.  
We do not discern any such intention in the use of the words 
“for tax year 2022” in section 4C to impair the rights of 
appellants under past and closed transactions. 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023

ICA No.47905 of 2023 & connected appeals: 
(Appendix B) 
75. 
This appeal concerns with portion of the 
impugned judgment which determines the aspect of 
discrimination which, according to the learned counsel 
for the appellants before the learned Single Judge, 
inheres in the proviso to Division IIB of Part I of the 
First Schedule to the Ordinance (The Proviso).  The 
Proviso has been set out above and to reiterate provides 
separate class of persons engaged in the business of 
airline, automobiles, beverages, cement, chemicals, 
cigarettes and tobacco, fertilizer, iron and steel, LNG 
terminal, oil marketing, oil refining, petroleum and gas 
exploration and production, pharmaceuticals, sugar and 
textiles.  In respect of this class of persons the rate of tax 
was 10% where the income exceeds Rs.300 Million.  It 
will be recalled that the original Division IIB was 
inserted by Finance Act, 2022 and was substituted by 
Finance Act, 2023.  In its original form different slabs 
had been provided which gave the income of taxpayers 
and in case it exceeded Rs.150 Million a tax under 
Section 4C was imposed by the legislature.  Where the 
income exceeded Rs.300 Million, the rate of tax was 4% 
of the income.  The Proviso created a separate class 
within the class of taxpayers earning income exceeding 
Rs.300 Million and which constitute businesses 
enumerated above.  The case of the appellants before the 
learned Single Judge was that this was outwith the 
authority of the Parliament and offended Article 25 of 
the Constitution. This argument weighed with the 
learned Single Judge who proceeded to strike down the 
Proviso.  The Sindh High Court as well as Islamabad 
High Court were also swayed by these arguments and all 
three Courts have held the Proviso to be discriminatory.   
76. 
Learned counsel for the appellant, Ms. Asma 
Hamid, Advocate argued in this Court that while doing 
so the learned Single Judge did not advert to the material 
placed on record (though it was referred in passing the 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
41 
 
impugned judgment).  Primarily, three sets of documents 
have been relied upon by learned counsel for the 
appellants to contend that the creation of separate class 
of persons was permissible under Article 25 of the 
Constitution 
and 
was 
in 
consonance 
with 
the 
constitutional mandate.   
77. 
We will, at this juncture, reiterate the rule 
regarding classification vouched by the superior Courts 
and need not refer to the case law extensively which has 
been done by learned Single Judge and respectfully 
adopt the citations of precedents and their reliance for 
enunciation of the principles regarding Article 25 of the 
Constitution.  In a nub, classification can only be 
reasonable if it is based on intelligible criteria having 
nexus to the object sought to be achieved.  Further, 
classifications created on the basis of a separate class of 
persons which are similarly placed will not offend the 
fundamental right enshrined in Article 25 of the 
Constitution. 
78. 
The first document is a purported policy 
statement regarding imposition of super tax on high-
earning persons which seems to be the intention in 
enacting section 4C of the Ordinance.  This policy 
statement has ostensibly been prepared to pitch for the 
imposition of tax under Section 4C and seeks to target 
the rich to pay their due share in the economy in order to 
generate additional 215 billion to bridge fiscal gap.  For 
the purpose, super tax on high-earning persons was 
deemed as the solution being a tax on windfall profits of 
high-earning persons.  This policy statement and its 
contents perhaps translated ultimately in the imposition 
of super tax but interestingly the slabs of income were 
confined to taxpayers whose income exceeded Rs.300 
Million and the rate of tax was 4%.  The policy 
statement identified major sectors including the oil 
marketing sector, oil refinery sector, chemical sector etc. 
but did not at any place in the policy statement suggest 
that these sectors be treated differently and a higher rate 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
42 
 
of tax of 10% be imposed in respect of these sectors.  It 
seems that this document merely states a fact on the 
basis of data compiled by the managers who formulated 
the policy statement that 4% rate of tax must be imposed 
on sectors which have earned windfall profits.  This 
policy statement however did not find its way in the 
financial 
proposals 
of 
the 
Federal 
Government 
introduced before the National Assembly as Finance Bill 
2002.  Division IIB as proposed in the Finance Bill was 
to the following effect: 
Income under section 4C 
Rate of tax 
Where income does not 
exceed Rs.300 million 
0% 
of 
the 
income 
Where 
income 
exceeds 
Rs.300 million 
2% 
of 
the 
income 
 
79. 
As explicated, there were only two streams of 
income which were sought to be taxed under Section 4C 
and the rate of tax with regard to income exceeding 
Rs.300 Million was 2%.  This can also be gleaned from 
budget speech of the Finance Minister which merely 
stated that a tax on high-earning persons was sought to 
be imposed who would be required to pay 2% tax on 
annual income of Rs.200 Million or more.  It was during 
the speeches while the Finance Bill was being 
considered that the Finance Minister introduced the 
notion of another category of high-earning individuals 
which ultimately found mention in the Proviso.  Be that 
as it may, the Proviso was part of taxation measure 
ultimately enacted as a tax by National Assembly.   
80. 
The second set of documents relied upon by 
learned counsel for the appellant relates to annual 
reports of some of the companies comprised in the 
sectors enumerated in the Proviso.  These documents 
were referred by learned counsel for the appellant in 
order to bring home the submission that the companies 
comprised in these sectors have made windfall profits 
during these tax years to compel the legislature to 
impose a different rate of tax on these sectors.  The 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
43 
 
precise submission is that this would create a separate 
class of persons and prescribing a different rate of tax 
regarding this class of persons would not be offensive of 
Article 25 of the Constitution.  With regard to these 
documents suffice to say that although the annual reports 
relating to tax included in the Proviso have been placed 
on record as also data from the companies listed on 
Pakistan Stock Exchange, none of the documents relate 
to other companies which earn an income which exceeds 
Rs.300 Million but do not constitute part of the 
companies enumerated in the Proviso.  It is, therefore, 
difficult to assess on the basis of data produced before us 
or the learned Single Judge that only these companies 
were making windfall profits and none of other persons 
within the bracket of persons having income which 
exceeds Rs.300 Million.  If this were intended then the 
legislature ought to have created a separate and distinct 
category for taxpayers to be taxed at a different rate of 
tax on the basis that they were making windfall profits. 
81. 
The third document relied upon by learned 
counsel for the appellant is a data produced in Court 
during the course of arguments and which was not 
confronted to the respondents and data compiled by 
LTO, Lahore regarding collection of super tax in respect 
of different category of taxpayers including taxpayers 
liable to pay at the rate of 10% and the ones who are 
liable to make the payment at 4%.   
82. 
We are afraid that we cannot rely upon this 
document which is unverified and secondly has not been 
confronted to the respondents to rebut these statistics.  
Thirdly, the data is restricted to LTO Lahore and cannot 
be a determining factor with regard to issue of 
discrimination. 
83. 
The issue at the heart of this litigation in respect 
of discrimination is that different rates of taxation have 
been provided in Division IIB.  The Proviso identifies 
and narrows down certain sectors of businesses which, 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
44 
 
in the opinion of the legislature, generate windfall 
profits and, therefore, must be taxed at a different rate.  
While doing so, the fact has been ignored that there may 
be a number of persons who earn income exceeding 
Rs.300 Million and who may also be making windfall 
profits.  Those persons have been exempt from payment 
of tax at the rate of 10% and would be happy to be dealt 
a lesser rate of tax at 4%.  This is the discrimination writ 
large on the face of the Proviso and which, we believe, 
has now been rectified by substitution through Finance 
Act, 2023 where income exceeding Rs.500 Million has 
been imposed a rate of taxation at 10%.  Therefore, the 
anomaly has now been corrected by the legislature and a 
rate of tax across the board in respect of a particular 
category of taxpayers has been imposed.   Our 
precedents do not countenance such discrimination 
which has been held to be unconstitutional and contrary 
to the rule of law.  Certain sectors without any 
intelligible criteria cannot be isolated from rest of the 
persons similarly placed and sought to be taxed at a 
higher rate than those persons who earn an income in the 
same bracket.  This is precisely the holding of the Sindh 
High Court, Islamabad High Court and the learned 
Single Judge.  We do not find any illegality or error in 
the holding of the learned Single Judge in this respect. 
84. 
In the above analysis, we concur in the result 
reached by the Islamabad High Court and Sindh High 
Court (where similar challenges were brought).  We 
have, however, arrived at the same result by another 
route. 
85. 
In conclusion, it is held that: 
i. 
The appeals by appellants / taxpayers at 
(Appendix A) are allowed.  The part of the 
impugned 
judgment 
that 
upholds 
the 
retrospective application of section 4C by the use 
of the words “for the tax year 2022” is set aside.  
It is declared that, notwithstanding these words, 
the rights conferred on the appellants at the end 

 
ICA No.48745 of 2023 
45 
 
of tax year 2022 on 30th June 2022 are past and 
closed transactions and cannot be impaired or 
whittled away by the use of these words.  In sum, 
super tax under Section 4C cannot be imposed on 
these appellants for the tax year 2022. This 
obviously includes appellants with special tax 
year. 
ii. 
ICA No.47905 of 2023 and connected appeals 
filed by the department (Appendix B) are 
dismissed.
