MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This single judgment shall 
govern the instant appeal (F.A.O. No.90 of 2023) as well as Civil 
Revision No.670 of 2023, as both are arising from a common order 
dated 19th July, 2023, whereby on the one hand learned Civil Judge 
Class-I, Rawalpindi allowed petition under Section 20 of the 
Arbitration Act, 1940 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1940”) and on 
the other accepted application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred to as 
“C.P.C.”) moved by respondent No.1 (hereinafter referred to as 
“respondent”). It would not be out of context to mention here that 
appeal stems from the first part of the order whereas the revision 
petition ensues from second part. 

FAO No.90 of 2023

2. 
Facts forming background of the appeal as well as revision 
petition are that the appellant/petitioner being a charitable 
organization registered under the Charitable Endowment Act, 1980 
was created with the aim and object to provide accommodation, 
extend loans, provide incentives on no profit no loss basis and 
provide any other facility or help from time to time, for the welfare 
of the employees in the service of the National Command Authority 
(NCA). The “respondent” on the other hand is a business concern 
dealing with the business of land developing with whom the 
appellant/petitioner entered into an agreement dated 09th February, 
2021 for the purchase of land measuring 751 Kanal and 77 square 
feet (hereinafter referred to as “land in question”) against total sale 
consideration of Rs.550 million out of which an amount of Rs.50 
million was paid by the “respondent” as earnest money through pay 
order No.24407515 dated 08th February, 2021. In addition, the 
“respondent” also handed over post-dated cheques Nos.00000072 of 
PKR.25,00,00,000/- with maturity date of the first instalment i.e. 09th 
June, 2021 and 00000073 of PKR.25,00,00,000/- with maturity date 
09th August, 2022 as second instalment. The “respondent”, however, 
served a notice of force majeure dated 11th June, 2021 to the 
appellant/petitioner on account of COVID-19 pandemic and offered 
to make payment under the first instalment amounting to Rs.150 
million on or before 12th August, 2021 and remaining amount of 
Rs.100 million on or before 12th February, 2022 and also requested 
for return of post-dated cheque amounting to Rs.250 million in 
respect of first instalment, which was earlier handed over to the 
appellant/petitioner at the time of execution of agreement. The 
appellant/petitioner, however, while invoking clause 20 of the 
agreement terminated the contract on 23rd August, 2021. In this 
backdrop the “respondent” moved an application under Section 20 of 
the “Act, 1940” for appointment of arbitrator through the 
intervention of the court. The application was also accompanying an 
application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2 of the “C.P.C.” for the 
grant of temporary injunction. The appellant/petitioner submitted his 
replies to both the applications raising multiple preliminary 

FAO No.90 of 2023 
 
-3- 
 
objections and controverting the facts contained therein. By way of 
order dated 19th July, 2023 the learned Civil Judge Class-I, 
Rawalpindi proceeded to allow both the applications, which order is 
now under challenge. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant/petitioner contended that 
though an arbitration agreement was executed between the 
appellant/petitioner and “respondent” but while moving the 
application under Section 20 of the “Act, 1940” no cause was shown 
by the “respondent”, sufficient to proceed with the said application. 
It is contended with vehemence that default in payment of 
instalments is admitted by the “respondent” himself in the 
application, which leaves no room to further proceed with the 
application under Section 20 of the “Act, 1940”. Learned counsel 
argued that invocation of force majeure clause rendered the 
agreement void. In support thereof, learned counsel made reference 
to Section 36 & 65 of the Contract Act, 1872. Learned counsel 
emphatically contended that there was no occasion for the trial court 
to grant the temporary injunction in the circumstances. In order to 
supplement his contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on 
INDUSTRIAL FABRICATION COMPANY through M.D. versus MANAGING 
DIRECTOR, PAK AMERICAN FERTILIZER LIMITED (PLD 2015 Supreme 
Court 154), ABDUL WAHEED versus ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE and 
others (PLD 2021 Lahore 453) and SAMSONS GROUP OF COMPANIES 
versus PANTHER DEVELOPERS and others (2022 CLD 932). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for “respondent” while making 
reference to Section 20 of the “Act, 1940” submitted that for the said 
purpose the “respondent” has to show the existence of sufficient 
cause only. He added that the contents of application are clearly 
disclosing sufficient cause for proceeding with the matter. It is 
argued with vehemence that in terms of arbitration clause of the 
agreement any difference or dispute between the parties on any 
matter can be referred to the arbitrator as per the provisions of the 
“Act, 1940”. Learned counsel submitted that through impugned 
order, learned Civil Judge has only referred the matter to the 

FAO No.90 of 2023 
 
-4- 
 
arbitrator as per clause 24 of the agreement and this appeal is only to 
circumvent the proceedings. Learned counsel argued that temporary 
injunction was granted in favour of the “respondent” subject to 
deposit of remaining sale consideration and as such trial court 
committed no illegality under the law. In support of his contentions, 
learned counsel placed reliance on LAHORE STOCK EXCHANGE 
LIMITED versus FREDRICK J. WHYTE GROUP (PAKISTAN) LTD. and others 
(PLD 1990 Supreme Court 48), SEZAI TURKES FEYZI AKKAYA 
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, LAHORE through Project Director versus 
Messrs CRESCENT SERVICES, LAHORE and another (1997 SCMR 1928), 
Messrs SADAT BUSINESS GROUP LTD. versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN 
through Secretary and another (2013 CLD 1451) and BNP (PVT.) LIMITED 
versus COLLIER INTERNATIONAL PAKISTAN (PVT.) LIMITED (2016 CLC 
1772).

Heard. Record perused. 
6. 
The appellant/petitioner, being owner in possession of “land in 
question” categorized as entrance land and main land, duly described 
in attached schedule (annexures A, B, C and D with the agreement), 
entered into the agreement to sell with the “respondent” in lieu of 
sale consideration of Rs.550 million out of which the “respondent” 
being vendee paid an amount of Rs.50 million as earnest money on 
the date of execution of agreement through pay order No.24407515 
dated 08th February, 2021 issued by Habib Bank Limited, Satellite 
Town Branch, Rawalpindi. Both the parties mutually agreed on the 
following rate under which the land in question is to be 
proportionately transferred from both categories upon receipt of 
payment under the instalments provided herein :- 
“(5) The remaining consideration amount that is Rs. 
500,000,000/- (Rupees 500 Million) shall be paid in two 
instalments. The details of the instalments are provided in the 
following clauses. 
 
(6) 
The First instalment constitutes of amount that is 
Rs.250,000,000/- (Rupees 250 Million). The first instalment 
shall be paid by the Vendee upon completion of four (04) 
months from the date of execution of this Agreement. The 
Vendee shall provide a postdated cheque, bearing the above-
mentioned amount, on the date of execution of this Agreement, 
which shall mature on the due date of the first Instalment 

FAO No.90 of 2023 
 
-5- 
 
(subject to clause 12). The Vendor shall transfer the title of the 
Land proportionately from both categorizes (in case of transfer 
of Forty Six percent of the category A and Forty Six percent of 
category B shall be transferred keeping in view the 
compactness with already land owned by Vendee) detail 
description is given in Annex C and D as agreed among the 
parties as per clause (4) of this Agreement, in the name of the 
Vendee or his nominee, either through sanctioned mutation(s) 
or registered sale deed(s), upon the receipt of such payment. 
However, in case vendee make the payment of this instalment 
through pay order upon maturity of this period of 4 months 
then vendor shall be liable to transfer forty six percent of the 
land in favour of second party through the above said modes 
and shall also return the post-dated cheques to vendee upon 
receipt of payment. 
 
7) The Vendee may pay any amount under the first instalment 
before the requisite period stated therein, though not later than 
the said period, except as for the instance provided in clause 
(12). If any amount under the first instalment is paid before the 
stated period, then the Vendee shall notify in writing to the 
Vendor. The said payment shall be paid immediately by the 
Vendee, upon duly notifying the Vendor. While at the time of 
the said payment, the Vendee shall further provide a revised 
post-dated cheque bearing the remaining amount of the first 
instalment and Vendor shall return the post-dated cheques 
given earlier to vendee. The revised post-dated cheque shall 
mature on the due date of the first instalment subject to clause 
12. 
 
(8) If the Vendee pays any amount under clause (7) before the 
requisite period, the Vendor shall transfer the title of Land 
proportionately from both categories, as agreed among the 
parties as per clause (4) of this Agreement, in the name of the 
Vendor or his nominee (as per clause 2) either through 
sanctioned mutation(s) on registered sale deed upon receipt of 
payment. 
 
(9) The Second instalment shall constitute of amount that is Rs. 
250,000,000/- (Rupees 250 Million). The amount of Rs. 
50,000,000/- (Rupees 50 Million) provided as earnest money as 
per clause (3), shall also be adjusted with the second 
instalment. The second instalment will be paid by the Vendee 
upon completion of eighteen (18) months from the date of 
execution of this Agreement. The Vendee shall provide a post-
dated cheque bearing the above-mentioned amount, on the date 
of execution of this Agreement, which shall mature on the due 
date of the second instalment subject to clause 12. The Vendor 
shall transfer the title of the remaining Land in the name of the 
Vendee or his nominee, either through sanctioned mutation(s) 
or registered sale deed(s) upon receipt of said payment. 
 
(10) The Vendee may pay any amount under the second 
instalment before the requisite period stated herein, though not 
later than the said period, except as for the instance provided in 
clause (12). If any amount under the second instalment is paid 
before the stated period, then the Vendee shall notify in writing 
to the Vendor. The said payment shall be paid immediately by 
the Vendee, upon duly notifying the Vendor. While at the time 
of the said payment, the Vendee shall also provide a revised 
post- dated cheque bearing the remaining amount of the second 

FAO No.90 of 2023 
 
-6- 
 
instalment and Vendor shall return the post-dated cheques 
given earlier to vendee. The revised post-dated cheque shall 
mature on the due date of the second instalment (subject to 
clause 12). 
 
(11) If the Vendee pays any amount under clause (10) before 
the requisite period, the Vendor shall transfer the title of Land 
proportionately as agreed among the parties as per clause (4) of 
this Agreement, in the name of the Vendee, either through 
sanctioned mutation(s) or registered sale deed (s), upon receipt 
of payment.” 
7. 
Since the matter in issue is primarily arising out of application 
under Section 20 of the “Act, 1940”, so it would be apposite not to 
delve into rigmarole of facts and only ponder upon the question 
interse parties canvassed herein. Clause 24 is the arbitration clause of 
the agreement which reads as under :- 
“(24) If any difference or dispute between the parties on any 
matter arises hereunder, the same shall be referred to 
arbitration as per the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1940. 
The Director General Strategic Plans Division (DG SPD) or a 
person nominated by him and person nominated by Vendee 
shall be the Arbitrators. The place of Arbitration shall be 
Rawalpindi/Islamabad, Pakistan and the language of the award 
shall be English. Subject to the Arbitration Act, 1940, the 
award of the Arbitrators shall be final and binding on the 
Parties.” 
 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
8. 
In order to consolidate and amend the law relating to 
Arbitration, “Act, 1940” was passed by the Governor-General of 
India-in Council on 11th March, 1940 which was adopted in Pakistan 
through the Central Laws (Statute Reform) Ordinance (XXI of 
1960). Section 2(a) of the “Act, 1940” defines “arbitration 
agreement” as under :- 
“(a) 
“arbitration agreement” means a written agreement to 
submit present or future differences to arbitration, whether an 
arbitrator is named therein or not” 
Chapter III deals with arbitration with intervention of a court where 
there is no suit pending. Section 20 of the “Act, 1940” gives a choice 
to any persons who have entered into an arbitration agreement before 
the institution of any suit with respect to the subject matter of the 
agreement or any part of it, and where a difference has arisen to 
which the agreement applies, they or any of them, instead of 

FAO No.90 of 2023 
 
-7- 
 
proceeding under Chapter II, may apply to a Court having 
jurisdiction in the matter to which the agreement relates, that the 
agreement be filed in court. The “respondent” being privy to the 
arbitration agreement moved the application invoking Section 20 of 
the “Act, 1940”. It is an admitted position on all hands that there 
exists an arbitration agreement between the appellant/petitioner and 
the “respondent”. The resistance to the application under Section 20 
of the “Act, 1940” is two fold on behalf of the appellant/petitioner; 
firstly that in the light of admission of the “respondent” that he has 
committed default in payment of instalment, there remains no 
sufficient cause for referring the matter to the arbitrator(s) and 
secondly with the invocation of force majeure, claim of the 
“respondent” has become void on the touchstone of Section 36 read 
with Section 65 of the Contract Act, 1872. 
9. 
Sub-section (4) of Section 20 of the “Act, 1940” ordains that 
where no sufficient cause is shown, the court shall order the 
agreement to be filed, and shall make an order of reference to the 
arbitrator appointed by the parties, whether in the agreement or 
otherwise, or, where the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator, to an 
arbitrator appointed by the court. It was thus obligatory for the 
appellant/petitioner to demonstrate some sufficient cause, so as to 
persuade the court not to proceed in terms of Section 20 of the “Act, 
1940”. In other words, it can easily be inferred from the plane 
reading of sub-section (4) that there should be some extraordinary 
circumstances in which the court desist from passing an order that 
the agreement to be filed and matter should be referred to the 
arbitrator(s). Clause 24 of the agreement stipulates that any 
difference or dispute between the parties on any matter arises 
thereunder shall be referred to the arbitration which is clearly in the 
vast term.  
10. 
The question as to whether the “respondent” committed 
default in payment of instalments and as to whether the reasons for 
such default are justifiable; are the questions which could be raised 
before and determined by the arbitrator(s) appointed in accord with 

FAO No.90 of 2023 
 
-8- 
 
the arbitration clause embodied in the agreement. For referring the 
matter to the arbitrator(s) in terms of the “Act, 1940” the court 
cannot embark upon the fate of dispute, which ultimately be the 
outcome of proceedings conducted by the arbitrator(s). The terms 
“sufficient cause” used in sub-section (4) of Section 20 of the “Act, 
1940” is alike and akin to the phrase “where it does not disclose a 
cause of action” used in Rule 11(a) of Order VII of the “C.P.C.” 
which is one of the grounds for rejection of plaint recognized by the 
said provision of law. Needless to observe that proceedings in terms 
of Section 20 of the “Act, 1940” are though in the nature of 
proceedings in a suit but in strict sense it is not a suit. When such 
application is moved a show cause notice is to be issued to all the 
parties to the agreement requiring them to explain why agreement 
should not be filed. If sufficient cause is not shown to the contrary, 
the agreement is ordered to be filed. Guidance to this effect can be 
sought from LAHORE STOCK EXCHANGE LIMITED versus FREDRICK J. 
WHYTE GROUP (PAKISTAN) LTD. and others (PLD 1990 Supreme Court 
48). 
11. 
So far judgment in the case of Industrial Fabrication Company 
supra 
heavily 
relied 
upon 
by 
learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
appellant/petitioner is concerned, it is inter-alia observed that in the 
said case application under Section 20 of the “Act, 1940” was 
resisted by taking up the plea that the entire dispute interse parties 
was previously settled, therefore, no dispute was outstanding which 
could be referred to the arbitrator and in that backdrop the 
application under Section 20 of the “Act, 1940” was not acceded to; 
thus on account of dissimilarity of facts the judgment is not 
applicable to the present case. Similarly, the principles laid down in 
the case of Samsons Group of Companies supra are hardly attached to 
the case of the appellant/petitioner. 
12. 
So 
far 
contention 
of 
learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
appellant/petitioner that by invoking force majeure clause, the 
“respondent” has rendered the agreement void, it is observed that no 
such ground was taken in the reply to the application under Section 

FAO No.90 of 2023 
 
-9- 
 
20 of the “Act, 1940”. Even otherwise such question can be agitated 
before the arbitrator(s). An application under Section 20 of the “Act, 
1940” cannot be resisted on the ground that agreement has become 
void as it would be a premature step to stifle the arbitration clause 
and as such the judgment in the case of Abdul Waheed supra relied 
by learned counsel for the appellant/petitioner to this effect is not at 
all attracted to the present case as that runs on altogether different 
facts.  
13. 
It is also one of the contentions of learned counsel for the 
appellant/petitioner that agreement was terminated while invoking 
clause 20 of the agreement, suffice to observe that termination of 
contract by itself does not render the arbitration clause redundant. 
Even in case of termination of contract by one of the parties, matter 
can still be referred to the arbitrator(s) by the court in terms of 
Section 20 of the “Act, 1940”. Reliance in this respect can be placed 
on Messrs SADAT BUSINESS GROUP LTD. versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN through Secretary and another (2013 CLD 1451) wherein the 
Sindh High Court observed as under :- 
“12…… I do not find any strength nor persuaded with the 
arguments that in case a contract is terminated the arbitration 
clause does not survive. The termination/cancellation may 
occur due to breach in the contractual obligations by any of the 
parties to the contract which in fact leads towards a dispute and 
in order to resolve the dispute between the parties and even for 
the determination of their rights and liabilities and even a 
wrongful termination can also be made the subject matter of 
arbitration proceedings otherwise, the whole purpose and 
Scheme of incorporating an arbitration clause in the contract 
will become redundant and superfluous and it would be very 
easy for any party to terminate and or frustrate the contract out 
rightly in order to avoid arbitration proceedings and claims if 
any. The cancellation of contract or invoking arbitration 
proceedings both are two distinct situations, the termination 
clause cannot be given overriding effect on arbitration 
proceedings or the provision made for arbitration in the 
contract.” 
Reference to above effect can also be made to BNP (PVT.) LIMITED 
versus COLLIER INTERNATIONAL PAKISTAN (PVT.) LIMITED (2016 CLC 
1772). 
14. 
Adverting to the application for the grant of temporary 
injunction it is noticed that the “respondent” moved said application 

FAO No.90 of 2023 
 
-10- 
 
alongwith application under Section 20 of the “Act, 1940”, seeking 
temporary injunction pending proceedings and since he succeeded in 
establishing that sufficient cause exists to refer the matter to the 
arbitrator(s) so withholding the relief of temporary injunction would 
amount to circumvent and thwart the proceedings before the 
arbitrator(s). Even otherwise temporary injunction is granted in 
favour of the “respondent” subject to deposit of remaining sale 
consideration in toto in the court, which the “respondent” already 
deposited in terms thereof. Needless to reiterate that for the grant of 
temporary injunction one has to show the existence of prima-facie 
case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss. The “respondent” 
remained successful in the said test. In somewhat similar 
circumstances this Court in the case of Messrs PETROSIN PRODUCTS 
(PVT.) LIMITED through Representative and others versus GOVERNMENT OF 
PAKISTAN through Secretary, Privatization Commission of Pakistan, Ministry 
of Finance Government of Pakistan, Islamabad and 3 others (2000 MLD 785) 
held as under :- 
“10……..The acceptance of the plea of the petitioner for 
referring the matter to the Arbitrator prima facie proves that a 
dispute had arisen between the parties which required 
determination through arbitration. It was, therefore, not 
justified for the learned Civil Judge to deny the relief of 
temporary injunction after he had referred the dispute between 
the parties to the Arbitrator for determination. It is also 
admitted fact that till this date the Guarantee submitted by the 
petitioner has not been encashed because of the earlier stay 
order issued by the Civil Court and then by this Court. Hence, 
at this belated stage when even the arbitration award has been 
filed in the Court, it would not be in the interest of justice to 
deny the interim relief prayed by the petitioner as the same 
would render the whole proceedings as infructuous.” 
15. 
For the foregoing reasons, appeal as well as revision petition 
being bereft of any merits are dismissed with no order as to costs.
