AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J. Through this Civil 
Revision, filed u/s 115 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the 
petitioner assailed the vires and legality of the judgment and decree 
dated 27.05.1993, whereby, the Court of learned District Judge 
while accepting the appeal of respondent No.3, set-aside the 
judgment and decree of learned trial Court dated 18.04.1990 and 
consequently dismissed petitioner’s suit for declaration with 
permanent injunction.

Facts in brevity are that petitioner/plaintiff (herein 
after referred to as the petitioner) instituted a suit for declaration 
with permanent injunction on 08.10.1986 against the respondents/ 
defendants i.e. Abdul Ghaffar defendant No.1/(respondent No.1), 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993. 
-2-
Aslam son of Nabi Bakhsh defendant No.2 (respondent No.2), 
Rehmat Ullah defendant No.3 (respondent No.3) with the 
contention that he purchased land measuring 08 kanals through 
registered sale deed No.1018 dated 18.09.1984 for a consideration 
of Rs.40,000/- from respondent No.1 and through private settlement 
got possession of khasra No.55/25 measuring 08 kanals; that 
registered sale deed was handed over to the concern Patwari for 
incorporation in the revenue record and he went to England in the 
last days of September, 1984; that he came back in July 1986; that 
respondent No.1 and Patwari concern with the connivance of each 
other did not allow to incorporate the said registered deed in the 
revenue record and after entry of the mutation got it cancelled on 
the strength that he was not previous owner in the Deh, therefore, it 
is violation of the Martial Law Regulation, hence, mutation cannot 
be sanctioned; that he, after the death of his father on 29.06.1984, 
had become owner in the said Deh and he purchased land through 
said sale deed afterwards on 18.09.1984; that concern Patwari 
malafidely did not incorporate the inheritance mutation of his father; 
that respondent No.1, after cancelling the mutation from his name, 
transferred the suit property to respondents No.2 & 3 through 
mutations No.563 dated 17.05.1985 and mutation No.585 dated 
08.03.1986; that said mutations are against facts and law and 
having no effect upon his rights and sought declaration that in the 
light of registered sale deed No.1018 dated 18.09.1984 he will be 
declared owner in possession of the suit property; that the said sale 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993.

deed to be incorporated in the revenue record and the mutation 
No.563 dated 17.05.1985 and mutation No.585 dated 08.03.1986 to 
be cancelled being against the facts & law and based upon mala fide. 
Respondent No.1 resisted the suit through filing contested written 
statement by raising preliminary objections such as that the 
petitioner has no cause of action against him; that the petitioner 
filed the suit malafidely and he has no locus standi; that the 
petitioner instituted false and frivolous suit, therefore, costs under 
Section 35-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 be awarded. 
While replying on facts, he admitted the execution of the registered 
sale deed in favour of the petitioner, however, maintained that 
possession with regard to square No.55 killa No.25 was not given 
to him. He also maintained that the impugned mutations were 
rightly sanctioned and took a specific stance that when the mutation 
on the basis of sale deed was not sanctioned in favour of the 
petitioner then his brother gathered the respectable of the area 
where he (respondent No.1) returned the consideration amount to 
him and finally prayed for dismissal of the suit. Respondents No.2 
& 3 also filed contested written statement wherein they took 
preliminary objections that the petitioner has no cause of action 
against them; that the petitioner has no locus standi to institute the 
suit; that they (defendants No.2 & 3) have no concern with the suit 
property, therefore, they are entitled to receive costs under section 
35-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. While replying on facts, 
they pleaded that they got attested the sale mutations after 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993.

payments of cash amount and also got the possession of square 
No.55 Killa No.24 situated at Chak No.21/11-L and said property 
was in their possession since then and they have no concern with 
square No.55 Killa No.25 of the said Chak. They also pleaded that 
plaintiff’s brothers get back consideration amount from respondent 
No.1 and prayed for dismissal of the suit. The learned trial Court, 
keeping in view the divergent pleadings of the parties framed 
necessary issues, invited the parties to produce their respective 
evidence and after recording evidence of the parties, pro and contra, 
oral as well as documentary, decreed the suit vide judgment and 
decree dated 18.04.1990. Feeling aggrieved, only respondent No.3 
namely Rehmat Ullah preferred an appeal. The learned appellate 
Court allowed the said appeal while setting-aside the judgment and 
decree of the learned Trial Court through impugned judgment and 
decreed dated 27.05.1993 and consequently, dismissed petitioner’s 
suit. Being dissatisfied the petitioner approached this court through 
instant Civil Revision.

I have heard learned counsel for the parties at full 
length and perused the record with their able assistance. 
4. 
 
Admittedly, respondent No.1 Ghaffar Ahmad alias 
Abdul Ghaffar was owner of land measuring 14 kanals 02 marlas 
situated at Khewat No.36 khatoni No.203, Chak No.21/11-L Tehsil 
Chichawatni, District Sahiwal out of the total land of the khatta 
measuring 192 kanals 03 marlas. There is no denial with the fact 
that said respondent No.1 sold land measuring 08 kanals through 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993. 
-5-
registered sale deed No.1018 dated 18.09.1984 for a consideration 
of Rs.40,000/- to the petitioner. Original sale deed was brought on 
record as Exh.P-7 whereas attested copy of the said sale deed was 
placed on record as Exh.P-8. On the basis of said registered sale 
deed mutation No.534 (Exh.P-4) was entered in the mutation 
register. The said mutation was cancelled vide order dated 
18.05.1985 on the grounds that the petitioner/vendee is not owner 
in the said Chak/Deh, therefore, it is violation of Martial Regulation. 
From perusal of record it appears that respondent No.1 sold his 
remaining land measuring 06 kanals 02 marlas through oral sale 
mutation No.563 dated 17.05.1985 to respondent No.2 namely 
Aslam son of Nabi Bakhsh. Said sale was completed before the 
cancellation of mutation No.534. Therefore, said sale (mutation 
No.563 dated 17.05.1985) cannot be declared null and void and suit 
to this extent is not maintainable.  
After cancellation of mutation No.534 which was cancelled 
on 18.05.1985, respondent No.1 allegedly sold the suit 
property/subject matter of the sale deed to respondent No.3 for a 
consideration of Rs.30,000/- through oral sale mutation No.585 
dated 08.03.1986 (Exh.P-5). 
5. 
 
It is matter of fact that the registered sale deed dated 
18.09.1984 (Exh.P-7/Exh.P-8) through which respondent No.1 sold 
the suit property to the petitioner was neither challenged by the 
respondents nor cancelled by any competent authority. The 
petitioner was aggrieved from the order of revenue officer dated 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993. 
-6-
18.05.1985 whereby mutation No.534, entered on the strength of 
registered sale deed dated 18.09.1984 was cancelled on the grounds 
that he is not owner in the Deh and the sale made in his favour is in 
violation of Martial Law Regulation.  
6. 
 
Now the question arises whether revenue officer was 
competent to cancel the mutation which was entered on the basis of 
registered sale deed.  
7. 
 
The revenue officer was duty bound to incorporate 
registered deed in the revenue record. The revenue officer had no 
authority to cancel such mutation without giving notice to the 
purchaser and providing opportunity of hearing. 
8. 
 
Provision of Section 25(4) of the West Pakistan Lands 
Reforms Regulation (Martial Law Regulation No.64 of 1959) 
forbade the alienation by sale, mortgage, gift or otherwise by a 
person owing an area equal to or less than a subsistence holding to 
a person other than owner of the same village, Deh or Mouza. For 
reference Section 25(4) of M.L.R. No.64 of 1959 is reproduced as 
under: - 
“No person owing an area equal to or less than a subsistence 
holding shall be allowed to alienate by sale, mortgage, gift or 
otherwise any party of his holding: 
Provided that such a person may alienate his entire holding, 
or in the case of a holding which is less than a subsistence 
holding, sell any part of his holding to other owners of the 
same village, deh or mauza. 
Nothing in this paragraph shall apply to land whether 
cultivable or otherwise, which is bona fide required for the 
purpose for building thereon, and any tenant in possession of 
such land who refuses to quit after notice may be evicted 
under the order of the Deputy Commissioner.” 
 
 
M.L.R. No.64 of 1959 was repealed by M.L.R. 115 on 
11.03.1972. With regard to Section 25(4) of M.L.R. No.64 of 1959 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993. 
-7-
paragraph No.24(4) of Land Reforms Regulation, 1972 (Martial 
Law Regulation No.115 of 1972) was introduced which also does 
not allow a person other than owner of the same Deh, village or 
Mouza to purchase the land from a person owner of holding less 
than a subsistence holding and alienating part of his holding. For 
reference paragraph No.24(4) of M.L.R.No.115 of 1972 is 
reproduced as under: - 
“No person owing an area equal to or less than a subsistence 
holding shall be allowed to alienate by sale, mortgage, gift or 
otherwise any part of his holding: 
Provided that he may alienate the entire holding or in the 
case of holding which is less than a subsistence holding, he 
may alienate any of his presumptive heirs or exchange with, 
or mortgage or otherwise alienate to other powers or landless 
tenants of the same village, deh or mouza.” 
 
 
From bare reading of said provision it appears that there is a 
restriction upon the owner of a holding for alienation through sale, 
gift or otherwise of any portion of his holding which might reduce 
the size of his holding to an area below the limit of an economic 
holding and also forbade a person owing an economic holding to 
reduce the same through alienation which might reduce the size of 
his holding to subsistence holding. However, there is no restriction 
to alienate his entire holding. The same restriction also imposed 
upon a person owing subsistence holding. However, he may 
alienate his entire holding. 
 
In case of owning land, which is equal to or less than a 
subsistence holding also forbade a person for alienation of any part 
of his holding. However, he may alienate the entire holding or any 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993. 
-8-
part of his holding to only those who are owners or land less tenant 
of the same village, Deh or Mouza. 
9. 
 
The provision of M.L.R. 115 of 1972 was not meant to 
be utilized for the benefit of unscrupulous person and to give him 
undue benefits. Para 24 of M.L.R. 115 of 1972 could not be used 
for cancellation of sale, whereby, the alienation of the property 
through registered sale deed by the vendor in favour of vendee was 
completed. Vendor could not be permitted to take back the property 
without paying the price he had already received from the vendee 
and could not be allowed to turn turtle by taking a chance of legal 
interpretation and getting the sale transaction declared void. No law 
and rules of ethics and tenets of Islam allowed such a course to be 
adopted.  
 
This Court in a case “FAIZULLAH versus MUHAMMAD 
SARWAR and another” (2013 CLC 1054) wherein mutation 
attested on the basis of registered sale deed subsequently cancelled 
by Consolidation Officer to be violative of para No.24 of Land 
Reforms Regulation, 1972 held as under: - 
“When the transfer of property is made through registered 
document, there are some presumptions attached to a 
registered document under Articles 85(5) of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 and the mutation on the basis of said 
document under the law will remain intact till the time said 
registered document is in existence. The mutation attested on 
the basis of a registered document cannot be subsequently 
cancelled. I have observed that in the sale-deed in favour of 
plaintiff-appellant, the vendor of land has clearly stated that 
he is selling out the whole of his land in the Mouza and if 
inadvertently any land remains out of the sale-deed, the 
Revenue Officer will be at liberty to sanction the mutation of 
sale of that land also and he will not raise objection in this 
regard. In this eventuality, the Revenue Officer was bound 
under the law to attest the mutation of whole of land owned 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993. 
-9-
by the plaintiff-appellant in that Mouza and even if the 
mutation was not attested for whole of the land of seller in 
the name of vendee i.e. plaintiff-appellant, then the 
Consolidation Officer who has reviewed the mutation has 
absolutely no authority to review the mutation sanctioned by 
the Revenue Officer on the basis of a registered document. 
The authority to check the violation of Martial Law 
Regulation was with the Land Reforms Authorities. Even 
land reforms authorities were having a limited authority and 
cannot set aside the registered document. The provision 
promulgated through para 24 of the Land Reforms 
Regulation 1972 (M.R.R.115) has been declared against the 
injunction of Islam by the Federal Shariat Court in a 
judgment reported as “PLD 1989 Federal Shariat Court 80 
(Sajwara and others v. Federal Government of Pakistan)”. 
 
10. 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled 
“MST. AISHA BIBI V. NAZIR AHMAD AND OTHERS (1994 
SCMR 1935) held that Revenue officer while exercising his power 
under the Land Revenue Act, 1967 could not simultaneously act 
under Land Reforms Regulation and if he was of the view that any 
provision of said Regulation had been violated, his duty was to 
refer the matter to the Land Commissioner or Deputy Land 
Commissioner who was supposed to be the principal officer of the 
District concerning land disputes. 
 
Facts of the said case are that a sale effected by means of 
registered sale deed was incorporated in the revenue record by 
attesting the mutation. The Assistant Collector reviewed the 
mutation on the ground that it is violative of Martial Law 
Regulation. An appeal and then revision were dismissed by the 
Collector and the Additional Commissioner. The said orders were 
challenged by the vendees in the Civil Court, the suit was partially 
decreed by the learned trial Court. Both the parties filed appeals 
which were dismissed. The vendees then filed R.S.A., in this court 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993. 
-10-
while cross objections were filed by the vendors. The R.S.A. was 
allowed and the said orders were declared to be void and the suit 
was decreed on the ground that only the Land Commissioner or the 
Deputy Land Commissioner appointed thereunder can take 
cognizance of the matter. The vendors approached the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan and their C.P.L.A., was dismissed and 
the said judgment of this Court was upheld and declared as under: - 
“The suit land was sold by the Chuhar, the original owner, in 
favour of Nazir Ahmad, Bashir Ahmad and Aziz Ahmed 
respondents 1 to 3 through a registered sale-deed which was 
followed by a mutation as the revenue officers were bound to 
give effect to all transactions completed through registered 
deeds in the Revenue Record. There being no mistake 
apparent on the face of record, the Revenue Officer in the 
exercise of their review could not set aside the earlier order 
of attestation of mutation thereby annulling the solemn 
transaction of sale entered into between the vendor and the 
vendees in respect of the valuable landed property, moreso, 
on the grounds regarding which the jurisdiction expressly 
vested in the Land Commission or their subordinate officers 
and not in any other forum including the Civil Court. Since 
the hierarchy of Revenue Officers act in different capacities 
under different laws, it appears that the Revenue Officer also 
being vested with the powers of Land Commissioner reviewed 
the mutation on grounds available under Martial Law 
Regulations, and the whole exercise was conducted under this 
mistaken belief. There is no denying the fact, that when an 
officer acts under different statute he has to strictly follow the 
procedure embodied therein and cannot exercise his powers 
availing the provision of other statute. Apparently, the 
Revenue Officer while exercising his powers of review under 
the Land Revenue Act could not simultaneously act under 
Martial Law Regulation concerned and if he was of the view 
that any provisions of the Martial Law Regulation had been 
violated, his duty was to refer the matter to the Land 
commission or the Deputy Land Commissioner who was 
supposed to be the principal officer of the district concerning 
land disputes.” 
 
 
In another case titled as “Syed FAKHAR IMAM SHAH and 
others versus ABDUL HAQ (deceased) through L.Rs and others” 
(2006 SCMR 550) it was observed that vendor would have no legal 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993. 
-11-
or moral justification to challenge validity of a sale effected in 
violation of provision of Para 24 of M.L.R.115 of 1972. Such 
transactions as between vendor and vendee would not be altogether 
void even if there was violation of some provision of M.L.R. 115 of 
1972. Para 24 placed restriction more on a vendor then a vendee. 
Vendor could not take any advantage of his own wrong being in 
pari delicto and held as under:-  
“We find that the petitioners/vendors having alienated their 
land, by way of sale had no legal or moral justification to 
challenge its validity. Even otherwise, such a transaction as 
between the vendors and the vendees would not be altogether 
void even if there was violation of some provisions of 
M.L.R.115. Reference may usefully be made to the cases of 
Mst. Zuhra Khatoon and 8 others v. The Member Land 
Commission, Rawalpindi 1985 SCMR 312 and Mst. Raj Bibi 
and 4 others v. Additional Chief Land Commissioner, Punjab 
and 2 others PLD 1975 Lah. 408.” 
 
Further held: 
“Needless to observe that paragraph 24 of the Regulation 
places restrictions more on a vendor than a vendee.” 
 
 
The apex Court of the country while following the dicta laid 
down in Mst. Aisha Bibi’s case, observed in a case “Muhammad 
Ishaq v. Muhammad Shafique and 09 others” (2007 SCMR 1773) 
held as under: - 
“From the arguments of the learned counsel on either side, 
we have observed that the present scenario has three facts, 
firstly, whether the question of a transaction being violative 
of M.L.R. 115 can be determined by revenue authorities. We 
believe, it cannot. Even if, some Revenue Officer detected any 
irregularity, it was incumbent upon him to have referred the 
matter 
to 
Land 
Commission 
or 
the 
Deputy 
Land 
Commissioner, being the Principal Officer of the District in 
the given hierarchy. In the instant case, the order of Revenue 
Officer declaring the transaction void, was itself void. This 
Court has already taken this view in Mst. Aisha Bibi’s case 
1994 SCMR 1935.” 
 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993. 
-12-
11. 
 
No doubt, mutation is not a deed of title and even if 
the mutation sanctioned on the strength of the sale deed is stood 
cancelled, the real and genuine deed of title in shape of registered 
sale deed still existed in favour of vendee and on the strength of 
which he remained owner of land and vendor had no right to sell 
the same to others. Any number of subsequent entries illegally 
made in revenue record could not have effect of extinguishing right 
of rightful owner. Purchaser through registered sale deed would not 
cease to be owner due to cancellation of mutation in his favour. It 
was held in Muhammad Ishaq’s case (supra) that: - 
“Lastly, one may say, at the cost of repetition in every third 
civil case, that mutation is not a deed of title. In the instant 
case, even if mutation No.925 stood cancelled, the real and 
genuine deed of title existed in favour of Muhammad Ishaq in 
the shape of registered deed No.673 of 22.02.1978. On the 
strength of such registered deed, Muhammad Ishaq remained 
owner of 29 kanals and Ali Muhammad had no right to sell 
05 kanals therefrom in favour of Muhammad Shafique.” 
 
12. 
 
The petitioner specifically pleaded in his plaint that his 
father namely Bashir Ahmad son of Muhammad Khan was owner 
of land in the said Deh (mouza 21/11-L) who died in a road 
accident on 29.06.1984, therefore, he became owner in the Deh 
being his successor. In order to prove his stance, he produced 
Muhammad Usman Secretary Union Council as PW-1 who 
deposed that he has brought with him record of death register 
wherein at serial No.9 factum of the death of Raja Bashir Ahmad 
son of Muhammad Khan (father of the petitioner) on 29.06.1984 in 
a bus accident was incorporated on 13.07.1984 and produced copy 
of the death register as Exh.P-1. Said document verified his 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993. 
-13-
contention. The petitioner also produced copy of inheritance 
mutation No.604 dated 12.07.1986 as Exh.P-6. Perusal of said 
document it appears that inheritance of Bashir Ahmad was 
sanctioned in favour of his legal heirs including the petitioner. Said 
property was situated in Mauza 21/11-L wherein, the suit property 
was located. Although an objection was raised to the effect that said 
mutation was sanctioned on 12.07.1986 whereas registered sale 
deed was executed prior in time on 18.09.1984, therefore, petitioner 
was not owner at the time of execution and registration of the sale 
deed. There is no force in the said arguments as the petitioner had 
become owner in the Deh as soon as his father died. The evidence 
available on the record in shape of statement of Secretary Union 
Council (PW-1) and copy of death register (Exh.P-1) clearly 
suggests that the petitioner’s father namely Bashir Ahmad was died 
on 29.06.1984, therefore, at the time of execution of the sale deed, 
he was owner in Deh on the basis of inheritance.  
13. 
 
The respondents specifically respondent No.1 did not 
denied the sale of suit property to the petitioner through registered 
sale deed dated 18.09.1984. The stance of the respondents is that 
when the mutation No.534, incorporated on the basis of registered 
sale deed, was cancelled then brother of the petitioner contacted 
respondent No.1 who returned the consideration amount to the 
petitioner through his brother. Said fact was also maintained by the 
other two respondents i.e. respondents No.2 & 3 in their written 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993. 
-14-
statement. The learned trial Court with regard to the said 
proposition framed issue No.7 in the following terms: - 
Whether defendant No.1 has repaid the amount of 
consideration, if so, its effect? OPD 
 
14. 
 
The learned trial Court placed onus probandi of this 
issue upon the respondents. Respondent No.1 namely Ghaffar 
Ahmad alias Abdul Ghaffar did not appear in the witness box to 
prove his contention that he returned the consideration amount to 
the petitioner. Respondent No.3 namely Rehmat Ullah appeared as 
DW-1. He deposed that Abdul Ghaffar told him that he returned the 
consideration amount to the petitioner. In this way his evidence is 
merely hearsay evidence. Ghulam Rasool son of Nabi Bakhsh 
appeared as DW-2. He also deposed that they heard that petitioner 
got the suit property, but mutation was cancelled and consideration 
amount was returned to him. During cross examination, he 
maintained that consideration amount was not returned to the 
plaintiff (the petitioner) in his presence. His deposition is also based 
upon hearsay. The petitioner produced his real brother and general 
attorney namely Sabir Ahmad as PW-3. He produced copy of 
registered general power of attorney as mark-A. He deposed that 
defendant No.1 (respondent No.1) did not return the consideration 
amount to him. During cross examination in reply of a suggestion 
maintained that it is incorrect that they received consideration 
amount before the Punchyat and voluntarily said that no Punchyat 
was convened in this regard.  Respondents miserably failed to 

                           Civil Revision No.485-D of 1993. 
-15-
prove that consideration amount was returned by respondent No.1 
to the petitioner after cancellation of the mutation. 
15. 
 
Respondent No.1 sold the suit property through 
registered sale deed dated 18.09.1984 (Exh.P-7 & P-8) to the 
petitioner for a consideration of Rs.40,000/- but  he sold the same 
suit property to respondent No.3 through oral sale mutation No.585 
dated 08.03.1986 (Exh.P-5) for a consideration of Rs.30,000/- Sale 
of the suit property after about one and half year for a lesser amount 
than that was made through the sale deed also creates doubts about 
the genuineness of the sale executed through oral sale mutation in 
favour of respondent No.3.  
16. 
 
The learned Appellate Court while accepting the 
appeal of respondent No.3 much emphasized that protection under 
Section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is available to the 
respondent No.3.  
 
It is matter of record that the petitioner specifically pleaded 
in his plaint that he purchased land measuring 08 Kanals through 
registered sale deed No.1018 dated 18.09.1984 and got possession 
over specific Khasra No.55/25 (square No.55, Killa No.25). The 
respondents No.2 & 3 in their written statement narrated that they 
purchased the property through oral sale mutations after payment of 
consideration amount and got the possession over square No.55, 
Killa No.24 and specifically maintained that they have no concern 
with square No.55, Killa No.25. For reference, reply of para No.4 is 
reproduced hereunder in verbatim:

While recording his statement as D.W.1, respondent No.3 Rehmat 
Ullah deposed that he purchased the suit property from Abdul 
Ghaffar who delivered possession over Khasra No.55/24. He also 
maintained that Ghaffar told them that mutation sanctioned with 
regard to Khasra No.25 had been set-aside. He further stated that 
Abdul Ghaffar told that he returned the consideration amount. His 
exact deposition is as under:-

From the above stated facts, it is abundantly clear that 
respondent No.3 never took a specific plea that he is bona fide 
purchaser of the suit property for value without notice of the sale 
executed in favour of the petitioner. Rather he took a stance that he

-17-
purchased the property of Killa No.24 after cancellation of the 
mutation and has no concern with the property of Killa No.25. 
Meaning thereby, he is well aware that petitioner claimed 
ownership of the property situated at Killa No.25 and it was also in 
his knowledge that mutation entered in the name of petitioner was 
cancelled.  
 
Person claiming protection under Section 41 of the Transfer 
of Property Act, 1882 is bound to establish that the person from 
whom the suit property has been transferred to him was an 
ostensible owner, while transfer so made was with the consent of 
the real owner, either express or implied. Said transfer must have 
been made for some consideration and the person being transferee 
or purchaser must have acted in good faith and taken all reasonable 
care and steps before entering into said transaction for transfer. If 
anyone of the stated ingredients is wanted, then the transferor will 
not be eligible to seek protection of equitable doctrine envisaged 
under Section 41 of the Act ibid. 
 
Sanctity is attached to a registered document and it is 
considered a notice to the public at large. In order to dislodge said 
presumption mere inquiry of the revenue record was not sufficient. 
The entries of Revenue record are not foundation of title as said 
entries were made for fiscal purposes.  
 
In the present case, neither respondent No.3 specifically 
sought protection under Section 41 of the Act ibid nor established 
said fact through any evidence.

In view of above discussion, it is clear that sale deed 
executed in favour of the petitioner still remained intact and no one 
had challenged the validity and legality of said sale deed. Although, 
mutation No.534 had been cancelled, even then petitioner was 
owner of the suit property on the strength of sale deed and 
respondent No.1 had no right to sell the suit property in favour of 
respondents No.3. The revenue officer was not competent to cancel 
the mutation, entered on the strength of registered sale deed, on the 
ground that provision of Martial Law Regulation had been violated. 
Therefore, the order dated 18.05.1985 with regard to cancellation of 
mutation No.534 is void ab-initio and having no effect upon the 
rights of the petitioner.

Epitome of above discussion is that the instant Civil 
Revision is allowed Impugned judgment and decree dated 
27.05.1993 passed by learned appellate Court is set-aside, whereas, 
the judgment and decree of learned trial Court dated 18.04.1990 is 
maintained and upheld, resultantly suit of the petitioner is decreed 
as prayed for with costs throughout.
