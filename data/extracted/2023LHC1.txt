Through this petition filed under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the 
“Constitution”), the Petitioner has challenged the vires of 
impugned notice dated 07.12.2022 the (“notice”) issued 
in pursuance of order dated 21.10.2022 the (“order”) by 
the Election Commission of Pakistan (the “ECP”).  
2. 
At the start of hearing the case, learned legal 
advisor for the Respondent-ECP objected that the 
Petitioner has not made certain Respondents as party to 
this petition (who filed reference against the Petitioner). 
However, with permission of the Court, learned counsel 
for the Petitioner has incorporated Federation of Pakistan 
through Secretary Law, Islamabad, Barrister Mohsin 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.332 of 2022

Nawaz Ranjha MNA, NA-89, Agha Hassan Baloch, 
MNA, NA-266, Salah Uddin Ayubi, MNA, NA-283, 
Gohar Ali Khan, MNA, NA-103, Syed Rafi Ullah Agha, 
MNA, NA-236, Saad Waseem Sheikh, MNA, NA-137 
and Speaker National Assembly, National Assembly 
Secretariat, Islamabad as the Respondents No.2 to 9 in 
this petition. 
3. 
Senator Barrister Ali Zafar, ASC states that the 
Petitioner is basically aggrieved by the assumption of 
jurisdiction by the “ECP” through issuance of the 
“order” and the “notice” on the complaint of 
Respondents No.3 to 8 and seeks interpretation of Articles 
218(3) and 219 read with Articles 4 and 5 of the 
“Constitution” and Section 8(c) and 9 of the Election Act, 
2017 (the “Act”) in the light of Article 62(f) of the 
“Constitution”. He pointed out that a reference against 
the Petitioner was submitted by the Respondents No.3 to 8 
before the Respondent No.9 who sent the same on 
02.08.2022 (Annex-B, Page-22 of petition) to the “ECP” 
to decide the matter through the “order” resulting into the 
“notice”. Senator Ali Zafar, ASC maintains that the 
pivotal point involved in this case is whether the “ECP” 
can pass any declaration which is not mentioned under 
Article 218(3) of the “Constitution” and only words used 
therein is to “conduct” and “organize” election which is 
further 
specified 
in 
Article 
219(a)(b) 
of 
the 
“Constitution”. He adds that the “Act” was enacted in 
year 2017 and the “ECP”, in terms of Sections 8 and 9 of 
the “Act”, has only power to ensure fair election a but 
power of declaration has nowhere been provided.  
4. 
When confronted to maintainability of this petition 
in the light of judgment passed by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan reported in “ALI ASJAD MALHI Versus 
Ms. Syeda NOSHEEN IFTIKHAR and others” (PLD 2023 
Supreme Court 1) whereby criteria for interference in the 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.332 of 2022   
 
 
 
 
 
   3 
matters of ECP was made by referring the earlier 
judgment “Ejaz Ahmed Sandhu v. Election Commission 
of Pakistan (2018 SCMR 1367) observed that 
“5. 
The Election Commission is a constitutional 
body and unless it is shown that the jurisdiction and 
discretion exercised by it is illegal, mala fide, 
manifestly arbitrary or unjustifiable its working and 
decisions should not be interfered with” 
It becomes plain from the dicta cited above that 
only limited grounds exist for interfering with 
ECP’s decisions, namely, when these involve the 
exercise of illegal, or mala fide, or manifestly 
arbitrary 
or 
unjustifiable 
jurisdiction 
and 
discretion by the ECP. The rationale for this is 
obvious: the ECP is a constitutional body which is 
empowered by Article 218(3) of the Constitution to 
ensure that elections are conducted ‘honestly, 
justly, fairly and in accordance with law, and that 
corrupt practices are guarded against’.  
 
5. 
In reply, Senator Barrister Ali Zafar, ASC has 
relied on the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan passed in Civil Petition No.397 of 2022 dated 
25.11.2022 (2020 SCP 358) titled “Muhammad Faisal 
Vawda Versus Election Commission of Pakistan through 
its Secretary and others” wherein it has been observed 
“that “ECP” has no jurisdiction under Article 218(3) of 
the Constitution read with Section 8(c) or 9(1) of the 
Election Act 2017 to inquire into and decide upon the 
matter of pre-election qualification and disqualification of 
a returned candidate. Therefore, the decision of the ECP 
was without jurisdiction”. He pointed out that this view 
has already been given by this Court in “TARIQ IQBAL 
Versus THE ELECTION COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN 
through its Secretary etc” (PLD 2022 Lahore 607) and 
“SAIMA ASHIQ Versus ELECTION COMMISSION OF 
PAKISTAN etc” (2022 MLD 2018). Senator Barrister Ali 
Zafar, ASC states that in view of judgments referred to 
above, this petition is maintainable.  
6. 
Points raised need consideration.

7. 
Learned counsel for the Respondent-ECP objected 
to maintainability of the petition on the touchstone of 
Articles 62(3) and 222 of the “Constitution” coupled with 
pendency of the “order” challenged by the Petitioner 
before the learned Islamabad High Court, Islamabad. 
8. 
In order to proceed further, this Court has examined 
the judgment whereby the role of the “ECP” was 
discussed in W.P.No.2604 of 2022 dated 21.09.2022, 
titled 
“IMRAN 
AMHAD 
KHAN 
NIAZI 
Versus 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN etc” (2022 LHC 6501) by 
granting interim relief and when this order was challenged 
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Apex 
Court in Constitution Petition No.30 of 2022 dated 
06.12.2022 titled “Election Commission of Pakistan 
through its Secretary, Islamabad Versus Imran Ahmed 
Khan Niazi and others”, observed in paragraph No.2 
which reads as: 
“The learned counsel has pointed out that though 
the order of the Lahore High Court dated 
21.09.2022, the petitioner ECP has additionally 
been prevented from taking adverse action against 
the respondents. That point is insignificant at the 
present stage. Any adverse action by the ECP can 
only follow once it has passed a final order under 
Section 10 of the Act against the respondents. That 
stage is yet to arrive”. 
 
9. 
It is noted that the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in aforesaid order has observed that all the 
Courts can decide the election petition and this has further 
been strengthened in “MUHAMMAD SALEEM BAIG, 
CHAIRMAN 
PAKISTAN 
ELECTRONIC 
MEDIA 
REGULATORY AUTHORITY (PEMRA), ISLAMABAD 
Versus Messrs LABBAIK (PVT.) LIMITED through 
Executive Admin Bol TV, Quetta and others” (PLD 2023 
Supreme Court 27) by holding that “the petitioner must 
face the litigation before the courts of competent 
jurisdiction”.

10. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner put much 
emphasis that before proceeding further, it is necessary to 
frame and formulate constitutional moot points and for 
this purpose, he has referred to judgment of this Court 
cited in “MUHAMMAD UMAIS Versus RAWALPINDI 
CANTONMENT BOARD etc” (PLD 2022 Lahore 148) 
wherein the Court, at paragraph No.12, Page 159, has held 
that before deciding a question of law, it has to formulate 
constitutional moot points if writ is admitted for regular 
hearing. Relevant part of the same is reproduced 
hereunder: 
“12.  After framing of issues on constitutional 
moot points, this Court has narrowed down the law 
points and determined the fundamental rights of the 
Petitioner but while rendering judgment, the 
constitutional petition filed under Article 199 of the 
Constitution, if the writ petition is admitted for 
regular hearing, and after perusing the record from 
the report and parawise comments, the Court has to 
render a decision strictly as per Articles 199 and 
201 of the Constitution. The decision or order could 
be a judgment or an order passed on the 
constitutional petition filed under Article 199 of the 
Constitution but those decisions are made under the 
established law of precedent under Article 201 of 
the Constitution, to have a binding effect and its 
principles have to be followed later. Article 201 of 
the Constitution states that a decision of High 
Court if (i) it decides a question of law or is (ii) 
based upon or (iii) enunciates a principle of law be 
binding on subordinate Courts. In this case, writ 
petition was filed on 21.04.2021 and after hearing 
the parties on 28.04.2021, the Court while 
admitting the writ petition directed the parties to 
file written statement. Thereafter, written statement 
was filed by the Respondents and perused by this 
Court, hence, before proceedings further, the Court 
framed moot points in order to render a judgment 
under Article 201 of the Constitution. It is a settled 
norm that the decision on a question of law can 
only be made if question of law is framed and 
highlighted from the pleadings. In this case the 
Court on 02.06.2021 framed the constitutional moot 
points, mentioned above, in order to render a 
judgment, while keeping in mind the principles of 
law already established by the Superior Court, 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.332 of 2022   
 
 
 
 
 
   6 
relied by both the counsel for the parties, then 
passed its decision on it to be called a decision or a 
judgment. Accordingly, the judgment then passed 
will consists of ratio decidendi, facts, arguments of 
the parties, moot points involved, and stare decisis 
and 
obiter 
dicta. 
The 
Constitution 
clearly 
empowers the Courts in Pakistan to render on these 
parameters regarding the question of law or based 
on question enunciated a principle of law. As every 
judgment of the Supreme Court is binding on all 
Courts under Article 189 of the Constitution, the 
same words are used in Article 201 of the 
Constitution but subject to Article 189 to follow its 
principle for consistency”.  
 
11. 
Admit. Notice to the Respondents for 11.01.2023. 
Learned counsel for the Respondent-ECP accepts notice 
on behalf of Respondent No.1. Whereas, learned law 
officers accepts notice on behalf of newly incorporated 
Respondent No.2.  
12. 
Since the case relates to interpretation of Articles of 
the “Constitution” and certain provisions of the “Act” 
involving infringement of fundamental rights of the 
Petitioner as per Article 10-A, 4 and 5 of the 
“Constitution” therefore, following constitutional moot 
points are hereby framed.  
i. 
Whether 
the 
“ECP” 
can 
pass 
any 
declaration in the light of Article 218 of the 
Constitution and the judgments mentioned 
above, by examining the power of the “ECP” 
in terms of Section 8(c) and 9 of the Act? 
ii. 
Whether the word “declaration” falls under 
the wording “conduct” and “organize” as 
used under Article 218(3) and 219 of the 
“Constitution”? 
iii. 
Whether 
power 
of 
declaration 
has 
specifically been mentioned in the “Act” and 
the Rules framed thereunder in the light of 
judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan?  
 
13. 
A separate notice be also issued to the learned 
Attorney General for Pakistan as well as learned Advocate 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No.332 of 2022

General Punjab in terms of Order XXVII-A of the Code 
of Civil Procedure (V of 1908). 
C.M.No.01 of 2022 
14. 
Dispensation sought for is allowed subject to all 
just and legal exceptions. C.M. stands disposed of. 
C.M.No.02 of 2022 
12. 
Notice for the above date. As the learned Law 
Officer has been heard as per requirement of Article 
199(4) of the “Constitution” in light of the recent 
judgment passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of “FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN 
through Secretary, Ministry of Energy (Power Division), 
Islamabad and others Versus SHAFIQ UL HASSAN and 
others (2020 SCMR 2119) and the interpretation on the 
exercise of jurisdiction of the “ECP” on the issue of 
declaration is required, therefore, in the light of 
observation given by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in “ASLI ASJAD MALHI Versus Ms. Syeda 
NOSHEEN IFTIKHAR and others” (PLD 2023 Supreme 
Court 1) that the Court can interfere in the ECP’s decision 
when these involve the exercise of illegal, or malafide, or 
manifestly arbitrary or unjustifiable jurisdiction, hence, till 
the next date of hearing, no adverse action shall be taken 
against the Petitioner.
