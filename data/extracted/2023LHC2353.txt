Ahmad Ali v. 
Addl. Sessions Judge, etc.  
 
 
                   Date of hearing 
07.04.2023  
 
 
 
Petitioner by:     
Ch. Khurshid Anwar Bhinder,   
 
 
 
Advocate. 
 
Respondents/  
  
State by:-   
Mr. Moeen Ali, Deputy Prosecutor  
 
 
 
General  
 
 
MUHAMMAD WAHEED KHAN, J.- The 
petitioner applied for superdari of vehicle Toyota Corolla 
(Altis) No.LEE/6781, chassis No.ZRE172R-7010054, 
engine No.0311019 (vehicle in question) before the 
learned Magistrate 1st Class, Chiniot, who dismissed the 
same vide order dated 22.06.2022. The petitioner assailed 
the said order by filing criminal revision petition before 
the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Chiniot, which also 
met the same fate vide order dated 02.07.2022 and 
upheld the order of learned Magistrate.  
2. 
Through this petition filed u/s 561-A Cr.P.C. the 
petitioner has impugned both the orders mentioned 
above. 
3. 
Facts of the case are that the vehicle in question 
had been taken into custody by the CIA staff u/s 550 
Cr.P.C. being stolen property. The petitioner filed 
application for superdari before the learned Magistrate 1st 
Class, Chiniot, stating therein that he was legitimate 
owner of the vehicle in question as he had purchased the 

 
 
 
Cr. Misc. No.60827-M of 2022                                                                                    2 
 
 
 
same from one Waqas Ahmad s/o Muhammad Bashir r/o 
District Kotli Azad Kashmir, who was serving as Colonel 
in Pakistan Army and it has wrongly been taken into 
possession by the CIA staff. During the pendency of his 
application, a report was requisitioned from the police by 
the learned Magistrate, same was submitted and the CIA 
police officer Nasarullah ASI-respondent No.3 also 
appeared before the learned Magistrate with the assertion 
that in fact two vehicles of same number are operating 
i.e. one in Chiniot and the second in Kotli Azad Kashmir 
and the vehicle in question is tampered and without 
forensic report, so the application filed by the petitioner 
may not be allowed. So, the learned Magistrate turned 
down his application in the following terms;- 
“No doubt the petitioner has produced relevant 
documents but the same prima facie prove that he is 
owner of vehicle. On the other hand, the vehicle is 
same which was received by first owner Waqas 
Ahmed from company. Thus, it can only be 
evaluated who is rightly entitled to the vehicle when 
allegations of tampering, cut and weld are sort out. 
Thus this is only possible when the vehicle is 
transferred to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore. The concerned Laboratory has capability 
to provide expert opinion about the tampering, cut 
and weld. Thus, until and unless the aforesaid 
report is received, the allegations of police cannot 
be decided out and vehicle cannot be handed over 
to the petitioner. The Incharge CIA is directed to 
transmit immediately the vehicle to the PFSA, 
Lahore for its test and not to misuse the vehicle. In 
case of misuse the penal action will be taken 
against the concerned CIA Incharge Nasar Ullah 
ASI. With these observations, the petition in hand is 
hereby dismissed.” 
 
The petitioner has directed a Criminal Revision petition 
against the aforesaid order dated 22.06.2022 passed by 
the learned Magistrate 1st Class, Chiniot before the 
learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Chiniot, who vide order 
dated 02.07.2022 dismissed the same with the 
observation that the Court cannot restrain the police for 

 
 
 
Cr. Misc. No.60827-M of 2022                                                                                    3 
 
 
 
examining the chassis number about its tampering with 
or refitted from concerned laboratory and in this respect 
order of the learned Magistrate is in accordance with law. 
Hence, this petition. 
4. 
I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner, 
learned Law Officer and perused the available record 
with their assistance. 
5. 
The crux of arguments of learned counsel for the 
petitioner is that in absence of counter claimant, the 
petitioner is eligible to get the vehicle in question on 
superdari, irrespective of the fact that the same has been 
declared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) 
as tampered. In support of his assertion, he has relied 
upon the ratio decidendi laid down by this Court in cases 
of “Mst. AISHA MAI v. EXCISE AND TAXATION OFFICER, 
BAHAWALPUR and 2 others” (2001 YLR 2091), “Haji 
RAB NAWAZ v. THE STATE” (2009 P Cr. L J 945), 
MUHAMMAD SHAHID v. THE STATE (2007 P Cr. L J 
1168) and a judgment rendered by Peshawar High Court 
in case of “MAHBOOB KHAN v. THE STATE” (2003 
YLR 791). In rebuttal, learned Law Officer while 
seeking guidelines issued by the august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in case titled “Government of Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa through Secretary Excise and Taxation 
Department, Civil Secretariat, Peshawar and others v. 
Sarfraz Khan and another” (2020 SCMR 1410), Ch. 
MAQBOOL AHMED v. CUSTOMS, FEDERAL EXCISE 
AND SALES TAX, APPELLATE TRIBUNAL and 3 
others” (2009 SCMR 226) and judgments passed by the 
Peshawar High Court in cases of “Muhammad Zada v. 
The 
state” 
(2021 
YLR 
1415) 
and 
SULTAN 
MUHAMMAD 
v. 
COLLECTOR 
CUSTOMS 
and 
another” (2015 PTD 570) submits that the petitioner is 

 
 
 
Cr. Misc. No.60827-M of 2022                                                                                    4 
 
 
 
not eligible to have custody of vehicle in question having 
a tampered chassis frame.  
6. 
In case of “Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa” 
referred supra, the apex Court has held that section 33 of 
the Provincial Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965 states 
that any alteration effected in the vehicle is required to be 
reported within 14 days to the authority in whose 
jurisdiction the owner resides and the authority is 
required to issue a certificate of registration of the subject 
vehicle to the concerned authority where such alteration 
has to be entered into. The question as to welding and 
refilled old chassis plate of the same vehicle amounts to 
altering of the original chassis number came up for 
consideration. The learned Bench made the following 
observation regarding this situation;- 
vi) “Tampering” of chassis number of the 
 
vehicle, include any alteration of the original 
 
chassis number of the vehicle, whether 
 
manual or  
otherwise OR cutting a piece of 
 
the frame and re-welding another piece 
 
thereon 
OR 
chassis 
number 
filled 
with 
 
welding material and then re-stamped. 
(vii)  ……….. 
(viii) Tampering of chassis number as a result of 
 
an accident of the vehicle could only be a 
 
valid ground, if the same was reported to 
 
and 
confirmed 
by 
the 
Motor 
Vehicle 
 
Authorities under section 33 of the Motor 
 
Vehicle Ordinance, 1965. 
 
……………  
Presenting documentation, relating to the said 
"tampered" vehicle from the Motor Vehicle 
Authority, without specific approval for the 
alteration in the chassis of engine number, as 
envisaged under section 33 of the Motor 
Vehicle Ordinance, 1965 ("Ordinance") would 
be of no legal avail. 
 
Moreover, 
allowing 
a 
vehicle, 
having 
"tampered" 
chassis 
number, 
even 
with 
registration book from the Motor Vehicle 
Authority, would surely offend and abuse the 
provisions of the Act/Ordinance and the Policy 

 
 
 
Cr. Misc. No.60827-M of 2022                                                                                    5 
 
 
 
of the Federal Government reflected in Circular 
No. 10(1)/AS/2004 dated 11.12.2017 read with 
S.R.O. No. 568(1)/2008, dated 11.6.2008." 
 
Similar observation has been rendered in the judgment of 
“Ch. Maqbool Ahmad” referred supra. 
7. 
Since there is no denial of the fact that vehicle in 
question in this case was found to be tampered by the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) and learned 
counsel for the petitioner also did not dispute this factum. 
The photocopy of report dated 15.08.2022 tendered by 
the above said agency is annexed with this petition. On 
going through the contents of the same, I have noticed 
that while giving the result of vehicle in question, the 
said agency has made following observation in its 
report;- 
Details Of Results Based On Test(S) Performed: 
 Chasis number before examination ZRE 172R 7010054 
 Chasis number after examination ?????????????????.  
 The Chasis number was found to be grinded and self 
punched 
 Engine number before examination Q311019 
 Engine Number after examination ?????????????  
 The engine number was found to be grinded and self 
punched 
 
Details of conclusion based on test(s) performed: 
 The chasis number "ZRE 172R-7010054" was found to 
be bogus and genuine chassis number could not be 
restored 
 The engine number "Q311019" was found to be bogus 
and genuine engine number could not be restored. 
 
NOTE: 
 The results in this report relate only to the item(s) as 
received and tested 
 means the number was found to be tampered but 
original number did not appear 
 
8. 
So in the light of above discussion, I am of the 
view that if the petitioner has purchased the vehicle in 
question without taking due care and in compliance with 
the requirements of law, he cannot be claimed to be a 

 
 
 
Cr. Misc. No.60827-M of 2022                                                                                    6 
 
 
 
bona fide purchaser and at the maximum, he can claim 
damages from the person from whom he had purchased 
the same. As far as the judgments referred by learned 
counsel for the petitioner are concerned, I have gone 
through 
the 
same 
and 
noticed 
that 
facts 
and 
circumstances of those cases are different from the case 
in hand. Even otherwise, in case of “Government of 
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa” referred supra originally High 
Court had set aside the seizure order and directed the 
department to hand over the vehicle to the owner but the 
said order was challenged by the government before the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan and vide the above 
said judgment, it was allowed and order of High Court 
was set aside by observing that the owner was not 
entitled to retain or get superdari of the vehicle which has 
been declared as having been with tampered chassis 
number.  
9. 
Under the circumstances, the instant petition being 
devoid of any merits is hereby dismissed.
