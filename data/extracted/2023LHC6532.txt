Agritech Limited    Versus     Federation of Pakistan, etc. 
 
J U D G M E N T 
Date of Hearing: 
31.10.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. 
Sarfraz 
Ahmad 
Cheema, 
Advocate. 
Respondents by: 
Mirza Nasar Ahmad, Addl. Attorney 
General, Pakistan. 
Mr. 
Muhammad 
Anwar 
Khan, 
Assistant Attorney General.  
Mr. Ahmed Pervaiz, Advocate for the 
respondent-FBR. 
       Anwaar Hussain, J.  Through the present petition, under Article 
199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the 
Constitution”), challenge has been laid to the pre-refund audit 
proceedings and the consequent show-cause notice dated 09.06.2023 
issued by the respondent-FBR, with the averments that the same be 
declared illegal, unlawful and violative of the provisions of Section 10 
of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (“the Act”). Prayer has also been made that 
respondent No.3 be directed to refund the excess amount of input tax 
paid by the petitioner amounting to Rs.2,214,825,246/-. 
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
petitioner is a Public Limited Company, registered under the law, and 
is engaged in manufacturing of fertilizers, prominent of which being 
Urea and Granulated Single Super Phosphate (GSSP). It is the case of 
the petitioner that the petitioner pays input tax applicable at 17% 
whereas the output tax is charged, on the goods (fertilizers), at the 
reduced rate of 2% by virtue of Eighth Schedule to the Act and hence, 
the petitioner is entitled to the above referred amount of tax refund for 

2 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
the period of January, 2021 to June, 2022; however, the refund claims 
remained pending for payment with the respondent-FBR despite timely 
filing of the same along with the requisite documents that constrained 
the 
petitioner 
to 
file 
constitutional 
petition, 
bearing 
W.P. 
No.21823/2023, before this Court for the payment of differential 
amount of input tax paid by the petitioner, which was disposed of, vide 
order dated 03.04.2023, with the direction to respondent No.2 to treat 
the said constitutional petition as a representation of the petitioner and 
decide the issue in hand, after providing proper hearing to the 
petitioner, strictly in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act 
read with the Sales Tax Rules, 2006 (“the Rules”), through a speaking 
order, within a period of three weeks from the receipt of certified copy 
of the order.  
3. 
Mr. Sarfraz Ahmad Cheema, Advocate, learned counsel for the 
petitioner submits that an application was submitted on 05.04.2023, 
with respondent No.2 along with the order of this Court dated 
03.04.2023, for the decision in the matter, in accordance with law, and 
particularly by following the provisions of Section 10 of the Act read 
with Chapter V of the Rules, however, respondent No.2 neither decided 
the representation of the petitioner nor issued the refund claim and the 
petitioner was again constrained to file Crl. Org. No.39078/2023 before 
this Court in which notices were issued by this Court but in the 
meanwhile, the respondents had initiated pre-refund audit proceedings 
in terms of Rule 30(3) of the Rules, 2006, which was objected to by the 
petitioner by way of filing objections. Adds that instead of deciding the 
objections, respondent No.3 issued show-cause notice dated 
09.06.2023, which has been impugned through the present petition. 
Further contends that the respondent-FBR has failed to decide the 
refund application of the petitioner within time stipulated in Section 10 
of the Act, which in the first place has been fixed as 45 days and only 
in case of any discrepancy, the same is required to be decided within a 
period of 60-days or within a period of 120-days as contemplated under 
Section 10(3) of the Act that never happened despite direction of this 

3 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
Court dated 03.04.2023. Further adds that filing of contempt petition 
bearing Crl. Org No.39078/2023 has sparked hostility and antagonistic 
approach on the part of the respondent-FBR towards the petitioner, as a 
consequence whereof the respondent-FBR has initiated multiple 
proceedings against the petitioner in order to frustrate the lawful refund 
claims of the petitioner and the impugned show-cause notice is part 
thereof to delay and frustrate the same. Concludes that the manner in 
which the refund application of the petitioner company has been dealt 
with violates the true import of Section 10 of the Act and is also 
violative of the dicta laid down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
the cases reported as “The Collector of Sales Tax, Gujranwala and 
others v. Messrs Super Asia Mohammad Din and sons and others” 
(2017 SCMR 1427) and “Province of Punjab through Conservator of 
Forest, Faisalabad and others v. Javed Iqbal” (2021 SCMR 328).  
4. 
Conversely, Mr. Ahmed Pervaiz, Advocate, learned counsel for 
the respondent-FBR objects to the maintainability of the present 
petition, on the ground that the department has merely initiated pre-
refund audit proceedings and issued show cause notice and at present, 
no adverse order has been passed against the petitioner and hence, the 
petition is pre-mature. Adds that even otherwise, petition is not 
maintainable against a show-cause notice. Places reliance upon case 
reported as “Commissioner of Inland Revenue, Zone-III, Reginal Tax 
Office, Islamabad v. Messrs Pearl Security (Pvt.) Limited” (2022 PTD 
1876) in support of his contentions. On merits, contends that the time 
frame envisaged under the provisions regarding refund in general and 
Section 10 of the Act in particular, are not mandatory in nature as no 
consequences thereof have been contemplated under the law and it 
cannot be interpreted in a manner that after lapse of 45-days or such 
other period, under the Act, the refund claim automatically stands 
approved. Avers that even otherwise, the case of the petitioner does not 
fall under Section 10(1) as the supplies of the petitioner are neither zero 
rated nor exports made during the relevant tax period, rather, the case 
of the petitioner is covered under the first proviso of Section 10(1) of 

4 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
the Act since admittedly the supplies are on reduced rate, which brings 
the case under the clutches of the Rules framed thereunder where no 
such time period of 45-days has been contemplated by the legislature.  
5. 
Learned Additional Attorney General while responding in terms 
of notice issued by this Court, under Order XXVII-A of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908, also submits that the case of the petitioner does 
not fall under Section 10(1) of the Act and is to be dealt with by first 
proviso thereunder and no time frame is given under the Act for 
deciding the claim of those taxpayers who do not fall under the zero-
rated and within the purview of Section 10(1) of the Act, however, 
states that the needful is required to be done expeditiously, within a 
reasonable time. He further contends that the law envisages the 
consequences of the delay occurring in deciding the refund claims of 
the taxpayers like the petitioner and a taxpayer whose claim is not 
timely decided is to be conferred benefit envisaged under Section 67 of 
the Act. 
6. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the 
manner in which the department has dealt with the matter makes the 
mandatory provisions of Section 10 in general and sub-Sections (1) and 
(3) thereof in particular redundant, which is not permissible under the 
law. Responding to the second objection on merits of the case submits 
that even though the supplies of the petitioner do not fall under zero-
rated local supplies or export, however, the same fall under the Third 
Category which pertains to supplies on the reduced rates, and the 
proviso to Section 10(1) of the Act is being misinterpreted inasmuch as 
the said proviso benefits the petitioner enabling the petitioner to carry 
forward the claim to the following month, which is not possible as the 
petitioner is charging output tax on reduced rate and refund claim of 
the petitioner merits expeditious decision. Concludes that a 
constitutional petition is maintainable against a show-cause notices 
where important question of law is required to be interpreted and/or the 
department has acted with illegality and places reliance on cases

W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
reported as “Messrs Karachi Golf Club (Private) Limited through 
Manager Accounts and Finance and others v. Province of Sindh 
through Director Sindh Revenue Board and others” (2021 PTD 558), 
“Commissioner of Income Tax v. Messrs Eli Lilly Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd.” 
(2009 SCMR 1279) and “Commissioner Income Tax Companies II and 
another v. Hamdard Dawakhana (waqf) Karachi” (PLD 1992 SC 847).  
7. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
8. 
The following legal questions arise out of the factual layout of 
the case and call for the opinion of this Court: 
i) 
What is the scope of Section 10 of the Act and 
whether the elapse of time stipulated thereunder ipso 
facto renders the refund claim admissible and due?  
ii) 
What are the consequences of delay in deciding the 
refund claim?  
iii) 
Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case 
and the scope of Section 10 of the Act, the present 
petition having been filed against a show-cause 
notice issued, premised on pre-refund audit 
proceedings against the petitioner, is maintainable? 
9. 
Before answering the above formulated questions, it would be 
advantageous to reproduce Section 10 of the Act that reads as under: 
“10. Refund of input tax.– (1) If the input tax paid by a 
registered person on taxable purchases made during a tax period 
exceeds the output tax on account of zero rated local supplies or 
export made during that tax period, the excess amount of input 
tax shall be refunded to the registered person not later than forty-
five days of filing of refund claim in such manner and subject to 
such conditions as the Board may, by notification in the official 
Gazette specify:  
 
Provided that in case of excess input tax against supplies 
other than zero-rated or exports, such excess input tax may be 
carried forward to the next tax period, along with the input tax 
as is not adjustable in terms of sub-section (1) of section 8B, and 
shall be treated as input tax for that period and the Board may, 
subject to such conditions and restrictions as it may impose, by 
notification in the official Gazette, prescribe the procedure for 
refund of such excess input tax. 
 
 Provided further that the Board may, from such date and 
subject to such conditions and restrictions as it may impose, by 

6 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
notification in the official Gazette, direct that refund of input tax 
against exports shall be paid at the fixed rates and in the manner 
as notified in such notification. 
(2) If a registered person is liable to pay any tax, default surcharge 
or penalty payable under any law administered by the Board, the 
refund of input tax shall be made after adjustment of unpaid 
outstanding amount of tax or, as the case may, default surcharge 
and penalty.  
 (3) Where there is reason to believe that a person has claimed 
input tax credit or refund which was not admissible to him, the 
proceedings against him shall be completed within sixty days. 
For the purposes of enquiry or audit or investigation regarding 
admissibility of the refund claim, the period of sixty days may be 
extended up to one hundred and twenty days by an officer not 
below the rank of an Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue 
and the Board may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend 
the aforesaid period which shall in no case exceed nine 
months.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
For the purpose of carrying out the mandate of Section 10 of the Act, it 
is Chapter V of the Rules, which have been formulated. The relevant 
rules are reproduced as under:

separate electronic data shall be required. The amount specified in 
column 29 of the return, as prescribed in the form STR-7, shall be 
considered as amount claimed for the purposes of claim under 
section 10 of the Act, once the return has been submitted along 
with all prescribed annexures thereof:  
 
Provided that, in case of claims arising from zero-rated 
supplies including exports, the claimant shall be able to submit his 
return without Annex-H and the same may be filed separately at 
any time but not later than one hundred and twenty days of 
submission of the return without Annex-H. The date of 
submission of Annex-H shall be considered as the date of filing of 
refund claim. In other cases of refund, the date of submission of 
form STR-7A shall be considered as date of submission of 
refund claim and the same shall be filed within one hundred 
and twenty days of submission of relevant return:  
      ..... 
(2) The registered person claiming refund in the aforesaid manner 
shall maintain and keep all the paper documents relating to the

7 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
concerned Regional Tax Office or Large Taxpayers' Unit. The 
same shall be presented to the said offices if so required by the 
officer-in-charge for processing of the refund claim or post-
refund scrutiny. 
29. Risk management system (RMS).−(1) After submission of 
refund claim, in the aforesaid manner, the same shall be processed

amount as well as the amount not validated along-with the 
objections raised by the system.  
(2) The processing officer shall forward the claim file along-with

(3) Where the Processing Officer or the officer-in-charge is of 
the opinion that any further inquiry or audit is required in 
respect of amount not cleared by the STARR channel or for any 
other reason to establish genuineness and admissibility of the 
claim, he may make or cause to be made such inquiry or audit as 
deemed appropriate, after seeking approval from the concerned

which the claim has been filed and shall not include any excess 
input tax declared prior to the said period.  
(2)  
The registered person, after submission of return in which

(2) of section 8B of the Act, shall be sanctioned as found 
admissible after a departmental audit of records maintained by 
the registered person and after a certificate is recorded by the 
[Inland Revenue officers] auditing the records that actual value 
addition during the period involved was not found sufficient to 
require a net payment of tax for the reasons mentioned in the 
audit report:  
(Emphasis supplied) 
10. 
Section 10(1) of the Act relates to refund claim of taxpayers who 
fall under the category of zero-rated local supplies or the exports. The 
claim of such taxpayers is to be decided in 45 days. However, if the 
respondent-FBR has reason to believe that the refund claim was not 
admissible, then audit and/or inquiry proceedings can be initiated and 
are to be concluded within sixty days that can be extended up to one 
hundred and twenty days by the Additional Commissioner and by the 
Board up to nine months. Meaning thereby that pre-refund audit 

9 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
proceedings can be initiated even in case of taxpayers of all categories 
whether falling under Section 10(1) and/or the first proviso thereof. 
However, the time frame after initiation of the audit proceeding is to be 
regulated in terms of Section 10(3). The initial time period within 
which refund claim of taxpayers falling under proviso to Section 10(1) 
of the Act is to be decided is not provided, however, it has to be carried 
out within reasonable time. 
11. 
Insofar as the first legal question formulated hereinabove is 
concerned, it is evident from bare reading that Section 10(1) of the Act 
deals with the refund claim of zero-rated local supplies and/or the 
exports. Proviso to Section 10(1) deals with category of cases other 
than those provided under Section 10(1). It is also imperative to note 
that there is no second opinion to the legal position that the case of the 
petitioner does not fall within the purview of Section 10(1) of the Act, 
rather, the same is covered by the proviso to Section 10(1). While the 
time period envisaged under Section 10(1) pertains to the excess input 
tax adjustment emanating out of zero-rated local supplies or exports, 
proviso to Section 10(1), deals with claim of the other taxpayers. It is 
the case of the petitioner that in any claim for refund under the Act, 
once no objection is raised by the respondent-FBR, within the 
stipulated time period provided under the law (i.e., Section 10 of the 
Act), the claim of the claimant/tax-payer (the petitioner in the instant 
case) crystalizes into verified and approved claim and cannot be 
retracted from or denied subsequently by the department and only post 
refund audit proceedings can be initiated. By this, the petitioner wants 
this Court to construe Section 10 as a self-containing and executory 
provision and failure to object to the claim of the petitioner within the 
stipulated time to operate as a deeming provision. Argument is 
misconceived to say the least. Section 10(3) of the Act empowers the 
respondent-FBR to initiate and carry out enquiry, audit and/or 
investigation into any claim for input tax credit or refund in cases 
where the tax authorities have reason to believe that the claim for input 
tax credit or refund is not admissible to the claimant. It will be 

10 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
imperative to mention that the Rules have been promulgated to actualize 
and operationalize the provisions of law contained in Section 10 of the 
Act and Chapter V contains the relevant provisions. This in itself 
connotes that Section 10 is not a self-containing and self-executory 
provision rather the admissibility of the refund claim is required to be 
determined before approving the same. It is further fortified by the words 
used in Section 10(1) i.e., “in such manner and subject to such conditions 
as the Board may, by notification in the official Gazette specify”, shows 
that the provision is not self-executory rather the same is to be actualized 
in such manner and subject to such conditions as the Board may specify.   
12. 
This brings the Court to examine the point as to whether the 
departmental functionaries can sit over the rights of taxpayers [falling 
under first proviso to Section 10(1)] for indefinite period firstly by their 
inactions and subsequently by initiating pre-refund audit proceedings to 
determine the admissibility of the claim and not concluding the same 
within reasonable time and what are consequences of delay in deciding 
the tax refund claim. It is admitted feature of the case that the petitioner 
cannot carry forward the input tax refund to the next tax period as the 
petitioner is charging the output tax at a reduced rate. Hence, refund claim 
of the petitioner merits expeditious decision. Moreover, it is evident that 
the legislature has provided a specific time-period under Section 10(3) of 
the Act which is sixty (60) days extendable to one hundred and twenty 
(120) days by an officer not below the rank of Additional Commissioner 
and thereafter, extendable to a maximum period of nine (9) months by the 
Board by setting out the reasons in writing as to the extension of time 
period to conclude pre-audit proceedings. Nothing has been stated as to 
whether such extension was obtained in the present case and if the same 
has not been sought, such a practice on the part of the department is 
deprecated as this clearly amounts to blatant, if not wilful, disregard for 
the legislative and statutory ordains. This, on the one hand, amounts to 
depriving the taxpayers form their money and, on the other hand,  
amounts  to  unjust   enrichment   of   the  State,  albeit   temporarily,  and  

11 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
concomitant unjust impoverishment of the taxpayers. Therefore, it is 
imperative for the respondent-FBR to ensure that all the proceedings to 
determine the admissibility of the tax refund envisaged in terms of 
Section 10(3) of the Act are not only initiated promptly but also run 
through within the stipulated time in order to nurture confidence of the 
taxpayers and citizens in the fairness on the taxing system of the State. 
Question arises as to what are the consequences of the delay in 
allowing the tax-refund whether falling under Section 10(1) or the first 
proviso thereto. In this regard, learned Additional Attorney General has 
referred to Section 67 of the Act, which is reproduced as under: 
“Delayed Refund.– Where a refund due under section 10 is 
not made within the time specified in section 10 from the date 
of filling of refund claim, there shall be paid to the claimant 
in addition to the amount of refund due to him, a further sum 
equal to KIBOR per annum of the amount of refund due, from 
the date following the expiry of the time specified as 
aforesaid, to the day preceding the day of payment of refund:  
Provided that where there is reason to believe that a person 
has claimed the refund which is not admissible to him, the 
provision regarding the payment of such additional amount 
shall not apply till the investigation of the claim is completed 
and the claim is either accepted or rejected.  
Provided further that where a refund due in the consequence 
of any order passed under section 66 is not made within forty 
five days of date of such order, there shall be paid to the 
claimant in addition to the amount of the refund due to him, a 
further sum equal to KIBOR per annum of the amount of 
refund, due from the date of the refund order.” 
 
 
 
 
 
        (Emphasis supplied) 
Perusal of Section 67 indicates that while an additional sum equal to 
KIBOR per annum has been provided on the delayed refund, the same 
is also circumscribed by the first proviso thereto that where there is 
“reason to believe” that a person has claimed the refund which is not 
admissible to him, the penal consequences under Section 67 would not 
come into play till the investigation of the claim is completed and the 
claim is either accepted or rejected. This further accentuates and 
explicates the legislative intention that the refund claim on the lapse of 
period provided under Section 10 would ipso facto not crystalize into 

12 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
undisputed and payable as there is no express deeming provision to this 
extent and the department is vested with the power to determine the 
admissibility or otherwise of the claim.  
13. 
As a matter of fact, there is no consequence for the non-
adherence to the time-limit provided for conclusion of pre-refund audit 
proceedings under Section 10(3) have been provided which hands out a 
tool to the officials of the respondent-FBR to delay the rights of the tax 
payers. As a result, the respondent-FBR and its officials may continue 
to linger on and protract the pre-audit proceedings for unlimited and 
unrestricted time period leaving the tax payers not only in limbo but 
also depriving the taxpayer of his property in violation of the Article 23 
and 24 of the Constitution. It is also noted that while Section 11 and 
other enabling provisions of law in vogue provide for the additional tax 
and/or penalty for non-payment and/or short payment of tax by the tax 
payers, Section 67 obligates that failure to make payment within the 
time period provided under Section 10 would entitle the taxpayer to an 
additional sum equal to KIBOR on so much of the amount of refund 
which is not paid within the time stipulated. However, the first proviso 
to Section 67, as spelled out above, is a limiting proviso which eclipses 
the applicability of Section 67 till the proceedings (pre-refund audit) as 
to admissibility of the refund is accepted or rejected and thus takes 
back to the significance of Section 10(3) and the time-limit provided 
therein.  
14. 
Insofar as the maintainability of the present petition is 
concerned, it is the case of the petitioner that the entire process is 
automated and once the application for refund was filed, the necessary 
validation takes place every week and reports are generated by the 
system and nothing is hidden from the department and therefore, the 
department is obligated to conclude the same within stipulated period 
of time and in case, at any subsequent stage, it transpires that some 
wrong doing has been committed by the refund claimant  (the petitioner 
in the present case), post-refund audit proceedings can be initiated. 

13 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
Perusal of the record reveals that the claim of the petitioner was routed 
through the Sales Tax Automated Refund Repository Channel 
(“STARR channel”) based upon its parameters for the purpose of 
cross-matching the data provided with the one contained in the system 
and the analysis report highlighted certain discrepancies/objections. 
Through letter dated 20.04.2023, the petitioner was intimated about the 
analysis and the discrepancies/objections in the following terms: 
“It is crystal clear from the above-mentioned table that there is 
a difference value of sales declared in sales tax & federal 
excise returns and value of sales declared in financial 
accounts. Hence these areas will be scrutinized in pre-refund 
audit inquiry under Rule 30(3) of Sales Tax Rules 2006.  
In view of the above, it is necessary that pre-refund audit be 
initiated under Rule 30(3) of Sales Tax Rules 2006. The crux of 
the matter is that the output tax on sales of the company is 
subject to reduced rate so the supply of fertilizers thereof is to be 
taxed at reduced sale tax rate. The main reasons for arising of 
refund of the registered person is that, main input constituents 
of finished products include Sui Gas supplied by SNGPL, 
Chemicals, high speed diesel, packing material and other basic 
raw materials etc which are subject to standard rate of sales 
tax except sui gas which is on reduced rate of sales tax 
resulting a sale tax refund 2,214,825,246/- related to tax 
periods from January, 2021 to June, 2022. In order to 
determine the veracity of the claim of the RP, pre-refund audit 
is warranted for the period mentioned supra.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
Rule 30(3) of the Rules clearly empowers the Processing Officer or 
Officer-In-charge to issue show cause notice if it is found that further 
inquiry or audit is required in respect of the amount not cleared by the 
STARR Channel that is precisely the position in the instant case. 
Hence, the impugned show-cause notice was rightly issued. Moreover, 
perusal of the above mentioned provisions of the Act and the Rules 
made thereunder indicates that once a refund claim is received by the 
department, depending upon the status of the taxpayer as to whether the 
same falls under zero-rated local supplies etc., or otherwise, the same is 
to be processed in accordance with the procedure envisaged under the 
provisions of the Rules in general and Rules 28 to 34 in particular, 
through one of the three particular computerized channels. It is worth 

14 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
mentioning that both sides admit that the case of the petitioner falls 
under the STARR Channel, in terms of Rule 30 reproduced 
hereinabove. The petitioner has filed the refund claims and admittedly, 
the petitioner does not fall under zero-rated category or part of the 
export-oriented industry and its case does not fall under Section 10(1) 
of the Act, therefore period of 45 days envisaged thereunder is not 
applicable as it is first proviso to Section 10(1) of the Act that caters for 
all other categories including the petitioner. In case of the petitioner it 
is procedure under Rule 30 read with Rule 34 quoted hereinabove that 
deal with the process, which is to be traversed through for the refund of 
the excess input tax under the Rules and once such proceedings are 
initiated Section 10(3) comes into play.  
15. 
It has been contended with vehemence that the petition is 
maintainable in cases involving important question regarding 
interpretation of law and where statutory functionary acted in an 
oppressive manner. In the most recent judgment, reported as 
Commissioner IR v. Jahangir Khan Tareen (2022 SCMR 92), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under: 
“10……..Seemingly, the show cause-notice was issued 
after 
fulfilling 
and 
complying 
with 
requisite 
formalities, even so, if the respondent no. 1 had any 
doubts in mind, the issue of jurisdiction or alleged non-
existence of delegated powers should have been raised 
first before Additional Commissioner IR, Large 
Taxpayer Unit rather than challenging show cause 
notice in the writ jurisdiction. 
 11. A show cause notice is delivered to a person by an 
authority in order to get the reply back with a 
reasonable cause as to why a particular action should 
not be taken against him with regard to the defaulting 
act. By and large, it is well defined and well-structured 
process to provide the alleged defaulter with a fair 
chance to respond the allegation and explain his 
position within reasonable timeframe. Even in case of 
an adverse order, the remedies are provided under the 
tax laws with different hierarchy and chain of 
command. The court may take up writs to challenge the 
show cause notice if it is found to be barred by law or 

15 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
abuse of process of the court. The abuse of process is 
the use of legal process for an improper purpose 
incompatible with the lawful function of the process by 
one with an ulterior motive.” 
The case law relied upon by the petitioner side as to the maintainability 
of the petition is distinguishable and not applicable to the case of the 
petitioner. It is settled law which has been re-affirmed and reiterated by 
the Supreme Court in case of Commissioner IR, supra that the show-
cause notice is an opportunity to a person to explain a particular 
position, which in itself, is actualization of the principle of audi alterm 
partem lying on the larger spectrum of principles of natural justice. 
Constitutional petition against a show-cause notice can be filed only if 
the same is barred by law or amounts to abuse of process of the Court. 
As discussed above, in the present case, the show-cause notice issued 
to the petitioner is not barred by law rather the provisions of law 
provide for the pre-refund audit if the department has reasons to believe 
that claim of input tax credit or refund is not admissible. The term 
“reason to believe” has been repetitively interpreted by the Superior 
Courts as something on a higher pedestal than mere suspicion and/or 
allegations that is tangible to trigger a prudent mind to develop reasons 
in his mind on a tentative pedestal fulfils the test of “reason to believe”. 
This takes this Court to the impugned show cause notice which spells 
out the issues the explanation and/or reply whereupon has been sought 
from the petitioner to explain its position. The issues highlighted in 
show-cause notice dated 09.06.2023 read as under: 
 
“6. 
… 
A. Summary of Sales and Purchases with analysis:  
The registered person declared the total supplies at 
Rs.17,306,409,666/- against the total purchases at 
Rs.33,790,195,870/- there is no nexus with the excessive 
declaration of the purchases at Rs.16,483,786,204/- (in 
percentage 95%) for the tax periods under consideration. 
Refund in respect of goods supplied shall be paid to the 
extent of the input tax claimed on purchases that are 
actually consumed in such goods as supplied for 
claiming of sales tax refund under section 7 of Sales Tax 
Act, 1990. … 

16 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
7. Following sales tax discrepancies/observations 
were found under the Sales Tax Act, 1990: 
i. Inadmissible input tax claimed due to violation of 
section 8: 
The registered person claimed inadmissible input tax at 
Rs.636,334,472/- in tune of sales tax refund claimed 
against the goods and services not related to the taxable 
supplies made by the registered person in terms of section 
8 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 in its monthly sales tax 
returns for the tax periods January, 2021 to June, 2022. 
Even, the registered person has also failed to verify the 
admissibility of input tax claimed in respect of 
verification of payment proofs as required under section 
73 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990. The registered person 
claimed inadmissible input tax at Rs.636,334,472/- under 
the Sales Tax Act, 1990. Detail of inadmissible input tax 
is attached at Annex-A. 
ii. Inadmissible input tax claimed on closing balances 
as on 30.06.2022 of raw materials as per consumption 
sheet filed with sales tax refund claims: 
 
…… 
iii. Inadmissible input tax claimed on closing balances 
as on 30.06.2022 of Work-in-Process and Finished 
Goods: 
 
…… 
iv. Suppression of Supply (Opening stock difference 
between Income Tax Return and consumption sheet 
filed for claiming of sales tax refund: 
 
…… 
v. Excessive claimed of sales tax refund based on 
negative value addition.  
 
…… 
8. Therefore, the registered person is called upon to 
explain, as to why sales tax at Rs.2,594,839,002/-, further 
tax at Rs.48,044,298/- along with default surcharge (to be 
calculated at the time of recovery) and penalties at 
Rs.132,144,165/- under sections 34(1)(a) and 33(5) 
respectively may not be recovered or the refund 
equivalent to that amount may not be rejected under 
section 11(2) and 11(4) of the Sales Tax Act, 1990. The 
registered person is, therefore, charged with the violation 
of the provisions of sections 3, 3(1A), 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 22, 
23, 26 and 73 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 and read with 
Rule 33 titled "Extent of payment of refund claim", Rule 
34 titled "Refund of excess input tax not relating to zero-
rated supplies" and Rule 37 titled "Action on inadmissible 
claims" of Chapter-V titled “Refund” of the Sales Tax 
Rules, 2006 notified by SRO 555(1)/2006 dated 5th June, 

17 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
2006 and Rule 25(2) of Chapter-IV titled “Apportionment 
of Input Tax” of the Sales Tax Rules, 2006 notified by 
SRO 555(I)/2006 dated 5th June, 2006.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
The above quoted operative part of the impugned show-cause notice 
reveals that the same has been issued on the basis of pre-refund audit 
proceedings and the petitioner has been given an opportunity to 
explain its position. The petitioner is vested with the right to rebut the 
said issues and the same certainly cannot be ironed out by this Court in 
the constitutional jurisdiction. This Court would stop short of going 
into the detail and/or merits of the issues lest it may prejudice the case 
of any of the parties.  
16. 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that; 
i) 
Section 10 of the Act is not a self-containing and self-
executory provision rather the admissibility of the tax 
refund claim is required to be determined in a case where 
there is reason to believe that the refund claim is not 
admissible; 
ii) 
the respondent-FBR and its officials cannot sit over the 
rights of the taxpayers in relation to the tax refund claims 
for indefinite period and must conclude the pre-refund 
audit proceedings by strictly following the mandate of 
Section 10(3) of the Act; 
iii) 
in view of the facts and circumstances of the present case 
and the scope of first proviso to Section 10(1) of the Act, 
the present petition is misconceived and pre-mature 
inasmuch as the impugned show-cause notice issued by 
the department has been premised on the pre-refund audit 
proceedings and no adverse order has been passed against 
the petitioner; 
iv) 
the respondent-FBR is directed to proceed with the 
present matter, strictly in accordance with law, keeping in 
view the mandate of Section 10(3) of the Act and if in the 

18 
W.P. No.41067/2023 
 
 
instant case, there has been no approval obtained from the 
Board for the conclusion of pre-audit proceedings within 
nine (09) months, ex-post facto approval must be obtained, 
before proceeding further;  
v) 
Section 67 of the Act is only applicable and the additional 
amount is payable to the taxpayer when the refund is held 
due and is not made within the time specified in Section 10 
of the Act but the said provision is to be applicable after the 
investigation of the claim, or so much of the claim as, is 
accepted and for the said purpose mandate of Section 10(3) 
is to be strictly adhered to; and 
vi) 
non-adherence by the respondent-FBR to the time-limit 
envisaged under Section 10(3) of the Act in concluding the 
refund claims amounts to concomitant violation of the 
fundamental rights of the tax-payers guaranteed under 
Articles 23 and 24 of the Constitution. No consequences of 
such non-adherence have been envisaged under the Act. 
This aspect of the matter is a policy issue and requires 
legislation, which is for the Federal Government to examine 
on priority basis. Therefore, the Federal Government is 
directed to consider the possibility of initiating necessary 
legislation on the subject by providing the consequences of 
non-adherence to the provision of Section 10(3) so that the 
rights of the tax payers can be safeguarded.
