==================================== 
 
MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J:- Muhammad Ammar 
Shafi, Mateen Bilal and Muhammad Burhan, accused/appellants 
faced trial before learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore in case 
FIR No.311, dated 14.06.2018 under sections 302/34 PPC (offence 
under Sections 337-F(i)/420/468 and 471 PPC were added during 
investigation) registered at Police Station Millat Park, Lahore and 
on conclusion of trial 
vide 
judgment dated 24.04.2024 
accused/appellants were convicted under section 316 PPC read with 
Section 34 PPC and sentenced to diyat of Rs.19,35,594/-, to be paid 
by all the accused/appellants jointly and in lump-sum to the legal 
heirs of Rashid Ali, deceased and simple imprisonment for five 
years each. However, neither charge under Sections 337-
F(i)/420/468/471 PPC was framed against the appellants nor any 
conviction was handed down by the learned trial Court for the said 
offences. Criminal Appeal No.26878 of 2024 has been filed by 
accused/appellants against their above conviction and sentence, 

2 
Crl. Appeal No. 26878 of 2024 &  
Crl. Revision No. 32182 of 2024. 
 
whereas, Criminal Revision No.32182 of 2024 has been brought by 
the complainant seeking enhancement of sentence of accused/ 
appellants; both these matters are being decided by this single 
judgment. 
Pending trial, an application filed by Mateen Bilal, appellant 
No.2 for declaring him “juvenile offender” was allowed, however, 
his prayer for holding separate trial was declined which was 
pursuant to section 12(2) of Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018. 
 
2. 
As per complaint (Ex.PB) & FIR (Ex.PA) Wajid Hussain 
complainant (PW-3) was working at Ghousia Milk Shop, Nadeem 
Shaheed Road, Samanabad. On 14.06.2018 in wee hours of 
morning at about 05:45 a.m., his brother, namely Rashid Ali son of 
Shah Muhammad caste Gujjar resident of Bastami Road was 
coming from his residence towards Ghousia Milk Shop, when 
unknown accused persons sitting in an ambush at Shahab Chowk 
suddenly attacked his brother Rashid Ali and raised lalkara that 
today he would not be spared. Rashid Ali by running arrived in 
front of shop and called the complainant to rescue him from the 
accused persons. Complainant (PW-3) and his nephew, Zahid 
Maqbool (PW-4) came out from the shop. The said accused persons 
started beating Rashid Ali; they tried to save him but he became 
unconscious and fell down on the ground. In the meanwhile, 
Ahmad Khan son of Abdullah resident of Sabzi Mandi, Lahore 
(given up PW) also arrived at the spot. On seeing brother of the 
deceased as unconscious and fallen on the ground, accused persons 
fled away from the spot on motorcycle. It was claimed that accused 
persons could be identified if come across again. They shifted 
Rashid Ali to nearby Hospital Samanabad through Rescue Service 
1122 where doctor verified his death.  
3. 
Matter was reported to the police by the complainant through 
written application on arrival of Wafa Ali T/SI PW-9 at Govt. 
Hospital Samanabad, Lahore Thereafter, Ghulam Ali, Sub-
Inspector (PW-12) investigating officer reached said Hospital on 

3 
Crl. Appeal No. 26878 of 2024 &  
Crl. Revision No. 32182 of 2024. 
 
the same day, examined the dead body of Rashid Ali, deceased, 
prepared injury statement (Exh.PN) and inquest report (Exh.PO). 
He also drafted application for post mortem examination (Exh.PP) 
and sent the same to dead house for autopsy, prepared rough site 
plan of the place of occurrence (Exh.PR), recorded statements of 
witnesses u/s 161 Cr.P.C., inspected CCTV video, got it secured in 
a CD (P-1) from the office of Safe City Project vide memo 
(Exh.PE), recorded supplementary statement of the complainant. 
On 09.10.2018 Ashiq Hussain SI (PW-13) arrested the accused/ 
appellants, produced them before Judicial Magistrate for physical 
remand. On 12.10.2018 accused/appellant Ammar Shafi led to the 
recovery of motorcycle Honda CD-70 bearing registration No. 
LEY-8922 (P-4) along with two number plates bearing registration 
No. LEK/1624/17 (P-3/1-2). After completion of investigation, he 
submitted report under Section 173 Cr.P.C, the accused were 
charge sheeted to which they pleaded not guilty, whereupon, 
prosecution produced, as many as, fourteen PWs including eye 
witnesses, namely, Wajid Hussain complainant (PW-3) and Zahid 
Maqbool (PW-4) & one witness was recorded as CW-1. After close 
of prosecution evidence, the accused/appellant were examined 
under Section 342 Cr.P.C. and while responding to a question that 
why this case is against them and why PWs deposed against them? 
have stated as under:  
“The instant case was registered against unknown persons but the 
police urged and investigate the complainant (sic), just to show their 
efficiency, to involve me and my co-accused in this case by 
nominating us through his supplementary statement which he did just 
on direction of police. We have no concern with the instant 
occurrence. Police officials and the complainant nominated us while 
presuming us as the accused persons just to complete untraced cases. 
Said facts coupled with the snaps and CD presented by prosecution 
also prove that the occurrence was not committed by us. The 
witnesses of the case were managed by the concerned police officer to 
complete the file of untraced case.”  
The accused/appellants did not appear as their own witness in terms 
of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C., however, produced documents (Mark-A to 
Mark-D) in their evidence and the trial ended in the terms as detailed 
above.

Crl. Appeal No. 26878 of 2024 &  
Crl. Revision No. 32182 of 2024. 
 
4.      
Heard. Record perused.  
5.         The complaint through which crime was reported does not 
bear any time of reporting and it was also not taken care of by the 
police because Wafa Ali T/SI did not mention the time of receiving 
such complaint. Place of receiving complaint was also disputed in this 
case. Wafa Ali T/SI PW-9 claimed receiving of complaint at 
Government Hospital Samanabad, whereas accompanying constable 
Muhammad Amin PW-14 deposed receiving of such complaint at first 
roundabout of Samanabad. Such facts created a shadow of doubt on 
prosecution case from the very inception which in turn doubts 
presence of witnesses at the time of alleged occurrence, particularly 
when the dead body was received in the mortuary after three hours at 
8:45 a.m. but the police papers were given to the doctor with a further 
delay of more than four hours at 1:00 p.m. Yet neither the name of 
complainant PW-3 nor of Zahid Maqbool, PW-4 is mentioned in 
inquest report or the postmortem report. Therefore, transportation of 
deceased to the hospital by the PWs through Rescue Service 1122 
became an answered situation. PW-12 investigating officer also 
conceded that he did not record the statement of any member of 
Rescue Service 1122 about this fact. He further conceded that no 
CDRs of the witnesses were obtained by him in order to verify their 
presence at the place of occurrence at the relevant time. Thus, 
apparently it was an unseen occurrence. 
 
6.  
In a criminal case, first and foremost question of utmost 
importance is the identity of the assailants/accused involved in the 
commission of the occurrence. While dealing with the case of 
unknown accused, care and caution must be taken in ensuring that an 
unknown accused is correctly identified and there must be very bleak 
chances of any misidentification of the culprit, who is being identified 
in the process either through test identification parade as held in a case 
reported as „Mian Sohail Ahmed Vs State‟ (2019 SCMR 956), or 
through any other means, but surprisingly in this case even no 
identification parade was opted to be conducted rather the 

5 
Crl. Appeal No. 26878 of 2024 &  
Crl. Revision No. 32182 of 2024. 
 
identification was rested on supplementary statement and pictures/CD 
obtained from the office of Safe City Project.  
7.  
Ocular account was furnished by Wajid Hussain complainant 
(PW-3) and Zahid Maqbool (PW-4). It is in the evidence that Zahid 
Maqbool (PW-4) was resident of Gulabpura Gujranwala Cantt, 
whereas, the occurrence took place at Samanabad, Lahore about 100-
kilometers away from his house. In his statement before the Court, he 
has failed to advance any reason of his presence at the place of 
occurrence in the wee hours of morning, as such he is a chance 
witness and his testimony cannot be relied upon.  
          While lodging the FIR, Wajid Hussain complainant (PW-3) has 
not mentioned the features of the unknown accused persons who had 
allegedly committed the occurrence though he claimed that the 
accused could be identified on seeing again. However, while 
submitting his application before the police in the form of his 
supplementary version (Exh.PF), the complainant stated that he was 
informed by the police about the presence of the accused persons on 
05.09.2018 before learned Addl. Sessions Judge and when the 
complainant party reached, accused persons escaped from there. In the 
aforementioned statement, the complainant not only improved his 
version by stating himself to be the injured of occurrence but also 
admitted the identification of the accused persons on the information 
of the police. Relevant part of his statement recorded in (Exh.PF) is 
hereby reproduced for ready reference: -

In the aforementioned version which was submitted by the 
complainant after about three months of the occurrence, the 
complainant has not only made dishonest improvement regarding his 
injury but the said statement was also self-contradictory because the 
complainant himself stated that on seeing the complainant party the 
accused/appellants fled away from the spot however, on second call of 
the Court they appeared before the Court and the complainant party 
identified them. It is not appealable to a prudent mind that had the 
accused fled away from the spot on seeing the complainant party then 
they would have re-appeared in order to make them fully identified by 
the complainant party and to create evidence against them. In support 
of acclaimed version, neither the prosecution opted to produce copy of 
bail application of the accused/appellants nor the order sheet of the 
Court to show attendance of accused/appellants and the complainant 
on 05.09.2018. Under the circumstances, it is apparent that 
complainant had neither seen the accused/appellants in the Court nor 
at the place of occurrence; therefore, his testimony is under serious 
clouds of doubt which cannot be relied upon.  
 
 
8.  
It is further noteworthy that the alleged eye witnesses 
manifested unnatural conduct at the place of occurrence. According to 
the prosecution case, the complainant party was comprising of four 
persons including the deceased, whereas, the appellants allegedly three 
in numbers, were not armed with any sort of weapon and the 
aforementioned eye witnesses, being close relatives of Rashid Ali 
(deceased), did not dare to capture any of the accused persons nor 
made serious efforts to save the deceased during the occurrence. They 
stood like silent spectators and gave free hand to the accused persons 
to inflict fist blows to their kith and kin and thereafter, to flee away 
from the spot. I am therefore, of the view that conduct of the eye 

7 
Crl. Appeal No. 26878 of 2024 &  
Crl. Revision No. 32182 of 2024. 
 
witnesses, who were closely related to Rashid Ali (deceased) was 
highly unnatural; therefore, their presence at the spot is doubtful and 
their evidence is not worthy of reliance. Reference in this context may 
be made to the cases of “LIAQUAT ALI Vs. THE STATE” (2008 
SMCR 95), “PATHAN Vs. THE STATE” (2015 SCMR 315) & 
“ZAFAR Vs. THE STATE and others” (2018 SCMR 326). 
 
9.  
Another piece of evidence produced by the prosecution 
before the Court in respect of identification of the accused/appellants 
was in the form of footage allegedly contained in a CD (P-1) and 
photographs P2/1-22 retrieved from CCTVs Installed by Punjab Safe 
City Authority, Lahore. Complainant talked about handing over of CD 
& Photographs by the Expert/Incharge of Safe City Project to 
investigating officer but PW-12 Ghulam Ali SI/IO deposed about 
handing over of CD (P-1) only. No certificate of an expert was 
available nor he or any other witness appeared in the dock to depose 
about making of video or preparation of photographs from above 
CCTV footage. PW-12 investigating officer conceded that he did not 
submit application to SP investigation Iqbal town Lahore seeking 
permission to see CCTV footage at the office of Safe City Project. He 
also did not tender in evidence the copy of application made by him 
before said Incharge nor he recorded his statement. It was claimed by 
him that though he examined the private CCTV as well which were 
installed at the place of occurrence, yet did not record the statement of 
any person in this respect nor took into possession the DVR etc. Thus, 
it remained a missing fact that who prepared the CD (P-1) & 
photographs P2/1-22. It is now well settled that photographs can be 
used as evidence yet it is essential to prove its source. Judgment 
approved for reporting Crl. Appeal No. 812-22 “ABDUL BASIT VS 
STATE ETC.” (2024 LHC 4466) is referred in this respect. 
 
10. 
PW-12 once again went to the office of Safe City Project on 
21.06.2018 where he again saw the CCTV footages from where it 
revealed that motorcycle having registration number LEK-17/1624 
was visible in such footage. Such motorcycle with original number 
was registered in the name of Muhammad Arshad s/o Muhammad 

8 
Crl. Appeal No. 26878 of 2024 &  
Crl. Revision No. 32182 of 2024. 
 
Anwar who when associated into investigation could not pass any 
information in respect of use of motorcycle in the occurrence except 
promise to produce his son Haziq for further information. On the same 
day Haziq PW-7 appeared before him and after viewing the 
photographs stated that persons present in photographs are his friends, 
i.e., 
the 
accused/appellants. 
Prosecution 
has 
also 
produced 
Muhammad Aleem Butt PW-6, employer of Ammar Shafi, appellant 
who claimed his identification through photographs P2/1-22 but did 
not state the date in his deposition before the Court that as and when 
he identified him. Such in-direct identification was of no use for the 
prosecution when photographs were not proved to be genuine. 
Muhammad Arshad did not enter into the dock nor his son Haziq PW-
7 uttered a single word that how such motorcycle had gone into the 
custody of accused/appellants. Using of fake number plates on 
motorcycle were also not proved during the trial because accused 
appellants were not convicted under said charges.   
 
11. 
Coming back to video evidence contained in CD (P-1), it is 
noteworthy that no certificate of expert was tendered in evidence nor 
an expert appeared in the witness box to verify the sanctity/ 
genuineness of the aforementioned video. It was also incumbent to get 
a photogrammetry test of accused/appellants from PFSA in order to 
provide evidence that they are the person visible in video retrieved 
from CCTV footage. Moreover, neither the Court has examined such 
CD while playing it in the Court nor it was shown to any witness 
during his statement who could have identified the assailants in the 
video. PW-12 investigating officer conceded to this effect in following 
words; 
“Video contained in CD is not being played at the moment 
in the court room” 
 
Thus, trial Court has not met the requirement of Article 71 & 139 of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 because CCTV footage can be used 
either as the documentary evidence or the real evidence. When it is 
being used as documentary evidence it must be shown to the witness 
while recording his statement and when it is used as real evidence then 

9 
Crl. Appeal No. 26878 of 2024 &  
Crl. Revision No. 32182 of 2024. 
 
court must inspect it with some observations and mere marking it as 
“P” does not fulfill the requirement. Thus, prosecution has failed to 
prove the contents of CD in accordance with the principles of 
evidence. Reliance in this respect is placed on case reported as 
“NUMAN alias NOMI and others Versus The STATE” (2023 PCr.LJ 
1394) & a case approved for reporting, Crl. Appeal No.592-
23“FAKHAR IQBAL SHAH VS STATE ETC.” (2024 LHC 4364). 
 
12. 
In the instant case CD was obtained from the office of 
Punjab Safe City project which is being operated under Punjab Safe 
City Authority Act 2016 and it maintains entirely a separate regime to 
make admissible the data retrieved from CCTVs installed by the 
Authority. Let’s see what it says. Punjab Safe City Authority was 
established for the purposes of construction, development and 
maintenance of a city-wide integrated command, control and 
communications (IC3) system in the major cities of the Punjab in 
order to ensure safety and security of the people, and for other 
purposes. The powers and functions assigned to the Authority under 
section 4 (2) (g) & (k) of Punjab Safe City Authority Act 2016 
(PSCA, 2016) include, to establish and maintain an effective oversight 
mechanism, and, to perform such other related functions as the 
Government may assign. Section 14(2) of PSCA, 2016 identifies an 
employee of such authority as an expert of following category; 
 
 (2)  An employee of the Authority working with information 
technology related matters shall be deemed to be an expert 
within the meaning of Article 59 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 (X of 1984), and shall be deemed to 
have been appointed under section 510 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 (V of 1898). 
  
Section 19 of PSCA, 2016 requires that subject to the Act and the 
rules, the Authority may, by notification in the official Gazette, frame 
regulations for giving effect to the provisions of the Act. Thus, Punjab 
Safe Cities Authority Electronic Data Regulations 2016 were framed 
by Notification No. 6027/PSCA/2016 which were published through 
Gazette Notification No. 178/2016 dated 2nd December, 2016. 
According to which “Electronic Data” means any probative data or 

10 
Crl. Appeal No. 26878 of 2024 &  
Crl. Revision No. 32182 of 2024. 
 
information in form of video/audio/picture, stored or transmitted in electronic 
format or on electronic media duly collected, recorded, generated or extracted 
through the ancillary facilities/equipment installed under the Act. Such data is 
analysed in “Electronic Data Analysis Cell”, which means a room/cabin/office 
space at IC3 dedicated and equipped for the investigation officers/law 
enforcement agencies to view/analyse/examine the information/video/audio/ 
picture for investigation/inquiry or for any lawful purpose. 
 
           For obtaining of any such data a request is made on “Electronic 
Data Request Form” which means a document for formal requisition of 
electronic data stored in the main data centres of IC3 administered/managed by 
the authority. Such data is provided with a document known as 
“Electronic Data Certificate” which means document issued by an authorized 
officer, certifying the genuineness of the electronic material recorded at IC3 with 
a detailed report of protocols applied by him for collection/extraction/ submission 
of evidence and said data is provided in “Electronic Data Storage Device” 
which means a disc/ USB/ CD/ DVD or any other storage medium, in which the 
electronic data is stored/transmitted/provided/sent/made available, for Investigation, 
Inquiry or Trial. 
13. 
Regulation-9 makes such data as an admissible piece of 
evidence and explains its presentation in proper form before the 
Court, format of report with protocols, rearrangement of evidence in 
consultation with prosecutor; understanding of electronic evidence by 
the Court; clarity and reexamination by Chief operating officer. Here 
it is for reference; 
9. Procedure to present Electronic, Evidence. - (1)     The 
Electronic Data Storage Device shall be produced and transmitted by 
the Authority to the Investigation Officers, Law Enforcement 
Agencies, Courts, Tribunals or any other authorized person for 
investigation, inquiry or trial as an admissible piece of evidence.  
(2)  The Chief Operating Officer or any other authorized officer of the 
authority shall issue an Electronic Data Certificate (Annex-B) to 
verify the genuineness of the Electronic Data and related information. 
(3)   The duly signed and verified Electronic Data Certificate shall be the 
formal confirmation from the authority of the genuineness of the data 
and information contained in the Electronic Data Storage device. 

11 
Crl. Appeal No. 26878 of 2024 &  
Crl. Revision No. 32182 of 2024. 
 
(4) 
The Electronic Data Certificate shall contain the technical details of 
the  electronic data in the Electronic Data Storage device. 
(5) 
The expert at IC3 centre shall provide full technical assistance to the 
court or any law enforcement agency in understanding of the forensic 
or electronic evidence or preparation of copies of the electronic data; 
if so required. 
(6) 
The investigation officer shall make the evidence presentable before 
the court in consultation with the prosecutor.  
(7) 
If the prosecutor requires the collection, recording, generation or 
extraction of any evidence from any equipment or facility in a 
particular manner, the investigation officer shall refer the matter to 
the Chief Operating Officer, who shall re-arrange. the evidence in 
proper form.  
 
(8) 
If, during any proceeding of Court, Tribunal or any other authorized 
person finds that opinion of expert is not clear, the matter shall be 
referred to Chief Operating Officer for clarification, who shall send 
clarification on the question within 03 days of the receipt of the 
reference. 
(9) 
If the Court or Tribunal directs the Managing Director or the Chief 
Operating Officer for re-examination of the expert opinion, the 
Chief Operating Officer shall constitute a panel for the purpose and 
present the report within 03 days thereof. 
The cumulative effect of above provisions explains that data in the 
form of video/audio/pictures obtained from IC3 under Punjab Safe 
City Authority Act 2016 and regulations made thereunder in due 
course of process shall be deemed genuine and admissible in 
evidence without sending such video/audio/pictures to Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency. However, such electronic data shall be 
read in evidence in conjunction with other explanation like 
photogrammetry test etc. of accused visible therein. In the instant 
case prosecution has failed to prove the due process adopted for 
obtaining the data from Safe City Authority nor Electronic Data 
Certificate was produced about genuineness of such data. Thus, CD 
or the pictures, the sole alleged impactful evidence of the 
prosecution, are not helpful to be read in the evidence.   
14. 
It was claimed that due to beating by accused/appellants, 
Rashid Ali (deceased) fell on the ground and became unconscious who 
was shifted to the hospital where the doctor has verified his death. On 
the other hand, Dr. Rifat Hayat Sukhera (PW-11) while noting the 
shalwar, qameez and vest of the deceased as not stained with blood or 

12 
Crl. Appeal No. 26878 of 2024 &  
Crl. Revision No. 32182 of 2024. 
 
mud observed that there were no marks of bruises or abrasions over his 
dead body. In his final opinion as mentioned in postmortem report, he 
wrote as under; 
“I am unable to comment on the cause of death in this case 
which may be due to natural course.” 
                   
Said doctor has not mentioned the time elapsed between injury and 
death rather kept it under observation (KUO) which is another factor 
creating doubt about the death of deceased in the circumstance as 
alleged by the prosecution. Dr. Faisal Shahid (CW-1) who was one of 
the members of the District Standing Medical Board, stated that 
DSMB has given its opinion in respect of cause of death as under: - 
“The cause of death in this case is acute cardiac event that leads to 
cardiopulmonary arrest and death. (May be due to extreme 
physical stress).” 
 
              During cross examination he admitted some facts as under; 
“It is correct that there is no device to determine the quantum of 
stress. Stress means any sort of worry. It is correct that 
cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal and endocrinal are the 
classification of natural death and all the said aspects carry equal 
importance.” 
               
Under the aforementioned circumstances, medical evidence 
is not supporting the ocular account rather it is in conflict with the 
same. In such circumstances, conflict in ocular and medical account is 
damaging for prosecution. Reliance is placed on case reported as 
“MUHAMMAD IDREES and another Vs. The STATE and others” (2021 
SCMR 612). Moreover, medical evidence by itself does not throw any 
light on the identity of the offender. Such evidence may confirm the 
available substantive evidence with regard to certain facts including 
seat of the injury, nature of the injury, cause of the death, kind of the 
weapon used in the occurrence, duration between the injuries and the 
death, and presence of an injured witness or the injured accused at the 
place of occurrence, but it does not connect the accused with the 
commission of the offence. It cannot constitute corroboration for 
proving involvement of the accused person in the commission of 
offence, as it does not establish the identity of the accused person. 
Reliance can be placed on the cases reported as “Yaqoob Shah v.

               15.  
Despite the fact no evidence of any actus reus was available 
in this case yet learned trial court convicted that accused/appellant for 
Qatl shibh-i-amd under section 316 of PPC, which is defined in 
section 315 PPC as under; 
315. Qatl shibh-i-amd 
Whoever, with intent to cause harm to the body or mind of any 
person, causes the death of that or of any other person by 
means of a weapon or an act which in the ordinary course of 
nature is not likely to cause death is said to commit qatl shibh-
i-amd. 
 
Illustration 
A in order to cause hurt strikes Z with a stick or stone which in 
the ordinary course of nature is not likely to cause death. Z dies 
as a result of such hurt. A shall be guilty of Qatl shibh-i-amd. 
                    
Above definition clearly speaks that if the intention is to cause harm 
to the body or mind by means of “any weapon or an act” which in 
ordinary course of nature does not cause death, then such offence 
would be attracted. In the instant case neither, the prosecution could 
prove any harm to body or to mind of the deceased through any ocular 
or medical evidence, or through any forensic techniques; so much so 
no weapon was proved to have been used in the occurrence. Thus, 
above offence was not committed in any manner and natural death of 
deceased was converted into a culpable homicide.   
            
16. 
As the deceased has been shown to be beaten by the accused 
persons with fists but no marks of injuries were observed by the 
doctor. Thus, story of prosecution was not only failed on ocular but on 
medical aspects as well. Therefore, no question of weapon-recovery

arises in this case, and as such nothing incriminating was shown 
recovered.  
17. 
Prosecution has not put forth any motive nor opted to lead 
any evidence in this respect. Thus, the same was shrouded in mystery.  
18. 
For what has been discussed above, I have no doubt to hold 
that here in this case the prosecution has miserably failed to establish 
the charge against the accused/appellants beyond any shadow of 
doubt. In the cases of “MAQSOOD ALAM and another Versus The 
STATE and others” (2024 SCMR 156), “ABDUL QADEER Versus The 
STATE” (2024 SCMR 1146), “MUHAMMAD IMTIAZ BAIG and another 
Versus The STATE through Prosecutor General, Punjab, Lahore and 
another” (2024 SCMR 1191), “MUHAMMAD HASSAN and another 
Versus The STATE and others” (2024 SCMR 1427), “KHIAL 
MUHAMMAD Versus The STATE” (2024 SCMR 1490) & “MUHAMMAD 
IJAZ alias BILLA and another Versus The STATE and others” (2024 
SCMR 1507), the Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that for giving 
benefit of doubt to an accused a single circumstance creating 
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about guilt of accused is sufficient 
to make him entitled to such benefit, whereas, in present case 
numerous doubts have crept into the evidence making whole edifice 
of prosecution unreliable. Thus, the prosecution has squarely failed to 
bring home the guilt against the accused/appellants. Consequently, 
Crl. Appeal No. 26878 of 2024 is allowed, impugned judgment of 
conviction & sentence is set-aide and the accused/ appellants are 
acquitted of the charges against them. They be released forthwith if 
not required to be detained in any other case. The case property, if 
any, be disposed of in accordance with law, and record of the learned 
trial Court be sent back immediately.  
19. 
For the above reasons, Crl. Revision No. 32182 of 2024, 
filed by the complainant is dismissed.
