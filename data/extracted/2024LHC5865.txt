MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant Reference Application under Section 196 of the Customs 
Act, 1969 (“the Act of 1969”), following questions of law, asserted 
to have arisen out of impugned judgment dated 30.01.2024, passed 
by learned Customs Appellate Tribunal, Bench-I, Lahore 
(“Appellate Tribunal”), have been pressed and argued for our 
opinion:- 
1. Whether the learned Tribunal has erred in law by upholding 
the confiscation of the applicants’ lawfully registered vehicle 
without considering that neither the vehicle was previously 
used in smuggling activities nor any false cavity was found 
therein, as required by clause (b) of the Preamble of SRO 
499(I)2009 dated 13.06.2009? 
2. Whether the learned Tribunal has failed to appreciate that 
clause (f) of SRO 499(I)2009 dated 13.06.2009 expressly 
empowers the adjudication authority / learned Tribunal to 
redeem the vehicle not covered under clause (b) of the 
preamble of said notification found carrying goods under 2(s) 
of the Customs Act, 1969? 
3. Whether the learned Tribunal has passed the impugned 
order in utter violation of judgments / orders passed by this 
Hon’ble Court reported as 2010 PTD 2015 (DB), 2016 PTD 
2388 Peshawar (DB)?

2. 
Brief facts as narrated in the statement of the case are that on 
23.02.2023, the staff of respondent-department, on information, 
intercepted Oil Tanker bearing Registration No.FDS-1057 on 
Vehari Road near Vehari City, loaded with 48,000 liters of High 
Speed Diesel Oil, however, the driver escaped from the spot while 
leaving the vehicle unlocked. Upon thorough search of the vehicle, 
neither any document was found inside the driver’s cabin nor 
anyone turned up to claim ownership or to produce any document 
showing legal import / lawful procurement of loaded goods i.e. 
HSD Oil weighing 48,000 liters (approx.), whereof the unknown 
person(s) and whosoever claims the ownership of the seized goods 
and carrier vehicle at any stage or those who will be endorsed by 
the possession-holder/ owner through legal documents, were 
charged with the violation of Sections 2(s), 16, 18, 156(2) & 
157(1)(2) of the Customs Act, 1969 and SRO 566(I)/2005 dated 
06.06.2005 read with Section 3(1) of the Import & Export (Control) 
Act, 1950 and Section 3 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990, Section 148 of 
the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 punishable under clause 89 of 
Section 156(1) & 157(1) & (2) of the Customs Act, 1969 read with 
Section 3(3) of the Act of 1950 ibid further read with SRO 
499(I)/2009 dated 13.06.2009. Accordingly, a show cause notice 
was issued on 05.04.2023, which culminated in passing of order-in-
original dated 27.04.2023 for outright confiscation of the seized oil/ 
goods and the vehicle. Feeling aggrieved, applicants filed appeal 
before learned Appellate Tribunal, which was dismissed vide 
impugned judgment dated 30.01.2024. Hence, instant Reference 
Application.  
3. 
Learned counsel for applicants submits that clause (f) of SRO 
499(I)2009 dated 13.06.2009 expressly empowers the adjudication 
authority / learned Appellate Tribunal to redeem the vehicle not 
covered under clause (b) of the preamble of said notification found 
carrying goods under 2(s) of the Act of 1969. He adds that there is a 
slight difference between vehicle “liable to be confiscated” and 

 
 
Customs Reference No.34648 of 2024 
 
3
“shall be confiscated” which has been interpreted by another 
learned Bench of this Court in judgment reported as Collector of 
Customs v. Customs Appellate Tribunal Bench-II, Lahore and 
others (2020 PTD 209) which was upheld by a three-member 
Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 02.03.2021, 
passed in C.A. 336/2020 to C.A. 345/2020 and C.P. 141 and 142 / 
2020 titled The Collector of Customs, Model Customs Collectorate, 
Multan v. Asmat Ullah Khan, etc. In support of his contentions, he 
has further relied upon Khan Wali v. The Collector MCC, Peshawar 
and 2 others (2016 PTD 2388) and order dated 15.07.2015, passed 
by this Court in Customs Reference No.52 of 2015 titled Nazir 
Ahmed v. Chairman, Customs Appellate Tribunal, etc. 
4. 
Contrarily, learned Legal Advisor for respondent-department 
defends the impugned Appellate Tribunal’s judgment by 
contending that learned counsel for applicant has failed to point out 
any illegality or legal infirmity therein, thus, same is liable to be 
upheld. In support, he has referred to order dated 02.12.2021, 
passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Petition No.1690-L/ 
2020 titled Director Intelligence & Investigation-Customs FBR, 
Faisalabad v. Muhammad Hashim, etc. and order dated 29.09.2020, 
passed by another learned Bench of this Court in Customs 
Reference No.45062 of 2020 titled Director Intelligence and 
Investigation v. Muhammad Hashim, etc.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
The words “shall be liable to confiscation” as used in Section 
157 of the Customs Act, 1969 are not synonymous to “shall be 
confiscated”, therefore, do not mean automatic confiscation. In the 
circumstances, learned Appellate Tribunal was not justified to 
deprive the applicants from the goods in question. They should 
have been given opportunity to produce evidence and their point of 
view should have been given due consideration, which is lacking in 
the instant case, as rightly held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in 
case reported as Haji Abdul Razzak v. Pakistan through Secretary, 

 
 
Customs Reference No.34648 of 2024 
 
4
Ministry of Finance, Islamabad and another (PLD 1974 Supreme 
Court 5), relevant portion whereof is reproduced hereunder, for 
ready reference:- 
“It appears to us that there is a great deal of force in the 
reasoning of the learned Judge in this case. If the words 
"liable to confiscation" give a discretion to the confiscating 
authority to deprive a person of his property, then it follows 
that this discretion must be exercised upon the principles of 
natural justice; that is to say, the persons sought to be 
deprived of the property must be given notice to show cause, 
they must be furnished with adequate opportunity of putting 
forward their point of view and the same must receive due 
consideration. Furthermore, according to one of the 
principles now well-accepted, no person should be deprived 
of his property by way of penalty unless it is clear that he is 
in some measure responsible for assisting or furthering the 
commission of the offence committed. 
No innocent person should be unjustly punished or 
deprived of his property. This was the cardinal principle 
which was followed by the learned Judge of the Calcutta 
High Court in the last mentioned case. We too think that this 
was the correct principle upon which the authorities should 
proceed.” 
 
7. 
The prime argument agitated before us is with regard to 
confiscation of vehicle under Section 157(2) of the Act of 1969. 
The words “shall be liable to confiscation” do not mean the same 
thing as the words “shall be confiscated”. The plain meaning of the 
words “shall be liable to confiscation” are that the conveyance may 
be confiscated in a proper case, otherwise the legislature would 
have used the words “shall be confiscated”. To make a thing liable 
to confiscation amounts to a declaration that the thing is available 
for confiscation. The use of the words “shall” here in the context 
only means that in a case the Court considers proper, it will have 
power to order the confiscation of the conveyance, as rightly held 
by another learned Bench of this Court in the judgment reported as 
Collector of Customs v. Customs Appellate Tribunal Bench-II, 
Lahore and others (2020 PTD 209) which was upheld by the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 02.03.2021, passed in 

 
 
Customs Reference No.34648 of 2024 
 
5
C.A. 336/2020 to C.A. 345/2020 and C.P. 141 and 142 / 2020 
titled The Collector of Customs, Model Customs Collectorate, 
Multan v. Asmat Ullah Khan, etc., consisting of a three-member 
Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The aforesaid order dated 
02.03.2021 is reproduced hereunder:- 
“Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and perused 
the record with his assistance, however, learned counsel has 
not been able to show us any defect or lacuna in the 
impugned orders, factual or otherwise. No case is made out 
for interfering with the impugned orders. The petitions are 
accordingly dismissed.” 
 
8. 
The phrase “liable to be confiscated” indicates a 
discretionary power vested in the authority to decide whether 
confiscation is warranted based on the facts and circumstances of 
the case. It does not impose a mandatory requirement but rather 
provides an option for the authority to consider.  This phrase 
invokes the principle of proportionality, requiring the authority to 
weigh the severity of the offense, the intent, and any mitigating 
factors before deciding on confiscation. The exercise of discretion 
implies adherence to principles of natural justice, such as issuing a 
show cause notice, providing an opportunity to be heard, and 
ensuring fair adjudication. It allows authorities to evaluate the case, 
consider alternative penalties, or even waive confiscation if 
justified.  
Whereas the phrase “shall be confiscated” denotes a 
mandatory requirement that leaves no room for discretion. Once the 
specified legal conditions are satisfied, confiscation becomes 
obligatory and must be carried out.  This indicates that the 
legislature has already deemed confiscation proportional to the 
violation, removing the need for further evaluation by the authority. 
Since the action is mandatory, the opportunity to contest may be 
limited to challenging the grounds for the mandatory action, not the 
authority’s discretion. This reflects a clear legislative intent to make 
confiscation compulsory under the specified circumstances. 

 
 
Customs Reference No.34648 of 2024

The phrase “shall also be liable to confiscated” as provided in 
Section 157(2) of the Customs Act, 1969 does not mean that 
vehicle should be confiscated automatically. This discretion must 
be exercised upon the principles of natural justice. According to one 
of the principles now well-accepted, no person should be deprived 
of his property by way of penalty unless it is clear that he is 
responsible for assisting or furthering the commission of the 
offence committed and no innocent person should be unjustly 
punished or deprived of his property.  
The phrase “shall be confiscated” means shall stand 
confiscated. Keeping in juxtaposition of both phrases with each 
other, the derivative conclusion is that Legislature has provided two 
different modes to be applied for confiscation in two different 
situations. The distinction between the two has been made in rule 
laid down in the case of Haji Abdul Razzak supra wherein, the 
phrase “liable to confiscation” has not been equated with the term 
“shall be confiscated”. In case where an article is made only liable 
to confiscation, a discretion is given but such discretion has to be 
exercised on sound judicial principles. Reliance is placed upon 
Haji Abdul Razzak v. Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of 
Finance, Islamabad and another (PLD 1974 Supreme Court 5), 
Gulistan v. The State (1993 SCMR 316), Suleman v. The State 
[PLD 1962 (W.P.) Lahore 11], Hafiz Ullah v. The State (2003 P 
Cr. L J 436) and Collector of Customs v. Customs Appellate 
Tribunal Bench-II, Lahore and others (2020 PTD 209). 
9. 
As regards the order dated 02.12.2021, passed by the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Petition No.1690-L/ 2020 supra, 
relied upon by learned Legal Advisor for respondent-department, 
which consists of a three-member Bench, relevant portion whereof 
is reproduced as under:- 
“None present for the respondents. The question before us 
is limited to the issue as to whether a vessel carrying 
smuggled goods, in the present case smuggled diesel, can 

 
 
Customs Reference No.34648 of 2024 
 
7
be confiscated or not. The learned counsel in this regard 
refers to subsection 2 of section 157 of the Customs Act, 
1969, which is very explicit on the point and reads as 
follows: 
(2) Every conveyance of whatever kind used in the removal 
of any goods liable to confiscation under this Act shall also 
be liable to confiscation.  
Provided that, where a conveyance liable to confiscation has 
been seized by an officer of customs, the [appropriate 
officer] may, in such circumstances as may be prescribed by 
rules, order its release, pending the adjudication of the case 
involving its confiscation if the owner of the conveyance 
furnishes him with a sufficient guarantee from a scheduled 
bank for the due production of the conveyance at any time 
and place it is required by the [appropriate officer] to be 
produced.” 
2. 
In view of the foregoing, the learned counsel, in the 
facts and circumstances of the case, is just and fair in 
contending that the subject vehicle which was admittedly 
carrying the smuggled diesel was lawfully confiscated. The 
petition is therefore converted into an appeal and is allowed.” 
 
 
It suffices to say that the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held in 
a number of esteemed judgments that a prior decision of the Court 
on identical facts and law binds the Court on the same points of law 
in a latter case. It is apparent that a contrary view was taken by the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court in order dated 02.12.2021 supra and in 
such a situation, the rule laid down in the case reported as Multiline 
Associates v. Ardeshir Cowasjee and 2 others (PLD 1995 Supreme 
Court 423) is required to have been followed, relevant portion 
whereof is as under:- 
“18. In such circumstances, legal position which emerges is that the 
second Division Bench of the High Court should not have given 
finding contrary to the findings of the 1st Division Bench of the same 
Court on the same point and should have adopted the correct 
method by making a request for constitution of a larger Bench, if a 
contrary view had to be taken. In support reference can be made to 
the cases of the Province of East Pakistan v Dr. Azizul Islam (PLD 
1963 SC 296) and Sindheswar Ganguly v. State of West Bengal 
(PLD 1958 SC (Ind.) 337), which is a case of Indian jurisdiction. We 
therefore, hold that the earlier judgment of equal Bench in the High 
Court of the same point is binding upon the second Bench and if a 
contrary view had to be taken, then request for constitution of a 
larger Bench should have been made.”

10. 
Any decision by a later Bench of the same strength that 
disregards prior rulings of benches of equal strength within the 
same Court will hold no precedential value. Reliance is placed upon 
Qaiser and another v. The State (2022 SCMR 1641) and Hasnain 
Raza and another v. Lahore High Court, Lahore and others (PLD 
2022 Supreme Court 7).   
11. 
In our view, our answer to the proposed questions is in 
affirmative i.e. in favour of applicant and against the respondent-
department.  
 
This 
Reference 
Application 
is 
decided 
against the 
respondent-department.

Office shall send a copy of this judgment under seal of the 
Court to learned Appellate Tribunal as per Section 196 (5) of the 
Act of 1969.
