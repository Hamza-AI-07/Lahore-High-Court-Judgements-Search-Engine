 Mian Khalid Habib Elahi, Advocate for the petitioners. 
 
 
Petitioners in this civil revision challenge the 
judgments and decree dated 30.6.2022 and 26.4.2023 of 
the courts below whereby their suit for preemption was 
dismissed and appeal thereagainst was declined. 
2. 
Late Muhammad Munir now represented by the 
petitioners instituted a suit for preemption to preempt 
the sale of suit property claiming to possess superior 
right of preemption as Shafi Sharik and Shafi Jar with 
the averments that he came to know of the sale through 
Muhammad Riaz son of Faiz Ahmad on 02.12.2013 at 
3.00 p.m. in the presence of Muhammad Sharif son of 
Abdul Haq and that he spontaneously made Talb-e-
Muwathibat by declaring that he would file suit for 
preemption and that, thereafter, notices of Talb-e-
Ishhad were separately sent to the purchasers through 
registered post with acknowledgment due and that the 
respondents did not accept the right of preemption, 

C.R. No.63814 of 2023

therefore, indulgence of the court for decree of 
preemption was sought. Respondents contested the suit 
on legal and factual grounds mainly stating that lack of 
knowledge of sale was feigned by the plaintiff and that 
the story of Talbs was entirely concocted. He 
throughout knew of the sale and requisite Talbs were 
never made as obligated under the provision of section 
13 of the Punjab Preemption Act, 1991 (the “Act”), 
therefore, the plea of preemption stood extinguished 
and that the suit property was purchased at the price as 
reflected in the mutation which was actually paid. 
Issues were framed, evidence was led by the parties 
whereafter the learned Civil Judge on analytical 
scrutiny of evidence, concluded that the petitioners had 
the superior right of preemption, the price fixed in the 
mutation was not proved to be fictional and that the 
requisite Talbs having not been made, the right of 
preemption was extinguished. In result, the suit was 
dismissed. In appeal, the learned Addl. District Judge 
affirmed the findings as to the superior right of 
preemption  with the modification that the claimant was 
Shafi Jar only. Findings as to Talbs were not interfered 
with and it was noted that the same had not been 
specifically challenged in the grounds of appeal which 

C.R. No.63814 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-3- 
 
 
would entail that such findings of the trial court had 
been accepted. Findings qua price were also affirmed. 
As upshot the appeal was dismissed vide impugned 
judgment dated 26.4.2023.  
3. 
Heard. 
4. 
Facts discernible from the file are that late 
Muhammad Munir instituted a suit to preempt the sale 
made in favour of respondents vide mutation No. 283 
dated 11.11.2013. The suit was  filed on 19.12.2013 
wherein it was asserted that the plaintiff had no 
knowledge of the sale; that on 02.12.2013 Muhammad 
Riaz son of Muhammad Faiz came to his house at 3:00 
p.m. and disclosed that the land in front of his house 
had been sold by the respondents at which the plaintiff 
proclaimed his intent to bring a suit to preempt the sale 
and that on the very next day i.e. 03.12.2013 notices of 
Talb-e-Ishhad were duly sent which were allegedly 
served and that the plaintiff had superior right of 
preemption as against the respondents and that the sale 
was made for Rs.65,00,000/- but the price was instead 
fictionally inflated to Rs. 1,65,00,000/- in the mutation 
for prohibitive purposes. Defense taken was that suit 
was not maintainable; that Muhammad Munir was very 
much cognizant of the sale from day one; that no Talbs 

C.R. No.63814 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-4- 
 
 
were made; that the preconditions of Talbs as per 
section 13 of Act supra having not been observed the 
suit was not maintainable and that the alleged plea of 
Talbs 
was 
false 
and 
fabricated. 
Claimant      
Muhammad Munir appeared in the evidence as P.W.2 
and deposed in his examination-in-chief that the land 
was sold on 11.12.2013 (though in point of fact 
mutation was attested on 11.11.2013) and that on 
02.12.2013 at 3.00 p.m. when he was sitting in his 
house with Muhammad Sharif son of Abdul Haq, 
Muhammad Riaz son of Muhammad Faiz came to his 
house and informed that he had gone to Lala Musa 
where it was disclosed that the suit land in front of the 
house of the plaintiff  had been sold and that in the 
same Majlis he made jumping-demand and announced 
intent to sue to preempt the sale. In cross-examination 
P.W.2 was unable to disclose the number of the khatuni 
and khasra of the suit property or basic details of the 
khatajaat of which the suit land was comprised. He was 
asked as to who told Muhammad Riaz in Lala Musa 
about the sale when he expressed his ignorance about 
the name of the source/informer. Muhammad Riaz 
appeared as P.W.3 who deposed that on 02.12.2013 at 
3:00 p.m. he went to the house of late Muhammad 

C.R. No.63814 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-5- 
 
 
Munir where Muhammad Sharif was sitting when he 
told Muhammad Munir that the land in front of his 
house had been sold at which Muhammad Munir 
declared that he would file a suit to preempt the same. 
In cross-examination Muhammad Riaz was specifically 
asked about the person from whom he got the 
information of sale in Lala Musa but he expressed his 
ignorance about the name of the informer. Muhammad 
Sharif a close relative of the plaintiff while appearing in 
the witness-box as P.W.3 reiterated the same narrative 
and also indicated his ignorance about the name of the 
informer who had allegedly brought Muhammad Riaz 
the news of sale. 
5. 
Section 13 of the Act contemplates that right of 
the preemptor shall extinguish if the preemptor fails to 
make the requisite Talbs in terms of the law. As per 
said provision the right of preemption shall be 
extinguished unless a person makes the mandatory 
Talb-e-Muwathibat, 
Talb-e-Ishhad 
and 
Talb-e-
Khasoomat. It is a tight-rope walk.  The preemptor in 
the first instance has to establish that Talb-e-
Muwathibat (i.e. the demand to preempt the sale at the 
very spur of cognition of sale) failing which the right 
shall become extinct. For proving Talb-e-Muwathibat it 

C.R. No.63814 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-6- 
 
 
was incumbent to prove who informed about the sale, at 
what date, time and place the preemptor received the 
information, who was present in the Majlis when Talb-
e-Muwathibat was made and further that there was no 
delay in this expression of intent as the very first re-
action on information of sale i.e. immediate declaration 
by the preemptor that he had a right to preempt the 
reported sale which he shall enforce. In this respect, the 
source of knowledge i.e. the person who informed 
about the sale, the precise time at which he received the 
information and his immediate response to preempt the 
sale are integral elements that need to be established by 
evidence of unimpeachable probative value in the form 
of credible, independent and truthful witnesses. The 
statement of the informer in this context becomes a 
necessary condition to weight the value and operation 
of other factors. The property subject-matter of 
preemption was admittedly located in front of the house 
of the plaintiff which is so admitted by P.W.3 and also 
by P.W.2. The land was sold on 11.11.2013, the 
mutation was attested in an open public meeting in the 
village on 11.11.2013 but it was claimed that plaintiff 
had no knowledge. It was not the case in the plaint that 
the plaintiff had been away from the village on material 

C.R. No.63814 of 2023

dates. It is a safe generalization that at the time of 
concluding the terms and conditions of sale for 
settlement of transaction, a prudent buyer would visit 
the property to satisfy about title and possession as a 
part of bona fide inquiry. Even after the sale, possession 
is transferred pursuant to the conveyance of title and 
physical change takes place at site.  In the case at hand 
possession was given with the sale (i.e. on the very 
same date) yet the plaintiff expected that courts should 
receive his disavowal of knowledge of sale as credible 
and accept his attribution of this knowledge to 
Muhammad Riaz, his brother, of communicating the 
factum of sale on reverting from Lala Musa. On the 
face of it the story did not stick. Change of physical 
possession at site under the sale served as a public 
notice in the area. In agricultural settings such news 
spreads like bushfire. Yet the claimant Muhammad 
Munir who was residing in house in front of the suit 
property, attempted to come across as blissfully 
ignorant of it. 
 
6. 
Be that as it may, the claimant to action of 
preemption 
could 
not 
prove 
version 
about 
communication of sale by P.W.3 Muhammad Riaz who 
was his real brother and admitted to this close relation 

C.R. No.63814 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-8- 
 
 
and alleged in his statement that he travelled to Lala 
Musa where he received news about the sale and that on 
the next day at 3:00 p.m. he visited his brother 
Muhammad Munir and exited the house of the latter 
just after five minutes. Strangely enough he did not 
know the name of the person who allegedly had told 
him of the sale at Lala Musa. Same was the statement 
of the plaintiff as P.W.2 who testified that he did not 
know the name of the person who allegedly told 
Muhammad Riaz about the sale. It was not denied that 
P.W.3 was neither a witness to the sale nor claimed to 
be present at the time of attestation of mutation and he 
was not even able to offer the proper name of the 
individual who gave him news of the sale. In such 
circumstances the statement being completely hearsay 
could not be banked upon. The production of the person 
who allegedly informed P.W.3 about the sale was very 
material which was withheld and raised adverse 
inference against the claim.  
7. 
Under the law the informer is expected to show 
and prove that he acquired information through reliable 
source, like the patwari and/or tehsildar or that he 
himself was present at the time of sale or had the 
occasion to be present in the patwarkhana for any other 

C.R. No.63814 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-9- 
 
 
personal purpose but no such context was claimed to 
exist. It also begs the question as to why Muhammad 
Riaz P.W.3 was interested in getting information of the 
sale from a third person or why he felt it necessary to 
immediately visit the plaintiff to communicate about the 
sale, unless he claimed that the plaintiff was interested 
in purchasing the property beforehand and that he had 
deputed P.W.3 to keep an eye out for getting 
information if any transaction took place so as to 
exercise the right of preemption. This however would 
make the plaintiff’s disavowal of the developments 
under his own nose ring all the more hollow. In any 
case no such instructions were claimed either by the 
plaintiff in his deposition or by P.W.3 to have been 
imparted. Another question would be as to why a third 
person shall discuss about the sale of a third party 
which did not have any concern with P.W.3 and what 
was the occasion for such person to make such 
disclosure to Muhammad Riaz and also as to how such 
informer came into the specific knowledge about the 
sale being allegedly imparted to P.W.3. This entire link 
of necessary contextual facts required to be established 
remained beclouded in mystery as the name of the third 
person was not known to alleged informer P.W.3 nor 

C.R. No.63814 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-10- 
 
 
was he produced in the witness-box and total reliance of 
the plaintiff was on the hearsay evidence of Muhammad 
Riaz. Plaintiff in these circumstances failed to prove 
that he got knowledge of the sale on 02.12.2013 at 3:00 
p.m from Muhammad Riaz. Rest of the superstructure 
built on this assumption with such failure shall come 
aground.  
8. 
The learned Addl. District Judge also made an 
indepth scrutiny of the evidence and correctly observed 
that there were discrepancies in statements of witnesses 
and that the statements of P.W.2 to P.W.4 were 
unworthy of consideration and that the plaintiff had 
failed to prove Talbs in accordance with law. In result 
his right to preemption had extinguished. The findings 
of the courts below as to the absence of requisite Talbs 
are proper and do not suffer from any error of law, legal 
infirmity or misreading of record as to warrant 
interference.   
9. 
In result there is no merit in this revision petition 
which is dismissed.
