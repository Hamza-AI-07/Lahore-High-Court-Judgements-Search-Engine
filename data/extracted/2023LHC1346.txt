Malik Muhammad Arshad Kundi, Advocate, with the 
Petitioner. 
Mr. Muhammad Mustafa Chaudhry and Rana Tasawar Ali 
Khan, Deputy Prosecutors General. 
 
 
  
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Through this application, 
the Petitioner seeks pre-arrest bail in case FIR No.545/2022 dated 
4.11.2022 registered at Police Station Kundian, District Mianwali, 
for offences under sections 21(1), 21(2)(b), and 21-A of the 
Agricultural Pesticides Ordinance, 1971 (the “Ordinance”). 
2. 
 
The prosecution case is that the Petitioner runs a 
general store at Noon Market Melaywali. On 2.11.2022, Amir 
Sohail, Inspector Pesticides/Agriculture Officer Plant Protection, 
seized expired pesticides from his shop which he was offering for 
sale. During interrogation, the Complainant found he had no 
licence to sell such items. 
3. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
4. 
 
The police have booked the Petitioner under sections 
21(2)(a), 21(2)(b) and 21-A of the Ordinance. Section 21(1) 
makes it illegal to import, manufacture, formulate, sell, stock or 
advertise adulterated and substandard pesticides. Clause (a) of 
section 21(2) provides for the punishment for adulterated 
pesticides, while clause (b) thereof provides for the punishment of 
substandard pesticides. Section 3 defines the terms “adulterated” 
and “substandard” as follows: 
(a) 
“adulterated” in relation to a pesticide means a 
pesticide with which spurious, deleterious or harmful 
substance has been mixed or which is wholly or mainly 
ineffective for the purpose for which it is intended. 

Crl. Misc. No. 72710/B/2022 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
 
(rr) 
“substandard” when used with reference to a pesticide, 
means any pesticide, the strength or purity of which 
falls below the professed standard or quality which is 
expressed on its label or under which it is sold or a 
pesticide any valuable ingredient of which has been 
wholly or partially extracted. 
5. 
 
The term “expired pesticide” is neither expressly 
defined nor mentioned in the Ordinance nor the Rules made 
thereunder (Punjab Agriculture Pesticides Rules, 2018). There is 
only one reference in Rule 13(1)(b) of the Rules of 2018 which 
reads as follows: 
13. 
Packing, re-packing or re-filling of pesticides.– The 
manufacturers and formulators, before passing on the 
pesticides to the distributors, dealers or retailers, shall 
supervise: 
(a) 
… 
(b) 
affixation of the date of expiry, price, label the name, 
address and phone number of the manufacturer and 
formulator. 
6. 
 
Does the “expired pesticide” fall in the definition of 
“substandard” given in clause (rr) of section 3 of the Ordinance? 
7. 
 
“Substandard” 
products 
are 
those 
which 
are 
authorized but do not fulfil their quality standards or 
specifications. In this sense, they are distinct from “falsified” 
products, which intentionally or fraudulently misrepresent their 
identity, 
composition 
or 
source. 
Falsification 
includes 
substitutions and reproduction and/or manufacturing of an 
unauthorized product. Falsified products consist of innovator and 
generic products and items that lack active ingredients, have 
insufficient active ingredients, have the wrong ingredient, and/or 
contain hazardous contaminants or pathogens. 
8. 
 
Product labels have various dates, each with its own 
meaning. Manufacturers use these dates to share special 
information with buyers. The “expiry date” advises buyers of the 
date up to which the manufacturer expects his product to retain its 
claimed efficacy, safety, quality or potency. The use-by-date alerts 
consumers when the product’s quality may degrade. The phrase 
“best by date” indicates that the item’s taste, flavour or texture 
may deteriorate beyond that date. Therefore, even after the  

Crl. Misc. No. 72710/B/2022 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
 
“best before date”, a product can be consumed because it is safe 
though it may not be as good as if used within the stipulated time 
limit. On the other hand, once the “expiry date” passes, the 
product is not fit for consumption. 
9. 
 
The term “substandard” in section 3(rr) applies to 
two types of products: (a) the pesticide whose strength or purity 
falls below the purported standard or quality specified on its label 
or under which it is sold; (b) the pesticide whose valuable 
ingredient has been wholly or partially extracted. Pesticides that 
have passed their expiration date lose their effectiveness. They 
may also change chemical composition, harming not just the crop 
but also people and the environment. Pesticides sprayed too close 
to water might drift and deposit fine spray droplets away from 
their target, contaminating surface water. Drift incidents can 
pollute surface water more than runoff or leaching. Therefore, 
expired pesticides are included in part (a) of the definition of 
“substandard” given in section 3(rr) of the Ordinance. 
Consequently, the provisions of section 21(2)(b) apply when a 
person sells expired pesticides. 
10. 
 
The 
Petitioner’s 
counsel 
contended 
that 
the 
prosecution must demonstrate through a laboratory test that an 
expired pesticide has become “substandard” before alleging a 
violation of section 21(2)(b) of the Ordinance. I am afraid that is 
not required because the manufacturer declares on the label that 
the product’s quality will deteriorate after the expiry date. 
11. 
 
The Petitioner is also accused of selling pesticides 
without a licence. The Deputy Prosecutor General admitted that 
the Ordinance does not provide for such an offence. Therefore, in 
my opinion, section 21-A of the Ordinance would apply. That 
offence is also cognizable and non-bailable under section 26-A. 
12. 
 
The Petitioner has failed to point out any mala fides 
on the part of the Complainant or the police regarding registration 
of the instant case, which is a pre-requisite for the grant of pre-
arrest bail. In Muhammad Sadiq and another v. The State and 

Crl. Misc. No. 72710/B/2022 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
 
another (2015 SCMR 1394), the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled 
that bail before arrest is an extraordinary relief. It is meant to 
protect innocent people implicated in a criminal case for devious 
and ulterior motives. It cannot be granted unless the accused meets 
the conditions mentioned in section 497(2) Cr.P.C. He must 
demonstrate that reasonable grounds exist to believe that he is not 
guilty of the alleged offence and there are sufficient grounds to 
warrant further inquiry. In Aamir Bashir and another v. The 
State and others (2017 SCMR 2060), the Supreme Court held that 
“besides making out a prima-facie case for the grant of pre-arrest 
bail, the accused-petitioner must show some mala fide on the part 
of the complainant and the investigating agency.”  
13. 
 
This application is dismissed.
