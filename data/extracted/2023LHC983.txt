Through 
this 
constitutional petition filed under Article 199 of Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, petitioner has challenged the 
vires of order dated 18.03.2022 passed by learned Appellate Court 
whereby while accepting the appeal of the respondent No.3 her 
execution petition was restored.  
2. 
Facts in brevity are that respondent No.3 instituted a suit on 
17.02.2005 for recovery of dower against the petitioner. Suit was 
partially decreed vide ex-parte judgment & decree dated 
18.04.2006 and she was declared entitled to recover Rs.20,00,000/- 
as dower. Feeling dissatisfied, she preferred an appeal which was 
dismissed by the learned Appellate Court via judgment & decree 
dated 17.10.2006. Being aggrieved, respondent No.3 approached 
this Court through constitutional petition (W.P. No.6327 of 2006) 
titled “Mst. Saira Zulfiqar V. Addl. District Judge, etc.” which was 
allowed after contest by this Court vide judgment dated 17.06.2008 

W.P. No.6002 of 2022.

and  suit of respondent No.3 was decreed as a whole in the 
following terms: 
“Thus this petition is accepted, the findings of the learned 
Judge Family Court and that of learned Addl. District Judge 
and impugned judgments & decrees dated 18.04.2006 and 
17.10.2006 respectively are set-aside to the extent of the 
properties mentioned therein. The petitioner is held entitled to 
the properties and the gold ornaments as envisaged in the 
Nikahnama Mark-A read with Iqrarnama Mark-K dated 
18.09.2001.” 
 
 
It is also apprised to the Court that the petitioner assailed the 
judgment/order of this Court before august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan which was dismissed via order dated 29.09.2008 and his 
review petition also met the same fate.  
 
For the satisfaction of the decree, respondent No.3 filed an 
execution petition on 30.07.2016. While gaining knowledge qua 
pendency of said execution petition, petitioner filed an objection 
petition by raising certain objections; especially that the execution 
petition is barred by limitation. Respondent No.3 filed its contesting 
written reply. Learned executing Court, vide order dated 
05.04.2018 allowed the objection petition and dismissed execution 
petition of respondent No.3 being barred by more than 08 years. 
Feeling aggrieved, latter moved an application for recalling of said 
order on 29.01.2021 which was dismissed by the learned executing 
Court vide order dated 02.11.2021.  Respondent No.3 assailed the 
order/judgment of learned Executing Court dated 05.04.2018 
through preferring an appeal. Along with the appeal, she moved an 
application u/s 05 of the Limitation Act, 1908. Learned Appellate 
Court allowed the appeal of respondent No.3, set-aside the order of 
learned Executing Court dated 05.04.2018 and directed the 
Executing Court to proceed further as per law in the following 
terms: 
“This being so, I am of the firm opinion that plaintiff/decree 
holder was entitled to file her execution petition on 
30.07.2016, on the basis of decree of dower passed by 
Hon’ble Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, Multan on 
17.06.2008. The impugned order of the learned executing 
Court dated 05.04.2018, was thus, found illegal & void-ab-

intio. As there is no limitation to challenge void order, hence, 
limitation is not applicable on instant appeal. Appeal is found 
based on well entrenched, valuable legal rights of the decree 
holder/appellant which is hereby accepted. Impugned order is 
set-aside as the appellant/decree-holder will appear in the 
executing Court on 01.04.2022. Executing Court will proceed 
in the execution petition as per law.” 
 
 
 Being dissatisfied, petitioner approached this Court through 
instant constitutional petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner argued 
that execution petition was clearly hit by principle of limitation as 
respondent No.3 filed her execution petition for recovery of dower 
on 30.07.2016 for the execution of judgment of this Court dated 
17.06.2008. He adds that learned executing Court rightly dismissed 
the execution petition being barred by time and the said order is in 
accordance with law; even otherwise, against a void order 
limitation would run and in this regard he relied upon case laws 
cited as “NEMATULLAH KHAN V. ADDITIONAL DISTRICT 
JUDGE AND OTHERS (2022 YLR NOTE 21), “KHUDADAD V. 
SYED GHAZANFAR ALI SHAH ALIAS S. INAAM HUSSAIN AND 
OTHERS (2022 SCMR 933)”, “MUHAMMAD SHARIF & 
OTHERS V. MCB BANK LIMITED AND OTHERS (2021 SCMR 
1158), “HAJI WAJDAD V. PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT 
THROUGH SECRETARY BOARD OF REVENUE GOVERNMENT 
OF BALOCHISTAN, QUETTA AND OTHERS (2020 SCMR 2046), 
“STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN THROUGH GOVERNOR AND 
ANOTHER V. IMTIAZ ALI KHAN AND OTHERS” (2012 SCMR 
280). Further argued that the appeal of respondent No.3 is also 
barred by more than 03 years for which she failed to adduce any 
reasonable cause, but the learned Appellate Court condoned the 
delay and accepted the appeal. In this regard he relied upon case 
titled “LT. COL. NASIR MALIK V. ADDITIONAL DISTRICT 
JUDGE, LAHORE AND OTHERS (2016 SCMR 1821).   
4. 
Contrariwise, learned counsel representing respondent No.3 
maintains that decree of dower was passed in favour of respondent 
No.3, which attained finality, therefore, her execution petition is 

W.P. No.6002 of 2022. 
-4-
quite within time as no limitation run against filing of an execution 
for recovery of dower and learned Appellate Court rightly allowed 
the appeal of respondent No.3 and remanded the matter for decision 
of execution petition in accordance with law.  
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
perused the record with their able assistance.  
6. 
In the light of submissions made by learned counsel for the 
parties, two moot points emerge on the surface. One, what is the 
limitation for filing of an execution petition for recovery of dower 
decree and second whether the learned Appellate Court was 
justified to condone the delay.  
7. 
Section 13 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 
relates to enforcement of decrees which reads as under: 
Enforcement of decrees.— (1) The Family Court shall pass a 
decree in such form and in such manner as may be prescribed, 
and shall enter its particulars in the prescribed register.  
(2) If any money is paid or any property is delivered in the 
presence of the Family Court, in satisfaction of the decree, it 
shall enter the fact of payment [or] the delivery of property, as 
the case may be, in the aforesaid register.  
(3) Where a decree relates to the payment of money and the 
decretal amount is not paid within time specified by the Court, 
not exceeding thirty days as the same shall, if the Court so 
directs be recovered as arrears of land revenue, and on 
recovery shall be paid to the decree-holder.  
(4) The decree shall be executed by the Court, passing it or by 
such other Civil Court as the District Judge may, by special or 
general order, direct.  
(5) A Family Court may, if it so deems fit, direct that any money 
to be paid under a decree passed by it be paid in such 
installments as it deems fit. 
8. 
Perusal of said provision it appears that no limitation is 
provided for filing of an execution petition in family cases.  
9. 
A cursory glance at Family Courts Act, 1964 shows that the 
legislature has left many vacant areas but it does not necessarily 
means that embargo has been placed upon the Family Court in the 

W.P. No.6002 of 2022. 
-5-
exercise of certain powers, confidence has been shown in the Court 
to proceed in the matter by exercising its inherent powers to avoid 
abuse of the process of law without any hindrance of the 
technicalities imposed by Civil Procedure Code, 1908. The purpose 
of enacting Family Courts Act is to frustrate the technicalities for 
the purpose of justice between the parties in the shortest possible 
manner. All that the Family Courts Act has done is that it has 
changed the forum, altered the method of trial and empowered the 
Court to grant better remedies. The purpose of enacting special law 
regarding the family disputes is for the purpose of advancement of 
justice and to avoid technicalities. It is settled proposition of law 
that Judge Family Court is competent to regulate its own 
proceedings as the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 does not 
make provisions for every conceivable eventuality for unforeseen 
circumstances.  
10. 
Provisions of Limitation Act, 1908 are not applicable in 
family matters in stricto-senso. The learned Executing Court by 
presuming in his own wisdom that limitation for filing an execution 
petition is governed by residuary Article 181 of the Limitation Act, 
1908 which provide a period of three years declared that execution 
petition of the respondent No.3 is barred by time. Article 181 of the 
Limitation Act, 1908 is residuary in nature which deals with the 
situation when someone had to move an application and not 
execution petition for which no period of limitation is provided in 
the Family Laws and even in the Limitation Act. Learned Executing 
Court while appreciating Article 181 of the Limitation Act, 1908, 
has erred in law by applying it to the execution matter of family 
nature. An Executing Court while executing a family decree can 
exercise its own powers to prevent the course of justice being 
deflected from its path. To regulate the proceedings it has to 
proceed on the premises that every procedure is permissible unless 
clearly prohibition is found in law, meaning thereby that Family 
Court can exercise its powers but is not debarred to follow the 
principles of other laws coupled with the facts. Proceedings of the 

W.P. No.6002 of 2022.

Family Court, whether as a Trial Court or an Executing Court are 
governed by the general principles of equity, justice & fair play.  
11. 
No specific period of limitation for implementation of decree 
of dower can be fixed and whenever wife moves the legal forum for 
satisfaction of her right, husband is under legal obligation to satisfy 
such decree. Postponement of recovery of dower for any 
consideration during subsistence of marriage would not deprive the 
wife from execution of the decree being barred by time. August 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in a similar type of situation in case 
titled “SYED MUHAMMAD V. MST. ZEENAT & OTHERS (PLD 
2001 SC 128=2001 SCJ 297) held as under: 
“In respect of latter question, however, it was held that decree 
of dower cannot be refused to be executed being barred by 
limitation. Therefore, we would confine ourselves only to this 
aspect of the case. According to Article 103 of Limitation Act all 
suits for the decree of prompt dower can be instituted within 
three years from its demand whereas time prescribed for the 
suit of deferred dower is three years under Article 104 of the 
Limitation Act. In the instant case as tie of marriage exists 
between the parties, therefore, decree dated 24th October, 1979 
for recovery of dower would be deemed to be in respect of her 
prompt dower which consists of both the money as well as the 
property. Now the question for consideration is that what 
should be the period of limitation for filing of execution 
application for satisfaction of prompt dower. As far as section 
48, C.P.C. is concerned its provisions cannot be pressed into 
service because under section 17 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 except its sections 10 and 11 is 
not applicable to proceedings before any Family Court. As far 
as Limitation Act is concerned under its Article 182 period for 
execution of a decree of any Civil Court has been prescribed to 
be three years but in our opinion as the Family Court is not a 
Civil Court stricto senso, therefore, the provisions of this Article 
can also not be pressed into service. Thus reliance has to be 
placed on the residuary Article i.e. Article 181 of the Limitation 
Act, which provides the period of three years when the right to 
apply accrues. As it has been noted hereinabove that nature of 
the liability is of prompt dower, recognition of which has been 
made judicially by a Family Court in favour of respondent 
because the prompt dower is to be recovered during subsistence 
of marriage, therefore, no specific period of limitation for 
implementation of decree of such nature can be fixed because 
due to subsistence of marriage the judgment-debtor i.e. the 
husband acknowledges the right of his wife and he is deemed to 
remain under a legal obligation to satisfy the decree whenever 
the decree-holder/wife has moved the legal forum for 
satisfaction 
of 
her 
right. 
This 
proposition 
can 
be 
considered .from another angle i.e. that as tie of marriage exists 
between parties, therefore, the wife/decree-holder out 'of 
number 
of 
considerations 
may 
have 
postponed 
the 

W.P. No.6002 of 2022. 
-7-
implementation of the decree including the consideration that 
let relations between the spouses remain cordial or the husband 
is looking after her as well as other family members or the 
husband on account of his poor financial position is not in a 
position to implement the decree but such postponement for any 
consideration during subsistence of marriage would not deprive 
the decree-holder (wife) from execution of the decree being 
barred by time and no sooner proceedings of execution are 
launched that date would be treated as a denial by the 
judgment-debtor to satisfy the liability of prompt dower and 
Execution proceedings shall be considered within time as per 
requirement of Article 181 of Limitation Act. Thus for the above 
reasons no interference is called for in the impugned judgment 
passed by learned High Court of Balochistan.” 
 
12. 
Admittedly, marriage subsists between the parties and the 
nature of dower is of prompt dower, which was duly recognized by 
the Court. The prompt dower is recoverable during subsistence of 
marriage on demand. Therefore, no specific period of limitation for 
implementation of decree of such nature can be fixed. Due to 
subsistence of marriage, the judgment debtor, i.e. the husband 
acknowledges the right of his wife and he is deemed to remain 
under a legal obligation to satisfy the decree whenever the decree 
holder/wife has moved the legal forum for satisfaction of her right.  
13. 
Next question for determination is that whether the appellate 
Court was competent to entertain a time-barred appeal. Right of 
appeal is not merely a matter of procedure, rather it is a substantive 
right. There is no cavil that in terms of Rule 22 of the Family 
Courts Rules, 1965, an appeal under Section 14 of the Family 
Courts Act, 1964 shall be preferred within a period of 30 days of 
the passing of decree or decision but appellate Court is vested with 
the power to condone any delay in filing the appeal on showing 
sufficient cause by the appellant. This Court, while observing as 
above in a case titled  “MAQSOOD PERVAIZ CHAUDHRY V. MST. 
NOSHEEN CHAUDHRY & OTHERS (PLD 2019 LAHORE 102), 
held as under: 
“Even otherwise, when decree under appeal was apparently 
suffering illegalities and material irregularities, the learned 
Additional District Judge should have exercised its jurisdiction 
with great care and caution.”  

W.P. No.6002 of 2022.

14. 
In a case titled “PROVINCE OF PUNJAB THROUGH 
COLLECTOR AND OTHERS V. MUHAMMD FAROOQ AND 
OTHERS” (PLD 2010 SC 582), the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan observed as under: 
“Court could assume jurisdiction related to matter filed with 
delay, provided the merit of the case so demanded”.   
15. 
In case titled MST. YASMEEN BIBI V. MUHAMMAD 
GHAZANFAR KHAN AND OTHERS’ (PLD 2016 SC 613), the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court observed as under:- 
“Before parting with this judgment, it is essential to state that 
these petitions are barred by 2 and 4 days respectively, 
however, keeping in view the important law points of public 
importance, involved and because right of dower, dowry 
articles and maintained is involved, which cannot be rightly 
ignored, therefore, the delay of 2 and 4 days respectively, in 
filing these petitions is condoned”. 
 
16. 
Perusal of record it appears that respondent No.3 along with 
her appeal moved an application for extension of time/condonation 
of delay provided sufficient explanation resulting into delayed 
appeal. Said application was supported by an affidavit and no 
counter affidavit was filed by the petitioner in its rebuttal, therefore, 
the grounds urged in the application had gone unchallenged, hence, 
the contents of affidavit, having gone unchallenged, were deemed 
to be true. Reliance is placed on case titled “CIVIL AVIATION 
AUTHORITY V. PROVIDENCE AVIATION (PVT) (LTD).” (2000 
CLC 1722).  
17. 
It is a basic principle of administration of justice that cases 
must be decided on merits instead of technicalities and the 
technicalities should not be a hindrance in the way of justice. For 
reference, reliance is placed on “MANAGER, JAMMU & KASHMIR, 
STATE PROPERTY IN PAKISTAN V KHUDA YAR” (PLD 1975 
SC 678). Law of limitation should be liberally construed without 
giving violence to intention of legislature. Law must be applied for 
benefit of person who succeed in litigation. The principle in our 
jurisprudence governing just dispensation to do justice in 
accordance with law shall have to be kept in view.  

W.P. No.6002 of 2022.

18. 
Valuable rights accrued to respondent No.3 after decree of 
her suit for recovery of dower, therefore, it is not fair to deprive her 
from the benefits of decree. One who succeeds in a litigation 
unjustly must not retain the benefit. After acceptance of Nikah in 
lieu of dower and enjoying its blessings, it does not suit to a 
husband/judgment debtor/petitioner to question the maintainability 
of the execution petition on the point of limitation.  
19. 
For the foregoing reasons, learned Appellate Court has 
rightly allowed appeal of respondent No.3 and restored her 
execution petition by properly appreciating the peculiar facts & 
circumstances of the case. Learned counsel for the petitioner failed 
to point out any illegality, irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the 
impugned judgment of the Appellate Court, warranting interference 
by this Court in constitutional jurisdiction. So far as the case laws 
referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner are concerned, 
it is observed that the same are distinguishable from the 
facts/circumstances of the case in hand, hence, are not helpful for 
the petitioner.  
20. 
As an inevitable corollary of above discussion, this petition 
having no force/substance is dismissed with no order as to cost.
