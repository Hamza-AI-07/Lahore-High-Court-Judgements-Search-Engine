Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:- Through instant 
petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner has 
made the following prayer:- 
“In view of above, it is most respectfully 
prayed that the impugned order dated 
10.06.2019 passed by the respondent may 
please be declared to be unlawful and be set-
aside, and the respondent may please be 
directed to substitute / replace the present 
name of the company i.e., “Popular Sugar 
Mills Limited” instead of its old name 
“National Sugar Industries Limited” in the 
relevant record of the revenue department. 

Writ Petition No. 40356-2019

As ad an interim relief, the operation of the 
impugned order dated 10.06.2019 may please 
be suspended. 
Any other relief which this honourable Court 
deems appropriate may also be granted.” 
 
2.  
 
The facts, necessary for the decision of this 
petition, are that M/s National Sugar Industries 
Limited, incorporated in the year 1989, owns 
properties measuring 941-K 02-M and 12-K 11-M as 
further described in the petition (the „properties‟). M/s 
National Sugar Industries Limited approached the 
Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan 
(SECP) under section 39 read with section 40 of the 
Companies Ordinance, 1984 (the „Ordinance‟) for 
change of its name to Popular Sugar Mills Limited. 
The same was sanctioned by SECP vide certificate 
dated 13.11.2013. M/s Popular Sugar Mills Limited 
approached the concerned revenue officer 
for 
incorporating / reflecting the change of name in the 
revenue record on 25.01.2014. The request / 
application was turned down vide order dated 
24.11.2016. M/s Popular Sugar Mills Limited 
approached this Court through Writ Petition No. 7059 
of 2017, which was disposed of with the direction to 
re-decide the matter and order dated 24.11.2016 was 
set-aside. The application was once again turned down 
vide 
order 
dated 
10.06.2019. 
The 
concluding 
paragraph of order dated 10.06.2019 reads as follows:-  
“…But when a person / company needs to 
enter its name in column of ownership in 
revenue record of the concerned revenue 
estate then its entry is being made with 
registration of a mutation subject to payment 
of mutation fee as provided in section 46 of 
the Land Revenue Act, 1967. Therefore, it is 
not simply change of name of the companies as 

Writ Petition No. 40356-2019 
 
3 
 
pleaded free of cost rather a transaction liable 
to payment of usual taxes on the recorded 
value in the revenue record of concerned 
revenue estate by entering a mutation. Hence 
the application of the petitioner for change of 
name of National Sugar Industries free of cost 
as Popular Sugar Mills Limited in revenue 
record is hereby declined to be devoid of any 
legal force. A copy of this order be sent to the 
Assistant Registrar (Writ) Hon’ble Lahore 
High Court Lahore for placing it before the 
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Jameel Khan, the 
Hon’ble 
Judge 
of 
Lahore 
High 
Court 
Lahore...” 
3.  
 
Dr. Muhammad Farogh Naseem, learned 
Senior-ASC has submitted that the respondents have 
failed to understand the legal position that with the 
change of name of the company from “National Sugar 
Industries Limited” to “Popular Sugar Mills Limited”, 
the legal status, rights and obligations of the company 
remained the same; that this aspect was appropriately 
examined vide order dated 21.09.2017 passed by this 
Court in Writ Petition No. 7059 of 2017 in the light of 
the relevant provisions of law and the order dated 
24.11.2016 was set-aside, which has been ignored by 
the respondents; that since, no change of ownership is 
involved with the change of the name of a company, 
therefore, no duty or other charges related to transfer 
of the properties would be attracted to the facts and 
circumstances of the instant case; that the impugned 
order is liable to be set-aside on the ground that the 
properties of the company have not been transferred, it 
is merely a case of change of name of the company 
from “National Sugar Industries Limited” to “Popular 
Sugar Mills Limited”, therefore, no duty / tax would be 
leviable in this case. Learned counsel for the petitioner, 
in course of arguments, has relied on various 

Writ Petition No. 40356-2019 
 
4 
 
judgments including cases titled “Asghar Ali versus P. 
K. Shahani and 2 others”(1992 CLC 2282), “Habib 
Safe Deposit Vault (Pvt.) Ltd. versus Province of Sindh 
through Secretary, Ministry of Revenue and 2 
others”(2015 PTD 1863), “Bhoruka Engineering Inds. 
Ltd. versus The Deputy Commissioner of Income 
Tax”(ITA No. 120 of 2011), “Reckitt Benckiser 
(India) Private Limited versus State of H.P. and 
Ors.”(CWP No. 1293 of 2019), “Inox Air Products 
Pvt. Ltd. versus State of H.P. and Ors.”(CWP No. 
3166 
of 
2016), 
“Bacha 
F. 
Guzdar 
versus 
Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay.”(Civil Appeal 
No. 104 of 1953) and “Cyrus Cowasjee and 2 others 
versus Karachi Metropolitan Corporation through 
Administrator, Karachi”(PLD 2022 Sindh 106). 
4.  
 
Mr. 
Salman 
Asif 
Warraich, 
learned 
Assistant Advocate General has raised following three 
objections:  
(i)  
The properties are under mortgage charge 
of Pak Brunei Investment Company 
Limited and without redemption of the 
charge inclusion of new name in revenue 
record is not permissible; 
(ii)  
The petitioner has alternate remedy 
available to him by assailing the impugned 
order before revenue hierarchy and this 
petition, therefore, is not maintainable; and  
(iii)  The change to the new name of the 
company and the transaction in question 
falls under section 42 of the Land Revenue 
Act, 1967 (the „Act‟), which attracts fee as 
given in section 46 of the Act. 
5.  
 
Heard. The available documents have been 
perused. 

Writ Petition No. 40356-2019

6.  
 
The principle that limited company is an 
artificial legal person, distinct from its shareholders or 
directors, having separate legal personality was 
established in case titled “Aron Salomon (Pauper) Vs. 
A. Salomon and Company Limited” (1897 AC 22, HL) 
and then firmly affirmed by the Privy Council in “Lee 
vs. Lee’s Air Farming Ltd.” (1960 3 All E.R = 1961 
AC 12, PC). The Calcutta High Court in case titled 
“State of West Bengal and Ors. versus Gopi Vallabh 
Solutions Private Limited and Ors.” (CAN 6652 of 
2018 in MAT 869 of 2018) in this regard observed 
that even all the shareholders jointly cannot be said to be 
the company in which they are shareholders and its change 
in name does not bring into existence a new person, which 
as such cannot be construed as transfer of interest in the 
land owned or obtained on lease by the company. The 
relevant paragraph reads as follows:- 
10. 
On the other hand, the decisions cited 
by the respondents/writ petitioners being 
MANU/WB/0113/1966: (2005) 128 Company 
Cases 996 (SCC), AIR 1966 Cal. 585 (DB and 
(1986) 60 Company Cases 707 (DB) clearly 
goes on to show that change in name under the 
provisions of Section 21 of the Companies Act, 
1956 does not bring into existence a totally 
different company and, as such, there can be 
no transfer of the  interest in the plot of land 
under the sub lease which entitles the 
appellants to claim permission fees. The 
change in name prayed for by the respondent 
No. 1/writ petitioner is merely a rectification of 
the lease deed which does not even attract 
payment of stamp duty as in lease. Stamp duty 
at best can be claimed as of deed of 
rectification.  
11. 
It is correct that a company is a juristic 
entity separate from its share holders. The 
company functions of itself through its board of 
directors while the share holders are only 
entitled to participate in the elections and 
receive dividend. All the share holders jointly 

Writ Petition No. 40356-2019 
 
6 
 
cannot be said to be the company as defined 
under Section 3 of the Companies Act, 1956. 
The share holders are also free to transfer 
their shares at will, however, of course subject 
to statutory restrictions and compliance. Even 
with the entire transfer of share holding the 
company continues to exist by its name and is 
liable for any breach of the agreements entered 
into by it. The old company after its change in 
name under the provisions of Section 21 of the 
Companies Act, 1956 continues to exist in the 
new name with all its aspect and liabilities. In 
the instant case, even if the transfer of entire 
share holding of BNK had been transferred in 
2009 it did not amount to a new company 
coming into existence which is different from 
BNK, in fact BNK continued to be liable as a 
sub lessee even after transfer of its entire share 
holding. Any action as to breach of any 
covenant of the sub lessee ought to have been 
brought against BNK till its change in name 
irrespective of who held what shares of and in 
the said BNK. 
12.  
We 
have 
also 
considered 
the 
Memorandum of Articles of Association of 
BNK and GVSPL and have found that there is 
virtually no change between the two which 
could have created a doubt in our mind that 
BNK and GVSPL are different companies. This 
is also not a case where the corporate veil has 
to be lifted to probe into or hold transfer of the 
lease hold interest with the transfer of shares.” 
 
  
 
 
(Underlining is added) 
 
7.             
This Court in case titled “Hira Textile 
Mills Ltd. through Director versus Executive District 
Officer (Revenue), Kasur and 4 others” (2009 CLD 
839) has already adopted the view that a company 
having acted under sections 39 & 40 of the Ordinance 
did not contemplate transfer of any property and 
reached to the following conclusion:- 
  
“As is clear from the contents of this 
petition that the petitioner company has not 
ventured or undertaken any exercise violating 
the exceptions contained in section 17(2) 
because no transfer of immovable property has 

Writ Petition No. 40356-2019 
 
7 
 
taken place, the identity of the petitioner is 
same, therefore, it falls within the exception 
of section 17 of the Registration Act, as such 
it is not required to get any sale-deed 
registered. It also is equally clear that the 
petitioner company acted under sections 39 
and 40 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, 
which do not contemplate transfer of any 
property.”

8.  
 
The effect of change in name of corporate 
entities, under section 40 of Ordinance, has also been 
examined by the Honourable Sindh High Court in case 
titled “Salfi Textile Mills Limited and another versus 
City District Government of Karachi through D.C.O. 
and another” (2013 CLD 2120). It will be beneficial to 
reproduce relevant extract from this judgment, which 
reads as follows:- 
“…A 
company 
incorporated 
under 
the 
Companies Ordinance, 1984 is permitted to 
change its name in accordance with the 
provisions of section 39 ibid; which inter alia 
require a special resolution with the approval 
of the Registrar of the Companies in writing 
bringing the change of its name. The effect of 
such change in the name of corporate entity 
is dealt with in section 40 of the Ordinance 
1984; whenever a special resolution is passed 
by Company with the concurrence of the 
Registrar of the Companies, such change in 
name of the Company is to be recorded in the 
Register of the Company in place of its former 
name and a fresh certificate of incorporation 
with new name is issued. On issuance of 
Certificate of Incorporation with altered or 
new name, the process of change of name of a 
corporate entity is complete. Whenever name 
of a company is changed in accordance with 
section 39 ibid, the company that has changed 
its name is mandated to continue use of its 
former name along with its new name side by 
side for a period of one year from the date of 
issuance 
of 
such 
altered 
certificate 
of 
incorporation. Change in the name of a 
Company does not affect any right or 
obligation of the company nor render 

Writ Petition No. 40356-2019

defective or any legal proceeding by or against 
the company nor rights and interest of 
creditors and or other persons dealing with the 
company in any manner are prejudiced, legal 
proceedings, contract and or transaction as the 
case may be continued or commenced and or 
executed and enforced against the company by 
its former name or by its new name and for all 
practical purposes change of name does not 
affect 
or 
bring 
about 
the 
change 
of 
management and/or transfer of management 
change in name does not bring into being a 
new legal entity it remains the same entity 
merely with a new identity. (See section 40 of 
the Companies Ordinance, 1984). 
  
 
 
(Emphasis supplied)

During the pendency of this petition 
respondent No. 1 approached Board of Revenue (the 
„Board‟) for its ruling on the subject. Vide ruling No. 
1780-2021/0554-LR-I dated 28.01.2022 (the „ruling‟) 
the Board  reached to the opinion that the transaction is 
a sale. Section 39 of the Ordinance permits to change 
name of a company by special resolution and with the 
approval of the Registrar. In the present case, the 
permission was granted by the Registrar and certificate 
dated 13.11.2013 was issued in terms of Section 40(1) 
of the Ordinance. The affect of such change is given in 
Section 40(3) of the Ordinance (the then applicable 
provision) that reads as under:- 
  
“The change of name shall not affect 
any rights or obligations of the company, or 
render defective any legal proceedings by or 
against 
the 
company; 
and 
any 
legal 
proceedings that might have been continued or 
commenced against the company by its former 
name may be continued by or commenced 
against the company by its new name.” 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
A reading of above reflects that change of name does 
not affect any right or obligation of a company. The 

Writ Petition No. 40356-2019 
 
9 
 
affect by change of name on the rights and obligations 
of any company remained unchanged in the current 
legislation on the subject and it has been adopted as 
such in Section 13(3) of the Companies Act, 2017. The 
stance of learned Assistant Advocate General in view 
of mortgage charge or lien of Pak Brunei Investment 
Company, is clearly based on misconception of law. 
He apparently ignored that the rights and liabilities or 
obligation remains unaffected by change of name from 
National Sugar Industries Limited to Popular Sugar 
Mills Limited. It is also not denied by the learned law 
officer that the alleged mortgage charge is on the 
properties and if that is the case then even in cases of 
sale, the mortgage charge always travels with the 
concerned property. Even otherwise, a certificate dated 
15.01.2014 of Pak Brunei Investment Company 
Limited is appended with this petition, stating that it 
has no objection to the change of name. The arguments 
based on charge of the Investment Company are, 
therefore, rejected.  
10.   
Now coming to the next argument of Mr. 
Salman Asif Warraich, learned Assistant Advocate 
General, regarding section 46 of the Act. This 
provision of the Act permits the Board to fix the scale 
of fees for an entry in any record or register under 
Chapter 11 of the Act. The respondents have relied on 
section 42 of the Act in order to convince that the 
change in name of the company in revenue record 
constitutes an entry, as contemplated in the above 
provision. The relevant part of section 42 of the Act is 
as follows:- 

Writ Petition No. 40356-2019 
 
10 
 
42. Making of that part of periodical records 
which relates to land-owners.-  
(1) Subject to the other provisions of this 
Chapter, a person acquiring by inheritance, 
purchase, mortgage, gift, or otherwise, any right in 
an estate as a land-owner, or a tenant for a fixed 
term exceeding one year, shall, within three months 
from the date of such acquisition, report his 
acquisition of right to the Patwari of the estate, who 
shall-  
(a) 
record such report in the Roznamcha 
to be maintained in the prescribed 
manner; 
(b) 
furnish a copy of the report so 
recorded, free of cost, to the person 
making the report; and 
(c) 
send a copy of the report, within a 
week of its receipt by him, to the [office 
of the Union Administration] within 
which the estate is situated. 
 
Language of the above provision reflects that the 
same is applicable on acquiring of any right as land-
owner or a tenant. The words “a person” in section 42 
of the Act further clarifies that the legislature has 
envisaged the acquisition of any right or interest as 
land-owner or a tenant from one person to another. The 
dispute in this case arose when the request was made to 
the revenue department to incorporate the change in 
name of the company from “National Sugar Industries 
Limited” to “Popular Sugar Mills Limited”, which was 
already permitted by the Registrar of the Companies, 
under sections 39 and 40 of the Ordinance. It is already 
discussed in the preceding paragraphs that mere change 
of name does not change the legal status of a company 
or its distinct personality and the said change entails no 
difference to rights or obligations.  
11.  
 
It will not be out place to observe here that 
the “distinct status of a company” or its “separate legal 

Writ Petition No. 40356-2019 
 
11 
 
personality” is subject to exceptions. The same can 
disregard when this shelter is claimed as a mere sham 
or just for the purpose of avoidance of tax. I have 
repeatedly asked the respondents on various dates of 
hearing if the request to incorporate new name of the 
company or any transaction behind it is colorable or 
unreal or sham and if it has been done for just 
avoidance of any tax but the learned Law Officers, the 
Assistant Commissioner and the representatives of the 
revenue department have not adopted this stance.  
12.  
 
Now 
coming 
to 
the 
argument 
of 
respondent-side as to maintainability of this petition as 
well as the availability of alternate remedy. Ms. Samia 
Khalid and Mr. Salman Asif have relied upon cases 
titled “Administrator, Thal Development through EACO 
Bhakkar and others versus Ali Muhammad” (2012 
SCMR 730), “Ghulam Sarwar versus National Bank of 
Pakistan and others” (2007 CLD 530) and “Collector 
of Customs, Lahore and others versus Universal 
Gateway Trading Corporation and another” (2005 
SCMR 37). It is stated that appeal before the relevant 
Commissioner should have been filed. However, I am 
of the opinion that highest revenue authority i.e. the 
Board has already been approached by respondent No. 
1 and the Board has already given the ruling. The 
Commissioner concerned in view of the ruling can 
hardly reach to any different conclusion, thus, the 
alternate remedy indicated before me is not equally 
effectual. Reference can be made to cases titled “Dr. 
Abdul Nabi, Professor, Department of Chemistry, 
University of Balochistan, Sariab Road, Quetta versus  
Executive Officer, Cantonment Board, Quetta” (2023 

Writ Petition No. 40356-2019 
 
12 
 
SCMR 1267) and “Haji Noorwar Jan  versus  Senior 
Member, Board of Revenue, N.W.F.P. Peshawar and 4 
others” (PLD 1991 Supreme Court 531). The 
Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Dr. Abdul 
Nabi case (supra) has held as under:- 
“10.  The extraordinary jurisdiction under 
Article 199 of the Constitution is envisioned 
predominantly for affording an express 
remedy 
where 
the 
unlawfulness 
and 
impropriety of the action of an executive or 
other 
governmental 
authority 
could 
be 
substantiated without any convoluted inquiry. 
The expression “adequate remedy” signifies 
an effectual, accessible, advantageous and 
expeditious remedy which should also be 
remedium 
juris 
i.e. 
more 
convenient, 
beneficial and effective. To effectively bar the 
jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 
199 of the Constitution, the remedy available 
under the law must be able to accomplish the 
same purpose which is sought to be achieved 
through a writ petition…” 
(Underlining is added) 
13.  
 
For what has been discussed above, I am 
of the opinion that application or request to incorporate 
change of name is not a sale as observed by the Deputy 
Commissioner / respondent No. 1, therefore, the order 
dated 10.06.2019 is set-aside.  
14.  
 
Allowed in above terms.
