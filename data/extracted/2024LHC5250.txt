JUDGMENT 
Dates of hearing:  
   09.10.2024 & 11.11.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Mr.

Respondent No.1 by:

Advocate.

General, Punjab. 
 
MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. The petitioner was married to 
respondent No.1 (hereinafter referred to as “respondent”) on 13th 
August, 2018. On account of some differences, “respondent” left the 
house of the petitioner on 24th September, 2022 which prompted the 
petitioner to institute a suit for restitution of conjugal rights. In order 
to resist the suit, the “respondent” submitted her written statement 
wherein she also claimed maintenance. On 21st November, 2023, a 
preliminary objection was raised by the “respondent” with regard to 
maintainability of suit for restitution of conjugal rights on the ground 
that the petitioner is residing abroad and he is precluded to institute 
a suit for restitution of conjugal rights. On the contrary, the petitioner 
also raised an objection with regard to claim of maintenance in 
response to suit for restitution of conjugal rights but while holding 
the suit maintainable, Family Court also observed that claim of the 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-2- 
“respondent” for recovery of maintenance is tenable and adjourned 
the proceedings for 28th November, 2023. On that date, learned 
Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), Chakwal proceeded to fix the 
interim maintenance of the “respondent” which order is now under 
challenge in this constitutional petition. 
2.  
The petition was admitted for regular hearing on 12th 
December, 2023 in response to which, the “respondent” arranged her 
representation on 24th January, 2024 and following order was 
passed:- 
“This petition arises out of order dated 28th November, 2023, 
whereby the learned Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), 
Chakwal proceeded to fix the interim maintenance of 
respondent No.1 (wife) in a suit for restitution of conjugal 
rights instituted by the petitioner. 
2. 
This petition was admitted for regular hearing by way 
of order dated 12th December, 2023 with the following 
observations:- 
“This petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 calls in question the 
vires of order dated 28th November, 2023, whereby the 
learned Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), Chakwal 
proceeded to fix the interim maintenance of respondent 
No.1 in a suit of restitution of conjugal rights instituted by 
the petitioner. 
2. Learned counsel for the petitioner inter-alia contends 
that the petitioner instituted a suit for restitution of 
conjugal rights, which was resisted by respondent No.1, 
who in response thereof claimed maintenance. While 
making reference to section 9(1b) of the Family Courts 
Act, 1964,  learned counsel emphasizes that while 
resisting the suit for restitution of conjugal rights, a wife 
can only make a claim for dissolution of marriage 
including khula but she cannot claim maintenance in 
response thereto. Submits that though to this effect 
specific objection was raised but the learned Judge 
Family Court proceeded to pass the order of interim 
maintenance, which is illegal. 
3. Points raised need consideration. Admit. Notice.

Re-list on 24.01.2024. 
 
 
C.M.NO.1 OF 2023 
5.  
Subject to notice, the proceedings before the 
trial Court may continue,  however, final judgment shall 
not be announced, in the meanwhile.” 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.

3. 
Today learned counsel for respondent No.1 while 
placing reliance on AKHTAR KAMAL versus Mst. SAMREEN 
AKHTAR and 2 others (2018 CLC 887), SHEHERYAR GUL 
versus Mst. SADAF BIBI (2016 MLD 200) and RASHID 
IQBAL versus Mst. UZMA KHAN and 2 others (2010 YLR 
3246) submits that the wife can raise the claim of maintenance 
while responding a suit for restitution of conjugal rights 
instituted by the husband and the scope of sub-section (1b) of 
Section 9 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 is not restricted only 
to the claim of dissolution of marriage including Khula. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the petitioner while 
making reference to schedule part I item 1 contends that the 
import of sub-section (1b) of Section 9 of the Act ibid is 
restricted to clause 1 of the schedule only. 
5. 
Though there are precedents with regard to the matter 
in issue but in my humble view, sub-section (1b) of Section 9 
of the Family Courts Act, 1964 needs deliberation and 
interpretation, especially with regard to the words used make 
a claim of “dissolution of marriage including Khula”.  
6. 
Since matter of interpretation of a provision of law is 
involved, a notice under Order XXVIIA of the Code of Civil 
Procedure (V of 1908) is also issued to the learned Advocate 
General Punjab.  
7. 
In view of previous views of this Court as well as the 
Peshawar High Court which are apparently against the basic 
provision of law, office is directed to place this matter before 
the Hon’ble Chief Justice for constitution of a larger Bench. 
In furtherance to the above, by orders of the Hon’ble Chief Justice, 
the matter is now before us. 
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that a suit before 
the Family Court can be instituted by presentation of plaint in terms 
of Section 7 of The Family Courts Act, 1964 whereas by virtue of 
Sub-Section (1b) of Section 9, a defendant (wife), while resisting a 
suit for restitution of conjugal rights, filed by the husband, may make 
a claim for dissolution of marriage, including khula in her written 
statement, which shall be treated as a plaint. He added that wife 
cannot raise any other claim in the written statement, while replying 
the suit for restitution of conjugal rights, as in the present case. 
Learned counsel emphasized that the interim maintenance of 
“respondent” was thus fixed in transgression of the lawful powers. 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-4- 
Learned counsel contended with vehemence that the impugned order 
is not tenable at all. 
4.  
Conversely, learned Advocate General, Punjab submitted that 
the object of The Family Courts Act, 1964 is to ensure expeditious 
disposal of the family disputes. He added that the procedure provided 
for the trial of the suit in the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) 
cannot be pressed into service in a suit tried under The Family Courts 
Act, 1964. Learned Law Officer, while making reference to Section 
7 of the Act, ibid, argued with vehemence that there is no bar in 
joining all the claims in one suit. While making reference to Section 
9(1b) of The Family Courts Act, 1964, learned Advocate General, 
Punjab submitted that it has wider impact and while defending a suit 
filed by the husband, wife can raise any claim permissible under the 
Act, ibid. It is argued that the aim of The Family Courts Act, 1964 is 
to short circuit the procedural technicalities. In order to supplement 
his contentions, learned Advocate General, Punjab placed reliance 
on Mst. YASMEEN BIBI versus MUHAMMAD GHAZANFAR KHAN 
and others (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 613), Sayed ABBAS TAQI 
MEHDI versus Mst. Sayeda SABAHAT BATOOL and others (2010 
SCMR 1840) and Major MUHAMMD KHALID KARIM versus Mst. 
SAADIA YAQUB and others (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 66). 
5.  
On the other hand, learned counsel for the “respondent” 
submitted that counter claim in maintenance is not prohibited under 
The Family Courts Act, 1964, while resisting the suit for restitution 
of conjugal rights by a wife. It is argued with vehemence that the 
impugned order is unexceptionable. 
6.  
We have heard learned counsel for the parties as well as 
learned Advocate General, Punjab and perused the record as well. 
7.  
The matter in issue stems from a suit for restitution of conjugal 
rights, instituted by the petitioner against the “respondent”, being his 
wife. While resisting the suit, the “respondent” submitted her written 
statement wherein she also claimed the maintenance. Though an 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-5- 
objection was raised by the petitioner before the Family Court that 
“respondent” cannot raise a claim of maintenance, while responding 
suit for restitution of conjugal rights but it was turned down and the 
Family Court by way of the order dated 28th November, 2023 fixed 
Rs.12,000/- as interim maintenance allowance of the “respondent”. 
It would be apposite to observe that though the impugned order is 
interim and ordinarily this Court exercises restraint to interfere with 
the interim or interlocutory orders in exercise of constitutional 
jurisdiction but when some patent illegality is apparently floating on 
the surface of record or petition raises some substantial question of 
law, exercise of constitutional jurisdiction cannot be abdicated. This 
was the reason that the petition was admitted for regular hearing and 
ultimately on account of involvement of important legal question, the 
matter was referred to the Hon’ble Chief Justice for constitution of a 
Larger Bench.  
8.  
At the very outset, we do not feel any hesitation to observe that 
in order to make provision for the establishment of Family Courts for 
the expeditious disposal, settlement and disposal of the disputes 
relating to marriage and family affairs and for the matters connected 
therewith, The Family Courts Act, 1964 (hereinafter referred to as 
“Act, 1964”) was promulgated and enforced w.e.f. 02nd November, 
1965. It is obvious from the preamble of the “Act, 1964” itself that 
its prime object was to ensure expeditious settlement and disposal of 
the disputes relating to marriage and family affairs and the matters 
connected therewith. For carrying out the purpose and object of the 
“Act, 1964”, Family Courts were established in each district by 
virtue of Section 3 of the “Act, 1964”, which were vested with 
exclusive jurisdiction to entertain, hear and adjudicate upon the 
matters specified in Part I of the Schedule of the “Act, 1964”. We 
deem it apt to observe that before promulgation of the “Act, 1964”, 
all such matters were dealt with by the civil courts under the Code of 
Civil Procedure (V of 1908), which was a cumbersome, lengthy and 
tiring process. This was the reason that after the promulgation of the 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-6- 
“Act, 1964” through Ordinance LV 2002, Section 12-A was inserted 
whereby Family Court was bound down to dispose of the cases, 
including suit for dissolution of marriage, within a period of six (06) 
months from the date of institution. To this effect, judgment in the 
case of Mst. Yasmeen Bibi (supra) is of significance importance, 
relevant extract from the same is reproduced below:- 
“9.  
The preamble of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 
1964 is to the following effect: 
  
"Preamble.- WHEREAS it is expedient to make provisions for the 
establishment of Family Courts for the expeditious settlement and 
disposal of disputes relating to marriage and family affairs and for 
matters connected therewith." 
            
In the schedule amended upto date, the matrimonial disputes 
include: 
            
(i) dissolution of marriage [including Khula) 
 (ii) dower 
 (iii) maintenance 
 (iv) restitution of conjugal rights 
 (v) custody of children [and visitation rights of parents to meet 
them] 
 (vi) guardianship 
 (vii) jactitation of marriage 
 (viii) dowry 
 (ix) personal property and belongings of wife 
  
10.       Before promulgation and enactment of the Muslims 
Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, and the West Pakistan Family 
Courts Act, 1964, such matters were dealt with by the Civil Courts 
or Criminal Courts with regard to the maintenance allowance, 
which was a cumbersome, lengthy and tiring procedure. For 
getting the final relief of her grievances, the wife had to wait for 
years for recovery of dower, maintenance and other ancillary 
matters. In cases of dissolution of marriage, it had to consume 
years and after getting the decree by that time, majority of the 
wives had to become grey haired and much beyond the 
remarriage-able age, beside incurring heavy expenses on getting 
the relief with regard to a meager amount of maintenance, dower 
etc. 
It was in the above background that the Legislature felt 
essential to provide for establishment of Family Courts to deal with 
all matrimonial disputes, mentioned above, in an expeditious 
manner, curtailing the life of litigation in such cases. To curb and 
suppress the mischief of delaying tactics on the part of 
unscrupulous husbands, several amendments were introduced to 
the Family Court Act, 1964. Some amendments bearing striking 
features may be cited below:- 
            

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-7- 
"S.12-A. Case to be disposed of within a specified 
period. A Family Court shall dispose of a case, including a 
suit for dissolution of marriage, within a period of six months 
from the date of institution: 
            
Provided that where a case is not disposed of within six 
months either party shall have a right to make an application 
to the High Court for necessary direction as the High Court 
may deem fit." 
            
"S. 17-A. This newly enacted provision was with the object 
to curb the mischief of delaying tactics and the Family Court 
was brought under obligation to pass interim order, directing 
the husband to pay interim maintenance allowance to the 
children and the wife after filing written statement or at any 
stage thereafter." 
            
"The provision of S.21-A was also added to the Family Court 
Act, conferring power upon Family Court to preserve and 
protect any property, which is in dispute in a suit or any other 
property of a party to the suit for the future satisfaction of the 
decree." 
            
To further accelerate and expedite the disposal of such 
cases, the District Appeal Court and the High Court, orders 
staying the proceedings before the Family Court, shall cease 
to be effective on expiring of thirty days time. Again, under 
section 14, through amendment, it was made mandatory for 
the Court of Appeal to decide the case positively within four 
months. 
  
11.       Keeping in view the clear and manifest intention and object 
of the Legislature by drastically amending the provisions of the 
Family Courts Act, a Division Bench of the Peshawar High Court, 
after elaborately dealing with the same held that, "by now, the 
Family Court alone has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with all the 
matrimonial disputes of whatever nature, irrespective of territorial 
jurisdiction, provided that the Family Court where the wife resides 
shall have the jurisdiction to entertain such suits/claims [see. 
Muhammad Tariq v. Mst. Shaheen (PLD 2006 Peshawar 189)]. 
The view held by the Division Bench of the Peshawar High Court 
was not set aside by the Supreme Court thus, the same had 
attained finality and has got strong persuasive effects, which 
cannot be lightly ignored. 
  
12.       Keeping in view the agonies of the parties, particularly the 
wife, in matrimonial disputes to curtail the mischief of delay and to 
shorten the life of litigation in such cases, the Law and Justice 
Commission of Pakistan recommended to the Federal 
Government and all the Provincial Governments to establish 
Family Courts in each District and Tehsil Headquarter, which shall 
be preferably presided over by a female Judge so that the wives 
who are not well acquainted and familiar with the court 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-8- 
proceedings are provided maximum protection and friendly 
environments. 
  
13.       To provide quicker relief to the wife, amendments were 
also made in the relevant provisions, where dissolution of marriage 
is sought on the basis of "Khula", that on failure of conciliation 
efforts made by the Family Court at preliminary stage, the Family 
Court is invested with powers to dissolve the marriage there and 
then, without subjecting the wife to unending litigation. 
  
14.       It is demonstrably clear from these drastic amendments 
made in the Family Courts Act including the new provisions 
added therein, that the Legislature was well aware of the miseries 
and plight of the wives, seeking relief through the obsolete law then 
in vogue thus, to minimize the same not only all matrimonial 
disputes were brought under one and the same umbrella of the 
Family Court but also provided for the target date, both for the 
Family Court and for the Appeal Court, by which such cases shall 
be decided conclusively. The jurisdiction and powers of all other 
courts thus stand excluded in these matters much less Civil Court 
therefore, pushing one or the other party to the Civil Court would 
be in clear violation of the mandatory provision of the law on the 
subject and would amount to reverse the efficacious remedies 
available to them under the new scheme of law.” 
 
9.  
In the case of Sayed ABBAS TAQI MEHDI versus Mst. Sayeda 
SABAHAT BATOOL and others (2010 SCMR 1840), while outlining 
the object and scope of the “Act, 1964”, the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan held as under:- 
“7. It is pertinent to mention here that Family Court had dismissed 
the applications for setting aside ex parte decree on merits as well 
being time-barred as is evident from the orders dated 10-5-2004. 
Similarly first appellate court had dismissed the appeals vide 
orders dated 11-11-2004 on merits. The concurrent conclusions 
arrived by the courts below were upheld by the learned High Court 
vide impugned judgments. It is also admitted fact that provisions 
of Evidence Act and Code of Civil Procedure are not applicable 
qua the proceedings before the Judge, Family Court, in terms of 
section 17 of West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, therefore, 
under West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, the Family Court 
has to regulate its own proceedings in accordance with the 
provisions of this Act and in doing so it has to proceed on the 
premises that every procedure is permissible unless clear 
prohibition is found in law meaning thereby that the Family Court 
can exercise its own powers to prevent the course of justice being 
deflected from the path. Keeping in view the circumstances of the 
case in hand the learned Judge, Family Court, had rightly come 
to the conclusion that service of the appellant/defendant was 
effected in view of the remarks on the registered A/D which was 
sent by the Family Court to the appellant/defendant. The finding 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-9- 
is based on logic. It is also in consonance with Order V, Rule 17 
of C.P.C. As mentioned above C.P.C. is not applicable but the 
Judge, Family Court, is not debarred to follow the principle of 
C.P.C. coupled with the fact that Haji Wali Muhammad Khan, 
Advocate, had appeared before the Court twice who could not 
appear unless and until he had received instructions on behalf of 
appellant/defendant either directly or through his agent which is 
also in consonance with Order III, Rule 4(5), C.P.C. There is, no 
conflict between Order III, Rule 4(5), C.P.C. and provisions of 
West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964. The purpose and object 
to make provision for the establishment of Family Courts for the 
expeditious settlement and disposal of disputes relating to 
marriage and family affairs and for matters connected therewith 
as is evident from the preamble of the said Act. It is settled 
principle of law that Act be read as a whole then it is crystal clear 
that what the Family Courts Act has done is that it has changed 
the forum, changed the method of trial and empowered the court 
to grant better remedies. …” 
10.  
In case of a family dispute, a suit shall be instituted by 
presentation of a plaint or in such other manner or in such court as 
may be prescribed and the plaint shall contain all material facts 
relating to the disputes and shall contain a schedule giving number 
of witnesses intended to be produced in support of the plaint, the 
names and addresses of the witnesses and brief summary of the facts 
to which they will depose. In terms of proviso to Section 7 of the 
“Act, 1964”, a plaint for dissolution of marriage may contain all 
claims relating to dowry, maintenance, dower, personal property and 
belongings of wife, custody of children and visitation rights of 
parents to meet their children. On presentation of  a plaint, a Family 
Court is required to fix a date of not more than fifteen (15) days for 
appearance of the defendant. For this purpose, Section 8 of the “Act, 
1964” is very pertinent. Section 9 of the “Act, 1964” lays down the 
procedure for submission of written statement by the defendant in 
the suit. Sub-Sections (1a) and (1b) are since relevant, so Section 9 
of the “Act, 1964” to that extent is reproduced below:- 
“S.9. (1) Written statement. On the date fixed under Clause (a) of 
sub-section (1) of section 8, the plaintiff and the defendant shall 
appear before the Family Court and the defendant shall file his 
written statement, and attach therewith list of his witnesses 
alongwith a precise of the evidence that each witness is expected 
to give. 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-10- 
(1a) A defendant husband may, where no earlier suit for 
restitution of conjugal rights is pending, claim for a 
decree of restitution of conjugal rights in his written 
statement to a suit for dissolution of marriage or 
maintenance, which shall be deemed as a plaint and 
no separate suit shall lie for it. 
(1b) A defendant wife may, in the written statement to a suit 
for restitution of conjugal rights, make a claim for 
dissolution of marriage including khula which shall be 
deemed as a plaint and no separate suit shall lie for it. 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
Before moving further, we feel it necessary to observe that in order 
to understand the scope of Section 9(1b) of the “Act, 1964”, one 
cannot ignore Section 7 and more specifically its proviso, which read 
as under:- 
“S.7. Institution of suits. (1) Every suit before a Family Court shall 
be instituted by the presentation of a plaint or in such other manner 
and in such Court as may be prescribed. 
(2) 
The plaint shall contain all [material] facts relating 
to the dispute and shall contain a Schedule giving the 
number of witnesses intended to be produced in support of 
the plaint, the names and addresses of the witnesses and 
brief summary of the facts to which they would depose: 
Provided [further] that the parties may, with the 
permission of the Court, call any witness at any later stage, 
if the Court considers such evidence expedient in the interest 
of justice. 
[Provided that a plaint for dissolution of marriage may 
contain all claims relating to dowry, maintenance, dower, 
personal property and belongings of wife, custody of children 
and visitation rights of parents to meet their children and] 
[(3) (i)  
Where a plaintiff sues or relies upon a document in 
his possession or power, he shall produce it in Court when 
the plaint is presented, and shall at the same time, deliver 
the document or a copy thereof to be filed with the plaint. 
(ii).  Where he relies on any other document, not in his 
possession or power, as evidence in support of his claim he 
shall enter such documents in a list to be appended to the 
plaint [giving reasons of relevancy of these documents to the 
claim in the paint. 
(4)  
The plaint shall be accompanied by as many 
duplicate copies thereof including the Schedule and the lists 
of documents referred to in sub-section (3), as there are 
defendants in the suit, for service upon the defendants. 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-11- 
From joint reading of proviso to Section 7 and Sub-Section (1b) of 
Section 9 of the “Act, 1964”, it can safely be inferred that scope of 
latter is not limited or confined but wider enough.  
11.  
To discover the theme of above provisions, we can make 
reference to AKHTAR KAMAL versus Mst. SAMREEN AKHTAR and 
2 others (2018 CLC 887), relevant portion from the same is 
reproduced below:- 
“9.         The apparent intention in promulgating the West Pakistan 
Family Courts Act, 1964 appears to be that it is a beneficial legislation 
enacted for the facilitation of the parties and expeditious justice as 
could be practicable. The insertion of subsections (1a) and (lb) and 
Section 9 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 are one of 
the steps in this direction of speedy justice. It is reproduced for 
convenience as under:- 
S.9.  (1) Written Statement.--- On the date fixed under clause (a) of 
subsection (1) of section 8, the plaintiff and the defendant shall 
appear before the Family Court and the defendant shall file his 
written statement, and attach therewith list of his witnesses 
along with a precise of the evidence that each witness is 
expected to give. 
[(la). A defendant husband may, where no earlier suit for restitution 
of conjugal rights is pending, claim for a decree of restitution of 
conjugal rights in his written statement to a suit for dissolution 
of marriage or maintenance, which shall be deemed as a plaint 
and no separate suit shall lie for it. 
(lb).  A defendant wife may, in the written statement to a suit for 
restitution of conjugal rights, make a claim for dissolution of 
marriage including khula which shall be deemed as a plaint and 
no separate suit shall lie for it: 
Provided that the proviso to subsection (4) of section 10 shall 
apply where the decree for dissolution of marriage is to be 
passed on the ground of khula]

(7) …………………………………………………………… 
            (underlines supplied) 
By the insertion of the above subsection either party may submit their 
claim in the written statement. Though in subsection (lb) of the West 
Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964, the relief of only dissolution of 
marriage and Khula is mentioned as a claim .to be set up by the wife, 
however, in the subsection the word "including khula" is used which 
has enlarged its scope. 
10.       In the case of Emperor v. Jiand and another AIR 1928 Sind 
149, while interpreting the word "includes" the Full Bench held that:- 
"It is well-known rule of interpretation that the word "includes" 
is used as a word of enlargement and ordinarily implies that 
something else has been given beyond the general language 
which precedes it to add to the general clause a species 
which does not naturally belong to it." 
Similarly, in AIR 1932 Madras 474 titled Madras Central Urban 
Bank, Ltd. v. Corporation of Madras, the Division Bench held that.- 
"when it is mentioned that a particular definition 'includes' 
certain things, it should be taken that the legislature either 
intended to settle a difference of opinion on the point or 
wanted to bring in order matters that would not properly come 
within the ordinary connotation of the word or expression or 
phrase in question". 
11.       In the case of Malik Muhammad Inam and others v. 
Federation of Pakistan and others 2006 SCMR 1670, the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan while interpreting the word 'include' or 
'included' in a statute held as under: - 
Where in defining any, the Legislature uses the word 
"included" or "includes", the rule of interpretation is that it is 
used as a word of enlargement and it ordinarily implies that 
something else has been included, which falls outside the 
general meaning of the word. It may also be used to give a 
comprehensive description that includes what is not obvious, 
what is uncertain and what, in the ordinary sense, is not 
impossible." 
            In the case of Mushtaq Ahmad v. The State, 1991 SCMR 
543, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan also commented upon the 
expression "includes" as under:- 
The word "includes" is very generally used in interpretation 
clauses in order to enlarge the meanings of the words or 
phrases occurring in the body of the Statute; and when it is 
so used these words or phrase must be construed as 
comprehending, not only such things as they signify 
according to their natural import, but also those things which 
the interpretation clause that they shall include. But the word 
"include" is susceptible of another construction which may 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-13- 
become imperative, if the context of the Act is sufficient to 
show that it was not merely employed for the purpose of 
adding to the natural significance of the words or expressions 
defined. It may be equivalent to 'mean and include' and in 
that case it may afford an exhaustive explanation of the 
meaning which for the purpose of Act, must invariably be 
attached to these words or expressions. 
12.       Thus merely specifying the word Khula and dissolution would 
not mean that the wife can claim only these two reliefs in her written 
statement but the word "including" used in Section 9(lb) would enlarge 
its scope and the wife is not supposed to file separate suit for 
maintenance and custody of minor etc instead all these claims can be 
joined in the written statement. The word used in the concluding para 
(lb) are also very relevant which support the case of the respondent 
No. 1, i.e. "shall be deemed as a plaint and no separate suit shall lie 
for it" and it further strengthen the case of the respondent No.1, and 
whatever she claimed in her written statement would be considered 
as if she has filed a separate suit to this effect. 
13.       This view also finds support from the case titled Rana Ahsan 
Mahmood Ahid v. Judge Family Court, Faisalabad and 2 others 2010 
YLR 3264 and from the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court 
rendered in the case of "Sheheryar Gul v. Mst. Sadaf Bibi" 2016 MLD 
200. The arguments on this point to the contrary advanced by the 
learned counsel for the petitioner are thus repelled.” 
12.  
Before us, a contention is raised by learned counsel for the 
petitioner that custody matters are entirely different from rest of the 
claims under the “Act, 1964” and Schedule I appended thereto; we 
are mindful of the fact that initially the matter relating to 
guardianship and custody of the minors were to be dealt with by the 
Guardian Courts under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 but such 
matters were later on also made part of Schedule I to the “Act, 1964” 
so as to avoid unnecessary delay and procedural rigors. Guidance to 
this effect can be sought from Major MUHAMMAD KHALID 
KARIM versus Mst. SAADIA YAQUB and others (PLD 2012 
Supreme Court 66). Relevant excerpt from the same is reproduced 
below:- 
“5.    Heard. Prior to the enforcement of Family Courts Act, 1964, the 
disputes, relating to and concerning the family affairs (except 
guardianship etc.) such as the dissolution of marriage, recovery of 
dower, dowery, maintenance, enforcement of conjugal rights and 
jactitation etc. (subject to the amendment of the schedule to the Act 
1964 from time to time) were within the jurisdiction of ordinary civil 
court. Whereas, the issues about the guardianship and custody of the 
minors were the subject matter of the Guardian Courts constituted 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-14- 
under Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. It seems that on account of 
delays, in the adjudication of this class of cases, which possibly was 
due to the complexity of procedure and the rush of work in such 
courts, but undoubtedly was adversely affecting the family union and 
comity, the legislature in order to prevent the above enforced the Act, 
1964. It is so clear from the preamble of the Act that this law was 
enforced with a vivid object to take out the matters falling within the 
ambit thereof from the ordinary regime qua dispensation of justice, 
and for the expeditious disposal of such matters, special forum was 
created in which the rigors of procedural implications and the 
requirements of the Evidence Law (Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984) 
were either dispensed with or were simplified; with an addition of a 
statutory mechanism, enabling the parties for an amicable settlement 
of their disputes, through the courtesy of the Court was provided. 
Therefore, to achieve the aforesaid object, section 5 of the Act, 1964 
conferred 
exclusive 
jurisdiction 
to 
the 
Family 
Court 
to entertain, hear and adjudicate  upon matters specified in Part-I of 
the schedule to the Act. It may be pertinent to refer here, that if the 
original Act, 1964 is examined there were six entries/items to the 
schedule, relating to the matters about dissolution of marriage, dower, 
maintenance,  restitution  of  conjugal  rights,  custody  of  the  childr
en and guardianship. However, these items have been increased 
from time to  time  e.g.  khula'  is  added  to  the  dissolution  cases; 
the  custody issues also involve visitation rights of the parents to meet 
the minors; jactitation of marriage, dowery, personal property and 
personalbelongings  of  the  wife  have  also  been  made  part  ther
eof  and subjected to the jurisdiction of the Family Court. 
Furthermore, Subsections (4) & (5) to Section 1 of the Act 1964 were 
added which read:-- 
"(4). Nothing in this Act shall apply to any suit, or any application 
under the Guardians and Wards Act 1890, pending 
for  trial  or  hearing  in  any  Court  immediately  before  the 
coming  into  force  of  this  Act,  and  all  such  suits  and 
applications shall be heard and disposed of as if this Act were not 
in force. 
(5). Any suit, or any application under the Guardians and Wards 
Act, 1890, which was pending for trial or hearing in any Court 
immediately before the coming into force of this Act, and which 
has been dismissed solely on the ground that such suit or 
application is to be tried by a Family Court established under this 
Act, shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in 
any law, on petition made to it in that behalf by any party to the 
suit or application be tried and heard by such Court from the stage 
at which such suit or application had reached at the time of its 
dismissal." 
Whereas, section 20 confers powers upon the Family Court to 
exercise all powers of Judicial Magistrate of first class under the Code 
of Civil Procedure. Likewise, under section 25 of the Act, 1964, it is 
enunciated "a Family Court shall be deemed to be a District Court for 
the purpose of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, and 
notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, shall in dealing with 
the matter specified in that Act, follow the procedure prescribed in that 
Act". Besides, for the purposes of inter alia the 'territorial jurisdiction' 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-15- 
of the Family Court, the Family Court Rules, 1965 were enforced; the 
Rule 6 whereof prescribes the Court shall have the jurisdiction to try 
a suit will be that within the local limits of which :- 
(a)   the cause of action wholly or in part has arisen; or 
(b)   where the parties reside or last resided together: 
Provided that in suits for dissolution of marriage or dower, the Court 
within the local limits of which the wife ordinarily resides shall also 
have jurisdiction. 
13.  
After having threadbare discussion and going through the 
principles laid down in the precedents noted, hereinabove, we feel 
no reason to differ with the opinion of the Division Bench of 
Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in the case of SHEHERYAR GUL 
versus Mst. SADAF BIBI (2016 MLD 200) to the following effect:- 
“5. Section 9(1) and (2) are relevant to resolve the controversy 
emerged from the impugned order which read as under:-- 
   "9. WRITTEN STTAEMENT" 
  
(1)  On the date fixed under clause (a) of sub-section (1) of 
section 8, the plaintiff and the defendant shall appear 
before the Family Court and the defendant shall file his 
written statement, and attach therewith list of his 
witnesses alongwith a precise of the evidence that each 
witness is expected to give. 
 (2)  Where a defendant relies upon a document in his 
possession or power, he shall produce it or a copy 
thereof in the Court alongwith the written statement". 
 6. After insertion of above provisions of law, the written statement 
had attained the status of plaint. So, as provided in section 7(2) of 
the Family Courts Act that a plaint shall contain all material facts 
relating to the dispute and shall contain a schedule giving the number 
of witnesses intended to be produced in support of plaint, names and 
addresses of the witnesses and brief summary of the facts to which 
they would depose. The proviso to the above section also empower 
the Court to allow either of the parties to call any of the witnesses at 
any later stage if it considers such evidence expedient to the interest 
of justice.” 
14.  
The nutshell of above discussion is that we are of the 
unanimous view that a wife while resisting a suit for restitution of 
conjugal rights can raise any of the permissible claims covered under 
the “Act, 1964” but in such a case the Family Court would be obliged 
to provide opportunity to the husband (plaintiff) to file a rejoinder in 

WRIT PETITION NO.4132 OF 2023.  
-16- 
response thereto, which shall be treated as written statement on his 
behalf. After arriving at this conclusion, we have noticed that though 
the Family Court allowed the “respondent” to raise her claim of 
maintenance while responding in the suit for restitution of conjugal 
rights, filed by the petitioner but without affording the latter an 
opportunity to submit rejoinder, as observed hereinabove and 
proceeded to fix interim maintenance of the “respondent” which 
even otherwise, to our mind, is negation of Section 17-A of the “Act, 
1964”. To this effect there is a consensus amongst all in attendance. 
15.  
On account of above reasons, we allow this petition and 
set-aside the order dated 28th November, 2023 with the direction to 
the Family Court to permit the petitioner to file his rejoinder to the 
claim of maintenance, raised by the “respondent” in her written 
statement and on receipt of the same, if so filed, proceed to fix 
interim maintenance, strictly in accordance with law, with no order 
as to costs.
