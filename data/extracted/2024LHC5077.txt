----------------- 
 
Aalia Neelum, C.J.- The applicant filed an application 
under Section 526 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter referred 
to as "Cr.P.C.”)  for transfer of pre-arrest bail No.851-4/19-12-2023, titled 
“Mian Zaheer Abbas Rabani versus The State” whereby the petitioner 
has sought withdrawal of the pre-arrest bail No.851-4/19-12-2023 in case 
FIR. No.1386/2023, dated 16.12.2023, offences under Section 489-F PPC, 
registered at the police station, City Tandlianwala, District Faisalabad from 
the court of Mr. Muhammad Sajjad Hussain Khan, learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Tandlianwala, District Faisalabad and its transfer to any 
other court of competent jurisdiction at Faisalabad or any other 
Districts/Tehsil Courts.

It was elicited from the arguments of the learned counsel for 
the applicant and the learned Additional Prosecutor General (hereinafter 
referred to as "APG”) to have clarification whether, under section 528(1A) 
(1B) Cr.P.C., the learned Sessions Judge has the power to recall bail 
applications pending in the court of any learned Additional Sessions Judge 

Transfer Application No.10572-T of 2024

to another court in the same District or Tehsil. It was noticed that earlier, 
the Full Bench of this court (Comprising of three members) dealt with an 
identical matter, which was reported as PLD 2020 Lahore 382 titled 
“Naveed Hussain versus The State, etc.” Then, the Honorable Chief 
Justice constituted a larger bench (Comprising four members), and after 
that, the case was heard at length. This is how the instant case comes up 
before a larger bench. The question before this larger bench is referred for 
the decision of whether a Sessions Judge has no power under section 528 
of Cr.P.C. to transfer bail petitions from the court of an Additional Sessions 
Judge to some other competent court within his Sessions division under 
Section 528 Cr.P.C. We are required to answer this question.

The applicant has approached this court under Section 526 
Cr.P.C. for the transfer of an anticipatory bail petition pending adjudication 
before the court of Mr. Muhammad Sajjad Hussain Khan, learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Tandlianwala, District Faisalabad. Section 526 
Cr.P.C. confers power on the High Court to transfer a case or appeal from 
one subordinate Criminal Court to any other Criminal Court of equal 
jurisdiction if it appears that it is expedient for the end of justice. The party 
is interested in transferring a case from one criminal court to another 
criminal court from one district to another and even in the same district. 
Section 526 Cr.P.C. is reproduced hereunder for ready reference: - 
526. High Court may transfer case or itself try it:  
(1) Whenever it is made to appear to the High 
Court:--  
(a) that a fair and impartial inquiry or trial cannot be 
had in any Criminal Court subordinate thereto, or  
(b) that some question of law of unusual difficulty is 
likely to arise, or  
(c) that a view of the, place in or near which any 
offence has been committed may be required for the 
satisfactory inquiry into a trial of the same, or  

Transfer Application No.10572-T of 2024 
3 
(d) that an order under this section will tend to the 
general convenience of the parties or witnesses, or  
(e) that such an order is expedient for the ends of 
justice, or is required by any provision of this Code; 
it may order---- 
(i) that any offence be inquired into or tried by 
any Court not empowered under Sections 177 
to 184 (both inclusive) but in other respects 
competent to inquire into or try such offence;  
(ii) that any particular case or appeal; or class 
of cases or appeals, be transferred from a 
Criminal Court subordinate to its authority to 
any other such Criminal Court of equal or 
superior jurisdiction;  
(iii) that any particular case or appeal be 
transferred to and tried before itself; or  
(iv) that an accused person be sent for trial to 
itself or to a Court of Session.  
(2) When the High Court withdraws for trial before 
itself any case from any Court, it shall, observe in 
such trial the same procedure which that Court 
would have observed if the case had not been so 
withdrawn.  
(3) The High Court may act either on the report of 
the Lower Court, or on the application of a party 
interested, or on its own initiative.  
(4) Every application for the exercise of the power 
conferred by this section shall be made by motion, 
which shall except when the applicant is the 
Advocate-General, be supported by affidavit or 
affirmation.  
(5) When an accused person makes an application, 
under this section, the High Court may direct him to 
execute a bond, with or without sureties, conditioned 
that he will, if so ordered, pay any amount which the 
High Court may under this Section award by way of 
compensation 
to 
the 
person 
Opposing 
the 
application.  

Transfer Application No.10572-T of 2024 
4 
Notice to Public Prosecutor of application under 
this section. (6) Every accused person making any 
such application shall give to the Public Prosecutor 
notice in writing of the application, together with a 
copy of grounds on which it is made, and no order 
shall be made on the merits of the application unless 
at least twenty-four hours have elapsed between the 
giving of such notice and the hearing of the 
application.  
(6-A) Where any application for the exercise of the 
power conferred by this section is dismissed, the 
High Court may if it is of opinion that the 
application was frivolous or vexatious, order the 
applicant to pay by way of compensation to any 
person who has opposed the application such sum 
not exceeding five hundred rupees as it may consider 
proper in the circumstances of the case.  
(7) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect 
any order made under Section 197.  
(8) Adjournment on application under this section: If 
in any inquiry under Chapter VIII or any trial, the 
fact that any party intimates to the Court at any stage 
that he intends to make an application under this 
section shall not require the Court to adjourn the 
case, but the Court shall not pronounce its final 
judgment or order until the application has been 
finally disposed of by the High Court and, if the 
application is accepted by the High Court, the 
proceedings taken by the Court subsequent to the 
intimation made to it shall, at the option of the 
accused be held afresh.  
(9) If, before the argument (if any), for the admission 
of an appeal begins, or, in the case of an appeal 
admitted, before the argument for the appellant 
begins, any party interested intimates to the Court 
that he intends to make an application under this 
section, the Court, shall, upon such party executing, 
if so required, a bond without sureties of an amount 
not exceeding five hundred rupees that he will make 
such application within a reasonable time to be fixed 
by the Court, postpone the appeal of such a period as 
will afford sufficient time for application to be made 
and an order to be obtained thereon.

It may be mentioned here that section 526 of Cr.P.C. is similar 
to the provision of section 528 (1-A) Cr.P.C. Learned counsel for the 
applicant has submitted that the Sessions Judge is empowered under 
section 528 of Cr.P.C. to transfer the bail petitions from the court of 
Additional Sessions Judge to another competent court within his sessions 
division, if it is expedient in the interest of justice and the limitations 
imposed under section 528 (1-A) Cr.P.C. Section 528 Cr.P.C. is reproduced 
hereunder for ready reference: - 
528. Sessions Judge may withdraw cases from 
Assistant Sessions Judge.  
(1) Any Sessions Judge may withdraw any case 
from, or recall any case which he has made over to, 
any Assistant Sessions Judge subordinate to him. 
(1 A) At any time before the trial of the case or the 
hearing of the appeal has commenced before the 
Additional Sessions Judge, any Sessions Judge may 
recall any case or appeal which he has made over to 
any Additional Sessions Judge.  
(1 B) Where a Sessions Judge withdraws or recalls a 
case under sub-section (1) or recalls a case or appeal 
under sub section (1 A), he may either try the case in 
his own Court or hear the appeal himself, or make it 
over in accordance with the provisions of this Code 
to another Court for trial or hearing, as the case may 
be. 
(1 C) Any Sessions Judge may withdraw any case 
from, or recall any case which he has made over to, 
any Magistrate subordinate to him, and may refer it 
for inquiry or trial to any other such Magistrate 
competent to inquire into or try the same. [Inst. by 
Law Reforms Ordi. 1972 Para. 173.] 
Explanation. All Magistrates shall be deemed to be 
subordinate to the Sessions Judge for the purposes of 
this sub-section. 
(2) & (3) ---------[Omitted by Law Reforms 
Ordinance, 1972].

(4) Any Magistrate may recall any case made over 
by him under section 192, sub-section (2), to any 
other Magistrate and may inquire into or try such 
case himself. 
(5) A Magistrate making an order under preceding 
sub-section shall record in writing his reasons for 
making the same. 
(underline and bold by us for emphasis) 
 
 
A thorough examination of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898, reveals that Section 9 empowers the Provincial Government to 
establish courts of session, appoint judges, and direct where such courts 
shall hold their sitting. Section 9 Cr.P.C. is reproduced hereunder for ready 
reference: - 
9. Court of Session. –  
(1) The [Provincial Government] shall establish a 
Court of Session for every sessions division, and 
appoint a judge of such Court.  
(2) The [Provincial Government] may, by general or 
special order in the official Gazette, direct at what 
place or places the Court of Session shall hold its 
sitting; but, until such order is made, the Courts of 
Session shall hold their sittings as heretofore. 
(3) The [Provincial Government] may also 
appoint Additional Sessions Judges and Assistant 
Sessions Judges to exercise jurisdiction in one or 
more such Courts. 
(4) A Sessions Judge of one sessions division may 
be appointed by the 1 [Provincial Government] to be 
also an Additional Sessions Judge of another 
division, and in such case he may sit for the disposal 
of cases at such place or places in either division as 
the 1 [Provincial Government] may direct.  
(5) All Courts of Session existing when this Code 
comes into force shall be deemed to have been 
established under this Act.

From a close reading of the above-said provisions of the Code, 
it becomes abundantly clear that the Code uses the words “court of 
sessions,” “Sessions Judge,” “Additional Session Judge,” and “Assistant 
Sessions Judge” with the difference in their meanings. It is also clear that a 
court presided over by an Additional Sessions Judge is also a court of 
Sessions. The “Additional Session Judge” powers are similar to those of 
the Sessions Judge. The difference is that the Sessions Judge presides over 
the Sessions Court and is the person who can receive the cases, appeals, 
revisions, and all other petitions under the law that the Additional Sessions 
Judge could not receive directly. The Additional Sessions Judge can only 
hear the cases entrusted to him by the Sessions Judge. The Additional 
Sessions Judge has no power under the law to entrust cases to the other 
courts. Sub-Section (4) of Section 17 of the code provides for an 
emergency in which whenever the Sessions Judge is unavoidably absent or 
incapable of acting, he may make provision for the disposal of any urgent 
application by an Additional or Assistant Sessions Judge, or if there be no 
Additional or Assistant Session Judge, by such Judge or Magistrate shall 
have jurisdiction to deal with any such application. Except for this 
provision of law in the Code, no provision makes the Additional Session 
Judge subordinate to the Session Judge. Sub-Section (4) of Section 17 of 
the Code is reproduced hereunder for ready reference: - 
17. Sub-Ordination of Magistrate and Benches to 
Sessions Judge:-  
(1). -----------------  
(3) ------------------ 
(4). The Sessions Judge may also, when he himself 
is unavoidably absent or incapable of acting, make 
provision for the disposal of any urgent application 
by an Additional or Assistant Session Judge or if 
there be no Additional or Assistant Judge, by such 
Judge or Magistrate shall have jurisdiction to deal 
with any such application.

Section 193 of the Code deals with the procedure regarding 
making over the cases to the Additional and Assistant Sessions Judges in 
the sessions division. The said section reads as follows: -- 
193. Cognizance of offences by Courts of Session.- 
(1) Except as otherwise expressly provided by this 
Code or by any other law for the time being in force, 
no Court of Session shall take cognizance of any 
offence as a Court of original jurisdiction, unless the 
case has been sent to it under section 190, sub-
section (2).   
(2) Additional Sessions Judges and Assistant 
Sessions Judges shall try such cases only as the 
[Provincial Government] by general or special 
order may direct them to try, or as the Sessions 
Judge of the division, by general or special order, 
may make over to them for trial. 
(underline and bold by us for emphasis) 
 
 
The provisions quoted above would give a picture of the 
making over, recalling, and transferring of cases within a Sessions 
Division. Section 193 of the Code states that an Additional Sessions Judge 
is to handle only those cases made over to him by the Sessions Judge. 
VOLUME IV, CHAPTER I SUPERINTENDENCE AND CONTROL, 
PART I – GENERAL, PART G --- POSITION OF ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT AND SESSIONS JUDGES of the High Court Rules 
provided that: 
 2. Additional Judge is subordinate to the District 
Judge 
in 
administrative 
matters. 
- 
In 
administrative matters, the position of the District 
Judge is defined in Section 33 of the Punjab Courts 
Act, 1918. Subject to the general superintendence 
and control of the High Court, the District Judge is 
to have control over all Civil Courts under that part 
of the Act and within the local limits of his 
jurisdiction; the Court of an Additional Judge is 
included among such Courts by the earlier Section 
18. It follows that for purposes of administrative 
control such as the grant of casual or other leave, 

Transfer Application No.10572-T of 2024 
9 
appointment of ministerial staff and general 
discipline, the Additional Judge is subordinate to 
the District Judge; and that all correspondence 
with the High Court should ordinarily be 
addressed through the District Judge. 
 
 
The Code does not define the words "Case” and trial used in 
Sub-Section (1-A) Section 528, Cr.P.C.  Above said various provisions of 
the Code indicate that the Code is not confined to the cases in which 
offences only are tried, but includes many other type of proceedings that, 
may not be strictly called as trials of offences, for example, security 
proceedings or maintenance proceedings or bail applications, which can by 
no stretch of imagination be construed as cases wherein offences are tried; 
nevertheless they are essential part of the cases which the Criminal Courts 
try. It goes without saying that ‘case’ comprises various stages, i.e., the 
case at the investigation stage, the case at the inquiry stage, and the case at 
the trial stage; so, the case is not only trial but also other proceedings as 
well, e.g., physical as well as judicial remand of the accused, order on 
application of superdari (سپرداری) of case property, application for bail and 
other allied matters. It is relevant to mention here that at the time of 
deciding the application for bail, the court applies its judicial mind to 
determine whether reasonable grounds are available on the record to 
connect the accused with the commission of an offence and passes a 
speaking order of judicial nature which is termed as “case decided”; in this 
regard, case of “Iqbal Hussain versus The State” (PLD 1985 Lahore 65) 
can be advantageously referred; the relevant portion from the same is 
hereby reproduced:- 
“It is by now well settled that the term ‘case’ does 
not necessarily mean the “whole case” and this term 
is wide enough to include decision on any 
substantial question even though the same is of 
interlocutory nature as distinguished from purely 
formal and incidental order.” 

Transfer Application No.10572-T of 2024 
10
 
 
Similarly, reference can also be had to the case of “Abdul 
Rafiq alias Oassu versus The State” (1994 P.Cr.L.J 2507); the relevant 
portion from the same is hereby reproduced:- 
“The order passed on a bail application is a judicial 
order. The word “Case” is a very wide term which 
would include all the miscellaneous applications 
moved in a case on which a judicial order is to bell 
passed. In the case of Haji Karamat Ali Pandat v. 
Saadat Ali alias Shahadat Ali and others (1955) 7 
DLR 351 it was held that word “case” as used in 
section 192, Cr.P.C. is wide enough to include a 
case under section 193, Cr.P.C. IC” 
 
 
Article 37(d) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 requires inexpensive and expeditious justice to the litigants 
at their doorstep in accordance with law; in this regard, guidance has been 
sought from the case of “Mehboob Hassan versus Akhtar Islam and 
others” (2024 SCMR 757). Even the Legislature, in furtherance of said 
spirit, introduced Section: 439-A Cr.P.C. for providing the remedy of 
revision to the litigants at their doorstep, i.e., at Sessions Court level; 
similarly, Section: 491(1-A) Cr.P.C. was also introduced for providing the 
remedy of getting the order in habeas corpus petitions at Sessions Court 
level; needless to add that Section: 22-A, B Cr.P.C. was also introduced for 
providing remedy to the public at their door step for having issuance of 
direction regarding registration of case, etc.; similarly, Section: 528 (1-A 
and 1-B) was brought on the statute for empowering Sessions Judge to 
recall any case or appeal which he has made over to any Additional 
Sessions Judge before the commencement of trial of the case or hearing of 
the appeal and may try the case in his own court or hear the appeal himself, 
or make it over to another court for trial or hearing. 
4. 
 
It appears from a plain reading of Sub-Section (1-A) Section 
528, Cr.P.C. that at any time before the trial of the case or hearing of the 
appeal has commenced before an Additional Sessions Judge, the Sessions 
Judge may recall any case or appeal which he has made over to him. It, 

Transfer Application No.10572-T of 2024 
11
therefore, follows that the Sessions Judge is not empowered to withdraw or 
recall any case or appeal that he has made over to an Additional Sessions 
Judge after the trial of the case or hearing of the appeal has commenced. It 
is noteworthy that given Section 193 Cr.P.C., an Additional Sessions Judge 
is empowered to try only such cases as the Sessions Judge of the division 
by general or special order makes over to him for trial, and in view of 
Section 409 Cr.P.C., an Additional Sessions Judge is empowered to hear 
only such appeals as the Sessions Judge of the division may by general or 
special order make over to him. The making over of a case for trial or an 
appeal for hearing to an Additional Sessions Judge by the Sessions Judge 
relates to the distribution of business, which is purely administrative. 
Section 409 of the Code is reproduced hereunder for ready reference: - 
Sec 409. Appeals to Court of Session how heard: 
Subject to the provisions of this section, an appeal to 
the Court of Session or Sessions Judge shall be heard 
by the Sessions Judge or by an Additional Sessions 
Judge or an Assistant Sessions Judge:  
Provided that an Additional Sessions Judge shall 
hear only such appeal as the Provincial 
Government may, by general or special order, 
direct or as the Sessions Judge of the Division 
may make over to him:  
Provided further that no such appeal shall be heard 
by an Assistant Sessions Judge unless the appeal is 
of a person convicted on a trial held by any 
Magistrate of the Second Class or Third Class.  
(underline and bold by us for emphasis) 
 
 
The scheme of the Code clearly shows that the exercise of 
power by the Sessions Judge under Sections 193 read with 17(4) of the 
Code is administrative in nature; it is the simple distribution of work. The 
question is how to invoke the power under Section 528(1-A) of the Code. 
Is it open to a litigant to move the Sessions Court for such withdrawal or 
recall? Once there is the source of power as conferred under the Code, one 

Transfer Application No.10572-T of 2024 
12
does not need to labor much as to how to exercise that power. The 
Additional Sessions Judge could reference it, which could be on motion 
made by a litigant. However, the scope of the motion is only for 
administrative convenience. HIGH COURT RULES AND ORDERS, 
(Volume III), CHAPTER 26, TRANSFER OF CRIMINAL CASES, 
PART A. – Transfer of Criminal Cases. 
 
2. Sessions Judges' power to transfer. Under 
section 528 of the Code, Sessions Judges also have 
the general power to withdraw any case from any 
Judicial Magistrate and to refer it for enquiry or trial 
to any other Judicial Magistrate competent to inquire 
into or try the same. 
 
The Sessions Judge may also, at any time before 
the trial of a case or the hearing of an appeal has 
commenced before an Additional Sessions Judge, 
recall the case or appeal and may try the case or 
hear the appeal himself or may make it over to 
another Court for trial or hearing, as the case 
may be.  
Sessions 
Judge 
may 
empower 
any 
Judicial 
Magistrate who has taken cognizance of any case to 
transfer such case for trial to any other Judicial 
Magistrate in his District any such magistrate may 
dispose of the case accordingly. 
 
 
As noted above, one course is under Section 528 (1-A) Cr.P.C. 
for withdrawing, recalling, and making over. However, under Section 528 
(1-A) Cr.P.C., once the trial of the case has commenced or the hearing of 
the appeal has started, the exercise of that power under Section 528 (1-A) 
Cr.P.C. is barred. Should it mean that in such a situation, the only resort is 
the High Court? If so, what is the logical meaning and purpose of Section 
528 (1-A) Cr.P.C.? 
 
 
Section 528 (1-A) Cr.P.C. is related to the power of the 
Sessions Judge to withdraw cases and appeals. This power is conferred on 
the Sessions Judge presiding over the Court of Session. Section 528 (1-A) 

Transfer Application No.10572-T of 2024 
13
Cr.P.C. provides that the power of transferring a criminal case from one 
criminal court to another in the Sessions division is to be exercised only if 
it is expedient for the end of justice. It does not require an elaborate 
discussion to hold that it is a judicial exercise of power. The Additional 
Sessions Judge is not subordinate to the Sessions Judge. But it has to be 
noted that the Additional Sessions Judge gets jurisdiction to deal with a 
case only if such a case or appeal is made over to him by the Sessions 
Judge. Any time before the trial or hearing of the case or appeal, the 
Sessions Judge is also empowered to withdraw such cases. That power 
conferred on the Sessions Judge is meant in the interests of the litigant 
public and also to lessen the burden of the High Court, lest, for every 
transfer of a criminal case or appeal in a sessions division, the litigant 
public will always have to approach the High Court. Since the power under 
Section 528 (1-A), Cr.P.C. is judicially exercised, therefore, reasons are to 
be recorded, any party aggrieved can always take recourse to the remedy 
under Section 526 Cr.P.C. Similarly, under Section 528 (1-C) Cr.P.C. 
Sessions Judge may withdraw any case from or recall any case which he 
has made over to any Magistrate subordinate to him and may refer it for 
inquiry or trial to any other Magistrate competent to inquire into or try the 
same. Since the application for bail in a case is part of the case, therefore, 
before the commencement of the trial, the application for bail pending 
before any Additional Sessions Judge can be recalled by the Sessions Judge 
from the cause list of learned Additional Sessions Judge, and he can hear 
the same himself or make it over to any other Additional Sessions Judge 
for hearing; similarly, before the commencement of trial, Sessions Judge 
may withdraw the case from cause list of learned Additional Sessions 
Judge and he can hear the same himself or make it over to any other 
Additional Sessions Judge for hearing; before hearing of the appeal, 
Sessions Judge may withdraw the appeal from cause list of learned 
Additional Sessions Judge and he can hear the same himself or make it 
over to any other Additional Sessions Judge for hearing. Even in cases 

Transfer Application No.10572-T of 2024 
14
triable by a Magistrate, the application for bail pending before any learned 
Additional Sessions Judge can be withdrawn from said court and heard by 
Sessions Judge himself or made over to any learned Additional Sessions 
Judge for hearing. However, if the trial has commenced, then the case 
cannot be withdrawn from the Additional Sessions Judge by the Sessions 
Judge, and, at that stage the application for bail pending before the 
Additional Sessions Judge can also not be withdrawn, and for that purpose, 
the relevant forum would be the High Court. 
5. 
 
It will also be profitable to draw an analogy regarding the 
exercise of power by the District Court under Section 24 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908. The said section reads as follows: -- 
Section 24 General power of transfer and 
withdrawal:  
(1) On the application of any of the parties and after 
notice to the parties and after hearing such of them 
as desire to be heard, or of its own motion without 
such notice, the High Court or the District Court may 
at any stage---  
(a) transfer any suit, appeal or other 
proceeding pending before it for trial or 
disposal to any Court subordinate to it and 
competent to try or dispose of the same, or  
(b) withdraw any suit, appeal or other 
proceeding pending in any Court subordinate 
to it, and  
(i) try or dispose of the same; or  
(ii) transfer the same for trial or disposal 
to any Court subordinate to it and 
competent to try or dispose of the same; 
or  
(iii) re-transfer the same for trial or 
disposal to the Court from which it was 
withdrawn.  

Transfer Application No.10572-T of 2024 
15
(2) Where any suit or proceeding has been 
transferred or withdrawn under sub-section (1), the 
Court which thereafter tries such suit may, subject to 
any special directions in the case of an order of 
transfer, either retry it or proceeded from the point at 
which it was transferred or withdrawn.  
(3) For the purposes of this Section, Courts of 
Additional and Assistant Judges shall be deemed to 
be subordinate to the District Court.  
(4) The Court trying any suit transferred or 
withdrawn under this section from a Court of Small 
Causes shall, for the purposes of such suit, be 
deemed to be a Court of Small Causes.  
 
 
The Presiding Officer of a District Court is the District Judge. 
The District Judge on the civil side is empowered to transfer any case from 
one Additional District Court at any stage. If so, why should there be a 
restricted meaning for transfer on the criminal side if a provision akin to 
Section 24 (3) CPC regarding subordination is not expressly provided 
under the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898?  Should not that enabling 
provision be read into under Section 528 Cr.P.C. It goes without saying 
that Section 528 Cr.P.C. appears under Chapter XLIV of the Code dealing 
with the transfer of criminal cases and itself is captioned as the power of 
Sessions Judge to transfer cases and appeals from one criminal court to 
another criminal court at any time before the trial of the case or the hearing 
of the appeal has commenced before the Additional Sessions Judge. It has 
also to be noted that the power under Section 528 is to be exercised only if 
it is expedient for the end of justice and not for any other reason. Thus, 
there is a statutory but administrative subordination in making over, 
recalling, withdrawing, and transferring cases, as far as the Additional 
Sessions Judge is concerned, to the Sessions Judge. The power of transfer 
does not always depend on superior jurisdiction. It can also confer power, 
as seen in Section 24 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. Thus, given the 
scheme provided under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 conferring 
power on the Sessions Judge to transfer a case/appeal pending before the 

Transfer Application No.10572-T of 2024 
16
Additional Sessions Judge, the decision in the case titled “NAVEED 
HUSSAIN Versus The STATE and Others” reported as P L D 2020 
Lahore 382, (supra) requires to be overruled and we do so. 
6. 
 
As in the instant case, since the facts and law are intertwined 
in the pre-arrest bail petition, the petitioner is certainly free to move the 
Sessions Judge under Section 528 Cr.P.C. for withdrawing and transferring 
the petition to another Additional Sessions Court so that it can be heard and 
decided. 
7. 
 
With above observations, instant petition stands disposed of. 
8. 
 
The Registrar shall immediately transmit copy of this 
judgment to all Sessions Judges in Punjab for compliance as well as 
intimation to all the Judicial Officers in the Province of Punjab.
