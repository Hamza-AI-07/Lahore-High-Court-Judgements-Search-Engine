Raheel Kamran J:- The appellant/ 
plaintiff has assailed the judgments and decrees dated 
18.11.2021 and 02.09.2022 passed by the learned Civil Judge 1st 
Class, Lahore and learned Additional District Judge, Lahore 
respectively whereby specific performance of agreement to sell 
dated 22.03.2013 was refused, however, defendant No.1 was 
directed to pay double the earnest money to the plaintiff 
alongwith profit at bank rate since 22.03.2013 when the earnest 
money was paid alongwith return of the remaining amount of 
consideration deposited in the Court by the appellant.  
2. 
The facts giving rise to this appeal are that the appellant 
entered into an agreement to sell with respondent No.1 on 
22.03.2013 in respect of plot No.436 measuring 10 Marlas, 
Block-D, Army Welfare Trust Phase-II, Lahore for a 

2 
R.S.A. No.64508 of 2022 
consideration of Rs.1,250,000/-.  The appellant paid a sum of 
Rs.100,000/- in cash as earnest money and the balance of sale 
consideration was agreed to be paid on or before 27.03.2013.  
The plaintiff allegedly made several requests to defendant No.1 
to perform his part of the contract as he was ready to pay him 
the remaining sale consideration, however, he delayed the matter 
on one pretext or the other.  It was further averred in the plaint 
that the plaintiff also deposited all the dues required for transfer 
of the suit property with defendant No.2 and requested 
defendant No.1 to come to the office of defendant No.2 but he 
did not turn up constraining the plaintiff to file the suit.  The suit 
was instituted on 18.09.2014, which was contested by the 
defendant No.1 who filed his written statement.  It was during 
pendency of the suit, that the plaintiff deposited the remaining 
sale consideration on 17.10.2014 on direction of the trial Court.  
Out of the divergent pleading of the parties, issues were framed 
and evidence was recorded.  After consideration of the record, 
learned trial Court, while declining specific performance of the 
agreement, directed defendant No.1 to pay an amount of 
Rs.214,000/- to the plaintiff with 10% annual mark up from the 
date of this judgment till the payment or realization of the 
amount.  Feeling aggrieved, the plaintiff preferred appeal before 
the learned Additional District Judge, Lahore, which was partly 
accepted and by modifying the judgment and decree of the 
learned trial Court directed defendant No.1/respondent No.1 to 
pay double the earnest money of Rs.100,000/- to the plaintiff 
alongwith profit at the bank rate since 22.03.2013 when the said 
amount was paid.    
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant contends that the 
learned Courts below were bound to decree the suit qua specific 
performance inter se the appellant and respondent No.1 
notwithstanding clause-8 in Ex.P-1 providing for payment of 
double the earnest money in case of refusal of respondent No.1 

3 
R.S.A. No.64508 of 2022 
to transfer the property, subject matter of the sale.  In support of 
his contention, he has placed reliance on the case of Muhammad 
Latif Khokhar vs. Abdul Latif Khan and another (2018 CLC 
Note 40) and Mrs. Mussarat Shaukat Ali vs. Mst. Safia Khatoon 
and others (1994 SCMR 2189).     
4.       Conversely, learned counsel for respondents No.2 & 3 
states that there is no stipulation in the agreement to sell to the 
effect that in case of failure of respondent No.1 to perform the 
contract, the same would be specifically enforceable.  Reliance 
in this respect is placed on the case of Muhammad Siddique and 
6 others vs. Abdul Aziz Ratalvi and 7 others (2016 YLR 612) 
(Supreme Court AJ&K).  Respondent No.1 has already been 
proceeded against ex-parte vide order dated 13.02.2023. 
5. 
Heard.  Record perused.    
6. 
The parties entered into an agreement to sell on 
13.03.2013 with respect to a plot measuring 10 marlas against a 
consideration of Rs.1,250,000/- out of which an amount of 
Rs.100,000/- was paid as earnest money and the remaining 
consideration was to be paid on or before 27.03.2013.  There 
was a condition specified in clause-8 of the agreement that the 
seller shall pay double the earnest money if he backs out from 
the sale and likewise if the purchaser backs out, his advance 
money was not to be refunded.  Section 19 of the Specific Relief 
Act, 1877 gives right to claim compensation to the person suing 
for specific performance of contract in addition to or in 
substitution for its breach.  The said section is reproduced 
hereunder for ready reference: - 
“19. 
Power to award compensation in certain cases.  
Any person suing for the specific performance of a 
contract may also ask for compensation for its breach, 
either in addition to, or in substitution for, such 
performance. 
  
If in any such suit the Court decides that specific 
performance ought not to be granted, but that there is a 
contract between the parties which has been broken by the 
defendant and that the plaintiff is entitled to compensation 

4 
R.S.A. No.64508 of 2022 
for that breach, it shall award him compensation 
accordingly. 
  
If in any such suit the Court decides that specific 
performance out to be granted, but that it is not sufficient 
to satisfy the justice of the case, and that some 
compensation for breach of the contract should also be 
made to the plaintiff, it shall award him such 
compensation accordingly. 
  
Compensation awarded under this section may be 
assessed in such manner as the Court may direct. 
  
Explanation.-The circumstance that the contract 
has become incapable of specific performance does not 
preclude the Court from exercising the jurisdiction 
conferred by this section.” 
     
The relinquishment of right to seek specific performance of 
contract is to be decided keeping in view the conduct of the 
parties and evidence led in this respect.  Reliance in this regard 
is placed on the case of Mrs. Mussarat Shaukat Ali vs. Mst. Safia 
Khatoon and others (1994 SCMR 2189).   
7. 
The learned trial Court arrived at the conclusion that it 
was the plaintiff who remained fail to perform his part of the 
contract within time whereas the learned Appellate Court put 
this responsibility on the shoulder of the defendant and 
maintained that the plaintiff was only entitled to recover double 
the earnest money with profit at the bank rate keeping in view 
the condition No.8 of the agreement.   
8. 
It is well settled that the grant of relief of specific 
performance of contract is discretionary in nature which cannot 
be exercised arbitrarily.  The Courts are not bound to grant relief 
of specific performance of contract merely because it is lawful 
to do so.  It is essentially an equitable relief and can be declined 
if the Court reaches the conclusion that it is unjust and 
inequitable to do so.  This principle has been provided in section 
22 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, which is reproduced as 
under: - 
“22. 
Discretion as to decreeing specific performance.  
The jurisdiction to decree specific performance is 
discretionary, and the Court is not bound to grant such 
relief merely because it is lawful to do so; but the 

5 
R.S.A. No.64508 of 2022 
discretion of the Court is not arbitrary but sound and 
reasonable, guided by judicial principles and capable of 
correction by a Court of appeal. 
The following are cases in which the Court may 
properly exercise a discretion not to decree specific 
performance. 
I. 
Where the circumstances under which the 
contract is made are such as to give the plaintiff an unfair 
advantage over the defendant, though there may be no 
fraud or misrepresentation on the plaintiff’s part. 
II. Where the performance of the contract would 
involve some hardship on the defendant which he did not 
foresee, whereas its non-performance would involve no 
such hardship on the plaintiff.” 
 
 
9. 
In the instant case, the agreement between the parties 
contained a specific date i.e. 27.03.2023 for its performance with 
consequences of delay in clause-8 to the effect that in case of 
failure of the seller to perform his part of the agreement, he 
would pay double the earnest money and if the purchaser failed 
to perform his obligation, his earnest money would be 
confiscated. No procedure was provided in the agreement for 
extension of time for performance of the contract. The 
agreement was executed on 22.03.2013 and remaining sale 
consideration was to be paid on 27.03.2013.  A short date was 
fixed for performance of the contract meaning thereby that time 
was essence of the contract.  Now it is to be seen whether the 
plaintiff proved that he had offered payment of remaining sale 
consideration to the defendant.  One of the plaintiff’s witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ilyas (PW-2) stated that on 27.03.2013 he 
and the plaintiff went to the society’s office with the remaining 
sale consideration where the plaintiff contacted defendant 
through telephone whereas the plaintiff (PW-1) stated that 
Muhammad Ilyas did not accompany him to the society’s office.  
The other witness Muhammad Zeeshan (PW-3) deposed that on 
27.03.2013 he was in his house and could not meet the plaintiff.  
Although the witnesses stated that the plaintiff had offered 
balance amount to the defendant yet keeping in view the 

6 
R.S.A. No.64508 of 2022 
contradiction mentioned above, the same cannot be given any 
weight.  Moreover, no bank statement showing balance to pay 
the remaining consideration was produced in evidence.  The suit 
was instituted on 18.09.2014 (after 18 months of the date 
specified for performance of the contract) whereas the remaining 
sale consideration was deposited in the Court on 17.10.2014 and 
that too on direction of the Court.  Having the balance money in 
hand on 17.10.2014 does not mean that the appellant had it on 
27.03.2013.   
10. 
The learned Appellate Court has relied on the admission 
of defence witnesses in their cross-examination regarding 
availability of defendant at Kashmir on the fateful day for 
declaring him liable for non-performance of the contract, 
however, the primary responsibility to show readiness and 
willingness to perform his part of the reciprocal obligation was 
that of the appellant who was seeking the relief of specific 
performance of the contract, which he clearly failed to establish 
in this case.   
11. 
While relying on cross-examination of DW-1, the learned 
trial Court noted that the suit plot was purchased by respondent 
No.1 for Rs.900,000/- in October, 2012 and after five months he 
bargained to sell it for Rs.1,250,000/-.  Only a few days time 
was provided to the appellant for payment of the balance sale 
consideration on 27.03.2013 in the agreement to sell dated 
22.03.2013 for the sale of suit property, which was deposited in 
the Court by the appellant on 17.04.2014.  In the given facts and 
circumstances, the agreement dated 22.03.2013 could not be 
construed to infer consent of respondent No.1 to sell the suit 
property with all its potential for rapid increase in value for the 
payment of consideration of Rs.1,250,000/- to be paid on 
17.10.2014.  Such a construction would give an unfair advantage 
to the appellant over his rival which cannot be countenanced in 
law.  Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of Muhammad 

7 
R.S.A. No.64508 of 2022 
Abdur Rehman Qureshi vs. Sagheer Ahmad (2017 SCMR 
1696). The case law relied upon by the appellant is 
distinguishable on facts.  Accordingly, this Court is of the 
considered opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the 
instant case, discretionary relief of specific performance cannot 
be extended in favour of the appellant.  As regards the relief 
granted to the appellant by the Appellate Court qua payment of 
double the earnest money of Rs.100,000/- alongwith profit at the 
bank rate since 22.03.2013 when the amount was paid, since the 
impugned decree has not been assailed by respondent No.1 
before this Court, therefore, the same is not liable to any 
interference.   
12. 
For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is dismissed.  
There shall be no order as to costs.
