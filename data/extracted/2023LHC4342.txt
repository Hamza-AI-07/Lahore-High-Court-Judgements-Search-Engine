    03.03.2023 
For Petitioner: 
Mr Jawwad Khan Lodhi, Advocate, with 
Syed Samir Sohail and Ahmad Khan Niazi, 
Advocates. 
For Respondents No.1, 2 & 4: 
Mr A. D. Naseem, Deputy Attorney General, 
with Zafar Iqbal Bhutta, Deputy Secretary, 
Ministry of Industries & Production. 
For Respondents No.3 & 5: 
Mr Umer Javed, Advocate, with Muhammad 
Arif Chaudhry, Deputy General Manager 
SMEDA. 
 
 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Small and Medium 
Enterprises Development Authority – SMEDA – (Respondent No.3), an 
autonomous organization under the Federal Government, has been 
established under Ordinance XXXIX of 2002. Its mission is “to provide 
requisite support services for encouraging and facilitating the development 
and growth of small and medium enterprises in Pakistan by way of policy-
making and through the provision of resources and support services.” It 
works under the Ministry of Industries and Production (MoIP). On 
14.1.2020, the Federal Government appointed the Petitioner as the Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) of SMEDA on a three-year contract under section 
12(1) of the Ordinance. On the expiry of his term, the Government 
appointed Respondent No.5 as the CEO, vide Notification No. PF.(683) 
E-5(PAS) dated 13.1.2023 (the “Impugned Notification”). The Petitioner 
has challenged the appointment of Respondent No.5 in this petition under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(the “Constitution”), and seeks a directive to the Federal Government to 
consider an extension of his service in accordance with section 12(2) of the 
Ordinance due to his “exemplary performance.” 

Writ Petition No. 2528/2023

2. 
 
Mr Jawwad Khan Lodhi, Advocate, contends that the Federal 
Government has appointed Respondent No.5 as CEO of SMEDA without 
following the procedure outlined in section 7(xxvii) of the Ordinance, read 
with Rule 8 of the SMEDA Employees Service Rules 2015, and the 
Guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan 
(SECP). Therefore, he argues, the Impugned Notification is void ab initio. 
He further contends that, according to section 11(3) of the Ordinance, the 
Chairman of SMEDA’s Board of Directors is the competent authority to 
review the CEO’s performance. He submitted his case for the extension of 
tenure and apprised him that SMEDA was one of the best-performing 
entities in the financial year 2021-22. Resultantly, the Petitioner’s case was 
placed on the agenda of the Board’s 22nd Meeting, and this fact was also 
intimated to the MoIP vide letter dated 10.10.2022. However, the Board 
could not meet because the six private members required by its constitution 
had not been nominated. Mr Lodhi contends that he has a right to be 
considered before any new appointments are made to the office. 
3. 
 
Mr A. D. Naseem, Deputy Attorney General, maintains that 
the Federal Government has the exclusive mandate under section 12 of the 
Ordinance to designate the CEO of SMEDA. The Board’s role is limited to 
making recommendations that are not legally binding. According to the 
learned Law Officer, the appointment of Respondent No.5 is valid, and no 
exception can be taken thereto. As regards the Petitioner’s request for  
re-appointment as CEO, he contends that a contractual employee has no 
vested right which he can get enforced through a constitutional petition. 
Even otherwise, his performance has been dismal, and the Federal 
Government has no desire to re-appoint him. 
4. 
 
The counsel for Respondent No.5, Mr Umar Javed, Advocate, 
has adopted the arguments of the Deputy Attorney General. He adds that 
Respondent No.5 is an experienced officer, having served in various key 
posts and thus qualified for the office of CEO of SMEDA. 
Determination 
5. 
 
To appreciate the contentions of the learned counsel, it is 
necessary to look at the legal provisions regarding the appointment of 
SMEDA’s CEO. Chapter V of the Ordinance deals with this subject. 
Section 12(1) provides that the Federal Government shall appoint him 

Writ Petition No. 2528/2023 
 
 
 
- 3 - 
subject to such terms and conditions as it may determine. Section 12(2) 
states that the CEO shall be appointed for a term of three years which may 
be extended for a maximum of one additional term not exceeding three 
years. Section 13 sets out the qualifications for that office, whereas section 
14 outlines the disqualifications. 
6. 
 
In the exercise of the powers conferred by section 36 of the 
Ordinance, 
the 
Federal 
Government 
has 
framed 
the 
SMEDA  
(Employees Service) Rules, 2015 (the “Rules”). Rule 4(1) stipulates that 
subject to provisions of sections 12, 13 and 14 of the Ordinance, the 
Federal Government shall appoint the CEO on the recommendation of the 
Board as provided in section 7 (xxxvii) thereof.1 Rule 8 adds that the CEO 
shall be selected from among the persons having knowledge and at least 18 
years of post-qualification relevant experience and possessing a 
Masters/Bachelors Degree (minimum sixteen years of education) in 
Business 
Administration, 
Management, 
Marketing 
H.R., 
Public 
Administration, Public Policy, Economics & Engineering, Finance & 
Accounts, Law, Social Science or equivalent from a reputable foreign or 
HEC recognized institute/university. 
7. 
 
Section 6 of the Ordinance describes the composition of 
SMEDA’s Board. It comprises 12 members, out of which six are ex officio 
directors, including the Federal Minister for Industries and Production as 
Chairman, Secretary Industries and Production Division, Secretary Finance 
Division, Secretary Commerce Division, Chairman FBR and CEO 
SMEDA. The remaining six members of the Board are appointed from the 
private sector who fulfil the eligibility criteria specified in section 6(1)(g) 
of the Ordinance. The Board is responsible for executive control of 
SMEDA. Section 37 of the Ordinance empowers the Board to make 
regulations that are not inconsistent with the Rules, and to provide for all 
matters for which provision is necessary or expedient for carrying out the 
purposes and provisions of the Ordinance. In exercising those powers, the 
Board has framed SMEDA Employees Performance, Promotion and 
                                          
1 Section 7 (xxxvii) of the Ordinance reads as under: 
7. 
Powers and functions of the Board.– Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, the 
Board shall–  
(xxxvii) recommend suitable persons for the appointment as the Chief Executive Officer.

be followed for naming the CEO. 
8. 
 
It is pertinent to note that the SECP has issued the Public 
Sector Companies (Appointment of Chief Executive), Guidelines, 2015.2 
They apply to all Public Sector Companies,3  which must also comply with 
any special law related to their business activity, including the provisions 
for the Chief Executive’s appointment, fitness, and propriety, as long as 
they are not inconsistent with their enabling law or enactment. 
9. 
 
In the present case, SMEDA has no Board in accordance with 
section 6 of the Ordinance because the six private members have not been 
nominated. As a result, the Board made no recommendations, and the 
Federal Government appointed Respondent No.5 without them. The 
purpose of regulating the appointment process of CEOs in public sector 
companies is to promote merit and good governance and eschew 
favouritism and nepotism. In Muhammad Ashraf Tiwana and others v. 
Pakistan and others (2013 SCMR 1159), the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
held: 
“We wish to add that issues of appointments to senior positions in public 
bodies, which have been highlighted in this petition and in other cases 
which have come up before us, have underscored the need for a 
transparent, inclusive and demonstrably fair process for the selection of 
persons to be appointed to such senior positions. The Federal 
Government may consider the necessity of putting in place independent 
mechanisms and of framing open, fair and transparent processes so that 
the objectives for which public bodies are established can be efficiently 
achieved and, at the same time, the pernicious culture of arbitrariness, 
favouritism and nepotism is eliminated.” 
The Supreme Court further stated: 
“It has by now become well settled that Courts will look into the process 
of appointments to public office. It is the process which can be judicially 
reviewed to ensure that the requirements of the law have been met. In the 
case of Muhammad Yasin4, the process of appointment to public office 
has been made the subject of judicial review to ensure adherence to the 
command of the law. This is also a requirement of good governance and 
                                          
2 SECP has issued these Guidelines under section 506B of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, read with 
Rule 5(2) of the Public Sector Companies (Corporate Governance) Rules, 2013. 
3 Rule 2(1)(g) of the Public Sector Companies (Corporate Governance) Rules, 2013 states: 
“Public Sector Company” means a company, whether public or private, which is directly or 
indirectly controlled, beneficially owned or not less than fifty one percent of the voting securities 
or voting power of which are held by the Government or any instrumentality or agency of the 
Government or a statutory body, or in respect of which the Government or any instrumentality or 
agency of the Government or a statutory body, has otherwise power to elect, nominate or appoint 
majority of its directors, and includes a public sector association not for profit, licensed under 
section 42 of the Act.

has been a subject of comment from ancient times. Abu al-Hassan al-
Mawardi (d. 1058 A.D), the famous scholar from Baghdad devoted a 
substantial portion of his 11th century treatise on constitutional law, the 
al-Ahkam al Sultaniyyah, to the qualifications for holding public office. 
These are universal principles of good governance and are reflected in 
sections 5 and 6 of the Act, which lay down stringent criteria for the kind 
of 
person 
the 
Federal 
Government 
may 
appoint 
as 
Commissioner/Chairman SECP. Section 5(1) of the Act specifies that a 
Commissioner ‘shall be a person who is known for his integrity, 
expertise, experience and eminence in any relevant field, including the 
securities market, law, accountancy, economics, finance, insurance and 
industry.’ Under the law, the Federal Government has the authority to 
appoint the Chairman and Commissioners of SECP. The Federal 
Government, however, has no absolute and unbridled powers in this 
behalf. It is constrained by the aforesaid requirements of the Act. We 
have come a long way from the days of the whimsicality of Kings and 
Caesers, such as Caligula, who could conceive of appointing his horse 
Incitatus as Consul of Rome. The element of subjectivity and discretion 
of the Government has been severely limited by the legal requirement 
that an appointee must be a person having integrity, expertise, eminence 
etc. This requirement imposes a duty on the Federal Government to put 
in place a process which ensures that the requirements of the law are 
met.” 
10. 
 
In Ghulam Rasool v. Government of Pakistan and others 
(PLD 2015 SC 6), the Supreme Court held: 
“…the matter of appointment of heads of statutory bodies, 
autonomous/semi-autonomous 
bodies, 
corporations, 
regulatory 
authorities, etcetera are governed under specific statutory provisions 
which cannot be overlooked or substituted by some other mechanism. 
We have noted that various Acts/Ordinances lay down specific criteria/ 
qualifications for high-level appointments and empower the Federal 
Government to make such appointments.” 
11. 
 
Sections 12, 13 and 14 of the Ordinance read with section 7 
(xxxvii) thereof and Rule 4(1) and Regulation 16 are mandatory. The 
Board has an important role in appointing a CEO, and its recommendations 
are vital. In Human Rights Case No. 11827-S of 2018 (In the matter 
regarding the Selling of National Assets, including PIA, at Throwaway 
Price) (2019 SCMR 1952), the Supreme Court held: 
“24. 
Until and unless strict compliance with the provisions of the 
statute and rules governing appointment to these senior positions are 
adhered to in letter and spirit, such appointments will always be 
subject to challenge on the ground of arbitrariness and non-
compliance with the law and settled principles. It cannot be stressed 
enough that the Board of Directors is a body that owes a fiduciary 
duty to the stakeholders of the company, and its role, as explained 
above, is not of a mere bystander. The role of the Board envisaged by 
law is central and pivotal, and has clearly been articulated in the 
Rules, 2013 whereby the Board has an active duty to safeguard the 
rights of its stakeholders. Such duty needs to be performed by 
employing independent and honest individuals with training and 
experience in the relevant field, with the highest level of integrity, 
probity and honesty.”

The Impugned Notification gives the impression that it is a 
routine transfer of an officer (Respondent No.5) awaiting posting in the 
Establishment Division to SMEDA as its CEO. Moreover, it does not 
mention his tenure and says the transfer/appointment is “with immediate 
effect and until further orders.” As per section 12(2) of the Ordinance, the 
CEO’s appointment has to be for three years. It is trite that when the law 
requires a thing to be done in a particular manner, it must be done in that 
manner and not otherwise.5 In Federation of Pakistan and another v.      
E-Movers (Pvt.) Limited and another (2022 SCMR 1021), the Supreme 
Court held: 
“The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (the 
‘Constitution’) is the fountainhead of the rule of law in Pakistan. ‘To 
enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law is 
the inalienable right of every citizen.’ The rule of law constitutes the 
bedrock of governance. When the law stipulates that something has to 
be done in a particular manner, that is how it should be done. And any 
person who exercises authority must do so in accordance with law. 
The right to be treated in accordance with law was invigorated and 
bolstered when the Constitution was amended to provide an additional 
Fundamental Right by adding Article 10A to the Constitution 
stipulating that, ‘For the determination of his civil rights and 
obligations or in any criminal charge against him a person shall be 
entitled to a fair trial and due process.’ The due process requirement 
must be met in the determination of rights and obligations. The 
Constitution does not define the due process. Therefore, it would not 
be appropriate to limit its scope by defining it. But this does not mean 
that the due process requirement is a meaningless concept. Rather, 
due process incorporates universally accepted standards of justice and 
is not dependent upon any law or laws. It is an all-encompassing 
expression which may not be curtailed with reference to particular 
laws. Due process is to be understood holistically by keeping in mind 
the 
entire 
Constitution, 
which 
excludes 
arbitrary 
power, 
authoritarianism and autocratic rule.” 
13. 
 
In view of the above, the appointment of Respondent No.5 as 
the CEO of SMEDA is declared to be without lawful authority and of no 
legal effect. The Impugned Notification dated 13.1.2023 is set aside. 
14. 
 
The Petitioner wishes to be considered for a second term as 
CEO under section 12(2) of the Ordinance. The Deputy Attorney General 
states that the Federal Government is not interested in him because of 
several complaints against him. He has placed on record copies of some of 
them. Admittedly, the Petitioner retired on 13.1.2020 after completing his 
                                          
5 Also see: Human Rights Case Nos. 4668 of 2006, 1111 of 2007 and 15283-G of 2010 in the matter of 
Action taken on news clippings regarding Fast Food outlet in F-9 Park, Islamabad (PLD 2010 SC 759); 
Shahida Bibi and others v. Habib Bank Limited and others (PLD 2016 SC 995); Muhammad Hanif 
Abbasi v. Imran Khan Niazi and others (PLD 2018 SC 189); Ajmir Shah v. The Inspector General, 
Frontier Corps Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and another (2020 SCMR 2129); and Wajid Ali Shah v. Election 
Commission of Pakistan and 13 others (2022 CLC 1507).

three-year tenure. He has no vested right to claim an extension if the 
competent authority is not interested owing to legitimate or justifiable 
reasons. Reference may be made to Jawad Ahmad Mir v. Dr. Imtiaz Ali 
Khan and others (2023 SCMR 162). 
15. 
 
It is also well-settled that an employee cannot seek an 
extension of his contract in a constitutional petition. Reliance is placed on 
Khushal Khan Khattak University and others v. Jabran Ali Khan and 
others (2021 SCMR 977); Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 
others v. Intizar Ali and others (2022 SCMR 472); and Jawad Ahmad Mir 
v. Dr. Imtiaz Ali Khan and others (2023 SCMR 162). 
16. 
 
In the result, Respondent No.1 cannot be issued the direction 
the Petitioner has prayed for. 
17. 
 
SMEDA is without a functional Board – and a CEO – which is 
likely to impact its operations. Respondent No.1 is directed to take 
immediate steps to fill the vacancies on the Board. Following that, it shall 
proceed for the appointment of the CEO. 
18. 
 
This petition is disposed of in the above terms.
