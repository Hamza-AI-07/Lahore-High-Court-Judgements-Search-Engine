Vs. 
Judicial Magistrate Section, 30, 
Multan and others 
Sr. No. of

Date of order/ 
Proceeding 
Order with signature of Judge, and that of 
Parties’ counsel, where necessary 
 
23.12.2024 Mr. Shahbaz Ali Khan Gurmani, Advocate for 
appellant. 
Mr. Bashir Ahmad Buzdar, A.A.G. 
Mr. Muhammad Ashraf Sindhu, Advocate for 
respondent. 
 
 
 
 
The appellant is aggrieved of dismissal of 
his constitution petition by the learned Single 
Judge in chambers, who declined to interfere in 
the order dated 31.03.2023 passed by the learned 
Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Multan whereby 
he had discharged the respondent No.4, who was 
accused in F.I.R. No.1919 of 2021 dated 
14.12.2021 registered under Section 489-F P.P.C. 
at P.S. Muzaffarabad, Multan, by claiming that as 
the investigation of the case had already been 
transferred, said order to discharge the accused on 
the basis of the report of the Investigating Officer 
from whom the investigation had been transferred 
was not justified. 
2. 
The learned counsel for the respondent No.4 
has defended the said orders on legal and factual 
grounds. On the other hand, the learned Law 
Officer states that he has no objection to the 
setting aside of the order of discharge of the 
accused for the reason that the Investigating 
Officer to whom the investigation had been 
transferred is investigating the matter, which is 
permissible despite discharge of accused. 
3. 
The perusal of the impugned order shows 

ICA No. 292 of 2024 
 
2 
 
that the learned Single Judge had declined to 
interfere in the impugned discharge order passed 
by the learned Judicial Magistrate for the reason 
that the appellant had already filed a private 
complaint for the same offence, in which the 
respondent No.4 had already been summoned to 
face trial and in any case in terms of principles 
laid down in the case titled “Nur Elahi Vs. The 
State and others” (PLD 1966 SC 708) the trial 
court had to proceed with the private complaint in 
preference to the State case. 
4. 
On this the learned counsel for the appellant 
states that on the one hand it is claimed that 
accused has been summoned for trial in the private 
complaint case and on the other hand Investigating 
Officer has initiated proceedings against the 
appellant under Section 182 P.P.C. which is not 
justified.  
5. 
When confronted, learned Law Officer 
states that proceedings under Section 182 P.P.C. 
would not be initiated against the appellant before 
finalization of the private complaint filed by him 
before the Court, which statement is in accordance 
with principles laid down in judgments reported 
“M.J.A. Gazdar Vs. The State” (1989 MLD 1694), 
“Ashfaq Ali Vs. The State” (PLD 1975 Karachi 
87) and “Muhammad Murad Vs. The State” (1983 
P.Cr.L.J. 1097) wherein it is provided that during 
pendency of complaint case, proceedings under 
Section 182 P.P.C. in a criminal case relating to 
same subject matter cannot be initiated, which 
legal position is also not disputed by learned 
counsel for respondent No.4. 
6. 
It is important to note here that in view of 
the principles laid down in judgments reported as 

ICA No. 292 of 2024 
 
3 
 
“Mian Muhammad Asif Vs. S.S.P. Operation, 
Lahore and 02 others” (2010 YLR 944), “Habib 
Ur Rehman and others Vs. The State” (1999 MLD 
860), “Ashiq Hussain Vs. Sessions Judge, Lodhran 
and 3 others” (PLD 2001 Lahore 271) and 
“Muzafar Ahmad Vs. The State and 02 others” 
(2021 P.Cr.L.J. 1393) despite discharge order 
police authorities may reinvestigate the matter 
which is already being done in the instant case as 
per statement made by the learned Law Officer 
hence, no further order is required to be passed in 
this appeal as the impugned order passed by the 
learned Single Judge does not suffer from any 
illegality and jurisdictional defect for this Court to 
warrant interference and in view thereof, this Intra 
Court Appeal is disposed of accordingly.
