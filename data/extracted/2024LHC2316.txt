02)    16.05.2024 
Barrister Shahzad Shabbir for the petitioner.  
 
Sardar Muhammad Ameer Hamza Dogar, Assistant Attorney General 
for the Federation of Pakistan (on Court’s call) assisted by Nadeem 
Aamir, Deputy Director (Law), Federal Investigation Agency, 
Lahore.   
 
Mr. Idrees Rafique Bhatti, Assistant Advocate General, Punjab along 
with M/s Nuzhat Bashir and Haroon Rasheed, Deputy Prosecutors 
General for the State (on Court’s call).  
 
  
Since question of deciding jurisdiction with respect to taking 
cognizance and conducting trial of the case between the Courts of two districts is 
involved in the under-objection petition therefore objection raised by the office is 
overruled.  Office is directed to allot number to this petition and fix the same for

Writ Petition No.30611/2024 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that case arising out of 
F.I.R. No.145/2024 was registered against the petitioner under Section: 462-J PPC 
at Police Station: F.I.A., Circle, Gujrat; application for petition for post arrest bail 
was filed by the petitioner in the case before Sessions Courts, Gujrat, which was 
entrusted to the Court of learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Gujrat and was dismissed 
as withdrawn due to territorial jurisdiction vide order dated: 06.05.2024 passed by 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Gujrat (copy of said application and order are 
available at Pages No.5 to 8 of instant petition); relevant portion of the order is 
hereby reproduced as under: - 
“In view of above recorded statement of Qasim Ali Advocate 
learned counsel for the petitioner/accused Reyasat Ali in case FIR 
No.145/2024, offence u/s 462-J, P.S FIA Gujrat, it is noted that 
the offence of this case had occurred in the territorial jurisdiction 
of district M.B.Din, so this court has no jurisdiction to entertain 
instant post-arrest bail petition and petitioner is allowed to file 
the same before the court of competent jurisdiction. Consequently, 
this post-arrest bail petition is dismissed as withdrawn.” 
 
Then petitioner filed application for post arrest bail in the case in the Court of 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Phalia, which was ordered to be returned due to 
territorial jurisdiction vide order dated: 07.05.2024 passed by learned Addl. 

                       Diary No.68328 dated: 13.05.2024 
               Writ Petition No.30611/2024  
  
   2 
 
Sessions Judge, Phalia (copy of said application and order are available at Pages 
No.9 to 11 of instant petition) and relevant portion of the order is hereby 
reproduced below: - 
“5.  It is an admitted fact that this FIR has been registered at 
Police Station FIA, Circle Gujrat by the concerned officer of the 
FIA authority. The Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Phalia has 
not been vested with any power to deal with the cases registered 
at Police Station FIA and is only entertaining and hearing the 
cases registered at local Police Station. As stated by learned 
counsel, the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Gujrat 
was previously dealing with the cases registered at Police Station 
FIA. Because of bar of territorial jurisdiction relating to cases 
registered at Police Station FIA, this Court has no jurisdiction to 
entertain the post arrest bail application. The same may, 
therefore, be returned to the learned counsel for petitioner, so 
that the same may be presented before the Court of competent 
jurisdiction.”  
 
Learned counsel further adds that in aforementioned circumstances, petitioner is 
unable to find out the Court having territorial jurisdiction to entertain and decide 
the petition for bail, hence, instant petition has been filed before this Court.  
2.  
 
Points raised need consideration.  
3.  
 
Notice to the State/respondent No.1. 
4. 
 
Learned Assistant Attorney General assisted by Deputy Director 
(Law), F.I.A., Lahore as well as learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab and 
learned Deputy Prosecutors General (present in Court) have accepted the notice on 
behalf of the State and expressed their willingness to argue this petition today; 
therefore, instant petition is being decided as “Notice Case”.  
5.   
 
Brief however necessary facts for deciding instant petition are that 
case vide F.I.R. No.145/2024 dated: 02.05.2024 was registered against present 
petitioner under Section: 462-J PPC at Police Station: F.I.A., Circle: Gujrat (copy 
of F.I.R. is available at Page No.4 of instant petition) and place of occurrence in 
Column No.4 of said F.I.R. has been mentioned as “Pahrianwali, Mandi 
Bahauddin” (ہ پا
ڑیانوالی
، منڈی بہا
ن ادی و); petitioner filed application for post arrest bail 
in the case in Sessions Courts, Gujrat, which was entrusted to the Court of learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Gujrat however same was dismissed as withdrawn from 
said Court due to lack of territorial jurisdiction in order to file application for bail 
before the Court of competent jurisdiction (as detailed above); then, petitioner filed 
application for post arrest bail before the Court of learned Additional Sessions 
Judge, Phalia, which was also ordered to be returned to the petitioner due to bar of 
territorial jurisdiction vide order dated: 07.05.2024 passed by learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Phalia (as mentioned above); hence, instant petition has been filed 
before this Court.  

                       Diary No.68328 dated: 13.05.2024 
               Writ Petition No.30611/2024  
  
   3 
 
6.   
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in aforementioned 
state of affairs, petitioner is not certain about the Court which has territorial 
jurisdiction to entertain the application for bail as well as to take cognizance of the 
offence and conduct trial of the case. Learned counsel finally prays for declaring 
the relevant Court in this regard.  
7.   
 
Learned Assistant Attorney General assisted by Deputy Director 
(Law), F.I.A., Lahore submits that Police Station: F.I.A., Circle: Gujrat has 
territorial jurisdiction with respect to registration of cases, investigation of cases as 
well as inquiring into the offences mentioned in schedule of the Federal 
Investigation Agency Act, 1974, in District: Gujrat as well as in the area of District: 
Mandi Bahauddin (copy of notification reflecting said jurisdiction has been 
produced by him, which has been placed on the record); further adds that Federal 
Investigation Agency is only meant for the purpose of investigating scheduled 
offences as well as inquiring into the same and the Federal Investigation Agency 
Act (ibid) does not contain any specific provision about the Court for the purpose 
of trial of the case regarding said offences.  
8.  
 
Learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab while supporting 
aforementioned arguments advanced by learned Assistant Attorney General adds 
that though offences including mentioned in the schedule of the Federal 
Investigation Agency Act, 1974 are to be investigated and inquired into by the 
Federal Investigating Agency only yet said “Act” has not been legislated for the 
purpose of deciding Court for trial.  
9.  
 
Learned Deputy Prosecutors General while adopting aforementioned 
arguments of learned Law Officers further add that Federal Investigation Agency 
Act, 1974 only deals with investigation as well as inquiry regarding the offences 
mentioned in the schedule of said act and since any specific provision for trial of 
cases falling in schedule offences is not mentioned therein hence merely by way of 
inclusion of any offence in the schedule of the “Act” (supra), venue of the trial will 
not be effected.  
10.    
Arguments heard and available record perused.  
11.  
 
The Federal Investigation Agency was established by way of the 
Federal Investigation Agency Act, 1974 and as per definition contained in Section: 
2 (a) of the Act (ibid), “Agency” means the Federal Investigation Agency 
constituted under Section: 3, furthermore, as per Section: 3 (1) of the Act (ibid), the 
Federal Government may constitute an Agency to be called “the Federal 
Investigation Agency” for inquiry into, and investigation of the offences specified 
in the Schedule; for ready reference, both aforementioned sections are hereby 
reproduced as under: - 

                       Diary No.68328 dated: 13.05.2024 
               Writ Petition No.30611/2024  
  
   4 
 
“2. (a) “Agency” means the Federal Investigation Agency 
constituted under section 3;” 
 
 “3. 
Constitution of the Agency. (1) Notwithstanding anything 
contained in any other law for the time being in force, the Federal 
Government may constitute an Agency to be called the Federal 
Investigation Agency for inquiry into, and investigation of the 
offences specified in the Schedule, including an attempt or 
conspiracy to commit, and abetment of any such offence.” 
Preamble of the “Act” (ibid) is also hereby reproduced: - 
“Whereas it is expedient to provide for the constitution of Federal 
Investigation Agency for the investigation of certain offences 
committed in connection with matters concerning the Federal 
Government, and for matters connected therewith;” 
 
Perusal of Section: 3 of the Act (ibid) read with preamble clearly shows that 
Federal Investigation Agency has only been established for the purpose of 
investigation of and inquiring into the offences specified in the schedule. So, it is 
crystal clear that Federal Investigation Agency is only an “Investigating Agency” 
and the Federal Investigation Agency Act, 1974 only deals with investigation of 
and inquiring into the offences mentioned in the schedule and it is nowhere 
mentioned in said act that if any offence has been included in the schedule of said 
act, then any special Court will be established under said act for the purpose of 
taking cognizance and conducting trial of the case regarding said offence. Perusal 
of the schedule of the “Act” reveals that offences mentioned in various penal 
statues have been included in the same including from Pakistan Penal Code.  
 
 
So, when in the Federal Investigation Agency Act, 1974, it has not 
been mentioned that the offences included in the schedule will be tried by any 
Court established under said Act, then inspite of the inclusion of offence in the 
schedule of said Act, for the purpose of jurisdiction with respect to taking 
cognizance of the offence and trial of the case regarding said offence, the parent 
statute containing said offence will hold the field i.e. the Court established for 
taking cognizance and conducting trial of the case regarding said offence provided 
in its parent statute will take cognizance of the offence and conduct trial of the case 
e.g. offences mentioned in the Emigration Ordinance, 1979 are also included in the 
schedule of the Act (ibid) however same are tried by the Special Court established 
under Section: 24 of the Emigration Ordinance, 1979, some offences punishable 
under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 are included in the schedule of the “Act” (ibid) 
but same are tried by Anti-Terrorism Court and of course the offences mentioned in 
Pakistan Penal Code, which have been included in the schedule of the Act (ibid), 
will be tried by the Court established under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898.  
 
 
The offences relating to electricity contained in Chapter XVII-B of 
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 include Section: 462-J PPC also and offences under 

                       Diary No.68328 dated: 13.05.2024 
               Writ Petition No.30611/2024  
  
   5 
 
Sections: 462-H, 462-I, 462-J, 462-K, 462-I and 462-M have been included in the 
schedule of the Federal Investigation Agency Act, 1974 vide notification dated: 08th 
November, 2016; in this regard, relevant portion of said notification is hereby 
scanned below: -  
 
 
 
        
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since as per notification issued by the Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Interior 
dated: 15th January, 2009 (copy whereof has been placed on the record), District: 
Mandi Bahauddin falls in the territorial jurisdiction of Police Station: F.I.A., Sub-
Circle, Gujrat, therefore, instant case has been rightly registered at Police Station: 
F.I.A., Sub-Circle: Gujrat.  
 
 
Now question does arise that whether the place, where case has been 
registered, will decide the jurisdiction for the purpose of trial of the case or it would 
be the place of occurrence? Answer of this question is available in Section: 177 of 
Cr.P.C., which clearly shows that every offence shall ordinary be inquired in and 
tried by a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction it was committed; for 
ready reference, said section is hereby reproduced as follows: - 
“177.  Ordinary Place of inquiry and trial. Every offence shall 
ordinary be inquired in and tried by a Court within the local limits of 
whose jurisdiction it was committed.” 
 
Of course, in this case, place of occurrence is situated at Pahrianwali (
 ہ پا
ڑیانوالی), 
Tehsil: Phalia, District: Mandi Bahauddin, therefore, the Court having territorial 
jurisdiction regarding said place will be the competent Court to take cognizance as 
well as conduct trial of the case.  
 
 
Another question is also relevant here that apart from territorial 
jurisdiction, which Court is competent to take cognizance and conduct trial of the 
case with respect to offences relating to electricity contained in Chapter XVII-B of 
Pakistan Penal Code, in this regard, Section: 462-G (a) PPC clearly shows that the 
“Court” means the Court of Session designated as Electricity Utilities Court 

                       Diary No.68328 dated: 13.05.2024 
               Writ Petition No.30611/2024

empowered to take cognizance of an offence under this Chapter; for ready 
reference, same is hereby reproduced below: - 
 
 
“462-G  
(a) “Court” means the Court of Session designated as 
Electricity Utilities Court empowered to take cognizance 
of an offence under this Chapter.” 
 
Furthermore, it has been clearly mentioned in Column No.8 of Schedule-II of 
Cr.P.C. that said offences are triable by the Court of Session designated as Electricity 
Utilities Court and relevant portion from the same is reproduced as under: - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, the Court of Session designated as Electricity Utilities Court under 
Section: 462-G (a) PPC would be competent to take cognizance of the offences and 
conduct trial of the cases regarding said offences. It is also relevant to mention here 
that this Court vide notification bearing No.325/JOB(I)/VI.F.6 dated: 25.10.2019 
has already authorized all the District and Sessions Judges in the Punjab to hear and 
dispose of all such cases falling under Section: 462-G (a) of Criminal Law 
(Amendments) Act, 2016 with retrospective effect from 01.02.2016 and they have 
been further authorized to nominate one or two Additional District and Sessions 
Judges for said purpose till the establishment/constitution of regular new Electricity 
Utility Courts; relevant portion of said notification is hereby reproduced as under: - 
“The Hon'ble Chief Justice and Judges have been pleased to authorize 
all the District and Sessions Judges in the Punjab to hear and dispose 
of all such cases themselves and also authorize to nominate one or two 
Additional District and Sessions Judges, where required in view of the 
pendency of cases to hear and dispose of all such cases falling under 
Section 462G(a) of Criminal Law (Amendments) Act, 2016 with 
retrospective effect from 01.02.2016, till the establishment/constitution 
of regular new Electricity Utility Courts.” 
 
And in the light of said notification, District & Sessions Judge, Mandi 
Bahauddin has issued order vide Endst. No.1053/XV.B dated: 30.10.2019 
while nominating Additional District & Sessions Judge-I, Phalia for aforesaid

with the bifurcation as (1)-Model Criminal Trial Court, (II)-Model

Since place of occurrence in this case falls in the territorial jurisdiction of Sub-
Division: Phalia, therefore, learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Phalia being 
Electricity Utility Court is competent to take cognizance of said offence and conduct 
trial of the instant case regarding said offence under Section: 462-G (a) PPC.  
 
 
It is by now well settled that the Court competent to take cognizance 
of the offence and conduct trial of the case, is competent to entertain and decide the 
petition for bail as well in said case; therefore, in this case, learned Additional 
Sessions Judge-I, Phalia/Electricity Utility Court (as mentioned above) is 
competent to entertain petition for bail and decide the same in accordance with law.  
  
It is relevant to mention here that when there will be any doubt 
regarding jurisdiction to inquire into or try any offence, then “High Court” under 
Section: 185 (1) Cr.P.C. will decide that which Court will inquire into or try the 
offence; for ready reference, Section: 185 (1) Cr.P.C. is reproduced below: - 
“185.  High Court to decide, in case of doubt, district where 
inquiry or trial shall take place. (1) Whenever a question arises as 
to which of two or more Courts subordinate to the same High Court 
ought to inquire into or try any offence, it shall be decided by that 
High Court.” 
 
Therefore, while exercising powers vested under Section: 185 (1) of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898, this Court decides that the Court (if otherwise competent 
to take cognizance) in whose territorial jurisdiction, occurrence has been committed 
i.e. the place of occurrence is situated, will take cognizance of the offence and 
conduct trial of the case and in this case, said Court would be the Court of learned 
Additional Sessions Judge-I/Electricity Utility Court, Phalia.  
12.  
 
In view of what has been discussed above, instant petition stands 
disposed of with the clear observation that learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Phalia 
being Electricity Utility Court will take cognizance of the offence, conduct trial of this 
case as well as entertain and decide application for bail in the case accordingly. 
Registrar of this Court will send copy of this order to all the learned Sessions Judges in 
the Punjab as well as to Head of Federal Investigation Agency in the Punjab.
