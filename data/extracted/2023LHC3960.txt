RAHEEL KAMRAN, J. – In this reference application under 
Section 47 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 („Act‟),  the following questions of 
law were proposed for our opinion which are asserted to have arisen from 
the order dated 14.12.2016 passed by the Appellate Tribunal Inland 
Revenue, Lahore („Tribunal‟) in Miscellaneous Application No. 373/LB of 
2016 in STA No.1051/LB of 2015:- 
i. 
"Whether on the facts and circumstances of the 
case, in the garb of rectification the learned 
Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue has illegally 
assumed the power of review? 
 
ii. 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the 
case, the learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue 
had the power to amend its order in the name of 
rectification by deleting the demand which was 
upheld by the Collector (Appeals)?”  
  
2. 
Factual background of the case is that show cause notice dated 
29.01.2015 was issued to the respondent wherein it was charged with 
contravention of Sections 3, 6, 7, 8B, 22 and 26 of the Act read with S.R.O. 
No.647(I)/2007, dated 27.06.2007 as amended. The respondent joined the 
adjudicating proceedings and the Deputy Commissioner passed the 
assessment order dated 02.04.2015 creating a demand to pay the sales tax 
amounting to Rs.12,970,064/-  alongwith the default surcharge (to be 

Sales Tax Reference No.53 of 2017 
2 
calculated at the time of deposit) under Section 34 of the Act alongwith 
penalty of Rs.6,48,503/- under Section 33(5) of the Act. The respondent 
preferred an appeal against the aforementioned assessment order, which 
was dismissed by the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals), vide order 
in appeal dated 09.06.2015. The respondent, being aggrieved, preferred 
further appeal before the Tribunal, being STA No.1051/LB/2015, which 
was dismissed vide order dated 02.06.2016, however, on 30.08.2016 the 
respondent filed an application for rectification of order dated 02.06.2016 
and the Tribunal reversed its order and accepted appeal of the respondent 
vide order dated 14.12.2016 impugned herein. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that in the facts and 
circumstances of the case, the Tribunal unlawfully assumed jurisdiction of 
review in the garb of rectification under Section 57 of the Act and reversed 
the order dated 02.06.2016 while accepting appeal of the respondent vide 
impugned order dated 14.12.2016. He maintains that there is a marked 
distinction between rectification and review inasmuch as the former is 
confined to correction of any clerical or arithmetical error in the order of 
assessment or adjudication which is apparent from the face of record 
whereas review entails reconsideration of the matter on discovery of new 
facts or patent error of law occurring in the order or judgment sought to be 
reviewed.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has supported the 
impugned order for the reasons stated therein. 
5. 
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the 
available record.     
6. 
The subject matter of rectification recently came under consideration 
of this Court in the case of Commissioner Inland Revenue vs. Messrs 
Lahore Rubber Store (2023 PTD 182) wherein it was observed:- 
“7….Mostly, the application for rectification is moved, 
after lapse of limitation to file Tax Reference. It is held that 
rectification jurisdiction cannot be a substitute of Tax 
Reference, therefore, the Tribunal must check the bona fide 
by seeking explanation for not filing rectification 

Sales Tax Reference No.53 of 2017 
3 
application soon after the date of receiving certified copy 
of the final order.  
 The law intends rectification, of an identified mistake, 
within the existing final order and not another independent 
order for different reasons. The Appellate Tribunal must 
identify the mistake, of law or fact, in accordance with the 
stipulated guidelines given by the august Supreme Court in 
National Food Laboratories Case, supra. After recording 
reasons for the identified mistake, the mistake should be 
corrected in the original final order, sought to be rectified. 
On such correction or amendment, if result of the appeal 
demands change, reasons for changing the result should be 
recorded separately. 
After exercising original jurisdiction, the Tribunal becomes 
functus-officio with a little window for rectification of a 
mistake which in our opinion is an equitable remedy 
because law favour justice, to ensure that, an apparent and 
floating mistake, causing injustice, is allowed to be 
rectified within limitation of five years. Normally, an 
appealable order attains finality on expiration of limitation 
for filing the appeal or other remedy. Such a finality, 
cannot be compromised by filing an application for 
rectification to manage rehearing or review of the matter. 
Any injustice, because of an identified mistake, is 
rectifiable, as envisages in Section 221 of Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 (“Ordinance of 2001”), Section 57 of 
Sales Tax Act, 1990 (“Act of 1990) and Section 70 of 
Federal Excise Act, 2005 (“Act of 2005”).” 
7. 
To further explore the nature and scope of jurisdiction qua 
rectification under Section 57 of the Act in the light of submissions made 
by learned counsel for the applicant, it would be advantageous to refer to 
the text of provisions thereof, which are reproduced hereunder:- 
 
“Rectification of mistake.---(1) The officer of Inland 
Revenue, Commissioner, the Commissioner (Appeals) or 
the Appellate Tribunal may, by an order in writing, amend 
any order passed by him to rectify any mistake apparent 
from the record on his or its own motion or any mistake 
brought to his or its notice by a taxpayer or, in the case of 
the Commissioner (Appeals) or the Appellate Tribunal, the 
Commissioner. 
 
(2) No order under sub-section (1) which has the effect of 
increasing an assessment, reducing a refund or otherwise 
applying adversely to the taxpayer shall be made unless the 
taxpayer has been given a reasonable opportunity of being 
heard. 
(3) Where a mistake apparent on the record is brought to 
the notice of the officer of Inland Revenue, Commissioner 

Sales Tax Reference No.53 of 2017 
4 
or Commissioner (Appeals), as the case may be, and no 
order been made under sub-section (1), before the 
expiration of the financial year next following the date on 
which the mistake was brought to their notice, the mistake 
shall be treated as rectified and all the provisions of this 
Act shall have effect accordingly. 
 
(4) No order under sub-section (1) shall be made after five 
years from the date of the order sought to be rectified.” 
 
8. 
Prior to its substitution by the Finance Act, 2013 (XXII of 2013), 
Section 57 of the Act reads as under:- 
“Correction 
of 
clerical 
errors, 
etc.—Clerical 
or 
arithmetical errors in any assessment, adjudication, order 
or decision may, at any time, be corrected by the officer of 
Inland Revenue who made the assessment or adjudication 
or passed such order or decision or by this successor in 
office. 
Provided that before such correction, a notice shall be 
given to the registered person or to a person affected by 
such correction.”     
9. 
 A comparison of the text of provisions of Section 57 of the Act 
makes it abundantly clear that the scope of rectification, which was 
previously confined to correction of clerical or arithmetical errors in any 
assessment, adjudication, order or decision, has been enlarged to rectify 
any mistake in the order which is apparent from the record. Rectification of 
mistake in the order may be made by the officer of Inland Revenue, 
Commissioner, the Commissioner (Appeals) or the Tribunal on his or its own 
motion or when the same is brought to his or its notice by a taxpayer or, in the 
case of the Commissioner (Appeals) or the Appellate Tribunal, by the 
Commissioner. However, the essential condition for the exercise of such 
power is that the mistake should be apparent from the record i.e. the 
mistake which may be seen floating on the surface and does not require 
investigation or further evidence. Any mistake in the order which is not 
patent and obvious from the record cannot be termed to be rectifiable. 
Indeed, the power of rectification visualized under Section 57 ibid may not 
cover a full-fledged review of an order on discovery of new evidence or 
fresh legal ground becoming available after the decision sought to be 
corrected. However, the failure to adjudicate upon a substantial plea taken 
or controversy raised, when materially affects outcome of the case, in our 

Sales Tax Reference No.53 of 2017 
5 
opinion, does constitute a mistake apparent from the record which is 
rectifiable under Section 57 of the Act subject to satisfaction of other 
conditions and limitations specified therein. Needless to observe that a 
mistake is not rectifiable when the decision sought to be rectified was 
already assailed in appeal or Tax Reference which merged into the final 
decision of that higher forum.       
10. 
Adverting now to the facts and circumstances of the instant case, 
operative part of the order dated 02.06.2016 is to the following effect:- 
“6…We have noted that according to section 8B(1) 
adjustment of input tax; a registered person shall not be 
allowed to adjust input tax in excess of ninety percent of 
the output tax for that tax period while there seems to be a 
willful default from the appellant's side and because of it 
the default surcharge and penalty u/s 34 and 33(5) was 
charged by the assessing officer. It is pertinent to mention 
here that the appellant-registered person had himself 
declared his status as "Distributor” in his monthly sales 
tax return and owing to this fact obviously has adjusted 
10% excess output tax which otherwise he was likely to 
pay. Further observed that the appellant did not comply 
with the express provisions of section 8B of the Sales Tax 
Act. 1990 and in view of this position he could not satisfy 
the authorities below with his altogether material evidence. 
Also observed that the case law furnished by the learned 
counsel for the appellant during the court proceedings are 
not on all fours to the facts of the appellant's case and as 
such vividly ignoring the legality of the appellant's case.” 
 
11. 
It is evident from perusal of Paragraph No.4 of the order dated 
02.06.2016 passed by the Tribunal that the respondent raised a categorical 
plea that 10% unadjusted input tax was available for adjustment in the very 
next tax period which, being a substantive right of the taxpayer, could not 
be denied. This being a substantial plea materially affecting outcome of the 
case i.e. determination of tax liability of the respondent, was required to be 
adjudicated upon and failure to do so by the Tribunal constituted a mistake 
obvious and apparent from the record that was rectifiable, which prompted 
the respondent to file an application on 30.08.2016 for rectification of the 
order dated 02.06.2016 under section 57 of the Act. It is manifest from 
perusal of the impugned order dated 14.12.2016 that the rectification 
application of the respondent has been allowed while recording valid 
reasons, the operative part whereof is reproduced herein below:- 
 

Sales Tax Reference No.53 of 2017 
6 
 
“7. We have perused the case law as well as the copies of 
the sales tax returns furnished by the appellant. It is clear 
from the perusal of the returns that even if 10% tax would 
have been paid, it would have become adjustable in the 
very next tax period and if, at all the input tax remained 
unadjusted, it was refundable at the end of the financial 
year in terms of section 8B of the Sales Tax Act, 1990. Rule 
34 of the Sales Tax Rules, 2006 also allows refund of 
excess input tax paid as a consequence of application of 
provisions of section 8B of the Act. 
8. Considering these facts, it is apparent that the case law 
referred by the appellant is on all fours applicable to the 
case at hand. Apparently, a mistake of fact was made by 
the Appellate Tribunal while rendering the judgment. It is, 
therefore, held that it is a case of apparent error and 
mistake which is floating on the surface. This makes the 
order rectifiable in nature. 
9. Consequently, it is held that principal amount of tax 
cannot be recovered from the taxpayer as it will be a case 
of double taxation, not warranted under the law. The 
demand on this account is, therefore, annulled. Resultantly, 
the appeal filed by the taxpayer is accepted and the 
impugned order passed by the Commissioner Inland 
Revenue (Appeals-III) is hereby cancelled to the extent of 
principal amount of tax. However, in the light of the ratio 
already decided by the Tribunal in STA No.1108/LB/2014, 
it is held that the appellant is liable to pay default 
surcharge for the relevant tax period. The penalty is also 
reduced to Rs.10,000/- (Rupees ten thousand only) in terms 
of section 33(5) of the Act, being inevitable as the taxpayer 
has defaulted the provisions of section 8B of the Act.” 
12. 
In the case of Commissioner Inland Revenue, Multan Vs. Messrs 
Hafeez Ghee and General Mills (Pvt.) Ltd Multan (2020 PTD 2025) a 
Division Bench of this Court held as under:- 
“4.The Appellate Tribunal had reached the conclusion that 
by adjustment of 100% input tax against output, no loss 
has been caused to the revenue because the said amount 
could subsequently be adjusted by the respondent and the 
taxpayer cannot be deprived of its legitimate right to do so. 
Furthermore, explanation has been given by the 
respondent that in Form there are no separate columns for 
90% adjustment and 100% adjustment. As major portion of 
input tax was 100% adjustable therefore, they had sought 
100% adjustment of the sales tax. We do not find any 
illegality in the view taken by the Appellate Tribunal that 
the respondent was entitled for 100% adjustment. Although 
procedure prescribed in law has not been followed, at the 

Sales Tax Reference No.53 of 2017 
7 
most the department can claim penalty for the said 
lapse...”  
 
13. 
Learned counsel for the applicant could not point out any illegality 
or infirmity in the impugned order. Accordingly, the question No.(i) is 
answered in negative while question No.(ii) is answered in affirmative i.e. 
both in favour of the respondent and against the revenue authorities. This 
Reference Application is disposed of accordingly.  
14. 
The office shall send a copy of this judgment under seal of the Court 
to the Appellate Tribunal in compliance with Section 47(5) of the Act.
