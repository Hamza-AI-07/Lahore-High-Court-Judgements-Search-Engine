Through this constitutional petition, the 
petitioner has challenged the orders dated 19.12.2022 and 
22.12.2022 (impugned orders) passed by respondent No.1 
(Governor Punjab), whereby while exercising powers 
under Article 130(7) of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (Constitution), Session of 
Provincial Assembly was summoned and petitioner was 
required to take vote of confidence, however, the former 
order was not effectuated in view of the Ruling Order 

3 
W.P.No.82603 of 2022 
 
 
 
passed by respondent No.3 (Speaker) on 20.12.2022. 
Eventually, vide impugned order dated 22.12.2022, while 
exercising the powers under Article 130(7) of the 
Constitution read with Rule 22(7) of the Rules of Procedure 
of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 1997 (Rules), it 
was held that petitioner has ceased to hold the office of the 
Chief Minister and the Cabinet was also dissolved, 
however, the petitioner was allowed to continue to perform 
functions under Article 133 of the Constitution, till the next 
Chief Minister takes the charge of the office. This Court in 
this petition, vide order dated 23.12.2022, recorded the 
contentions of the petitioner and issued notices to the 
respondents. As an interim relief, the impugned orders 
were also held in abeyance. The relevant Para of the said 
order is reproduced hereunder: 
“In view of above submissions and undertaking 
given by the petitioner, the operation of impugned 
orders dated 19.12.2022 and 22.12.2022 shall be 
held in abeyance till the next date of hearing, 
however, this order will not preclude the petitioner 
from taking vote of confidence on his own accord.” 
2. 
The writ petition was being argued by learned 
counsel for the petitioner, when during the pendency of this 
Writ Petition, on 12.01.2023, the petitioner obtained vote 
of confidence in terms of the Article 130(7) of the 

4 
W.P.No.82603 of 2022 
 
 
 
constitution from the Provincial Assembly in its sitting held 
on 12.01.2023. In pursuance thereto, the Notification has 
been issued by the Speaker on 12.01.2023 and same has 
also been communicated to the Governor Punjab on the 
same date.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the respondent No.1 (Mr. 
Mansoor Usman Awan, Advocate) in view of above 
developments made following statement in Court:- 
“The Governor has received the report from the 
Speaker dated 12.01.2023 confirming that Chief 
Minister has obtained vote of confidence in terms of 
Clause (7) of the Article 130 of the Constitution while 
complying with the order dated 19.12.2022 of the 
Governor. As consequence of compliance, the Governor 
has withdrawn the order dated 22.12.2022.” 
4. 
In view of the statement made by the learned 
counsel for the respondent No.1, it is evident that 
impugned order dated 19.12.2022 stood complied with by 
the petitioner and the Governor Punjab affirmed his 
pleasure, who is not proceeding against the petitioner 
under Article 130(7) of the Constitution and whereas the 
other impugned order dated 22.12.2022, being the 
consequence of allegedly not taking vote of confidence in 
terms of order dated 19.12.2022, is also withdrawn in view 
of above statement, when petitioner had taken vote of 

5 
W.P.No.82603 of 2022 
 
 
 
confidence on 12.01.2023 successfully, passing the floor 
test, which is required under Article 130(7) of the 
Constitution.  
5. 
In view of above, we do not need to adjudicate upon 
the justiciability of the reasons/grounds stated in order 
dated 19.12.2022 of the Governor Punjab for reaching 
satisfaction in terms of Article 130(7) of the Constitution 
and merits of the order of the Speaker of the Assembly in 
the context of the ratio settled in the case of “Pir Sabir 
Shah Versus Federation of Pakistan and others” (PLD 
1994 SC 738), which questions are left open for 
determination in any other case. Furthermore, in the light 
of the statement of the Governor Punjab, this petition has 
borne 
fruit, 
consequently 
the 
Notification 
dated 
22.12.2022 issued by the Chief Secretary Punjab is set-
aside. This petition is disposed of accordingly.
