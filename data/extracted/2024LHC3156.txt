SADAQAT ALI KHAN, J. Sher Afzal 
(petitioner) being convict seeks an order to run 
concurrently his sentences of imprisonment awarded 
to him in two different following trials/cases.  
2. 
The petitioner was convicted and awarded death 
sentence in case FIR No.72 Dated 26.06.2005 u/s 
302 P.S. Jand, Attock  by the trial Court vide 
judgment dated 23.12.2009, on the same date i.e. 
23.12.2009, he was also convicted and sentenced to 
death in case FIR No.145 Dated 30.09.2006 u/ss 302 
& 34 PPC P.S. Jand, Attock.  
3. 
Death sentence of the petitioner in case FIR 
No.72 of 2005 mentioned above has not been 
confirmed and converted into imprisonment for life by 
the Division Bench of this Court vide judgment dated 
10.02.2016 (Crl.A.No.539 of 2009) but death sentence of 
the petitioner in case FIR No.145 of 2006 stated 
above has been confirmed by the Division Bench of 
this 
Court 
vide 
judgment 
dated 
10.02.2016 
(Crl.A.No.540 & M.R.No.88 of 2009) which was challenged 
before the Supreme Court of Pakistan and has been 
converted into imprisonment for life vide judgment 
dated 03.01.2022 (Crl.A.No.450 of 2019) but record shows 

2 
Crl.Misc.No.729 of 2024 
 
 
 
that it was not brought into the notice of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan that other Crl.A.No.451 of 
2019 filed by the petitioner against his conviction and 
sentence of life imprisonment was also pending and 
benefit of section 397 Cr.P.C has also not been 
requested. Thereafter, Crl.A.No.451 of 2019 was 
disposed of being not pressed by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan vide judgment dated 06.11.2023 in order 
to avail remedy before the High Court by filing of writ 
petition in view of provisions of Section.397 Cr.P.C. 
seeking order to run concurrently both the sentences 
of imprisonment of the petitioner discussed above.  
4. 
Relevant section 397 Cr.P.C. in this respect is 
hereby reproduced:- 
[397. Sentence on offender already sentenced 
for another offence. When a person, already 
undergoing 
a 
sentence 
of 
imprisonment 
or 
imprisonment 
for 
life, 
is 
sentenced 
to 
imprisonment, or imprisonment for life, such 
imprisonment, or imprisonment for life shall 
commence at the expiration of the imprisonment, 
or imprisonment for life to which he has been 
previously sentenced, unless the Court directs that 
the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently 
with such previous sentence: 
 
Provided that where a person who has been 
sentenced to imprisonment by an order under 
section 123 in default of furnishing security is, 
whilst undergoing such sentence, sentenced to 
imprisonment for an offence committed prior to the 
making of such order, the latter sentence shall 
commence immediately.] 
5. 
The said provision of law expressly enables the 
Court to direct that subsequent sentence of the 
convict would run concurrently with the previous 
sentence. It has been clarified in section 397 Cr.P.C 
that the Court while analyzing the facts and 
circumstances of every case is competent to direct 
that the sentences of a convict in two different trials 
would run concurrently. The provisions of section 
397 Cr.P.C. confer wide discretion on the Court to 
extend such benefit to the convict in a case of 
peculiar nature. In a situation like the present one, 

3 
Crl.Misc.No.729 of 2024 
 
 
 
the Court of law cannot fold up its hands to deny the 
benefit of the said beneficial provision to convict 
because such denial would amount to ruthless 
treatment to him and would certainly jeopardize his 
life undergoing such a long imprisonment and benefit 
conferred upon the petitioner by the Court from 
death to imprisonment for life certainly evaporates if 
discretion 
of 
directing 
the 
sentences 
to 
run 
concurrently is denied to him rather would bring at 
naught and ultimately the object of the same would 
squarely be defeated and that too, under the 
circumstances when the provisions of S.397 Cr.P.C. 
bestows wide discretion on the Court and unfettered 
one to extend such benefit to the convict in a case of 
a peculiar nature like the present one. Thus, 
construing the beneficial provisions in favour of the 
convict would clearly meets the ends of justice and 
interpreting the same to the contrary would certainly 
defeat the same. The legislation under the provision 
of section 397 Cr.P.C. is quite compassionate having 
tender feelings and has empowered the courts to 
order the subsequent sentence to run concurrently to 
the previous sentence of a convict. This is the entire 
discretion and appanage of the Court to exercise its 
powers 
moderately 
and 
judiciously. 
When 
the 
universal principle of law is to be given effect in case 
of punishment, it is for the Courts to struggle and 
favour in order to interpret the law where liberty of 
convict is to be given preference instead of curtail it 
without animated reasons and justness. 
6. 
Once the legislation has conferred the above 
discretion upon the Court then in hardship cases, 
Courts are required to take into consideration the 

4 
Crl.Misc.No.729 of 2024 
 
 
 
same with immense seriousness to the benefit of a 
convict to minimize and liquidate the hardship 
treatment. 
7. 
Extending the benefit of beneficial provision in 
favour of the petitioner would clearly meet the ends of 
justice, 
therefore, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
facts 
and 
circumstances of this case, this Court observes that 
there is no wrong and harm in treating both the 
sentences of imprisonment for life of the petitioner to 
run concurrently. 
8. 
In cases where sentences of convict in different 
trial have not been ordered to run concurrently 
rather trials, appellate and revisional courts are silent 
on this point, then in appropriate cases as in present 
case inherit jurisdiction of this Court in terms of 
section 561-A Cr.P.C. read with section 397 Cr.P.C. 
can be invoked, provided, of course, where the 
superior Court of Appeal specifically and consciously 
has not denied the benefit of provisions of section 
397 Cr.P.C. (2018 SCMR 418 “RAHIB ALI V. The 
STATE”).  
9. 
In view of above, this petition is allowed, it is 
directed that sentences of the petitioner in case FIR 
No.72 dated 26.06.2005 u/s 302 PPC P.S. Jand, 
Attock and FIR No.145 dated 30.09.2006 u/ss 302 & 
34 PPC P.S. Jand, Attock shall run concurrently with 
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C.
