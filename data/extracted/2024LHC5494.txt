Shahid Karim, J:-. This judgment will decide an 
Application under Section 6 of the Recognition and 
Enforcement (Arbitral Agreement & Foreign Arbitral 
Award) Act, 2011 (“the 2011 Act”).  It has been brought by 
SpaceCom International LLC (SpaceCom) a private 
company incorporated under the laws of Virginia in the 
United States of America and seeks enforcement of the 
award against the respondent-Wateen Telecom Limited 
(Wateen). 
Facts and Background: 
2. 
SpaceCom is a global information and communications 
technology systems integrator or global satellite service 
provider. It engages in the design, provisioning, integration, 
and operation of satellite communication networks. The 
networks are used, inter alia, for mobile backhaul, 
telephony, and data services for remote locations and 
enterprise communication networks. As part of its service 
offering, SpaceCom leases satellite transponder capacity and 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
2
provides network engineering and monitoring services.  
Wateen is a Pakistani public limited company and is 
involved in the provision of communications services, 
including voice, internet and multimedia, through satellite 
and fixed line networks to corporate customers and to the 
general public in Pakistan.  
3. 
On 15 August 2014 SpaceCom entered into a Master 
Service Agreement with Wateen (SpaceCom Service 
Agreement No.: 30-07014) (the “2014 MSA”). The 2014 
MSA related to the provision of leased transponder 
capacities on the ABS-7 (Asia Broadcast Satellite) and IS-
904 (Intelsat) Satellites, and network management and 
monitoring services (the “Satellite Services”) to Wateen. 
SpaceCom provided Satellite Services to Wateen, which 
used the Satellite Services to provide mobile backhaul (i.e. 
connectivity from remote mobile phone antenna towers, 
which have no fibre optic or copper wire connection, to its 
mobile switches and the rest of its network). 
4. 
The 2014 MSA acted as an overarching contract 
between the parties, pursuant to which the parties entered 
into various service orders. Two service orders were issued 
and signed by SpaceCom and Wateen under the 2014 MSA, 
i.e. Service ID No.2001 (“SO 2001”) and Service ID 
No.2002 (“SO 2002”) (together the “Service Orders”). The 
Service Orders stated that they were issued on 31 July 2014. 
They were signed by SpaceCom on 15 August 2014, the 
same day as the 2014 MSA. Pursuant to the Service Orders, 
SpaceCom was to provide transponder capacity on the IS-
904 satellite for a period of 26 months and on the ABS-7 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
3
satellite for a period of 24 months commencing 01 May 
2014. 
5. 
By way of background, it may be mentioned that the 
2014 MSA was not the first agreement between the parties. 
The parties had previously entered into Master Service 
Agreement in 2007 effective from 25 September 2007 (the 
“2007 MSA”) as well as revised Master Service Agreement 
No.67007-B in 2013 (the “2013 MSA”) along with related 
service orders (Service ID Nos. 1007A and 1012B). 
Disputes under the 2013 MSA were resolved through a 
settlement agreement between the parties executed on or 
around 30 April 2014 (the “Settlement Agreement”) which 
involved the payment of certain sums by Wateen to the 
Applicant as well as the parties entering into the 2014 MSA. 
The parties entered into the 2014 MSA, however, it is 
alleged by SpaceCom that Wateen failed to pay the full 
settlement sums on time in breach of its terms.  
6. 
It may be noted that the detailed facts and history of 
events between the parties including their dispute formed the 
subject matter of the Award on the Merits along with 
Appendix I (Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Procedural 
Objection) mentioned below and are narrated in detail 
therein.  
7. 
For the purposes of the instant Application, the relevant 
fact is that the parties agreed upon, executed, and entered 
into the 2014 MSA, which finally and uptill its termination 
governed the relationship between the parties superseding 
any previous MSA. SpaceCom submits that the parties not 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
4
only accepted the obligations contained in the 2014 MSA 
but also acted upon the agreement. 
8. 
SpaceCom states that differences arose between the 
parties during the subsistence of the 2014 MSA arising out 
of the fact that while Wateen profited from the Satellite 
Services provided by SpaceCom, it repeatedly failed to pay 
for them remaining consistently in default of its various 
contractual obligations to pay sums due to SpaceCom. 
9. 
SpaceCom initiated arbitration with DIFC-LCIA (First 
RFA).  DIFC-LCIA sought clarification on the applicability 
of the rules from both the parties by reference to the 
arbitration agreement which provided for arbitration “In 
Dubai, UAE pursuant to rules of arbitration of the Dubai 
International Financial Center (DIFC)” rather than 
expressly referring to the rules of DIFC-LCIA.  It is 
pertinent to mention that DIFC has a separate court and a 
legal system which governs matters of arbitration and is the 
appointing authority in DIFC arbitration law.  DIFC-LCIA, 
on the other hand, is an arbitral institution and differs from 
DIFC on that account.  (These terms will be expanded in the 
later part. 
10. In response to the Email by DIFC-LCIA, SpaceCom 
responded in the following terms: 
“Regarding your inquiry below, the Claimant responds that 
the language at issue was drafted by the Respondent. It was 
and remains Claimant’s understanding that when the 
parties referred to “the Rules of Arbitration of the Dubai 
International Financial Centre”, they in fact meant the 
Rules of the DIFC-LCIA. That said, the Claimant is not 
aware of any evidence relevant to this question.  
 
If the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s 
understanding, the Claimant is willing to agree to proceed 
under the second scenario (arbitration under the DIFC 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
5
Arbitration Law, with the DIFC court as appointing 
authority for the third arbitrator).” 
 
11. A reading of the response, set out above, would show 
that SpaceCom itself was not clear regarding precise sweep 
of the arbitration clause relating to rules of arbitration and 
whether the rules of DIFC court or DIFC-LCIA would 
apply.  Rather it was willing to engage with Wateen to agree 
to proceed for arbitration under either of the laws.  During 
this period Wateen did not formally take a position.  
Correspondence was exchanged on the issue between the 
parties but it is the case of SpaceCom that Wateen failed to 
take any position and in the meantime SpaceCom emailed 
Wateen for appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal to which 
there was no response.  This was done on 02.02.2016 and 
04.03.2016.  SpaceCom thereafter issued a second RFA due 
to Wateen’s refusal to clarify.  On 25.07.2016 Wateen 
claimed arbitration in Dubai UAE while refusing ad hoc 
arbitration. The contents of Wateen’s refusal dated 
25.07.2016 are set out below: 
“We are in receipt of your document entitled “Request for 
Arbitration”, in respect of which, we have the following 
observations and reservations.  
 
Pursuant to Clause 14 of the MSA, any arbitration 
between the Parties is to be conducted in Dubai UAE, 
whereas you have erroneously and arbitrarily determined 
DIFC as the venue. We understand that the Dubai 
International Financial Centre is a special economic free 
zone forming an “offshore” jurisdiction separate from 
mainland” Dubai. The reality is that the contract was not 
executed in the Dubai International Financial Centre, 
neither party is based in the Dubai International 
Financial Centre, the contract was not performed in the 
Dubai International Financial Centre, there is no 
connection whatsoever with the Dubai International 
Finance Centre, and we do not consent to it and any such 
attempt is clearly in contravention of the arbitration 
process envisaged in the MSA.  
 
Additionally you have asserted that the arbitration shall be 
subject to the “DIFC Arbitration Law”. We see nothing in 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
6
the arbitration clause to that effect and since your 
understanding of the seat/venue is also misconceived, we 
do not provide our consent to it.” 
 
12. The above position clarifies the stance of Wateen that 
the seat of arbitration is to be Dubai UAE which is mainland 
Dubai as distinguished from an offshore jurisdiction vesting 
in DIFC.  Thus, for the first time on 25.07.2016 Wateen 
comes forth on its stated position with regard to the seat of 
arbitration and denies jurisdiction to vest in DIFC-LCIA.  In 
the meantime SpaceCom filed arbitration claim form in 
DIFC court of first instance for declaration of DIFC seat and 
appointment of Arbitral Tribunal.  To counter this, Wateen 
filed a suit in August 2016 in Lahore and obtained 
injunction in the Lahore suit.  SpaceCom also sought an 
anti-suit injunction in DIFC court which was granted on 
25.02.2017.  The final anti-suit injunction was granted by 
DIFC court on 09.03.2017.  While doing so, the court also 
confirmed DIFC as the seat of arbitration.  On 14.03.2017 
Wateen withdrew proceedings in the Lahore suit and made 
an application to the DIFC court on 09.04.2017 whereupon 
DIFC court issued a clarificatory ruling on 23.5.2017 
reiterating its earlier ruling regarding seat of arbitration and 
the rules applicable thereto.  On 09.08.2017 SpaceCom filed 
an amended request for arbitration and proceedings 
commenced through third RFA. 
Arbitrators: 
13. As adumbrated, clause 14 contains the dispute 
resolution clause and provides that: 
“14. Dispute resolution. This agreement and any disputes 
arising hereunder shall be governed by the law of the 
Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to the conflicts 
of laws provisions thereof. In the event of any dispute 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
7
leading to arbitration or litigation hereunder, the prevailing 
Party shall be entitled to an award of attorney’s fees and 
costs. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this 
Agreement, or the breach, termination, or validity hereof, 
shall be resolved through arbitration in Dubai U.A.E 
pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration of the Dubai 
International Financial Centre (DIFC) by a panel 
consisting of three arbitrators. One arbitrator shall be 
appointed by each party, and the parties shall agree on the 
third, who shall be the chairman of the arbitration panel, 
provided that if the parties cannot agree on the third 
arbitrator, then the two selected arbitrators shall jointly 
appoint the third (failing which the third arbitrator shall be 
selected by DIFC). The decision of the arbitration panel 
shall be binding and judgment on the decision may be 
entered in any court empowered to enforce it.” 
 
14. It is clarified that the parties nominated their arbitrators 
and the third arbitrator was nominated by the two arbitrators 
appointed by the parties.  Thus, neither DIFC court nor 
DIFC-LCIA nominated the arbitrators.  The arbitration 
proceedings were registered as DIFC-LCIA arbitration 
No.DL 17109 and commenced on 9 August 2017.  The seat 
of arbitration proceedings was the Dubai International 
Financial Centre (DIFC) which is a financial free zone 
within Dubai UAE.  UAE is a contracting state to the 1958 
United Nations Convention on the Recognition and 
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (The New York 
Convention).  The following awards were rendered by the 
Arbitral Tribunal: 
(i) 
“Award on the Merits dated 15 April 2020 in DIFC-LCIA 
Arbitration No.DL 17109 between SpaceCom International, LLC 
(“SpaceCom”) and Wateen Telecom Limited (“Wateen”) 
including Appendix 1 i.e. Partial Award on Jurisdiction and 
Procedural Objection dated 22 November 2018 between the same 
parties and Appendix II Interest Calculation; and  
(ii) 
Award on Costs dated 08 November 2020 in the same arbitration 
between the same parties. 
(The Awards above are hereinafter collectively referred to as the 
“Awards”)” 
15. The Application is accompanied by certified copy of 
Award on merits dated 15 April 2020 along with appendix I 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
8
and II and certified copy of the Award on costs dated 8 
November 2020. 
16. Prior to this on 29 March 2018, the Arbitral Tribunal 
notified the parties that it had decided that the arbitration 
proceedings would be bifurcated so as to deal with the 
respondents’ jurisdictional and procedural objections first.  
Following a hearing on jurisdictional and procedural 
objections on 27 September 2018, the Tribunal issued its 
Partial Award on jurisdictional and procedural objection 
dated 22 November 2018 (the Partial Award). The Arbitral 
Tribunal held that: 
“267. The Tribunal awards, declares and orders as follows:  
(1) 
The DIFC Court’s ruling and order in Claim 
No.ARB-010-2016 dated 09 March 2017 and 23 May 2017 
are res judicata as between the Claimant and the 
Respondent and have preclusive effect in this arbitration; 
(2) Accordingly, the seat of this arbitration in the Dubai 
International Financial Centre and the arbitration rules 
applicable in this arbitration are the Arbitration Rules of 
the DIFC-LCIA Arbitration Centre; 
(3) The Claimant has not waived the right to pursue, and is 
not estopped from pursuing, arbitration against the 
Respondent pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the DIFC-
LCIA Arbitration Centre under the Master Service 
Agreement executed between the parties on 15 August 2014 
(Spacecom Service Agreement No.30-07014); 
(4) The Tribunal declines to stay these arbitration 
proceedings;  
(5) The Respondent’s challenge to the jurisdiction of this 
Tribunal relating to the applicable arbitration rules and the 
Respondent’s procedural objection relating to the seat of 
the arbitration are dismissed; and  
(6) The issues of the parties’ legal and other costs incurred 
is deferred to the merits stage of this arbitration.” 
 
17. According to the Arbitral Tribunal, DIFC court’s ruling 
and orders in claim ARB-010-2016 dated 9 March 2017 and 
23 May 2017 are res judicata as between the claimant and 
Wateen and have preclusive effect in the arbitration 
proceedings.  Accordingly, it was held that the seat of 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
9
arbitration was DIFC and the applicable rules would be the 
arbitration rules of DIFC-LCIA arbitral centre. 
Wateen’s Defence and its rebuttal: 
18.  Wateen’s defence under the 2011 Act is premised on 
Articles V (1)(d) and V(2)(b) of the Schedule to the 2011 
Act which provides that: 
“1. Recognition and enforcement of the award may be 
refused, at the request of the party against whom it is 
invoked, only if that party furnishes to the competent 
authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought. 
Proof that:- 
 
(d) The composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral 
procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the 
parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance 
with the law of the country where the arbitration took 
place;” 
 
“V(2)(b) The recognition and enforcement of the award 
would be contrary to the public policy of that country. 
 
19. Article V (2)(b) provides the grounds on which 
recognition and enforcement of award may be refused at the 
request of the party against whom it is invoked.  Two of the 
grounds invoked by Wateen are contained in the clauses set 
out above.  Wateen alleges that the composition of arbitral 
authority for the arbitral proceedings was not in accordance 
with the agreement of the parties.  Learned counsel for 
Wateen has elaborated upon this argument by reference to 
the arbitration clause and in particular the reference to the 
seat of arbitration contained in clause 14 which clearly states 
that any dispute arising out of the agreement shall be 
resolved through arbitration in Dubai, UAE pursuant to the 
rules of arbitration of Dubai International Financial Centre 
by a panel consisting of three arbitrators.  Learned counsel 
laid much emphasis on the intention of the parties to 
establish Dubai UAE as the seat of arbitration and no other 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
10
seat.  According to the learned counsel, Dubai refers to the 
on-shore juridical seat of Dubai, subject to the federal 
arbitration laws of UAE, as distinguished from an off-shore 
jurisdiction, that is, Dubai International Financial Centre 
which has been established as a special economic free zone.  
Learned counsel for SpaceCom did not rebut the proposition 
that these were two different jurisdictions and were 
governed by separate streams of law.  Indeed DIFC is a 
special economic free zone and has been separated from 
Mainland Dubai in the applicability of laws and in particular 
laws relating to arbitration.  The rules of DIFC-LCIA which 
have been formulated by the arbitral institution set up in 
DIFC would be rules of arbitration in cases coming before 
DIFC courts in which arbitration is held under the auspices 
of DIFC courts.  Therefore, the question is clearly one of 
jurisdiction and goes to the competence of DIFC-LCIA to 
embark upon arbitration in this matter where the parties had 
clearly mentioned Dubai UAE as the seat of arbitration.  It is 
clear that the defence raised by Wateen is covered by Article 
V (1)(d) of the 2011 Act for this Court to determine whether 
the defence is sustainable and on that basis the recognition 
and enforcement of the Awards may be refused. 
Determination: 
20. Learned counsel for Wateen while expanding his 
defence reiterated that the seat of arbitration is pivotal in any 
arbitration proceedings and cannot be brushed under the 
carpet.  It constitutes a vital defence envisaged by the 2011 
Act and is analogous to an exclusive jurisdiction clause.  
This Court ought to refuse the recognition and enforcement 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
11
of the award on this basis.  The seat of arbitration in this 
case was Dubai UAE and not DIFC which are different 
jurisdictions and have separate application of laws.  Dubai is 
one of the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates.  
Following Article 104 of the United Arab Emirates 
Constitution, 1971 (“UAE Constitution”), Dubai has its 
own judicial hierarchy comprising of the Court of First 
Instance (which hear all claims related to civil and 
commercial matters), the Court of Appeal, and the Court of 
Cessation, established since 1970.  In relation to arbitration 
proceedings, as codes of procedures is a federal subject 
under Article 121 of the UAE Convention, the law 
applicable in Dubai was set out in UAE civil Procedure 
Code, enacted through the Federal Law No.11 of 1992.  The 
Federal Law No.11 of 1992, in other words, sets out the 
procedural law applicable to arbitrations seated in Dubai.  In 
2018, UAE enacted Federal Law No.6 of 2018 (on 
arbitration0, which amended the Federal Law No.11 of 
1992. 
 
Learned 
counsel 
referred 
to 
the 
constitutional 
amendment No.1 of 2004 which inter alia provides that; 
“…the order and the manner of establishing Financial 
Free Zones and the boundaries within which they are 
exempted from having to apply rules and regulations of the 
Union.” 
 
21. It is clear in terms of the Constitution of UAE that the 
Union has the authority to establish financial free zones and 
the boundaries within which they are exempted from having 
to apply rules and regulations of the Union.  By the federal 
decree No.35 for the year 2004, Dubai International 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
12
Financial Centre was established as a financial free zone in 
the Emirates of Dubai which was followed by law No.9 of 
2004 in respect of DIFC.  Law No.9 of 20004 established a 
Centre, that is, DIFC which was meant to have financial and 
administrative independence and inter alia had dispute 
resolution authority as one of its attached bodies.  It was 
envisaged that an Arbitration Institute would be established 
under the Centre to perform its functions independently in 
accordance with the Centre’s laws and the constitution of the 
Arbitration Institute which will be promulgated by a 
resolution of the President.  It was clearly provided by 
Article X that Centre establishments shall carry out their 
activities in accordance with the Centre’s laws, Centre’s 
Regulations and the licenses issued to them.  By Article 13 it 
was unambiguously provided that the Centre’s bodies and 
Centre establishments shall carry on their commercial 
activities in accordance with the Centre’s laws and 
Regulations.  By clause 2 of Article 13 it was specifically 
clarified 
that 
the 
Centre, 
Centre’s 
Bodies, 
Centre 
establishment and their employees and their delegates shall 
not be governed in relation to matters within the 
jurisdiction of the Centre by the laws of the Emirates 
and the rules and regulations of any local government 
body.   
22. A reference to the provisions of law No.9 of 2004 
leaves it in no manner of doubt that DIFC established by the 
law would have an independent and separate existence and 
would be governed by its own laws as distinct from the laws 
of Emirates.  DIFC Law No.10 of 2004 is, in essence, the 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
13
civil procedure code applicable in DIFC.  Article 30 of the 
DIFC Court Law 2004 allows the DIFC courts to not only 
apply the laws applicable in DIFC or such law as is agreed 
between the parties but not the laws applicable in the rest of 
UAE.  DIFC Law No.1 of 2008, enacted in 2008 by the 
Ruler of Dubai was legislated as the arbitration law 
applicable in DIFC.  Thus, it cannot be argued with any 
degree of certainty that DIFC and Dubai UAE could be 
referred to interchangeably as one and the same entity for 
clearly they have separate sets of laws.  The intention to 
place them in different compartments has a palpable purpose 
and must be given effect as this would assume significance 
in the context of the defence set up by Wateen.  To 
substantiate this argument, learned counsel for Wateen 
referred to a decision made by DIFC court in claim No.CFI 
011/2009 decided in the judicial authority of the Dubai 
International Financial Centre by the court of first instance.  
In that case, the question squarely was whether the seat was 
DIFC or Dubai UAE.  It was stated in the decision that 
different laws applied in DIFC as distinguished from Dubai 
UAE and the two terms were clearly not synonymous or 
interchangeable.  Further if the parties want DIFC law to 
apply and DIFC courts to have jurisdiction over an 
arbitration, they should expressly select DIFC as the seat of 
their arbitration agreement. 
Tribunal’s decision regarding jurisdiction: 
23. It will be recalled that Wateen filed a suit before the 
Civil Courts at Lahore in August 2016.  To counter that 
SpaceCom filed an anti-injunction suit in DIFC court.  The 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
14
DIFC court not only decided the plea of injunction brought 
by SpaceCom but also went on to decide the question 
regarding seat of arbitration.  The suit was titled ‘SpaceCom 
International LLP and Wateen Telecom (Pvt.) Ltd etc. and 
was fixed before the court of first instance DIFC courts.  In 
the ruling rendered by Justice Sir Jeremy Cook it was held 
that: 
“…The law which governs the agreement is that of the 
Commonwealth of Virginia in the USA but no evidence has 
been put before me as to that law, so for current purposes it 
is to be treated as the same as the law in DIFC. That is the 
only law which can fall to be applied at present. If the 
position is that the DIFC is the seat of the arbitration, 
then the DFIC court is the supervisory court and its 
jurisdiction and power to grant the interim injunction is 
undoubted...” 
 
24. In the final ruling rendered on 09.03.2017 the issue 
relating to injunction as well as the seat of arbitration was 
decided but was more specifically elaborated in a ruling 
issued at later stage as a clarificatory ruling made pursuant 
to the request of the lawyers representing both parties in 
relation to orders and judgments given earlier and in 
particular the judgment of 25 February and the order of 9 
March 2017.  In the clarificatory ruling the following 
determination with regard to the seat of arbitration was 
rendered: 
“This and the judgment of the same date made it plain 
beyond doubt, that the Court had decided that the seat of 
the arbitration was the DIFC and that the parties were 
bound by an agreement to arbitrate in the DIFC under 
DIFC/LCIA Rules and could not arbitrate elsewhere. The 
ad hoc arbitration, commenced in case the Court should 
find that there was no binding agreement to arbitrate under 
DIFC/LCIA Rules, was therefore the subject of the 
injunction also.” 
 
25. Thus, DIFC court decided that the seat of arbitration 
was DIFC and the parties were bound to arbitrate in the 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
15
DIFC under DIFC-LCIA rules and could not arbitrate 
elsewhere.   
26. Wateen joined issue before the Arbitral Tribunal and 
once again raised the question of jurisdiction reiterating its 
earlier stance regarding lack of competence in DIFC courts 
to enter upon arbitration proceedings asserting instead that 
the seat of arbitration had to be Dubai UAE as consented to 
by the parties in the arbitration agreement.  The Arbitral 
Tribunal determined the said issue which is stated in the 
Award in paragraphs 184 to 196.  The Tribunal laid much 
emphasis on the decision of 9 March, 2017 by DIFC court 
while making the final anti-suit injunction and holding that 
the seat of arbitration was DIFC.  The entire discussion of 
the Tribunal hinged upon the decision of DIFC court.  In 
paragraph 196 it was stated that: 
“196. The Tribunal thus decides that the DIFC Court had 
jurisdiction to issue the interim anti suit injunction 
pursuant to the DIFC Arbitration Law and the JAL and 
that it had jurisdiction to make that injunction final, and 
to interpret the arbitration clause in doing so, by virtue of 
the Respondent’s failure to invoke the arbitration clause 
pursuant to Articles 13(1) of the DFIC Arbitration Law and 
Article 11(3) of the New York Convention. ” 
 
27. By a strange set of reasoning the Tribunal handed a 
decision regarding the competence of DIFC court to issue 
interim anti-suit injunction.  The Tribunal thus perched itself 
in a dominant position over and above the DIFC court and 
endorsed the act of DIFC court in assuming jurisdiction to 
issue anti-suit injunction as well as a decision on the seat of 
arbitration.  There is further discussion regarding this aspect 
in paragraphs 203 to 208 of the award.  Finally it was 
concluded that: 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
16
“210. The Tribunal thus decides that the DIFC Court’s 
decision of 9 March 2017 on the final injunction, it Order 
with reasons of 23 May 2017 and its clarificatory ruling of 
23 May 2017 all became final and binding on the parties. 
 
216. The Tribunal thus decides that the DIFC Court’s 
decision of 9 March 2017 on the final injunction and its 
clarificatory ruling of 23 May 2017 are each a res judicata 
as between the parties.  
 
28. In a nub, the Tribunal’s conclusion was based on the 
findings of DIFC court regarding the seat of arbitration and 
it was held by the Tribunal that the decision of DIFC court 
operated as an issue preclusion regarding jurisdiction and 
therefore could not be reagitated before the Tribunal.  This 
was clearly a fallacy on the part of the Tribunal.  In the first 
instance, the DIFC court should not have gone beyond the 
case before it in seeking an interim injunction filed by 
SpaceCom to decide on the question of seat of arbitration as 
well.  Secondly, there was no warrant to hold that this aspect 
of the decision operated as res judicata between the parties 
and the Tribunal was precluded from entering on this 
controversy afresh.  While doing so, the Tribunal abdicated 
its power which is vouched by respectable authority to 
decide the question of jurisdiction and has a purpose stated 
in a large number of authorities on the subject. 
29. It is well established that the arbitrators are entitled to 
inquire into the merits of the issue whether they have 
jurisdiction or not, not for the purpose of reaching any 
conclusion which will be binding upon the parties but for the  
purpose of satisfying themselves as a preliminary matter 
whether they ought to go on with the arbitration or not.  This 
was explained in an English case reported as Christopher 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
17
Brown Ltd. v Genossenschaft Osterrreichischer [1954] 1 
QB 8, 12-13 contained in the following passage: 
“It is not the law that arbitrators, if their jurisdiction is 
challenged or questioned, are bound immediately to refuse 
to act until their jurisdiction has been determined by some 
court which has power to determine it finally. Nor it is the 
law that they are bound to go on without investigating the 
merits of the challenge and to determine the matter in 
dispute, leaving the question of their jurisdiction to be held 
over until it is determined by some court which had power 
to determine it. They might then be merely wasting their 
time and everybody else’s. They are not obliged to take 
either of those courses. They are entitled to inquire into the 
merits of the issue whether they have jurisdiction or not, 
not for the purpose of reaching any conclusion which will 
be binding upon the parties  - because that they cannot do 
– but for the purpose of satisfying themselves as a 
preliminary matter whether they ought to go on with the 
arbitration or not. It has become abundantly clear to them, 
on looking into the matter, that they obviously had no 
jurisdiction as, for example, it would be if the submission 
which was produced was not signed, or not properly 
executed or something of that sort, then they might well take 
the review that they were not going to go on with the 
hearing at all. They are entitled, in short, to make their own 
inquiries in order to determine their own course of action, 
and the result of that inquiry has no effect whatsoever upon 
the rights of the parties. ” 
 
30. Courts have recognized the autonomy of forum 
selection clause in international trade. “Agreeing in advance 
on a forum acceptable to both parties is an indispensable 
element in international trade, commerce and contracting” 
(Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co. 407 U.S. 1, 13-14 and that 
a choice of forum is “an almost indispensable precondition 
to achieving the orderliness and predictability essential to 
any international business transaction”. (Scherk v. Alberto 
Culver Co. 417 U.S. 506-519).  It has also been recognized 
that the New York Convention was enacted to promote the 
enforcement of international arbitration agreements and 
favours enforcement of arbitration clauses according to the 
intent of the contracting parties Louis Dreyfus Commodities 
Suisse S.A. v. Acro Textile Mills Limited (PLD 2018 Lahore 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
18
597).  It was held in Zaver Petroleum Cop. Ltd. v. Saif 
Energy Ltd. (C.S No.1 of 2019) (IHC) that “party autonomy 
is considered as the cornerstone of arbitration.  There is 
indeed no prohibition on two Pakistani parties from opting 
for a foreign seat of arbitration.”  The Tribunal must follow 
the procedure that is agreed upon by the parties.  In 
Encyclopaedia Universalis SA v Encyclopaedia Britannica 
Inc. (2nd Cir. 2005), a U.S Court emphasized the importance 
of upholding the parties’ agreement and held: 
“While we acknowledge that there is a strong public policy 
in favour of arbitration, we have never held that courts must 
overlook agreed-upon arbitral procedure in deference to 
that policy.  The federal policy is simply to ensure the 
enforceability according to their terms, of private 
agreements to arbitrate.” 
 
31. Learned counsel for Wateen relied upon a judgment of 
the United States Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit“ 
POLIMASTER LTD. v. RAE SYSTEMS, INC., 623 F.3d 
832” for the proposition that this Court as the Enforcing 
Court may review de novo the question whether a party 
established its defence to enforcement of arbitral award 
under the New York Convention.  No doubt, the party 
raising the defence has the burden of showing the existence 
of a New York Convention defence which burden is 
substantially high and the public policy in favour of 
international arbitration is strong.  It is also axiomatic that in 
any such inquiry we must begin with the language of the 
parties arbitration agreement (the case law in this regard has 
been cited with approval in Polimaster).  It was further held 
on the basis of a plethora of judgments that the choice of 
forum was presumptively enforceable.  Finally, on the basis 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
19
of facts in that case, it was held that the enforcing court may 
refuse an enforcement of award if it is the result of 
procedures that are contrary to the parties’ agreement.  The 
issue that arbitration was not conducted at the seat of 
arbitration agreed by the parties or the forums so selected, 
would constitute a defence under the New York Convention 
and on this basis the enforcement of an award may be 
refused. 
32. The courts in the United Kingdom have thoroughly 
explored the principle of de novo review in relation to 
Article V of the Convention in the landmark judgments in 
litigation between Dallah Real Estate and Tourism Holding 
Company and the Ministry of religious Affairs, Government 
of Pakistan:  
(a) In Dallah v Pakistan [2008] EWHC 1901, Aikens J in 
Queen’s Bench Division held at Para 82 to 83. 
“…so far as English law is concerned, the matters set out in 
paras (a)-(f), including issues of foreign law, are all matters 
of fact. 
 
Thus a party must be entitled to adduce all evidence 
necessary to satisfy the burden of proof on it to establish the 
existence of one of the grounds set out in s 103(2). I accept, 
of course, that questions of issue estoppel may arise (as in 
this case), which would prevent one or other party re-
fighting issues of fact that have already been specifically 
argued and decided, as between those parties, on the merits 
by a competent tribunal. But, subject to that constraint, it 
seems to me that the statutory wording of s 103(2) requires 
that the party wishing to challenge the recognition and 
enforcement of a Convention award must be entitled to 
ask the court to reconsider all relevant evidence on the 
facts (including foreign law), as well as apply relevant 
English Law.” 
 
  
Aiken J held, at Para 149, the arbitral tribunal’s 
determinations on the validity of the arbitration 
agreement did not create an issue estoppel.  

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
20
  
The Court found that there was no valid 
arbitration agreement between Dallah and Pakistan and 
refused to recognise and enforce the foreign award made 
in Paris, France against Pakistan.  
(b). Dallah’s appeal against the judgment of the Queen’s 
Bench Division was dismissed. The Court of Appeal 
endorsed the views of Aikens J. Dallah filed a further 
appeal before the Supreme Court of United Kingdom.  
(c) The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom dismissed 
Dallah’s appeal in Dallah v Pakistan [2010] UKSC 46. 
In reaching this decision,  
(i). Lord Mance, at Para 30, concluded that the arbitral 
tribunal’s own view of its jurisdiction has no legal or 
evidential value: 
“The nature of the present exercise, is, in my opinion, also 
unaffected where an arbitral tribunal has either assumed 
or, after full deliberation, concluded that it had jurisdiction 
there is in law no distinction between these situations. The 
tribunal’s own view of its jurisdiction has no legal or 
evidential value, when the issue is whether the tribunal had 
any legitimate authority in relation to the Government at 
all. This is so however full was the evidence before it and 
however carefully deliberated was its conclusion. It is also 
so whatever the composition of the tribunal – a comment 
made in view of Dallah’s repeated (but no more attractive 
for that) submission that weight should be given to the 
tribunal’s 
“eminence” 
“high 
standing 
and 
great 
experience”. The scheme of the New York Convention, 
reflected in ss. 101-103 of the 1996 Act may give limited 
pirma facie credit to apparently valid arbitration award 
based on apparently valid and applicable arbitration 
agreements, 
by 
throwing 
on 
the 
person 
resisting 
enforcement the onus of proving one of the matters set out 
in Article V(1) and s. 103. But that is as far as it goes in 
law. Dallah starts with advantage of service, it does not 
also start fifteen of thirty love up.””” 
 
(ii) Lord Collins, after framing the issue of whether an 
English court can refuse to recognise and enforce an 
arbitral award issued by “a former Law Lord and a doyen 
of international arbitration, a former Chief Justice of 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
21
Pakistan and an eminent Lebanese Lawyer” (at Para 99,) 
concluded that enforcement courts are bound to revisit 
the issues that relate to serious and fundamental 
structural integrity of arbitration proceedings (at Para 
102 to 104)  
“But article V safeguards fundamental rights 
including the right of a party which has not agreed 
to arbitration to object to the jurisdiction of the 
tribunal. As van den Berg, the New York Arbitration 
Convention of 1958 (1981) puts it, at p 265: “In 
fact, the grounds for refusal of enforcement are 
restricted to causes which may be considered as 
serious defects in the arbitration and award… In 
Kanoria v Guinness [2006] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 701, 706, 
May LJ said that section 103(2) concerns matters 
that go to the “fundamental structural integrity of 
the arbitration proceedings.” 
Nor is there anything to support Dallah’s theory 
that the New York Convention accords primacy to 
the courts of the arbitral seat, in the sense that the 
supervisory court should be the only court entitled 
to carry out a re-hearing of the issue of the existence 
of a valid arbitration agreement; and that the 
exclusivity of the supervisory court in this regard 
ensures uniformity of application of the Convention. 
There is nothing in the Convention which impose an 
obligation on a party seeking to resist an award on 
the ground of the non-existence of an arbitration 
agreement to challenge the award before the courts 
of the seat.  
It follows that the English court is entitled (and 
indeed bound) to revisit the question of the 
tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction if the party 
resisting enforcement seeks to prove that there was 
no arbitration agreement binding upon it under the 
law of the country where the award was made” 
 
(iii) Lord Saville held that the arbitral tribunal’s ruling on 
its jurisdiction cannot even be the starting point of the 
analysis of the arbitration agreement. Lord Saville held at 
Paras 158 to 159: 
“In the present case the arbitrators have made a 
ruling, as they were doubles entitled to do under the 
doctrine of kompetenz kompetenz, that there was an 
arbitration agreement between the parties, so that 
they were able to hear and decide the merits of the 
case, which they then proceeded to do. However, 
under Section 103 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (as 
under the New York Convention itself) the person 
against whom the award was invoked has the right 
to seek to prove that there was no arbitration 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
22
agreement between the parties, so that in fact the 
arbitrators had no power to make an award. The 
question at issue before the court, therefore, power 
to make an award. The question at issue before the 
court, 
therefore, 
was 
whether 
the 
person 
challenging the enforcement of the award could 
prove there was no such agreement.  
In these circumstances, I am of the view that to take 
as the starting point the ruling made by the 
arbitrators and to give that ruling some special 
status is to beg the question at issue, for this 
approach necessarily assumes that the parties have, 
to some extent at least, agreed that the arbitrators 
have power to make a binding ruling that affects 
their rights and obligations; for without some such 
agreement such a ruling cannot have any status at 
all.” 
 
33. Wateen submits that Lord Saville’s views above merit 
particular attention. Lord Saville’ views signpost the 
circularity of the logic in which the Parties would fall if the 
tribunal’s own views as to its jurisdiction are taken as the 
starting point.  I tend to agree that where the question is one 
of the Parties’ selection of the seat of arbitration, the 
judgment of the disputed seat’s court has no value or special 
status. The enforcement court needs to conduct a de novo 
review of the Parties’ evidence and submissions to 
determine the seat of arbitration.  
34. This Court is not precluded in any sense whatsoever 
from conducting a de novo review of the Respondent’s 
evidence and submissions with reference to Article V(I)(d) 
of the convention. In Dallah, Lord Collins has suggested a 
step further and stated that the enforcement court is “indeed 
bound” to revisit the issues relating to Article V of the 
Convention. As such, this Court is required by the Article V 
of the Convention to conduct a fresh review of the Parties’ 
evidence to assess whether the grounds enumerated in 
Article V of the Convention are met or not. 

C.O No.25854 of 2023

Seat of Arbitration: 
35. In the law of arbitration seat is a matter of crucial 
significance.  It has a purpose and surely it is not a painting 
to be looked at without more.  Learned counsel for the 
respondent has rightly relied upon the case of ST Group Co. 
Ltd. & 2 others v Sanum Investments Ltd. [2019] SGCA 65 
decided by the Singapore Court of Appeal to set aside an 
arbitral award while relying upon Article V(1)(d) of the 
Convention.  Two consequences, according to ST Group Co. 
follow the selection of seat of arbitration: 
“(a). First, the selection of the seat of arbitration by the 
Parties contains in itself the choice of the procedural/curial 
law of arbitration. Law of seat of arbitration is the 
procedural law of arbitration proceedings. The Court 
explained at Para 96: 
“The choice of an arbitral seat is one of the most important 
matters for parties to consider when negotiating an 
arbitration agreement because the choice of seat carries 
with it the national law under whose auspices the 
arbitration shall be conducted.” 
(b). Second, the selection of the seat of arbitration by the 
Parties designates the system of courts that would have 
supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration and would be 
the forum of remedies against the arbitral awards. The 
Court observed at Para 98: 
“In addition to the external relationship with national 
courts, the law of the seat is also vital in governing 
significant issues relating to the conduct of an international 
arbitration and the validity and finality of the award 
resulting from the proceedings. The choice of the seat in 
and of itself represents a choice of forum for remedies.” 
Following the principle, the Court observed at Para 101 
that “the English courts have gone further [and] observed 
that “an agreement as to the seat of the arbitration” is 
“analogous to an exclusive jurisdiction clause”. Therefore, 
“any claim for a remedy going to the existence or scope of 
the arbitrator’s jurisdiction or as to the validity of an 
existing interim or final award is agreed to be made only in 
the courts of the place designated as the seat of the 
arbitration.” 
 
36. Reference may also be made to the case of Enka v. 
Chubb [2020] UKSC 38 which states that: 
“1. Where an international commercial contract contains 
an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration, at least 
three systems of national law are engaged when a dispute 
occurs. They are: the law governing the substance of the 
dispute; the law governing the agreement to arbitrate; and 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
24
the law governing the arbitration process. The law 
governing the substance of the dispute is generally the law 
applicable to the contract from which the dispute has 
arisen. The law governing the arbitration process 
(sometimes referred to as the “curial law”) is generally the 
law of the “seat” of the arbitration, which is usually the 
place chosen for the arbitration in the arbitration 
agreement. These two systems of law may differ from each 
other. Each may also differ from the law which governs the 
validity and scope of the arbitration agreement.” 
 
37. The above statement of law regarding arbitration is 
premised on a plethora of judgments and derives support 
from the case law handed down by the courts across various 
jurisdictions.  The seat of arbitration relates to the law 
governing the arbitration process and entails in itself a 
selection of curial / procedural law, that is, national law 
under whose supervision the arbitration shall be conducted.  
For the elaboration of these concepts one may allude to the 
Treaties, Russell on Arbitration (21st Edition) which have 
been updated in the subsequent editions of the same 
Treaties.  The seat or place of arbitration has been explained 
in Russell is as follows: 
“2-097 The “seat” or place of arbitration. Like other 
jurisdictions, England regard it as essential for an 
arbitration to have a “seat”, a geographical location to 
which the arbitration is ultimately tied and which 
prescribes the procedural law of the arbitration. The parties 
are free to choose a seat, or specifically, a procedural law 
of the arbitration, which may be different from the proper 
law of the contract and the proper law of the arbitration 
agreement. English law does not recognise the possibility of 
“delocalised” arbitral procedures which do not have a 
connection with any national system of law. Under English 
law the procedural law of an arbitration is generally the 
law of the country in which the arbitration has its seat. 
The parties’ choice of a seat is therefore extremely 
important, not simply in relation to the proper law of the 
contract, but also because the law of a particular seat may 
contain provisions which have important consequences 
for the conduct of the proceedings. The expression “seat” 
is often used to refer to the particular city chosen, rather 
than the country (for example, “arbitration in London”) 
and while the parties’ agreement is on a city, the crucial 
choice is of the jurisdiction in which the city is located. An 
effective choice of procedural law can always be made 
without reference to a specific venue for the arbitration, but 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
25
by specifying a jurisdiction: but this is much less common. 
The seat is the legal, rather than the physical, place of 
arbitration proceedings, and hearing can be held in other 
jurisdictions.” 
 
38. Thus, an arbitration must have a seat which signifies a 
geographical location to prescribe the procedural law of the 
arbitration.  There is an autonomy and freedom which 
inheres in the parties to choose a seat (specifically 
procedural law of the arbitration) and which, according to 
Russell and the case law on which it is based, may be 
different from the proper law of the contract and the proper 
law of arbitration agreement.  Thus, the parties’ choice of 
the seat is extremely important simply because the law of a 
particular seat may contain provisions which have important 
consequences for the conduct of the proceedings.  It has 
further been stated in Russell that the seat is the legal rather 
than physical place of arbitration proceedings and it does not 
matter whether hearings are held physically at the seat 
chosen by the parties or some other jurisdiction.  This will 
not detract from the fact that the seat of arbitration chosen 
by the parties will be the curial law of arbitration.  The 
contractual wording of clause 14 makes clear that the parties 
to MSA 2014 resolved that the seat of arbitration would be 
Dubai, UAE.  Clause 14 of the agreement goes on to state 
further that arbitration shall be pursuant to the rules of 
arbitration of DIFC.  This, however, does not depreciate the 
primary argument regarding the seat of arbitration and the 
reference to the rules of DIFC (though the parties agree that 
there are no rules of DIFC as such) has connection with the 
conduct of the arbitration proceedings to be in accordance 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
26
with such rules.  The parties, therefore, selected the 
procedural rules of arbitration proceedings independently 
from the seat of arbitration.  It is conceded in any case that 
DIFC has no independent rules of arbitration which have 
been formulated by DIFC-LCIA, which is an arbitral 
institution, distinct and separate, though within DIFC’s 
jurisdiction.   
39. Russell further alludes to the concept of hearings in 
different location to state that: 
“Hearing 
in 
different 
locations. 
In 
international 
arbitrations meeting or hearings may take place in several 
countries, without changing the seat. In these cases it is 
important not to confuse the seat with what is simply the 
appropriate or convenient geographical location for 
particular hearings. It will be necessary to ensure that any 
mandatory local law requirements of the place where the 
meeting or hearing takes place are complied with.”(2-104) 
 
40. It is now an established principle of arbitration that 
while the law of an arbitration agreement usually follows the 
proper law of the main contract, an arbitration agreement is 
separable from the main contract between the parties and an 
arbitration agreement may have a different law from that of 
the proper law.  As to what matters are covered by the 
procedural law, the concept has been explicated in Russell to 
mean that: 
“An exhaustive list of the matters covered by the procedural 
law of an arbitration is not possible: their nature and scope 
are determined by the law of the particular country. 
Conflicts may thus arise between the procedural law, the 
proper law of the contract and the law of the arbitration 
agreement or the law of the place of enforcement, 
particularly in relation to questions of arbitrability and 
validity, appointment of an arbitral tribunal, time limits, 
and the form and validity of the award. Under English law, 
in the absence of agreement, the procedural law of the 
arbitration normally determines questions relating to the 
appointment and revocation of the authority of the 
arbitration tribunal. For example where English law is the 
procedural law a party is able to apply to the court in 
relation to the appointment of an arbitrator where the other 
party does not concur. The procedural law also governs the 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
27
powers and duties of the arbitral tribunal, and remedies for 
breach of duty are also to be ascertained from the 
procedural law. The availability of interim and procedural 
remedies from the court, and the exclusion of such 
remedies, is also governed by this law, as are challenges to 
the award and the question of which law is to apply to the 
substance of the dispute...”  
 
41. The list given above is not exhaustive as the statement 
itself admits.  But the instances which have been referred 
and the challenges if brought, would certainly feed through 
the result of the decision-making process in arbitral 
proceedings.  Some of them, if sustained, would be fatal to 
the decision.  In the factual context of the present case, the 
distinction in jurisdictions of courts at Mainland Dubai, 
UAE and DIFC courts has already been underscored and 
leads indubitably to conclude that they operate under 
separate legal systems.  The parties thus consciously and 
unmistakably chose Dubai as the seat of arbitration and it is 
unarguable on SpaceCom’s part to contend otherwise.  
Learned counsel for SpaceCom in his arguments in this 
Court asserted that clause 14 was drafted by Wateen but the 
parties understood at all times that DIFC was to be the seat 
of Arbitration.  This argument cannot prosper.  Drafting of 
clause 14 loses significance when both parties signed the 
contract.  Further, no material has been brought forth to 
establish the intentions of parties in the form of 
correspondence exchanged between parties prior to 
execution of contract.  After the arbitration was triggered, 
Wateen’s stated position did not waver and continued to be 
pegged to the notion of Dubai as the seat of Arbitration.  
(Email of 25.7.2016).  Procedural objections were taken not 
only before the DIFC court but also before the Arbitrators.  

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
28
These acts are sufficient to hold that at no point of time did 
Wateen forego its objection regarding seat of Arbitration.  If 
we rummage through the emails exchanged with DIFC-
LCIA one is driven to hold that the discourse revolved 
around which rules will apply to arbitral proceedings (since 
DIFC had no rules), rather than on the question respecting 
seat of arbitration which was a more fundamental question.  
There is a palpable keenness on the part of DIFC court to 
assume jurisdiction in the matter in order to keep the 
arbitration within DIFC.  This appetite to latch on to the 
arbitration permeates the orders which were handed down.  
There is no discussion by DIFC court on the issue of seat of 
Arbitration in the judgment of 9 March 2017 which was 
given ex-parte as Wateen refused to appear while stating in a 
letter that “they had not been given sufficient time and also 
suggesting that the court had a closed mind.”  Such a 
judgment could hardly be termed as res judicata between the 
parties on the issue of seat. 
Dubai as the seat of Arbitration: 
42. Wateen submits that the Tribunal wrongly conducted 
the arbitration in DIFC against the express agreement of the 
parties which has been explained by reference to historical 
facts and timelines.

“Any dispute arising in connection with or out of the

arbitration in accordance with the Rules of 
Conciliation and Arbitration of the International 
Chamber of Commerce by three (3) arbitrators 
appointed in accordance with said Rules unless the 
parties agree on one (1) arbitrator. The arbitration 
proceedings shall be conducted in Dubai in the 
English Language.” 
MSA 2014, Clause 14  “Any dispute arising out of or in connection with 
this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or 
validity hereof, shall be resolved through arbitration 
in Dubai U.A.E. pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration 
of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)”  
 
43. It is submitted by Wateen that the history of the 
contracts between the Parties demonstrate that the Parties 
manifestly understood the distinction between the seat of 
arbitration (and its consequences) and procedural rules 
applicable to the arbitration. The Parties selected Dubai as 
the seat of arbitration in all four agreements above but 
selected arbitration rules of the ICC in MSA 2007, MSA 
2013 and the Settlement Agreement whereas the non-
existent “the Rules of Arbitration of the Dubai International 
Financial Centre (DIFC)” in MSA 2014. The Parties could 
have but did not change the status of Dubai as the seat of 
arbitration in MSA 2014. To read the arbitration agreement 
in any other way would be contrary to the intention of the 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
30
Parties, as expressed in the arbitration agreement set out in 
MSA 2014, and presume that the Parties, despite being 
sophisticated entities, did not know the difference between 
the seat of arbitration and procedural rules applicable to the 
arbitration.  
44. In insisting on DIFC as the seat of arbitration, the 
Applicant has conflated: (a) the seat of arbitration with 
procedural rules applicable to the arbitration; and (b) the seat 
of arbitration with the appointing authority (in case of 
deadlock in the appointment of the third arbitrator) in Clause 
14 of the MSA 2014. The Parties often select appointing 
authorities, such as presidents of arbitral institutional and 
other reputable bodies, to appoint an Arbitration Tribunal in 
case of a deadlock between the Parties in relation to the 
appointment. The object and purpose of these selections is to 
embody efficiency in the arbitration agreement and not to 
designate the seat of arbitration. If the Parties wanted their 
arbitration to be seated in DIFC, the Parties would have 
stated so expressly in their arbitration agreement. 
45. The historical facts above are undisputed and have 
been brought forth by Wateen to demonstrate that in the 
historical context the parties manifestly understood the 
distinction between the seat of arbitration and the procedural 
rules applicable to the arbitration.  At all times, the parties 
selected Dubai as the seat of arbitration in all four 
agreements whereas the arbitration rules were differently 
selected to apply to the agreement to arbitrate.  It would be a 
fallacy on the part of the applicant/ SpaceCom to confuse 
the two concepts and to assert that notwithstanding the seat 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
31
of arbitration to be Dubai UAE, since the procedural rules 
applicable were those of DIFC, the arbitration proceedings 
ought to be held at DIFC as the seat of arbitration.  On this 
basis, Wateen has made out a case that the arbitral award 
does not merit recognition and enforcement under the laws 
of Pakistan as it is not the result of arbitration that the parties 
had bargained for which was an arbitration in Dubai as 
opposed to DIFC. 
46. There are two conflicting strands of judgments of DIFC 
courts relied upon by both the parties.  But the 
overwhelming view is that “if parties want the DIFC 
Arbitration Law to apply and the DIFC courts to have 
jurisdiction over an arbitration, they should expressly select 
the DIFC as the seat in their arbitration agreement.”  
(Gaetan inc. v Geneva Investment Groups LLC [2015] ARB 
010 ).  These judgments do not require an expansive 
dissection by this Court since they do not even have 
persuasive value in arriving at a conclusion. 
47. In addition to the judgments of DIFC courts, the DIFC-
LCIA Arbitration Centre—which prescribes accessible 
norms on drafting of arbitration agreements based on 
expertise and experience—recommended the parties to 
expressly mention DIFC as the seat of arbitration next to the 
seat/ place of arbitration for designation of DIFC as the seat 
of arbitration.  The DIFC-LCIA Arbitration Centre’s model 
arbitration clause states: 
Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this 
contract, including any question regarding its existence, 
validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally 
resolved by arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the 
DIFC – LCIA Arbitration Centre, which Rules are 
deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
32
 
The number of arbitrators shall be [one/three] 
 
 The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be [City 
and/or Country] (See Footnote) 
 
 The language to be used in the arbitration shall be [ ]. 
 
The governing law of the contract shall be the 
substantive law of [ ]. 
 
Footnote: If the intention is to choose Dubai 
International Financial Centre/DIFC as the seat, insert 
"Dubai International Financial Centre" or "DIFC" 
here. 
 
48. 
In 
addition, 
Rule-1 
of 
the 
DIFC-LCIA 
Arbitration Rules state:  
“Where any agreement, submission or reference 
provides in writing and in whatsoever manner for 
arbitration under the rules of the DIFC-LCIA Arbitration 
Centre, the parties shall be taken to have agreed in 
writing that the arbitration shall be conducted in 
accordance with the following rules (the Rules) or such 
amended rules as the DIFC-LCIA Arbitration Centre that 
the Court of LCIA (the LCIA Court) may have adopted 
hereafter to take effect before the commencement of the 
arbitration.” 
 
49. 
The 
DIFC-LCIA 
Arbitration 
Centre’s 
recommended arbitration clause is, unsurprisingly, 
consistent with the judgment in Dhir and Gaetan. The 
Parties did not follow either the prescriptions of the 
DIFC courts or the recommendation of the DIFC-LCIA 
Arbitration Centre. When read with the Parties 
contractual history, the only conclusion that can 
emerge is that the Parties unambiguously chose Dubai 
– and not DIFC – as the seat of arbitration. If the 
Parties had any other intention, the Parties would have 
(following clear instruction in DHIR, Gaetan, and the 
DIFC-LCIA Arbitration Centre’s model arbitration 
clause) stated so in their arbitration agreement.  
50. 
In the present case, the DIFC-LCIA refused to 
even register the First Request for Arbitration dated 18 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
33
June 2015 because the arbitration agreement did not 
expressly refer to the arbitration rules to the DIFC-
LCIA Arbitration. The Applicant then commenced the 
Second Request for Arbitration on 26 June 2016 and 
pressed for an ad hoc arbitration (i.e., an arbitration not 
conducted under the auspices of any arbitration 
institution). Only after the issuance of the injunctions 
of the DIFC court, the Applicant again initiated the 
arbitration before the DIFC-LCIA Arbitration Centre 
by submitting the Third Request for Arbitration on 9 
August 2017. Thus, in the absence of judgments of the 
DIFC courts, the DIFC-LCIA Arbitration Centre had 
declined jurisdiction in relation to the arbitration 
initiated by the Applicant. Even though the arbitration 
agreement did not designate DIFC as the seat of 
arbitration, the DIFC court assumed supervisory 
jurisdiction over the arbitration based on the 
misreading of the chosen seat of arbitration and read 
the arbitration rules of the DIFC-LCIA Arbitration 
Centre into the arbitration agreement between the 
Parties. 
51. 
So the significance of the seat of Arbitration 
must not be lost on the parties or for that matter on the 
courts adjudicating such issues.  This is a fundamental 
issue and should remain relevant at all stages of any 
arbitration.  It cannot be rendered non est on the 
misplaced 
notions 
of 
approach 
in 
favour 
of 
enforcement and causality.  It was argued that the 
procedural defect must be essential to the award and 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
34
prevents outcomes where new arbitral proceedings 
would eventually lead to the same result.  This is based 
on a treatise, New York Convention, edited by Dr. 
Reinmar Wolff (second edition 2019).  This argument 
could prosper in respect of a procedural defect but the 
seat of arbitration is a jurisdictional fact and determines 
the curial / procedural law of the arbitration.  The 
parties’ choice of a seat is therefore extremely 
important because the law of a particular seat may 
contain provisions which have important consequences 
for the conduct of the proceedings.  The list of matters 
covered by the procedural law of an arbitration has 
been set out in Russell.  To allege that none of those 
arose in these proceedings would be taking a simplistic 
view of the entire issue.  If Wateen had brought a 
challenge on any of the procedural issues before DIFC 
courts, it would be precluded from raising the issue by 
way of defence under Article V. Wateen was thus 
caught in a quandary and cannot be faulted on this 
account. 
52. 
Wateen would also be confronted by another 
issue.  In view of the meandering jurisprudence and 
since the stance on preclusion is not uniform in all 
contacting states, a respondent that fails to attack the 
award at the seat of arbitration may find itself able to 
resist enforcement in some jurisdictions, but may fail to 
prevent enforcement in others. It is stated in New York 
Convention: 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
35
“Courts from several common law countries have 
held that the failure to initiate setting-aside 
proceedings at the seat of the arbitration does not 
preclude a party from resisting enforcement in 
proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of 
the award.  According to the Hong Kong Court, the 
losing party has a choice between both options.  
This was also the position adopted by the UK 
Supreme Court in Dallah real Estate v. Ministry of 
Religious 
Affairs, 
Pakistan. 
 
Similarly, 
the 
Singapore Court of Appeal, citing the above 
decisions, held that the enforcement regime of 
Article 36 of the Model Law (which is modelled on 
the enforcement regime of Article V) affords the 
party resisting enforcement a choice of remedies.” 
 
53. 
The position has been summed up by Wolff in 
the following paragraph: 
“The position taken by the majority of courts in the 
more recent case law is in line with the concept that 
arbitral awards are subject to dual control. Where 
an award suffers from a defect under Article V, the 
losing party may, in principle, choose to attack the 
award in annulment proceedings at the seat of the 
arbitration. However, it is, in principle, not bound to 
do so. In particular, in cases in which the losing 
party does not have any assets in the country of the 
seat of the arbitration or where the law at the seat of 
arbitration does not afford effective legal remedies 
against the award, it may also choose to restrict its 
defense against the award to the proceedings for 
recognition and enforcement. Such behavior does 
not conflict with the prohibition of venire contra 
factum proprium as an underlying principle of the 
Convention. However, this is not without risk in 
practice: since the stance on preclusion is not 
uniform in all Contracting States, a respondent that 
fails to attack the award at the seat of the 
arbitration may find itself able to resist enforcement 
in some (or even most) jurisdictions, but may fail to 
prevent enforcement in others.”  
 
54. 
Thus the choice of forum is crucial in the 
context of seat of arbitration and the rule of dual 
control would suffer a serious setback if the agreed 
procedure were not followed. 
55.  
United Nations Commission on International 
Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has issued a Guide on the 
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of 
Foreign Arbitral Awards. It affirms the prevalence of 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
36
party autonomy in the context of Article V(1)(d) in the 
following analysis: 
“9. 
Article V (1)(d) expressly affirms the 
supremacy of the parties’ agreement concerning the 
composition of the tribunal procedure, and that the 
law of the place of arbitration should apply only 
“failing such agreement.”  Courts have consistently 
recognized that the grounds enumerated in article V 
(1)(d) must be measured, in the first instance, 
against the agreement of the parties.” 
  
56. 
These observations are premised on a Report by 
the Secretary-General, Recognition and Enforcement of 
Foreign Arbitral Awards, E/2822, Annex II.  The 
agreement of the parties, thus, retains primacy 
concerning arbitral procedure.  Although the standard 
of proof for showing that the agreed arbitral procedure 
was breached is high and the burden is substantial, yet 
the agreement regarding the seat is a core arbitral 
procedure and the prerequisite of causality is not 
attracted. This defect is essential to the award and 
constitutes a ground for refusal. 
56. 
Article V(1)(d) has two types of potential 
violations, concerning 
—the composition of the arbitral Tribunal; 
—the  arbitral procedure. 
(See, ICCA's Guide to the Interpretation of the 1958 
New York Convention, A Handbook for Judges, relied 
upon by SpaceCom.).  According to this Guide, the 
second option of Article V(1) (d) is aimed at more 
fundamental deviations from the agreed procedure, 
which includes situations in which the parties agreed to 
use the rules of one institution but the arbitration is 
conducted under the rules of another. Reference has 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
37
been made in the Guide to the decision of a Turkish 
court of appeals which refused recognition and 
enforcement of a Swiss award on the ground that the 
procedural law agreed upon by the parties had not been 
applied. (Turkey: Court of Appeals, 15th Legal 
Division, 1 February 1996, Yearbook Commercial 
Arbitration XXII (1997) pp. 807-814). This is a clear 
case of deference to parties’ autonomy and the whole 
structure of arbitration agreements is built around this 
concept. The point of agreeing a seat is to agree that the 
law and the courts of a particular country will exercise 
control over an arbitration which has its seat in that 
country to the extent provided for by that country's 
laws. A choice of seat can in these circumstances aptly 
be regarded as a choice of the curial law.  Whether the 
seat was DIFC or Dubai mainland, it was irrational for 
DIFC courts to insist that jurisdiction lay with them to 
decide upon all procedural challenges. This is all the 
more 
perverse 
when 
we 
analyse 
SpaceCom's 
uncertainty on the issue. SpaceCom was always in 
doubt as to the seat of arbitration.  This is evident from 
the correspondence and emails exchanged between the 
parties and with DFIC-LCIA.  Hence the invoking of 
the doctrine of contra proferentum by SpaceCom. 
57. 
In the written brief submitted by Space Com, 
states that "both parties have acknowledged that Clause 
14 of 2014 MSA contains a pathology".  This Court has 
not come across any acknowledgment of the kind by 
Wateen.  The brief then goes on to refer to the “role of 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
38
an Arbitration Court in interpreting a pathological 
clause” to conclude that the intent was on designating 
DIFC as the seat when using the words "arbitration in 
Dubai, UAE.” This conclusion is unsupported by 
evidence and based upon a view which could not 
reasonably be held. The use of the term ‘pathological’ 
for a clause in an agreement is inapt and does not 
comport with legal jargon. SpaceCom cannot rely on 
such a term to steer clear of any liability and, in the 
same vein, to invite this Court to interpret the clause in 
its favour while imputing an intention to parties which 
cannot be discerned. SpaceCom argues that judgments 
have held that the word "Dubai" can be interpreted to 
include DIFC. This argument has no legal basis in view 
of the discussion above on the distinct status of the two 
in terms of their legal systems. Finally SpaceCom 
submits that “Applicant was forced to approach the 
DIFC due to the Respondents constant attempts to 
frustrate the arbitration proceedings”. This statement 
clearly establishes that DIFC was chosen by SpaceCom 
to suit its best interests and was not what the parties 
intended in Clause 14.  This is the ineluctable inference 
from the statement set out above. 
Contra Profrentem Rule: 
58. 
During oral arguments, SpaceCom invoked the 
contra profrentem rule to its aid repeatedly.  Suffice to 
say that the rule has no application in this matter.  The 
rule is only applicable where there is ambiguity in the 
agreement.  Clause 14 of MSA 2014 does not suffer 

C.O No.25854 of 2023 
 
39
from any ambiguity in relation to the seat of arbitration, 
in my opinion.  If the parties have equal bargaining 
strength (which, doubtless, is the case here) then the 
rule is inapplicable.  They are also sophisticated 
entities 
engaged 
in 
international 
commercial 
transactions. 
59. 
In Persimmon Homes Ltd. v Ove Arup & 
Partners Ltd [2017] EWCA Civ 373, the Court of 
Appeal of the United Kingdom constricted the 
applicability of the rule and held at Para 52: 
“The contra proferentem rule requires any 
ambiguity in an exemption clause to be resolved 
against the party who put the clause forward and 
relies upon it.  In relation to commercial contracts, 
negotiated between parties of equal bargaining 
power, that rule now has a very limited role.” 
 
Conclusion: 
60. 
In sum, Wateen has furnished proof that the 
composition of the arbitral authority and the arbitral 
procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of 
the parties in terms of Article V (1)(d) of the 
Convention and thereby undermines the legitimacy of 
the Awards.  The recognition and enforcement of the 
Awards is thus refused.  Application dismissed with 
costs.
