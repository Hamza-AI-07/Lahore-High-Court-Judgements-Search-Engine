Through this petition, petitioner has called 
in question the action of respondents whereby in 
compliance of notice dated 18.05.2024, father of 
petitioner has been detained by adopting procedure 
of Land Revenue Act, 1967 for recovery of 
outstanding amount without its determination by 
the court of competent jurisdiction. 
2. 
The claim of the petitioner is that Electricity 
meter bearing Reference No. 29152630591500R 
was installed in the name of grandfather of the 
petitioner namely Allah Bakhsh s/o Ahmed Khan 
(who has passed away), regarding the said 
electricity meter an illegal amount as arrears 
amounting Rs.83,56,398/- was imposed by the 
respondents/MEPCO, 
the 
said 
act 
of 
the 
respondents was called in question by the legal 
heirs of the Allah Bakhsh through Writ Petition 
No.19439/2023 tilted as "Muhammad Ibrahim etc 
Versus WAPDA etc." before this Court, which is 

 
W.P. No. 6368 of 2024 
2 
 
still under adjudication. However, side by side, the 
respondent No.3 firstly issued notice Under 
Section 82(1) of the Land Revenue Act 1967 for 
recovery of aforementioned amount in the name of 
Allah Bakhsh s/o Ahmad Khan on 14.05.2024 and 
subsequently the respondent No.3 issued notice 
dated 16.05.2024 in the name of detenue (father of 
the petitioner namely Abdul Ghafoor) with the 
subject for detention of the defaulter of MEPCO 
Circle Dera Ghazi Khan, with the warning to the 
detenue for payment of aforementioned liability of 
MEPCO, 
furthermore, 
vide 
notice 
dated 
18.05.2024 the detenue is being detained for 30-
days. It is claimed that the impugned act of the 
respondents for initiating the recovery proceedings 
against the detenue/father of petitioner, the 
issuance of detention notice/order and all ancillary 
proceedings are illegal, against the law, facts, 
without 
lawful 
authority, 
without 
lawful 
justification and the same are nullity in the eye of 
law, hence, are liable to be set aside. 
3. 
Notice was issued to respondents in 
response to which learned Legal Advisor for 
MEPCO has entered appearance to contest the case 
on behalf of MEPCO and WAPDA. Both the 
Assistant Attorney General and the Learned Law 
Officer have defended the order of arrest of father 
of petitioner in compliance of notice dated 
18.05.2024 for recovery of WAPDA dues as 
arrears or Land Revenue.  
4. 
The Learned counsel for the respondents 
have been confronted the question as to whether 
the afore-referred amount has been got determined 
from any court of competent jurisdiction, in 

 
W.P. No. 6368 of 2024 
3 
 
response to which learned Legal Advisor states 
that respondent authorities themselves are the final 
Authorities to determine the outstanding amount, 
against which notice was issued to father of the 
petitioner under Section 82(1) of Land Revenue 
Act, 1967 for recovery of said amount and on his 
failure to make payment of outstanding dues, 
father of petitioner has been arrested.  
5. 
Needless to mention that the claim of the 
petitioner is that amount sought to be recovered 
from the father of the petitioner has not yet been 
determined and the electricity connection has not 
been installed in the name of father of the 
petitioner rather in the name of his grandfather and 
liability against the father has not been established 
in any case, hence recovery from his father is not 
sustainable. 
6.  
The question of recovery of dues of 
electricity department as arrears of land revenue 
came up for hearing before courts in various cases. 
7. 
In 
case 
titled 
Water 
and 
Power 
Development Authority versus Umaid Khan 
reported as [1988 CLC 501 (Lahore)] the question 
related to recovery of enhanced dues where 
demand notice had been issued by Authority to 
consumer having evaluated cost of material to be 
supplied to him for giving him electric connection 
when Authority had reserved no right that amount 
demanded through notice could be enhanced 
unilaterally or on account of enhancement in price 
of material. This Court held that the Authority 
would not be entitled to recover amount 
subsequently enhanced unilaterally by it on pretext 
that price of material supplied to consumer had 

 
W.P. No. 6368 of 2024 
4 
 
gone up as amount sought to be recovered from 
consumer was neither due from him nor 
outstanding against him, hence Authority would 
not be entitled to recover amount from consumer 
as arrears of land revenue under Section 54-A of 
Electricity Act, 1910. 
8. 
In case titled Shamim-ud-Din versus 
Federal 
Government 
of 
Pakistan 
through 
Chairman WAPDA, Lahore and 4 others reported 
as [1995 CLC 299 (Lahore)], detention of the 
detenue was declared to be without lawful 
authority and detenue was set at liberty while 
holding that a Director of limited company could 
not be detained for recovery of charges of supply 
of energy recoverable as arrears of land revenue 
whereas the Company could be proceeded against 
in accordance with law.  
9. 
In case titled Pakistan Industrial Credit and 
Investment Corporation Ltd. versus Ali Gul Khan  
reported as (1989 CLC 1774) the Peshawar High 
Court while considering a question of recovery of 
electricity dues as arrears of Land revenue held 
that Water and Power Development Authority is 
neither empowered to levy any cess nor falls 
within the definition of term ‘State’. Authority is 
empowered only to charge the consumers of 
electricity for the energy supplied to them and that 
is also the position under Section 54-A of 
Electricity Act, 1910. Authority’s charges for the 
supply of electricity do not come within the 
definition of a tax or a cess and amounts to be 
recovered by the Authority may be deemed to be 
the charges for services rendered. Charges of 
Authority were neither land revenue nor arrears of 

 
W.P. No. 6368 of 2024 
5 
 
land revenue but simply charges under the 
provisions of Section 54-A of Electricity Act, 
1910. Such charges have been made recoverable as 
arrears of land revenue but mere fact that the 
charges of Authority have been made recoverable 
as arrears of land revenue does not mean that such 
sums 
have 
become 
land 
revenue 
or 
any 
Government dues. 
10. 
The Sindh High Court in case titled Mst. 
Shanti versus Karachi Transport Corporation 
and others (2000 CLC 595), which considering the 
scope of provisions of Section 79 & 80 of West 
Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 1967 relating to 
Recovery of Government dues as arrears of land 
revenue observed that all the provisions of law 
which authorize any statutory authority to recover 
any amount as arrears of land revenue can be 
invoked only after determination of the amount of 
dues as fixed ascertained and determined sum of 
money.  
11. 
This Court in case titled Muhammad 
Siddique versus Khawaja Maqbool Ahmad, Naib-
Tehsildar (Revenue), Kot Adu and 3 others [2000 
PCrLJ 17 (Lahore)] while considering the liability 
of a particular person to be liable to proceedings 
under Land Revenue Act, 1967 for recovery of 
dues held that no person other than the owner of 
the land was liable to pay Agricultural Income tax 
in his lifetime and detenue who was a tenant on the 
land could not be held liable to pay tax in default 
of the owner and was set at liberty especially when 
no proceedings for recovery as arrears of Land 
revenue started against the owners.  

 
W.P. No. 6368 of 2024

12. 
 This Court in case titled Muhammad Jamil 
Shahid versus Sub-Divisional Officer, Electricity 
WAPDA, Muridke  reported as [1997  PCrLJ  863 
(Lahore)] in a Habeas corpus petition under 
section 491 of Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C) 
challenging detention of detenue under Sections 81 
and 82 of West Pakistan land revenue Act (XVII 
of 1967) for non-payment of arrears of electricity 
charges held that arrest and detention of any 
person under Section 82 of the West Pakistan land 
revenue Act, 1967 could not take place without 
having issued to him a prior notice in terms of 
Section 81 thereof. No such notice was issued to 
the detenue and even the amount regarding arrears 
of electricity charges due against him was not 
determined, 
Detention 
of 
detenue, 
in 
the 
circumstances, was illegal and he was directed to 
be set at liberty accordingly.  
13. 
From the perusal of the aforementioned case 
law it is apparent that by now it is settled that 
unless an amount is determined by a court of 
competent jurisdiction, the same cannot be 
recovered as arears of land revenue. Reliance in 
this behalf is also placed upon judgments reported 
as “Mukhtar Ahmad Bhatti Vs. Deputy Director 
Food Bahawalpur, etc.” (2007 MLD 324), 
“Muhammad Jamil Shahid Vs. Sub-Divisional 
Officer, etc.” (1997 P.Cr.L.J 863), “Abdul Karim 
Vs. Province of Sindh through Secretary, 
Communication and Works and 03 others” (2001 
MLD 
69), 
Messrs 
Pakistan 
Pipe 
and 
Construction 
Company 
Limited 
v. 
City 
Mukhtiarkar, Karachi East and others (PLD 
1984 Kar. 28), Muhammad Akbar Cheema v. 

 
W.P. No. 6368 of 2024 
7 
 
Province of West Pakistan and another (1984 
SCMR 1047), Agricultural Development Bank of 
Pakistan v. Sanaullah Khan and others (PLD 
1988 SC 67), Mumtaz Ahmed Silk Mills Limited 
v. District Sindh Employees' Social Security 
Institution and another (1987 CLC 2531), 
Province of Punjab v. Muhammad Azam, (1989 
SCMR 1419) and Messrs Health Construction 
Company (Pvt.) Ltd. v, Faisalabad Development 
Authority, Faisalabad (1995 CLC 1877).  
14. 
In the present case proceedings under Land 
Revenue Act for recovery of dues as arrears have 
been initiated without getting determination of 
liability from any forum of competent jurisdiction 
including court of law. Besides, the procedure 
envisaged under Section 81 and 82 of Land 
Revenue Act, 1967 has also not been properly 
adopted, therefore, this petition is allowed with the 
result that arrest and detention of father of 
petitioner in terms of Sections 81 and 82 of Land 
Revenue Act, 1967 without determination of 
outstanding amount from any court of competent 
jurisdiction is declared to be illegal and without 
any legal effect, consequently the same is set 
aside. Father of the petitioner shall be released 
forthwith.
