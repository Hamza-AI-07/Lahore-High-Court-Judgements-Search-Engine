06.11.2024 Mr. Azmat Islam Ghilzai, Advocate for petitioner.  
 
 
 
 
Petitioner, 
Ghulam 
Fareed 
who 
was 
defendant No.2 in a suit for possession filed by 
Muhammad Bilal, Respondent No.1, has called in 
question dismissal of his application under Section 
12(2) C.P.C. by Additional District Judge vide 
impugned order dated 20.04.2024 by stating that as 
the decree was obtained by the respondent No.1 
through fraud and misrepresentation, therefore, by 
allowing the aforementioned application the said 
decree should have been set aside, hence, seeks 
reversal of the impugned order on the ground that 
the same is not sustainable. 
2. 
Perusal of the record shows that respondent 
No.1, Muhammad Bilal filed suit for possession of 
land measuring 14-marlas, bearing Khata No.298, 
Khasra No.30/31 in Mauza Shah Jamal, Tehsil and 
District, Muzaffargarh against the petitioner and 
Atta Muhammad, respondent No.2 on 05.03.1994 
by contending that he had purchased land in 
dispute from respondent No.2 vide registered sale 
deed dated 12.10.1993 Exh.P4 and thereafter 
possession was handed over to respondent No.2 as 
tenant vide agreement of the same date for rent of 
Rs.500/- per month who had sub-let the same to 
petitioner without any authority and refused to 
return the possession of the property resulting in 
filing of the suit for possession. The petitioner 

C.R. No. 574 of 2024 
 
2 
 
contested the said suit by claiming to have 
purchased the property through mutation No.885 
for Rs.100,000/- on 10.01.1994 exhibited as P2 
and D1 fee of which was deposited in the treasury 
on 02.10.1993 which was prior to its transfer to the 
respondent No.1 and claimed that sale deed in 
favour of respondent No.1 was a fraudulent 
document. The respondent No.2 through written 
statement affirmed the sale deed but denied having 
taken possession of property on rental basis.  After 
recording of evidence the said suit was dismissed 
on 15.11.1997 by the Civil Judge, Muzaffargarh by 
declaring the sale deed of respondent No.1 as 
based on fraud and collusion and that transfer in 
favour of petitioner was genuine, however, on 
27.11.1997 appeal filed by respondent No.1 was 
accepted by the Additional District Judge, Kot 
Addu, Muzaffargarh on 07.09.1998 with the result 
that findings of the trial court were reversed and 
the suit was decreed in favour of Respondent No.1 
by upholding his sale deed, against which 
petitioner filed C.R. No.569-D of 1998 before this 
Court on 22.09.1998 which was dismissed on 
merits by this Court on 08.10.2015 and findings of 
the Additional District Judge were upheld by 
holding that respondent No.1 was owner of the 
property and that the petitioner had not been able 
to establish transfer/sale in his favour as he had 
withheld best evidence so adverse presumption 
was drawn against him and by placing reliance on 
judgment reported as “Rasool Bakhsh and another 
versus Muhammad Ramzan” (2007 SCMR 85), it 
was also held that registered instrument/sale deed 
attains presumption of truth and has preference 
over the mutation. Petitioner, thereafter, filed C.P. 
No.3522 of 2015 before Hon’ble Supreme Court of 

C.R. No. 574 of 2024 
 
3 
 
Pakistan which was withdrawn on 06.03.2020 in 
the following terms: 
 
“After arguing the case at some length ASC 
for the petitioner seeks permission to withdraw this 
petition in order to resort to other remedies which 
may be available to the petitioner under the law. 
Dismissed accordingly.” 
 
3. 
Thereafter, petitioner filed application under 
Section 12(2) C.P.C. before learned Additional 
District Judge on 01.02.2024 which was dismissed 
on 20.04.2024 and the said order is under challenge 
through this revision petition. The application under 
Section 12(2) C.P.C. filed by the petitioner has 
been dismissed as not only being time barred but 
also not maintainable. Perusal of the record shows 
that decree passed by Additional District Judge 
dated 07.09.1998 has merged into order dated 
08.10.2015 passed by this Court in C.R. No.569-D 
of 1998, therefore, said order was final order in the 
matter and application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. 
filed by the petitioner before Additional District 
Judge was not maintainable and has rightly been 
dismissed on that account for the reason that 
application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. is required 
to be made before the court that has passed the final 
decision, which principle of law has been affirmed 
by the Supreme Court in judgment reported as 
“Province of Punjab through Collector, Sialkot 
versus Muhammad Irshad Bajwa” (1999 SCMR 
1555) which provides that competent forum to 
challenge the validity of judgment, decree or order 
under Section 12(2), C.P.C. is the Court which 
passed the final order. 
4. 
In the present case, the final order had been 
passed by the High Court as the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court 
had 
not 
entertained 
the 
petitioner’s 
application for leave to appeal against the same. 

C.R. No. 574 of 2024 
 
4 
 
Reliance in this regard is placed on judgments of 
the Supreme Court in case titled “Khawaja 
Muhammad Yousaf versus Federal Government 
through Secretary, Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and 
Northern Areas and others” (1999 SCMR 1516) 
where in it is held that if Supreme Court merely 
reaffirms a judgment or order of a High Court by 
refusing leave, the final judgment in terms of 
Section 12(2), C.P.C. will be of the High Court and 
not of the Supreme Court. If, however, Supreme 
Court reverses a judgment of a High Court and 
records a finding on question of fact or law contrary 
to what was held by the High Court, in that event 
the final judgment or order would be of the 
Supreme Court for the purposes of Section 12(2), 
C.P.C. 
5. 
When confronted of the aforementioned legal 
position that the petitioner was required to file the 
application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. before the 
High Court and not the court of Additional District 
Judge, the learned counsel for the petitioner has 
argued that the respondents’ appeal had been 
allowed by the learned Additional District Judge by 
reversing the findings of the trial court, where after 
the order of the Additional District Judge was 
maintained by this court and then the petition for 
leave to appeal was withdrawn from the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court, hence, the petitioner is aggrieved 
of the order of the Additional District Judge which 
was maintained by Higher forums, consequently the  
petitioner 
had 
filed 
application 
before 
the 
Additional District Judge, which according to him 
was maintainable. It is pertinent to mention here 
that this argument of the petitioner is fallacious for 
the reason that supposing an order passed by the 
Civil Court/Trial Court is upheld up to this Court or 

C.R. No. 574 of 2024 
 
5 
 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court on merit and not on 
technical grounds, then this assertion of the 
petitioner would enable the aggrieved party to 
restart another round of litigation by filing 
application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. before the 
Civil Court by ignoring the findings affirmed by the 
forums above. Hence, this was not a valid ground to 
file application before the Additional District 
Judge. 
6. 
There is another aspect of the matter, which 
is whether the petitioner could file application 
under section 12(2) C.P.C. before the High Court, 
where he had already availed the remedy by filing 
Civil Revision against the order of Additional 
District Judge which was dismissed on merits is not 
presently in issue in this petition and has been left 
open to be considered and decided in some other 
case, lest the opinion if expressed herein without 
the matter currently being in dispute may prejudice 
the rights of either party. 
7. 
As regards the question that said application 
was barred by time or not, said aspect of the matter 
was not required to be decided in view of the fact 
that said application was not maintainable before 
Additional District Judge as already discussed 
above. Consequently, no ground to warrant 
interference in the impugned order is made out for 
the reason that the same does not suffer from any 
illegality, jurisdictional defect or mis-reading and 
non-reading of material available on record. 
8. 
In view of the above, this Civil Revision 
being devoid of merits stands dismissed.
