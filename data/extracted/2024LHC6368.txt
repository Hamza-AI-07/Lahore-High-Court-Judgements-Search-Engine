MASUD ABID NAQVI, J.  
Brief facts necessary for the 
adjudication of this lis are that the appellant/plaintiff  
(hereinafter called as ‘plaintiff’) filed a suit for recovery of 
Rs.760,000/- on the basis of pronote. After the acceptance of 
application for leave to appear and defend the suit by the learned 
trial Court, the respondent/defendant (hereinafter called as 
‘defendant’) contested the suit by filing written statement and 
raised certain legal as well as factual objections. Out of divergent 
pleadings of the parties, issues were framed, evidence of the 
parties was recorded by the learned trial Court and dismissed the 
suit with special cost u/s 35-A CPC of Rs.50,000/- vide judgment 
and 
decree 
dated 
31.01.2023. 
Feeling 
aggrieved, 
the 
appellant/plaintiff has filed instant appeal and challenged the 
validity of impugned judgment and decree dated 31.01.2023.

2. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the 
appellant and minutely gone through the record as well as the 
impugned judgment and decree. 
3. 
It is well settled law that under section 118 of the 
Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, there is an initial statutory 
presumption that the negotiable instrument is made, drawn, 
accepted or endorsed for consideration and in a case to contrary, 
the onus is on the person who is denying the consideration to 
prove the same. However, if the plaintiff presents facts contrary 
to the stated consideration in the pronote or which militate 
against the presumption then the presumption is lost/destroyed 
and the burden of proving the validity shifts to the plaintiff to 
prove that the pronote was executed by the defendant for 
consideration. In the instant suit, the plaintiff himself pleaded 
that due to the involvement of defendant’s son, an  
FIR No.689/2018 with offences u/s 392/411 of PPC was 
registered against him and the defendant being father of accused 
executed the disputed pronote/Ex.P-1 & receipt pronote/Ex.P-2 
with the clear undertaking/promise to pay an amount of 
Rs.760,000/- to plaintiff if his son namely Abid Ali was found 
involved in the crime and during the investigation, police 
declared his son guilty. On the refusal to honour his promise, the 
plaintiff was constrained to file suit against the defendant. The 
defendant completely denied the facts pleaded by the plaintiff. 
After carefully going through the alleged facts, pleaded by the

plaintiff himself in the plaint, there remains no doubt that the 
defendant did not receive 
any consideration for 
this 
pronote/Ex.P-1 & receipt/Ex.P-2 and the amount written in these 
exhibited documents is simply an imaginary figure which was 
not received by the executor. Hence, the alleged negotiable 
instrument is made or transferred without valid consideration and 
the negotiable instrument without consideration creates no 
obligation for the payment between the parties, according to 
Section 43 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881.  
 
Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872 also invalidates 
agreements if their considerations, objects or purposes are illegal, 
including those that violate public policy. Non-compoundable 
offenses are regarded as matters of public concern and permitting 
private agreements to settle such offences would compromise 
public interest and proper administration of justice. No court of 
law can countenance or give effect to an agreement which 
attempts to take administration of law out of hands of the judges 
and put it in the hands of private individuals. This policy is based 
on the principle that criminal prosecution in non-compounding 
offenses cannot be compounded at the free will and choice of the 
parties which is not a private dispute between them but is one in 
which society at large is interested and any private agreement by 
the person ostensibly aggrieved, in return for a reward, to forbear 
from or withdraw or abandon the prosecution knocks at the root 
of criminal justice. If such agreements are allowed to be enforced

by the courts, the doors will be opened to blackmailing on large 
scale. For instance, a man who loses or believes that he has lost 
something may frighten another by starting or threatening to start 
a case for theft against him or somebody in whom he is 
interested, then the later will often come around and in his 
anxiety to safe himself from harassment of trial, make an offer or 
execute a pronote or actually pay money. Therefore, the 
agreement to pay consideration for the pronote in the present 
case being the compounding of non-compoundable criminal 
charges is void in law. Hence, the learned trial Court has 
properly discussed in detail the pleadings as well as evidence 
adduced by both the parties and has elaborately discussed the 
factual as well as legal controversy between the parties and 
arrived at right conclusion, therefore, the findings of the learned 
Court below are hereby upheld/confirmed.     
4. 
Learned counsel for appellant/plaintiff has not been able to 
point out any infirmity, legal or factual, in the impugned 
judgement and decree passed by the learned trial Court. 
Therefore, the impugned judgment is maintained being well 
reasoned and in accordance with law and this appeal is 
accordingly dismissed in limine.
