SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:–The present 
civil revision, filed under section 115 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (the ‘Code’), is directed against judgment and 
decree dated 28.04.2023 passed by the learned Additional 
District Judge, Sargodha as well as judgment and decree dated 
18.03.2022 passed by the learned Civil Judge, Sargodha.  
2.  
Brief facts of the case are that the revision-
petitioner instituted suit dated 19.11.2015 (the ‘suit’) for 
specific performance of agreement to sell dated 13.08.2015 
(the ‘agreement’), with respect to the property measuring 
about 6 marla and 90 square feet, as further detailed in the 
plaint (the ‘suit property’). Per contents of the suit, the 
revision-petitioner agreed to purchase the suit property through 
the agreement for consideration of Rs. 65,00,000/-, out of 
which Rs. 27,00,000/- was paid as earnest money but the 
respondent failed to perform his part of obligations by

receiving the remaining consideration and passing on the title 
of the suit property to the revision-petitioner. The respondent 
instituted suit for partition on 08.07.2017 against Mukhtar 
Ilahi, Iftikhar Ilahi, Nisar Ilahi (sons of Muhammad Ilahi) and 
Mst. Kalsoom Azhar, Mst. Shaheen Mazhar (daughters of 
Muhammad Ilahi). The said suits were contested by the 
relevant parties and the following consolidated issues were 
framed:- 
 
1. Whether the plaintiff entered into an agreement to sell 
regarding the suit property with the defendant on 
13.08.2015 
against 
consideration 
amount 
of 
Rs.38,00,000/-? OPP 
 
2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get the decree as 
prayed for? OPP 
 
3. Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action to file this 
suit? OPD 
 
4. Whether the plaintiff has filed this suit just to harass 
and pressurize the defendant and suit of the plaintiff is 
liable to be dismissed? OPD 
 
5. Whether the plaintiff remained fail to pay remaining 
consideration amount within stipulated period? OPD 
 
6. Whether suit of defendant for partition is liable to be 
decreed? OPD 
 
7. Relief. 
Learned trial Court gave issues-wise findings. The suit filed by 
the revision-petitioner was dismissed and suit for partition filed 
by the respondent was decreed vide judgment and decree dated 
15.03.2022 and the respondent was directed to return the 
earnest money of Rs.27,00,000/- to the revision-petitioner. 
Being dissatisfied from the above judgment and decree, appeal 
No. 146 of 2022 was filed by the revision-petitioner, which 
was dismissed by the learned Appellate Court vide judgment 
and decree dated 28.04.2023. Aggrieved from the same the 
present civil revision has been instituted.  
 3. 
Mr. Shahid Mehmood Khan Khilji, learned 
counsel for the revision-petitioner has pressed this revision-
petition on the ground that time is not essence in the 

 
Civil Revision No. 36908 of 2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
3 
agreement. Learned counsel for the revision-petitioner has 
contended that in the cases of immoveable properties mere 
mentioning of the date in an agreement is not sufficient to 
construe the intention that the time is of essence. He relied on 
the case titled “Mrs. Zakia Hussain and another Versus Syed 
Farooq Hussain” (PLD 2020 SC 401). Learned counsel for 
the revision-petitioner has claimed that his case attracts second 
part of section 55 of the Contract Act, 1872 (the ‘Act’). 
Learned counsel for the revision-petitioner has added that the 
respondent rented out the suit property, thus, incapacitated 
himself to perform the agreement, as he was not in the position 
to give vacant possession.  
4.  
Malik Muhammad Imran Joiya, learned counsel 
for the respondent has disputed the above grounds by stating 
that the closing date is provided in the agreement, which is 
followed by clause of confiscation of earnest money upon 
failure to pay remaining consideration within the stipulated 
time, therefore, time is an essential clause of the agreement. 
He submitted that stance of alleged failure of the respondent to 
keep vacant possession by renting out the suit property or 
incapacity of the respondent to perform the agreement, is an 
afterthought and beyond the pleadings. 
5.  
A reading of the agreement reveals that the parties 
specifically 
agreed 
that 
the 
remaining 
payment 
of  
Rs. 3,800,000/- (thirty eight hundred thousand rupees) was 
required to be made by 13.11.2015. This is followed by a 
stipulation that upon failure of the same, the earnest money of 
Rs. 2,700,000/- (twenty seven hundred thousand rupees) shall 
be forfeited. There is nothing in the agreement that suggests 
that when entering into the agreement real intention of the 
parties was that time should not be an essential clause so that 
the revision-petitioner can get support from second part of 

 
Civil Revision No. 36908 of 2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
4 
section 55 of the Act. The intention of the parties to ensure the 
performance of obligations within the given time is further 
evident from the following answer of the revision-petitioner in 
his cross-examination:- 
 "
 ۔۔۔ ہی درتس ےہ ہک اعمدہہEx-P1
 
 امنیب رفنیقی یک ٹک ڈٹی(cut date)
 
رب لیمکت اعمدہہ یک یمتح اترخی13.11.2015
 یھت۔ ہی یھب درتس ےہ ہک ومرہخ
13.11.2015 وک ںیم وموجد ہن اھت۔۔۔" 
 
The unmistaken language of the agreement and 
close reading of evidence leave no doubt that the time, as 
postulated was of essence.  
6. 
In case titled “Muhammad Abdur Rehman 
Qureshi Versus Sagheer Ahmad” (2017 SCMR 1696), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed that in view of rapid 
increase in prices of immovable properties, seller cannot be left 
at the mercy of the buyer to bind him and then delay in 
completion of contract hiding behind an archaic legal principle 
that in contracts involving immovable properties, time is 
generally not of the essence. It is ruled that:- 
  “…This rule was settled many centuries ago 
when prices of real estate remained constant 
and stagnant for years on end. It is high time 
that this rule was revisited and revised keeping 
in view the changed circumstances and the 
ground realities of the real estate market. In this 
day and age, on account of rapid increase in 
population 
demand 
for 
real 
estate 
has 
increased….” 
  
 
 
(Underlining is added) 
7.  
While relying on above judgment, in case titled 
“Ms. Sara Bibi Versus Muhammad Saleem and Others” (PLD 
2021 Islamabad 236), the Court observed as follows:- 
  “… Gone are the days when, with respect to 
agreements for the sale of immovable properties, 
time was generally held not to be of the essence. 
In the case of Muhammad Abdur Rehman Qureshi 

 
Civil Revision No. 36908 of 2023          (Judgment) 
 
 
5 
v. Sagheer Ahmed (2017 SCMR 1696), even 
though time was held not to be of the essence for 
the performance of an agreement to sell an 
immovable property, the Hon’ble Supreme Court, 
set-aside the concurrent judgments decreeing the 
suit for specific performance of such an 
agreement. The inequitable conduct of the 
institution of the suit for specific performance 
with an inordinate delay during which time the 
value of the suit property had substantially 
increased furnished the ground for setting-aside 
the decree for specific performance.”  
   
      
 
 (Emphasis supplied)  
8.  
In the present case though the suit was filed soon 
after the final date settled by the parties for payment of 
remaining consideration but the revision-petitioner instead of 
depositing the remaining consideration at the time of filing of 
the suit, admittedly caused frustrating delay of about three and 
half years of institution of the suit for deposit of remaining 
consideration or in making such request to the learned trial 
Court. The revision-petitioner, in this regard, made the 
following admission: - 
"
 ۔۔۔ ہی درتس ےہ ہک 
 ںیم ےن دارئی دوعیٰ اسڑےھ نیت اسل دعب ہیقب رمق زرِنمث
عمج رکاےن یک دروخاتس زگاری۔۔۔" 
 
The revision-petitioner has even failed to 
demonstrate his willingness and / or capacity to perform the 
agreement as per the agreed terms, by failure to deposit 
remaining consideration or by making the request to the 
learned Court for three and half years of institution of the suit.  
9.  
Thereafter, 
the 
revision-petitioner 
clearly 
developed his case and adopted the stance that some tenants 
were having possession of the suit property and the respondent 
breached the condition of handing over vacant possession of 
the suit property. This was never the case of the revision-
petitioner when the suit was instituted. In the entire plaint no 
such fact is pleaded. The revision-petitioner was mindful of 

 
Civil Revision No. 36908 of 2023          (Judgment)

this during his examination, who deposed as under:- 
"
 ۔۔۔ ہی درتس ےہ

10.  
Order VI Rule 2 of the Code requires that the 
pleadings should contain a statement, in a concise form, of the 
material facts, on which the concerned party relies for his 
claim or defence. The allegations of failure of condition by not 
retaining possession or renting out the suit property form facta 
probanda. It was material fact and required to be pleaded and 
then to be proved through evidence. Such material fact when 
not pleaded, cannot be deposed in the evidence. Neither the 
evidence in departure of pleading of those material fact(s) can 
be given any weight. Reference can be made to the case titled 
“Muhammad Aslam and others Versus Muhammad Anwar” 
(2023 SCMR 1371).  
11.  
The findings of the learned two Courts below are 
found to be based on correct appreciation of evidence and law 
applicable thereupon. This petition is, therefore, dismissed. No 
order as to costs.
