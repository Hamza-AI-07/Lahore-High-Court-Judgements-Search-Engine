Punjab 
Mr. Arshad Pervaiz Qureshi, Assistant 
Advocate General with Riaz Ahmad, Senior 
Law Officer on behalf of Secretary Local 
Government & Community Development 
Department  
 
 
Raheel Kamran J:- Through this petition 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (‘the Constitution’), the petitioner has impugned the 
notifications dated 06.12.2023 issued by the Secretary Local 
Government & Community Development Department, South Punjab 
whereby he has been transferred from the post of Municipal Officer 
(Infrastructure), Municipal Committee, Vehari and directed to report 
to LG&CD Department (South Punjab) and respondent No.7 namely 
Nazar Hussain Sub-Engineer has been assigned additional charge of 
the said post.   
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the 
impugned transfer notification has been issued in disregard of 

2 
W.P.No.19036 of 2023 
security of tenure provided in section 186 of the Punjab Local 
Government Act, 2022 (‘the Act’).  According to him, the petitioner 
who was posted as Municipal Officer (Infrastructure), Municipal 
Committee, Vehari vide notification dated 16.09.2022 has been 
transferred and directed to report to Local Government and 
Community Development Department, Punjab vide impugned 
notification dated 06.12.2023 without completion of two years 
period.  He further contends that the impugned notification was 
passed during subsistence of ban imposed by the Election 
Commission of Pakistan through notification dated 15.08.2023. 
3. 
Learned Law Officer contends that the notification dated 
15.08.2023 issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan imposes 
restriction only upon posting and transfer of public official under the 
Federal 
and 
Provincial 
Governments 
and 
not 
the 
Local 
Governments, which difference is evident from clauses (c) and (d) of 
the notification, as the former does not mention the Local 
Governments whereas the latter does so.    He further contends that 
although the Act has been notified on 16.11.2022 yet the local 
governments under the Act are to be constituted after conduct of 
general elections.  He adds that under section 205(1) of the Act all 
offices of the defunct local governments constituted under the 
repealed Punjab Local Government Act, 2013 are presently 
providing public services without any interruption till new local 
governments are constituted under the Act.  He further adds that a 
public servant has no fundamental right with regard to posting, 
transfer and promotion.     
4. 
Arguments heard.  Record perused. 
5. 
Although a government servant has no vested right to remain 
posted at a place of his choice and he cannot insist that he must be 
transferred at any particular place yet if the transfer order is made in 
violation of any statutory provision, the Court can interfere with it.  
Admittedly, the petitioner was transferred at the present place of 
posting vide notification dated 16.09.2022 and he has been further 

3 
W.P.No.19036 of 2023 
transferred from the said place vide impugned notification after 
about one year and two months.  However, section 186 of the Act 
provides security of tenure to the Chief Officers and such other 
Officers of the local governments.  The same is reproduced 
hereunder: - 
“186. 
Security of tenure for the Chief Officer and other 
officers.-  All Chief Officers and such other officers of the local 
governments that may be specified by the Secretary from time to 
time, shall ordinarily hold office for a period of not less than two 
years.” 
 
After perusing the above provision of law, this Court has no 
hesitation in holding that ordinarily when a certain period of tenure 
has been provided to the officers by the legislature, it is the 
responsibility of the competent authority to abide by the same so that 
the benefit may be given to all such persons who are covered under 
the said law. Its execution cannot be left at the whims and wishes of 
the competent authority to grant this benefit or advantage on pick 
and choose basis.  However, use of the word “ordinarily” in section 
186 ibid saves power of the competent authority to deprive an 
incumbent of his security of tenure from holding office in 
extraordinary circumstances, for which purpose the order passed by 
the competent authority should manifest valid reasons.  I have also 
gone through the impugned notification of transfer wherein no 
reason including any exigency or public interest is mentioned.  
6. 
Although clause (c) of notification dated 15.08.2023 issued 
by the Election Commission of Pakistan only mentions the Federal 
and Provincial Governments and not the Local Government yet the 
impugned transfer notification has been issued by the Secretary 
Local Government & Community Development Department, 
Government of the Punjab (South Punjab), therefore, contention of 
the petitioner’s counsel that restriction imposed upon posting and 
transfer is not applicable to the officer of Local Governments, is 
misconceived.

W.P.No.19036 of 2023 
7. 
Insofar as provision of section 205(1) of the Act declaring 
that all offices, agencies and authorities of the defunct local 
governments shall continue providing public services without any 
interruption till such time new local governments are established,  
referred by the learned Law Officer is concerned, sub-section (2) 
thereof provides that all officers and servants of the defunct local 
governments shall continue to discharge their respective duties and 
exercise their powers with the successor local governments under 
this Act, therefore, contention of the learned Law Officer is 
misconceived. 
8. 
Since the petitioner is not claiming any vested right against 
any particular post but only wants implementation of security of 
tenure provided under section 186 of the Act and there is also a ban 
imposed by the Election Commission of Pakistan vide notification 
dated 15.08.2023, the impugned notification for transfer of the 
petitioner calls for interference by this Court.  Accordingly, this 
petition is allowed and impugned notification for transfer of the 
petitioner dated 06.12.2023 and the subsequent notification dated 
06.12.2023 are set aside.  However, nothing in this order shall be 
taken to restrict or prevent the competent authority to transfer the 
petitioner after expiry of the requisite tenure or where extraordinary 
circumstances so warranted, in accordance with law.
