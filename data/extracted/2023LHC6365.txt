JUDGMENT 
 
 
Date of hearing: 
20.7.2023 
For the Appellant: 
Mr James Joseph, Advocate. 
For the Respondents: 
Mr 
Muhammad

Rehman, 
Additional 
Prosecutor General, with Rana Gulfraz Ahmad/SI. 
 
 
  
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Appellant is on trial in case 
FIR No.13/2021 dated 8.1.2021 registered at Police Station Chab Kalan, 
Mian Channu, District Khanewal, for an offence under section 9(c) of the 
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 (the “Act”). The charge against 
him is that on 8.1.2021 at 5:00 p.m., he and his co-accused Yasir alias 
Yasri Chahdar and Rajad Hussain alias Rajadi were transporting 75 packets 
of charas weighing 1200 grams each (total: 90 kgs.) in an unregistered 
Toyota Corolla GLI car (Model 2019) when a police party led by Rana 
Gulfraz/ASI arrested them at Stop 102/15-L. Out of the said 75 packets, 
allegedly 35 were with the Appellant. During the proceedings, the 
prosecution called Rana Gulfraz/ASI as PW-2 to testify about the recovery. 
He produced the case property, which was exhibited as P-1/1-75. During 
his cross-examination on 4.5.2023,  the Appellant’s counsel requested the 
court to de-seal the case property which was allowed. When the 35 packets 
recovered from the Appellant were opened, it was discovered that 13 of 
them contained a mixture of soil and charas, while no sample was 
collected from 20. Samples were drawn from only two packets. On 
20.5.2023, the Deputy District Public Prosecutor filed an application 
praying that the complete case property be sent to the Punjab Forensic

Science Agency (PFSA) for analysis. The Additional Sessions Judge, Mian 
Channu, 
accepted 
that 
application

order 
dated 
3.6.2023  
(the “Impugned Order”). Aggrieved, the Appellant has filed this appeal 
under section 48 of the Act.

The learned counsel for the Appellant contends that re-
analysis of the material cannot be allowed in the peculiar facts and 
circumstances of the case. The Impugned Order is patently illegal and not 
sustainable. 
3. 
 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General has supported the 
Impugned Order. He contends that analysis of the entire case property 
would help the court arrive at the correct decision, thus fostering the ends 
of justice.

Arguments heard. Record perused.

The prosecution is required to prove the charge against an 
accused beyond a reasonable doubt. In drugs cases, it cannot succeed 
unless the report from the Government Analyst supports the witnesses who 
testify regarding the recovery and confirms that the recovered substance is 
contraband. The courts have issued guidelines from time to time to ensure 
that the report of the Government Analyst is authentic and reliable. 
Generally, they have opposed re-testing of the substance. In The State v. 
Amjad Ali (PLD 2007 SC 85), the Supreme Court observed that 
unscrupulous litigants are increasingly manoeuvring substitution of the 
substances and articles stored in the Malkhana. Following the replacement, 
these people request for the re-examination of the material, and the 
consequence is that what was originally tested as contraband is found to be 
something else. As a result, offenders get acquitted. The Supreme Court 
concluded: “It was about time the learned courts came alive to the said 
clandestine modus operandi adopted to screen offenders and made sure that 
once a substance had been tested, then extraordinary reasons must exist and 
must be given before directing fresh examination of such a substance.” 
This view was reaffirmed in Muhammad Aslam (Amir Aslam) and others 
v. District Police Officer, Rawalpindi and others (2009 SCMR 141), and 
Ameer Zeb v. The State (PLD 2012 SC 380).

In Muhammad Naeem and another v. The State and others 
(PLD 2019 SC 669), during the hearing of an appeal, the High Court 
directed fresh sampling of the alleged intoxicating material and sought a 
new report from the Chemical Examiner/Government Analyst. The 
Supreme Court set aside that order, holding as under: 
“Such judicial intervention is opposed to the adversary principle and 
offensive to the fundamental right of fair trial1 and due process2 
guaranteed under the Constitution. See Dildar v. State3; Painda Gul v. 
State4 and State v. Amjad Ali.5 The High Court has travelled beyond its 
lawful powers under section 423(1)(a) Cr.P.C. and has, in fact, directed 
to conduct a re-investigation or further investigation of the case, which is 
not permissible under the law.6 Even otherwise, calling for a fresh 
examination of the intoxicating substance at the appellate stage after all 
these years may frustrate the settled law7 as to safe custody and safe 
transmission of the recovered substance making the report of the 
Chemical Examiner suspect and unreliable.” 
7. 
 
In Qaiser Javed Khan v. The State and another  
(PLD 2020 SC 57), the Supreme Court stated that the Government 
Analyst’s report must show that the contraband was tested in accordance 
with a recognized standard protocol. Any test conducted without a protocol 
loses its reliability and evidentiary value. Therefore, the said report must 
specify (i) the test applied, (ii) the protocols applied to carry out those tests, 
and (iii) the results of the tests. It further stated that once these 
requirements, which are outlined in Rule 6 of the Control of Narcotic 
Substances (Government Analysts) Rules, 2001, are included in the 
Government Analyst’s report, any ambiguity can be resolved by the trial 
court by exercising its powers under the Proviso of section 510 Cr.P.C. 
which stipulates that the court may if it considers necessary in the interest 
of justice, summon and examine the person by whom such report has been 
made. Hence, while reviewing the report, the trial court can summon the 
Government Analyst to clarify any ambiguities. However, the Supreme 
Court cautioned that this does not allow the Government Analyst to 
conduct a fresh test or prepare a new report because doing so would

provide the prosecution with an opportunity to fill the gaps and lacunas in 
the report. 
8. 
 
Let’s get back to the case at hand. The trial court was required 
to describe the extraordinary circumstances that necessitated a  
re-examination of the case property. The Impugned Order is completely 
silent on this aspect. Even during the hearing of this appeal, the Additional 
Prosecutor General has failed to persuade us that any such circumstances 
exist.  
9. 
 
As adumbrated, all 35 packets (recovered from the Appellant) 
were opened with the trial court’s permission. It was found that samples 
were drawn from only two of them. That 13 packets had a mixture of soil 
and charas, and no sample was collected from the remaining 20. The trial 
court’s direction for sending the entire material to the PFSA gives the 
prosecution a premium to fill the lacunas. Such judicial intervention is 
contrary to the adversarial concept. It violates the fundamental right of fair 
trial and due process guaranteed by the Constitution as well as the 
principles settled by the above-mentioned judgments. 
10. 
 
In view of the above, we allow this appeal and set aside the 
Impugned Order dated 3.6.2023.
