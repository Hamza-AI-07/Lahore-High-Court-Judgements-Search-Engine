 Brief facts, as per statement/فرد بیان (Ex.PEE) got recorded by 
Muhammad Akram (complainant/PW-7) before Arshad Mehmood S.I.                 
(PW-13) on 11.07.2018 at 05:45 a.m., on the basis of which above mentioned 
F.I.R. (Ex.PEE/1) was registered, are that complainant/PW-7 is resident of 
Zaman Colony, Jauharabad and a labourer; marriage of his brother namely 
Muhammad Ajmal solemnized with Mst. Gulnaz in the year 2007, who have 
four children (1) Muhammad Fahad aged about 13-years (2) Abdullah 1½   
(3) Ghulam Ayesha aged about 10-years (4) Aasma Bibi aged about 6-years, 
who along with his wife and children is living in his own house at Riaz Town, 
Jauharabad; close relative of the complainant died in Chauha (چوہا) and for his 
Fateha Khawani "فاتحہ خوانی", they have to go along with brother Muhammad 
Ajmal in the early morning and for this purpose, complainant along with 
Shaukat Ali and Muhammad Irfan (brother) came from Zaman Colony, 
Jauharabad to Riaz Town, Jauharabad at the house of his brother Muhammad 
Ajmal at about 03:30 a.m.; gate of the Haveli of the house was open; when 
they all three entered into Haveli, they saw Mst. Gul Naz Bibi ("بھابھی"/sister-
in-law of the complainant) was holding a knife (چھری) in her hand and 
Muhammad Ajmal (brother), Fahad, Abdullah (paternal nephews of the 
complainant), Ghulam Ayesha, Aasma Bibi (paternal niece of the 
complainant) were lying smeared with blood; Gul Naz Bibi ("بھابھی"/sister-in-
law of the complainant) said that her husband Muhammad Ajmal used to 
torture her daily and due to this grudge, she has committed murder of her 
husband and children with knife (چھری) and hatchet; blood stained hatchet 
was also lying along with dead body; Mst. Gul Naz Bibi ("بھابھی"/sister-in-law 
of the complainant) has committed murder of Muhammad Ajmal (brother), 
Fahad, Abdullah, Ghulam Ayesha and Aasma with knife (چھری) and blows of 
hatchet; after leaving Muhammad Irfan (brother) and Shaukat Ali to guard the 
dead body, complainant was coming to report, however met with Arshad 
Mehmood S.I.   
 
After completion of investigation, challan report under Section: 173 
Cr.P.C. was submitted in the Court; appellant was formally charge sheeted but 
she pleaded not guilty and claimed trial whereupon prosecution evidence was 
summoned; after recording of prosecution evidence, appellant was examined 
under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. but she refuted the allegations levelled against her;

nor produced any evidence in her defence.

 Trial Court after conclusion of trial has convicted and sentenced the 
appellant 
as 
mentioned 
above 
through 
the 
impugned 
judgment                      
dated: 17.09.2019. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that conviction 
recorded and sentence awarded to the appellant through impugned judgment 
are against the „law and facts‟ of the case; ocular account is neither 
trustworthy nor corroborated/supported by any other independent evidence; 
prosecution has remained unable to prove its case. Learned counsel for the 
appellant finally prayed for acquittal of the appellant. 
5. 
Learned Additional Prosecutor General and learned counsel for the 
complainant have supported the impugned judgment and prayed for dismissal 
of the appeal.   
6. 
Arguments heard.  Record perused. 
7.  
It has been noticed that occurrence allegedly took place during the 
night of 11.07.2018 in the house of Muhammad Ajmal (deceased) situated at 
Riaz Town, Jauharabad, which according to Column No.4 of the F.I.R. 
(Ex.PEE/1) is at a distance of about 2-kilometers from the concerned police 
station i.e. City Jauharabad, District: Khushab, however, as per case of 
prosecution, Muhammad Akram (complainant/PW-7) along with Shaukat Ali 
(given-up PW) and Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) came at the place of occurrence 
at 03:30 a.m. when occurrence was already over, complainant went for 
reporting the occurrence, met Arshad Mehmood S.I. (PW-13), got recorded 
his statement to him at 05:45 a.m. which was sent to police station and F.I.R. 
(Ex.PEE/1) was chalked out at 06:05 a.m.; it is relevant to mention here that 
complainant  (PW-7) was also having motorcycle and relevant portions of his 
statement in this regard are as under: - 
“In the night of occurrence, I and my brother Irfan left our home at 
about 3.00 a.m. on motorcycle. We went to the house of Shaukat and 
took him with us. We reached at the house of Shaukat at about 3.20 
a.m. night.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    (emphasis added) 
 
 “I left the place of occurrence at about 5.30 a.m. to report the matter to 
police. The police met me near the main tower in Burhan Town. The 
police was on patrol duty on official vehicle at that time.”  
 
Therefore, it cannot be termed as promptly registered case and this state of 
affairs suggests that possibility of deliberation, consultation and concoction 
cannot be ruled out. It is well settled that when there is delay in reporting the 
incident to the police, then prosecution is under obligation to explain such 

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.297/2019.

delay and failure to do that will badly reflect upon the credibility of 
prosecution version. In this regard, guidance has been sought from the case of 
“Mst. Asia Bibi versus The STATE and others” (PLD 2019 Supreme 
Court 64); relevant portion from paragraph No.29 of said case law is hereby 
reproduced: - 
“There is no cavil to the proposition, however, it is to be noted 
that in absence of any plausible explanation, this Court has always 
considered the delay in lodging of FIR to be fatal and castes a 
suspicion on the prosecution story, extending the benefit of doubt to 
the accused. It has been held by this Court that a FIR is always 
treated as a cornerstone of the prosecution case to establish guilt 
against those involved in a crime; thus, it has a significant role to 
play. If there is any delay in lodging of a FIR and commencement 
of investigation, it gives rise to a doubt, which, of course, cannot be 
extended to anyone else except to the accused…” 
 
 
By now it is well settled that First Information Report lays foundation of the 
criminal case and when it has not been promptly recorded and no reasonable 
explanation regarding its delayed recording has come on the record, then it is 
fatal for the case of prosecution; in this regard, guidance has been sought from 
the case of “MUHAMMAD RAFIQUE alias FEEQA versus The STATE” 
(2019 SCMR 1068), MUHAMMAD ADNAN and another versus The STATE 
and others” (2021 SCMR 16) and “GHULAM MUSTAFA versus The STATE” 
(2021 SCMR 542).  
 
 
Admittedly, prosecution did not produce any eyewitness of the 
occurrence during trial of the case; complainant (PW-7), Muhammad Irfan 
(PW-8) and Shaukat Ali (given-up PW) reached at the spot after the 
occurrence; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of complainant         
(PW-7)  is reproduced: - 
“When we reached at the place of occurrence, all the deceased had been 
died.” 
 
As per own case of the prosecution mentioned in Fard Bayan (فرد بیان/ 
(Ex.PEE) and F.I.R. (Ex.PEE/1), when Muhammad Akram (complainant/        
PW-7), Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) and Shaukat Ali (given-up PW) at about 
03:30 a.m. (night) came into the house of occurrence, they saw that                 
Mst. Gulnaz Bibi (now appellant) was having knife (چھری)  in her hand who 
said that Muhammad Ajmal used to torture her daily, for said grudge, she has 
murdered her husband and children while slaughtering (زبح کر کے) them with 
knife (چھری) and hatchet (کلہاڑی); so, complainant (PW-7), Muhammad Irfan 
(PW-8) and Shaukat Ali (given-up PW) are witnesses of extra-judicial 

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.297/2019. 
5
confession of the appellant; they were neither residents of the house of the 
occurrence nor of said vicinity i.e. Riaz Town, Jauharabad rather complainant 
(PW-7) and Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) were residents of Zaman Colony, 
Jauharabad whereas Shaukat Ali (given-up PW) was resident of Qazi Colony, 
Jauharabad; it is relevant to mention here that as per statement of the 
complainant/PW-7, distance between Zaman Colony and Riaz Town is about 
five/six kilometers; in this regard, relevant portion of his statement is 
reproduced as under: - 
“The distance between Zaman Colony and Riaz Town is about 
five/six kilometers.” 
 
Whereas, according to Muhammad Irfan (eyewitness/PW-8), Zaman Colony 
is at a distance of three and half kilometers from Riaz town; in this regard, 
relevant portion of his statement is mentioned as under: - 
“Zaman Colony is at a distance of three and half kilometers from 
Riaz Town.” 
 
So, both these witnesses produced in this case by the prosecution were chance 
witnesses and thus they were required to explain and establish plausible as 
well as valid reason regarding their stated arrival and presence at the place of 
occurrence. Though as per statement/فرد بیان (Ex.PEE) got recorded by 
Muhammad Akram (complainant/PW-7), their close relative died in Chauha 
(چوہا) and for his Fateha Khawani (فاتحہ خوانی), they had to go along with 
Muhammad Ajmal (now deceased) in the early morning and for this purpose, 
he (complainant) along with Shaukat Ali and Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) came 
to the house of his brother Muhammad Ajmal at about 03:30 a.m.; meaning 
thereby that the sole cause of arrival of witnesses including complainant at 
place of occurrence and seeing appellant holding knife (چھری) in her hand was 
that they had to go in Fateha Khawani (فاتحہ خوانی) of their close relative. 
Though complainant/PW-7 during his cross-examination before the Court stated 
that their relative namely Muhammad Imran was hit by fire shot on 09.07.2018 at 
about Asar Prayer time and he died due to said firearm injury at about 
11:00/12:00 p.m. (night); in this regard, relevant portion of his statement is 
mentioned as  under: - 
“Our relative Muhammad Imran was hit by fire shot on 09.07.2018 at 
about Asar prayer time but he died due to said firearm injury at about 
11.00/12.00 p.m (night)” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      (emphasis added) 
 
yet prosecution neither produced copy of any F.I.R. or Rupt (رپٹ) regarding 
infliction of firearm injuries to Muhammad Imran (aforementioned relative of 

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.297/2019. 
6
the complainant) or copy of his Death Registration Certificate showing date of 
his death, during investigation of the case nor got exhibited the same during 
trial of the case; though it was claim of said witnesses that for going to Fateha 
Khawani (فاتحہ خوانی), they came to the house of occurrence yet for said 
purpose why they came at 03:30 a.m. (night), is the question which raises 
eyebrows; their further claim was that door of house of the occurrence was 
open when they came and entered into the house and relevant portion of 
statement of complainant/PW-7 is reproduced below: - 
“When we reached at the house of Ajmal, the small door of main gate 
was open.” 
 
Similarly, relevant portion of statement of Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) is 
mentioned as under:  
“When we reached at the place of occurrence, the main gate of the house 
was narrowly open.” 
 
It is also a mystery and raises question that why during night at said stated 
time i.e. 03:30 a.m., door of the house was open? Prosecution remained 
unable to offer any valid explanation regarding these claims and said most 
relevant questions remained unanswered on part of prosecution. Therefore, 
above-claimed “cause” regarding arrival of complainant and other witnesses 
at the place of occurrence at odd hours of night could not be proved. So, 
evidence of both aforementioned cited witnesses, who could not explain/ 
establish any valid reason/cause regarding their stated arrival at the stated 
time, at the place of occurrence, is “suspect” evidence and cannot be accepted 
without pinch of salt; guidance in this regard has been sought from the case of 
“Mst. SUGHRA BEGUM and another vs. QAISER PERVEZ and others” 
(2015 SCMR 1142) and relevant portion from paragraph No.14 of said case 
law is hereby reproduced: - 
 
“14. 
 A chance witness, in legal parlance is the one who claims 
that he was present on the crime spot at the fateful time, albeit, his 
presence there was a sheer chance as in the ordinary course of 
business, place of residence and normal course of events, he was not 
supposed to be present on the spot but at a place where he resides, 
carries on business or runs day to day life affairs. It is in this context 
that the testimony of chance witness, ordinarily, is not accepted 
unless justifiable reasons are shown to establish his presence at the 
crime scene at the relevant time. In normal course, the presumption 
under the law would operate about his absence from the crime spot. 
True that in rare cases, the testimony of chance witness may be 
relied upon, provided some convincing explanations appealing to 
prudent mind for his presence on the crime spot are put forth, when 
the occurrence took place otherwise, his testimony would fall within 

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.297/2019. 
7
the category of suspect evidence and cannot be accepted without a 
pinch of salt.” 
 
 
Further guidance on the subject has been sought from the case of                  
“MUHAMMAD ASHRAF alias ACCHU versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR 652), 
“Mst. MIR  and another versus The STATE” (2020 SCMR 1850) and “SARFRAZ 
and another versus The STATE” (2023 SCMR 670).  
  
Muhammad Akram (PW-7) and Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) are real 
brothers of Muhammad Ajmal (one of deceased of the case) and paternal 
uncles of remaining four deceased whereas Shaukat Ali (given-up PW) is 
uncle of complainant but after seeing appellant holding knife (چھری) in her 
hand and further after her stated confession regarding the occurrence before 
them, they did not apprehend her; in this regard, relevant portion of statement 
of complainant/PW-7 is reproduced below: - 
 
“We did not try to apprehend Mst. Gulnaz.” 
 
As per statement of Muhammad Irfan (PW-8), there was blood on the hands, 
knife (چ
ھری) and clothes of Mst. Gulnaz Bibi at that time and she sat down in 
the room; relevant portion of his statement in this regard is mentioned as 
under: - 
“There was blood on the hands, churri and the clothes of Mst. Gulnaz at 
that time. Mst. Gulnaz sat down in her room.” 
 
However, at the time of arrest of appellant by Kazim Hussain S.I. (PW-12), 
her hands, feet and clothes were not blood stained; relevant portion of 
statement of Kazim Hussain S.I. (PW-12) is reproduced below: - 
“Her hands, feet and wearing clothes were not stained with blood at the 
time of her arrest.”  
 
As per prosecution‟s version, Muhammad Akram (complainant/PW-7) while 
leaving Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) and Shaukat Ali (given-up PW) at the spot, 
proceeded to police station; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of 
complainant/PW-7 is mentioned as under: - 
“I left Muhammad Irfan, my brother and Shaukat Ali my uncle at the 
guard of dead bodies and proceeded to the police station.” 
 
Similarly, relevant portion of statement of Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) is 
reproduced below: - 
“Leaving us near the dead bodies, Akram went to the police at 6/6.30 
a.m. We remained sitting in the courtyard of the house till the arrival of 
the police.” 
 
When they (witnesses) were there, then why they let appellant to place knife 
(چھری) near the dead body and go from the place of occurrence to the street 

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.297/2019.

because she was arrested from the street; in this regard, relevant portion of 
statement of Kazim Hussain S.I. (PW-12) is reproduced as under: - 
“I arrested Gulnaz accused in the street near the place of occurrence. 
She was seen by us at a distance of 20/25 feet. She did not try to run 
away.” 
 
If hands, clothes of the appellant and knife (چھری) held by her were stained 
with blood, then why they (witnesses) let her to wash the hands and change the 
clothes? This entire conduct of aforementioned witnesses does not appeal to 
common prudent man rather shows that none of them was present there at the 
stated time and version stated by them is tailored/concocted.  
  
Before discussing extra-judicial confession statedly made by the 
appellant before Muhammad Akram (PW-7), Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) and 
Shoukat Ali (given up witness), it is appropriate to examine the motivating 
factors for making extra judicial confession and in this regard, guidance has 
been sought from the case of “SAJID MUMTAZ and others versus 
BASHARAT and others” (2006 SCMR 231), relevant portions of said case 
law are being reproduced: - 
“19.  It is but a natural curiosity to ask as to why a person of sane 
mind should at all confess. No doubt the phenomenon of confession 
is not altogether unknown but being a human conduct, it had to be 
visualized, appreciated and consequented upon purely in the 
background of a human conduct.  
20.  
Why a person guilty of offence entailing capital punishment 
should at all confess. There could be a few motivating factors like: 
(i) to boast off, (ii) to ventilate the suffocating conscience and (iii) 
to seek help when actually trapped by investigation…………….”  
 
“22.  As observed by the Federal Court, we would reiterate 
especially referring to this part of the country, that extra-judicial 
confessions have almost become a norm when the prosecution 
cannot otherwise succeed. Rather, it may be observed with concern 
as well as with regret that when the Investigating Officer fails to 
properly investigate the case, he resorts to padding and concoctions 
like extra-judicial confessions…………….”  
 
Now when extra judicial confession allegedly made by the appellant in the 
case is examined on the touchstone of aforementioned factors, then it is not 
understandable that what compelled the appellant and why she allegedly 
confessed the crime, particularly before the persons, who being closely related 
to the deceased were expected to cause her more harm than good and they 
immediately became witness against her, this aspect also raises doubt about 
genuineness of this piece of evidence; in this regard, guidance has also been 
sought from the case of “AZEEM KHAN and another versus MUJAHID 

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.297/2019. 
9
KHAN and others” (2016 SCMR 274); relevant portion from the same is being 
reproduced below: - 
 
“This, in our considered opinion, appears to be a concocted story. 
He being the relative of the complainant and also running the 
business in the same market, where the complainant do the same 
business, the appellant Mujahid Khan would have never opted for 
disclosing such a gruesome crime to him, when by then the 
complainant party and the Investigating Agency, both were 
clueless about the crime of murder of the deceased and also about 
the actual culprits. This part of the evidence is nothing but a 
tailored story, which was arranged with, the help of the 
Investigating Agency thus, it is of no legal worth and being 
absolutely unreliable is excluded from consideration.”   
 
 
Furthermore, case of “NASIR JAVAID and another versus The STATE”           
(2016 SCMR 1144) can also be safely referred and relevant portion from Page 
No. 1150 is being reproduced: - 
“Next is the evidence of extra-judicial confessions. Evidence of 
this type because of its being concocted easily is always looked at 
with doubt and suspicion. It could be taken as corroborative of 
the charge if it, in the first instance, rings true and then finds 
support from other evidence of unimpeachable character. If the 
other evidence lacks such attribute, it has to be excluded from 
consideration. Extra-judicial confessions of the appellants when 
examined in this light neither ring true nor agree with truth nor fit 
in with the surrounding circumstances of the case. The 
circumstances disclosed therein that the complainant made their 
lives miserable, implicates them in criminal cases and insulted 
their mother are not supported by the prosecution evidence. 
According to the statement of PW-13, the appellants were driven 
by their immense sense of guilt to make extra-judicial confessions. 
But why should they make extra-judicial confessions before PW-
13, who being closely related to the complainant was expected to 
do them more harm than good”           
                                                                              (emphasis added) 
 
 
Aforementioned state of affairs clearly suggests that said piece of 
evidence is neither believable nor reliable rather same has been just 
introduced after finding no other evidence in the case; even otherwise “extra-
judicial Confession” is the weakest type of evidence and it can only be taken 
into consideration if firstly it rings true and then finds support from other 
strong and tangible evidence of unimpeachable character; in this regard, case 
of “Imran alias Dully and another versus The State and others” (2015 SCMR 155) 
can be safely referred: relevant portion is being reproduced: - 
“ (d)  Needless to remark that extra judicial confession has never been 
considered sufficient for recording conviction on a capital charge unless 
it is strongly corroborated by tangible evidence coming from 
unimpeachable source therefore, in our view, this piece of evidence is 
entirely insufficient to carry conviction on such a charge, more so, when 
it is badly tainted one and appears to be the job of the investigating 
officers who normally indulge in such like police chicanery.”  

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &

According to case of prosecution mentioned in Fard Bayan (فرد بیان/Ex.PEE) 
and F.I.R. (Ex.PEE/1), complainant (PW-7) along with aforementioned 
witnesses (mentioned in the F.I.R.) reached in the house of occurrence, saw 
that Mst. Gulnaz Bibi (now appellant) was having knife (چھری) in her hand 
but glowing/litting of any light at that time is not mentioned in the F.I.R. 
(Ex.PEE/1) and even during investigation, neither any electric light/bulb was 
shown in the site plan (Ex.PHH) of the place of occurrence nor taken into 
possession by the Investigating Officer; in this regard, relevant portion of 
statement of Kazim Hussain S.I. (Investigating Officer/PW-12) is mentioned 
as under: - 
“It is correct that I did not mention the presence of electric lights in my 
site plan Ex.PHH.” 
 
which fact further goes against the prosecution; in this regard, guidance has 
been sought from the case of “HAROON SHAFIQUE versus The STATE and 
others” (2018 SCMR 2118), “MIAN SOHAIL AHMED and others versus The 
STATE and others” (2019 SCMR 956) and “SAFDAR MEHMOOD and others 
versus TANVIR HUSSAIN and others” (2019 SCMR 1978).   
Now coming to the arrest of the appellant because as per complainant‟s 
version mentioned in the F.I.R. (Ex.PEE/1), he (PW-7) along with 
Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) and Shaukat Ali (given-up PW) came and found 
Mst. Gulnaz (now appellant) at the place of occurrence with knife (چھری), he 
(PW-7) left Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) and Shaukat Ali (given-up PW) at the 
place of occurrence and himself went to inform police and then came back 
with police, during this period, Muhammad Irfan and Shaukat Ali (witnesses) 
remained in the house of occurrence; he (PW-8) did not state in his statement 
before the Court that during this period, Mst. Gulnaz Ajmal (now appellant) 
changed her blood stained wearing clothes and then went outside from said 
house to the street. But it is own case of the prosecution that appellant was not 
arrested from the house of occurrence rather when complainant came back 
with police, appellant was found in street and arrested from there. Now 
question does arise that how and when she left the house of occurrence and 
reached in the street after changing her blood stained wearing clothes when 
Muhammad Irfan and Shaukat Ali (witnesses) throughout this period 
remained there. Prosecution is silent on this vital aspect of the case and this 
silence is fatal and vitiates the truthfulness of prosecution version.  

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &

When all aforementioned factors are taken into consideration in 
totality, then ocular account furnished by Muhammad Akram (complainant/ 
PW-7) and Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) regarding their coming into the house of 
occurrence at 03:30 a.m. (night), seeing Mst. Gulnaz Bibi (now appellant) 
carrying knife (چھری) in her hand and confessing the occurrence before them, 
is neither confidence inspiring nor truthful; hence, same cannot be relied and 
is hereby discarded.  
As far as medical evidence is concerned, it is trite law that medical 
evidence is mere supportive/confirmatory type of evidence; it can tell about 
locale, nature, magnitude of injury and kind of weapon used for causing injury 
but it cannot tell about identity of the assailant who caused the injury; therefore, 
same is also of no help to the prosecution in peculiar facts and circumstances of 
the case, in this regard, case of “SAJJAN SOLANGI versus The STATE” 
(2019 SCMR 872) can be safely referred.  
 
Now coming to recovery of knife (چھری), hatchet (کلہاڑی) and blood 
stained clothes of the appellant; as per case of prosecution, appellant got 
recovered blood stained knife (چھری/P-14) and blood stained hatchet (کلہاڑی/           
P-15) lying near dead bodies at the place of occurrence; she also got recovered 
blood stained clothes (P-12, P-13) which she was wearing at the time of 
occurrence. Though prosecution claims that blood stained knife (چھری) and 
blood stained clothes of the appellant were recovered yet in Fard Bayan           
(فرد بیان/Ex.PEE) as well as in the F.I.R. (Ex.PEE/1), it is not mentioned that 
knife (چھری) held by appellant as well as clothes of the appellant were              
“blood stained”; as per statement of Muhammad Irfan (PW-8), hands and 
clothes of the appellant were also blood stained (as reproduced above) 
whereas Kazim Hussain S.I. (PW-12), who arrested the appellant at 07:45 
a.m. on the same day, stated in his statement that her hands, feet and wearing 
clothes were not stained with blood (relevant portion of his statement has been 
also already reproduced), meaning thereby that she washed her hands and also 
changed her clothes but then why she did not wash knife (چھری) and hatchet 
(کلہاڑی)? When Muhammad Irfan (PW-8) and Shaukat Ali (given-up PW) 
were at the place of occurrence, then why they let the appellant to place knife 
(چھری) with dead bodies as well as change her blood stained clothes and to leave 
the house/place of occurrence? Inquest reports (Ex.PB, Ex.PF, Ex.PK, Ex.PO 
and Ex.PS) were prepared at the place of occurrence but availability/presence 
of blood stained knife (چھری) and blood stained hatchet there is not mentioned 

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.297/2019. 
12
in any Inquest Report and Column No.22 as well as Column No.23 of the 
Inquest Reports (mentioned above) are blank; in this regard, relevant portion 
of statement of Kazim Hussain (PW-12) is reproduced below: - 
“It is correct that the columns No.22 & 23 of all inquest reports are 
blank.” 
 
This state of affairs creates reasonable doubt about the recovery of knife 
(چھری) and hatchet (کلہاڑی) and in this regard, guidance has been sought from 
the case of “MST. RUKHSANA BEGUM and others versus SAJJAD and 
others” (2017 SCMR 596), relevant portion whereof is being reproduced: - 
“In column No. 23, no crime empty has been shown present there, 
albeit in the recovery memo and in the site plan, these empties had been 
shown recovered lying very close to both dead bodies. This deliberate 
omission, creates reasonable doubts about the recovery.”  
            (emphasis added) 
 
 
 
Though blood stained earth, blood stained clothes of the deceased 
persons, blood stained knife (چھری), blood stained hatchet and blood stained 
clothes of the appellant were sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore yet any report regarding matching of blood group of blood available at 
knife (چھری), hatchet and clothes of the appellant with blood group of blood 
available on blood stained soil and blood stained clothes of any of the 
deceased has not been produced by the prosecution; so, in this regard, case of 
“MUHAMMAD ASIF versus The STATE” (2017 SCMR 486) can be safely 
referred; relevant portion from said case law is hereby reproduced below: - 
“18.  Before parting with this judgment, we deem it essential to point 
out that, mere sending the crime weapons, blood stained to the 
chemical examiner and serologist would not serve the purpose of the 
prosecution nor it will provide any evidence to inter link different 
articles.  
19.  
We have noticed that the Punjab Police invariably indulge in 
such a practice which is highly improper because unless the blood 
stained earth or cotton and blood stained clothes of the victim are not 
sent with the same for opinion of serologist to the effect that it was 
human blood on the crime weapons and was of the same group which 
was available on the clothes of the victim and the blood stained 
earth/cotton, such inconclusive opinion cannot be used as a piece of 
corroboratory evidence.” 
 
Any report regarding availability of finger prints of the appellant on the 
handle of knife (چھری) as well as handle of hatchet (کلہاڑی) has also not been 
produced.  
So much so Kazim Hussain S.I. (PW-12) admitted that he did not get 
any D.N.A. comparison test of knife (چھری), hatchet, blood stained clothes    

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.297/2019. 
13
of the accused and last worn clothes of deceased persons as well as blood 
stained soil, etc.; in this regard, relevant portion of his statement is reproduced 
as under: - 
“It is correct that I did not get DNA comparison test of recovered 
churri, hatchet, bloodstained clothes of the accused Gulnaz, and last 
worn clothes of the deceased persons as well as blood stained soil etc.” 
 
  
In view of afore-mentioned discussed factors, recovery (mentioned 
above) is of no evidentiary value. Furthermore, aforementioned articles were 
secured through recovery memo (Ex.PFF) and Ex.PGG), attested by 
Muhammad Akram (PW-7) and Shaukat Ali (given-up PW). Though recovery 
is a corroborative piece of evidence and it has to corroborate the ocular 
account yet it is trite law that recovery witness cannot corroborate himself and 
corroboration must come from independent source i.e. evidence of other 
witness; in this regard case of “Mst. ZAHIDA SALEEM versus MUHAMMAD 
NASEEM and others” (PLD 2006 Supreme Court 427), “Mst. SUGHRA 
BEGUM and another Vs. QAISER PERVEZ and others.” (2015 SCMR 
1142) and “Mst. RUKHSANA BEGUM and others Vs SAJJAD and others.” 
(2017 SCMR 596), can be referred; relevant portion from “Mst. ZAHIDA 
SALEEM’s case (supra) is reproduced as under: - 
“In the present case the prosecution had produced P.W.6 and P.W.7 
to prove the motive, ocular account and recovery. In the instant case 
the eye-witnesses and the recovery witnesses being the same, as 
mentioned above, the question of corroboration would be a mere 
farce. Whenever any corroboration is required, it emplies that it 
should be an independent one. If the corroboration is also through 
the same witness whose statement is required to be corroborated it 
will be no corroboration in the eye of law in these circumstances, we 
are of the opinion that both the Court below were justified to ignore 
the recoveries.    
 
 
This is not a case wherein one accused by making indiscriminate firing 
with the help of sophisticated firearm/automatic weapon killed more than one 
person rather slaughtering five (5) persons by a single female accused with 
knife (چھری)/hatchet (کلہاڑی) is alleged in this case which aspect itself 
necessitates close scrutiny of the facts/circumstances as well as available 
material. Perusal of report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
bearing Sr. No.0000650042 (available at Page No.38 of the Paperbook) shows 
that four (4) specimens i.e. item No.1 to 4 comprising of suspected fluid, flour 
and food taken from pots (utensils) available at the place of occurrence were 
sent to laboratory; Dethyltoluamide[sic] was detected in item No.01 and item 

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.297/2019. 
14
No.04 whereas Drugs/poisons were not detected in specimens in item No.02 
and item No.03; relevant portion of the report is scanned below: - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is relevant to mention here that Dethyltoluamide mentioned in 
aforementioned report is actually “Diethyltoluamide”, which is N, N Diethyl-
meta-toluamide, also called as “DEET” and oldest/most effective as well as 
common active ingredient in commercial insect repellants having chemical 
formula as C12 H17 NO. As per aforementioned report, it was found in the 
suspected fluid taken from cup of tea and in the suspected food taken from 
plates and cooking pan but its toxic effects were not mentioned in the report.  
 
 
As per report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Ex.PMM, 
available at Page No.44 of the paperbook), specimens of stomachs with 
contents  of all the five deceased were received by said laboratory as item 
No.01 to 05, however, Drugs/poisons were not detected in said stomach 
contents; relevant portion of said report is hereby scanned below: - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dr. Fozia Ameer (PW-1), who conducted postmortem examination over dead 
bodies of Ayesha (deceased) and Aasma (deceased) stated before the Court as 
under:- 
“There is nothing significant in the reports received from PFSA 
(Punjab Forensic Science Agency).”  
  
 
“It is correct that according to PFSA reports no poison etc. was found 
in samples sent to Forensic/Chemical analysis.”    
 

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.297/2019. 
15
Similarly, Dr. Zia-ur Rehman (PW-2) who conducted post-mortem 
examination of dead bodies of Muhammad Ajmal, Muhammad Abdullah and 
Muhammad Fahad stated before the Court as under: - 
“There is nothing significant in the reports received from PFSA 
(Punjab Forensic Science Agency).”  
 
“It is correct that no poison etc. was detected in samples sent to PFSA, 
Lahore for Forensic/Chemical analysis. There was no sign of injury 
caused by resistance of deceased was noted by me during my 
examination.” 
 
In the above circumstances, slaughtering five (5) persons by a single woman is 
also a question mark. 
As far as motive is concerned, as per claim of the complainant 
mentioned in the statement/فرد بیان (Ex.PEE), Muhammad Ajmal (husband of 
the appellant) used to torture her daily and due to this grudge, she has 
committed murder of her husband and children with knife (چھری) and hatchet; 
however, any document or independent witness was not produced by the 
prosecution during investigation or trial of the case to prove/establish that 
there was any dispute or quarrel between the spouses prior to the occurrence 
even complainant/PW-7 during his cross-examination has categorically 
admitted that any quarrel never took place between Gulnaz Bibi (appellant) 
and her husband Muhammad Ajmal (one of the deceased) prior to the 
occurrence; in this regard, relevant portion of his statement is reproduced as 
under: - 
“Never any quarrel took place between Gulnaz bibi and Muhammad 
Ajmal deceased prior to the occurrence.”  
 
Even any reason/justification whatsoever for commission of murder of four 
minor children of the deceased by their mother i.e. appellant has not come on 
the record. Furthermore, aforementioned motive has also not been believed by 
the trial court. So, motive could not be proved by the prosecution.  
 
8. 
It is well established principle of law that single dent/circumstance in 
case of prosecution is sufficient for acquittal; in this regard, case of “ABDUL 
GHAFOOR versus The STATE” (2022 S C M R 1527) can be safely referred.  
 
9. 
Nutshell of the above discussion is that prosecution has been totally/ 
completely failed to prove its case against the appellant; though occurrence 
took place in the house of appellant yet mere for the said reason, she cannot 
be held guilty and in this regard, case of “NASRULLAH alias NASRO versus 
The STATE” (2017 S C M R 724), “ASAD KHAN versus The STATE” (PLD 
2017 Supreme Court 681) and “MUHAMMAD PERVAIZ versus THE 

Criminal Appeal No.72371-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.297/2019. 
16
STATE and other” (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 592) can be safely referred 
and relevant portion from latter case law is reproduced as under: - 
“Homicidal death is not in dispute; appellant‟s plea that dacoits 
intruded the household and strangulate the deceased has not found 
favour with the Courts below. The appellant has also not denied his 
presence, however these factors by themselves cannot hypothesize 
presumption of appellant‟s guilt in the absence of positive proof. 
Silence or implausible explanation cannot equate with failure within the 
contemplation of Article 121 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, thus 
does not absolve the prosecution to drive home the charge by itself on 
the strength of positive proof. It would be grievously unsafe to convict 
suspects on presumptions or upon failure to establish their innocence. 
Possibilities are infinite and do not necessarily include the guilt alone.” 
 
10. 
In view of, what has been discussed above, Criminal Appeal              
No.72371-J/2019, filed by Mst. Gulnaz Ajmal (appellant), is allowed; conviction 
recorded and sentence awarded to the appellant through impugned judgment 
dated: 17.09.2019 is hereby set aside.  Appellant is acquitted of the charge, she 
shall be released from the jail forthwith, if not required in any other case. 
11. 
Resultantly, death sentence awarded to Mst. Gulnaz (appellant) is NOT 
CONFIRMED and Murder Reference (M. R. No.297 of 2019) is answered in 
NEGATIVE. 
12.   It goes without saying that if blood group of the deceased is mentioned 
in the post-mortem examination report, it would be helpful for ascertaining 
blood group of the blood available on (i) blood stained soil/earth or cotton 
secured from the place of occurrence, (ii) blood stained clothes of the 
deceased and (iii) blood stained weapon/article recovered in the case as well 
as for D.N.A. test. Therefore, Registrar of this Court will send a copy of this 
judgment to Secretary Health, Govt. of the Punjab, Inspector General of 
Police, Punjab, Prosecutor General, Punjab and Director General of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for doing needful in this regard.
