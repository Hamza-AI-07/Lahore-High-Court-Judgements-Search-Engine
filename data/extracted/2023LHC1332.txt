APPELLANTS BY: 
M/s Imtiaz Rashid Siddiqui, Shahryar Kasuri, 
Raza Imtiaz Siddiqui and Muhammad Hamza, 
Advocates. 
RESPONDENTS BY: 
M/s Ahmad Pervaiz, Saffi ul Hassan Advocates. 
Mr. Asad Ali Bajwa, Deputy Attorney General 
for Pakistan. 
 
Shahid Karim, J:-. This is an appeal under Section 3 of 
the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 and brings a 
challenge to the order dated 20.12.2022 passed in W.P 
No.80856 of 2022 by a learned Single Judge of this 
Court (“the impugned order”).  
2. 
The relief claimed in the constitutional petition was for 
seeking a declaration regarding SRO No.563(I)/2022 dated 
29.04.2022 (SRO 563) to be struck down as having been 
issued without lawful authority.  Further reliefs were claimed 
on the basis of the former SRO No.363(I)/2012 dated 
13.04.2012 (SRO 363) under which the appellant claimed the 
benefit of refund for the months of July 2021, September 
2021, November 2021, December 2021 and February 2022 
which accumulates to PKR 3,806,855,796/- (the refund 
amount claim).  The appellant before the learned Single 
Judge sought to restrain any action to be taken either by the 
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) or any of its officials under 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
2 
 
 
SRO 563 as also the proceedings before respondent No.8 in 
respect of the show cause notice issued on 31.5.2022 was 
sought to be quashed. 
3. 
The historical facts would lend actuality to the 
analysis.  There is no quarrel that SRO 363 was issued by 
FBR which enacted the rules called „Refund Claims of 
Recognized Agricultural Tractor Manufacturers Rules, 2012‟ 
(Rules, 2012) which prescribe a procedure for filing of refund 
application to the Commissioner Inland Revenue.  Rules 2, 3 
and 4 have relevance to the issue at hand and are set out 
below: 
2. 
Filing of refund application.- The refund claimant 
shall file a refund application to the Commissioner, Inland 
Revenue having jurisdiction, along with the following 
documents, namely:- 
 
(a) 
a copy of tax paid and e-filed sales tax 
return: 
 
(b) 
an undertaking affirming the genuineness of 
refund as per Sales Tax Act, 1990  
 
 
and 
relevant rules made thereunder: and  
            (c) 
a revolving bank guarantee valid for at least 
ninety days issued by a scheduled bank, to 
the satisfaction of the Commissioner, Inland 
Revenue having jurisdiction, of an amount 
not less than the average monthly refund 
claim during last twelve months.  
3. 
Refund of Input tax.- The refund of admissible 
excess input tax shall be allowed on the basis of above 
documents within three days of receipt thereof.  
4. 
Filing of complete, refund claim.- Within fifteen 
days of the sanctioning of refund, the claimant shall file a 
complete refund claim along with the requisite supportive 
documents prescribed in rule 38 of the Sales Tax Rules, 
2006, except the statement prescribed in clause (e) of sub-
rule (1) of the said rule which shall be submitted 
biannually. A soft copy of the claim on the prescribed 
format shall also be submitted which shall be scrutinized 
under the Sales Tax Act, 1990 and the rules made 
thereunder and the objections, if any, related to the refund 
claim shall be conveyed to the claimant within thirty days 
of the receipt of claim.” 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
3 
 
 
4. 
According to rule 3 the refund of admissible excess 
input tax shall be allowed on the basis of documents 
mentioned in rule 2 within three days of receipt thereof.  It is 
not the case of the Sales Tax Department that the appellant‟s 
application was deficient in any manner and according to rule 
3 set out above the refund of admissible excess input tax 
would be deemed to have been sanctioned within three days 
of the receipt.  Clearly this was not done and the Department 
kept dillydallying on one pretext or the other.  Prior to this it 
is the case of the appellant that the Department has always 
reneged on the terms of SRO 363 and did not sanction the 
refund of input tax within the time stipulated in rule 3.  The 
appellant was, therefore, constrained to approach the Federal 
Tax Ombudsman (FTO) which by its order dated 21.09.2021 
made the following recommendations: 
“Recommendations: 
8. 
FBR to direct the Chief Commissioner-IR, LTO, 
Lahore to-  
(i). 
Process and settle the due refund to the 
Complaint as contained in the Refund Claims of 
Recognized Agricultural Tractors Manufacturers 
Rules, 2012 notified vide SRO 363(I)2012 dated 
13.04.2012, as per law; 
(ii) 
For 
future 
application, 
FBR 
may 
recommend to the Government to define the term 
“Agricultural Tractors” in column 5 of Table-1 of 
Eighth Schedule to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, against 
S. No.25, in case it intends to restrict the exemption 
beyond 5 percent to some other use of tractors 
(agriculture purpose); and  
(iii). Report compliance within 45 days.” 
5. 
A representation to the President was also dismissed.  
Hence, FTO directed the Chief Commissioner LTO Lahore to 
process and settle the due refund of the appellant in terms of 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
4 
 
 
the Rules, 2012.  It was further recommended for future 
applications, FBR may recommend to the Government to 
define the term “Agricultural Tractors” in the Sales Tax Act, 
1990 in case it intended to restrict the exemption beyond 5 
percent to some other use of tractors.  Pursuant to the 
recommendations some of the refunds were disbursed to the 
appellant and therefore to that extent the refund claims stood 
satisfied.  However, the refund amount claim remained 
outstanding and for which the appellant kept requesting FBR 
and its relevant officials to approve the claim of the appellant 
but to no avail.  This according to the appellant‟s counsel, 
showed an unmistakable partisan slant on the part of FBR.   
6. 
On 29.04.2022, SRO 563 was issued by FBR and a 
new Chapter was inserted in the Sales Tax Rules, 2006 
namely „Chapter V-C‟ relating to refund to Agricultural 
Tractor Manufacturers.  Rule 39O is engaged in this opinion 
and states that: 
“39O. Application.—(1) This Chapter shall apply to 
existing and future refund claims as filed by the 
registered agricultural tractor manufacturers engaged in 
supply of agricultural tractors. 
(2) 
The provisions of these rules shall apply only if the 
incidence of tax sought to be refunded has not been 
passed on to the consumers.” 
7. 
Rule 39P is the definition clause and defines „eligible 
person‟ to be the following: 
“(b) “eligible person” means manufacturer of agricultural 
tractors who supplies tractors to a person holding a valid 
proof of land holding such as agriculture pass book and 
copy of record of rights of agricultural land duly verified 
from Provincial Land Revenue Authorities.” 
8. 
SRO 563 defined agricultural tractor to mean „a 
tractor used by farmers or growers engaged in production 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
5 
 
 
of agricultural produce through tractor’.  It also laid down 
the procedure for filing of refund application.  Further, by 
rule 39Z Rules, 2012 were repealed. 
9. 
The arguments in this Court centred on Rule 39O 
inserted through SRO 563 which made applicable the Chapter 
to existing and future refund claims as filed by the registered 
agricultural tractor manufacturers engaged in supply of 
agricultural tractors.  At first blush, this rule is actuated by 
bad faith and doubtless intended to stall and prevent the 
disbursement of refund claims which were already pending.  
It is a well-worn rule that a mala fide act is an act without 
jurisdiction and is a fraud on the statute.  (See PLD 1965 SC 
671).  As to what is meant by bad faith and its true sense, the 
following statement from Wade & Forsyth‟s Administrative 
Law (Twelfth edition), has this to say: 
“It is extremely rare for public authorities to be found 
guilty of intentional dishonestly; normally they are 
found to have erred, if at all, by ignorance or 
misunderstanding.  Yet the courts constantly accuse 
them of bad faith merely because they have acted 
unreasonably or on improper grounds.  Again and 
again it is laid down that powers must be exercised 
reasonably and in good faith.  But in this context „in 
good faith‟ means merely „for legitimate reasons‟.  
Contrary to the natural sense of the words, they 
impute no moral obliquity.” 
 
And the effect of an act in bad faith and with improper 
motives is explained in De smith‟s Judicial Review (seventh 
edition, p.290) in the following terms: 
“Fundamental to the legitimacy of public decision-
making is the principle that official decisions should 
not be infected with improper motives such as fraud or 
dishonestly, malice or personal self-interest.  These 
motives, which have the effect of distorting or unfairly 
biasing the decision-maker‟s approach to the subject 
of the decision, automatically cause the decision to be 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
6 
 
 
taken for an improper purpose and thus take it outside 
the permissible parameters of the power.” 
10. 
There is no contention that the appellant had filed its 
refund claims prior to the enactment of SRO 563 and in terms 
of SRO 363 and rule 3 in particular the refund of admissible 
input tax would be deemed to have been allowed within three 
days of receipt.  Since the Commissioner Inland Revenue sat 
on the refund claims of the appellant and did not sanction 
them, this was used as a lever by FBR to delay the sanction of 
refund claims and thereafter proceeded to issue a Notification 
to stunt the claim entirely.  SRO 563 sought to apply the 
notification to existing refund claims as well.  As explicated, 
the narration of historical facts above clearly shows that SRO 
563 in its application to existing refund claims is a mala fide 
and unreasonable exercise of power by FBR.  Secondly, FBR 
neither has the power to take away vested rights and to upset 
past transactions nor to apply a notification retrospectively 
under the purported powers conferred by section 50 of the 
Sales Tax Act, 1990.  Section 50 does not confer power upon 
FBR to make retrospective application of an amendment 
made in the Sales Tax Rules, 2006.  Moreover, it does not 
possess the power in any case to upend rights which have 
come to vest in a registered person such as the appellant who 
was entitled to excess input tax and for its refund on the basis 
of SRO 363.  The appellant applied for the refund claims 
timeously and these claims should have been allowed within 
the mandate of SRO 363. 
11. 
Learned counsel for the appellant also referred to a 
letter dated 5.11.2021 issued in compliance of decision made 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
7 
 
 
by this Court in ICA No.53020 of 2021 which was previously 
filed by the appellant.  These proceedings had been brought 
seeking compliance of FTO‟s order dated 21.9.2021.  
Pursuant to the direction of this Court, the following decision 
was issued by FBR (the decision): 
“02. Issue of applicability of payment of refund of 
sales tax to M/s Millat Tractors Limited under Chapter 
V of the Sales Tax Rules, 2006 or procedure 
prescribed for processing of refund claims of 
Recognised Agricultural Tractor Manufacturers vide 
SRO 363(I)/2012 dated 13-4-2012 has been examined. 
03. 
It is intimated that Chapter V of the Sales Tax 
Rules, 2006 deals with payment of refund of sales tax 
for all registered person.  However, the Board has 
prescribed special procedure for processing of refund 
claims 
of 
Recognised 
Agricultural 
Tractor 
Manufacturers vide SRO 363(I)/2012 dated 13-4-
2012. 
04. 
In the light of above, for processing of refund 
claims 
of 
Recognised 
Agricultural 
Tractor 
Manufacturers , SRO 363 (I)/2012 dated 13-4-2012 is 
applicable.” 
12. 
Doubtless, in view of the above statement made by 
FBR, SRO 363 was applicable for processing of refund 
claims of recognized agricultural tractor manufacturers.  This 
works as an estoppel on FBR which cannot now turn around 
and assert otherwise on the basis of SRO 563.  Until SRO 563 
was brought into effect, the refund claims already pending 
with FBR ought to have been sanctioned in terms of SRO 
363.  This was the question before the learned Single Judge 
and which was not adverted to in the impugned order.  
Therefore, to the extent of word “existing” used in rule 39O 
of SRO 563, it is held to be inapplicable to the case of 
appellant.  There is no need to set aside the entire SRO 563 as 
FBR clearly has the power to amend the Rules, 2006 or to 
substitute the existing Chapter with a new Chapter.  However, 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
8 
 
 
that must apply prospectively and not retrospectively.  The 
right had come to inhere in the appellant and became 
crystallized as soon as documents under rule 2 of SRO 363 
had been filed.  The appalling act of delay cannot be 
attributed to the appellant.  It would be a devious machination 
on FBR‟s part to firstly, delay the refund, and thereafter 
stonewalling it on the premise of SRO 563.  We have no 
doubt in our mind that even if the word „existing‟ was 
allowed to stand in SRO 563, it would have no application in 
the case of appellant.  The ancillary argument whether section 
50 of the Act, 1990 contains power of retrospective rule-
making is moot and we leave it to be decided in another case. 
13. 
A reference to definition of the term „eligible person‟ 
would also be apt under the circumstances.  According to the 
definition an eligible person mean a manufacturer of 
agricultural tractors who supplies tractors to a person holding 
a valid proof of land holding such as agricultural pass book 
and copy of record of rights of agricultural land.  
Undoubtedly, this condition could not have been fulfilled 
retrospectively by the appellant who had already made the 
supplies under SRO 363.  The definition of eligible person as 
set out above and mentioned in SRO 563 also lends credence 
to the argument that SRO 563 was designed to apply 
prospectively and not retrospectively.   
14. 
In our jurisprudence the rule is now settled and 
vouched by respectable authority that an enactment which 
prejudicially affects vested rights or the legality of past 
transactions cannot be given retrospective operation.  This 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
9 
 
 
rule is based on the principle of promissory estoppel and 
legitimate expectation and was articulated in Al-Samrez 
Enterprise v. The Federation of Pakistan (1986 SCMR 1917) 
in which while relying upon Maxwell‟s Interpretation of 
Statutes, 1962 Edition, it was held that: 
“The subsequent notification impugned in this case was 
issued in exercise of statutory power and has the force of a 
statutory instrument.  Accordingly the Rules of a statutory 
construction are attracted to the interpretation and 
determination of its legal effect.  It is well-settled that an 
enactment which prejudicially affected vested rights or the 
legality of past transactions, or impairs contracts cannot 
be given retrospective operation.  Thus, Maxwell‟s 
Interpretation of Statutes, 1962 Edition at page 206 
observed: 
“Every statute, it has been said, which takes 
away or impairs vested rights acquired under 
existing laws, or creates a new obligation, or 
imposes a new duty, or attaches a new 
disability 
in respect of transactions 
or 
considerations already past, must be presumed, 
out of respect to the legislature, to be intended 
not to have a retrospective operation.” 
The principle of law enunciated above has been recognised 
in Corpus Juris of this country and also statutorily in 
section 6 of the General Clauses Act.  For instances of the 
application of this rule of interpretation reference may be 
made to In re : March Mander v. Harris (1884) 27 Ch. D. 
166 and Jones v. Ogle (1872) L.R. 8 Ch. A. 192.  We are, 
therefore, clearly of the opinion that if a binding contract 
was concluded between the appellants and the foreign 
exporter or steps were taken by the appellants creating a 
vested right to the then existing notification granting 
exemption, the same could not be taken away and 
destroyed in modification of the earlier one, one the 
ground that under section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 
the Government could exercise the power of modification.  
The question before us is not whether the second 
notification was ultra vires the powers of the Government 
but whether the second notification would be applicable 
to the case of the appellants resulting in taking away the 
exemption already granted.” 
 
15. 
This rule was affirmed in Molasses Trading & Export 
(Pvt.) Limited v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PTCL 
1994 CL 222) although the question was regarding the 
precise scope of Sectin 31A of the Customs Act, 1969 which 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
10 
 
 
had been brought in by the legislature to stunt the effect of Al-
Samrez.  This rule was once again reiterated in M/s. M.Y. 
Electronics Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. through Manager and 
others v. Government of Pakistan, through Secretary 
Finance, Islamabad and others (PTCL 1998 CL 450) after 
the extensive reference to the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
and its origins.  The observations were to the following effect: 
“…The observations of this Court in Azizuddin Industries 
Limited‟s case that the vested right under the exemption 
notification could not be taken away by an executive action 
are therefore, applicable only to a case where the 
Government first granted exemption for a specified period 
and then attempt to withdraw the same thus defeating the 
vested right through an executive action.  However, even 
vested right under an exemption notification which is a 
time-bound, could be taken away by a legislature measure 
as held by this Court in Army Welfare Sugar Mills Ltd.‟ 
case…” 
16. 
The question came up for discussion in M/s Army 
Welfare Sugar Mills Ltd. and others v. Federation of Pakistan 
and others (PTCL 1993 CL 188) and the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan once again delved into the doctrine of promissory 
estoppel and went on to hold that a representation through a 
statutory regulatory order (SRO) could only be withdrawn by 
a legislative act.  In M/s Army Welfare Sugar Mills too the 
benefit granted by a notification was sought to be withdrawn 
by a subsequent notification and it was concluded that the 
earlier notification contained a representation which could 
have been rescinded before it was acted upon or if it was 
acted upon, its effect could have been nullified by statutory 
provision and not by an executive act.  This means that vested 
rights could not be impaired either by an executive act or by 
the exercise of powers delegated by the legislature unless the 
legislature has specifically granted delegation to enact 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
11 
 
 
retrospective measures.  Recently, the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan was confronted with a similar issue in Muhammad 
Rafique and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others 
(PTCL 2015 CL 219) and the following answer was returned 
with regard to the principle laid down in Al-Samrez: 
“15. 
That we are afraid that we cannot agree with Mr. 
Kashif Nazeer‟s contention that the principle laid down in 
Al-Samrez is no longer applicable after the insertion of 
section 31A of Customs Act, 1969.  Section 31A is limited 
in application, as it itself states, to “the rate of duty 
applicable to any goods” which “shall include amount of 
duty imposed under Sections 18, 18A and 18C and the duty 
that may have become payable in consequence of the 
withdrawal of the whole or any part of the exemption or 
concession from duty whether before or after the 
conclusion of a contract or agreement for the sale of such 
goods or opening of a letter of credit in respect thereof.”  
The said section does not refer to income tax or advance 
income tax therefore it can not be made applicable to the 
same.  Therefore, whilst the application of Al-Samrez with 
regard to customs duty has been undone, but the legal 
principle enunciated in Al-Samrez will continue to have 
effect with regard to advance income tax, with which we 
are concerned.” 
17. 
It is clear from the case law referred above that the rule 
has respectable origins and has not undertaken any change.  
In the present case rights had come to vest in the appellant 
which could not have been impaired or taken away by FBR 
while substituting the rules and while exercising rule-making 
power delegated upon it by the legislature.  In the guise of 
making rules, vested and concluded rights could not have 
been taken away by the enactment of a notification which was 
to take effect retrospectively.  This could only have been done 
by the legislature under its primary power to legislate. 
18. 
Learned counsel for the respondent-department raised 
a threshold objection regarding maintainability of this appeal.  
Suffice to say that the challenge before the learned Single 
Judge was to SRO 563 through which rules were enacted and 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
12 
 
 
a Chapter was added to the existing Rules, 2006.  This power 
to undo the rules or to hold them unlawful did not vest in the 
adjudicating authority under the law.  Although in a previous 
constitution petition W.P No.39228 of 2022, a direction was 
indeed issued to consider the question regarding legality of 
SRO 563, that question in our opinion could not have been 
considered by the Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue 
while passing the impugned order on 21.11.2022.  In any case 
the Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue did advert to this 
aspect in the impugned order dated 21.11.2022 for obvious 
reasons.  In the final analysis it was concluded that: 
“Therefore, the rules issued vide SRO 563(I)/2022 has 
legal validity under the Sales Tax Act, 1990.” 
19. 
There is no discussion on the grounds taken by the 
appellant 
regarding 
retrospectivity. 
 
The 
Deputy 
Commissioner misdirected himself in assuming that SRO 563 
applied to the appellant‟s claims and so proceeded to upend 
valid claims.  A challenge to SRO 563 was a recurring cause 
of action and the appellant was constrained to approach this 
Court once again not only to challenge SRO 563 but also to 
challenge the proceedings before Deputy Commissioner 
Inland Revenue and the failure on the part of Deputy 
Commissioner to consider and adjudicate the question 
regarding 
competence 
of 
FBR 
to 
issue 
SRO 
563 
retrospectively.  The entire proceedings in the show cause 
notice dated 31.5.2022 as well as the ensuing order dated 
21.11.2022 have also been brought under challenge.  This 
could have been done by direct recourse to this Court by 
making a collateral challenge which view finds support from 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
13 
 
 
the holding of Supreme Court of Pakistan in Pakistan 
International Airlines Corporation through Chairman and 
others v. Samina Masood and others (PLD 2005 Supreme 
Court 831): 
“…We are, therefore, of the considered view that when a 
civil servant challenges the vires of law or rule being ultra 
vires the Constitution without the same having been 
violated by the departmental authority, the remedy lies 
before the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution 
and not before the Service Tribunal.” 
20. 
By the impugned order dated 21.11.2022 the Deputy 
Commissioner Inland Revenue has held the appellant 
disentitled to the refund claim in respect of the period 
mentioned above.  Since we have held that SRO 563 does not 
apply retrospectively and have struck down the word 
„existing‟ in rule 39O of SRO 563, the show cause notice 
dated 31.5.2022 as well as the order passed by the Deputy 
Commissioner Inland Revenue dated 21.11.2022 are also held 
to have been passed without lawful authority and of no legal 
effect.  We cannot permit the appellant to go through the 
rigors of long drawn litigation process for the refund claim to 
be made over to the appellant.  The entire exercise in the 
issuance of SRO 563 and for it to apply retrospectively was a 
mala fide act on the part of FBR and clearly meant to deprive 
the appellant of its due refund claim.  Therefore, we do not 
deem it appropriate to refuse to adjudicate and decide the 
instant appeal on the misplaced notion that the appellant must 
go through the appellate procedures provided under the law to 
answer the allegations made in the show cause notice which 
has no basis in law and is illegal. 

ICA No.83099 of 2022 
14 
 
 
21. 
In view of the above, the impugned order is set aside.  
It is held that: 
i. 
SRO 563 does not apply to the refund claims of the 
appellant which must be processed and disbursed 
expeditiously under SRO 363. 
ii. 
The impugned show-cause notice dated 31.05.2022 as 
well as the impugned order dated 21.11.2022 passed 
by the Deputy Commissioner are held to be null and of 
no effect. 
Appeal allowed.
