JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing:  
       09.01.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Raja 
Habib 
ur 
Rehman, 
Advocate. 
Respondent No.1 by: 
Barrister Taimoor Aslam Khan. 
Respondents No.2 to 5 by: Ex-parte. 
 
 
MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. The petitioner namely Colonel 
Retired Muhammad Shabir Awan contested bye-election held on 17th 
July, 2022 for the Punjab Provisional Assembly Seat PP-VII 
Rawalpindi-II alongwith respondents No.1 to 5 and on the completion 
of voting process, respondent No.1 (hereinafter referred to as 
“respondent”) was declared as returned candidate, who secured 68918 
votes as compared to 68863 votes of the petitioner. Through instant 
petition under section 139 of the Elections Act, 2017 (hereinafter 
referred to as “Act, 2017”) the petitioner calls in question the 
candidature of “respondent” on various grounds enumerated in the 
petition.  
2. 
In response to this petition, the “respondent” submitted his reply 
wherein he raised certain objections on maintainability of instant 

Election Petition No.01 of 2022 
 
~2~ 
 
petition, including an objection to the effect that the petitioner failed to 
adhere the requirements as contemplated under sections 144(4) and 145 
of the “Act, 2017” read with order VI rule 15 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred to as “C.P.C.”).  
3. 
Treating the above objections as legal, going to the root of the 
case both the counsel were heard at length. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the “respondent” Barrister Taimoor Aslam 
Khan contended that in terms of sub-section (4) of section 144 and 
section 145 of the “Act, 2017” the petitioner was obliged to get his 
petition verified in the manner laid down in the “C.P.C.” for 
verification of the pleadings. While drawing attention of this Court to 
the petition, learned counsel emphasized that it is not verified as 
required under the law. Learned counsel added that petition was got 
verified from Notari Public who was not the Oath Commissioner and as 
such petition merits rejection. In order to support his contentions, 
learned counsel placed reliance on MUSHTAQ AHMED versus Sardar 
AFTAB AKBAR KHAN and others (2019 MLD 1313). 
5. 
Conversely, Raja Habib ur Rehman, Advocate learned counsel 
representing the petitioner submitted that there is no denial that the 
petition shall be verified in the manner provided under “C.P.C.” but 
due compliance was made as it was got verified from Notary Public. 
Learned counsel contended with vehemence that verification/attestation 
from Notary Public is sufficient compliance of Section 144(4) of the 
“Act, 2017” and the objection is highly misconceived. In support of his 
contentions learned counsel has placed reliance on Rai HASSAN NAWAZ 
versus Haji MUHAMMAD AYUB and others (PLD 2017 Supreme Court 70). 
6. 
After having heard learned counsel for the parties at considerable 
length, I have perused the record with their able assistance. 
7. 
In order to amend, consolidate and unify laws relating to the 
conduct of elections and matters connected therewith or ancillary 
thereto, the “Act, 2017” was promulgated by the Majlis-e- Shoora 
(Parliament) with the assent of the President of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan on 2nd October, 2017. Chapter IX lays down a procedure for 

Election Petition No.01 of 2022 
 
~3~ 
 
the settlement of election disputes. In terms of section 139 of the “Act, 
2017” no election shall be called in question except by an election 
petition filed by a candidate for that election. For the trial of election 
petitions under the “Act, 2017”, the Election Commission of Pakistan 
constituted under Article 218 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, appointed as many Election Tribunals as 
may be necessary for swift disposal of election petitions. Needless to 
observe that this petition is before this Tribunal in pursuance thereof. 
Election petition is to be presented in a manner provided under section 
142 of the “Act, 2017” and Section 144 lays down necessary pre-
conditions for the election petition. Sub-section (4) of section 144 of 
the Act ibid ordains that an election petition and its annexures shall be 
signed by the petitioner and the petition shall be verified in the manner 
laid down in the “C.P.C.” for the verification of pleadings. Section 145 
of the “Act, 2017” prescribes a procedure before the Election Tribunal. 
Sub-section (1) of section 145 of the “Act, 2017” contemplates that if 
any provision of sections 142, 143 or 144 has not been complied with, 
the Election Tribunal shall summarily reject the election petition. It 
would not be out of context to mention here that the Tribunal when 
once reaches at the conclusion that petition is not proceedable it cannot 
wait till the culmination of the proceedings through regular trial. The 
mandate of law is to nip the evil in the bud. The “C.P.C.” also bestows 
power upon the Civil Court to reject the plaint summarily in terms of 
Order VII Rule 11, if it suffers with the flaws mentioned in the said 
provision. The Tribunal, thus, can proceed on the same paramateria and 
to reject the election petition at any stage. The Tribunal is even vested 
with the power to adopt any other procedure for the expeditious 
disposal depending upon the circumstances of the case. The provisions 
of the “Act, 2017” are unequivocal and clear to this extent that a 
petitioner while presenting the election petition, is obliged to adhere the 
mandate of sections 142, 143 and 144 of the “Act, 2017”. Non-
compliance of any of the said provisions renders automatic rejection of 
the election petition. Reliance in in this respect can be placed on Lt. Col. 
(Rtd.) GHAZANFAR ABBAS SHAH versus Mehr KHALID MEHMOOD SARGANA 

Election Petition No.01 of 2022 
 
~4~ 
 
and others (2015 SCMR 1585) and Engr. IQBAL ZAFAR JHARGA and others 
versus KHALILUR REHMAN and 4 others (2000 SCMR 250).  
8. 
As already observed that sub-section (4) of section 144 of the 
“Act, 2017” prescribes that the election petition and its annexures shall 
be signed by the petitioner and it shall be verified in the manner laid 
down in the “C.P.C.” for the verification of pleadings. The manner of 
verification of the pleadings is laid down in Order VI Rule 15 of 
“C.P.C.” in the following way :- 
“15. Verification of pleadings.---(1) Save as otherwise provided by 
any law for the time being in force, every pleading shall be verified 
on oath or solemn affirmation at the foot by the party or by one of 
the parties pleading or by some other person proved to the 
satisfaction of the Court to be acquainted with the facts of the case. 
(2) The person verifying shall specify, by reference to the numbered 
paragraphs of the pleading, what he verifies of his own knowledge 
and what he verifies upon information received and believed to be 
true. 
(3) The verification shall be signed by the person making it and shall 
state the date on which and the place at which it was signed.” 
The above provision of law shall be read with section 139 of the 
“C.P.C.” which is reproduced below for ready reference and 
convenience :- 
“139. Oath on affidavit by whom to be administered.--In the case of 
any affidavit under this Code-- 
(a) 
any Court or Magistrate, or 
(b) 
any officer or other person whom a High Court may appoint 
in this behalf, or 
(c) 
any officer appointed by any other Court which the 
Provincial Government has generally or specially empowered 
in this behalf, may administer the oath to the deponent.” 
The joint reading of both the above provisions clearly shows that the 
pleadings shall be verified on oath and said oath to be administered by 
a person who is duly authorized in this behalf.  
9. 
The pivotal and frizzy question thus arises for the determination 
of this Court is as to {whether “Oath Commissioner” and “Notary 
Public” is the same thing for the purposes of Section 144 of the 
“Act, 2017”}.  
10. 
A Notary is to be appointed under the Notaries Ordinance (XIX 
of 1961) (hereinafter referred to as “Ordinance, 1961”). Power to 
appoint Notary vests in the Provincial Government. Functions of the 

Election Petition No.01 of 2022 
 
~5~ 
 
Notary are laid down in section 8 of the “Ordinance, 1961” which read 
as under :- 
“8. Functions of notaries.--(1) A notary may do all or any of the 
following acts by virtue of his office, namely:-- 
(a) verify, authenticate, certify or attest the execution of any 
instrument; 
(b) present any promissory note, hundi or bill of exchange for 
acceptance or payment or demand better security; 
(c)  note or protest the dishonour by non-acceptance or non-payment 
of any promissory note, hundi or bill of exchange or protest for 
better security or prepare acts of honour under the Negotiable 
Instruments Act, 1881 (XXVI of 1881), or serve notice of such 
note or protest; 
(d)  note and draw up ship’s protest, boat’s protest or protest relating 
to demurrage and other commercial matters;  
(e)  administer oath to, or take affidavit from, any person; 
(f)  prepare bottomry and respondantia bonds, charter parties and 
other mercantile documents; 
(g)  prepare, attest or authenticate any instrument intended to take 
effect in any country or place outside Pakistan in such form and 
language as may conform to the law of the place where such 
deed is intended to operate; 
(h)  translate, and verify the translation of, any document from one 
language into another; 
(i)  any other act which may be prescribed. 
(2) No act specified in sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be a 
notarial act except when it is done by a notary under his signature 
and official seal.” 
In exercise of the powers conferred by section 15 of the “Ordinance, 
1961” the West Pakistan Notaries Rules, 1965 (hereinafter referred to 
as “Rules, 1965”) were framed. 
11. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner while reading sub-rule (8) of 
rule 12 of the Rules ibid submitted that a Notary in addition to the 
functions specified in clauses (a) to (h) of sub-section (1) of section 8 
can attest or certify document. In furtherance thereof, he relied upon Rai 
HASSAN NAWAZ versus Haji MUHAMMAD AYUB and others (PLD 2017 
Supreme Court 70) and submitted that in the light thereof there is no 
distinction between Notary Public and Oath Commissioner, suffice to 
observe that in the case of Rai Hassan Nawaz supra the person, who 
verified the election petition and annexures appended thereto at the 
time of its filing, was actually neither holding any valid license of 
Notary Public nor Oath Commissioner and in this backdrop a passing 
reference was given to both the terms in Para No.9 of the judgment. It 
is nowhere held by the Hon’ble Apex Court that Notary and Oath 
Commissioner are the same and synonymous terms/offices.  

Election Petition No.01 of 2022 
 
~6~ 
 
12. 
Contrary to this an Oath Commissioner is to be appointed by the 
High Court under section 139(b) of “C.P.C.” and section 539 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. The prime object of appointing 
Oath Commissioner is to attest affidavits to be produced before a court 
to prove any particular fact or facts. Rules and Orders of the Lahore 
High Court, Lahore Volume IV Chapter 12 prescribes the forms of 
oaths and affirmations to be administered to witnesses, who may be 
required for evidence before any court or interpreter and juror. Part B 
of the said chapter deals with the affidavits wherein the manner of 
appointment and charging of fee by the Oath Commissioner is provided 
alongwith mode of administering of oath as well as attesting, signing 
and verification of affidavits whereas Volume V Chapter 1 Part E of 
the Rules and Orders of the Lahore High Court, Lahore lays down the 
procedure for making and filing of affidavits in the High Court. In short 
when sub-section (4) of Section 144 of the “Act, 2017” mandates that 
an election petition and its annexures shall be signed by the petitioner 
and affidavit shall be verified in the manner laid down in the “C.P.C.” 
for the verification of pleadings, so one would have no other option 
except to proceed strictly in terms thereof.  
13. 
As already observed that while reading jointly order VI rule 15 
and section 139 of “C.P.C.” no other inference can be drawn except 
that pleadings shall be verified on oath and said oath to be administered 
by a person who is duly authorized in this behalf. In terms of section 
139(b) of “C.P.C.” such an officer or person can only be whom the 
High Court may appoint in this behalf, which in no way can be Notary. 
An “Oath Commissioner” and “Notary” are both different and distinct 
terms/offices. The intermingling of both would result into serious legal 
complications. It is trite law that when a procedure is prescribed by law 
for the performance of an act that should be done in that way but in no 
other way, which command of law is always deemed to be mandatory. 
Reference to this effect can be made to ATTAULLAH KHAN versus ALI 
AZAM AFRIDI and others (2021 SCMR 1979) and MUHAMMAD ANWAR and 
others versus Mst. ILYAS BEGUM and others (PLD 2013 Supreme Court 255). 

Election Petition No.01 of 2022 
 
~7~ 
 
14. 
The crux of above discussion is that the petitioner has failed to 
abide the necessary requirements of section 144(2) of the “Act, 2017”. 
Resultantly this petition fails and rejected with no order as to costs.
