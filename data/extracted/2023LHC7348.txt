Precisely, the necessary facts of the prosecution case, as stated by 
Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3), the complainant of the case, are as under:- 
 “ On 01.07.2019 1 alongwith Muhammad Qasim my brother went to our 
land alongwith peter engine for the purpose of operating the tube-well. 
Maula Bakhsh accused came there. He asked us not to operate the tube-
well. Whereas myself and my brother Muhammad Qasim insisted that we 
would operate the tube-well on the ground that the tube-well is joint 
ownership including us. Meanwhile Ghulam Sarwar and Ghulam Hussain 
PWs came there and Maula Bakhsh went to his house. Thereafter we 
started the tube-well for the purpose of irrigating the land. At about 10:00 
am Maula Bakhsh came there alongwith his brothers. Maula Bakhsh 
accused present in police custody facing the trial of this case was armed 
with hatchet, Khair Bakhsh accused was armed with hatchet, Ellahi 
Bakhsh accused armed with hatchet, Rahim Bakhsh accused armed with 
hatchet and Faiz Bakhsh accused armed with Sota present on bail facing 
the trial of this case. Maula Bakhsh accused made a Lalkara that they 
would teach a lesson to us for starting/operating the tube-well. Maula 
Bakhsh accused gave a wrong side of hatchet blow on the right side of 
head of Muhammad Qasim (since deceased). Maula Bakhsh accused 
repeated the wrong side of hatchet blow over the right ear of Muhammad 
Qasim. Muhammad Qasim receiving the above said injuries fell down on

Bakhsh accused gave a wrong side of hatchet blow on my head. On our 
hue and cry the neighbors attracted and on the arrival of neighbors the 
accused persons went to their housed alongwith their respective weapons. 
Thereafter I alongwith Ghulam Sarwar, Ghulam Hussain and Muhammad 
Qasim went for police station for reporting the matter. When we were on 
our way Thanedar met us he prepared the necessary documents and sent us 
to the hospital with police constable he obtained my thumb impression.

succumbed to the injuries in the hospital Dera Ghazi Khan, Thereafter his 
dead body was shifted to Rojhan hospital where Thanedar sent the dead 
body to hospital for the purpose of post mortem examination alongwith 
necessary documents which was escorted by Haq Nawaz constable. I

according to my version. Thanedar made a promise that he would correct 
my statement according to my version. I asked Thanedar to read out my 
statement to me but my statement was not read over to me by Thanedar.

7.    On 19.11.2019, the Assistant District Public Prosecutor gave up the witness 
namely Shahzad Sharif 5574/C as being unnecessary. On 08.09.2020, the learned 
Assistant District Public Prosecutor  tendered in evidence the reports of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PV and Exh. PW) and closed the 
prosecution evidence. 
 
8. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined 
the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh  (convict)   and under 
section 342 Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question why this case against you and 
why the P.W.s have deposed against you, he replied that he was innocent and had 
been falsely involved in the case. Moula Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh  (convict)   
further stated that he had not committed any offence and had rather himself 
suffered serious injuries during the occurrence. The appellant namely Moula 
Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh  opted not to get himself examined under section 
340(2) Cr.P.C  however, produced documents (Exh.DD, Exh.DE, Exh.DF, 
Exh.DF/1, Exh.DF/2, Exh.DF/3, Exh.DF/4, Exh.DF/5,  Exh.DG and Exh.DH) as  
evidence in his defence.  
 
9. 
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Rojhan 
convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to above.  
  
10. 
The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant namely Moula 
Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh precisely is that the whole case is fabricated and 
false and the prosecution remained unable to prove the facts in issue and did not 

11 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
produce any unimpeachable, admissible, and relevant evidence. Learned counsel 
for the appellant further contended that the story of the prosecution mentioned in 
the statements of the witnesses, on the face of it, was highly improbable. Learned 
counsel for the appellant further contended that the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses were not worthy of any reliance. The learned counsel for the appellant 
also submitted that the recovery of the hatchet (P-5) from the appellant namely 
Moula Bakhsh was full of procedural defects, of no legal worth and value, and 
were result of fake proceedings. The learned counsel for the appellant finally 
submitted that the prosecution had totally failed to prove the case against the 
accused beyond the shadow of a doubt.   
 
11. 
On the other hand, the learned District Public Prosecutor along with the 
learned counsel for the complainant, contended that the prosecution had proved its 
case beyond the shadow of doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned 
District Public Prosecutor along with the learned counsel for the complainant 
further argued that the deceased died as a result of injuries suffered at the hands of 
the appellant. The learned District Public Prosecutor along with the learned 
counsel for the complainant further contended that the medical evidence also 
corroborated the statements of the eye witnesses. The learned District Public 
Prosecutor  along with the learned counsel for the complainant, further argued that 
the recovery of the hatchet (P-5) from the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh son of 
Rasool Bakhsh also corroborated the ocular account. The learned District Public 
Prosecutor along with the learned counsel for the complainant, further contended 
that there was no occasion for the prosecution witnesses, who were related to the 

12 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
deceased, to substitute the real offender with the innocent in this case. Lastly, the 
learned District Public Prosecutor along with the learned counsel for the 
complainant prayed for the rejection of the appeal as lodged by the appellant 
namely Moula Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh. The learned counsel for the 
complainant also argued that the Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 
2020, assailing the acquittal of Khair Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh,  Rahim 
Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh, Elahi Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh and Faiz 
Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh by the learned trial court from the charges also 
merited acceptance. 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned counsel for 
the complainant, the learned District Public Prosecutor and with their assistance 
carefully perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial. 
 
 13.  The learned District Public Prosecutor  has vehemently argued that as the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan was injured during the 
occurrence, therefore, his statement could not be doubted in any manner. The 
stamp of injuries on the person of a witness may be proof of his presence at the 
place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence, however the same can never 
guarantee a truthful deposition. Injuries received by a witness during an incident do 
not warrant acceptance of his evidence without scrutiny. At the most, such traumas 
can be taken as an indication of his presence on the spot, but still, his evidence is to 
be scrutinized on the benchmark of principles laid down for the appraisal of 
evidence. It is not a given that a witness who suffered injuries during the 
occurrence will depose nothing but the truth. Even otherwise, it is not the simple 

13 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
presence of a witness at the crime scene but his credibility, which makes him a 
reliable witness. It has been held by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
repeatedly that the facts that an injured witness narrates are not to be implicitly 
accepted rather, they are to be attested and appraised on the principles applied for 
the appreciation of evidence of any prosecution witness regardless of him being 
injured or not. Guidance is sought from the principle enunciated by the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Nazir Ahmad vs. Muhammad Iqbal and 
another (2011 SCMR 527) where at page 534 the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan , was pleased to hold as under: 
“It is settled law that injuries of P.W. are only indication of his presence 
at the spot but are not affirmative proof of his credibility and truth”. 
Guidance is also sought from the principle enunciated by the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of Amin Ali and another Vs. The State(2011 SCMR 
323) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold that the 
presence of injuries does not stamp a witness to be a truthful one and observed as 
under :-. 
“12. Certainly, the presence of the injured witnesses cannot be doubted at the 
place of incident, but the question is as to whether they are truthful witnesses 
or otherwise, because merely the injuries on the persons of P.Ws. would not 
stamp them truthful witnesses. It has been held in the case of Said Ahmed 
supra as under:-- 
  
"It is correct that the two eye-witnesses are injured and the injuries on 
their persons do indicate that they were not self-suffered. But that by 
itself would not s h o w  that they had, in view of the aforenoted 
circumstances, told the truth in the Court about the occurrence; 
particularly, also the role of the deceased and the eye-witnesses. It 
cannot be ignored that these two witnesses are closely related to the 
deceased, while the two other eye-witnesses mentioned in the F.I.R. 
namely,Abdur Rashid and Riasat were not examined at the trial. This 
further shows that the injured eyewitnesses wanted to withhold the 
material aspects of the case from the Court and the prosecution was 
apprehensive that if independent witnesses are examined, their 
depositions might support the plea of the accused."

In the case of Mehmood Hayat supra at page 1417, it has been observed as 
under:-- 
  
"10. There is no cavil with the proposition laid down in the case of Zaab 
Din and another v. The State (PLD 1986 Peshawar 188) that merely 
because the P.Ws. had stamp of firearm injuries on their person was not 
per se tantamount to a stamp of credence on their testimony." 
  
In the case of Mehmood Ahmed supra, this Court at page 7 observed as 
under: 
  
"For an injured witness whose presence at the occurrence is not 
disputed it can safely be concluded that he had witnessed the incident. 
But the facts he narrates are not to be implicitly accepted merely 
because he is an injured witness. His testimony is to be tested and 
appraised on the principles applied for appreciation of any other 
prosecution witness." 
  
13. From the above evidence of the P. Ws., they do not appear to be truthful 
witnesses; therefore, no implicit reliance can be placed on their evidence.” 
 
With this principle of appreciation of evidence in our minds that an injured witness 
cannot be presumed to be also a truthful witness, we have proceeded to examine 
the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) 
and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4). 
14. 
It is the case of the prosecution itself that Ghulam Hussain son of Darya 
Bakhsh, the brother of the deceased, was also injured during the occurrence, 
however, Ghulam Hussain son of Darya Bakhsh was never got examined as a 
prosecution witness  by the complainant of the case during the course of the trial 
despite the complainant seeking several adjournments to produce the said Ghulam 
Hussain son of Darya Bakhsh as a prosecution witness. In this manner, the 
prosecution case was not supported by Ghulam Hussain son of Darya Bakhsh, the 
brother of the deceased and also an injured witness.  
15.   A perusal of the evidence got recorded by the complainant of the case during 
the trial reveals that it was admitted by the prosecution witnesses namely 

15 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) that the occurrence had 
taken place in the land owned by the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh. It was also 
admitted by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and 
Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) that their residence was at a distance of 20 acres from the 
place of occurrence , whereas their land was at a distance of 1 ½ acre from the 
place of the occurrence. The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan 
(PW-3) during cross-examination admitted as under:- 
“ The acre in which bore was installed in that acre Maula Bakhsh accused 
cultivated wheat crop. 
…….. 
My house is at the distance of about 20 acre from the disputed tubewell bore. 
Myself and my brothers have 1½ acre of land where the disputed tubewell bore is 
situated” 
The prosecution witness namely Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) during cross-examination 
stated as under:- 
“Our own bore is near our houses at the distance of 20 acre from the disputed 
bore. Our personal tubewell could not irrigate the disputed land ” 
We have also noted that the reason as given by the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) for their presence at the 
place of occurrence was that the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan 
(PW-3) and the deceased had brought an engine to pump out water from the bore 
dug within the land of the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh in order for the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar 
(PW-4) to irrigate their lands and the prosecution witness namely Muhammad

Ramzan (PW-3) and the deceased had arrived at the place of occurrence at about 
07/07.30 a.m and started to pump out the water and continued to pump out water 
from the bore dug at the place of occurrence , using the engine brought by them to 
the place of occurrence to work the pump, till the occurrence took place. The 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) in his statement before 
the learned trial court , stated as under:- 
“ Thereafter we started the tube-well for the purpose of irrigating the land.  
……………… 
Myself and my deceased brother Qasim taken the peter with us and went to the 
disputed bore. 
….. 
Myself and Qasim reached at the place of occurrence at about 07/07:30 am 
alongwith peter engine. We started peter engine after our arrival over there 
whereas the occurrence was taken place at about 10:00 a.m 
……… 
We had peter engine, fan, belt/Patta and screw ranch for the purpose of tightening 
the nuts..” 
The prosecution witness namely Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) in his statement before 
the learned trial court , stated as under:- 
“ Qasim and complainant went to place of occurrence alongwith peter engine, 
diggi, fan and delivery pipe. The above said articles transported to the place of 
occurrence on”

Despite this claim of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-
3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) that their reason for their arrival at the place of 
occurrence was that the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) 
and the deceased had brought an engine to pump out water from the bore dug 
within the land of the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh and while the said engine 
was running that the incident took place, both the Investigating Officers of the case 
namely Muhammad Nasrullah, SI (PW-12) and Ashiq Hussain, SI (PW-13) 
admitted during cross-examination that at the time of their visits to the place of 
occurrence and even during the course of investigation as conducted by them, 
neither such an engine was taken into possession by them from the place of 
occurrence nor any such engine was produced before them during the course of the 
investigation . Muhammad Nasrullah, SI (PW-12) during cross-examination , 
admitted as under:- 
“ It is correct that peter engine is bone of contention between the party but I have 
not taken the peter engine into possession,however I took the photograph of peter 
engine. 
………….. 
I had not taken into possess (sic) the accessories of peter engine on my first visit 
at place of occurrence nor complainant produced the above said accessories 
before me.” 
 With regard to the statement of Muhammad Nasrullah, SI (PW-12) that he had 
taken the photographs of the engine available at the place of occurrence, this claim 
was denied by the prosecution witness namely Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) himself, 

18 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
who during cross-examination stated that the police had not taken any photographs 
of the engine. Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“ Peter engine was already fixed over there when police came there. Police had 
not taken any photograph of peter engine or of place of occurrence” 
(emphasis supplied)  
Moreover,  Ashiq Hussain, SI (PW-13), the other Investigating Officer of the case 
also admitted   during cross-examination that no such engine as taken by the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) to the place  of 
occurrence was produced before him during the course of investigation , and stated  
as under:- 
“The bone of contention was operating of peter engine between both the parties 
but that peter engine was not produced by the complainant before me nor I taken 
the peter engine in possession. ” 
The non-production of the engine which had been allegedly brought to the place of 
occurrence by the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and 
the deceased to pump out water from the bore dug within the land of the appellant 
namely Moula Bakhsh and  which  engine was running when the incident took 
place and the failure of Muhammad Nasrullah, SI (PW-12)  and Ashiq Hussain, SI 
(PW-13)  the Investigating Officers of the case, to take into possession the said 
engine,  leads to only one conclusion and that being that no such engine was 
available at the place of occurrence. Had such an engine been brought to the place 
of occurrence by the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and 
the deceased to pump out the water from the bore dug within the land of the 
appellant and  the said pumped out water was being used to irrigate the land of the 

19 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar 
(PW-4) , then the same must have been available at the place of occurrence, at the 
time of arrival of Muhammad Nasrullah, SI (PW-12) , the Investigating Officer of 
the case on the day of occurrence  and the same would necessarily have been taken 
into possession by the Investigating Officers of the case but it was not and it proves 
that a false claim was made by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) for their arrival at the place of 
occurrence and their continued presence at the place of occurrence, which place 
was admittedly the land of the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh. In this manner, the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar 
(PW-4)  failed miserably to prove that they had indeed arrived at the place of 
occurrence, at the time when the same was happening for the reason which was 
mentioned by them. In this manner, the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)   failed miserably to establish the 
reason for their presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence. The 
prosecution was under a bounden duty to establish that the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)  had a reason to 
proceed to the place of occurrence  and the reason for their continued presence at 
the place of occurrence. The failure of the prosecution to prove the said fact has 
vitiated our trust in the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) 
and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) as being truthful witnesses. 
15.    We have noted with serious anxiety that the ocular account of the occurrence 
as furnished by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and 
Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)   is inconsistent with the medical evidence as furnished by 

20 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020

Dr. Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8) and flawed beyond mending , resulting in 
disfiguring the complexion of the whole prosecution case beyond reparation and 
recognition. According to the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) they had seen the 
appellant namely Moula Bakhsh inflicted two injuries on the head of Muhammad 
Qasim (deceased) with the use of a hatchet. Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3),  in his 
statement before the learned trial court, stated as under:- 
“Maula Bakhsh. accused gave a wrong side of hatchet blow on the right side of 
head of Muhammad Qasim (since deceased). Maula Bakhsh accused repeated 
the wrong side of hatchet blow over the right ear of Muhammad Qasim. 
Muhammad Qasim receiving the above said injuries fell down on the ground. 
………….. 
I had stated in my statement before the police that Maula Bakhsh accused gave a 
wrong side of hatchet blow which was landed toward right side of head of my 
brother Qasim confronted with Exh.D.A where it is recorded as under 
موال بخش نے کلہاڑ
ی کا وار ک
ای جو غالم قاسم کو سر پر لگا 
Volunteered my statement was not correctly recorded by police. I had stated in 
my statement before the police that Maula Bakhsh accused repeated wrong side 
of hatchet blow which was landed at the right ear of my brother Muhammad 
Qasim confronted with Exh.D.A where it is recorded 
موال بخش نے کلہاڑ

Qasim my brother remained standing position after receiving first injury at his 
head, however he fell down after receiving the second injury on his right 
ear.”(emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) , in his statement before 
the learned trial court stated as under:- 
“Maula Bakhsh accused gave a wrong side of his hatchet blow at the right side of 
head of Muhammad Qasim. Maula Bakhsh accused repeated the wrong side blow 
of hatchet which was landed on the right ear of Muhammad Qasim. Muhammad 
Qasim after receiving the above said injuries fell down on the ground. 
…………… 
Again said Qasim fell down on the ground after receiving the second blow on the 
right side of ear.” (emphasis supplied)  
A perusal of the above referred statements of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) reveals that according to 
them the appellant had hit Muhammad Qasim (deceased) twice with the hatchet, 
one blow landing on the right side of the head of Muhammad Qasim (deceased)  
and the other blow landing on the right ear Muhammad Qasim (deceased) . 
Contrary to the above-referred statements of the eyewitnesses namely Muhammad 
Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) , Dr. Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8),  
who conducted the medical examination and later the post mortem examination of 
the dead body of the deceased namely  Muhammad Qasim, observed only one 
injury, present on the head  area of the dead body of Muhammad Qasim 
(deceased). Dr. Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8), on medically examining 
Muhammad Qasim son of Dariya Bakhsh ( then injured later deceased) on 
07.01.2019 had  observed as under :-

“INJURIES 
 
1. Lacerated wound of about 2 x 0.6 cm in size over the right parietal bone region. 
This wound has distance of 1.5 cm from right forehead. This wound has irregular 
margins and fresh blood is oozing from the wound.(emphasis supplied) . 
Subsequently, on 08.01.2019. Dr. Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8) on examining 
the dead body of the deceased namely Muhammad Qasim son of Dariya Bakhsh, 
observed as under:- 
                  “ INJURIES: 
 
1. Lacerated wound of about 2 x 0.6 cm in size over the right parietal 
bone region. This wound has distance of 1.5 cm from right forehead. 
This wound has irregular margins and fresh blood is oozing from the 
wound underlying skull bone was exposed/visible. 
 
2.   On examination fresh blood was running from the right ear. 
 
 
 
 
3.    Bruise of about 0.8 cm x 0.2 cm in size over posterior aspect of right     
 
 
 
      hand underlying skin was slightly reddish 
 
4.   Abrasion of about 5 cm x 1 cm in size over the dorsal aspect of right     
 
foot just superficial skin was peeled off. 
 
5.   Scratch mark of about 2 cm x 0.5 cm in size over a right clavicle, 
 
Dr. Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8)  , during cross-examination explained that he 
had observed only one injury on the head region of Muhammad Qasim 
(deceased) and the said injury had been caused by use of a single blow and stated 
as under:- 
“In injury No 1 of Muhammad Qasim deceases through  CT Scan report, I have 
mentioned fracture of temporal and parietal bone which is with single blow but 
two fractures” 
Dr. Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8) explained that only blood was coming out of 
the ear and it was not as a result of any independent injury suffered by the 
deceased on his right ear rather the flow of blood was due to the fracture of the

Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020

skull bone. The said opinion and observations of Dr. Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-
8) , that he observed only one injury, present on the head region of the dead body 
of Muhammad Qasim (deceased) , was never challenged by the prosecution either 
during the investigation of the case or during the course of the trial. In this manner, 
the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) 
and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) are in direct contradiction and in conflict with the 
opinion and observations of Dr. Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8) . The prosecution 
witnesses very well knew that the observations and opinion of Dr. Muhammad 
Sajid Jamil (PW-8) , were in themselves sufficient to shatter the very foundation 
upon which the prosecution case was built, however, even being in knowledge of 
this fact, no effort was made by the prosecution witnesses to challenge the 
observations and opinion of Dr. Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8)   or if the same 
could not be challenged, then to explain the same. Despite our repeated queries, the 
learned District Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the complainant have  
failed to explain the said discrepancy in the prosecution evidence. In this manner, 
irreconcilable and harrowing contradictions have cropped up in the ocular account 
of the occurrence as narrated by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) and the medical evidence as 
furnished by Dr. Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8) . The contradictions in the ocular 
account of the occurrence, as narrated by Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and 
Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)  and the medical evidence as furnished by Dr. Muhammad 
Sajid Jamil (PW-8) , clearly establish that the prosecution miserably failed to prove 
the charge against the appellant. The contradictions in the ocular account of the 
occurrence, as narrated by Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-
4) and the medical evidence, as furnished by Dr. Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8), 

24 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020

sound the death knell for the prosecution case and prove to be the cause of its sad 
demise. Had the witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam 
Sarwar (PW-4) deposed truthfully then there did not exist any possibility that they 
would have fallen into error. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of 
“Muhammad Shafi alias Kuddoo vs. The State and others ” (2019 S C M R 1045) 
has held as under:- 
“Ocular account is in conflict with medical evidence inasmuch as according to 
the crime report both the appellant, as well as, Abdul Razzaq, co-accused, are 
assigned one blow each to the deceased, whereas according to the initial medical 
examination, Medical Officer noted solitary injury on the head, its impact on the 
eye has been utilized by the witnesses to array the latter in the crime.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Muhammad Zaman  vs. The State and 
others ” (2014 S C M R 749) wherein it has been held as under:- 
“The more so, when the total number of injuries found on the deceased as well as 
the injured could be caused by one or two L.G. Cartridges. The number of 
assailants in the circumstances of the case appears to have been exaggerated” 
Reliance is placed on the cases of “Muhammad Ali Vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 
137) “Muhammad Ashraf Vs. The State” ( 2012 S C M R 419) ,USMAN alias 
KALOO Vs. The State (2017 S C M R 622) ,Muhammad Hussain Vs. The State 
(2008 S C M R 345) and “Ain Ali and another Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 323) 
where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to reject the evidence of 
prosecution witnesses when the same was found to be in contrast with the medical 
evidence.  
16.   Another aspect drawing our grave concern is the fact that the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) made 
blatant improvements to their previous statements in order to bring the ocular 
account as narrated by them, in line with the opinion and observations of Dr. 

25 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8), who had conducted the post mortem examination 
of the dead body . The prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) 
and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)  went on to claim that Khair Bakhsh, Elahi Bakhsh 
and Faiz Bakhsh ( all since acquitted), the co-accused of the appellant , had also 
inflicted injuries upon Muhammad Qasim (deceased) after realizing that Dr. 
Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8) had observed the presence of bruise, abrasion and 
scratch mark on the right hand, right foot and right clavicle of the dead body of the 
deceased respectively, though the infliction of the said injuries by Khair Bakhsh, 
Elahi Bakhsh and Faiz Bakhsh , all since acquitted, to the deceased was not 
mentioned by them in their previous statements. The prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) was cross-examined in this regard and the learned 
trial court observed as under:- 
I had stated in my statement before the police that Khair Bakhsh accused gave a 
wrong side of hatchet blow which was landed on the right collar, bone of 
Muhammad Qasim confronted with Exh.D.A where no such blow is 
mentioned. 
………….. 
I had stated in my statement before the police that Faiz Bakhsh accused gave sota 
blow at the right hand of my brother Muhammad Qasim confronted with 
Exh.D.A where it is not so recorded volunteered my statement was not correctly 
recorded by police. 
……………. 
I had stated in my statement before the police that Faiz Bakhsh accused made sota 
blow on the left forehand of Ghulam Hussain confronted with Exh.D.A where it 

26 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
is not so recorded volunteered my statement was not correctly recorded by 
police. (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)  was also cross-examined 
in this regard and the learned trial court observed as under:- 
“I had stated in my statement Exh.D.C that Faiz Bakhsh accused gave a sota blow 
which hit Ghulam Hussain on his left forearm confronted with Exh.D.C where 
it is not so recorded. I had stated before the police that Faiz Bakhsh accused gave 
a sota blow on the right hand of Muhammad Qasim confronted with Exh.D.C 
where it is not so recorded.” (emphasis supplied)  
17. 
     We have also noted with grave concern that the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) also went on to 
claim that the accused, though armed with hatchets, had used the blunt sides of the 
said hatchets to inflict the injuries upon the deceased though in their previous 
statements they had not made any such claim that the accused had used the blunt 
sides of the hatchets to inflict the injuries to the deceased. The prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) made 
a deliberate and dishonest departure from their earlier narrations of the occurrence 
while deposing before the learned trial court. The prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) was cross-examined in this regard and the learned 
trial court observed as under:- 
“I had stated in my statement before the police that Ellahi Bakhsh accused gave 
wrong side of hatchet blow on the right foot of my brother Muhammad Qasim 
confronted with Exh.D.A where wrong side of hatchet is not mentioned.  
…………. 

27 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
I had stated in my statement before the police that Rahim Bakhsh accused made a 
wrong side of hatchet blow on the finger of right hand of Ghulam Hussain 
conformed with Exh.D.A where wrong side of hatchet is not mentioned.  
………….. 
I had stated in my statement before the police that Khair Bakhsh accused gave a 
wrong side of hatchet blow on my head confronted with Exh.D.A where wrong 
side of hatchet is not mentioned (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)  was also cross-examined 
in this regard and the learned trial court observed as under:- 
“ I had stated in my statement before the police Exh.D.C that Khair Bakhsh 
accused gave a wrong side of hatchet blow at the right collar bone of my brother 
Muhammad Qasim deceased confronted with Exh.D.C where it is not so 
recorded.” (emphasis supplied)  
By improving their previous statements, the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)   impeached their own 
credit. Article 151 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 provides as under: - 
“151. Impeaching credit of witness. The credit of a witness may be 
impeached in the following ways by the adverse party, or, with the consent 
of the Court, by the party who calls him: 
(1) by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their knowledge 
of the witness, believe him to be un worthy of credit; 
(2) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of a 
bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence; 
(3) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his 
evidence which is liable to be contradicted ;”

As the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam 
Sarwar (PW-4) introduced dishonest, blatant and substantial improvements to their 
previous statements and were duly confronted with their former statements, hence 
their credit stands impeached and the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) cannot be relied upon, being proved 
to have deposed with a slight, intended to mislead the court. The august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Ashraf Vs. State” (2012 SCMR 419) 
took serious notice of the improvements introduced by witnesses and rejected their 
evidence. We, thus, are satisfied that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) has no intrinsic 
worth and is to be rejected outrightly. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in a 
recent case reported as “Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 772) 
has enunciated the following principle: 
 “Once the Court comes to the conclusion that the eye witnesses had made 
dishonest improvements in their statements then it is not safe to place 
reliance on their statements. It is also settled by this Court that whenever a 
witness made dishonest improvement in his version in order to bring his 
case in line with the medical evidence or in order to strengthen the 
prosecution case then his testimony is not worthy of credence”. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as Muhammad Arif Vs. 
The State (2019 SCMR 631) has enunciated the following principle: 
 “It is well established by now that when a witness improves his statement 
and moment it is observed that the said improvement was made dishonestly 
to strengthen the prosecution, such portion of his statement is to be 
discarded out of consideration. Having observed the improvements in the 
statements of both the witnesses of ocular account, we hold that it is not safe 
to rely on their testimony to maintain conviction and sentence of 
Muhammad Arif (appellant) on a capital charge.”  
Guidance is sought from the principle enunciated by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of “Amin Ali and another Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 323) 

29 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to reject the evidence of 
injured witnesses and held as under:-  
“11. All the three witnesses deposed that the deceased had received three 
injuries, but the Medical Officer found six injuries on the person of the 
deceased. One of them had blackening. None of the witnesses deposed that 
any of the appellants had caused the injuries from a close range but on the 
contrary in the site plan the place of firing has been shown 8 feet away from 
the deceased. Thus from such a distance injury with blackening cannot be 
caused as it can be caused from a distance of less than 3 feet as per Modi's 
Medical Jurisprudence. The Medical Officer did not show as to which of the 
injury was entry or exit wound on the person of the deceased. The medical 
officer stated that metalic projectile was recovered from wound No.1/B which 
was an exit wound. If it was an exit wound then the metalic projectile would 
have been out of the body. The presence of metalic projectile in the body 
clearly establishes the fact that it is not an exit wound but an entry wound. 
The medical officer has not shown that any of the injuries had inverted or 
averted margins so as to ascertain as to which of the injuries is entry or exit 
wound. Thus on this count there is a conflict between the medical and oral 
evidence. Furthermore, according to Medical Officer, the P.W.15 had four 
injuries out of them two were entry and two were exit wounds but the P.Ws. 
13 and 14 deposed that the injured had received three injuries. Thus the 
P.Ws. have shown one exit wound as entry wound. With regard to the injured 
Tanveer Hussain, the Medical Officer showed two injuries one entry wound 
on the chest and one exit wound on the back but all the three eye-witnesses 
deposed that P.W.14 had received two injuries on his chest. As regards 
injuries on the person of Mst. Maqbool Bibi. The Medical Officer found one 
entry wound on her back with blackening, whereas P.Ws. 13, 14 and 15 
deposed that the fire shot was fired from the roof of the shop. Entry wound 
with blackening marks cannot be caused from such a long distance. From the 
above position it is manifest that the ocular testimony is in conflict with the 
medical evidence. Thus, the deceased and injured did not receive the injuries 
in the manner, as alleged by the prosecution. 
………………………………. 
13. From the above evidence of the P. Ws., they do not appear to be truthful 
witnesses; therefore, no implicit reliance can be placed on their evidence.” 
 
18. 
The case of the eye witness namely Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)  as produced by 
the complainant before the learned trial court is in itself very unique. It was proved 
through cross-examination upon the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)  that the prosecution witness namely 
Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)  was not mentioned as a witness of the occurrence in the 
oral statement (Exh. PQ) of Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3)  upon the basis of which 

30 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
the formal F.I.R (Exh. PR) was registered. This fact that Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) 
was not named as a witness in the oral statement (Exh.PQ) is apparent from the 
perusal of the said oral statement (Exh.PQ). The prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) was cross-examined in this regard and the learned 
trial court observed as under:- 
“ I had stated in my statement before the police that Ghulam Sarwar and Ghulam 
Hussain PWS came at the place of occurrence prior to the occurrence and Maula 
Bakhsh accused after giving warning to us went back to his house confronted with 
Exh.D.A where it is written during the occurrence as under: 
شورو واو
لہ ی پر غالم حس
نی برادرم موقع پر آ گ
یا۔ 
Muhammad Nasrullah, SI (PW-12) , the Investigating Officer of the case who also 
admitted during cross-examination that the prosecution witness namely Ghulam 
Sarwar (PW-4)  was not named as a witness by the complainant in the oral 
statement (Exh. PQ) and the name of Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)   as a witness was 
got added by Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3)  by way of getting his supplementary 
statement recorded. Muhammad Nasrullah, SI (PW-12), during cross-examination,  
stated as under:- 
“On very first day I recorded the supplementary statement of the 
complainant in which he added the name of other witness Ghulam Sarwar 
and the complainant further explained that all the accused persons which were 
armed with hatchets used the wrong side of hatchets. ” (emphasis supplied)  
In this manner, there remains no doubt that the prosecution witness namely 
Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) had not witnessed the occurrence and his name was added 
subsequently only to prop up the failing prosecution case.

19. 
    The learned District Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the 
complainant placed much emphasis on the promptitude with which the oral 
statement (Exh. PQ) of Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) was recorded by Wazir 
Ahmad, SI (PW-10), and stated that this excluded the possibility of any pre-concert 
prior to the recording of the oral statement (Exh. PQ). Despite the insistence of the 
learned District Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the complainant that 
for the fact that oral statement (Exh.PQ) of Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) was 
recorded with remarkable promptitude therefore it offered sufficient corroboration 
of the prosecution case, both the learned District Public Prosecutor and the learned 
counsel for the complainant are unable to explain that when the oral statement 
(Exh.PQ) of Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) was declared to be a fake document by 
the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam 
Sarwar (PW-4) themselves then how any reliance can be placed upon the same. 
During the course of the trial, it remained a consistent theme with the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) that 
the oral statement (Exh.PQ) of Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) was a sham document. 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) himself in his 
statement before the learned trial court , stated as under:- 
“ I asked the Thanedar that he had not correctly recorded my statement according 
to my version. Thanedar made a promise that he would correct my statement 
according to my version. I asked Thanedar to read out my statement to me but my 
statement was not read over to me by Thanedar.” 
Similarly, the prosecution witness namely Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) in his statement 
before the learned trial court , claimed that signatures of Muhammad Ramzan 

32 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
(PW-3) were obtained on blank papers on 07.01.2019 and subsequently a false 
document (Exh.PQ) was prepared. Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) in his statement before 
the learned trial court, stated as under:- 
“After the occurrence we were going to the police station for reporting the matter 
and Thanedar met us. Police obtained thumb impression of Muhammad 
Ramzan complainant on blank paper and sent us to Rojhan hospital alongwith 
the constable. 
………. 
FIR of this case was not read over to us by Thanedar” (emphasis supplied)  
 The scrutiny of the statements of the prosecution witnesses reveals that the oral 
statement (Exh. P.Q.) of Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) was declared as  a contrived, 
manufactured and a compromised document by the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) themselves. No 
corroboration of the prosecution evidence can be had from the said oral statement 
(Exh. PQ) of Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3). 
20.  
 The learned District Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the 
complainant, have submitted that the recovery of the Hatchet (P-5) from the 
appellant namely Moula Bakhsh offered sufficient corroboration of the statements 
of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam 
Sarwar (PW-4). Regarding the recovery of the Hatchet (P-5) from the appellant 
namely Moula Bakhsh, the same cannot be relied upon as the Investigating Officer 
of the case, did not join any witness of the locality during the recovery of the 
Hatchet (P-5) from the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh  which was in clear 
violation of section 103 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. The provisions of 

33 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
section 103 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, unfortunately, are honoured 
more in disuse than compliance. To appreciate it better, this section is being 
reproduced:- 
"103.--(1) Before making a search under this chapter, the officer or other 
person about to make it shall call upon two or more respectable 
inhabitants of the locality in which the place to be searched is situate 
to attend and witness the search and may issue an order in writing to 
them or any of them so to do.” 
 
Therefore, the evidence of the recovery of the Hatchet (P-5) from the appellant 
namely Moula Bakhsh, being evidence that was obtained through illegal means 
and hence hit by the exclusionary rule of evidence The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Ismail and others Vs. The State ( 2017 SCMR 
898) at page 901 has held as under:- 
“For the above mentioned recovery of weapons the prosecution had failed to 
associate any independent witness of the locality and, thus, the mandatory 
provisions of section 103, Cr.P.C. had flagrantly been violated in that regard.”  
 
Moreover Ashiq Hussain, SI (PW-13) ,Investigating Officer of the case ,admitted 
that the Hatchet (P-5) was recovered from a house which was inhabited by other 
persons and from a room which was open to access.  Ashiq Hussain, SI (PW-13) 
,Investigating Officer of the case , during cross examination ,admitted as under :- 
“When I went for recovery of weapons of offence, at that time the families of 
accused persons were there. The rooms from where the recovery of weapons were 
effected were opened and that were not bolted nor locked” 
In this manner,the prosecution could not prove that the Hatchet (P-5)  was 
recovered froma place which was under the exclusive possession of the the 

34 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
appellant. Another aspect regarding the recovery of the Hatchet (P-5) from the 
appellant is that the occurrence took place on 07.01.2019, whereas the Hatchet (P-
5) was received in the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, on 
27.03.2019 and was analyzed on 08.11.2019. During such a long period the blood 
available on the Hatchet (P-5), if any, would have disintegrated. It is not possible 
to believe that the blood available on the Hatchet (P-5) had not disintegrated by the 
time the same was analyzed by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore and it 
was, therefore scientifically impossible to detect the origin of the blood. The august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Faisal Mehmood Vs. The State” (2016 
SCMR 2138) has held as under:- 
“The report of the Chemical Examiner showing the recovered hatchet to be 
stained with blood is dated 20.12.2002 whereas the report of the Serologist 
showing the origin of the blood available on the recovered hatchet to be 
human blood is dated 25.05.2004. It was scientifically impossible to detect 
the origin of the blood after about two years of the occurrence because 
human blood disintegrates in a period of about three weeks.”  
 
Therefore, the recovery of the Hatchet (P-5) from the appellant does not further 
the case of prosecution in any manner. In view of the above mentioned facts, the 
alleged recovery of the Hatchet (P-5) is not proved and the same cannot be used 
as a circumstance against the appellant. Even otherwise as we have disbelieved 
the ocular account in this case, hence the evidence of recovery would have no 
consequence. It is an admitted rule of appreciation of evidence that recovery is 
only a supporttive piece of evidence and if the ocular account is found to be 
unreliable then the recovery has no evidentiary value.

Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
21. The learned District Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and submitted that it 
corroborated the ocular account. The motive of the occurrence as stated by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar 
(PW-4) was that the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh was named as accused by 
the deceased in a case got registered by the deceased regarding the theft of his 
goats and the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh committed the Qatl-i-Amd of the 
deceased due to the said grudge. A perusal of the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) 
reveals that they failed to prove the motive of the occurrence as narrated by them 
in their statements before the learned trial court. The prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) admitted during cross-examination that the case got 
registered by the deceased regarding the theft of his goats has already been settled 
for the fact that the deceased had withdrawn from the prosecution of the said case. 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) during cross-
examination, admitted as under:- 
“ My brother Qasim deceased of this case got registered FIR No.190/18 u/s 379 
PPC at P.S Rojhan I was PW in that case. The accused persons returned our stolen 
property thereafter we entered into compromise with them. My brother Qasim 
tendered his compromising affidavit in favour of accused persons. Due to above 
said grudge, the accused persons committed the murder of my brother.” 
The other prosecution witness namely Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) stated that he had 
no knowledge regarding the details of the case got registered by the deceased 
against the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh as he was not witness of the said case.  
Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) during cross-examination, admitted as under:- 

36 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
“I was not witness in theft case which was got registered by Qasim deceased ” 
The above referred portions of the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) clearly prove that the 
prosecution witnesses failed to provide evidence enabling us to determine the 
truthfulness of the motive alleged. The prosecution witnesses failed to prove the 
fact that the said motive was so compelling that it could have led the appellant to 
have committed the Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased. There is a haunting silence with 
regard to the minutiae of motive alleged. No independent witness was produced by 
the prosecution to prove the motive as alleged.  Moreover, it is an admitted rule of 
appreciation of evidence that motive is only supportive piece of evidence and if the 
ocular account is found to be unreliable then motive alone cannot be made basis of 
conviction. Even otherwise a tainted piece of evidence cannot corroborate another 
tainted piece of evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the 
case of Muhammad Javed v. The State (2016 SCMR 2021) as under: 
“The said related and chance witnesses had failed to receive any 
independent corroboration inasmuch as no independent proof of the 
motive set up by the prosecution had been brought on the record of the 
case.” 
 
22.          The learned District Public Prosecutor and learned counsel for the 
complainant have also laid much stress upon the stance taken by the learned 
counsel representing the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh  at 
the time of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) and while getting the statement  of 
the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh recorded under section 342 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898. It was suggested by the learned counsel representing the 

37 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
appellant namely Moula Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh  to the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4)  that  
when the appellant was himself injured during the occurrence. Suffice is to observe 
that the onus to prove the facts in issue never shifts and always lies on the 
prosecution. That the law is quite settled by now that if the prosecution fails to 
prove its case against an accused person then the accused person is to be acquitted 
even if he had taken a plea and had thereby admitted killing the deceased. 
Furthermore, though it has been argued by the learned District Public Prosecutor 
and the learned counsel for the complainant that the appellant had claimed to have 
received injuries in the incident, however, both the learned District Public 
Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the complainant have admitted that no 
evidence was got recorded by the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh so as to prove 
this claim and even the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) 
and Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) did not admit that the appellant namely Moula Bakhsh 
was injured during the incident. In absence of any evidence available on the record 
of the instant case, no presumption can be drawn that the appellant namely Moula 
Bakhsh  must have been injured during the occurrence.  The suggestions as put by 
the learned counsel representing the accused and the documents (Exh.DD, Exh.DE, 
Exh.DF, Exh.DF/1, Exh.DF/2, Exh.DF/3, Exh.DF/4, Exh.DF/5,  Exh.DG and 
Exh.DH) hardly provide any substantiation to the prosecution case. Reliance is 
placed on the case of Azhar Iqbal Vs. The State (2013 SCMR 383) wherein the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:- 
“It had not been appreciated by the learned courts below that the law is quite 
settled by now that if the prosecution fails to prove its case against an 
accused person then the accused person is to be acquitted even if he had 

38 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
taken a plea and had thereby admitted killing the deceased. A reference in 
this respect may be made to the case of Waqar Ahmed v. Shaukat Ali and 
others (2006 SCMR 1139). The law is equally settled that the statement  of an 
accused person recorded under section 342, Cr.P.C. is to be accepted or 
rejected in its entirety and where the prosecution's evidence is found to be 
reliable and the exculpatory part of the accused person's statement is 
established to be false and is to be excluded from consideration then the 
inculpatory part of the accused person's statement may be read in support of 
the evidence of the prosecution. This legal position stands amply 
demonstrated in the cases of Sultan Khan v. Sher Khan and others (PLD 
1991 SC 520), Muhammad Tashfeen and others v. The State and others (2006 
SCMR 577) and Faqir Muhammad and another v. The State (PLD 2011 SC 
796). It is unfortunate that the Lahore High Court, Lahore  had  failed  to  
apply  the  said  settled  law  to  the  facts  of  the case in hand.” 
 
23. 
 
Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in 
our minds regarding the involvement of Moula Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh  
(appellant) in the present case. It is a settled principle of law that for giving the 
benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there should be so many circumstances 
rather, if only a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in the mind of a 
prudent person is available, then such benefit is to be extended to an accused not as 
a matter of concession but as of right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of "Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State" (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the 
following principle: 
"Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an accused it 
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubt. 
If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent 
mind about the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be entitled to 
the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and concession, but as a 
matter of right. It is based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty 
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted". 
Reliance in this behalf can be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The 
State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State (2008 
SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and 
Muhammad Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749)." 
 

39 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
"Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State" (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has been held as 
infra: 
"9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is not a 
ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete justice. This is 
an established principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 
guilty persons should let off but one innocent person should not suffer. 
As the preeminent English jurist William Blackstone wrote, "Better that 
ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer." Benjamin 
Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of early American history, 
went further arguing "it is better a hundred guilty persons should 
escape than one innocent person should suffer." All the contradictions 
noted by the learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of 
doubt on the prosecution's case, which entitles the petitioner to the 
right of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for 
the accused to be afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not 
necessary that there should be many circumstances creating 
uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the benefit of the same must 
got to the petitioner. This Court in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The 
State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the the earlier judgments of 
this Court has categorically held that "if a single circumstance creates 
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the apprehension of guilt of 
an accused, then he/she shall be entitled to such benefit not as a matter 
of grace and concession, but as of right. Reference in this regard may 
be made to the cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) 
and Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)." The same view was 
reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court 
observed that once a single loophole is observed in a case presented by 
the prosecution, such as conflict in the ocular account and medical 
evidence or presence of eye-witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of 
such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution's case automatically goes in 
favour of an accused.” 
24.  
 For what has been discussed above, Criminal Appeal No.438 of 2020lodged 
by Moula Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh (appellant) is allowed. The conviction and 
sentence of Moula Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh (appellant) awarded by the 
learned trial court through the impugned judgment dated 29.09.2020 are hereby 
set-aside. Moula Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh (appellant) is ordered to be 
acquitted by extending him the benefit of doubt. The appellant namely Moula 
Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh is in custody and he is directed to be released 
forthwith if not required in any other case.

Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020

25. 
The complainant of the case filed Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 
of 2020 seeking permission to file an appeal against the acquittal of Khair Bakhsh 
son of Rasool Bakhsh, Rahim Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh, Elahi Bakhsh son of 
Rasool Bakhsh and Faiz Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh( all since acquitted). We 
have observed that the learned trial court has rightly acquitted the said accused. We 
have scrutinized the statements of the prosecution witnesses and have come to the 
irresistible conclusion that the prosecution witnesses could not prove the facts in 
issue. The prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam 
Sarwar (PW-4)  went on to claim that Khair Bakhsh, Elahi Bakhsh and Faiz 
Bakhsh , all since acquitted, had also inflicted injuries upon Muhammad Qasim 
(deceased) after realizing that Dr. Muhammad Sajid Jamil (PW-8) had observed 
the presence of bruise, abrasion and scratch mark on the right hand , right foot and 
right clavicle of the dead body of the deceased respectively, though the infliction 
of the said injuries by  Khair Bakhsh, Elahi Bakhsh and Faiz Bakhsh , all since 
acquitted, was not mentioned by them in their previous statements. The 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and Ghulam Sarwar 
(PW-4) also went on to state that the accused, though armed with hatchets, had 
used the blunt sides of the said hatchets to inflict the injuries upon the deceased 
though in their previous statements they had not made any such claim that the 
accused had used the blunt sides of the hatchets to inflict the injuries to the 
deceased. The prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Ramzan (PW-3) and 
Ghulam Sarwar (PW-4) made a deliberate and deceitful departure from their earlier 
narrations of the occurrence while deposing before the learned trial court, 
impeaching their credit. It   is   important   to   note   that   according to the 
established principle of the criminal administration of justice once an acquittal is  

41 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
recorded in  favour of accused facing criminal  charge  he enjoys  double 
presumption  of innocence, therefore, the courts competent to interfere in the 
acquittal order should be slow in converting the same into conviction,  unless and  
until  the  said  order is patently illegal, shocking, based on misreading and  non-
reading  of  the record or perverse. The said principle has been enunciated by the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the judgment reported as “Ghulam Sikandar 
and another Versus Mamaraz Khan and Others” (P L D 1985 Supreme Court 11) 
wherein it has been held as under: 
“The Court would not interfere with acquittal merely because on re-
appraisal of the evidence it comes to the conclusion different from that of 
the Court acquitting the accused provided both the conclusions are 
reasonably possible. If however. the conclusion reached by that Court was 
such that no reasonable person would conceivably reach the same and was 
impossible then this Court would interfere in exceptional cases on 
overwhelming proof resulting in conclusion and irresistible conclusion; and 
that too with a view only to avoid grave miscarriage of justice and for no 
other purpose. The important test visualised in these cases, in this behalf 
was that the finding sought to be interfered with, after scrutiny under the 
foregoing searching light, should be found wholly as artificial, shocking and 
ridiculous.” 
 
Reliance is also placed on the  judgment  reported as Muhammad   Inayat   Versus   
The   State ( 1998   SCMR   1854) wherein it has been held as under: 
“The judgment of acquittal qua Muhammad Yousaf, Muhammad Sated and 
Muhammad Nawaz cannot, in the given situation, be termed as perverse or 
foolish inasmuch as the view having been taken by the High Court can possibly 
be taken for acquitting them in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this 
case. It cannot be said that the impugned judgment of the High Court 
acquitting Muhammad Yousaf and two others is fanciful, artificial, shocking or 
ridiculous. 1t is based on convincing reasons”." 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Mst. Sughran Begum and 
another Vs. Qaiser Pervaiz and others” (2015 SCMR 1142) has held as under: 
“On acquittal, an accused person earns twofold innocence particularly, in the 
case when there are concurrent findings to that effect by the trial Court and the 
Court of First Appeal (High Court), is the bedrock principle of justice. In a 

42 
Murder Reference No.31 of 2020 
Criminal Appeal    No. 438 of 2020 
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 
 
case of acquittal, the standard and principle of appreciation of evidence is 
entirely different from that in a case of conviction. Unless the concurrent 
findings of the two Courts below are found perverse, fanciful, arbitrary and are 
based on misreading and non-reading of material evidence causing 
miscarriage of justice, the Supreme Court would not lightly disturb the same 
because on reappraisal, another view might be possible therefore, sanctity is 
attached under the law to such concurrent findings in ordinary course.” 
 
 Pursuant to the discussion made and conclusions arrived at above, the Petition for 
Special Leave to Appeal No.54 of 2020 as filed by the complainant, seeking 
permission to file an appeal against the acquittal of Khair Bakhsh son of Rasool 
Bakhsh,  Rahim Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh, Elahi Bakhsh son of Rasool Bakhsh
