Mr Muhammad Ejaz, Advocate, for the Petitioner. 
 
Ms Rahat Majeed, Assistant District Public Prosecutor, with 
Muhammad Safdar Ali/ASI. 
 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – By this application, the 
Petitioner seeks post-arrest bail in case FIR No.17/2023 dated 7.1.2023 
registered at Police Station Saddar Kamalia, District Toba Tek Singh, 
for an offence under section 22(1) of the Punjab Food Authority Act, 
2011 (the “PFA Act”). 
2. 
 
According to the FIR, the prosecution case is that the 
Petitioner has set up a milk collection centre at 54/2, Takra Kamalia. On 
7.1.2023 at around 11:00 a.m., Asim Shabbir, Food Safety Officer  
(the “FSO”), examined the milk at that location and found it 
substandard. Consequent thereupon, he destroyed 480 litres of it. He sent 
the samples drawn from the stock to the laboratory, which confirmed 
that it was adulterated with fat other than milk fat. 
3. 
 
The Petitioner’s counsel, Mr Muhammad Ejaz, Advocate, 
contends that the Public Analyst’s report is necessary to prosecute a 
person under section 22(1) of the PFA Act for selling or offering for sale 
adulterated food. In the present case, the FSO failed to collect milk 
samples in accordance with Rule 52 of the Punjab Pure Food Rules, 
2011. As a result, the Public Analyst’s report dated 10.1.2023 cannot be 
relied upon. He further contends that the Petitioner is a first-time 
offender, and the offence he is charged with does not fall under the 
prohibitory clause. 
4. 
 
The Assistant District Public Prosecutor contends that the 
statements of the PWs and the Public Analyst’s report prima facie 

Crl. Misc. No.17013/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
 
establish that the Petitioner has committed the alleged offence. She 
maintains that Rule 52 is directory, not mandatory, and its non-
compliance has no bearing on the prosecution’s case. She further states 
that the Petitioner has not brought any material on record that may 
suggest that the FIR against him is false. The fact that the offence under 
section 22(1) of the Act does not fall under the prohibitory clause does 
not automatically entitle the Petitioner to post-arrest bail. His illicit sale 
of adulterated milk impacts the general populace, making him ineligible 
for any indulgence from this Court.

The Pure Food Ordinance, 1960 (the “1960 Ordinance”), 
consolidated and amended the law relating to the preparation and sale of 
foods in West Pakistan, which remained in force in the Punjab for more 
than five decades. On 6th July 2011, the Punjab Food Authority Act 
2011 (the “PFA Act”) was enacted but not immediately implemented. 
Section 1(3) of the Act provided that it shall come into force on such 
date as the Punjab Government may specify by a notification. It also 
authorized it to set separate dates for different areas. The PFA Act was 
enforced in the Lahore District only w.e.f. 2nd July 2012 vide 
Notification No.SOF-IV-II-7/2011 of even date. Thereafter it was 
gradually extended to more districts and, as of 2017, applied throughout 
the province.1 
7. 
 
In exercise of the powers conferred by section 37 of the 
1960 Ordinance, the Governor of the Punjab framed the Punjab Pure 
Food Rules, 2011, vide Notification No. SRO(PH)1-47/68 dated 29th 
September 2011. They superseded the Punjab Pure Food Rules of 2007. 
8. 
 
The PFA Act has repealed the Ordinance of 1960, but 
section 58(3) thereof has preserved the Punjab Pure Food Rules, 2011 
(the “Food Rules”). The said provision is reproduced below for ready 
reference:

In Commissioner of Income Tax, Peshawar v. Islamic 
Investment Bank Ltd. (2016 SCMR 816), the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan explained the effect of a saving clause as follows: 
“When a statute repeals an earlier statute, and it is an unqualified 
repeal, then the effect of such repeal is that the earlier statute gets 
repealed in its entirety. However, where the Legislature intends to 
preserve any power or inchoate right in relation to the repealed 
statute, then a saving clause is incorporated in the repealing statute 
whereby certain provisions are preserved from getting repealed to the 
extent and with regard to the subject mentioned in the saving clause. 
The provisions of the repealed law that are so preserved are to be 
regarded as if the repealed statute was still in operation.” 
10. 
 
The PFA Act aims to protect public health, provide for food 
safety and standards, and establish the Punjab Food Authority.2 Section 
56 of the Act empowers the Provincial Government to frame rules for 
carrying out the purposes of the Act, and section 57 authorizes the Food 
Authority to make regulations. The Government has not drawn any new 
Rules under section 56 of the Act so far. Resultantly, the Food Rules of 
2011 mentioned above continue to hold the field. 
11. 
 
Rules 50 and 51 of the Food Rules of 2011 outline the 
method for taking food samples and packing them for analysis. Rule 52 
specifies the quantity of a sample that must be provided to the Public 
Analyst. It reads as follows: 
52. 
Quantity of sample.– The quantity of a sample to be supplied 
for analysis to a Public Analyst shall not be less than specified below:

It is by now well settled that the Rules validly made 
under a statute have the same effect as the statute itself and are 
enforced as such. The Supreme Court of India highlighted this point 
in State of Uttar Pradesh and others v. Babu Ram Upadhya  
(AIR 1961 SC 751) as under: 
“Rules made under a statute must be treated for all purposes of 
construction or obligation exactly as if they were in the Act and are 
to be of the same effect as if contained in the Act, and are to be 
judicially noticed for all purposes of construction or obligation.” 
 
 
In view of the above, the same principles that are 
followed for the construction of statutes are used to interpret the 
Rules. 
13. 
 
In general, where the law specifies a mode of performing 
a duty, it must be performed in that particular manner or not at all. 
This canon stems from the maxim expressio unius est exclusio 
alterius. However, the question arises as to whether failure to follow 
the prescribed procedure renders the entire action or proceedings 
invalid. There is no principle of universal application to classify a 

Crl. Misc. No.17013/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
provision as mandatory or directory. It depends upon the intent of the 
Legislature rather than the phraseology used. Maxwell writes: 
“It is impossible to lay down any general rule for determining 
whether a provision is imperative or directory. ‘No universal rule’, 
said Lord Campbell L.C., ‘can be laid down for the construction of 
statutes as to whether mandatory enactments shall be considered 
directory only or obligatory with an implied nullification for 
disobedience. It is the duty of court of justice to try to get at the 
real intention of the Legislature by carefully attending to the whole 
scope of the statute to be construed’. And Lord Penzance said:  
‘I believe, so far as any rule is concerned, you cannot safely go 
further than that in each case you must look to the subject-matter, 
consider the importance of the provision that has been disregarded, 
and the relation of that provision to the general object intended to 
be secured by the Act; and upon a review of the case in that aspect 
decide whether the matter is what is called imperative or only 
directory.”3 
14. 
 
Ordinarily, the words “shall” or “must” show that the 
Legislature intended to make the provision mandatory. In contrast, the 
word “may” would indicate that it wanted to make it directory. 
However, they are often used interchangeably. In Province of Punjab, 
and others v. Murree Brewery Company Limited and another (2021 
SCMR 305), the Supreme Court of Pakistan approvingly cited May 
George v. Special Tehsildar and others,4 which laid down the 
following non-exhaustive guidelines for determining whether a 
provision is mandatory or directory: 
“a) 
While determining whether a provision is mandatory or 
directory … the court has to examine the context in which 
the provision is used and the purpose it seeks to achieve; 
b) 
To find out the intent of the Legislature, it may also be 
necessary to examine serious general inconveniences or 
injustices which may be caused to persons affected by the 
application of such provision; 
c) 
Whether the provisions are enabling the State to do some 
things and/or whether they prescribe the methodology or 
formalities for doing certain things; 
d) 
As a factor to determine legislative intent, the court may 
also consider, inter alia, the nature and design of the statute 
and then which would flow from construing it, one way or 
the other; 
e) 
It is also permissible to examine the impact of other 
provisions in the same statute and the consequence of non-
compliance with such provisions;

4 (2010) 13 SCC 98 

Crl. Misc. No.17013/B/2023

f) 
Phraseology of the provisions is not by itself a 
determinative factor. The use of the words ‘shall’ or ‘may’, 
respectively, would ordinarily indicate imperative or 
directory character, but not always; 
g) 
The test to be applied is whether non-compliance with the 
provision would render the entire proceedings invalid or 
not; 
h) 
The court has to give due weightage to whether the 
interpretation intended to be given by the court would 
further the purpose of law or if this purpose could be 
defeated by terming it mandatory or otherwise.” 
15. 
 
In Province of Punjab through Conservator of Forest, 
Faisalabad, and others v. Javed Iqbal (2021 SCMR 328), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the Legislature’s intent, not the 
language used to express that intent, determines whether a particular 
provision is directory or mandatory. To unravel that intention, the 
court should consider the provision’s object and purpose, the 
consequences of construing it one way or the other, and whether its 
non-compliance creates inconvenience or injustice. The Supreme 
Court stated: 
“There are three fundamental tests, which are often applied with 
remarkable success in the determination of this question. They are 
based on considerations of the scope and object, sometimes called 
the scheme and purpose, of the enactment in question, on 
considerations of justice and balance of convenience and on a 
consideration of the nature of the particular provision, namely, 
whether it affects the performance of a public duty or relates to a 
right, privilege or power in the former case the enactment is 
generally directory, in the latter mandatory.”  
16. 
 
In The State, through Regional Director ANF v. Imam 
Bakhsh and others (2018 SCMR 2039), the Supreme Court stated 
that some rules are vital and go to the heart of the subject and 
therefore cannot be broken; others are only directory and a breach of 
them can be overlooked if there is substantial compliance. Some 
sections of a statute may be mandatory while others may be directory. 
It is also possible that a certain portion of a provision, obligating 
something to be done, is mandatory in nature whilst another part of 
the same provision is directory due to the guiding legislative intent 
behind it. Even parts of a single provision or rule may be mandatory 
or directory. In each case, the court must look to the subject matter 
and consider the importance of the provision disregarded and the 

Crl. Misc. No.17013/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
 
relation of that provision to the general object intended to be secured. 
The Supreme Court approvingly cited Crawford who states that “as a 
general rule, [those provisions that] relate to the essence of the thing 
to be performed or to matters of substance, are mandatory, and those 
which do not relate to the essence and whose compliance is merely of 
convenience rather than of substance, are directory.” 
17. 
 
I have already mentioned that the objective of the PFA 
Act is to protect public health. To this end, it provides for food safety 
and food standards and establishes a comprehensive enforcement 
mechanism. Sampling and credible laboratory analysis are pivotal in 
realizing the objective and purpose of the PFA Act. Therefore, section 
21 of the Act empowers the Food Authority to establish a food 
laboratory or recognize or accredit one. Part VII of the Food Rules 
provides for appointing a Public Analyst, outlines his duties and deals 
with other ancillary matters.  
18. 
 
Rule 52 of the Food Rules of 2011 lists food items and 
prescribes the minimum quantity required for preparing a sample in 
each case. There is a statutory presumption that the specified amount 
is the minimum requirement for an authentic Public Analyst’s report. 
Since the prosecution of several offences under Chapter IV of the 
PFA Act depends on that report, I hold that Rule 52 is mandatory. 
Any other conclusion will not only prejudice an accused at the trial 
but also defeat his right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 10-A of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
19. 
 
In the present case, the FSO did not send the requisite 
quantity of milk sample to the Public Analyst, which should have 
been at least 250 ml per Rule 52. Therefore, the report dated 
10.1.2023 is open to a serious challenge. This makes the Petitioner’s 
case one of further inquiry within the meaning of section 497(2) 
Cr.P.C. 
20. 
 
The offence under section 22(1) of the PFA Act with 
which the Petitioner has been charged does not fall within the 
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. In Tariq Bashir and others 

Crl. Misc. No.17013/B/2023

v. The State (PLD 1995 SC 34), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held 
that in such cases, the grant of bail is a rule, and refusal is an 
exception. This principle was reaffirmed in Muhammad Tanveer v. 
The State and another (PLD 2017 SC 733), Arslan Masih and others 
v. The State and others (2019 SCMR 1152), Abdul Saboor v. The 
State and another (2022 SCMR 592), Nazir Ahmad alias Bhaga v. 
The State and others (2022 SCMR 1467), and Muhammad Nawaz 
alias Karo v. The State (2023 SCMR 734). There are no exceptional 
circumstances to withhold bail in the instant case. 
21. 
 
Lastly, the Petitioner has been behind bars since 
27.2.2023. The police do not require him for further probe. His 
continued incarceration would not advance the prosecution’s case. 
22. 
 
In view of the above, I accepted this application vide 
short order of even date and admitted the Petitioner to post-arrest bail 
subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/- 
(Rupees two hundred thousand) with one surety in the like amount to 
the satisfaction of the trial court.
