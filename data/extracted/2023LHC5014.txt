  This criminal revision has been directed 
against the order dated 26.07.2021 passed by learned 
Sessions Judge, Layyah during the trial in case FIR 
bearing No.246 dated 28.05.2020 registered under 
sections 302/337A(i)/337L(2)/148/149 PPC at police 
station Chowk Azam, District Layyah, whereby 
permission was declined to cross examine Dr. Haseeb 
ur Rehman PW-06 to the effect that he has also 
conducted medico-legal examination of four accused 
persons. 
 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that 
when he was cross examining Dr. Haseeb ur Rehman 
PW-06, he sought permission from learned trial Court 
to ‘examine’ him on the fact that he has also 
conducted medico-legal examination of 04 accused 
persons 
and 
relevant 
Medico-legal 
certificates 
(MLCs) along with Radiologist report were also 
available on the record but he was restricted by the 
intervention of learned Assistant District Public 
Prosecutor assisted by the complainant’ counsel, and 
learned trial Court by virtue of order dated 26.07.2021 

 
 
 
 
Crl. Rev. No.206 of 2021                                                                2 
 
has held that such questions cannot be asked because 
prosecution has withheld the fact of injuries to 04 
accused persons, therefore, under the law no question 
out of the scope of examination-in-chief can be asked 
which must be limited within that four corners; finally 
it was declared that defence is at liberty to produce 
MLCs of above referred 04 accused persons and this 
medical officer in their defence as required under 
section 340 (2) or 342 of Cr.P.C. 
3.    Learned Counsel for the complainant supported 
the impugned order while arguing that request of 
defence for examination of witness was misconceived 
being illegal because during cross examination, no 
pocket of examination-in-chief can be created. 
Whereas Learned Deputy Prosecutor General stated 
that request of learned defence counsel was given a 
wrong colour to construe it as examination-in-chief 
otherwise he wanted to ask question during such cross 
examination about a fact from the author of such 
medicolegal certificates and no bar exists to ask such 
questions in the format of cross examination because 
defence is always obliged to put its case, that can 
legally be done during cross examination and only 
then to prove the existence of such fact, MLCs and 
Radiologist report can be tendered in defence 
evidence.  
4. Proponents were heard; legal provisions were 
examined. 
 
5.   What would be the legal position when defence 
counsel during cross examination asks questions from 
a witness about a fact which is not part of 
examination-in-chief, should it be allowed in the 
format of cross-examination. In order to search the 

 
 
 
 
Crl. Rev. No.206 of 2021                                                                3 
 
reply to query, it is necessary to see firstly the 
prevailing principles governing cross examination, its 
scope in law and limitation.  
          There are four broad objectives; each cross 
examination must have at least one of these as its aim. 
They are; 1 
(a) 
 Laying the foundation 
(b) 
 Putting your case 
(c) 
 Eliciting extra and useful facts 
(d) 
 Discrediting the evidence 
 
 
The aim of cross examination is to advance the case of 
accused and to undermine the case of prosecution. In 
order to achieve this aim, it is the cardinal rule that 
while cross examining the witness on a fact, defence 
must put his case there and then in the form of 
questions about related facts in the knowledge of 
defence, though concealed by the prosecution or not 
part of examination-in-chief, otherwise it would be 
regarded as later invention to label it as concocted or 
afterthought. Undermining the prosecution case means 
‘limiting the testimony and discrediting it’ whereas 
advancing the case of defence means ‘eliciting 
favourable testimony and developing the case of 
defence’. 2  
 
6.   These two principles find their place in Articles 
139, 140, 141, 151 & 152 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984. Article 139, 140, 141 and 151 deal with 
discrediting the prosecution case, whereas Article 152 
a deviation to general rule relates to advancing the 
case of defence which is reproduced for reference;

152. Questions lending to corroborate evidence of 
relevant fact admissible: When a witness whom it is 
intended to corroborate gives evidence of any relevant fact, 
he may be questioned as to any other circumstances which 
he observed at or near to the time or place at which such 
relevant fact occurred if the Court is of opinion that such 
circumstances, if proved, would corroborate the testimony 
of the witness as to the relevant fact which he testifies.  
 
Illustrations A, an accomplice, gives an account of robbery in which he 
took part He describes various incidents unconnected with the robbery 
which occurred on his way to and from the place where it was 
committed.  
 
Independent evidence of these facts may be given in order to 
corroborate his evidence as to the robbery itself. 
 
Although the import of Article proves in favour of 
granting such permission while conducting examination-
in-chief but there is no explicit bar to permit such 
explanatory 
questions 
in 
cross 
examination. 
Corroboration, in order to be of any value, must be on 
material particulars and the facts relied on for 
corroboration must be established by reliable and 
independent evidence. These facts must be such as to lend 
assurance to the crucial issue which is in question. Case 
decided by Madhya Pradesh High Court, reported as “Smt. 
Sarla Devi W/O Dwarkaprasad vs Birendrasingh S/O Beni Singh 
And ...” (AIR 1961 MP 127), is referred. In a case reported as 
“Paramban Mammadu And Ors. vs Unknown” (AIR 1951 Mad 
737), it has been held   
“If there is evidence that an assailant has received any 
injury on some particular part of his person & a 
corresponding injury is found on the body of the suspected 
person shortly after the offence is committed, & there is 
medical evidence that that injury was probably caused at or 
about the time when the offence was committed, the 
evidence of the injury would be strong corroborative 
evidence against that person.”   
 
7.   In the light of above referred provision and case 
laws, defence counsel must have been allowed to ask 
such questions from the medical officer during the 
cross examination and defence counsel can refer 
MLCs and radiologist report for asking question while 
showing it to the witness for the purpose of refreshing 
the memory as mentioned in Article 155 of Qanun-e-

 
 
 
 
Crl. Rev. No.206 of 2021                                                                5 
 
Shahadat Order, 1984 and such witness can also be 
testified for the facts mentioned in such MLCs and 
Radiologist report, whereas prosecution has also right 
to cross examine such witness to this aspect while 
seeking permission from the court pursuant to Article 
150 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984; however, 
during cross examination such documents can simply 
be referred, and could only be tendered in evidence at 
a stage mentioned in section 265(7) Cr.P.C. which is 
reproduced for reference: 
265-F. Evidence for prosecution:  
(7) If the accused, or any one of several accused, after 
entering on his defence, applies to the Court to issue any 
process for compelling the attendance of any witness for 
examination or the production of any document or other 
thing, the Court shall issue such process unless it considers 
that the application is made for the purpose of vexation or 
delay or defeating the ends of Justice such ground shall be 
recorded by the Court in writing.   
  (emphasis supplied) 
 
8.   Coming to the question that in what manner a 
witness can refresh his memory about any fact and he 
be testified thereafter accordingly, the Articles 155 & 
156 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 are reproduced: 
155. 
Refreshing memory. (1) A witness may, while 
under examination, refresh his memory by referring to any 
writing made by himself at the time of the transaction 
concerning which he is questioned, or so soon afterwards 
that the Court considers it likely that the transaction was at 
that time fresh in his memory. 
 
   (2)  The witness may also refer to any such 
writing made by any other person, and read by the witness 
within the time aforesaid, if when he read it he know it to 
be correct. 
 
   (3) Whenever a witness may refresh his memory 
by reference to any document, he may, with the permission 
of the Court, refer to a copy of such document: 
 
       Provided the Court be satisfied that there is 
sufficient reason for the non-production of the original.  
 
156. 
Testimony to facts stated in document mentioned 
in Art. 155.—A witness may also testify to facts 
mentioned in any such document as is mentioned in Art. 
155, although he has no specific re-collection of the facts 
themselves, if he is sure that the facts were correctly 
recorded in the document.” 
 
 

 
 
 
 
Crl. Rev. No.206 of 2021                                                                6 
 
Thus, as per Article 155(1) medical officer can see the 
MLCs and as per Article 155(2) also the Radiologist 
report in the same fashion to refresh his memory for 
responding to the questions put by the defence. After 
refreshing the memory, medical officer can be 
testified for relevant facts connected with the 
circumstances including date, time and place of such 
medico-legal examination. 
  
9.   With the fore-cited observation, it is safely 
concluded and held that medical officer shall be 
summoned again as PW-6, whereupon defence 
counsel be allowed to cross examine him with respect 
to facts relating to medico-legal examination of four 
accused persons including other relevant facts, and 
pursuant to Article 150 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984, if the prosecution seeks permission to ask any 
question from said medical officer, court can allow or 
withhold the permission as the situation arises and 
after close of prosecution evidence, the defence can 
tender such MLCs and Radiologist report in his 
defence evidence. This criminal revision, therefore, is 
allowed in such terms as held above.
