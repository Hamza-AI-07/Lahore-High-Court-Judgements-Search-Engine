2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial court, the 
appellants-Abid Ali, Tariq Ali, and Muhammad Arshad, have assailed their 
conviction and sentence by filing an appeal bearing Crl. Appeal No.79031-J 
of 2019. The learned trial court also referred M.R. No.29 of 2020 (The State 
Vs. Abid Ali) to confirm the death sentence awarded to the appellant-Abid 
Ali, whereas the complainant filed Crl. Appeal No.2384 of 2020 against the 
acquittal of respondents No.2 & 3, namely Muhammad Farooq and 
Muhammad Asif (On the request of learned counsel for the complainant, 
names of respondents No.4 to 6 have been deleted). The complainant, 
dissatisfied with the impugned judgment dated 07.12.2019, also preferred a 
Criminal Revision No.2385 of 2020 to enhance the sentence of respondents 
No.2 & 3, namely, Tariq Ali and Muhammad Arshad. All the matters arising 
from the same judgment of the trial court are being disposed of through a 
single judgment. 
3. 
 
Briefly, the prosecution story as alleged in the private complaint 
(Ex. PF) filed by Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant is that on 
10.02.2018, at about 10:00 a.m, the complainant (PW-1) along with his sons 
namely, Muhammad Yaseen (since dead) and Muhammad Sajid (since dead) 
went to tube-well for irrigation of land. After returning from the tube well to 
their cattle shed, when they reached the graveyard on the eastern side of the 
way, the accused persons, while quipped with their respective weapons, were 
ambushed having common objects. On seeing the complainant party, the 
accused, Muhammad Asif, raised a lalkara that no one should have been 
spared, after which the accused, Abid, with his rifle, made a shot, which hit

the right side of the chest of Muhammad Yaseen (since dead), who fell. After 
that, the accused, Tariq Ali, with his rifle, made a shot at the person of Sajid 
(since dead), which landed on the left side of his chest. After that, the 
accused, Arshad, with his rifle, went near Sajid (since dead) and made a shot, 
which hit his left arm. After the alleged occurrence, the accused persons fled 
away from the place of occurrence, whereas Sajid (since dead) succumbed to 
the injuries at the spot. Muhammad Yaseen son of Zafer Ali and Muhammad 
Sadiq son of Ahmad Din were plowing the fields along with the complainant 
and his sons, i.e., Muhammad Sajid, whereas Muhammad Ilyas came there to 
lend agricultural tools. They witnessed the occurrence. Thereafter, the 
complainant (PW-1), while leaving Yaseen and Sadiq, prosecution witnesses 
at the spot, shifted his injured son, namely, Muhammad Yasin, in injured 
condition to the DHQ hospital, where the doctor verified his death. The 
motive behind the occurrence was that the accused persons had a dispute over 
the possession of the tube well.  
4. 
 
After the occurrence, the complainant (PW-1) went to the police 
station, Khudian, and moved an application for registration of case (Ex. PA), 
upon which formal FIR (Ex.PA/1) was chalked out by Sher Muhammad, ASI 
(CW-7). After registration of the case, the investigation of this case was first 
entrusted to Tahir Sohail, Ex. S.I (CW-8). After that, the investigation of this 
case was entrusted to Qurban Shabbir, (Retired) S.I (CW-5), who found the 
accused persons/appellants guilty, prepared a report under Section 173, 
Cr.P.C. while placing the names of the accused in column No.3 of the Challan 
and sent the same to the court of competent jurisdiction. The learned trial 
court formally charge-sheeted the appellants on 11.09.2018, to which they 
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The complainant, in support of his 
version, produced as many as three (03) witnesses, whereas the rest of the 
witnesses were summoned as court witnesses, i.e., CW.1 to CW.10. 
5. 
 
 After the closure of prosecution evidence, the appellants were 
also examined in terms of Section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein they refused to 
appear as their own witnesses in terms of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. However,

they opted to produce defence evidence. In response to a particular question 
of why this case was against them and why the PWs deposed against them, 
the appellants, No.1 & 2, Abid Ali and Tariq Ali, made the following 
deposition: - 
“The factum has been came on record during 
cross examination that SHO had gone to the 
place of occurrence in response to the emergency 
call on 10.02.2018 at 10:02 a.m and on at 10:18 
a.m on 15-rescue which was made by a person 
who impersonated himself as Sardar Sajid and 
Haji Akbar whereas complainant has vehemently 
denied that he has not made any, despite the fact 
that Afzal Moharrar CW-2 has stated that SHO 
had visited the place of occurrence along with 
Incharge of Homicide cell reached at the place of 
occurrence in response of call of rescue 15. It is 
stated that on 10.02.2018 at about 11:00 a.m, 
complainant Akbar Ali along with 2-3 persons 
came along with Yaseen deceased in the police 
station and they remained present for many 
hours and issued the docket for injuries. The 
above said facts were not brought on surface by 
the I.O in league with the complainant and the 
complainant was adamant to deny these hard 
facts and the FIR was not got registered by the 
complainant and after 07/08 hours a fabricated 
and false version was advanced on the legal 
advise to implicate our family. Actually, the real 
man Khalil son of Arif, son in law of Akbar 
complainant, who had the venom and grudge 
because he wants to wreak the vengeance against 
me, my brother Abid and my relative Arshad etc 
due to the reason, Arshad was married with 
sister of Khalil surreptitiously. When this 
marriage came into the knowledge of Khalil, he 
murdered her sister and Yaseen deceased 
informed Arshad that his wife has been 
murdered by Khalil etc in the house of Yaseen 
PW-2 in Tehsil Pattoki.” 
While replying to a particular question of why this case was against him and 
why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant, No.3, Muhammad Arshad, 
made the following deposition: -

“The case is totally false. In fact I have 
contracted marriage with Aqsa Bibi daughter of 
Arif and sister of Khalil Ahmad son in law of 
complainant Haji Akbar at the time of Nikah, 
Tariq my co-accused was the witness in the said 
Nikah and the case registered by me for the 
murder of my wife Aqsa Bibi, I arrayed as 
accused. Haji Baqar S/o Khan Bahadur real 
brother of Muhammad Nawaz PW-3, along with 
Arif Father, Umar, Khalil sons of Arif s/o Jalal 
Din who are the father and brothers of Aqsa 
Bibi. Haji Muhammad the younger brother of 
Muhammad Yasin PW-2was also inimical 
towards as the fictitious Nikah-Nama was 
prepared with Aqsa Bibi my wife without taking 
divorce from me and I filed petition u/s 22-A, 22-
B Cr.P.C against Haji Muhammad And Zulfiqar 
Ali real brothers of Muhammad Yasin PW-2. We 
have cordial relation with Sajid and Yasin 
deceased. I and my brother can not think about 
the murder of the said persons who were closely 
related to us. In fact Khalil Ahmad son in law of 
complainant have suspicion that Yasin deceased 
gave our family information to me and above 
said Khalil Ahmad son in law of complainant 
who is generalist and influential personality in 
Islamabad and he managed the murder of his 
brother in laws Sajid and Yasin deceased 
through hired criminals. Sajid deceased made a 
telephone on rescue 15 at 10:02 AM on the 
alleged day of occurrence i.e. 10.02.2018 that two 
persons are quarrelling with me and on the same 
date at 10:17 am a telephonic call was made from 
the mobile phone of Yasin deceased by 
complainant Muhammad Akbar that three/four 
persons quarreled with his sons. At 10;45 a.m on 
10-02-2018 Muhammad Yasin then injured was 
brought to the P.S, a docket was prepared and 
Muhammad Yasin injured was sent to RHC 
Khudian from where he was referred to DHQ 
hospital, Kasur, this fact was not ever brought by 
the complainant before the I.O, during the 
course 
of 
investigation. 
There 
is 
glaring 
contradictions 
between 
the 
statements 
application of the complainant Ex.PA and 
complaint Ex.PF of the complainant and PWs 
which are fatal to the prosecution case.”

 After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence available 
on record, considering arguments advanced by both sides, the learned trial 
court found the prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable 
doubt, which resulted in the appellant's conviction as well as awarding of 
sentence to them in the afore-stated terms. 
7. 
 
 We have carefully considered both sides’ rival submissions and 
minutely reviewed the evidence on record. 
8. 
 
As per the prosecution version, in the instant case, the incident 
took place on 10.02.2018 at 10:00 a.m. in Saidpur, falling within the 
territorial jurisdiction of Police Station Khudian, District Kasur, wherein 
Muhammad Yasin and Sajid (sons of Haji Akbar Ali-the complainant) lost 
their lives. The inter-se distance between the place of occurrence and the 
police station was 10 kilometers. Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant 
reported the incident to the police on the same day at 05:00 p.m. through the 
written application (Ex. PA), based on which Sher Muhammad, A.S.I. (CW-
7) chalked out the FIR (Ex. PA/1). There was an inordinate delay of 07 hours 
in reporting the matter. Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed 
during examination-in-chief that soon after the incident, he took his son 
(Yasin) to the hospital for medical treatment to save his life. He (PW-1)-the 
complainant, deposed during his examination-in-chief that: - 
“My son Sajjid Ali succumbed to the injury at the 
spot, whereas I alongwith other persons shifted 
Yasin in injured condition at District Headquarter 
Hospital, Kasur, while leaving Sadiq and Yasin at 
the guard of place of occurrence. When I shifted 
my son Yasin at Hospital, the Doctors available in 
emergency declared him as dead.” 
Whereas, during cross-examination, Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, 
deposed that: - 
“I escorted my son Muhammad Yaseen to hospital 
according to my version in FIR accompanied with 
my son in law while boarding on a rented vehicle. I 
have not produced the driver of rented vehicle. I 
came to know about the death of my son at the

hospital where after checking in emergency doctor 
informed me about the death of my son Yaseen. I 
have no knowledge about any prescription/entry in 
the emergency of DHQ hospital, Kasur. I have no 
knowledge about any issuance of death certificate 
of my deceased son Yaseen. I took my son in 
emergency of DHQ hospital in between 03:30 pm 
to 04:00 p.m. ----------------- It is correct that we 
reached DHQ hospital via Deepalpur road. We 
adopted the passage for reaching DHQ hospital, 
Kasur through Bhagiana. If one adopts the road 
via Bhagiana which lead to Khudian and then 
Kasur. The P.S Khudian is situated at 5/7 acres 
from the main road.” 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant further deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“The constable took me and my injured son to 
RHC Khudian. The RHC Khudian referred the 
injured Yaseen due to his precarious condition to 
DHQ hospital, Kasur. I escorted my injured son 
alongwith 
my 
other 
companion 
at 
about 
10:30/11:00 am from the place of occurrence. We 
remained at P.S Khudian 11:00 am to 12:00 noon. 
Yaseen injured remained outside the gate of the 
police station. It is correct that the detail regarding 
the escorting Yaseen the then injured to P.S 
Khudian and then to RHC Khudian are not 
mentioned in the FIR. It is correct that the details 
regarding escorting the Yaseen then inured to P.S 
Khudian, the factum of apprising the Moonchi, 
sending constable alongwith the injured and then 
taking the injured to RHC Khudian are not 
mentioned in private complaint. It is correct that 
Moonchi is also called Moharar. --------------------- 
After the occurrence the car driver of the rented 
car came alongwith the rented vehicle. Thereafter 
Khalil also came there after hearing about the 
occurrence alongwith other persons. It was not in 
my knowledge that till the occurrence that Khalil 
has arrived back from Islamabad. Prior to the 
occurrence Khalil did not come to my house. I 
escorted my injured son Yaseen to P.S Khudian 
and the person who learned about the occurrence 
followed me to P.S Khudian, perhaps 3/4 cars 
reached there. Khalil also came at the police

station when I shifted Yaseen in the police station 
at P.S Khudian. It is correct that Khalil my son in 
law is related with me with Yaseen injured and 
was 
also 
educated. 
-------------------------- 
We 
escorted the injured Yaseen for the hospital 
around 10:30 to 11:00 am on a rented car. We 
were accompanied with Khalil who is also my son 
in law. We have choosen the road leading 
Bhagiana to Kasur through Khudian. We firstly 
went to P.S Khudian. It took half an hour to reach 
P.S. Khudian. We did not meet SHO there. We 
informed Moharar and made over him whole story 
of the occurrence, who had written or not my 
narrations is not known to me. Probably he would 
have written something but I cannot say anything 
about it. He after hearing the whole story sent a 
constable alongwith us for taking the injured to 
hospital. It is correct that we went to RHC 
Khudian. On seeing the critical condition doctor 
referred us to DHQ hospital, Kasur. He referred 
the patient in writing but did not give us any 
writing in this regard. Nobody else accompanied us 
in the car to take the injured to hospital. 
Volunteered that later on people joined us. ---------- 
Some people followed us out of which some met us 
at police station to inquire about the occurrence 
from us, and some joined us at RHC Khudian. 
Half of the village almost came to inquire.” 
Sher Muhammad A.S.I. (CW-7) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“It is correct that on dated 10.02.2018 at about 
11:00 am complainant Akbar Ali alongwith 2/3 
persons which are not known to me came 
alongwith Yaseen alleged deceased in the police 
station. Volunteer stated that they remained 
present in police station for many hours and I.O 
issued them docket for the injuries. I do not know 
if Yaseen had already died before reaching police 
station. Soon after the registration of the case, the 
FIR complainant and his companion left the police 
station.” 
 
 
According to the deposition of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the 
complainant, he took his son Yasin (then injured) to the police station after 
the incident at about 10:30 or 11:00, and he remained in the police station 
from 11:00 to 12:00 noon. After that, he took Yasin (then injured) to the RHC

Khudian. At the RHC Khudian, the doctor referred Yasin to the DHQ 
Hospital, Kasur, due to his critical condition. He reached the emergency of 
DHQ hospital between 03:30 pm and 04:00 p.m. The doctor checked him in 
the emergency of the hospital and declared that his son had died. Dr. Ch. 
Arslan Ahmad PGR (CW-1), who conducted the postmortem examination on 
the dead body of Muhammad Yaseen (the deceased), deposed during 
examination-in-chief that the duration between injury and death was within 
30 minutes. From the testimony of Sher Muhammad A.S.I. (CW-7), it reveals 
that Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, remained in the police station 
for hours. As per the version of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-complainant, keeping 
in view the critical condition of Yaseen (then injured), the doctor of RHC 
Khudian referred Yaseen (then injured) to DHQ, hospital Kasur and the 
complainant reached DHQ Hospital, Kasur at “Zohar time.” Haji Akbar Ali 
(PW-1)-the complainant further deposed during cross-examination that:  
“We reached at DHQ hospital, Kasur after 
Zohar time.” 
Zohar (Dhuhr) timing on 10.02.2018 was 11:52 a.m., whereas “Asr” timing 
was 04:06 p.m. At the cost of repetition, Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the 
complainant, deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Yaseen injured remained outside the gate of 
the police station.”  
Whereas Tahir Suhail Ex. S.I. (CW-8), after perusal of the Roznamacha 
deposed during the cross-examination conducted by the complainant's counsel 
that: - 
“It is correct that Rapat No.8 dated 10.02.2018 
recorded by Riasat Ali TASI at 10:45 am to the 
effect that Yasin s/o Akbar Ali Dogar r/o Said 
Pura in injured condition came at police station 
and after preparation of docket he was sent to 
RHC, Khudian in the company of Muhammad 
Yasin 378/C and he also recorded that after the 
receipt of MLC whatever will be the situation 
the proceeding will be conducted.”

Tahir Suhail Ex. S.I. (CW-8), deposed during the cross-examination 
conducted by the complainant's counsel that: - 
“I have not received the docket of Yasin the 
then injured which was prepared as mentioned 
vide Rapat No.8 dated 10.02.2018. Regarding 
the said docket no information was provided to 
me as the FIR was silent about the above said 
fact, 
therefore 
I 
did 
not 
conduct 
any 
investigation regarding the above said fact.” 
The postmortem report (Ex. PR) of Muhammad Yaseen, deceased, has not 
been challenged by the prosecution, wherein it was mentioned that the 
duration between injury and death was half an hour. Dr. Ch. Arslan Ahmad 
(CW-1) deposed during examination-in-chief that: -  
“On 10.02.2018 I was posted as Medical Officer 
at DHQ Hospital Kasur. On the same date at 
9:00 p.m I conducted autopsy on the dead body 
of deceased Muhammad Yaseen, aged about 
31/35 years, caste Dogar, r/o Saidpur District 
Kasur. ----------------- Duration between injury 
and death was within 30 minutes and between 
death and post mortem was within 12 hours.” 
Tahir Suhail Ex. S.I. (CW-8)-the investigating officer also deposed during the 
cross-examination that: - 
“I have not received the docket of Yasin the 
then injured which was prepared as mentioned 
vide Rapat No.8 dated 10.02.2018. Regarding 
the said docket no information was provided to 
me as the FIR was silent about the above said 
fact, 
therefore 
I 
did 
not 
conduct 
any 
investigation regarding the above said fact.” 
 
 
Admittedly, the prosecution witnesses failed to prove when and 
where Yaseen (then injured) took his last breath. The episode between 10:00 
a.m. and 05:00 p.m. on 10.02.2018 is shrouded under mysterious 
circumstances that are not appealing to reason and logic. If the complainant, 
alongwith prosecution witnesses and Yaseen (then injured), reached DHQ 
Hospital, Kasur, at Zohar time and as per the opinion of the doctor, the 

M.R No.29 of 2020,

11
duration between the injury and death was 30 minutes, then how the doctor 
could refer Yasin (then injured) from RHC Khudian to DHQ hospital, Kasur. 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, in his cross-examination, deposed 
that he has no knowledge of any prescription/entry in the emergency of DHQ 
hospital, Kasur, and about any issuance of the death certificate of his 
deceased son Yaseen. Medical evidence contradicts the ocular account. 
Medical evidence shows that Yasin (then injured) was alive for half an hour. 
If we consider the time of the incident in the light of the medical evidence and 
see when Yasin (then injured) took his last breath, it is at 10:30 a.m. because, 
according to the prosecution, the time of the incident is 10:00 in the morning. 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant stated that between 10:30 and 11:00 
a.m., he escorted Yasin, to the hospital in the rented car. When the 
complainant took Yasin (then injured) to the hospital, as per the medical 
evidence, he was already dead. That is why the complainant did not produce 
the RHC doctor as a witness, nor did he present the doctor of DHQ Hospital 
Kasur as a witness. The prosecution has not produced a refer slip of RHC 
Khudian or a death certificate issued by DHQ Hospital, Kasur, during 
evidence. The non-submission of documents, i.e., the refer slip and the death 
certificate, creates doubt about the prosecution's case, as a man may lie, but 
the document cannot. The prosecution failed to prove what the complainant 
and his witnesses did for seven hours, which put a dent in the prosecution's 
story. 
9. 
 
The prosecution put much emphasis on the evidence of the Haji 
Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, and Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye 
witness, on the point the deceased Sajid Ali made that call on 15 before his 
death at 10:02 a.m. on 10.02.2018 and complainant made the call on 15 at 
10:18 a.m. on 10.02.2018 and referred to a copy of call data rescue 15 Kasur 
to prove that incident against the appellants was reported by Sajid Ali 
deceased in his life is concerned, we have noted that as per prosecution case 
on receiving firearm injury Sajid Ali succumbed to the injuries at the spot. It 
is not the case of the prosecution that any attraction occurred between the

deceased and the accused before the incident. A scanned copy of call data 
rescue 15 Kasur is as follows: -  
 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“My son Yaseen in injured condition made a 
telephonic call on 15 at about 10:30 am where 
he was fallen at the place of occurrence near the 
graveyard. The police did not came at the place 
of occurrence after receiving the call from 
Yaseen the then injured.” 
Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“My cell number is 0321-7072603. The cell 
number of Yaseen deceased is 0301-7988783.” 
Tahir Suhail Ex. S.I. (CW-8)-the investigating officer during cross-
examination conducted by the complainant counsel deposed that: - 
“It is correct that on 16.02.2018 I while 
mentioning sixteen mobile numbers I requested 
that the call detail of those sixteen numbers will 
be obtained and due to that affect the 
application was moved. The call details was not 
received by me during my posting and 
investigation. I have not explained in my

proceedings that who was the user of the 
mentioned mobile phone numbers. It is correct 
that at No.9 the cell number of Yasin deceased 
i.e. 0301-7988783 is mentioned. It was not  
brought into my notice that deceased Yasin 
made call from his mobile at 15 at 10.02.2018. It 
is correct that according to the Roznamcha 
there is no mention of receiving any call made 
at rescue 15 and there is also no mention that 
any police officer responded to the said call and 
went to the place of occurrence.” 
Tahir Suhail Ex. S.I. (CW-8)-the investigating officer during cross-
examination conducted by the defence counsel deposed that: - 
“It is correct that complainant Akbar Ali and 
Sadiq, Ilyas, Yasin PWs and even Yasin did not 
apprise me about the call on rescue 15. It is also 
correct that complainant Akbar Ali in his 
application for registration of case and also in 
the FIR did not mention about the call made on 
rescue 15. ---------------------- It is correct that as 
per PMR No.10/2018 of Yaseen deceased the 
duration between injury and death was within 
30 minutes.” 
 
 
The caller did not give the accused's name in the call on 15. It 
has also been argued that Sajid Ali (deceased) did not make a call. In support 
of their submission, the learned counsel for the appellants referred to the 
evidence of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, Muhammad Yaseen 
(PW-2)-the eye witness, Muhammad Amjad Ali 51/HC (CW-4), and Tahir 
Suhail Ex. S.I. (CW-8)-the investigating officer. Tahir Suhail Ex. S.I. (CW-
8)-the investigating officer said that the dead body of Sajid Ali (deceased) lay 
at the place of occurrence till 05:00 p.m., and after that, the dead body was 
sent to the mortuary. Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during 
examination-in-chief that: - 
“My son Sajjid Ali succumbed to the injury at 
the spot, whereas, I alongwith other persons 
shifted Yasin in injured condition at District 
Headquarter Hospital, Kasur, while leaving 
Sadiq and Yasin at the guard of place of 
occurrence. When I shifted my son Yasin at

Hospital, the Doctors available in emergency 
declared him as dead.” 
In similar lines, Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness deposed. Haji 
Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“My son Sajid when fell down on the ground his 
head was towards the north whereas his foot 
was towards south. I administered water to 
Yaseen and also lifted him whereas Sajid 
succumbed to the injuries at the spot. My 
clothes were not smeared with blood when I 
lifted injured Yaseen.” 
Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“The police arrived at the place of occurrence 
at about 05:00 pm. ---------------- The dead body 
was escorted on a Dala which was fetched by 
the police and shifted the dead body to the 
hospital.” 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, also deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“It is correct that I and Khalil my son in law 
boarded Yaseen in injured condition in the car. 
Our clothes were not smeared with blood. It is 
correct that bloods was oozing out from the 
body of injured Yaseen which also caused his 
clothes smeared with blood. It is correct that 
seat of car where injured Yaseen was sitting 
also smeared with blood. Since I was sitting on 
front seat, therefore, my clothes were not 
smeared with blood. Might be clothes of Khalil 
smeared with blood as injured Yaseen was in 
the lap of Khalil.” 
Contrary to the deposition of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, 
Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness, deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“Our hands severed with blood of injured but 
not the clothes. We showed our blood stained

hands to the IO when IO came at the spot. 
When I Sadiq and Ilyas put the injured on the 
rear seat of the car his head was in the lap of 
Haji Akbar complainant.” 
Muhammad Amjad Ali 51/HC (CW-4) deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“It is correct that on 10.02.2018 I alongwith 
Tahir Suhail S.I, Muhammad Serwar ASI and 
Muhammad Imran HC reached at place of 
occurrence at 5:00pm. ------------ At place of 
occurrence dead body of deceased Sajid was 
lying there. ---------- We reached at DHQ, 
Hospital, Kasur at 7:00pm. It is correct that at 
that time dead body of deceased Yasin brother 
of deceased Sajid was also in mortuary.” 
Tahir Suhail Ex. S.I. (CW-8)-the investigating officer during examination-in-
chief that: - 
“On 10.02.2018 I was posted as Incharge 
Homicide Investigation Unit P.S Khudian, 
Kasur. On the same day investigation of this 
case was entrusted to me. I alongwith 
Muhammad Sarwar ASI, Ajmad Ali 51/HC, 
Muhammad Imran 1293/HC and Muhammad 
Asif constable reached at place of occurrence 
where dead body of Sajid deceased was lying 
and I inspected the dead body in the presence of 
22 individuals.” 
Tahir Suhail Ex. S.I. (CW-8)-the investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“The delay before the registration of the FIR 
was caused due to complainant. It is correct 
that FIR was registered with delay of seven 
hours. FIR was handed over to me outside the 
police station at about 05:10 p.m. I proceeded to 
the place of occurrence on official vehicle.” 
It is admitted fact that Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, Muhammad 
Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness, Muhammad Amjad Ali 51/HC (CW-4), and 
Tahir Suhail Ex. S.I. (CW-8)-the investigating officer deposed that the 
investigating officer arrived at the place of occurrence after 05:00 p.m. and 
after that, the dead body of Sajid Ali (deceased) was sent to the mortuary after

about seven hours from the time of occurrence. A substantial period had 
lapsed between the incident and sending the dead body from the spot to the 
mortuary. Dr. Ch. Arslan Ahmad (CW-1), who conducted a postmortem 
examination upon the dead body of Yaseen, deposed during cross-
examination conducted by the learned counsel for the complainant that: - 
“It is correct that according to application for 
registration of the case, inquest report and the 
FIR which bear my signatures, the time of 
occurrence is 10:00 a.m on 10.02.2018. -----------
------ Prior to conducting autopsy I have read 
the said documents. It is correct that according 
to inquest report, which was prepared when the 
dead body was in the dead house. Time of 
receiving the dead body in the dead house is 
recorded as 11:15 a.m whereas the relevant 
papers were received at 7:35 p.m and I 
conducted postmortem examination at 9:00 p.m 
on the same day i.e. 10.2.2018. I have mentioned 
the time of death as 10:00 a.m. in the PMR 
ExPR approximately.” 
Dr. Ch. Arslan Ahmad (CW-1) deposed during cross-examination conducted 
by the defence counsel that: - 
“It is correct that time of death of deceased 
Yaseen mentioned in ExPR as 10:00 a.m is my 
independent assessment. We mentioned the 
time of death by keeping in view the condition 
of the body regarding developing of rigor 
mortis and also while taking information from 
the police official. It is correct that in between 
the time of 11:15 a.m when dead body was 
received upto 7:35 p.m I did not receive the 
relevant police papers. After studying the 
documents, I started to conduct autopsy at 9:00 
p.m. According to inquest report the inquest 
was held by the I.O in the hospital upon the 
dead body of Yaseen.” 
Dr. Muhammad Waqas Umer (CW-9), who conducted postmortem 
examination upon the dead body of Sajid Ali, deposed during cross-
examination conducted by the learned counsel for the complainant that: - 

M.R No.29 of 2020, 
Crl. Appeal No.79031-J of 2019 
Crl.Appeal No.2384 of 2020 &

“According to the police information time and 
death of Sajid deceased was 10:00 am dated 
10.02.2018. Time of dead body receiving in dead 
house was 07:00 pm dated 10.02.2018 and 
receiving complete documents form police at 
07:00 pm on 10.02.2018 and conducting autopsy 
at 10:30 pm approximately.” 
As deposed by Dr. Ch. Arslan Ahmad (CW-1) and Dr. Muhammad Waqas 
Umer (CW-9), Sajid Ali died at 10:00 a.m., the prosecution failed to prove 
who made the call on 15, and if the dead body of Yaseen was received in the 
dead house at 11:15 a.m., then the entire prosecution story becomes doubtful. 
Thus, the presence of these witnesses, i.e., Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the 
complainant, Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness at the time of 
occurrence, becomes doubtful.  
10. 
 
As per the contents of the application for the registration of case 
(Ex. PA) and FIR (Ex. PA/1), there was a dispute over water between the 
parties. However, while filing the private complaint (Ex. PF) on 30.06.2018, 
after 04-months and 20 days, the motive was improved, and the complainant 
mentioned that there was a dispute over the tube well between the 
complainant and the accused party. Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“The land was in my name. It is correct that 
while describing the motive of the occurrence I 
have not specifically named any accused 
regarding rift on the water. It is correct that the 
details of the motive is not mentioned in the 
FIR.” 
The defence has brought on record the contradictions in the evidence of Haji 
Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant. Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I might have got recorded in my application 
Ex.PA that the accused persons wanted to get 
possession of the water motor. Confronted with 
Ex.PA where it is not so recorded.”

Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant admitted during cross-examination 
that he had not pointed out the place where the motor was installed and the 
land was being irrigated by the tube well. The relevant portion of the cross-
examination is as follows: - 
“As the motor was situated at the distance of 3 
acre from the place of occurrence, therefore, 
the same was not pointed out to the draftsman. 
I have not pointed out the specific land which 
was being irrigated by the tubewell according to 
our version. Volunteered that the site plan was 
prepared with regard to place of occurrence. I 
have pointed out the land which was being 
cultivation. I have pointed out the place where 
the tractor was present.” 
Whereas Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“As there was no previous enmity between the 
parties therefore I did not record any previous 
enmity between the parties in my statement 
before police.” 
He (PW-2) also deposed during the cross-examination that: - 
“The way leading to the tubewell of Haji Akbar 
complainant is a thorough-fare.” 
 
 
The incident occurred on the thoroughfare. The deceased and the 
complainant were returning after irrigating the field and going towards their 
cattle shed. Meanwhile, Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2) was busy ploughing the 
land with the tractor. According to the prosecution case, the witnesses were 
returning from their tube well to their cattle shed. The incident occurred when 
they reached the graveyard on their way to the cattle shed. According to the 
appellants, the prosecution witnesses had a strained relationship between 
them. The appellants, Tariq and Abid, have admitted that their mother had 
filed a civil suit, and a copy of the plaint titled Hameedan Bibi versus Akbar 
Ali (Ex. PB) was filed on 04.05.2018 regarding that tube well. Haji Akbar Ali 
(PW-1)-the complainant stated that the connection of the Tube-well was

installed 20 years ago, and the connection was in the name of Bashir Ahmad. 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination 
that: -  
“My father Rehmat Ali had two brothers one 
was Bashir and the other was Akbar Ali who 
was died in my childhood. It is correct that 
Pervaiz is son of my paternal uncle Bashir and 
the accused persons namely Tariq and Abid are 
sons of said Pervaiz. It is correct that accused 
persons namely Arshad, Farooq and Asif are 
sons of daughter of Bashir my paternal uncle. 
Pervaiz s/o Bashir died in the year 2009. -------- 
It is not in my knowledge that Tariq own how 
much land. Tubewell connection was in the 
name of Bashir initially.  It is correct that land 
of accused persons namely Abid and Tariq is 
situated adjacent to my land. My land is also 
cultivated by kanal water. My turn of water 
start at 01:05 pm on each Tuesday. ” 
The deposition of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, reveals that 
tubewell connection, was initially installed in the name of “Bashir,” who was 
the paternal uncle of the complainant. Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant 
had mentioned in the written statement (Ex. PC) that he and his uncle Bashir 
both had been jointly using the tube well in equal shares since about 1995, 
and both have had it, for which Haji Bashir Ahmed executed a written 
agreement on 22.08.2007. Later, in early 2018, Haji Bashir Ahmed received 
the expenses of his 50 percent share from Akbar Ali and assigned its 
ownership entirely to Haji Akbar. Haji Akbar had not submitted any written 
agreement about the purchase of the remaining 50 percent share. He only 
submitted an affidavit of Haji Bashir Ahmed (Ex. PD), according to which his 
son Parvez died a long time ago, and his sons do not have any concern with 
the tube well. This affidavit was written on 10 May 2018, and based on the 
affidavit, the civil court declared the suit infructuous, vide order dated 
07.06.2018, while Haji Bashir Ahmed did not appear and verify the contents 
of the affidavit (Ex. PD). Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed 
during cross-examination that: -

“It is correct that land of Pervaiz and my land 
were irrigated from the electric tubewell before 
the occurrence which was in the name of Bashir 
at that time. Bashir my paternal was alive 
during the presence occurrence. Said Bashir 
died 2/3 months back from today. I do not 
remember the date when said Bashir died. I 
cannot assign any reason for not remembering 
the date of death of Bashir.” 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination 
that: -  
“It is correct that in the civil suit filed by Mst. 
Hameedan Bibi the version of said Hameedan 
Bibi was that the tubewell connection was in the 
name of Bashir Ahmad his father in law. 
Witness volunteer said Bashir was my paternal 
uncle. Said Bashir was paternal grandfather of 
accused Tariq and Abid whereas he was 
maternal grandfather of accused Arshad, 
Farooq and Muhammad Asif.  
The deposition of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, reveals that the 
land of Pervaiz and his land were irrigated from the tube well before the 
occurrence. Pervaiz was the father of the appellants Tariq and Abid. Haji 
Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed that the accused were the paternal 
and maternal grandchildren of Haji Bashir Ahmad. The incident occurred on 
10.02.2018. Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed that earlier in 
the year (2018), he purchased a 50% share in the tube well from Bashir but 
did not say when he purchased it, and the same is not mentioned in Bashir's 
affidavit. Both parties admitted that Bashir's son and daughter's children are 
accused in this case. In such circumstances, Bashir's appearance before the 
court was necessary to verify the affidavit's contents (Ex. PD). Keeping in 
view the deposition of the complainant (PW-1) it reveals that after the 
occurrence Haji Bashir Ahmad sold his share. The depositions of the 
prosecution witnesses, i.e., Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, and 
Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2), revealed that the dispute was over the water for 
irrigation through tube-well water. Before the occurrence, both Pervaiz's (late 
father of appellants Abid and Tariq) and the complainant's lands were

irrigated by the same tubewell. Before the occurrence, both Pervaiz's (late 
father of appellants Abid and Tariq) and the complainant's lands were 
irrigated by the same tubewell. The tube well was installed on the way, a 
thoroughfare leading east to west.   
This takes us to the oral evidence of eyewitnesses. The 
eyewitnesses were related to the deceased, and therefore, it was submitted that 
they were interested and chance witnesses. The term "interested" postulates 
that the witness must have some direct interest in having the accused 
convicted somehow or other due to some animus or other reason. An 
interested witness is interested in securing the conviction of a person out of 
vengeance or enmity. The origin of the incident was shrouded in mystery as 
the complainant admitted that the tubewell irrigated both lands before the 
occurrence. So, irrigating land with tubewell water was not a motive for the 
commission of the crime. In the present case, the only circumstances which, 
at best, could be said to have been proved by the prosecution and the defence 
are enmity between the parties on account of criminal litigation. Haji Akbar 
Ali (PW-1)-the complainant and Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2), admitted during 
cross-examination that Muhammad Arshad got registered a case vide FIR No. 
126 (Ex. PV), dated 08.03.2017, under sections 302 and 34 PPC against the 
Khalil son of Arif, son-in-law of the complainant (PW-1). Haji Akbar Ali 
(PW-1)-the complainant admitted during cross-examination that:-  
“Khalil s/o Arif who is my son in law. It is 
correct that Khalil and Sadiq PW are first 
cousin. ------------- My son in law Khalil had 
studied at Islamabad for 10/12 years and now a 
days he doing job in the same city. -----------------
I do not know how many days prior to the 
occurrence Khalil my son in law came from 
Islamabad. After the occurrence the car driver 
of the rented car came alongwith the rented 
vehicle. Thereafter Khalil also came there after 
hearing about the occurrence alongwith other 
persons. It was not in my knowledge that till the 
occurrence that Khalil has arrived back from 
Islamabad. Prior to the occurrence Khalil did 
not come to my house. I escorted my injured

son Yaseen to P.S Khudian and the person who 
learnt about the occurrence followed me to P.S 
Khudian, perhaps ¾ cars reached there. Khalil 
also came at the police station when I shifted 
Yaseen in the police station at P.S Khudian. It is 
correct that Khalil my son in law is related with 
me with Yaseen injured and was also educated. 
It is correct that FIR No.126/2017 was got 
recorded at the instance of Muhammad Arshad 
accused on 08.03.2017 at P.S City Chunian. -----
------ According to the version of Arshad, he got 
married with Aqsa daughter of Muhammad 
Arif on 15.05.2016 against the wishes of the 
parents of Aqsa. According to the said FIR the 
version of Arshad was that on 01.03.2017 the 
accused persons took Mst. Aqsa and thereafter 
murdered her. According to said FIR the 
accused persons were Arif, Umer, Khalil s/o 
Arif and Haji Baqar. I do not know whether 
Tariq present accused was the witness of the 
Nikah between Arshad and Aqsa. The witness 
volunteered 
that 
Nikahnama 
is 
a 
fake 
document. I have not seen the Nikahnama. ------
--------- It is not in my knowledge that Farooq 
and Arshad accused of this case took the stand 
in the present case that Yaseen (deceased) 
informed Arshad (accused) son of Bashir that 
Khalil etc. had murdered his wife Aqsa 
whereupon Arshad got registered an FIR 
against Khalil and three others on 08.03.2017.” 
Contrary to the deposition of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, 
Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2), deposed during cross-examination that: -  
“Khalil did not arrive at the place of occurrence 
so long I remained present there. He came at 
the spot on the next day of occurrence. I do not 
remember the time when he went to the place of 
occurrence. The police did not arrive at the 
place of occurrence on the next day of the 
occurrence. My stance that Khalil went to the 
place of occurrence on the next day of the 
occurrence is correct. On the next day I myself 
met Khalil at the place of occurrence as our 
cattle shed is near to the place of occurrence 
and I was present there.”

Muhammad Nawaz (PW-3), the identifier of the dead bodies, and the 
complainant is his brother-in-law (Behnoe), deposed during cross-
examination that: -  
“Khalil was not seen by me on the spot as well 
as in the hospital but however, he met me in the 
morning at 06:00 am on 11.02.2018 in the 
village. I have not inquired from Khalil where 
he was. ---------------We also have not seen 
Khalil in hospital. Khalil met me on the next 
day early in the morning at 06:00am.” 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant and Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2) 
admitted that the crime case was registered against Khalil and his family 
members for murdering Aqsa. Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant 
admitted during cross-examination that: -  
“I have no knowledge whether sister of my son 
in law Khalil namely Aqsa contracted marriage 
Nikah on her own choice with the accused 
Arshad. I have no knowledge whether Khalil 
filed any application for registration of FIR 
against accused Arshad regarding abduction of 
his sister Aqsa. I have no knowledge about 
filing of writ petition u/s 491 Cr.P.C by Arshad 
contending that Khalil detained wife of Arshad 
in his house. -------------------- I have no 
knowledge whether same Aqsa was forcibly 
married with brother of witness Yasin without 
taking the divorce from Arshad accused. I have 
no knowledge about the marriage of Aqsa and 
Haji Muhammad brother of Yasin witness. I 
have no knowledge whether any writ petition 
was filed in the Hon’ble Lahore High court 
Lahore in which a bailiff was appointed to 
recover Aqsa Bibi wife of Arshad accused. I 
have 
no 
knowledge 
whether 
after 
such 
circumstances we concealed Aqsa Bibi in order 
to avoid any further complication. ------------ I 
have no knowledge for filing of another writ 
petition in Hon’ble Lahore High Court Lahore 
subsequently. I had no knowledge whether my 
son Yasin deceased had good relations with the 
accused persons. I have no knowledge whether 
Khalil my son in law had doubts that my

deceased son Yasin used to inform and share 
the secrets of the family with the accused 
persons. ----------------- Arshad might have got 
registered a case FIR No.126/17 P.S City 
Chunian for the murder of Aqsa u/s 302/34 PPC 
against Khalil etc.” 
The complainant replied to the questions about registering a criminal case by 
saying that he did not have “knowledge.” After that, the prosecution placed 
on the record a copy of FIR (Ex. PV) and judgment dated 21.02.2019 (Ex. 
PW) whereby Khalil Ahmad, etc., were acquitted by the trial court after 
accepting an application under Section 265-K Cr.P.C. Muhammad Yaseen 
(PW-2), deposed during cross-examination that: -  
“I know Aqsa Bibi sister of Khalil son in law of 
complainant. She was married with younger 
brother of Haji Muhammad. -------------- My 
brother haji Muhammad is resident of village 
Majra. Arshad accused was not living in village 
Majra. ------------------- It is correct that Arshad 
filed a writ petition in the Honourable Lahore 
High Court, Lahore from where a bailiff was 
deputed to recover Aqsa Bibi. ---------------- 
Arshad accused might have filed second writ 
petition in the Honourable Lahore High Court 
Lahore for recovery of Aqsa Bibi. -------------- It 
is correct that Arshad accused got registered 
case FIR No.126/2017 dated 8.3.2017 u/s 302/34 
PPC at PS City Chunian against Arif, Umar 
brother of Khalil mentioned above, alongwith 
Khalil and Haji Baqar. Volunteered that 
Arshad accused had no proof of any Nikah of 
Aqsa with him. ------------- It is correct that the 
accused persons Arshad, Farooq and Asif were 
declared not involved in this occurrence by the 
I.O.” 
Muhammad Arshad, accused/appellant No.3, produced attested copy of 
Criminal Misc. No. 3404-H-2017 for his wife's recovery, “Aqsa Bibi,” and 
the court proceedings along with the order dated 13.03.2017 (Ex. DB), which 
reveal the court was apprised that “Aqsa Bibi” was murdered. FIR No. 126 
dated 08.03.2017 was registered under Section 302 and 34 PPC at Police 
Station City Chunian, District Kasur (Ex. DD). USB (Ex. DE) and copy of

Nikah-Nama (Mark-DA) show that “Aqsa Bibi” did not die a natural death. 
This fact was admitted by Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2). Muhammad Yaseen 
(PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: -  
“It is correct that FIR was got registered on 
behalf of Arshad accused regarding the alleged 
murder of Aqsa sister of Khalil at P.S City 
Chunian vide FIR No.126/2017 u/s 302/34 PPC 
on 08.03.2017 place of venue mentioned in the 
FIR in village Majra Tehsil Pattoki. The witness 
volunteered that Aqsa was not murdered, she 
was married with my younger brother and due 
to maternity problem she died and a false case 
vide FIR No.126/2017 P.S City Chunian was 
registered. The version of present accused 
Arshad, Farooq and Asif was given to the 
Investigating Officer that Yaseen s/o Akbar 
passed the information regarding the murder of 
Aqsa by the hand of Khalil etc. in the village 
Majra whereupon Arshad got registered the 
said case. The witness volunteered stated that 
according to the medical report of Aqsa she 
died due to electric shock.” 
As is well known, enmity is a double-edged weapon that cuts both ways. If, 
on the one hand, it provided a motive for the accused to commit the 
occurrence in question, on the other hand, it equally provided an opportunity 
for the first informant to implicate his enemy. Proof of motive by itself may 
not be a ground to hold the accused guilty. In this background, the appellants' 
implication in the case is quite probable. Due to the involvement of the 
complainant’s son-in-law in the murder case, it is quite probable for 
prosecution witnesses to implicate the accused in a criminal case. Motive is a 
double-edged weapon for the occurrence and also for false implication. 
Different motives always operate in the mind of the person making the false 
accusation. The accused, based on his motive to commit the crime, cannot by 
itself lead to a judgment of conviction.

The defense has also brought on the record how the prosecution 
witnesses and the deceased returned after irrigating their land. The defence 
has brought on the record contradictions between the contents of the

application for registration of the case (Ex. PA) and the court statement made 
by Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant. Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the 
complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I have got recorded that I alongwith my son were 
going to cattle shed while coming back after 
irrigation from our tubewell. Confronted with 
Ex.PA where it is not so recorded, however, it is 
recorded that I along with my sons had gone to the

application Ex.PA that after sustaining first fire 
my son Sajid fell down on the ground. Confronted

Farooq s/o Bashir Ahmad opened the fire of rifle 
which hit the left arm of Sajid is not recorded.” 
Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“On the same day I.O reached at the place of

possession; I got recorded my statement u/s 161

occurrence and was busy in ploughing the land 
through tractor. Confronted with Ex.DA where the

with Ex. DA where the word placing his rifle is not

coming near to Sajid when he was fallen on the 
ground fired on his left arm.” 
 
 
As per the prosecution version, Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2), 
alongwith Muhammad Sadiq, was ploughing the field of the complainant. 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“I do not remember whether I got recorded in 
Ex.PA that Yaseen and Sajid were ploughing the 
fields but I have do not remember whether I got 
recorded the means of ploughing the fields. I have 
pointed out the tractor with which the Pws were 
ploughing the fields to the I.O. I have not provided 
the title document of the tractor to the I.O. I have 
not mentioned the number, make and ownership of 
the tractor to the I.O. I have apprised the 
draftsman the place of the tractor where the 
witnesses were ploughing the fields. I have also 
pointed out the field to the draftsman. I have not 
produced the tractor before the subsequent 
Investigating officer as none of them directed me

to produce the same. -----------------------I have got 
no tractor of my own. The witness volunteered that 
the tractor was brought by Yaseen PW. -------------  
Neither the I.O summoned the owner of the tractor 
nor we produced him before the I.O. I have not got 
recorded the name of the owner of the tractor in 
complaint. ------------------------The site plan was 
prepared on my pointation and I met draftsman 
and I.O. at that time. -------------------Ilyas had 
come with tractor to fetch the cultivator which was 
present near my boundary wall of Havaili. I have 
pointed out the place of presence of Ilyas PW and 
have not pointed to him regarding the tractor he 
brought. I had not pointed out in the scaled site 
plan hew (Kassi) to the draftsman. I have pointed 
out to the I.O where the hew (Kassi) was fallen. 
Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“It is correct that I do not own any agricultural 
land in village Saidpur, however, they are my 
relatives who reside there. I have been apprising 
the Investigating officer during the investigation 
that I use to reside and has been cultivating the 
land in village Saidpur. It is correct that my 
residence is recorded in village Bhagiana because I 
am permanent resident of village Bhagiana. ------- 
The intervening distance between place of 
occurrence and village Bhagiana is about 1-
Kilometer. ------------------I have pointed out the 
place where I was cultivating the land with the 
tractor. I have not got recorded in my examination 
in chief that who was the driver of the tractor. 
Volunteered that I was driving the tractor. ----------
------------The tractor was present at the same place 
where it was present at the time of occurrence and 
I pointed out the presence of the tractor to the I.O 
when he came at the spot on the day of occurrence. 
I have shown the place where I was cultivating 
with tractor and that was the field towards the 
northern side of the field of one Sher s/o Bashir 
Ahmad. I have pointed out the same place to the 
draftsman.” 
Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness deposed during cross-
examination that: -

“In the investigation of Tahir Sohail I.O only once 
the site plan was prepared by the draftsman. We 
have not got prepared any site plan from Tahir 
Sohail. I.O” 
Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness stated that he was cultivating the 
land with a tractor, which was at the northern side of the fields of one Sher s/o 
Bashir Ahmad and he pointed out the same to the investigating officer as well 
as to the draftsman. On perusal of unscaled site plan (Ex. CW-8/D), it reveals 
that the land of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant falls at the northern 
side of the agricultural land of Sher s/o Bashir Ahmad. Whereas the presence 
of the witnesses, i.e., Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2), Muhammad Sadiq, and 
Ilyas, was shown at point “K,” and on the same point, the land was plowed, 
which is at the southern side of the land of Sher s/o Bashir Ahmad. Whereas 
the land of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, is shown in the site plan 
on the northern side and between the land of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the 
complainant and Sher s/o Bashir Ahmad, there was a passage. The scanned 
copy of the unscaled site plan (Ex. CW-8/D) is as follows: - 
 
In the scaled site plan (Ex. CW-5/1), the passage between the land of Sher s/o 
Bashir Ahmad and the land of the complainant is shown, and on the passage,

the tubewell is shown. The scanned copy of the scaled site plan (Ex. CW-5/1) 
is as follows: - 
 
In the scaled site plan (Ex. CW-5/1), the presence of eye witnesses is shown 
at point “E,” which is on the northern side of the land of the complainant. The 
position of the witnesses has been changed in the scaled site plan (Ex. CW-
5/1) from the southern side to the northern side. On the perusal of the inquest 
report (Ex. CW-8/A), in column No. 24, a map of the place of occurrence has 
been drawn, which reflects the same position shown in the un-scaled site plan. 
The scanned copy of the inquest report (Ex. CW-8/A) is as follows: - 
 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination 
that: -

“It is correct that a path leads towards east 
from the main passage which is 5/6 feet wide in 
between my land and the land of Sher. Wheat 
crop was present in the field of Sher. Yaseen 
was ahead of Sajid.” 
 
 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant and Muhammad Yaseen 
(PW-2)-the eye witness, changed their stance and presence of the witnesses 
on the land, which was plowed before the occurrence by the witnesses to 
strengthen their case. It is the case of the prosecution that due to a dispute of 
water on irrigation, the incident took place. However, only the tube well is 
shown in the passage. However, the agricultural land belonging to the accused 
side has not been shown in the unscaled and scaled site plans. While replying 
to the questions put by the learned counsel for the complainant, Sadiq Ali 
Qamar (CW-6)-draftsman admitted that: - 
“On 15.02.2018 I.O Tahir Sohail called me on 
telephone. I reached at police station in between 
11:00 to 12:00 noon. We reached at the place of 
occurrence approximately at 01:30 pm. On the 
pointation of complainant and PWs and on the 
direction of I.O I took rough notes. Thereafter I 
retained the rough notes alongwith me. It is 
correct that on 25.04.2018 I after preparation I 
presented the site plan to the then I.O. I also 
recorded my statement to the I.O.” 
 
 
There is an admission on the part of Sadiq Ali Qamar (CW-6)-
draftsman, that on the pointing of the complainant and PWs and at the 
direction of the investigating officer, he prepared scaled site plans (Ex. CW-
5/1 & Ex. CW-5/2). Sadiq Ali Qamar (CW-6)-draftsman also deposed during 
cross-examination that: - 
“The whole plan is silent regarding the place which 
was being cultivated with the tractor. It is correct 
that it was shown in the site plan that the land was 
cultivated with the tractor. Had any witness had 
pointed to me I would have shown the cultivated 
land with tractor in the site plan. Neither I had 
seen any cultivated land or vacant land nor the I.O 
had shown to me such land. The presence of 
cultivator of the tractor had not been shown or

stated by any PW to me. ------------------------The 
witnesses had not pointed out/shown to me where 
the witnesses allegedly irrigating the field with the 
tubewell water. The I.O and PWs had not 
informed me from where they were coming and 
where they were going. I had not shown the place 
where the accused persons had ambushed. ---------- 
On patch, no crime empty is mentioned in the site 
plan. ------------------------Delay caused due to two 
factors firstly I was sick and secondly I.O Tahir 
Sohail did not come to receive site plan from me. 
Thereafter Tahir Sohail was transferred and 
Qurban Shabbir received site plan. I did not 
mention number of crime empties and bore at 
point K due to the reason that I.O Tahir Sohail 
had told me that he would give the number and 
bore of crime empties, he has later on, not given 
the above said information to me. Had the 
witnesses and complainant told to me regarding 
the number and bore of the crime empties I would 
have been recorded the same.------It is correct that 
point C mentioned in scaled site plan is totally 
different from point C mentioned in the unscaled 
site plan as the name of Akbar complainant is not 
mentioned at point C in unscaled site plan. It is 
also correct that point D shown the scaled site plan 
is entirely different from point D mentioned in the 
unscaled site plan. It is correct that in point D of 
unscaled site plan name of Ilyas PW is not 
mentioned. It is correct that point E in the scaled 
site plan is altogether is different from point E 
mentioned in unscaled site plan. It is correct that 
names of Yasin and Sadiq PWs are not mentioned 
at point E in unscaled site plan. It is correct that 
points F, G, H and I mentioned in both the site 
plans are similar. Point J mentioned in scaled site 
plan is different from point J mentioned in 
unscaled site plan. It is correct that point K 
mentioned in the scaled site plan is entirely 
different from point K mentioned in the unscaled 
site plan. After giving the rough notes and handed 
over to me rough site plan by the I.O and after 
taking rough notes by me after 3-4 days from 
15.2.2018 Tahir Sohail SI dictated to me about the 
different points changing from unscaled site plan 
according to FIR.”

From the prosecution evidence, it reveals that the scaled site plan 
and unscaled site plan were prepared on the pointing of the prosecution 
witnesses, i.e., Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, and Muhammad 
Yaseen (PW-2), and this fact also got reaffirmed by the learned counsel for 
the complainant while cross-examining Sadiq Ali Qamar (CW-6)-draftsman. 
In both site plans, a significant change was made about the land the witnesses 
ploughed. The substantial change made in the site plan is with purpose. If the 
presence of the witnesses is considered on the land of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-
the complainant on the southern side, then it was not possible for the 
witnesses to witness the occurrence with a specific role, which took place on 
the path, which leads from south to north, as in the unscaled site plan 
(Ex.CW-8/D), point “K” was shown at the south eastern side, away from the 
place of occurrence, where land was ploughed. The unscaled site plan also 
does not demonstrate the complainant's presence. In the scaled site plan (Ex. 
CW-5/1), at point “C,” the complainant's presence has also been shown on the 
path from south to north. The main passage leads from south to north; at point 
“D,” the presence of PW-Ilyas was shown, and at point “E,” the presence of 
Yasin, Zafar and Sadiq PWs was shown, which is on the northeastern side. If 
witnesses are present at considerable distance from the place where deceased 
received injuries by the hands of assailant(s) and grown up crop is intervening 
the places then witnesses’ deposition with specification of roles of assailants 
qua inflicting firearm injuries is not believable; though complainant annexed 
site plan with changed detail of place of occurrence with complaint, yet did 
not negate correctness of site plan annexed with state case as well as Naqsha 
Khasra detailed in Column No.24 of the inquest report during trial of the case, 
hence, changed site plan is of no help to the case of complainant. The change 
of the position of the witnesses is deliberate. As per the scaled site plan (Ex. 
CW-5/1) and the statement of Sadiq Ali Qamar (CW-6), a draftsman, there 
was a wheat crop adjacent to the main passage on the northeastern side, and if 
witnesses were present on the eastern side, then; in the presence of wheat 
crop, it was not possible to see the incident with the specification. Sadiq Ali 
Qamar (CW-6)-draftsman deposed during cross-examination that: -

“All the points of site plan were pointed out to me 
by the complainant and witnesses and the same is 
written therein. Tahir Sohail SI got dictated me all 
the points on the pointation of complainant and 
PWs. At point K, number of crime empties and 
bore is not mentioned and about this, none of the 
PWs had pointed to me. It is correct that one main 
passage leads from north to south and one 
shortage links the same path and leads towards 
eastern side. The short passage is leading towards 
east and towards the southern side from it, wheat 
crop is shown which is also adjacent to the main 
passage. There was crops alongwith the main path 
towards eastern side of the path. There was no 
vacant field towards the eastern side of the main 
path.” 
 
 
The prosecution has failed to establish which land was irrigated 
by the accused side. Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during 
cross-examination that: - 
“I have got recorded regarding the rift of the water 
with the accused persons in the FIR. Perhaps I 
might have recorded in the contents of FIR the 
date of dispute over water issue.” 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant also deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“I have got recorded that I alongwith my son were 
going to cattle shed while coming back after 
irrigation from our tubewell. Confronted with 
Ex.PA where it is not so recorded, however, it is 
recorded that I alongwith my sons had gone to the 
tubewell for irrigation the crops. I have got 
recorded in my application Ex.PA that when we 
reached near the graveyard situated near to our 
cattle shed. Confronted with Ex.PA whether the 
word near to our cattle shed is not recorded. I have 
pointed out my cattle shed to the I.O as well as 
draftsman. ---------------- I have got recorded in 
application Ex.PA that accused persons were 
ambushed alongwith the wall of graveyard. 
Confronted with Ex.PA where the word ambushed 
and wall are not recorded. I have pointed out the 
specific place alongwith the wall of graveyard

where the accused were ambushed to the I.O and 
to the draftsman. ---------------- I have not pointed 
out the specific land which was being irrigated by 
the tubewell according to our version. Volunteered 
that the site plan was prepared with regard to 
place of occurrence. I have pointed out the land 
which was being cultivation. I have pointed out the 
place where the tractor was present. --------------
Graveyard comprises of 15/16 acres of land and on 
which 4/5 tree are present. One bamboo plant is 
present on the corner of land of Sher.” 
 
 
Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant filed a private complaint 
(Ex. PF) after four months and twenty days on the ground that his presence 
was not shown in the unscaled site plan. The complainant's counsel did not 
ask any questions from Tahir Suhail S.I. (CW-8)-the Investigating Officer, 
during the cross-examination about the unscaled site plan (Ex. CW-8/D) that 
he had made, nor did he ask any questions about the sketch made by him (the 
Investigating Officer) in column No. 24 of the inquest Report (Ex. CW8/A). 
The complainant claims that his presence was not mentioned in the unscaled 
site plan (Ex. CW-8/D), and Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2) deposed that he did 
not get prepared site plan from the Investigating Officer about the crime 
scene. One of the reasons for filing a private complaint was that the 
Investigating Officer did not show the presence of the complainant in the 
unscaled site plan (Ex. CW-8/D), but in this regard, he was not asked any 
questions, which indicates that the unscaled site plan (Ex. CW-8/D) was 
correct. The relevant portion of the cross-examination of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-
1)-the complainant, is as under: - 
“I have complained about the factum of non 
mentioning me as eye witness in the rough site 
plan before the S.P.” 
But during cross-examination, Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant 
admitted that: - 
“Graveyard comprised of 15/16 acres of land 
and on which 4/5 tree are present. One bamboo 
plant is present on the corner of land of Sher.”

By admitting the presence of a bamboo plant in the corner of the 
land of Sher, Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant admitted the unscaled 
site plan (Ex. CW-8/D). A bamboo plant was shown in the unscaled site plan 
(Ex. CW-8/D) but not in the scaled site plan (Ex. CW-5/1). All the above 
facts create doubt about the presence of the witnesses at the place of 
occurrence. The mode and way the appellants and co-accused caused the 
injuries mentioned in the written application for registration of a case (Ex. 
PA) and private complaint (Ex. PF) and in the depositions of the prosecution 
witnesses are changed to bring the ocular account in line with the medical 
evidence.  
12. 
 
At the cost of repetition, Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2), the 
eyewitness, deposed during cross-examination, where he resided at Saidpur. 
For CNIC, his address has been mentioned as “Bhagiana.” Whereas Haji 
Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Yasin PW was not a cultivator he had come there 
for plowing my fields at the time of occurrence. I 
myself called Yasin for plowing the fields from 
Bhagiana. I had no knowledge about any Khasra 
Gardawri of the cultivation of Yasin in his village 
Bhagiana. Volunteer that he is owner of one/two 
acres in that village. It is correct that he is resident 
of village Bhagiana. Volunteer that his brought up 
was done in this village Bhagiana.” 
 
 
Admittedly, Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2) is a chance witness, and 
conflict between the statements of Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, 
and Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness, creates doubt about the 
presence of Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2) at the place of occurrence at the time 
of occurrence.  
13. 
 
There is another aspect of the case that also makes the 
prosecution's case doubtful. Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant deposed 
during examination in chief that: - 
“While leaving dead body at DHQ, Hospital, 
Kasur, I went to Police station Khudian where I

37
submitted application for registration of FIR 
Ex.PA duly thumb marked by me.” 
Whereas, during cross-examination, Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant, 
deposed that: - 
“I myself got drafted application for registration of 
FIR from the computer which was available at the 
police station. It is not in my knowledge that 
whether the said application was drafted any 
Hawaldar or operator, however, he was in uniform 
in the 
police station. The application for 
registration of FIR was drafted on computer at 
about 05:00 pm. I did not sustain any injury. I 
have not learnt by heart the FIR. ----------------------
One Moonchi was sitting in the police station at 
that time. It is correct that I informed him that my 
son has been murdered. At that time I did not 
submit any application or thumb mark the 
application. I did not apprised him the details of 
the occurrence as we were rushing towards the 
hospital for the treatment of injured Yaseen. The 
Moonchi sent a constable alongwith the injured, 
the Moonchi might have jotted down some paper. 
The name of the constable who accompanied the 
injured is not remember to me. ------------------------- 
I got written application Ex.PA in P.S. Khudian 
which was computer generated. Same was 
composed by a police official. I cannot tell the 
designation of that police official. I cannot 
distinguish between the ranks of ASI, S.I, 
Inspector and constable. It was 05:00 pm when 
Ex.PA was got composed. It is correct that there is 
a delay of duration of seven hours in preparation 
of Ex.PA. Volunteer since my son was injured as 
the delay was caused.” 
 
 
The prosecution failed to explain the delay in reporting the 
incident and what the complainant did for 07 hours. This aspect of the matter 
is sufficient to cast doubt about the authenticity of the F.I.R. This creates 
serious doubt about the genuineness of the prosecution story, including the 
complainant's presence at the scene of the occurrence. Delays in lodging the 
FIR often result in embellishment, a creature of an afterthought.

As far as recovery of the weapon of offence, i.e., rifle 223-bore 
(P-9) alongwith three live bullets (P-10/1-3) on the pointing of Abid Ali (the

appellant No.1), on 30.03.2018 and rifle 7-mm (P-11) on the pointing of Tariq 
Ali (the appellant No.2), on 04.04.2018 and positive report of Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency (Ex. PT/1-2) is concerned, as per the prosecution case, on 
20.03.2018, the appellants, Abid Ali and Tariq Ali were arrested. Upon the 
disclosure of the appellant-Abid Ali, on 30.03.2018, rifle 223-bore (P-9) 
along with three live bullets (P-10/1-3) were recovered by Tahir Sohail, Ex-
S.I. (CW-8)-the investigating officer who secured the same into possession 
through a recovery memo (Ex. PM). On 04.04.2018, Tariq Ali (appellant 
No.2) got recovered a 7-mm rifle (P-11), which Tahir Sohail, Ex-SI, (CW-8)-
the investigating officer secured through recovery memo (Ex. PO). Both the 
recovery memos were attested by Muhammad Nawaz (PW-3) and 
Muhammad Sadiq. Tahir Sohail Ex-S.I. (CW-8)-the investigating officer 
deposed during examination in chief that: - 
“On 20.03.2018 I arrested accused Abid and Tariq 
and recorded their versions. -------------------On 
30.03.2018 I interrogated accused Tariq and Abid 
and accused Abid made disclosure that he could 
recover weapon of offence. I alongwith other police 
officials and accused Abid reached at village 
Saidpur near the house of accused Abid where 
Sadiq and Muhammad Nawaz met us and joined 
me in their presence the accused repeated the 
disclosure about the recovery of weapon of offence. 
After that accused Abid led us to his house and 
entered in his residence room and got recovered 
rifle P9 alongwith three live bullets P10/1-3 from 
the iron box which was lying with eastern wall of 
the room and made it into a sealed parcel and took 
the same into possession vide recovery memo 
Ex.PN attested by PWs. --------------------------On 
return to police station I handed over case 
property to the Moharar and locked the accused in 
police lockup.”  
 
 
As per prosecution evidence, Tahir Sohail Ex-S.I. (CW-8)-the 
investigating officer handed the recovered weapons to Muhammad Afzal 
1027/C (CW-2) on 30.03.2018. Whereas Muhammad Afzal 1027/C (CW-2)-
Moharrar deposed during examination in chief that: - 

M.R No.29 of 2020, 
Crl. Appeal No.79031-J of 2019 
Crl.Appeal No.2384 of 2020 & 
Crl.Revision No.2385 of 2020

“On 04.04.2018 Tahir Suhail S.I handed over to 
me two parcels of Rifle. On 12.04.2018, I handed 
over the said parcel to Muhammad Serwar ASI for 
depositing the same in the office of PFSA, Lahore.”  
 
 
As per the Firearms & Toolmarks Examination Report (Ex. 
PT/1-2), the weapon recovered from the appellant-Abid Ali, matched the 
crime empties concerned; the prosecution was bound to prove safe custody of 
the sealed parcels of the recovered rifle 223-bore (P-9) along with three live 
bullets (P-10/1-3) from the appellant-Abid Ali, on 30.03.2018. After 
scrutinizing the material on the record, we concluded that the prosecution had 
not established safe custody of the recovered rifle 223-bore (P-9), along with 
three live bullets (P-10/1-3). There are contradictions in the case of the 
prosecution as to the safe custody of the parcels of the recovered rifle 223-
bore (P-9), along with three live bullets (P-10/1-3). Muhammad Afzal 1027/C 
(CW-2)-moharrar has deposed that the rifle 223-bore (P-9), along with three 
live bullets (P-10/1-3), were handed over to him on 30.03.2018 rather than 
handed over to him on 04.04.2018. The testimony of Muhammad Afzal 
1027/C (CW-2)-moharrar is crucial. Tahir Sohail Ex-S.I. (CW-8)-the 
investigating officer deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“On return to police station I handed over case 
property to the Moharar and locked the 
accused in police lockup.” 
Muhammad Afzal 1027/C (CW-2)-moharrar, deposed during cross-
examination that: -  
“On 04.04.2018 Tahir Suhail S.I handed over to 
me two parcels of Rifle. On 12.04.2018 I handed 
over the said parcel to Muhammad Serwar ASI 
for depositing the same in the office of PFSA, 
Lahore.” 
 
 
It is not merely a minor lapse, but there is a very strong suspicion 
about the entire prosecution story. The Firearms & Toolmarks Examination 
Report (Ex. PT/1-2) reveals that the rifle 223-bore (P-9) submitted on 
12.04.2018 matched the crime empties submitted on 23.02.2018. In the facts 
and circumstances mentioned above, the possibility of tempering the 

M.R No.29 of 2020,

recovered rifle 223-bore (P-9) cannot be ruled out. The prosecution must 
prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and suspicion cannot replace proof. 
There are too many shortcomings in the prosecution's evidence. The court 
must examine the evidence from the starting point and reach a reasoned 
conclusion, considering the legal principles. The prosecution failed to 
establish that the rifle 223-bore (P-9), along with three live bullets (P-10/1-3), 
was kept in safe custody. We believe the inconsistencies and contradictions, 
considered cumulatively, lead to irresistible influence, and the prosecution has 
not been able to prove safe custody of the recovered rifle 223-bore (P-9) 
through material and cogent evidence. This lapse on the prosecution's part 
went to the case's root. Besides, Haji Akbar Ali (PW-1)-the complainant 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Tariq and Abid were arrested after the 5/7 days 
of the occurrence. Again said perhaps they had 
been arrested after 10 days of the occurrence.” 
Muhammad Yaseen (PW-2)-the eye witness deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“After about 15 days I had seen the accused 
persons in the police lock up.” 
 
 
As per the prosecution version, the occurrence took place on 
10.02.2018, and if both the appellants were taken into custody by the 
investigating officer after 10/15 days of the occurrence, it becomes 
20/25.02.2018, which creates doubt about the entire proceedings of the 
recoveries of weapons of offence. So, the positive report of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PT/1-2) is of no consequence to the 
prosecution.  
15. 
 
 From the above-detailed discussion, we are convinced that the 
prosecution has failed to establish its case. The truth was seen buried under 
the debris, and a different story was structured perhaps to lug the appellants 
into trial under the serious offense. It is often said “that Fouler the crime 
higher the decree of proof.” We have gone through the process of keen 
examination of the entire material and found compelling reasons, as stated 

M.R No.29 of 2020,

above, to disagree with the conclusion recorded by the learned Additional 
Sessions Judge also found that the prosecution had miserably failed to prove 
the guilt of the accused/appellants beyond reasonable doubt. Per the dictates 
of the law, the benefit of every doubt is to be extended in favor of the 
accused. In the case of “Muhammad Akram v. The State” (2009 SCMR 
230), it is held as under: - 
“The nutshell of the whole discussion is that the 
prosecution case is not free from doubt. It is an 
axiomatic principle of law that in case of doubt, the 
benefit thereof must accrue in favour of the 
accused as matter of right and not of grace. It was 
observed by this Court in the case of Tariq Pervez 
v. The State 1995 SCMR 1345 that for giving the 
benefit of doubt, it was not necessary that there 
should be many circumstances creating doubts. If 
a circumstance created reasonable doubt in a 
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then 
the accused would be entitled to the benefit of the 
doubt not as a matter of grace and concession but 
as a matter of right.”. 
16. 
 
We, therefore, accept in toto Criminal Appeal No.79031-J of 
2019 filed by the appellants, Abid Ali, Tariq Ali, and Muhammad Arshad; 
as a result, whereof conviction and sentence recorded by the trial court vide 
judgment dated 07.12.2019 is set aside and the appellants-Abid Ali, Tariq Ali 
and Muhammad Arshad are acquitted of the charge in a private complaint 
filed under sections 302, 201, 109, 148, 149 PPC P.S. Khudian, District Kasur 
titled “Haji Akbar Ali Vs. Abid Ali, etc.”. The appellants-Abid Ali, Tariq Ali 
and Muhammad Arshad, are ordered to be released forthwith, if not required 
in any other case. Murder Reference No.29 of 2020, forwarded by the trial 
court for confirmation of the death sentence inflicted upon the convict Abid 
Ali, fails, which is answered in NEGNATIVE. 
17. 
 
So far as Criminal Revision No.2385 of 2020 filed by the 
complainant, Haji Akbar Ali, for enhancement of conviction and sentence of 
the respondent Nos.2 & 3 awarded by the trial court is concerned, for the 
reasons aforestated, the same is devoid of any legal force, which is 
accordingly dismissed. 

M.R No.29 of 2020,

Crl.Revision No.2385 of 2020

18. 
 
So far as CRIMINAL APPEAL No.2384 of 2020 seeking the 
conviction of respondents Nos.2 & 3, namely Muhammad Farooq and 
Muhammad Asif, is concerned, for what has been discussed above in the light 
of prosecution, medical, and documentary evidence, the acquittal of 
respondents Nos.2 & 3 does not suffer from any illegality to call for our 
interference with the impugned judgment to their extent. We have also taken 
note of the settled principle of criminal jurisprudence, which states that unless 
it can be shown that the lower court’s judgment is perverse or that it is 
entirely illegal, No other conclusion can be drawn except the guilt of the 
accused or misreading or non-reading of evidence resulting in a miscarriage 
of justice. Even otherwise, when a court of competent jurisdiction acquits the 
accused, the double presumption of innocence is attached to their case.  The 
acquittal order cannot be interfered with, whereby a charge earns double 
presumption of innocence as held in Muhammad Mansha Kausar v. 
Muhammad Ashgar and others (2003 SCMR 477).  In this case, the 
prosecution has not been able to bring on record adequate incriminating 
evidence against respondents Nos.2 & 3, which connects them with the 
alleged crime. The learned trial Judge has advanced valid and plausible 
reasons for recording acquittal in favor of respondents Nos.2 & 3. The 
judgment of acquittal does not call for any interference. Consequently, we 
find no merit in this Criminal Appeal bearing No.2384 of 2020, which is, as 
a result of this, dismissed as being without prices.
