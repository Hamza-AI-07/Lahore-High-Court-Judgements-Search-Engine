Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:- This Intra Court Appeal 
under Section 3 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 is directed 
against the order dated 04.03.2022 passed by the learned Single 
Judge whereby Writ Petition No.72701/2017 filed by respondent 
was allowed. 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that the respondent filed a 
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and contended that the respondent 
applied for the post of Assistant Superintendent Jail (BS-16) in 
response to advertisement No.41/2017 published by the Punjab 
Public Service Commission, he appeared in competitive exam 
and stood at 13th position among successful candidates. 
Subsequently, the appointment letters were issued to the 
successful candidates but the respondent was denied appointment 
on the ground that his eyesight was not as per eligibility criteria. 
The respondent filed a representation which was rejected by 
Date of hearing  :  23.01.2023

appellant No.2 vide order dated 21.06.2017. The respondent 
challenged the validity of order dated 21.06.2017 as well as Rule 
1042(C) of Pakistan Prisons Rules, 1978 through Writ Petition 
[No.72701/2017] which was allowed by the learned Single Judge 
vide order dated 04.03.2022. Hence, this appeal. 
3. 
We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the 
appellants and have gone through the record with her able 
assistance.  
4. 
The appellants through advertisement No.41/2017 invited 
applications for the post of Assistant Superintendent Jail (BS-16) 
with the following criteria:  
“i.  Bachelor Degree (2nd Division) from recognized university, and 
ii.   Physical Standards: 
 
Height  
173 CM 
 
Chest   
85 CM without expansion and 
  
 
 
90 CM with expansion 
 
Vision  
Right 6/6 without glasses 
 
 
 
Left 6/6 without glasses.”   
 
The respondent applied for the said post, qualified the written test 
and after completion of legal formalities, the PPSC announced 
the result and the respondent stood at Sr. No.13 but the 
appointment letter of the respondent was not issued on the ground 
that his eyesight was not up to the requisite standard i.e. 6x6 
without glasses. The respondent filed representation to the 
Additional Chief Secretary (Home), Government of the Punjab 
on 18.04.2017 which was rejected on 21.06.2017.  
5.  
It is important to note here that in the paragraph No.8 of 
the writ petition, the respondent challenged the said order dated 
21.06.2017 being void ab-initio but in the prayer clause, instead 
of requesting for setting aside of the said order, he prayed as 
under: 
 “Keeping in view above mentioned facts it is respectfully prayed 
Rule 1042(C) of Pakistan Prisons Rules (Annex-K) prescribing 
vision “without glasses” may be declared ultra vires of the 
constitution. Respondent No.2 may be directed to issue offer of 
appointment letter to the petitioner as he fulfills all other conditions 
of appointment as such.”

The respondent, after acceptance of the terms and conditions of 
the advertisement, filed an application for the post but he could 
not fulfill the required eligibility criteria. The respondent 
appeared before the Medical Board, Services Hospital, Lahore 
and the said Medical Board issued certificate on 08.02.2017 
which shows the eyesight of the respondent as 6x6 with glasses. 
The said medical examination was conducted as required under 
the Punjab Prisons Service Rules, 2010. Under Rule 1042(c) of 
the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978 the vision of both eyes of a 
candidate must be 6x6 without glasses but as per report of 
Medical Board, the respondent lacks the requisite standard of 
vision. The respondent has not challenged the findings of the 
Medical Board but has prayed for setting aside the aforesaid Rule 
[1042(C)] through the constitutional petition which amounts to 
admission on his part regarding the findings and it is settled law 
that admitted facts need not to be proved. Reliance is placed on 
the cases of Mst. Nur Jehan Begum through LRs v. Syed Mujtaba 
Ali Naqvi (1991 SCMR 2300) and Mst. Rehmat and others Vs. 
Mst. Zubaida Begum and others (2021 SCMR 1534).  
Furthermore, Rules 602, 604, 1045 and 1047 Pakistan Prison 
Rules, 1978 deal with the nature and duties of an Assistant 
Superintendent Jail for which the vision of a candidate must be 
upto the best level, as settled by the department. Under Rule 21 
of the Punjab Civil Servants (Appointment & Conditions of 
Service) Rules, 1974 a candidate must fulfill the prescribed 
criteria and if a candidate does not meet the physical and mental 
requirements as prescribed by the government, he shall not be 
appointed. Moreover, Rule 74(3) of the United Nations Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners obliges 
government/authority to adopt suitability and physical standards 
for the recruitment of the Prison Staff and the Rule 1042(C) is 

 
I.C.A. No.31531/2022

clearly in consonance thereof. When law prescribes anything to 
be done in a particular manner, it is to be done as mandated by 
law. In this regard, reliance may respectfully be placed on the 
case titled as Government of the Punjab, Food Department 
through Secretary Food & Another Vs. Messrs United Sugar 
Mills Limited & Another (2008 SCMR 1148). 
6.  
The learned Single Judge while allowing the constitutional 
petition has held that the Rule 1042(C) of the Pakistan Prison 
Rules, 1978 is ultra vires of Article 18 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 [hereinafter referred to as 
“Constitution”]. It would be expedient to have glance at Article 
18 of Constitution, which is reproduced as under: 
“Article 18: Freedom of trade, business or profession. Subject to 
such qualifications, if any, as may be prescribed by law, every 
citizen shall have the right to enter upon any lawful profession or 
occupation, and to conduct any lawful trade or business: 
  
   Provided that nothing in this Article shall prevent:- 
(a)  the regulation of any trade or profession by a licensing 
system; or 
(b)  the regulation of trade, commerce or industry in the interest 
of free competition therein; or 
(c)  the carrying on, by the Federal Government or a Provincial 
Government, or by a corporation controlled by any such 
Government, of any trade, business, industry or service, to 
the exclusion, complete or partial, of other persons.”   
 
There is no cavil or cudgel that the right of profession is treated 
as a fundamental right but it is subject to such qualification as 
settled by the law and every citizen has to follow the 
commandments of the law in this regard. The Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in a judgment cited as Lahore Development 
Authority through D.G and others Vs. Ms. Imrana Tiwana and 
others (2015 SCMR 1739) has held that the power to strike down 
or declare a legislative enactment as void is to be exercised with 
great care and caution and has laid down certain conditions for 
exercising such power. For reference, relevant portion of the 
judgment (supra) is reproduced as under:  

 
I.C.A. No.31531/2022

“64. The power to strike down or declare a legislative enactment 
void, however, has to be exercised with a great deal of care and 
caution. The Courts are one of the three coordinate institutions of 
the State and can only perform this solemn obligation in the 
exercise of their duty to uphold the Constitution. This power is 
exercised not because the judiciary is an institution superior to the 
legislature or the executive but because it is bound by its oath to 
uphold, preserve and protect the Constitution. It must enforce the 
Constitution as the Supreme Law but this duty must be performed 
with due care and caution and only when there is no other 
alternative. 
65. Cooley in his “Treatise on Constitutional Limitations”, Pages 
159 to 186, H.M. Seervai in “Constitutional Law of India”, Volume 
I, Pages 260 to 262, the late Mr. A.K. Brohi in “Fundamental Law 
of Pakistan”, Pages 562 to 592, Mr. Justice Fazal Karim in “Judicial 
Review of Public Actions” Volume I, Pages 488 to 492 state the 
rules which must be applied in discharging this solemn duty to 
declare laws unconstitutional. These can be summarized as follows: 
I.  
There is a presumption in favour of constitutionality and a 
law must not be declared unconstitutional unless the statute 
is placed next to the Constitution and no way can be found 
in reconciling the two; 
II. 
Where more than one interpretation is possible, one of which 
would make the law valid and the other void, the Court must 
prefer the interpretation which favours validity; 
III.  
A statute must never be declared unconstitutional unless its 
invalidity is beyond reasonable doubt. A reasonable doubt 
must be resolved in favour of the statute being valid; 
IV.  
If a case can be decided on other or narrower grounds, the 
Court will abstain from deciding the constitutional question; 
V.  
The Court will not decide a larger constitutional question 
than is necessary for the determination of the case; 
VI.  
The Court will not declare a statute unconstitutional on the 
ground that it violates the spirit of the Constitution unless it 
also violates the letter of the Constitution; 
VII.  
The Court is not concerned with the wisdom or prudence of 
the legislation but only with its constitutionality; 
VIII.  The Court will not strike down statutes on principles of 
republican or democratic government unless those principles 
are placed beyond legislative encroachment by the 
Constitution; 
IX.  
Mala fides will not be attributed to the Legislature.”   
   
The respondent failed to bring on record that the Rule 1042(C) of 
the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978 is in violation of the Article 18 of 
the Constitution or hit by any of the aforementioned conditions 
settled by the Hon’ble Apex Court of the country.  
7. 
Further, the prerogative of setting the eligibility criteria of 
a certain post exclusive falls within the domain of the concerned 
authority/executive and interfering in that domain would amount 

 
I.C.A. No.31531/2022

to committing judicial overreach which is unwarranted by law. 
Reliance in this regard placed on a recent pronouncement cited as 
Chief Executive Officer, Multan Electric Power Company Ltd. 
Khanewal Road, Multan Vs. Muhammad Ilyas and others (2021 
SCMR 775) wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
held as under: 
“6. In the instant case, the judge instead of deciding the case on 
merits, passed the final order of appointment of respondent no.1 
without adjudicating the issue in hand and then executed the order 
by directing the petitioner that the Appointment Letter be issued by 
the next date of hearing. By assuming the role of the Executive the 
judge disregarded his core function of adjudication, in accordance 
with law. Ignoring the constitutional boundaries of separation of 
powers can easily equip a judge with a false sense of power and 
authority. This is a dangerous tendency and must be guarded against 
to ensure that the judicial role continues to remain within its 
constitutional limits.  
7. When judiciary encroaches upon the domain of the Executive, as 
in this case, where the learned judge disregarded the eligibility 
criteria and the recruitment policy of the Executive Authority and 
assumed the function of the Executive, it is said to commit judicial 
overreach – which occurs when a court acts beyond its jurisdiction 
and interferes in areas which fall within the Executive and/or the 
Legislature’s mandate. Through such interference the court violates 
the doctrine of separation of powers by taking on the executive 
functions upon itself. The instant case is a textbook case of judicial 
overreach, where a judge directs an authority to issue an 
Appointment Letter disregarding the recruitment process, merit and 
the employment policy of the executive authority. Such judicial role 
imperils the separation of powers, jeopardizes the legitimacy of the 
judicial institution and undermines constitutional democracy. It is 
imperative that the courts do not derogate from their constitutionally 
mandated oversight function of judicial review. Certain values in 
the Constitution have been designated as foundational to our 
democracy which means that, as corner-stones of our democracy, 
they must be scrupulously observed. It is a sure recipe for a 
constitutional crisis if these values are not observed and their 
precepts are not carried out conscientiously.”   
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
  
It is settled law that it is not for the Court to examine the 
qualification and eligibility in a recruitment process and it cannot 
delve deeper into the design and need of the employing 
institution or second guess their selection criteria and job 
recruitment and these matters can be best resolved by the 
institution itself according to the suitability and requirements of a 
certain post. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case 

 
I.C.A. No.31531/2022 
 
7
cited as Muhammad Ashraf Sangri Vs. Federation of Pakistan 
and others (2014 SCMR 157) has held that the question of 
fitness of any candidate for a particular post is subjective matter  
and can best be assessed by the functionaries who are entrusted 
with this responsibility. In another case cited as The Secretary 
Punjab Public Service Commission, Lahore and others Vs. Aamir 
Hayat and others (2019 SCMR 124), the Hon’ble Apex Court 
has held that the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 
of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is 
limited to the extent of ensuring that state functionaries do what 
they are required by law to do and refrain from doing what they 
are prohibited by law to do and unless an act or omission of a 
state functionary falls within the above parameters it is not liable 
to be interfered with. It has further been held that such 
interference would constitute overstepping its jurisdiction by the 
High Court and entering the domain of the executive which is 
contrary to the concept of trichotomy of powers as per the 
scheme of the Constitution. In this regard, the reliance is placed 
on a case cited as Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through 
Chief Secretary, Peshawar and others Vs. Hayat Hussain and 
others (2016 SCMR 1021).  
  
In these circumstances, the prescribed vision 6x6 without 
glasses is an essential requirement which cannot be dispensed 
with and any deviation from the said criteria would allow entry to 
ineligible persons and deprive many eligible candidates. Thus, 
the autonomy and free choice of the employing institution/ 
appellants must be respected and be allowed to recruit according 
to the criteria advertised. Reliance in this regard is placed on a 
recent pronouncement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
rendered on 07.12.2022 in Civil Petition No.4806 of 2019 titled 
as Waqas Aslam & others Vs. Lahore Electric Supply Company 
Limited etc.
