ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. Through this Constitutional 
Petition, the petitioners have challenged the orders dated 
15.04.2022, 05.01.2021, 21.12.2020 & 28.10.2016 passed by 
the respondents. 
2. 
Relevant facts are that defunct Tehsil Municipal 
Administration, Renala Khurd (TMA), advertised various posts 
of Drivers & Helpers in BS-1 to BS-4 vide Advertisements 
dated 11.06.2006 and 20.08.2007 (Advertisements). The age 
limit for said posts was 18 to 25 years and after applying upper 
age relaxation allowed across the board, the maximum upper 
age limit was 30 years. The petitioners, who were few months 
beyond upper age limit of 30 years, were granted age relaxation 
for period beyond 30 years under Section 5(3) of the Punjab 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (2) - 
 
 
 
 
 
Local Council Services (Appointment and Conditions of 
Service) Rules, 1983 (Rules) by the concerned TMA vide 
letters dated 30.08.2006 and 09.10.2007. The petitioners No.1 
to 3 were consequently appointed on contract for a period of 
three years vide appointment order dated 30.08.2006 and 
petitioners No.4 & 5 vide order dated 31.08.2007. The contract 
of the petitioners No.1 to 3 was also further extended. In 
meanwhile the Regularization Policy dated 14.10.2009 was 
issued by the Services & General Administration Department 
(Regulation Wing), Government of Punjab (Regularization 
Policy), to regularize the services of contract appointees in BS-
01 to BS-15. The said Regularization Policy was also adopted 
to regularize the services of employees from BS-01 to BS-15 of 
the Local Government vide Notification dated 07.11.2009 
(Notification). The petitioners were, however, not regularized 
on the ground that they were overage at the time of recruitment. 
The petitioners being aggrieved filed Writ Petition No.14135 of 
2010 which was disposed of by this Court on 12.04.2016 with 
direction to respondent No.2 to decide the representation of the 
petitioners. The said respondent, vide order dated 28.10.2016, 
rejected the representation on the ground that the petitioners 
were overage at the time of contract appointment, hence, cannot 
be regularized under the Notification. The petitioners again 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (3) - 
 
 
 
 
 
filed Writ Petition No.35620 of 2016, which was allowed by 
this Court on 13.10.2020 and matter was sent back to 
respondent No.2 to pass reasoned and speaking order. The said 
respondent after giving hearing on 08.12.2020, dismissed the 
representation on 21.12.2020, and also terminated the services 
of the petitioners on 05.01.2021.  The petitioners again filed 
Writ Petition No.844/2021, which was disposed of on 
21.10.2021 with direction to respondent No.1 (Chief Secretary, 
Punjab) to decide the matter against the impugned order as well 
as termination order. The respondent No.1 through impugned 
order dated 15.04.2022 dismissed the appeal of the petitioners, 
hence, this Constitutional Petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the age 
beyond the prescribed age in Advertisements was already 
relaxed by the Competent Authority and once the said age 
relaxation orders were implemented and the petitioners were 
not only appointed on contract but also allowed to complete 
their tenure of three years’, subsequently their regularization 
cannot be denied on this ground. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the respondents as well as learned 
Law Officer, on the other hand, submits that under the 
Regularization Policy and Notification the services of only 
those contract employees could be regularized who fulfilled the 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (4) - 
 
 
 
 
 
criteria of age, qualification and physical fitness etc. at the time 
of their contract employment. He submits that all the petitioners 
being beyond the prescribed age limit of 30 years in the 
Advertisements at the time of their contract employments, they 
were not entitled for their regularization and their services were 
lawfully terminated. Submits that impugned orders do not 
suffer from any illegality. 
5. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and 
perused the record. 
6. 
There is no dispute that in the Advertisements the 
prescribed age limit was 18 to 25 years and after applying five 
years’ age relaxation allowed by the Government of Punjab 
across the board, the maximum upper age for appointment 
against the posts in-question was 30 years. However, it is also 
admitted position on record that the age of the petitioners 
beyond 30 years was relaxed by the Tehsil Municipal Officer 
(TMO) concerned under the Rule 5(3) of the Rules vide order 
dated 30.08.2006 in respect of petitioners No.1 to 3 and order 
dated 09.10.2007 in respect of petitioners No.4 & 5. Under 
Proviso to Sub-rule (3) of Rule 5 of the Rules, the appointing 
Authority being competent Authority can allow upper age limit 
up to five years. The perusal of appointment orders dated 
30.08.2006 and 31.08.2007 shows that same have been issued 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (5) - 
 
 
 
 
 
by the TMO upon recommendation of the Selection Committee. 
Therefore, the upper age of petitioners was relaxed under Rule 
5(3) of the Rules by the same Authority who appointed the 
petitioners. It is neither case of the respondents that appointing 
Authority was not competent nor it is claimed that age 
relaxation orders dated 30.08.2006 and 09.10.2007 were 
recalled/cancelled being issued illegally or by incompetent 
Authority. Rather record depicts that the said relaxation of age 
order dated 30.08.2006 in respect of petitioners No.1 to 3 was 
duly acted upon and the said petitioners were not only 
appointed on contract for a period of three years but after 
completing their terms they were also granted extension. In 
respect of petitioners No.4 & 5, though upper age relaxation 
order was issued on 09.10.2007 after their appointment on 
31.08.2007 but again neither those petitioners’ service contracts 
were terminated being beyond prescribed age nor the upper age 
relaxation order dated 09.10.2007 was recalled/cancelled till 
date rather they were allowed to complete their tenure of three 
years and in meanwhile the Regularization Policy and 
Notification were issued.  
7. 
In the above circumstances, vested right accrued in 
favour of the petitioners and under the doctrine of locus 
poenitentiae now they cannot be denied regularization under the 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (6) - 
 
 
 
 
 
Regularization Policy and Notification on the ground that their 
age at the time of recruitment was beyond 30 years. The age 
relaxation orders, passed by the appointing Authority under the 
Rules, being not set-aside/cancelled during the contract service 
of the petitioners, the respondent-department was estopped 
subsequently to deny regularization under Regularization 
Policy or Notification on the ground that the petitioners at the 
time of appointment were beyond the prescribed age of 30 
years. 
8. 
In similar situations, the hon’ble Supreme Court and 
learned High Courts of different provinces from time to time 
applied the doctrine of vested rights and locus poenitentiae in 
following case law. 
i) 
In 
“INSPECTOR 
GENERAL 
OF 
POLICE, 
QUETTA and another Vs. FIDA MUHAMMAD 
and others” (2022 SCMR 1583), hon’ble Supreme 
Court held as under: 
“11. The doctrine of vested right upholds 
and preserves that once a right is coined in 
one 
locale, 
its 
existence 
should 
be 
recognized everywhere and claims based on 
vested rights are enforceable under the law 
for its protection. A vested right by and 
large is a right that is unqualifiedly secured 
and does not rest on any particular event or 
set of circumstances. In fact, it is a right 
independent 
of 
any 
contingency 
or 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (7) - 
 
 
 
 
 
eventuality which may arise from a 
contract, statute or by operation of law. The 
doctrine of locus poenitentiae sheds light on 
the power of receding till a decisive step is 
taken but it is not a principle of law that an 
order once passed becomes irrevocable and 
a past and closed transaction. If the order is 
illegal then perpetual rights cannot be 
gained on the basis of such an illegal order 
but in this case, nothing was articulated to 
allege that the respondents by hook and 
crook managed their appointments or 
committed any misrepresentation or fraud 
or their appointments were made on 
political consideration or motivation or they 
were not eligible or not local residents of 
the 
district 
advertised 
for 
inviting 
applications for job. On the contrary, their 
cases were properly considered and after 
burdensome exercise, their names were 
recommended 
by 
the 
Departmental 
Selection Committee, hence the appointment 
orders could not be withdrawn or rescinded 
once it had taken legal effect and created 
certain rights in favour of the respondents.” 
 
ii) 
In “Mst. BASHARAT JEHAN Vs. DIRECTOR-
GENERAL, 
FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT 
EDUCATION, FGEI (C/Q) RAWALPINDI and 
others” (2015 SCMR 1418), the hon’ble Apex 
Court held as under words:- 
“20. Once a right is accrued to the 
appellant by appointment letters issued after 
complying with all the codal formalities 
could not be taken away on mere 
assumption and or supposition and or 
whims 
and 
fancy 
of 
any 
executive 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (8) - 
 
 
 
 
 
functionary. Such right once vests, cannot 
be destroyed or withdrawn as legal bar 
would come into play under the well 
doctrine 
of 
locus 
poenitentiae, 
well 
recognized 
and 
entrenched 
in 
our 
jurisprudence (One may refer to Director, 
Social Welfare, N.W.F.P., Peshawar v. 
Sadullah Khan (1996 SCMR 1350).” 
 
iii) 
In “PAKISTAN INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES 
CORPORATION through Chairman and others Vs. 
SHAHZAD FAROOQ MALIK and another” (2004 
SCMR 158) it is held as under:- 
“There is no cavil with the proposition that 
the authority has the power to undo the act 
done by it but such provision would be 
subject to the relevant laws and the Rules 
and would be applicable only in those cases 
where under the relevant law or the Rules a 
different intention does not appear. In the 
present case, the Corporation has its law 
and the Rules which govern the service 
under the Corporation. The authority could 
remove the employee who has been 
appointed in violation of the Rules but such 
action could be taken when no decisive 
steps had been taken in pursuance of the 
appointments. In the instant case, the 
respondents after their appointment were 
confirmed in service by the P.I.A.C., hence, 
valuable rights had accrued to 'them which 
could not be interfered with only on the 
ground that they were irregularly appointed 
by the P.I,A.C itself unless there were other 
allegations against them, in view of the 
principle of locus poenitentiae.” 
 
iv) 
In “CHAIRMAN, SELECTION COMMITTEE / 
PRINCIPAL, 
KIND 
EDWARD 
MEDICAL 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (9) - 
 
 
 
 
 
COLLEGE, LAHORE and 2 others Vs. WASIF 
ZAMIR AHMAD and another” (1997 SCMR 15), 
hon’ble Supreme Court observed as under:- 
“The decision of the petitioners to give 
admission to the respondent No.1 was 
implemented in letter and spirit. He, 
therefore, cannot be deprived of his vested 
right which he had earned on the basis of 
act of the petitioners.” 
 
v) 
In “CHIEF SECRETARY, GOVERNMENT OF 
SINDH and another Vs. SHER MUHAMMAD 
MAKHDOOM and 2 others” (PLD 1991 Supreme 
Court 973), august Supreme Court held as under:- 
“It is quite apparent that restrictions in 
para. 4 of the Revenue Department‟s 
Notification mentioned above, pertain to the 
appointment as Mukhtiarkar and in the case 
under consideration will have no bearing 
for the reason that respondents were 
granted exemptions in accordance with 
circulars, requirements of which were duly 
fulfilled by them and not only that but 
exemptions were implemented and they 
receive, 
necessary 
training, 
as 
such 
valuable rights had accrued to them which 
could not be interfered with. In this context, 
reference can be made to section 20 of 
General Clauses Act and guidelines laid 
down in the case of Pakistan v. Muhammad 
Himayatullah Farukhi (PLD 1969 Supreme 
Court 407), in which it is held that principle 
of locus poenitentiae is available to the 
Government or relevant authorities and 
further authority which is competent to 
make order has power to undo it, but such 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (10) - 
 
 
 
 
 
order cannot be  withdrawn or rescinded 
once it has taken legal effect and created 
certain rights in favour of any individual. It 
appears that Service Tribunal has allowed 
appeals of the respondents mainly on this 
ground with cogent reasons in support 
thereof.” 
 
vi) 
In “PAKISTAN THROUGH THE SECRETARY, 
MINISTRY OF FINANCE Vs. MUHAMMAD 
HIMAYATULLAH 
FARUKHI” 
(PLD 
1969 
Supreme Court 407) the doctrine of locus 
poenitentiae applied in following terms:- 
“There can hardly be any dispute with the 
rule as laid down, in these cases that apart 
from the provisions of section 21 of the 
General Clauses Act, locus poenitentiae, 
i.e., the power of receding till a decisive 
step is taken, is available to the Government 
or the relevant authorities. In fact, the 
existence of such a power is necessary in 
the case of all authorities empowered to 
pass orders to retrace the wrong steps taken 
by them. The authority that has the power to 
make an order has also the power to undo 
it. But this is subject to the exception that 
where the order has taken legal effect, and 
in pursuance thereof certain rights have 
been created in favour of any individual, 
such an order cannot be withdrawn or 
rescinded to the detriment of those rights.” 
 
vii) 
In 
“QURAT-UL-AIN 
Vs. 
QAZI 
ZIAN-UL-
ABADEEN and others” (2020 PLC (C.S) 400), 
hon’ble Supreme Court (AJ & K) held as under:- 
“We deem it proper to observe here that 
although, the Gold Medal is not awarded 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (11) - 
 
 
 
 
 
for M.Phil degree, but in view of the 
peculiar facts of the case especially when a 
right had already been accrued to the 
respondent in the light of the policy 
prevailing at the relevant time, the appellant 
cannot be benefited on such ground. As the 
respondent has got the top merit position in 
the selection process, therefore, he cannot 
be deprived of his right for appointment by 
making any subsequent amendment in the 
rules/policy already holding the filed.” 
 
viii) In 
“AAMIR 
TUFAIL 
CHAUDHARY 
Vs. 
GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB and 2 others” (2018 
PLC (C.S.) 493), this Court held as under:- 
“It is settled principle of law that once a 
decisive step has been taken by the relevant 
authority the same cannot be retracted since 
it has vested valuable rights. The offer letter 
was issued to the Petitioner and the 
Petitioner in consequence whereof fulfilled 
all the terms and conditions of the offer 
letter by having his degrees verified and 
having a fresh medical examination. The 
Respondents under the principle of locus 
poenitentiae cannot deny the Petitioner the 
post as valuable rights had accrued to the 
petitioner and the same could not be 
recalled.” 
 
ix) 
In “AMMAD AHMAD Vs. NATIONAL HIGHWAY 
AUTHORITY through its Chairman and 5 others” 
(2018 PLC (C.S) Note 187), this Court observed 
as follows:- 
“15. Under the law, decisive step taken by 
the authority cannot be withdrawn. Law is 
well settled that once a right is created by 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (12) - 
 
 
 
 
 
extending benefit for no default of a person, 
the same cannot be taken away on mere 
assumption, supposition, whims and fancy. 
Such right, once vested, could not be 
destroyed or withdrawn as legal bar would 
come into play under the doctrine of locus 
poenitentiae. Even in presence of any legal 
defect in initial appointment, principle of 
locus 
poenitentiae 
would 
not 
permit 
competent authority to undo same after a 
long time and remove incumbent from 
service.” 
 
x) 
In “ADNAN AHMED Vs. PROVINCE OF SINDH 
through Chief Secretary to the Government of 
Sindh and 8 others” (PLD 2022 Sindh 542), the 
hon’ble Sindh High Court held as under:- 
“The respondents received letters for their 
appointment and are working on their 
respective 
post 
after 
completing 
the 
formalities which includes verification of 
their testimonials “Domicile and PRCs”. It 
is settled by now that once a right is 
accrued to the appellant by appointment 
letters issued after complying with all the 
codal formalities could not be taken away 
on mere assumption and or supposition and 
or whims and fancy of any executive 
functionary. Such right once vests, cannot 
be destroyed or withdrawn as legal bar 
would come into play under the well 
doctrine 
of 
locus 
poenitentiae, 
well 
recognized 
and 
entrenched 
in 
our 
jurisprudence.” 
 
xi) 
In “REHMAT SANOBER Vs. BALOCHISTAN 
PUBLIC 
SERVICE 
COMMISSION 
through 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (13) - 
 
 
 
 
 
Chairman and 2 others” (2015 PLC (C.S) 1246), 
the hon’ble Balochistan High Court held as under:- 
“10. So, we can confidently observe that 
the petitioner was under protection of the 
earlier policy of the Government of 
Balochistan as mentioned in the publication 
dated 22.02.2013 and even now when this 
matter is going to be decided the age limit 
provided 
by 
Notification 
dated 
25th 
February, 2013 is no more in the field. We 
are satisfied to hold that this is a policy 
matter and the relaxation in upper age limit 
extended by the Government of Balochistan 
earlier was not in violation of any 
fundamental right or a law nor did it suffer 
from any infirmity, inherent legal defect or 
want 
of 
authority. 
Thus, 
in 
these 
circumstances, the principle of „Locus 
Poenitentiae‟ fully attracts in this case and 
a legal vested right accrued to the petitioner 
cannot be taken away.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
9. 
The contract appointment orders in respect of petitioners 
were not only issued after complying codal formalities but they 
also completed their contract tenure, hence, vested right accrued 
in their favour and the respondents are estopped under the 
principle of locus poententiae discussed above to deny 
regularization of the petitioners on the ground that they were 
overage at the time of their contract appointment. It is also 
settled law that parties should not be made to suffer for action 
or inaction of the authority who was obliged to follow the law. 

W.P. No.30365/2022       
 
 
                                    - (14) - 
 
 
 
 
 
In this regard, reliance is placed on “Province of Punjab 
through Secretary, Agriculture, Government of Punjab and 
others Vs. Zulfiqar Ali” (2006 SCMR 678). 
10. 
In view of above discussion, this Writ Petition is allowed 
and by setting-aside the impugned orders, the respondents are 
directed to reinstate and regularize the services of the 
petitioners forthwith.
