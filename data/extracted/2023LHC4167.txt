R.S.A No.14411 of 2019 
 
Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited 
Vs. 
M/s Zam Zam CNG 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MUHAMMAD RAZA QURESHI, J. Through this Regular Second 
Appeal under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
(“CPC”), the Appellant, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited 
(“SNGPL”) has questioned the concurrent findings contained in the 
Impugned Judgments and Decrees dated 18.02.2016 and 29.11.2017 
passed by the Trial Court and Appellate Court respectively. Since, the 
instant Appeal as well as connected Regular Second Appeal bearing 
No.14408 of 2019 raise identical questions of law and facts, therefore, 
same are decided together.  
2. 
Inessential details apart, the Respondent filed a Suit for 
declaration and permanent injunction and challenged the enhanced 
rate of tariff for high GCV and questioned the recovery of an amount 
of Rs.1,692,452/-. The learned Trial Court decreed the Suit filed by 
Respondent through Judgment and Decree dated 18.02.2016. The said 
Judgment and Decree was questioned by the Appellant which upon 
evaluation of evidence and findings on six issues framed by learned 
Trial Court was dismissed by the Appellate Court through Judgment 
Date of Hearing 
03.05.2023 
Appellant by: 
M/s. Faisal Yaqoob Khan, Advocate. 
Khawaja

Assistant 
Attorney General. 
Respondent by: 
M/s. Hassan Iqbal Warraich & Arslan Abbas 
Buttar, Advocates.

               R.S.A No.14411 and 14408 of 2019 
 
 
and Decree dated 29.11.2017. The primary reason that prevailed with 
both learned Courts below was the admission of the witnesses of the 
Appellant who conceded in their depositions that upon shifting of 
source of supply to the Respondent from one zone to another, no 
notice was given to it with respect to change of rate at high GCV. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the Appellant submits that while deciding 
issues of law as well as facts both the learned Courts below misread 
evidence on record and Appellant was well within its right to claim 
excessive amount without any notice to the Respondent. According to 
learned counsel the benefit extended to the Respondent through 
Impugned Judgments and Decrees is illegal and unlawful. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondent while 
supporting 
Impugned 
Judgments 
and 
Decrees 
submits 
that 
Respondent cogently established its case through evidence and 
according to learned counsel the contentions of misreading and non-
reading of evidence cannot be entertained in Regular Second Appeal, 
as right to file Second Appeal as provided under Section 100 CPC, 
could only be set into motion when the decision Impugned is contrary 
to law or there was failure to determine some material issues of law, 
therefore, the questions now being raised by the Appellant cannot be 
entertained by this Court while adjudicating upon instant Appeals. 
Additionally, learned counsel submits that Judgment and Decree of 
the Appellate Court was passed on 29.11.2017 against which 
Appellant filed Appeal on 12.02.2018 through diary No.163588. 
According to learned counsel upon institution of Appeal, the office 
raised objections and file was retrieved by the Appellant from the 
office and after removal of objection, the Appeal was re-filed on 
11.03.2019. Therefore, according to learned counsel these Appeals are 
barred by time and cannot be pressed by the Appellant. According to 
learned counsel despite having concurrent findings in its favour, the 
Respondent even after lapse of 07 years is unable to reap fruits and 
benefits of the Impugned Judgments and Decrees.

5. 
Arguments of learned counsel have been heard and record has 
been perused with their able assistance. The relationship inter se 
parties is admitted. The question that was determined by the Courts 
below through Impugned Judgments and Decrees was whether 
contrary to the terms of Gas Supply Agreement excess amount could 
have been claimed by the Appellant upon shifting of supply zones 
without notice or intimation to the Respondent. 
6. 
In Gas Sector, CNG industry is only consumer of SNGPL 
which fills CNG cylinders by compressing natural gas instead of 
burning and consuming it. The tariff for consumption of Compressed 
Natural Gas is determined by the competent authority i.e. Oil & Gas 
Regulatory Authority (“OGRA”), which is actually Energy based 
instead of Value based and BTU’s consumed are calculated on the 
basis of Standard Cubic Feet which are measured by heating capacity 
of Gross Calorific Value (GCV). It was case of the Respondent that 
natural gas supplied from South zone was with BTUs/SCG950GCV 
and according to OGRA Tariff the price for gas from said zone was 
Rs.53.63 and Rs.55.33 per K.G. The Appellant issued gas bill to the 
Respondent for the month of June, 2010 and charged 16% 
exaggerated value on the ground that in the said month the gas was 
supplied 
to 
the 
Respondent 
form 
North 
zone 
with 
BUT’s/SCF1000GCV. It was this aspect evaluated by the learned 
Courts in the light of terms and conditions contained in the Gas 
Supply Agreement and upon analysis of respective evidence led by 
the parties both Courts below reached to concurrent findings that since 
witnesses of SNGPL in their depositions admitted that no notice as 
per agreement and practice for change of zones was given to the 
Respondent, therefore, 16% excessive charge for gas consumption for 
the month of June, 2010 was illegal and unlawful.  
7. 
Learned counsel has been questioned about the questions of 
law that may justify institution of this Appeal in terms of Section 100 
of the CPC and despite hectic efforts, this Court is not convinced that 
in peculiar circumstances of instant case, the questions of re-appraisal, 

-4- 
               R.S.A No.14411 and 14408 of 2019 
 
 
re-hearing and re-evaluating the evidence of the determination of facts 
can be undertaken at this stage, that too in a Second Appeal. Law 
clearly draws distinction between scope of first appeal and second 
appeal. Under Section 100 of the CPC, appeal only lies to High Court 
on the grounds that the decision is either contrary to law or it fails to 
determine some material issue of law or it suffers from substantial 
error or defect in the procedure provided by the Code or law. Meaning 
thereby that it does not lie to question the findings on facts especially 
when these findings are concurrent and nature of challenge raised by 
Appellant is bereft of material on record.  
8. 
In the instant case, it is quite obvious that the Impugned 
Judgments and Decrees of the Courts below are neither contrary to 
law nor contrary to any usage having the force of law. The concurrent 
Impugned Judgments and Decrees also reflect that the Courts below 
had not omitted to decide any material issue on law or usage having 
the force of law. So far as the question of substantial error is 
concerned, this Court is satisfied that no substantial error arises from 
the Impugned Judgments and Decrees and the Instant Appeals even 
fail to cross the minimum standards set up by Section 100 of the CPC. 
Reliance in this regard is placed upon “Bahar Shah and others versus 
Manzoor Ahmad” (2022 SCMR 284), “Zafar Iqbal and others versus 
Naseer Ahmed and others” (2022 SCMR 2006) and “Syed Rafiul 
Qadre Naqvi versus Syeda Safia Sultana and others” (2009 SCMR 
254). In a recent case of Zafar Iqbal supra, the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan while interpreting the scope and ambit of section 
100 of the CPC has declared that:- 
“Appeal under section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908 ("C.P.C."), a second appeal to the High Court lies only on 
any of the following grounds: (a) the decision being contrary to 
law or usage having the force of law; (b) the decision having 
failed to determine some material issue of law or usage having 
the force of law; and (c) a substantial error or defect in the 
procedure provided by C.P.C. or by any other law for the time 
being in force, which may possibly have produced error or 
defect in the decision of the case upon merits. The scope of 
second appeal is thus restricted and limited to these grounds, as 

-5- 
               R.S.A No.14411 and 14408 of 2019 
 
 
section 101 expressly mandates that no second appeal shall lie 
except on the grounds mentioned in section 100. But we have 
noticed that notwithstanding such clear provisions on the scope 
of second appeal, sometimes the High Courts deal with and 
decide second appeals as if those were first appeals: they thus 
assume and exercise a jurisdiction which the High Courts do 
not possess, and thereby also contribute for unjustified 
prolongation of litigation process which is already chocked 
with high pendency of cases.” 
9. 
The second contention of learned counsel for the Respondent 
about time barred appeal is also creditworthy and carries weight. It 
appears that the Impugned Judgment and Decree passed by the 
Appellate Court is dated 29.11.2017. The Appeal was filed through 
diary No.163588 on 12.02.2018 to which office raised objection and 
typed Objection Sheet (Civil) described date for re-submission of 
Appeal after removal of objections was 03 days.  
10. 
Admittedly, instead of re-submitting the file after removal of 
objections within prescribed limitation, the Appellant re-filed the 
Appeal on 11.03.2019. Hence, when the Appeal was re-filed it had 
become barred by time. In a Judgment reported as “Asad Ali and 9 
others versus The Bank of Punjab and others” (PLD 2020 SC 736), 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that there is 
consistency in the principles that if objections raised by the office are 
not removed during the period allowed by the office and meanwhile 
the limitation period expires, the Petition become barred by time. 
While relying upon “Lahore Development Authority vs. Muhammad 
Rashid” (1997 SCMR 1224), the Hon’ble Supreme Court held:-  
“Starting from the judgment of the Lahore High Court Lahore 
reported as Ghulam Hussain V. Bahadar (PLD 1954 Lahore 361) 
till judgment of this Court reported as Lahore Development 
Authority v. Muhammad Rashid (1997 SCMR 1224), there is 
consistency in the principle that if objections raised by the office are 
not removed during the period allowed by the office and meanwhile 
the limitation period expires, the petition would become barred by 
time. There are two subsequent judgments of this Court reported as 
Mst. Sabiran Bi v. Ahmad Khan (2000 SCMR 847) and Farman All 
v. Muhammad Ishaq (PLD 2013 SC 392) which are incorrectly 
understood to have decided that so long as the initial institution is 
within the limitation period, removal of objections raised by the 
office after expiry of the limitation period does not render the 
petition to be barred by time. The said judgments have been 

-6- 
               R.S.A No.14411 and 14408 of 2019 
 
 
rendered in a different set of facts and circumstances, do not lay 
down the entire law on the subject and are distinguishable on points 
of law as well as facts.” 
11. 
Since concurrent findings contained in the Impugned 
Judgments and Decrees have been passed after evaluating the legal as 
well as factual aspects; evidence on record and admissions made 
during cross-examination by the witnesses presented by SNGPL and 
appreciating the position of law with respect to interpretation of 
subject matter Gas Supply Agreement, therefore, this Court is not 
persuaded to interfere in the Impugned Judgments and Decrees on 
their merits. Additionally, this Court holds that by virtue of delayed 
re-submission of the instant Appeal, the same is barred by time in 
view of law laid down in Asad Ali’s case supra.  Consequently, the 
instant as well as connected R.S.A are dismissed with no order as to 
costs.
