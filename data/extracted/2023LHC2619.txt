RFA No. 6825 of 2020 
(Muhammad Ali Khalid v. Muhammad Talha) 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing: 
 
12.05.2023 
 
Appellant by: 
Mr. Zahoor-ul-Hassan, Advocate.  
 
Respondent by: 
Rana Muhammad Ishaque, Advocate.  
 
 
 
Faisal Zaman Khan, J. Through this Regular First 
Appeal, order and decree dated 14.01.2020 passed by the Additional 
District Judge, Samundari has been assailed, by virtue of which while 
rejecting an application for leave to appear and defend the suit filed by 
the appellant, a suit for recovery of Rs.2,000,000/- under Order XXXVII 
CPC filed by the respondent against the appellant has been decreed.  
 
2. 
 
The facts giving rise to the present appeal are that on the 
strength of a cheque dated 08.08.2019 issued by the appellant in favour 
of the respondent, a suit under Order XXXVII CPC for recovery of 
Rs.2,000,000/- was filed by the respondent against the appellant, in 
which an application for leave to appear and defend the suit was filed by 
the appellant which was dismissed being barred by time and thereupon 
the suit was decreed through the impugned order and decree, hence this 
appeal.  
 
3. 
 
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that appellant was 
never served and as and when he came to know about the pendency of 
the suit, an application for leave to appear and defend the suit was filed, 

Regular First Appeal No. 6825/2020 
2
which was within time therefore the trial court erred in law in dismissing 
the same being barred by time and decreed the suit.  
 
4. 
 
Replying to the above, learned counsel for the respondent 
supports the impugned order and decree.  
 
5. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
 
6. 
 
Order XXXVII CPC is a special dispensation. Under this 
Order and unlike in a regular civil suit, procedure has been provided to 
file and proceed with the suit filed on the basis of negotiable instruments, 
as contemplated in the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881. In a suit filed 
under this Order, which is summary in nature, under Rule 3 of the said 
Order, a defendant who has been served, within stipulated time has to 
seek leave to appear and defend the suit and once the leave is granted, the 
suit shall be converted into a regular civil suit and will be decided in 
accordance with the general procedure prescribed in CPC.  
 
7. 
 
Unlike the regular civil suit where summons for service of 
the defendant are issued under Order V Rules 1 & 5 CPC, the format of 
which is given in Form No. II Appendix-B CPC in a suit filed under 
Order XXXVII CPC, under Rule 2 of the said Order, a defendant has to 
be issued summons in the specific format as given in Form No. 4 
Appendix-B CPC. 
 
8. 
 
In order to differentiate between the nature of these 
summonses, the text as given in Form Nos. 2 and 4, Appendix-B CPC 
are reproduced:

NOTICE---1. Should you apprehend your 
witnesses will not attend of their own 
accord, you can have a summons from 
this Court to compel the attendance of 
any witness, and the production of any 
document that you have a right to call

to the Court and on depositing the 
necessary expenses.  
2.  
If you admit the claim, you should 
pay the money into Court together with 
the costs of the suit, to avoid execution of 
the decree, which may be against your

9. 
 
A cumulative reading of the above summonses would show 
that unlike a regular civil suit, where defendant is called to appear in the 
court, either himself or through a representative, in a suit filed under 

Regular First Appeal No. 6825/2020 
4
Order XXXVII CPC defendant can only contest the suit subject to grant 
of leave to appear and defend the suit, that too on an application filed by 
him within 10 days of his service of summons (see Order XXXVII Rule 
3 CPC), issued in the format given in Form 4, Appendix-B CPC (see 
Order XXXVII Rule 2 CPC). The text of the said summons would show 
that unlike summons issued in Form 2, Appendix-B CPC, the defendant 
is cautioned about the time line in which he has to file such an 
application and it is a sine qua non that the summons is to be 
accompanied by a copy of plaint.   
 
10. 
 
The above provision (Order XXXVII Rule 2 CPC) has been 
interpreted in judgments reported as Ahmad Shah and another v. Israr-
ud-Din [2016 CLC 1100], Shafqat Mehmood v. Muhammad Nazir [2014 
CLC 1222], Binyameen Khalil v. Riaz Ahmad Rahi [2014 CLC 105] and 
Muhammad Naeem Choudhry v. Aziz-ur-Rehman and another [2013 
CLC 1042], a cumulative reading of which would show that where the 
summons is not issued to a defendant in Form No. 4, Appendix-B CPC, 
it will be presumed that he has not been served and his limitation for 
filing the application for leave to appear and defend the suit would start 
from the date when he appeared before the court and filed such 
application.  
 
11. 
 
In the above backdrop, a perusal of the record would show 
that the suit was filed by the respondent against the appellant on 
28.10.2019 whereupon an order was passed on the same day that 
summons in the prescribed form be issued to the appellant with 
registered envelope A/D and the case was adjourned to 11.11.2019. On 
the given date, the process was returned with the report that appellant has 
avoided and concealed himself from service, in view of which 
summonses were again ordered to be issued to him through registered 
post A/D and the case was fixed for 16.11.2019. On the said date, again 
an order was passed by the trial court for issuance of summons to the 
appellant through registered post A/D and the case was adjourned for 
23.11.2019. On the given date, the trial court ordered that despite service 

Regular First Appeal No. 6825/2020 
5
none has entered appearance on behalf of the appellant therefore a 
publication in daily Aaj Kal may be issued and the case was adjourned 
for 05.12.2019 and on the said date, learned counsel for the appellant 
filed his power of attorney alongwith his application for leave to appear 
and defend the suit.  
 
12. 
 
Keeping in view the above provisions of law, a perusal of 
the record would further show that the initial 02 summonses issued to 
the appellant for 11.11.2019 and 16.11.2019 were not in the prescribed 
manner and form as contemplated in Order XXXVII Rule 2 and Form 
4, Appendix-B CPC as the said summonses were ordinary summonses 
which were issued under Order V Rules 1 & 5 and Form No. 2, 
Appendix-B CPC. A further perusal of the record would show that for 
service of the appellant, keeping in view order dated 16.11.2019, for the 
first time, summons in the format given in Form No. 4, Appendix-B 
CPC (correct format) was issued, which was required as per Order 
XXXVII Rule 2 CPC however on 22.11.2019 the Process Server 
reported at the back of the summons that he has received the summons 
(for service) today thus the time for service may be extended.  
 
13. 
 
In the above factual matrix, a perusal of the order-sheet 
would show that despite the fact that Process Server never served the 
appellant for 23.11.2019 or through summons issued in accordance with 
Form 4 Appendix-B CPC the trial court passed an order that since 
service of the appellant has been affected (factually incorrect) and none 
has entered appearance on his behalf therefore he may be served through 
substituted service.   
 
14. 
 
Be that as it may, since the appellant was never served 
through the prescribed summons as contemplated in Order XXXVII Rule 
2 and Form 4, Appendix-B CPC thus the publication in the newspaper 
could not be issued, hence, this cannot be said that he was ever served, 
therefore, as and when he appeared before the trial court with his 
application for leave to appear and defend the suit, his limitation for 

Regular First Appeal No. 6825/2020 
6
filing such an application would start from the day he enters appearance 
therefore the trial court erred in law in dismissing the application for 
leave to appear and defend the suit being barred by time and decreed the 
suit.   
 
15. 
 
For what has been discussed above, this appeal is allowed, 
as a sequel to which the impugned order and decree is set aside, 
resultantly, the suit filed by the respondent shall be deemed to be 
pending before the trial court, who shall decide the application for leave 
to appear and defend the suit filed by the appellant on merits and 
thereupon proceed with the suit.
