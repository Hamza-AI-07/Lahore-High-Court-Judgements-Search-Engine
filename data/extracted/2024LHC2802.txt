   ===================================== 
 
      MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J: This single 
judgment shall dispose of Criminal Revision No.31115 of 2021 
filed by Muhammad Shamoon and Ajmal Ali alias Ajju petitioners 
and Criminal Revision No.27750 of 2021 filed by Muhammad 
Asif, Fayyaz Ahmad, Shoukat Ali Malik and Babar Ali petitioners 
as both the above stated matters have arisen out of the same order 
dated 27.03.2021 passed by learned Special Judge (Central), 
Lahore, declining the request of petitioners for return of their legal 
money (Rs.9,50,000/- of petitioner No. 1 and Rs.4,50,000/- of 
petitioner No. 2 of Criminal Revision No.31115 of 2021) and 
(Rs.3,00,000/- of petitioner No. 1, Rs.2,00,000/- of petitioner No.2, 
Rs.50,000/- of petitioner No.3 and Rs.10,000/- of petitioner No.4 
of Criminal Revision No.27750 of 2021) allegedly recovered by 
respondent No. 2/Railway Police from them as an embezzled 
amount in relation to a case FIR No. 40 dated 05.05.2009 under 
sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 472, 109 PPC read with 5(2) 47

Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, Railway Police station, 
District Kasur. 
2.  
Learned counsel (s) for the petitioners contends that the 
petitioners were convicted by the learned trial Court in above said 
case, however on appeal, they were acquitted by this Court on 
02.03.2016. Respondent No.2/Railway Police assailed such 
judgment of acquittal by filing leave to appeal before the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan and during interregnum, petitions were filed for 
return of amount before the learned Special Judge (Central), 
Lahore, but were withdrawn with intent to refile at an appropriate 
stage. Petitioner No. 1 also a filed writ petition bearing No. 38451 
of 2017 in this respect but it was also dismissed by this Court vide 
order dated 30.10.2017 as not maintainable because the matter was 
pending before the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Finally, when the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan declined leave to appeal to the 
department, petitioners again filed applications of the same nature 
before the learned Special Judge (Central), Lahore but it met the 
same fate and dismissed on 27.03.2021, hence this revision 
petition.  
3.  
Learned counsel (s) for the petitioners contends that 
petitioners have finally been acquitted, and amount cited above did 
not remain case property any more, therefore being belongings of 
the petitioners must be returned to them. Further stated that as per 
section 517 of the Cr.P.C. after the decision of case, only trial 
Court was competent to decide the question of case property but 
such applications were dismissed on the ground that judgment of 
conviction dated 25.11.2010 stood merged into judgment of 
acquittal dated 02.03.2016 passed by High Court, therefore, trial 
Court lacks jurisdiction. Further states that now this Court in 
revisional jurisdiction is also competent to allow return of amount 
to the petitioners.  
4.  
On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent 
No.2/Railway Police stated that amount in question recovered as

     Criminal Revision No.31115 of 2021 
     Criminal Revision No.27750 of 2021 
 
 
 
case property was ordered to be confiscated in favour of Railway 
Department by the trial Court, therefore on reversal of judgment, it 
is the prerogative only of learned trial Court under section 517 of 
the Cr.P.C to determine the entitlement of the petitioners over the 
disputed/recovered amount, particularly when the petitioners in 
their statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. did not own such 
amount. Similar was the say of learned Assistant Attorney General.  
5.  
Arguments. Record perused.  
6.  
In order to determine the entitlement or otherwise of the 
petitioners to amount in question, it essential to first see what 
section 517 Cr.P.C. says in this context which is as under;  
 
517. Order for disposal of property regarding which 
offence committed. (1) When an inquiry or a trial in any 
Criminal Court is concluded, the Court may make such 
order as it thinks fit for the disposal by destruction, 
confiscation, or delivery to any person claiming to be 
entitled to possession thereof or otherwise of any property or 
document produced before it or in its custody or regarding 
which any offence appears to have been committed or which 
has been used for the commission of any offence.  
 
(2) When a High Court or Court of Sessions makes such 
order and cannot through its own officers conveniently 
deliver the property to the person entitled thereto, such 
Court may direct that the order be carried effect by the 
[District Officer (Revenue)]. 
  
(3) When an order is made under this section such order 
shall not, except where the property is livestock or subject to 
speedy and natural decay, and save as provided by 
subsection (4), be carried out for one month, or, when an 
appeal is presented, until such appeal has been disposed of.  
 
(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit any 
Court from delivering any property under the provisions of 
sub-section (1) to any person claiming to be entitled to the 
possession thereof, on his executing a bond with or without 
sureties to the satisfaction of the Court; engaging to restore 
such property to the Court if the order made under this 
section is modified or set aside on appeal. 
     
Above section clearly mentions that when an inquiry or trial is 
concluded, Court concerned may pass order for the disposal by 
destruction, confiscation, or delivery to any person claiming to be 
entitled to possession thereof or otherwise of any property or 
document. Conclusion of trial includes decision of case in appeal

     Criminal Revision No.31115 of 2021 
     Criminal Revision No.27750 of 2021 
 
 
 
when no order with respect to case property has been made by the 
appellate Court.  
 
7.  
There is no cavil to the proposition that under section 520 
of Cr.P.C. this Court is also authorized to pass an appropriate 
order in case learned trial Court fails to exercise power under 
section 517 Cr.P.C. Learned counsel for the petitioners could not 
controvert the fact that petitioners/accused have not claimed such 
amount as their own during the trial rather in their statements 
under section 342 Cr.P.C alleged that said amount was foisted 
upon them. Order passed by the learned trial Court clearly speaks 
that the petitions were not decided on merits but on technical 
ground that learned trial Court lacks jurisdiction due to acquittal 
order passed by this Court. In a case reported as “MANZOOR 
HUSSAIN JATOI Versus THE STATE” (1997 P Cr. L J 500) 
Federal Shariat Court has held as under; 
“Unless the Appellate Court exempts a particular relief 
in express terms, the order of acquittal should entail all 
the consequential effects thereof. A separate order for 
each and every consequence of the acquittal is not 
necessary. Therefore, the trial Court, acting on the basis 
of the order of acquittal recorded by the Honourable 
Supreme Court could have released the property. 
 
Section 520, Cr.PC referred to by the trial Court gives 
jurisdiction to the superior Court to interfere with an 
order passed by a lower Court under section 517, 518 
and 519, but it does in no way restrict a lower Court 
from passing an order consequent to, and in 
compliance with, the order of a superior Court.” 
 
                                                     (Emphasize supplied) 
 
When in a case, an accused stood discharged, this Court in a case 
reported as “JALAL KHAN alias JALLEY KHAN versus THE 
STATE AND ANOTHER” (PLD 1975 Lahore 45) has held as 
under:- 
 
“The learned Judge who decided the case was of the 
opinion that section 517, gives jurisdiction to the Court 
to pass necessary orders for the disposal of property 
either at the time of the conclusion of the trial or at a 
later date: It was further observed that section 517, cast 

 
5 
                                 
     Criminal Revision No.31115 of 2021 
     Criminal Revision No.27750 of 2021 
 
 
 
a duty on the Court to make some order regarding the 
disposal of the property which was in its custody and 
this duty continued until the property was disposed of 
in some way or other, either by destruction or by 
passing out of the hands of the Court” 
 
In a case reported as “ABDUL LATIF Versus ABDUL RAZAQ 
AND 2 OTHERS” (1976 P Cr. L J 116) it has been held as under:- 
 
“It is also not necessary that the order for disposal of 
property must be passed simultaneously with the 
judgment in the main case and it would not be illegal to 
pass such an order subsequently” 
 
8.    In this case trial Court has ordered confiscation of case 
property through a judgment of conviction and said decision has 
been reversed, therefore, principle of merger shall not apply, which 
attracts only if the appellate Court upholds the decision of trial 
Court or modify it in substance or relief but in the present case this 
Court has not upheld or modified the judgment of trial Court, 
rather quashed it, therefore, by all means, the situation has been 
reversed to the stage when during investigation amount was shown 
recovered from the petitioners, then accused, while opening an 
avenue for the petitioners to once again file the petitions on the 
analogy of section 516-A or 523 of Cr.P.C. but under section 517 
of Cr.P.C. No doubt this Court under section 520 Cr.P.C. can pass 
an appropriate order, but only when petition under section 517 
Cr.P.C. is decided by the trial Court on merits, which has not been 
done by the trial Court. Railway Department is contesting the 
claim on the basis of facts and contentions cited above, record of 
trial Court is also not before this Court and counter claims of the 
parties require a factual inquiry based on recording of evidence, if 
necessary, by the learned trial Court/Special Judge (Central) 
Lahore to determine entitlement of petitioners to alleged amount 
which function cannot be under taken by this Court while 
exercising revisional jurisdiction. Therefore, learned Special Judge 
(Central) Lahore/trial Court would better examine the entire record

     Criminal Revision No.31115 of 2021 
     Criminal Revision No.27750 of 2021 
 
 
 
while assessing the entitlement of the portioners for the amount 
claimed. 
 
9.  
Section 517 of Cr.P.C. is not an exhaustive section, Court 
after conclusion of trial can also refer the matter to Magistrate for 
disposal of property as mentioned in section 518 of Cr.P.C. which 
is reproduced here for reference; 
 
518. Order may take form of reference in lieu of itself 
passing an order under Section 517: The Court may direct 
the property to be delivered to [a Magistrate of the First 
Class] who shall in such cases deal with if as if it had been 
seized by the police and the Seizure had been reported to 
him in the manner hereinafter mentioned.   
 
10. 
Though section 104 of Cr.P.C. authorizes the Court to 
impound any document or thing yet during the trial and after 
conclusion it can decide the fate of such property including 
destruction, confiscation and delivery to person entitled. When the 
accused, during the trial claims the property as his own, then on 
acquittal he is entitled to receive it back straightaway by the order 
of trial Court but when the situation is otherwise then Court must 
decide the question again by providing opportunity to prove the 
entitlement and also reason for disowning of such property during 
the trial and Court can presume any fact while deciding application 
for claim. Section 517 of Cr.P.C. in that case provides jurisdiction 
to Court to decide all questions arising out of acquittal order. This 
section is somewhat like section 47 of CPC which says that all 
questions arising between the parties to the suit in which the decree 
was passed and relating to the execution, discharge or satisfaction 
of the decree shall be decided by the Court executing the decree 
and not by a separate suit. Similarly, as sections 379, 425 and 442 
of Cr.P.C., say that all orders passed by Court of Reference, 
Appeal and Revision shall be certified to the lower Court which 
shall pass orders confirmable to the judgment and order of the 
High Court and if necessary, record shall be amended in 
accordance with law. Thus, in this way lower Court becomes an 
executing Court like one under section 47 of CPC, therefore, can

     Criminal Revision No.31115 of 2021 
     Criminal Revision No.27750 of 2021 
 
 
 
decide all ancillary question relating to case property in accordance 
with law.    
11. 
With these observation, present revision petitions are 
allowed, impugned order dated 27.03.2021 is set aside, matter is 
remanded to learned Special Judge (Central) Lahore to decide the 
application of the petitioners again within two months positively 
after perusal of record and by providing opportunity of hearing to 
both the parties.
