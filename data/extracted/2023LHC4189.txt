Respondent No.2 by:

MUHAMMAD RAZA QURESHI, J. Through this Civil Revision, 
the Petitioner has challenged the Judgments and Decrees dated 
24.10.2013 and 24.04.2015 passed by the learned Trial Court and the 
learned Appellate Court respectively pursuant whereto Suit for specific 
performance of agreement to sell filed by Respondent No.1 was 
conditionally decreed by the learned Courts below.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the Impugned 
Judgments and Decrees are illegal and unlawful as both the learned 
Courts below failed to advert that the Respondent No.1 failed to 
produce witnesses of the subject matter agreement to sell. According to 
learned counsel, his failure to produce the witnesses of the subject 
matter agreement to sell was fatal as by non-production of attesting 
witnesses the subject matter agreement to sell never stood proved in 
terms of Articles 17 and 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. 
Additionally, learned counsel submits that present Petitioner is 
bonafide purchaser of the subject matter property from the Respondent 
No.2 who was impleaded as the Defendant No.1 in the Suit and had 
denied the execution of the subject matter agreement to sell. According 
to learned counsel, the Impugned Judgments and Decrees are nullity in 
the eyes of law and both the learned Courts below by passing the same 

-2- 
Civil Revision No.1432 of 2015  
 
have committed material illegality. Lastly, submits that though the 
Impugned Judgments and Decrees are concurrent in their nature and 
scope but there is sufficient material floating on the surface to establish 
that by the error of law committed by the learned Courts below and on 
account of misreading and non-reading of evidence, this Court may 
interfere in the Impugned Judgments and Decrees in its supervisory 
jurisdiction. In support of his contentions, learned counsel has relied 
upon judgments reported as “Nazir Abbas through L.Rs v. Ghulam 
Muhammad through L.Rs” (2017 CLC 996), “Qasim Ali v. Khadim 
Hussain through Legal Representatives and others” (PLD 2005 
Lahore 654), “Nazim-ud-Din and others v. Sheikh Zia-ul-Qamar and 
others” (2016 SCMR 24) and “City Education Board (Rgistered) 
Sialkot through Director v. Mst. Maqbool Nasreen”   (PLD 2008 
Lahore 51).  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel appearing for Respondent 
No.1/Plaintiff submits that he filed a Suit seeking specific performance 
of agreement to sell dated 15.07.2007 and also challenged the transfer 
of Suit property in favour of the Petitioner who was impleaded in the 
Suit as Defendant No.2. According to learned counsel, the subject 
matter agreement to sell was written on a plain paper and was adduced 
in evidence as Exh.P.1. The attesting witnesses of this agreement to 
sell were Muhammad Aslam, Ameer Hussain and Nazir Ahmad 
whereas the scribe of this document was Muhammad Abid. 
Respondent No.1/Plaintiff Ahmad Din himself appeared as PW-1 
whereas Muhammad Abid appeared as PW-2 and two witnesses of the 
subject matter agreement to sell namely Nazir Ahmad and Ameer 
Hussain appeared as PW-3 and PW-4, therefore, according to learned 
counsel, the contention of the Petitioner is misconceived that 
Respondent No.1 failed to produce attesting witnesses as well as scribe 
of the subject matter agreement to sell. Learned counsel has also 
assisted this Court that Respondent No.2/vendor though filed written 
statement and claimed the subject matter agreement to sell as bogus 
but nowhere denied his signatures thereon. Upon framing of issues, the 

-3- 
Civil Revision No.1432 of 2015  
 
said vendor failed to appear in the witness box to subject himself to 
cross-examination to be conducted by Respondent No.1 being Plaintiff. 
According to learned counsel the Impugned Judgments and Decrees 
were never challenged by the vendor and those have only been 
challenged by the Petitioner who appeared as DW-1 and deposed 
hearsay evidence as he had nothing to do with the subject matter 
agreement to sell. According to leaned counsel, infact the Petitioner’s 
case is a case of no evidence and he has no legal entitlement to claim 
himself a bonafide purchaser. Lastly contends that the condition 
imposed by the learned Trial Court for depositing balance sale 
consideration of Rs.30,000/- within 15 days has already been complied 
with by the Respondent No.1 and according to learned counsel, this 
Civil Revision is liable to be dismissed.  
4. 
No one is present on behalf of Respondent No.2/vendor, thus, 
he is proceeded exparte.  
5. 
Arguments of the learned counsel for the parties have been 
heard and record has been perused with their able assistance. There is 
no cudgel to the legal position that it is not mandatory that an 
agreement to sell be written or printed on a stamp paper as the law 
fully acknowledges even an oral agreement. It is equally correct that in 
case of non-appearance of attesting witnesses to an agreement to sell, 
the contents and existence of said document cannot be proved in terms 
of Article 17 read with Article 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 which is mandatory.  
6. 
To evaluate the concurrent findings contained in the Impugned 
Judgments and Decrees, it is imperative to identify whether the 
Respondent No.1 being Plaintiff fulfilled the mandatory conditions to 
prove his case. It is also essential to identify the effect of contesting 
written statement filed by Respondent No.2 being Defendant 
No.1/vendor and consequence of his failure to appear in the witness 
box.  

-4- 
Civil Revision No.1432 of 2015  
 
7. 
Upon divergent pleadings of the parties, the learned Trial 
Court framed as many as 5 issues. Respondent No.1 appeared as PW-1 
and produced subject matter agreement to sell as Exh.P1 and deposed 
that Nazir Ahmad, Ameer Hussain and Muhammad Aslam signed the 
document as marginal witnesses. The Respondent No.1/Plaintiff also 
deposed that his son Muhammad Abid was scribe of the subject matter 
agreement to sell. The attesting witnesses as well as the scribe 
appeared as PW-2 to PW-4 whose examination-in-chief is found 
consistent and it has been observed by this Court that during cross-
examination, the Petitioner failed to impeach or discredit the testimony 
of said witnesses. Therefore, through oral evidence and by producing 
scribe and marginal witnesses the Respondent No.1/Plaintiff 
discharged his onus as to existence and contents of the subject matter 
agreement to sell.  
8. 
The actual dent caused to the case of the Petitioner was due to 
non-appearance of Respondent No.2 being vendor in the witness box. 
Article 129(g) of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 permits the 
Court to draw an adverse inference against the party who fails to 
appear in the witness box. Reliance in this regard is placed upon 
“Naveed Akram and others v. Muhammad Anwar” (2019 SCMR 
1095), “Shamir through Legal Heirs v. Faiz Elahi, through Legal 
Heirs” (1993 SCMR 145) and “Fateh Muhammad through L.Rs and 
others v. Fida Hussain Shah through L.Rs” (2007 CLC 1885). 
Therefore, no matter how strong the written statement filed by 
Respondent No.2/vendor was, it lost its efficacy as he did not make 
himself available for the cross-examination, and his written statement 
could not have been treated as substantive piece of evidence. The sole 
evidence of the Petitioner is inconsequential as whatever he deposed 
was hearsay.   
9. 
Another angle to analyze the status of the Impugned 
Judgments and Decrees is that same were never challenged by the 
vendor i.e. Respondent No.2, therefore, to his extent these Judgments 
and Decrees have attained finality. A challenge by a subsequent 

-5- 
Civil Revision No.1432 of 2015  
 
purchaser would be hit by the principle of lis-pendens. Such purchaser 
would sink and sail with the vendor and does not have a locus standi to 
take up cudgels for and on behalf of the defendant or the vendor. 
Reliance in this regard is placed upon “Muhammad Sahrif and others 
v. Mst. Fateh Bano and others” (2004 SCMR 813).  
10. 
The attack on the subject matter agreement to sell by the 
Petitioner that it has no sanctity in the eyes of law is also ill-foundedly 
premised. In this case at maximum, the subject matter agreement to 
sell was on a simple paper or insufficiently stamped paper. Under the 
law a contract can be in writing or oral and oral agreement would be 
valid and enforceable just like a written agreement provided it fulfills 
the requirements of valid agreement. Reliance in this regard is placed 
upon “Bashir Ahmad v. Muhammad Yousaf through Legal Heir” (1993 
SCMR 183). Therefore, the argument of the Petitioner is meritless that 
the agreement to sell being written on a simple paper has no sanctity in 
the eyes of law. 
11. 
In this case, the Respondent No.1 being Plaintiff discharged 
his onus by appearing in the witness box personally and producing 
attesting witnesses as well as a scribe. Conversely, the vendor/ 
Respondent No.2 failed to present himself for cross-examination and 
this was fatal to the case of the Petitioner as well as Respondent No.2. 
The appearance of the vendor in written box was also imperative as 
Respondent No.1/Plaintiff in his evidence had placed on record the 
criminal proceedings as Exh.P.4 to Exh.P.6 and said proceedings were 
decided in his favour. Therefore, the failure of the Respondent 
No.2/vendor to appear in witness box and depose to rebut the evidence 
of the Respondent No.1/Plaintiff has serious consequences as under the 
law it amounts to admission. The deposition of the Petitioner being 
subsequent purchaser about the subject matter agreement to sell was 
just hearsay as he was not in a position to depose with respect to the 
existence and contents of the subject matter agreement to sell.  

-6- 
Civil Revision No.1432 of 2015  
 
12. 
In such facts and circumstances, this Court in the light of 
judgment reported as “Bashir Ahmad v. Muhammad Yousaf through 
Legal Heir” (1993 SCMR 183) is convinced that the concurrent 
findings contained in the Impugned Judgments and Decrees cannot be 
disturbed as by passing the same neither the learned Courts below have 
committed any illegality nor same are tainted with any material 
irregularity.  
13. 
Despite hectic efforts of the learned counsel for the Petitioner, 
this Court is not persuaded that the Impugned Judgments and Decrees 
warrant any interference and consequently, this Civil Revision is 
dismissed with no order as to costs.
