Ahmad, caste Kharal, resident of 229/RB Maku Ana; dark brown charas 
wrapped in yellow solution tape from a blue coloured polythene bag 
caught by her in her right hand was recovered; same was weighed on 
computerized scale and found as charas weighing 1500-grams; 75-grams 
charas was separated as sample for getting chemical analysis whereas 
remaining case property was also secured; both parcels with the stamp of 
K.K. were prepared and taken into possession through recovery memo.  
 
 
After investigation, challan report was sent to the Court against 
the appellant; charge was framed against her, to which she pleaded not 
guilty; prosecution produced its evidence. Trial court recorded statement 
of the appellant under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. wherein she refuted 
allegations leveled against her, then trial court after hearing learned 
counsel for the parties, passed the impugned judgment, whereby 
appellant was convicted and sentenced as mentioned above. 
 
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that safe custody 
of case property has not been proved therefore conviction recorded and 
sentence awarded through impugned judgment is liable to be set aside; 
further requested for acceptance of instant appeal. 
 
4. 
Conversely learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by 
learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor has supported the impugned 
judgment and requested for dismissal of this appeal. 
 
5. 
After hearing learned counsel for the appellant, learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by learned Deputy District 
Public Prosecutor and going through the record, it has been noticed 
that as per case of prosecution mentioned in the fard bian (فرد بیان) of 
complainant (Exh.PB), on 22.12.2022, Kaleem Ullah Khan, ASI (PW-1) 
got recovered charas weighing 1500-grams from the appellant, 75-grams 
charas was separated as sample for getting chemical analysis, sample 
and remaining case property were secured through parcels in the 
presence of Shabana Khalid, 4930/LC (PW-4) and Amjad Yasin, 
6107/HC (PW-6), who both witnesses attested the recovery memo 
(Exh.PA), which was prepared by Kaleem Ullah Khan, ASI (PW-1); 
similarly, Kaleem Ullah Khan, ASI (PW-1) clearly deposed in his 
statement before the court that he recovered 1500-grams charas from the 
appellant and out of the same, 75-grams was separated for forensic 
analysis, two parcels were prepared and taken into possession vide 

Crl. Appeal No.40132/2023

recovery memo (Exh.PA) which was attested by Amjad Yasin 6107/HC 
and Shabana Khalid, 4930/LC; Zia Ullah/Investigating Officer came at 
the spot and he (complainant) handed over accused and two sealed 
parcels to him; relevant portions of his statement are as under:- 
“Stated that on 22.12.2022, I was posted at P.S 
Khurrianwala. On the same day I alongwith Amjad Yasin 6107-HC, 
Zahid Farooq 4916-C, Shabana Khalid 4930-LC was present at              
by pass Chowk 229 R.B Makuana.” 
 
“After sometime of establishing picket, a lady was coming towards 
main road on foot who on seeing police party tried to run back she 
was apprehended on suspicion who afterwards disclosed her name 
Shahida Bibi. Upon her personal search by lady constable Charas 
Exh.P1 was recovered from the blue colored shopping bag wrapped 
in yellow tape which she was holding in her right hand. Recovered 
Charas was weighed on electronic scale and was found 1500 grams 
out of which 75 grams Charas was separated for forensic 
examination. Two sealed parcels were prepared with the stamps 
KK. The same was taken into possession vide recovery memo 
Exh.PA which was attested by Amjad Yaisn 6107-HC and Shabana 
Khalid-LC. I drafted complaint Exh.PB and same was sent by 
Amjad Yasin to the police station for registration of FIR. Zia ullah 
I.O came at the place of occurrence who on our pointation 
prepared unscaled site plan and recorded the statement of 
witnesses. I handed over to him custody of the accused two sealed 
parcels and recovery memo.” 
 
 however, Shabana Khalid, 4930/LC (PW-4) during her statement before 
the court categorically deposed that recovered charas was weighed at 
electronic scale, which was found as 1500-grams, out of which,75-grams 
charas was separated for sample parcel, Investigating Officer (I.O.) 
sealed both the parcels with the stamp K.K. and were taken into 
possession vide recovery memo (Exh.PA) and the same were attested by 
her and Amjad Yaseen; further deposed that thereafter Investigating 
Officer (I.O.) prepared complaint and handed over the same to Amjad 
Yaseen to take it to the police station for registration of the FIR; relevant 
portion of her statement is hereby reproduced as under: - 
 
“It was weighed on electronic scale and was found to be 1500 gram 
out which 75 gram charas was separated for sample parcel.  I.O. 
sealed both the parcels with the stamp Κ.Κ and were taken into 
possession vide recovery memo Exh-PA and the same were 
attested by me and Amjad Yaseen. Thereafter I.O prepared 
complaint and handed over the same Amjad Yaseen to take it to 
the police station for registration of the FIR.” 
       
 
 
 
 
       (emphasis added) 
 
It is relevant to mention here that Shabana Khalid, 4930/LC (PW-4) 
further deposed during cross-examination before the court that Moharrir 

Crl. Appeal No.40132/2023

called her from police station for the purpose of arrest of Shahida; 
relevant portion of her statement is also hereby reproduced as under: - 
 
“Muharrar called me from police station for purpose of arrest of 
Shahida.” 
 
                                                                    (emphasis added) 
 
 
whereas as per case of prosecution, it was claimed through fard bian       
(فرد  بیان/Exh.PB) that she (PW-4) was accompanying the police party 
when Shahida (present appellant) was apprehended. It is relevant to 
mention here that she{Shabana Khalid (PW-4)} was neither re-examined  
nor questions were put to her on aforementioned points by the 
prosecution under Article 150 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, 
meaning thereby that aforementioned portions of her said statement were 
not denied/negated rather admitted by the prosecution. So, on the one 
hand securing and safe custody of parcel of sample as well as parcel of 
remaining case property has been compromised whereas on the other 
hand registration of case after preliminary inquiry/investigation is also 
reflecting on the record.  
Perusal of the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore  
(Ex.PE) reveals that parcel of sample was received there on 26.12.2022 
from Kaleem Ullah Khan, ASI however Moharrir namely Rashid Ali, 
5849/MHC while appearing in the witness box as PW-5 has clearly 
deposed during cross-examination that on 26.12.2022, he handed over 
the sample parcel to Kaleem Ullah Khan, ASI at 6/6:15 p.m.; relevant 
portion of his statement is reproduced as follows: - 
“On 26.12.2022, I handed over the sample parcel to Kaleem Ullah 
ASI, at 6/6.15 pm.” 
 
and he was neither re-examined nor asked question under Article: 150 of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 on this point. Undoubtedly, this case 
pertains to District Faisalabad whereas Punjab Forensic Science Agency 
is situated in Lahore where parcel of sample was deposited and question 
does arise that if it (parcel of sample) was handed over by Moharrir to 
Kaleem Ullah, ASI on 26.12.2022 at 6/6.15 p.m., then how said parcel 
was received on the same day i.e. on 26.12.2022 in the office of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore but learned Prosecutor could not refer 
any material to answer said question and this mystery could not be 
resolved which has also compromised the safe transmission of parcel of  
sample to Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. Nutshell is that safe 

Crl. Appeal No.40132/2023

custody of parcel of case property as well as parcel of sample has not 
been proved.  
Now law is well settled on the point that unbroken chain of safe 
custody of “allegedly recovered case property and parcel of sample” is to 
be proved otherwise, conviction is not possible and it is rightly so 
because recovery of narcotics is not a mere corroboratory piece of 
evidence rather it constitutes the offence itself and entails punishment. 
Guidance in this regard has been sought from the case of “The STATE 
through REGIONAL DIRECTOR ANF versus IMAM BAKHSH” 
(2018 SCMR 2039); relevant portion whereof is being reproduced 
below: - 
“Chain of Custody – Safe custody and safe transmission 
9. 
We have noted above that in Criminal Appeals Nos.523 
to 525/2017 and No.22/2018, safe custody and safe 
transmission of the alleged drug from the spot of recovery till 
its receipt by the Narcotics Testing Laboratory are not 
satisfactorily established.  The chain of custody begins with 
the recovery of the seized drug by the Police and includes the 
separation of the representative sample(s) of the seized drug 
and their dispatch to the Narcotics Testing Laboratory.  This 
chain of custody, is pivotal, as the entire construct of the Act 
and the Rules rests on the Report of the Government Analyst, 
which in turn rests on the process of sampling and its safe and 
secure custody and transmission to the laboratory.  The 
prosecution must establish that the chain of custody was 
unbroken, unsuspicious, indubitable, safe and secure.  Any 
break in the chain of custody or lapse in the control of 
possession of the sample, will cast doubts on the safe custody 
and safe transmission of the sample(s) and will impair and 
vitiate the conclusiveness and reliability of the Report of the 
Government Analyst, thus, rendering it incapable of 
sustaining conviction.  This Court has already held in Amjad 
Ali v. State (2012 SCMR 577) and Ikramullah v. State (2015 
SCMR 1002) that where safe custody or safe transmission of 
the alleged drug is not established, the Report of the 
Government Analyst becomes doubtful and unreliable.

Laboratory” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         (emphasis added) 
 

Crl. Appeal No.40132/2023

In this regard, guidance has also been sought from the case of “ABDUL 
GHANI and others versus The STATE and others” (2019 SCMR 
608); relevant portion whereof is reproduced as under:- 
“There is hardly any occasion for discussing the merits of the 
case against the appellants because the record of the case 
shows that safe custody of the recovered substance as well as 
safe transmission of samples of the recovered substance to the 
office of the Chemical Examiner had not been established by 
the prosecution in this case. Nisar Ahmed, S.I./SHO 
complainant (PW1) had stated before the trial court that he 
had deposited the recovered substance at the Malkhana of the 
local Police Station but admittedly the Moharrir of the said 
Police Station had not been produced before the trial court to 
depose about safe custody of the recovered substance. It is 
also not denied that Ali Sher, H.C. who had delivered the 
samples of the recovered substance at the office of the 
Chemical Examiner had also not been produced during the 
trial so as to confirm safe transmission of the samples of the 
recovered substance. It has already been clarified by this 
Court in the cases of The State through Regional Director 
ANF v. Imam Bakhsh and others (2018 SCMR 2039), 
Ikramullah and others v. The State (2015 SCMR 1002 and 
Amjad Ali v. The State (2012 SCMR 577) that in a case where 
safe custody of the recovered substance or safe transmission of 
samples of the recovered substance is not proved by the 
prosecution through independent evidence there it cannot be 
concluded that the prosecution had succeeded in establishing 
its case against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. The 
case in hand suffers from the same legal defects. This appeal 
is, therefore, allowed, the convictions and sentences of the 
appellants recorded and upheld by the courts below are set 
aside and they are acquitted of the charge by extending the 
benefit of doubt to them. They shall be released from the jail 
forthwith if not required to be detained in connection with any 
other case.”     
(emphasis added) 
 
Further guidance has also been sought from the cases of  
“MUHAMMAD HAZIR versus The STATE” (2023 SCMR 986), 
“ASIF ALI and another versus The STATE through Prosecutor 
General Punjab” (2024 SCMR 1408) and “SARFRAZ AHMED 
versus The STATE” (2024 SCMR 1571). Since safe custody of the 
allegedly recovered charas and sample taken out of it, has not been proved 
in this case therefore report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
(Exh.PE) is inconclusive and cannot be made basis for conviction. By 
now it is also well settled that if safe custody of allegedly recovered 
substance or parcel of sample/case property has not been proved then it 
straightaway leads to the acquittal of the accused; in this regard, 
guidance has been sought from the dictum laid down by the Supreme 

Crl. Appeal No.40132/2023 
7
Court of Pakistan in the supra cases of “Abdul Ghani and others versus 
The State and others” and “The State through Regional Director ANF 
versus Imam Bakhsh”. 
Furthermore, for recording conviction and awarding sentence in a 
criminal case, it is mandatory to put entire incriminating material to the 
accused under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. in order to have his explanation/ 
reply in said regard otherwise it would amount to “audi alteram partem” 
and  in this regard, case of  “AMEER ZEB versus THE STATE” (PLD 
2012 Supreme Court 380) can be safely referred and its relevant portion 
from Page No.398 available at Paragraph No.6, is hereby reproduced for 
ready reference:- 
“It is trite that a piece of evidence not put to the accused person 
at the time of recording of his statement under section 342, 
Cr.P.C. cannot be used against him by the prosecution.” 
 
 
 
 
 
      (emphasis added) 
 
It goes without saying that in this case, Shabana Khalid, 4930/LC                     
(PW-4) deposed in categorical terms that parcel of the sample and parcel 
of case property were prepared, sealed and taken into possession by the 
Investigating Officer and he (Investigating Officer) also prepared the 
complaint and then handed over the same (complaint) to Amjad Yasin 
whereas in the question No.2 under Section: 342 Cr.P.C., 
aforementioned material was not put to the accused rather preparation 
and taking into possession of said parcels by Kaleem Ullah Khan, ASI as 
well as preparation of complaint by said ASI has been asked through 
said question;  relevant portion of the same is hereby reproduced below:- 
“Two sealed parcels were prepared with stamp KK, one for sample 
parcel and other for remaining bulk case property were taken into 
possession vide recovery memo Ex.PA, by said ASI. Complainant 
Kaleem Ullah Khan ASI, prepared the complaint Ex.PB and handed 
over the same to Amjad Yaseen for taking the same to the police 
station for registration of the FIR.”  
 
This state of affairs also goes against the prosecution.  
 
 
6.   
It is trite law that single dent in case of prosecution is sufficient for 
acquittal, in this regard, reliance can be placed upon the cases of 
“MUHAMMAD MANSHA versus The STATE” (2018 SCMR 772), 
“ABDUL 
JABBAR 
and 
another 
versus 
The 
STATE”                      
(2019 SCMR 129), “Mst. ASIA BIBI versus The STATE and others” 

Crl. Appeal No.40132/2023 
8
(PLD 2019 SC 64) and “AMIR MUHAMMAD KHAN versus The STATE” 
(2023 SCMR 566). 
7. 
Outcome of the above discussion is that prosecution has been failed 
to prove its case against the appellant beyond shadow of doubt hence there 
is no need to discuss defence version.   
8. 
Resultantly, instant appeal is allowed/accepted, conviction 
recorded and sentence awarded to Mst. Shahida Bibi (appellant) through 
the impugned judgment dated: 18.05.2023 passed in case arising out of 
F.I.R No.1631/2022 dated: 22.12.2022 registered under Section: 
9(1)(3)(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 at Police 
Station: Khurrianwala, District Faisalabad, are hereby set aside; she is 
acquitted of the charge and will be released from jail forthwith if not 
required in any other case.
