Mr. Muhammad Irfan Khan Ghaznavi, Advocate for 
the petitioner. 
 
 
 
  Through present petition, filed under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner has assailed judgment 
dated 19.09.2023 passed by the learned Additional 
District Judge Lahore and order dated 22.02.2023 
passed by the learned Civil Judge, Lahore. 
2.  
Brief facts of the case are that on 
12.06.2021 respondent No. 1 filed suit titled “Mst. 
Sumaira Adnan versus Awais Gohar” for possession 
through partition with respect to the property as 
described in the suit (the „suit property‟). On 
22.02.2023 the learned trial Court declared that the 
internal auction has failed and started proceedings for 
the external auction. The said decision was assailed 
by the petitioner before the learned Additional 
District Judge, Lahore through civil revision No. 96 
of 2023, which was dismissed vide judgment dated 
19.09.2023. Aggrieved from the same, present 
petition has been filed by the petitioner.  
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner has 
argued that the learned two Courts below have fell to 

 
 
 
 
            W.P. No. 65237-2023                                                               2 
 
 
 
an error while ignoring section 10(4) of the Punjab 
Partition of Immovable Property Act, 2012 (the 
„Act‟), which provides that the co-owners of 
immovable property can submit their written offers 
or counter offers; that internal auction has been 
declared as unsuccessful in haste and without 
observing the requirement of law. He has further 
submitted that section 10(2) of the Act permits the 
representation through authorized agent at the stage 
of internal auction and when passing order dated 
22.02.2023 it went unnoticed that the learned counsel 
of the petitioner was present on the given date of 
hearing. 
4.  
Heard. The documents available on the file 
have been perused. 
5. 
The learned trial Court passed order for 
holding internal auction, after reaching to the 
conclusion that there is no dispute as to the 
ownership of the suit property. In pursuance to 
section 10(2) of the Act, the parties were directed to 
appear in person. On 18.05.2022 evaluation report of 
the suit property was submitted and the petitioner 
was directed to appear on 31.10.2022, when the 
respondent-lady remained present but the petitioner 
failed to appear. The case was once again fixed on 
the same day at 11:30 a.m. with the direction to the 
petitioner to appear but he neglected to obey the 
Court‟s order. Thereafter, the learned trial Court 
fixed the case for 23.12.2022 for the purposes of 
internal auction and personal appearance of the 
parties. On the said date the learned Court was 

 
 
 
 
            W.P. No. 65237-2023                                                               3 
 
 
 
apprised that petitioner is out of the city and 
adjournment was sought by the learned counsel for 
the petitioner. Then on 24.01.2023 it was stated 
before the Court that the petitioner is suffering from 
COVID-19. The petitioner again failed to appear on 
27.01.2023 or to make any offer or statement through 
his authorized agent for the progress of internal 
auction. This was followed by a specific direction to 
the petitioner to appear on 06.02.2023 but in vain.   
6.  
These 
adjournments 
continued 
till 
22.02.2023 when once again the petitioner instead of 
appearing before the Court produced a copy of some 
revision-petition and the learned trial Court was 
informed that the petitioner is out of the Country. 
Ultimately, on 22.02.2023 after perusing the record 
and in view of the conduct of the petitioner, the 
learned trial Court concluded that the petitioner is not 
interested in the internal auction and closed 
proceedings relating to internal auction by declaring 
the same as unsuccessful. 
7. 
Section 11(1) of the Act reads as follows: -  
If the co-owners refuse to participate in 
the internal auction or only one co-
owner 
shows 
his 
willingness 
to 
participate in such auction or the 
internal auction under section 10 has 
failed, the Court shall fix the reserve 
price of the immovable property and 
direct open auction of the property. 
 
 
 
                             (Emphasis Supplied) 
8.  
Perusal of the above reflects that if the co-
owners refuse to participate in internal auction or 
only one co-owner shows willingness to participate 

 
 
 
 
            W.P. No. 65237-2023                                                               4 
 
 
 
in such auction and other(s) are not willing or when 
the internal auction under section 10 of the Act has 
failed, then the Court can proceed with open auction 
and fix the reserve price. In the present case, the 
learned trial Court initiated the proceedings for 
internal auction, under section 10 of the Act but the 
petitioner failed to appear or to make any offer for 
the progress in the internal auction. He continued to 
be absent from the learned Court and his learned 
counsel kept seeking adjournments on one or the 
other pretext between 19.04.2022 to 22.02.2023.  
9.  
Section 14 of the Act provides specific 
period of six months to complete the proceedings in 
such suits from their date of institution. The present 
suit was filed on 12.06.2021. The process of internal 
auction was initiated on 19.04.2022 and the petitioner 
has already gained about nine months for making a 
suitable offer or properly assisting the learned Court 
in the proceedings of internal auction or show 
willingness to participate. By various means and 
adopting different tactics the petitioner defeated the 
very purpose of the Act which has been enacted for 
the purposes of expeditious partition of immovable 
properties and to provide remedy for ancillary 
matters. As already discussed, section 11(1) of the 
Act clearly commands to further proceed with the 
open auction when (i) co-owners refuse to participate 
in internal auction or (ii) only one co-owner shows 
his willingness to participate or (iii) internal auction 
under section 10 of the Act fails. The respondent-lady 
throughout the proceedings kept appearing, whereas, 

 
 
 
 
            W.P. No. 65237-2023                                                               5 
 
 
 
the petitioner has even avoided to appear in person 
and his lawyer has shown no interest in the progress 
of the case or the internal auction.   
10.  
In the Chambers Dictionary (12th Edition) 
the word “willing” is defined as „eager, co-operative, 
ready and prompt to act; voluntary; chosen; 
intentional‟. As per Oxford Advanced Dictionary 
(10th Edition) the word “willingness” means „ready to 
do something‟. In case titled “Ms. Sara Bibi versus 
Muhammad Saleem and others” (PLD 2021 
Islamabad 236), it has been already observed that 
the word “willingness” also denotes the conduct of a 
relevant party. However, instead of taking any 
prompt action or to willingly participate in the 
proceedings, the petitioner remained extremely 
disinclined. His conduct has shown that he was not 
prepared or ready for the internal auction. He kept 
wasting the time of the learned trial Court and caused 
delay of about 9 months in just one step of the case 
(i.e. internal auction), entirely contrary to the intent 
of legislature reflected from the preamble and section 
14 of the Act.      
11.  
Today, 
the learned counsel for the 
petitioner has relied upon an air ticket to show that 
on the given day the petitioner was in Dubai. This air 
ticket does not reflect any actual travel but just the 
booking. The petitioner has not even bothered to 
provide record of his entry in Dubai up to this third 
forum. It is important to observe that the case was 
fixed for personal appearance in the Court when the 
petitioner was present in the Country but instead of 

 
 
 
 
            W.P. No. 65237-2023                                                               6 
 
 
 
appearing in the Court, he allegedly left the Country 
for few days, without pleading any emergency or 
assigning valid reason. Even if the stance of the 
petitioner is correct that he went to Dubai, in the 
absence of assigning any emergency or reasonable 
explanation to leave the Country in defiance of the 
Court order, is not acceptable. The overall conduct of 
the petitioner, starting from 18.05.2022 to 22.02.2023 
is not such that any leniency can be shown. In this 
long time period numerous opportunities were given 
to him to appear before the Court. In utter disregard 
of the same, not just the petitioner failed to appear 
but at the same time no „willingness’ or intent is 
shown to participate in the internal auction. 
12.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner has failed 
to convince that the learned two Courts below have 
not adhered to the law, thus, the decisions assailed do 
not require any interference. Consequently, this 
petition is dismissed in limine. No order as to costs.
