interest of the petitioners/defendants, by stating that Ghulam 
Qadir was a Qadiani by faith (disbeliever) as such he could not 
inherit the property from the estate of his deceased Muslim 
father. The subsequent mutations got entered by Ghulam Qadir

dated 20.2.2009 are against law, facts and are inoperative 
upon the rights of the plaintiff? OPP

Arguments heard. Record perused. 
4. 
In this case, two questions are required to be answered: 
i. Whether a non-Muslim is entitled to inherit share from 
the estate of his Muslim Relative/father? 

 
C.R.No.3843/2014 
 
3
ii. Whether Article 260 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is applicable retrospectively?  
Tahir Mehmood, one of the petitioners/defendants appeared as 
D.W.1 and during his cross examination he admitted that his 
father Ghulam Qadir was a Qadiani and deposed as under: 
"
 یہ 
 درتس ےہ ہک ریمے وادل اصبح ادمحی رفہق ےک اریم ےھت۔ ہی درتس ےہ ہک ریمے وادل
 اصبح بج وفت
وہےئ وت ان وک انچب رگن ںیم دنف ایک ایگ۔ ہی درتس ےہ ہک ریمے انان الغم اقد ر 
 ادمحی ےھت۔ ہی درتس ےہ ہک ادمحویں  اور املسمونں یک ابعدت اگںیہ اگؤں ںیم دحیلعہ دحیلعہ ںیہ۔" 
 
It is an admitted position that Ghulam Qadir, predecessor-in-
interest of the petitioners/defendants, was a Qadiani by faith and 
while incorporating the inheritance mutation of a Muslim namely 
Natho, predecessor-in-interest of the parties of the lis, he did not 
disclose to be a Qadiani (non-Muslim). It is settled law that 
admitted facts need not to be proved. Reliance is placed on the 
cases of Mst. Nur Jehan Begum through LRs v. Syed Mujtaba Ali 
Naqvi (1991 SCMR 2300) and Mst. Rehmat and others Vs. Mst. 
Zubaida Begum and others (2021 SCMR 1534). But this fact of 
conversion of Ghulam Qadir as Qadiani (disbeliever) was not 
disclosed at the time of sanctioning of the impugned inheritance 
mutation. It is settled law of Shariah that the estate left by a 
deceased Muslim owner cannot be inherited by a Non-Muslim 
heir. For reference in this regard, a Hadith of Hazrat Muhammad 
(ﷺ) from Sahih Muslim is reproduced as under: 
“23. The Book of the Shares of Inheritance  
[4140] 1 – (1614)  It was narrated from Usamah bin Zaid that 
the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “A Muslim does not inherit from a 
disbeliever and a disbeliever does not inherit from a Muslim. 
[Sahih Muslim : Volume No.4, Published by Darussalam, 
English translation by Nasiruddin al-Khattab]” 
 
Further in the British Rule the Personal Laws of the respective 
communities dwelling in India were protected through 

 
C.R.No.3843/2014

promulgation of legislated law. Similarly the Muslim Personal 
Laws were also made applicable to the Muslims through Muslim 
Shariat Application Act, 1937. Section 2 whereof is as under:- 
2.Application of Personal Law to Muslim.-Notwithstanding 
any custom or usage to the contrary, in all questions (save 
questions relating to special property of females, including 
personal property inherited or obtained under contract or gift 
or any other provision of Personal Law, marriage, dissolution 
of marriage, including talaq, ila, zihar, lian, khula and 
mubarat maintenance, dower, guardianship, gifts, trusts and 
trust properties, and wakfs other than charities and charitable 
institutions and charitable and religious endowments the rule 
of decisions in cases where the parties are Muslims shall be 
the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat)  
Thereafter Shariat Application Act, 1948 was also promulgated 
which also affirms application of Muslim Personal Law (Quran & 
Sunnah) upon the Muslims. This concise and considered view is 
that canon of Quran and Sunnah are applicable to inheritance of 
the estate of a deceased Muslim.  
 
In view of above, the first question framed above is 
answered in manner that a non-Muslim is not entitled to inherit 
any share from the estate of his Muslim relative as successor or 
predecessor.  
5. 
As regard second question that whether provisions of 
Article 260(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 are applicable retrospectively. Ghulam Qadir was 
Qadiani at the time of entry of inheritance mutation of his 
father/Natho in the year 1954 as admitted by D.W.1, and this 
material fact was not disclosed by him at the time of 
incorporation of inheritance mutation of Natho, who was a 
Muslim by faith, as such the said amendment simply affirm the 
Qadianis as non-Muslims and declared the position as it existed 
under Shariat as such, the said amendment being declaratory 
operates retrospectively. Reliance in this regard is placed on a 
case cited Muhammad Ashraf and 2 others Vs. Mst. Niamat Bibi 

 
C.R.No.3843/2014 
 
5
and 2 others (PLD 1981 Lahore 520) the relevant portion 
whereof is reproduced as under: 
 “29. While construing Article 260(3), according to the well-
established rule of construction of the statute and the 
Constitutional Provisions, it will be the duty of the Court to 
find out the real aim, scope and object of amending Act. 
According to the Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 10th 
Edition, page 18:- 
 “….. To arrive at the real meaning, it is always 
necessary to get an exact conception of the aim, scope, 
and object of the whole Act; to consider, according to 
Lord Coke. (1) What was the law before the Act was 
passed; (2) What was the mischief or defect for which the 
law had not provided; (3) What remedy Parliament has 
appointed; and (4) The reason of remedy…” 
As stated earlier the Muslims of the Sub-Continent have all 
along been agitating that Qadianis be declared non-Muslims. It 
was in obedience to the demand of the Muslim Ummah that 
the Constitution was amended for this purpose. It is to be 
noticed that he who does not believe in the absolute and 
unqualified of Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon 
him), has always been outside the fold of Islam. As such the 
Constitution (Second Amendment) Act, 1974, simply affirmed 
and declared the position as it existed under Shariat. The 
amending Act is thus a declaratory Act. It was also held so by 
this Court in Abdur Rehman Mobashir v. Amir Ali Shah.” 
 
Thus, in view of above, it can conveniently be answered 
that the provisions of Article 260(3) of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 are applicable retrospectively.   
6. 
In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the 
case when it was established that Ghulam Qadir, predecessor-in-
interest of the petitioners/defendants, was a Qadiani at the time of 
incorporation of inheritance mutation of Natho whereas his father 
Natho was a Muslim as such Ghulam Qadir was not entitled to 
inherit from the estate of his Muslim father, Natho as such the 
trial Court rightly decreed the suit of the respondents/ plaintiffs 
which decision was lawfully upheld by the appellate Court. 
7. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners has not pointed out any 
illegality or material irregularity in the impugned judgments & 

 
C.R.No.3843/2014

decrees passed by the Courts below and has also not identified 
any jurisdictional defect. The concurrent findings of fact are 
against the petitioners which do not call for any interference by 
this Court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction in absence of 
any illegality or any error of jurisdiction. Reliance is placed on 
the case titled as Mst. Zaitoon Begum v. Nazar Hussain and 
another (2014 SCMR 1469). 
8. 
In view of above, this civil revision being devoid of any 
merit is dismissed. No order as to costs.
