Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – On 9.5.2023, Pakistan  
Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers took to the streets across the country to 
protest against the arrest of the party Chairman. They turned violent, 
blocked roads, battled with law enforcement agencies and caused 
extensive damage to public and private property. To quell the situation, 
the Deputy Commissioners issued preventive detention orders under 
section 3(1) read with section 26 of the Maintenance of Public Order 
Ordinance, 1960 (MPO), against various people in their respective 
districts. FIRs were also registered for breaches of law against 
nominated and unidentified accused.

The Petitioners were initially detained under the MPO. 
Their detention order was subsequently revoked, but the police arrested 
them under section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
(Cr.P.C.), suspecting that they were actively involved in the agitation 
and wanted in one of the FIRs registered as aforesaid. On 25.5.2023, the 
police produced the Petitioners before Respondent No.2 (Magistrate 
Section-30, Multan) requesting her for their test identification parade 
(“TIP”) under Rule 26.32 of the Police Rules 1934 and Volume III, 
Chapter 11, Part-C of the Lahore High Court Rules & Orders. 
Respondent No.2 sent them to the New Central Jail Multan and asked 
the Investigating Officer to obtain a date from the competent court 
within three days for holding their identification test. She further 
directed him to bring the Petitioners back before her on 8.6.2023. The 
Petitioners claim that they were not involved in the incidents of 9th May 
and seek this Court’s indulgence under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) for an early 
holding the TIP so that they can begin the procedures for their release. 
The Petitioners allege that the Government is deliberately delaying the 
TIP to keep them imprisoned. 
3. 
 
The Assistant Advocate General has vehemently denied any 
wrongdoing on the part of the administration. He states that the 9th May 
incidents were unprecedented in the country’s history. The people who 
took to the streets that day were in large numbers, and many were 
arrested. There is a long waiting list for the TIP, and the Petitioners will 
be summoned when their turn comes.

Every human being has the right to be treated with dignity 
and to have his liberty and security respected. Other individual rights 
become increasingly vulnerable, if not illusory, without an adequate 
guarantee for human freedom and security.1 In Siddharam Satlingappa 
Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra and others (AIR 2011 SC 312), the 
Indian Supreme Court stated that “life bereft of liberty would be

and Lawyers, Chapter 5, p.161.

without honour and dignity, and it would lose all significance and 
meaning, and the life itself would not be worth living. This is why 
‘liberty’ is called the quintessence of civilized existence.” 
6. 
 
The international human rights law recognizes the 
importance of the right to liberty and security and guarantees it.2 
Nevertheless, it also understands that it cannot be absolute. Therefore, all 
human rights treaties declare, albeit in a slightly different language, that 
any constraint on liberty must be in all instances under the law (the 
principle of legality), and it must not be arbitrary. Regarding the 
principle of legality, the Human Rights Committee has held that “it is 
violated if an individual is arrested or detained on grounds which are not 
clearly established in domestic legislation.” In other words, the grounds 
for arrest and detention must be “established by law”.3 The Committee 
has interpreted the meaning of the phrase “arbitrary arrest” in Article 
9(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 
as follows:  
“… ‘arbitrariness’ is not to be equated with ‘against the law’, but 
must be interpreted more broadly to include elements of 
inappropriateness, injustice, lack of predictability and due process of 
law ... [T]his means that remand in custody pursuant to lawful arrest 
must not only be lawful but reasonable in the circumstances. Remand 
in custody must further be necessary in all the circumstances, for 
example, to prevent flight, interference with evidence or the 
recurrence of crime”.4 
7. 
 
According to the Human Rights Committee, liberty of 
person refers to freedom from bodily restraint rather than universal 
freedom of action. Security of person concerns freedom from injury to 
the body and the mind, often known as physical and mental integrity. 
Deprivation of liberty involves a more severe restriction of motion 
within a limited space than mere interference with the freedom of 
movement. Examples of deprivation of liberty include police custody, 
remand detention, imprisonment after conviction, house arrest, 
                                          
2 For instance, see Articles 3 & 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, Article 9 (1) of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), 1966, Article 6 of the African 
Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, 1981, Article 5 of the European Convention on Human 
Rights, 1950, Article 7 of the American Convention on Human Rights, 1969. This right is also 
recognized in the Arab Charter on Human Rights, the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration, and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

administrative detention, and involuntary hospitalization. It also includes 
cases where a person already incarcerated is subjected to further 
restrictions, such as solitary confinement or physical restraint devices. 
Deprivation of personal liberty occurs without free consent. If an 
individual goes to a police station voluntarily to participate in an 
investigation and knows he is free to leave at any time, he is not being 
deprived of his liberty.5 
8. 
 
The Human Rights Committee further explains that “arrest” 
refers to any apprehension of a person that starts a deprivation of liberty. 
In contrast, “detention” refers to a loss of liberty that begins when the 
individual is apprehended and continues until his release. An arrest does 
not have to be formal. When a person who is already in prison is 
subjected to another deprivation of liberty, such as incarceration on 
unrelated criminal charges, the beginning of that deprivation also 
constitutes an arrest.6 In Mohammed-Holgate v Duke (1984) [1 All ER 
1054], while interpreting the word “arrest” in section 2 of the Criminal 
Law Act 1967, Lord Diplock stated that “it is a term of art. First, it 
should be noted that arrest is a continuing act; it starts with the arrester 
taking a person into his custody (by action or words restraining him from 
moving anywhere beyond the arrester’s control), and it continues until 
the person so restrained is either released from custody or, having been 
brought before a magistrate, is remanded in custody by the magistrate’s 
judicial act.” In Ch. Muhammad Anwar v Government of West 
Pakistan (PLD 1963 Lahore 109), a Full Bench of this Court stated that 
the essence of custody is that there should be a lack of freedom to move 
about as one wishes coupled with a physical power immediately 
available to prevent an attempt to break the restraints specified, as 
opposed to the power afterwards to punish for a breach of these 
restrictions. If a person is ordered not to go beyond certain boundaries, 
but there is no physical impediment or threat of physical force to ensure 
that he does not go outside those boundaries, there would be no

confinement and no custody, even though that person may be liable to be 
punished in due course of law if he does go out. On the other hand, if 
someone is told not to cross particular boundaries, and he observes or is 
informed that physical force will be used to stop him if he does, his 
confinement or custody is not different from that of a person held in jail. 
There is merely a difference in magnitude. This view was followed in 
Muhammad Aslam v. Province of West Pakistan (PLD 1968 Lahore 
1324) and Begum Nazir Abdul Hamid v Pakistan (PLD 1974 Lahore 7). 
9. 
 
In the Hostages in Tehran case, the International Court of 
Justice stated that “wrongfully to deprive human beings of their freedom 
and to subject them to physical constraint in conditions of hardship is in 
itself incompatible with the principles of the Charter of the United 
Nations, as well as with the fundamental principles enunciated in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 3 of which guarantees 
‘the right to life, liberty and security of person’.”7 
10. 
 
Arrest has far-reaching ramifications for the accused, his 
family, and, in certain cases, the entire community. In Siddharam 
Satlingappa Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra and others (AIR 2011 SC 
312), the Indian Supreme Court stated that great ignominy, shame and 
disgrace are associated with it. Most people do not differentiate between 
pre-conviction and post-conviction arrests. The Supreme of Pakistan 
expressed similar views in Salman Rafique and another v. National 
Accountability Bureau and others (PLD 2020 SC 456) and added that 
the power to arrest must be exercised with caution, prudence, and 
sensitivity. It should not be used to oppress or harass anyone. A person’s 
arrest must be justified by referring to prima facie evidence and adequate 
actionable material sufficiently linking him with the alleged offence and 
by demonstrating that no other less intrusive or restrictive means were 
available in given circumstances. 
11. 
 
International human rights law has a particular concern 
about pre-trial detention. Though definitions may vary, this term 
signifies the period during which the State detains a person while

awaiting trial to determine whether he is innocent or guilty of a crime.8 
The person could be at the “pre-court” (or the investigation stage) or an 
under-trial prisoner. Its repercussions are more serious than post-
conviction custody. The Indian Supreme Court mentioned some of them 
in Moti Ram and others v. State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1978 SC 
1594). It stated: 
“The consequences of pre-trial detention are grave. Defendants 
presumed innocent are subjected to the psychological and physical 
deprivations of jail life, usually under more onerous conditions than 
are imposed on convicted defendants. The jailed defendant loses his 
job if he has one and is prevented from contributing to the preparation 
of his defence. Equally important, the burden of his detention 
frequently falls heavily on the innocent members of his family.” 
12. 
 
The most painful aspect of pre-trial detention is that it 
benefits the person who is found guilty when criminal litigation 
concludes rather than the one who is determined innocent. On the proof 
of guilt, an accused may be compensated for his suffering and distress by 
deducting the duration of custody from the sentence imposed by the 
court’s final verdict. As a result, when an accused is convicted and 
sentenced to imprisonment, the period of pre-trial detention may not 
bring him any additional harm. However, if the accused is ultimately 
acquitted, then the entire episode of pre-trial detention remains solely as 
a trauma, anguish and stigma for him, besides the financial and social 
costs he has suffered.9 
13. 
 
Despite its serious repercussions, international law and 
domestic legal systems recognize pre-trial detention as an unavoidable 
measure. The stated justification is that it safeguards other people’s 
rights through evidence protection, proper investigation and unhindered 
trial. It also prevents further violation of law and human rights and 
ensures the accused’s presence during the investigation and trial 
process.10 Nonetheless, according to international legal standards, pre-
trial detention is exceptional. Rule 6.1 of Tokyo Rules, 1990, states that 
“pre-trial detention shall be used as a means of last resort in criminal

proceedings, with due regard for the investigation of the alleged offence 
and for the protection of society and the victim.” Rule 6.2 requires that 
alternatives to pre-trial detention should be employed as early a stage as 
possible. Pre-trial detention must not last longer than necessary to 
achieve the objectives outlined in Rule 6.1. It must be administered 
humanely and with respect for the inherent dignity of human beings. 
(Bail, release on recognizance and release under supervision are 
alternatives to pre-trial detention). The UN Human Rights Committee, 
while interpreting Article 9(3) of the ICCPR, has stated that pre-trial 
detention is an ‘exception rather than a rule’.11 
14. 
 
The Constitution of Pakistan (1973) contains several 
provisions relating to the sanctity and protection of the people’s life, 
liberty and dignity. Article 4 states that every citizen, wherever he may 
be, and every other person for the time being in Pakistan, has an 
inalienable right to enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in 
accordance with the law. In particular, no action detrimental to any 
person’s life, liberty, body, or reputation shall be taken except in 
accordance with the law. Article 9 mandates that no person shall be 
deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with the law. Article 10 
provides safeguards against arbitrary and unlawful arrest and detention. 
Article 10A guarantees the right to a fair trial. Article 14 declares that 
the dignity of man is inviolable.  The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, 
is the main statute that deals with the procedures relating to arrest and 
detention, including pre-trial detention, under the framework of the 
Constitution. 
15. 
 
Chapter V of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, relates 
to arrest, escape and retaking. Section 54 Cr.P.C. provides that any 
police officer may, without an order from a Magistrate and a warrant, 
arrest any person who has been concerned in any cognizable offence or 
against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible 
information has been received or a reasonable suspicion exists of his 
having been so concerned. Section 55 Cr.P.C. pertains to arrest of 
vagabonds, habitual robbers etc. Section 60 Cr.P.C. states that when a

police officer arrests a person without a warrant, he shall immediately 
take or send him to the Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case or to 
the officer-in-charge of a police station. Section 61 Cr.P.C. stipulates 
that no police officer shall detain a person arrested without a warrant for 
more than twenty-four hours (excluding the time necessary for the 
journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate’s court), and section 62 
Cr.P.C. mandates that every arrest must be reported to the designated 
authorities. Section 63 Cr.P.C. talks of the discharge of the person 
apprehended.12 
16. 
 
Section 167 Cr.P.C. ordains that if police cannot complete 
the investigation into the alleged offence within twenty-four hours after 
arresting an accused, they shall present him with the relevant record 
before the nearest Magistrate and seek his remand. A Magistrate, 
regardless of whether he has jurisdiction in the case, can remand the 
accused in police custody for a maximum period totalling fifteen days if 
the circumstances warrant. If Magistrate lacks jurisdiction to try the case 
or send it for trial, and considers the accused’s further detention is 
unnecessary, he may order him to be forwarded to the Magistrate having 
the jurisdiction. When an accused is not discharged or granted bail, he is 
sent to judicial lock-up to await trial. 
17. 
 
Section 169 Cr.P.C. empowers the police officer 
investigating a case to release an accused from custody if he finds that 
the evidence against him is insufficient and direct him to appear before 
the competent Magistrate when required, provided he executes a bond 
with or without sureties. This is a salutary provision. It may, however, be 
observed that even when the police officer has released an accused as 
aforesaid, the court may summon him to face trial. Section 170 Cr.P.C. 
authorizes the officer-in-charge of a police station to obtain security 
from an accused in any bailable offence to appear before a Magistrate 
without first arresting him. 
                                          
12 Discharge does not amount to cancellation of a case which is dealt with by Rule 24.7 of the Police 
Rules, 1934. Cancellation terminates further investigation by the police while the discharge does not. 
In the event of discharge, the FIR remains alive. The police may associate a discharged accused with 
investigation at any subsequent stage, but if his arrest is required formal permission from the 
Magistrate should be obtained.

Section 344 Cr.P.C. authorizes the trial court to remand the 
accused for up to fifteen days at a time during the trial. Although the law 
emphasizes that a case should be adjourned only for a “reasonable” time 
and aims to avoid unnecessary delay and adjournments to ensure quick 
decisions, a criminal prosecution sometimes takes very long. 
19. 
 
Rule 25.2(2) of the Police Rules 1934 states that  
“no avoidable trouble shall be given to any person from whom enquries 
are made and no person shall be or unnecessarily detained.” Rule 26.1 
clarifies that the authority given to the police under section 54 Cr.P.C. to 
arrest without a warrant is permissive and not obligatory. Rules 26.2 and 
26.9 provide further guidelines to the police officers involved in criminal 
investigations, requiring them not to interfere with the suspects’ liberty 
“until the investigation is sufficiently complete” and “the facts justify 
arrest”. According to Rule 26.1, the facts necessitating an immediate 
arrest may include the possibility of the suspect evading justice or an 
inconvenient delay that will result in the police failing to arrest him. 
20. 
 
A learned Single Judge of this Court considered section 54 
Cr.P.C. in Abdul Qayyum v. SHO, Police Station Shalimar, Lahore 
(1993 PCr.LJ 91), and held that it must be construed strictly because the 
powers granted to police officer encroach upon a person’s liberty. The 
Supreme Court approved this view in Ghulam Abbas v. The State  
(1999 SCMR 944). It further stated that it was impossible to define 
“reasonable” in section 54 Cr.P.C. However, there must be some 
concrete legal evidence upon which the police officer can form an 
opinion as to whether it is sufficient to establish the reasonableness and 
credibility of the charge, information or suspicion. 
21. 
 
Article 22 of Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984 says that the facts 
which establish the identity of anything or any person whose identity is 
relevant are admissible in a court of law. TIP is an investigation tool 
used by the police to help identify the offender if there was a witness. It 
involves lining the suspect of a crime with individuals (dummies) who 
match his description. A witness is then called upon to identify the 
culprit among those present. The TIPs are usually undertaken when the 
accused is unknown to the witnesses, and they catch his fleeting glimpse. 

Writ Petition No. 9139/2023 
 
 
 
- 10 -
The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, do 
not specify the procedure for holding the TIPs. However, Volume III, 
Chapter 11, Part-C of the Lahore High Court Rules & Orders, and Rule 
26.32 of the Police Rules 1934 give some guidelines which must be 
followed. The Supreme Court of Pakistan elaborated them in Azhar 
Mehmood and others v. The State (2017 SCMR 135); Hakeem and 
others v. The State (2017 SCMR 1546); Mian Sohail Ahmed and 
others v. The State and others (2019 SCMR 956) and In Re: Kanwar 
Anwar Ali (PLD 2019 SC 488 : PLJ 2019 SC (Cr.C.) 153].13 It is 
pertinent to point out that the TIP has only corroborative value and is not 
a substantive piece of evidence. Furthermore, the court must carefully 
examine the identification evidence according to the criteria elucidated 
by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the above-mentioned cases. 
22. 
 
The TIP is also important from the accused’s point of view. 
It checks against false implications and becomes necessary when the 
culprits are not nominated.14 
23. 
 
Currently, the procedure from the stage when an accused or 
suspect is apprehended until the TIP is conducted is mostly governed by 
practice. Generally, the Sessions Judge designates the judges and 
magistrates under him for various categories of cases. He gives 
responsibility for the TIPs to one or more Judicial Magistrates (JM) or 
Special Judicial Magistrates (SJM), depending upon the workload and 
the number of police stations in his jurisdiction. After arresting the 
accused, the Investigating Officer takes him to the Area Magistrate and 
requests that he may be sent to judicial lock-up and kept there for the 
TIP. The Area Magistrate grants the request routinely and directs the Jail 
Superintendent to keep the accused isolated from other prisoners. He 
also sets a date for production of the accused after TIP proceedings, 
which is normally between seven to fourteen days. Thereafter, the 
Investigating Officer applies to the assigned JM/SJM for fixing a date 
for the TIP, which he does according to his roaster. If more than one

sufficient legal knowledge.

JM/SJM is designated for the TIPs, the Investigating Officer files an 
application before the Sessions Judge, who marks it to one of them and 
then fixes the date for the TIP. If the complainant and witnesses appear 
before him on the scheduled date, the JM/SJM completes the 
proceedings and sends the case file in a sealed envelope to the Sessions 
Judge; otherwise, he sets another date. When the TIP is done, the 
Investigating Officer produces the accused before the Area Magistrate 
for further proceedings. 
24. 
 
The Special Courts/Anti-Terrorism Court follows a slightly 
different procedure. When an accused, for example, is arrested in a 
terrorism-related FIR and his TIP is required, the Investigating Officer 
brings him before the Judge, who remands the accused in judicial 
custody. He further directs the Investigating Officer to request the 
Sessions Judge for the TIP. The Sessions Judge assigns the application 
to any of the designated JM/SJM, who then follows the procedure 
outlined in the preceding paragraph. 
25. 
 
Evidently, the current practice for the TIPs is inefficient. 
The delay in conducting the test following the accused’s arrest also 
compromises the credibility of the procedure. Therefore, the courts insist 
that it should be conducted as early as possible after the arrest of the 
accused.15 Besides causing unnecessary hardship to the accused, such 
delays impact his fundamental rights to liberty, dignity, due process and 
a fair trial. In Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah v. The State (PLD 2022 SC 
261), the Supreme Court ruled that depriving the accused person of his 
liberty and freedom even for a single day is unconscionable and below 
human dignity. It follows that justice should be served even while an 
investigation is ongoing. 
26. 
 
The constitutional courts are the guardian of the 
Constitution. They are required to review the executive actions and the 
conduct of the public authorities on the touchstone of fairness, 
reasonableness and proportionality.16 It is necessary to issue the

following directives to actualize the rights guaranteed to the accused 
under Articles 4, 9, 10, 10A and 14 of the Constitution:  
i. 
In all cases where the Area Magistrate commits an 
accused to jail for the TIP, he shall immediately 
forward a copy of his order to the Sessions Judge. He 
shall fix it as a “TIP Case” in his cause list to ensure 
the accused is produced before him after the TIP. 
ii. 
If, for any reason, the Magistrate who sends an 
accused to jail for the TIP is not the Area Magistrate, 
he shall also forward a copy of his order to him.   
iii. 
Immediately on receipt of a copy of the Magistrate’s 
order as aforesaid, the Sessions Judge shall depute a 
JM/SJM for holding the TIP, who shall direct the 
Investigating Officer to take the requisite steps and 
conclude the exercise within 48 hours. 
iv. 
If the Sessions Judge has designated a JM/SJM in any 
area for the TIPs, he shall direct him, or if he is not 
available for any reason, depute another JM/SJM for 
holding the TIP. Such JM/SJM shall also conclude 
the exercise within 48 hours.  
v. 
If the TIP is not done within 48 hours as aforesaid, 
the JM/SJM shall bring the matter to the notice of the 
Sessions Judge and the Police Head concerned. If he 
finds any delinquency or dereliction of duty by the 
Investigating Officer, he shall also recommend action 
against him. In any case, the JM/SJM shall ensure the 
TIP is held the next day.

In the present case, the Petitioners have been awaiting the 
TIP since 25.5.2023. Although Respondent No.2 directed the 
Investigating Officer to get a date from the competent court within three 
days for the TIP, he has not done so. The Petitioners face further delays 
that infringe on their constitutional rights discussed above. Therefore,
