Revision-petitioners by: 
Mr. 
Ghulam 
Rasool 
Chaudhary, learned Advocate 
Respondents No. 3 and 4  
by: 
Mr. Salman Asif Warraich, 
learned Law Officer  
Respondents No. 1(i) to 
1(iii) and 2(i) to 2(iv): 
Ex-parte vide order dated 
18.09.2025 
 
           Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:- This civil revision was 
instituted inter-alia on the grounds of misreading / non-
reading of evidence, failure to give finding on each issue by 
the learned Appellate Court and alleging that the finding on 
issue No. 4-A is based on surmises and conjectures. 
However, on 16.10.2025 and 06.11.2025 the learned counsel 
for the revision-petitioners opted not to press any other 
ground and stated that due to death of Muhammad Yousaf, 
some further land in concerned khata was inherited by 
Muhammad Younis / the seller, therefore, benefit of section 
43 of the Transfer of Property Act-1882 (the „Act‟) should 
be given to the revision-petitioners. He has relied upon case 
titled “Noora (deceased) through L.Rs. versus Province of 
Punjab and others” (2025 YLR 566). 
2.  
 I have heard the arguments and gone through 
the record.  
3.  
 The revision-petitioners filed suit dated 
03.12.1998, for declaration and permanent injunction, with 
averments that they have paid Rs. 150,000/- as consideration 
for 7-kanals 06-marlas land (the „suit land‟) to Muhammad

Younis, possession of the suit land was delivered to them 
and mutation No. 1424 dated 28.05.1995 was correctly 
incorporated in their favour; that this mutation was wrongly 
reviewed by the Deputy Commissioner, without hearing 
them. In the written statement, it is alleged that the mutation 
No. 1424, over and above 3-kanals 17-marlas land, is the 
result of a fraud.  
4.  
 It is admitted position that Muhammad 
Younis-deceased was owner of 3-kanals 17-marla by way 
of inheritance and acquired share in 1-kanal 5-marlas 
through successful claim of pre-emption (total 4-kanals and 
6-marlas) at the time of alleged sale. The remaining land fell 
to the share of his brother and sisters. The payment of 
alleged consideration of Rs.150,000/- for 7-kanals 06-
marlas land is denied in written statement as well as by the 
witnesses of the defendants / respondents. The possession of 
revision-petitioners also remained disputed. Muhammad 
Yousaf-deceased (DW-1) deposed that the land over and 
above 3-kanals and 17-marlas was never sold. He also 
stated that the possession is still with him.  
5.  
 Muhammad Younis / the seller appeared as 
DW-2. Questions were put to him regarding payment of full 
consideration of Rs. 150,000/- for the suit land. Hardly any 
favourable answer could be extracted. He in his 
examination-in-chief stated that he never appeared before 
the Tehsildar.  
6.  
Muhammad Munir-plaintiff appeared as PW-1. 
He failed to produce any witness to support him as to 
payment of Rs.150,000/- as consideration. Revenue Officer, 
lambardar, patidar or any other person from the village 
could not be produced to depose in his favour. 
7.  
 The 
learned 
trial 
Court 
summoned 
Muhammad Asif-patwari (CW-1), whose signatures are 
alleged on Ex.P-8. He deposed that Ex.P-8 is bogus and his 
signatures thereupon are falsely attributed to him. He further 

 
Civil Revision No. 41-2009

stated that mutation No. 1424 in favour of the revision-
petitioners is incorrect. The record was produced by him, 
negating the assertions of revision-petitioners of possession 
over 7-kanals 6-marlas. 
8.  
 The claim on the basis of section 43 of the Act 
can only be justified on proof of payment of consideration. 
This important element of consideration was not proved 
with the required degree of cogency. Reproducing the 
following extract from judgment in case titled “Nabi Ahmed 
Shah versus Mirwaiz Muhammad Abdullah and others” 
(1976 SCMR 132) will be beneficial:-  
         “As regards the petitioner's reliance on 
section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act, we find 
that the same is not attracted to the facts of this 
case. This section comes into play where a person 
fraudulently or erroneously represents that, he is 
authorized to transfer certain immovable property 
and professes to transfer such property for 
consideration, then such transfer shall, at the 
option of the transferee, operate on any interest 
which the transferor may acquire in such property 
at any time during which the contract of transfer 
subsists. Now, it will be seen that the respondent 
had not made any fraudulent or erroneous 
representation to the present petitioner; on the 
contrary in first round of litigation the present 
petitioner was fully associated with the respondent 
but the petitioner then gave up and the respondent 
was left to pursue the litigation alone. There was 
no proof on the record that the petitioner had paid 
any consideration to the respondent, and on this 
ground also section 43 could not be invoked.” 
                                           (Emphasis supplied) 
9.  
The Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
case titled “Rab Nawaz and others versus Muhammad Ali 
through Legal Representative” (2007 SCMR 1120) has 
set-aside a judgment of this Court which was also 
reported as “Muhammad Ali versus Rabnawaz and 14 
others” (2001 YLR 1282). However, paragraph No. 6 of 
the judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court reflects 
that payment of consideration was an admitted fact. 
Likewise, case titled “Haji Abdul Ghafoor Khan through 
Legal Heirs versus Ghulam Sadiq through Legal Heirs” 

 
Civil Revision No. 41-2009 
 
 
 
4 
(PLD 2007 Supreme Court 433) is also based on certain 
proven facts.  
10.  
 The learned counsel for the revision-
petitioners has referred to “Noora-deceased” case (supra) 
but he has ignored that in the case this Court has laid 
down the principle that equity favours the claimant who 
has paid the price. In the present case the bargain, 
genuineness of revenue record and consideration 
remained disputed, therefore, judgment referred is not 
applicable to the facts of the present case.  
11.  
 The learned trial Court while deciding issue 
No. 4-B observed:- 
“…..However, plaintiffs have right to claim the 
excess amount allegedly paid by them regarding 
share of the land which defendant No. 1 was not 
competent to sell out and for this purpose, they 
can avail independent remedy if permissible 
under the law….” 
  
 The revision-petitioners have not availed the 
indicated remedy or sought to prove payment of excess 
amount. This is the position uptil now. Section 43 of the 
Act incorporates the doctrine known as feeding of 
estoppel. Learned counsel for the revision-petitioners has 
failed to establish from the record that any excess 
payment was made by the revision-petitioners.  
12.  
 As per process server report, Muhammad 
Younis (the alleged seller) has also passed away. 
Permitting to further maintain this civil-revision, in the 
absence of proof of excess payment, will be inequitable, 
unfair and unjust. I am fully satisfied that the relief sought 
by the learned counsel for the revision-petitioners cannot 
be granted. This revision-petition is, therefore, dismissed, 
without any order of cost.
