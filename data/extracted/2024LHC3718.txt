revision-petitioners. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Through this civil petition, filed under 
section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure-1908, 
the revision-petitioners have challenged judgment 
and decree dated 03.07.2024 passed by the learned 
Additional District Judge, Nankana Sahib as well as 
judgment and decree dated 06.03.2024 passed by 
the learned Civil Court, Nankana Sahib. 
2.   
The facts, necessary for decision of the 
present civil revision, are that revision-petitioners 
No. 2 to 7 are sons and daughters of Umar Hayat-
deceased from his second marriage with revision-
petitioner No. 1 (Mst. Shamim Bibi alias Seema 
Bibi). The respondents are children of Umar Hayat-
deceased from his first marriage with one Mst. 
Nawab 
Bibi-deceased. 
The 
respondent-side 
instituted suit dated 25.05.2021 titled “Zakir 
Hussain and others versus Mst. Seema Bibi alias 
Naseem and others” for declaration, permanent

2 
injunction and cancellation regarding the property 
as detailed in the suit (the ‘suit property’), with the 
averments that on 21.08.2019 it was learnt by the 
respondents that a gift mutation No. 195 dated 
30.01.2014 (the ‘gift mutation’) is reflected as 
sanctioned in favour of revision-petitioners No. 2 
and 3, which is against the law and it is outcome of 
fraud; that Umar Hayat-deceased was suffering 
from various diseases in 2014, when the gift 
mutation was sanctioned and then he passed in the 
same year. The suit was contested and this resulted 
into framing of the following issues:- 
 
 
1.  
Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get the 
decree for declaration that they are owners 
in possession of the suit property and gift 
mutation No. 195 dated 30.01.2014 is false, 
frivolous, based on fraud and liable to be 
cancelled? OPP 
 
2.  
If issue No. 1 is decided in affirmative, 
whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get a 
decree 
for 
permanent 
injunction 
that 
respondents be restrained from alienating the 
suit property till the final decision of the suit 
property? OPP 
 
3.  
Whether the suit of the plaintiffs is within 
time? OPP 
 
 
4.      Relief? 
             The parties led their respective evidence. 
The learned trial Court in its judgment dated 
06.03.2024 gave issue-wise findings and decreed 
the suit while granting the following relief:- 
 “…As sequel to my findings on above 
said issues, instant suit of the plaintiffs is 
hereby decreed and mutation No. 195 
dated 30.01.2014, is hereby cancelled…” 
 
 
3.   
The revision-petitioners filed civil appeal 
No. 22 of 2024, which was dismissed vide judgment  

 
C. R. No. 49020 of 2024 
 
 
3 
 
and decree dated 03.07.2024. Being aggrieved from 
the same, the present civil petition has been filed. 
 
4.   
Mr.  Ihsan Ali Arif, learned counsel for 
the revision-petitioners has submitted that the 
learned two Courts below have misread the 
evidence; that khasra gardawri reflecting the 
possession of revision-petitioners No. 2 and 3 has 
been ignored. It is vigorously argued that the learned 
trial Court has even wrongly recorded the age of 
Umar Hayat-deceased at the time of his death; that 
the learned trial Court has noted the age of Umar 
Hayat-deceased as 80 years, whereas, the same was 
about 60 years at the time of death and this shows 
that the learned Courts below have failed to properly 
appreciate the record; that the issue of limitation is 
also wrongly decided. 
 
5.   
Heard. 
 
6.   
Record reflects that Zakir Hussain / 
respondent No. 1 appeared as PW-1 and his 
examination-in-chief is in harmony with his 
pleadings. He deposed that in the year (2014) when 
the gift mutation was incorporated Umar Hayat-
deceased was suffering from severe ailments and 
then he died on 13.09.2014; soon thereafter the 
revision-petitioners got busy in their routine matters 
and normal business activities; that in the year 2019 
they visited the revenue computer center and on 
probe it was unearthed that the gift mutation has 
been incorporated. Shaukat son of Akbar Ali (PW-2) 
also deposed similarly. Whereas, Shakir Ali, 

 
C. R. No. 49020 of 2024 
 
 
4 
Muhammad Arshad (the beneficiaries of the gift) 
and Noor Ahmad, one of the witness of the gift 
mutation, have not entered into the witness box. 
Revenue officer was not produced, either. 
 
7.   
The learned trial Court has observed that 
Shakir Ali and Muhammad Arshad remained present 
in the Court during the proceedings but even then 
they have not opted to depose in their favour and by 
doing the same they have withheld best piece of 
evidence. Learned counsel for the revision-
petitioners in order to justify the same has stated that 
Shakir Ali and Muhammad Arshad were minors at 
the time of gift. Even then at the time of institution 
of suit and when the proceeding was being 
conducted the said two revision-petitioners had the 
capacity to give evidence. Their witness / DW-1 
admitted that on 17.10.2023 (i.e. when the case was 
in the process of adducing evidence) the said 
revision-petitioners were above eighteen years and 
both were married.  
 
8.   
One of the crucial dispute remained 
regarding the possession, being an important 
ingredient of gift. There was no impediment for the 
said two revision-petitioners to enter in the witness-
box and depose as to this ingredient. In case titled 
“Muhammad Hussain Deceased through L.Rs and 
others versus Muhammad Ali through L.Rs. and 
others”(2022 CLC 1973), the following has already 
been observed by this Court:- 
“…In the present case, the defendant 
No.1 
was 
the 
beneficiary 
of 
the 
transaction but he did not appear as his 

 
C. R. No. 49020 of 2024 
 
 
5 
own witness to substantiate the stance 
stated by him in his written statement 
and 
also 
to 
prove 
the 
essential 
ingredients 
of 
gifts, 
and 
his 
two 
witnesses, that is, DW-2 and DW-3 
though stated in their statements that Taj 
Din had told them that he wanted to give 
his land to defendant No.1, but both the 
witnesses did not say that Taj Din ever 
declared that he had given his land as a 
gift to defendant No.1. So, the conclusion 
would be that there was no evidence of 
declaration of gift by Taj Din or its 
acceptance by defendant No. 1…” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
9.   
PW-1 and PW-2 specifically deposed that 
the possession of the suit property was never given 
to revision-petitioners No. 2 and 3.  In course of 
cross-examination hardly any relevant question, to 
contradict this part of the evidence, was asked. 
Learned counsel for the revision-petitioners has 
relied upon Ex.D-1, the khasra gardawri. He 
referred to page No. 31-A of this file, however, 
reading of the same reflects that Umar Hayat-
deceased is reflected in possession of the suit 
property. When confronted, learned counsel stated 
that some part of the khasra gardawri could not be 
appended with this civil petition. It is observed that 
even the learned two Courts below, after thorough 
examination of Ex. D-1 (the khasra gardawri) and 
other documents, have reached to the conclusion 
that Umar Hayat-deceased is reflected in possession 
up-till the trial stage. 
10.  
Learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
revision-
petitioners has also pointed out some discrepancies 
including incorrectly mentioning of the age of 

 
C. R. No. 49020 of 2024 
 
 
6 
Umar Hayat-deceased at the time of his death, 
contrary to the death certificate, by the learned trial 
Court. This alleged mistake apparently is result of 
the statement of witness of revision-petitioners 
(DW-2), who deposed that Umar Hayat-deceased 
was eighty (80) years when he died. The two 
witnesses of the respondent-side have stated the 
correct age, thus, no benefit can be given to the 
revision-petitioners for this alleged discrepancy, 
which originally is introduced by their witness. It is 
an admitted fact that the gift mutation and the death 
of Umar Hayat-deceased pertains to same year. The 
witnesses 
of 
the 
revision-petitioners 
have 
themselves conceded as to the health condition of 
Umar Hayat-deceased in that year.  
11.  
Learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
revision-
petitioners also tried to explain that gift was given 
to Shakir Ali and Muhammad Arshad (revision-
petitioners No. 2 and 3) in lieu of some cash 
compensation to the respondents and he stated that 
the legal heirs from the first wife are not deprived 
from their inheritance rights. There is no proof of 
giving any cash compensation. DW-1 though stated 
that cash compensation was given but in her cross-
examination she admitted that she never witnessed 
such fact, thus, this part of evidence is based on 
hearsay, having no evidentiary value. 
12.  
Learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
revision-
petitioners has stated that the learned trial Court 
was under obligation to look into the question of 
limitation without this being raised. He relied 

 
C. R. No. 49020 of 2024 
 
 
7 
upon“Yousuf 
versus 
Muhammad 
Akbar 
and 
others”(2024CLC 1085). This argument can hardly 
help the revision-petitioners as the learned Courts 
below remained mindful about this settled law. As a 
matter of fact, the learned trial Court has framed 
issue No. 3 in this regard. The date and mode of 
knowledge about the gift mutation is pleaded in the 
plaint. To prove the same specific evidence has 
been led. PW-1 clearly deposed as to mode and 
manners in which he learnt about the gift mutation 
in the year 2019. The revision-petitioners have not 
even asked a single question to the witness vis-à-vis 
this part of examination-in-chief or any question 
regarding the issue relating to limitation. DW-1, 
DW-2 and other witnesses from the defendant-side 
have not even uttered a word with respect to this 
issue. The question of knowledge and limitation, in 
the circumstances, remained a mixed question of 
law and facts. The evidence of respondents went 
totally un-rebutted. This part of evidence is also 
supported by the circumstances of the case. The 
principle is well settled that where on a material 
and related part of evidence a witness is not cross-
examined the same can lead to inference of truth of 
such part of the statement. Reference in this regard 
can be made to case titled “Mst. Nur Jehan Begum 
through Legal Representatives versus Syed Mujtaba 
Ali Naqvi”(1991 SCMR 2300). It will be beneficial 
to reproduce the following extract from the said 
judgment: - 
“…The principle enunciated in the 
commentaries and rulings is that whereon 

 
C. R. No. 49020 of 2024 
 
 
8 
a material part of his evidence a witness 
is not cross-examined it may be inferred 
that the truth of such statement has been 
accepted. Statement of a witness which is 
material to the controversy of the case 
particularly when it states his case and 
the same is not challenged by the other 
side directly or indirectly, then such 
unchallenged statement should be given 
full credit and usually accepted as true 
unless displaced by reliable, cogent and 
clear evidence.” 
 
  
 
(Underlining is added) 
 
13.  
After reading the record and hearing the 
learned counsel, I have reached to the conclusion 
that no case of wrong exercise of jurisdiction or 
material irregularity is made out. The minor 
discrepancies relied by revision-petitioners are not 
enough to disturb the concurrent findings of the 
learned two Courts below. This revision-petition, 
therefore, is dismissed in limine. No order as to 
costs.
