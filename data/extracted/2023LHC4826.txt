AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J.  This Civil Revision is 
directed against the concurrent judgments and decrees dated 
29.03.1992 & 12.04.1997 of learned Courts below, whereby, the suit 
of the respondents/plaintiffs for declaration was decreed with some 
modification.  
 
2. 
 
Shorn of unnecessary details, the facts required to be 
brought on record are that respondents/plaintiffs (hereinafter referred 
to as the plaintiffs) instituted a suit for declaration on 15.06.1989 
against the petitioners/defendants (hereinafter referred to as the 
defendants) and sought declaration that they are owners to the extent 
of 5/24 shares in land situated at Khewat No.29/39/190 to 199, 
khatoni No.154 to 163, measuring 238 kanals 01 marla in Chak 
No.144/EB, Tehsil Burewala, District Vehari and the inheritance 
mutation No.82 dated 24.01.1975 of their maternal grandmother 
namely Mst. Alam Khatoon is against facts and law, result of fraud

and misrepresentation and the sale deed dated 14.09.1981, executed 
on the basis of said mutation in favour of the defendants to the extent 
of their share, is void, ineffective and having no effect upon their 
rights and also prayed for issuance of permanent injunction with 
regard to the suit property. The plaintiffs based their contention on 
the ground that 1/3rd out of the total land measuring 238 kanals 01 
marla was allotted to one Jam (their maternal grandfather) by the 
Provincial government in “Dakheel-Kari-Scheme” and after his 
demise, his share was conditionally mutated to his widow namely 
Mst. Alam Khatoon (their maternal grandmother) as limited owner 
who died in the year 1974 and impugned mutation No.82 was 
sanctioned on 24.01.1975 depriving the plaintiffs from their due 
share; that from the wed-lock of Jam with Alam Khatoon one 
daughter namely Mst. Rehmat Bibi was born who contracted 
marriage with Dara and from said marriage the plaintiffs were born, 
therefore, the plaintiffs are grandchildren of Jam and Alam Khatoon; 
that at the time of death of Jam, Mst. Rehmat Bibi was alive but 
thereafter, she was died before the death of her mother Mst. Alam 
Khatoon; that the defendants got mutated the suit property in their 
names after the death of Mst. Alam Khatoon fraudulently and 
secretly and deprived them from their due legal share; that on the 
strength of impugned mutation No.82, one of the beneficiary namely 
Warryam transferred his share through registered sale deed No.1574 
dated 12.07.1975 in favour of Mahabat and thereafter the defendants 
succeeded to get registered sale deed dated 14.09.1981 in their 
favour from the Provincial government and prayed for decree of their 
suit. The defendants resisted the suit through filing separate 
contested written statements and raised certain preliminary 
objections that the plaintiffs have no authority to institute the suit; 
that the plaintiffs have no cause of action because Mst. Rehmat Bibi 
was died on 26.09.1958, therefore, the plaintiffs are not entitled any 
share from the inheritance of Jam because Section 4 of the Muslim 
Family Law Ordinance, 1961 has no retrospective effect; that the suit 
is not maintainable in its present form; that the plaintiffs should have 

Civil Revision No. 270-D of 1997. 
-3-
file suit for recovery of possession; that value of the suit for the 
purpose of court fee and jurisdiction is wrongly fixed; that suit is 
barred by time; that the plaintiffs instituted false and frivolous suit 
therefore, the defendants are entitled to get special costs u/s 35-A 
CPC; that the plaintiffs did not assail the registered sale deed dated 
14.09.1981 executed by the State, therefore, they are estopped from 
their words and conduct to institute the suit. While replying on facts, 
maintained that original Dakheel-Kar namely Jam was died on 
12.01.1950 and after his death his share was transferred to his widow 
namely Alam Khatoon through mutation No.39 dated 23.06.1950 as 
a limited owner who died in the year 1974, therefore, it will be 
presumed that Jam, predecessor of the plaintiffs, was died in the year 
1974 and his succession was open on 1974 whereas, his daughter 
Mst. Rehmat Bibi was died on 26.09.1958, therefore, according to 
law the legal heirs of Mst. Rehmat Bibi were not entitled from the 
inheritance of Jam and impugned mutation was rightly sanctioned 
and prayed for dismissal of the suit. From the divergent pleadings of 
the parties the learned trial Court framed 07 issues. Thereafter, issue-
6-A and 6-B were framed and parties were invited to produce their 
evidence in support of their respective version. The plaintiffs 
produced two witnesses in support of their stance and got exhibited 
07 documents, whereas, the defendants produced two witnesses and 
concluded their evidence. The learned trial Court, after providing 
opportunity of hearing, decreed the suit vide judgment and decree 
dated 29.03.1992 and declared that the plaintiffs are entitled to 09/16 
shares from the inheritance of Jam. Feeling aggrieved, the defendants 
preferred an appeal. During the pendency of appeal, they moved an 
application for amendment of their written statement which was 
allowed and resultantly two further issues i.e. issues No.6-C & 6-D 
were framed and matter was remanded on 13.03.1996 to the learned 
trial Court under Order XLI Rule 25 C.P.C., for decision of said 
issues after recording of evidence of the parties. In the light of said 
order, the defendants got recorded two witnesses as DW-3 & DW-4 
and produced sale deed No.1636 dated 14.09.1981 as Exh.D-1 and 

Civil Revision No. 270-D of 1997.

closed their oral as well as documentary evidence. In rebuttal, the 
plaintiffs produced copy of Jamabandi for the year 1972-73 as 
Exh.P-8. The learned trial Court vide judgment and decree dated 
19.11.1996 decided both the issues against the defendants. The 
defendants also preferred an appeal against the said findings of the 
learned trial Court. The learned appellate Court vide judgment and 
decree dated 12.04.1997 dismissed both the appeals with the 
modification of the shares of the plaintiffs and declared that the share 
of the plaintiffs from the property of Jam will be 07/16+1/16 and in 
this way their total shares from the khatta consisted upon 238 kanals 
01 marla will be 1/6. Being dissatisfied the defendants approached 
this Court through instant Civil Revision. 
3. 
 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at full length 
and perused the record with their able assistance. 
4. 
 
Facts of the case are almost admitted. The land 
measuring 238 kanals 01 marla was allotted to Jam, Noora, Jahana 
by the Provincial government under Dakheel-Kari-Scheme and the 
share of Jam was 1/3rd in the said land. He died on 12.01.1950 
leaving behind one widow namely Mst. Alam Khatoon, one daughter 
namely Mst. Rehmat Bibi, two nephews namely Sher and Khan and 
three nieces namely Roshnai, Bhadai and Salamat from one brother 
namely Noora and two nephews namely Mohabat, Salabat and one 
niece namely Mst. Mahmuda from his other brother namely Jahana. 
After the demise of Jam, his inheritance mutation No.39 was 
sanctioned on 20.06.1950 only in favour of his widow Mst. Alam 
Khatoon as a limited owner. His daughter namely Mst. Rehmat Bibi 
contracted marriage with Dara son of Warryam and from said 
wedlock the plaintiffs were born. Mst. Rehmat Bibi was died on 
26.09.1958, thereafter, Mst. Alam Khatoon was also died in the year 
1974 and her inheritance mutation No.82 was sanctioned on 
24.01.1975 (Exh.P-1) in favour of her brother namely Warryam ¼ 
share, Sher and Khan sons of Noora equal in share i.e. ½ out of ¾ 
shares and Mahabat son of Jahana ½ out of 3/4 shares. 

Civil Revision No. 270-D of 1997.

5. 
 
The plaintiffs challenged said mutation on the ground 
that they are children of Mst. Rehmat Bibi who was alive when the 
original allottee namely Jam had died, therefore, after the death of 
Mst. Alam Khatoon, who was limited owner, property was reverted 
to Jam and they being grand children of Jam and Mst. Alam Khatoon 
in the light of Section 4 of the Muslim Law Ordinance, 1961 are 
entitled their due share from the inheritance of Jam, whereas, the 
stance of the defendants is that as Mst. Rehmat Bibi was died prior to 
the introduction of Section 4 of the Muslim Family Law Ordinance, 
1961, therefore, the plaintiffs were not entitled to get any share from 
the inheritance of Jam as Section 4 of the Ordinance, 1961 has no 
retrospective affect. 
6. 
 
Before discussing further, it is better to see the status of 
Jam with regard to the suit property and the law under which the said 
property was inherited. Admittedly, Jam was allottee of the State 
land which was allotted to him under Dakheel-Kari-Scheme by the 
Provincial government and his status upon the suit property was of 
tenant/original tenant. Section 3 of the Colonization of the 
Government Lands Act, 1912 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, 
1912) defines the terms tenant and original tenant which read as 
under: - 
“Tenant:- Means any person holding land in a colony as a 
tenant of Government and includes the predecessors and 
successors-in-interest of a tenant”.  
 “Original Tenant: Means any person to whom a tenancy is 
first allotted by the collector and includes the male transferee 
of such a tenant and any male nominated by the Collector in 
accordance with the provision of section 21 to succeeds a 
female to whom a tenancy was first allotted.” 
 
7. 
 
Section 20 of the Act, 1912 deals with inheritance of 
tenancy rights which describes that upon the death of original tenant, 
in the absence of male lineal descendants, the tenancy shall devolve 
upon the widow of the tenant until she dies or remarries, failing the 
widow tenancy to devolve upon the un-married daughters of the 
tenant until they died or marry or lose their rights under the 

Civil Revision No. 270-D of 1997. 
-6-
provisions of the Act, 1912. For reference Section 20 of the Act, 
1912 is reproduced as under: - 
“20. Succession to tenants acquiring otherwise than by succession. 
Subject to the proviso to section 14, when, after the commencement of this 
Act, any original tenant dies the succession to the tenancy shall devolve in 
the following order upon. 
 
(a)  
the male lineal descendants of the tenant in the male line of 
descent. (The term ‘lineal descendants’ shall include an adopted 
son whose adoption has been ratified by a registered deed);  
 
(b)  
the widow of the tenant until she dies, or remarries or loses her 
rights under the provisions of this Act;  
 
(c) 
the unmarried daughters of the tenant until they die or marry, or 
use their rights under the provisions of this Act;  
 
(d)  
the successor or successors nominated by the tenant by registered 
deed from among the following persons, that is to say, his mother, 
[his pre-deceased son’s widow, his pre-deceased grandson’s 
widow], his married daughter, his daughter’s son, his sister, his 
sister’s son, and the male agnate members of his family; and  
 
(e)  
the successor or successors nominated by the Collector from 
among the persons enumerated in clause (d) of this section.” 
 
 
8. 
 
The rules of succession contained in clauses “a”, “b”, & 
“c” of Section 20 of the Act, 1912 provide that a widow inherited the 
tenancy under Section 20(b) in the absence of male lineal and is 
subject to the condition that she will hold the estate only till she 
remarries or dies or otherwise losses her right under the provisions of 
the Act, 1912. Meaning thereby, the estate being conferred on her 
was only limited one and the character of this limited estate was 
determined only by the statute. Whereas, in presence of widow, 
daughters will not inherit the tenancy rights and they will only 
succeed under Clause “c” when neither any male lineal descendants 
are available nor any widow is survived at the time of opening of 
succession of tenancy rights. 
 
9. 
 
Section 20 of the Act, 1912, governs the succession to 
the tenancy rights of the original tenant whereas, Section 21 of the 
Act, 1912, contained the rule of successions of the tenant who 
inherited the same from the original tenant. For reference Section 21 
of the Act, 1912 is reproduced as under: - 
“21. Succession to tenants acquiring by succession.— When, after the 
commencement of this Act any male tenant, who is not an original tenant, 

Civil Revision No. 270-D of 1997. 
-7-
dies, or any female tenant dies, marries or re-marries, the succession to 
the tenancy shall devolve:- 
 
(a)  
in the case of a female, to whom the tenancy has been first allotted, 
on the successor nominated by the Collector from the issue of such 
female tenant, or from the male agnates of the person, on account 
of whose services the tenancy was allotted to her; 
(b)  
in all other cases, on the person or persons, who would succeed if 
the tenancy were agricultural land acquired by the original 
tenant.” 
 
 
 
10. 
 
Sections 20 & 21 of the Act, 1912, therefore, embodied 
two different rules of successions to the tenancy of deceased tenant 
applicable in different situations. Section 20 of the Act, 1912 applies 
to successions of tenants who are original tenants whereas Section 21 
governs the case of the tenants who acquires by the succession the 
tenancy.  
11. 
 
After the demise of Jam, his inheritance mutation No.39 
was sanctioned in favour of his widow Mst. Alam Khatoon under 
Section 20(b) of the Act, 1912 as a limited owner with some 
conditions i.e. until she dies or remarries or loses her rights under the 
provision of the Act, 1912. Mst. Alam Khatoon died in the year 1974. 
At that time Section 19-A was incorporated through the Colonization 
of Government Lands (Punjab) amendment Act No.III of 1951. If the 
said provision was not introduced/incorporated at that time, then the 
inheritance will be decided in the light of Section 21 of the Act, 1912. 
But as Section 19-A has been introduced, therefore, the succession 
was to be settled according to the newly added Section 19-A of the 
Act, 1912.  Section 19-A speaks as follow:- 
“19-A. Succession to the tenancy. When after the 
coming into force of the Colonization of Government 
Lands (Punjab) Amendment Act, 1951, any Muslim 
tenant dies, succession to the tenancy shall devolve on 
his heirs in accordance with the Muslim Personal Law 
(Shariat), and nothing contained in sections 20 to 23 of 
this Act shall be applicable to his case. 
 
Provided that when the tenancy rights are held 
by a female as a limited owner under this Act, 
succession shall open out on the termination of her 
limited interest to all persons who would have been 
entitled to inherit the property at the time of the death 
of the last full owner had the Muslim Personal Law 
(Shariat) been applicable at the time of such death, and 
in the event of the death of any of such persons before 

Civil Revision No. 270-D of 1997. 
-8-
the termination of the limited interest mentioned above, 
succession shall devolve on his heirs and successors 
existing at the time of the termination of the limited 
interest of the female as if the aforesaid such person 
had died at the termination of the limited interest of the 
female and had been governed by the Muslim Personal 
Law (Shariat): 
 
Provided further that the share, which the female 
limited owner would have inherited had the Muslim 
Personal Law (Shariat) been applicable at the time of 
the death of the last full owner shall devolve on her if 
she loses her limited interest in the property on account 
of her marriage or remarriage and on her heirs under 
the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) if her limited 
interest terminates because of her death.” 
 
12 
 
No doubt the newly inserted section 19-A of the Act, 
1912 purports to apply the Muslim Personal Laws to all cases 
formally governed by Section 20 to 23 of the Act, 1912. The newly 
inserted Section 19-A, the provisos to which are couched in 
practically, the same language as Section 3 of the West Punjab 
Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1948, but the same 
has also brought a few minor changes in the course of succession in 
cases formerly governed by clause (b) of Section 21 of the Act, 1912. 
One of these changes is that, whereas, formerly if succession opened 
out on the termination of the interest of a female tenant, the tenancy 
rights were to be deemed to be agricultural land acquired by the 
original tenant, after the insertion of Section 19-A, such tenancy 
rights are to be deemed to be the property of the last male owner who 
may or may not have been the original tenant. 
13. 
 
This case clearly falls under Section 19-A of the Act, 
1912 which provides that “when the tenancy rights are held by a 
female as a limited owner under this Act, succession shall open out 
on the termination of her limited interest to all persons who would 
have been entitled to inherit the property at the time of the death of 
the last full owner, had the Muslim personal law (Shariat) been 
applicable at the time of such death, and in the event of the death of 
any of such persons before the termination of the limited interest 
mentioned above, succession shall devolve on his heirs and 
successors existing at the time of the termination of the limited 

Civil Revision No. 270-D of 1997. 
-9-
interest of the female as if the aforesaid such person had died at the 
termination of the limited interest of the female and had been 
governed by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat)”. 
It was further provided that “the share, which the female 
limited owner would have inherited had the Muslim Personal Law 
(Shariat) been applicable at the time of the death of the last full 
owner shall devolve on her if she loses her limited interest in the 
property on account of her marriage or remarriage and on her heirs 
under the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) if her limited interest 
terminates because of her death.” 
14. 
 
In the light of above said discussion, it is apparent on 
the record that at the time of the death of Jam, his widow namely Mst. 
Alam Khatoon was alive, who inherited 1/8 share as his widow, Mst. 
Rehmat Bibi will get ½ share out of 7/8 shares (left after the 
deduction of widow share) and the remaining i.e. 7/16 shares will be 
devolved amongst the collaterals of Jam i.e. his nephews, sons of his 
brothers namely Noora and Jahana. After the death of Mst. Alam 
Khatoon, his share 1/8 will be distributed to her daughter i.e. ½ share 
out of 1/8 and the remaining ½ share out of 1/8 share will be gone to 
her brother namely Warryam. In this way, Mst. Rehmat Bibi 
inherited 7/16 shares from his father namely Jam and 1/16 shares 
from her mother namely Mst. Alam Khatoon. Jam was owner of 1/3rd 
share in the khatta consisted upon 238 kanals 01 marla, therefore, 
the share of Mst. Rehmat Bibi in the whole khatta will be 01/6. 
15. 
 
Next question for determination is that whether the 
plaintiffs were entitled to receive said shares of Mst. Rehmat Bibi or 
not, as she had been died on 26.09.1958 before the promulgation of 
Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as 
“Ordinance 1961”) Undeniably, under the Islamic Sharia, 
predeceased children are not entitled to any inheritance as only the 
survivors to a deceased are entitled to inheritance. In the year 1961, 
the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 was promulgated on 
15.07.1961 and was commenced after issuance of Notification which 
was published in PLD 1961 Central Statutes at Page 337, wherein 

Civil Revision No. 270-D of 1997. 
-10-
section 4 was introduced, by virtue of which, legal heirs of pre-
deceased son or daughter of propositus would be entitled to 
inheritance on re-opening of the succession, which reads as under: - 
Section 4.-In the event of the death of any son or daughter of 
the propositus before the opening of the succession, the 
children of such son or daughter, if any, living at the time the 
succession opens, shall per stripes receive a share equivalent 
to the share which such son or daughter, as the case may be, 
would  have received, if alive.” 
 
Admittedly, later on section 4 of Ordinance, 1961 was 
declared un-Islamic by the Federal Shariat Court in a case titled 
“ALLAH RAKHA and others versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN 
and others” (PLD 2000 FSC 1) and had also fixed cut-off date 
31.03.2000 i.e., said section shall cease to have effect after the 
target date, the relevant portion is as under:- 
“In view of the foregoing discussion, we hold that the 
provision contained in section 4 of the Muslim Family Laws 
Ordinance, 1961, as presently in force is repugnant to the 
Injunctions of Islam and direct the President of Pakistan to 
take steps to amend the law so as to bring the said provision 
in conformity with the Injunctions of Islam. We further direct 
that the said provisions which have been held repugnant to 
the Injunctions of Islam shall cease to have effected from 31st 
day of March, 2000.” 
 
The aforesaid judgment has been challenged by the 
Government before the august Supreme Court of Pakistan, 
therefore, said judgment of the Federal Shariat Court suspended 
automatically till the disposal of appeal in view of Article 
203(D),1(A)(2) proviso of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973. Hence, section 4 of the Ordinance, 1961 shall 
remain in field till the decision of appeal by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, Shariat Appellate Bench. 
16. 
 
The plaintiffs cannot be said to have had any vested 
right with regard to property/estate of Jam during the life time of 
Mst. Alam Khatoon. Their right to succession came into existence 
on the death of Mst. Alam Khatoon who died in the year 1974 as 
the property reverted to the original owner i.e. Jam. According to 
Section 19-A of the Act, 1912, on the termination of limited 

Civil Revision No. 270-D of 1997. 
-11-
interest of Mst. Alam Khatoon the succession shall open out to all 
persons who would have been entitled to inherit the property at the 
time of the death of the last full owner and admittedly Mst. Rehmat 
Bibi was alive at that time, therefore, the plaintiffs are entitled to 
inherit the share of Mst. Rehmat Bibi from her father. 
With regard to share from the inheritance of their 
grandmother namely Mst. Alam Khatoon, it is observed that their 
right to succession came into existence on the death of propositus 
(Mst. Alam Khatoon) as at that time the ordinance 1961 was in the 
field and operative. The words “In the event of death of any son or 
daughter of propositus before the opening of succession” appearing 
in Section 4 of the Ordinance, 1961 are very important and were 
interpreted by in a case titled as “YUSUF ABBAS and others versus 
MST ISMAT MUSTAFA and others” reported as (PLD 1968 
Karachi 480) in the following terms:- 
“The words ‘in the event of’ refer only to the death of the son or 
daughter of the propositus occurring before the succession opens. 
These words would bring within their compass the sons and 
daughters dying before as well as after the Ordinance came into 
force. The only condition is that the death should occur before the 
succession has opened and if the succession opens after the 
promulgation of the Ordinance, Section 4 would apply with full 
force and the children of the predeceased son or daughter of the 
propositus would be entitled to be included in the succession to the 
estate of the propositus. One consideration, which has to be borne 
in mind in construing of section 4 of the Ordinance is the purpose 
for which this law was passed. The Ordinance aims at alleviating 
the sufferings of the children whose unfortunate lot it is to lose 
their father or mother during the lifetime of their grandfather or 
grand-mother as the case may be. The construction of such statutes 
should be just, sensible and liberal so as to give effect to the 
purpose for which they are passed. The meaning, which Dr. I, 
Mahmood, seeks to give to the word ‘in the event of’ in section 4, is 
not only against the plain and unambiguous language of the 
section but would lead to unjust and harsh consequences and 
would defeat the very intent and purpose for which this law was 
brought. My conclusion, therefore, is that it is not the requirement 
of section 4 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 that the 
occurrence of the death of the son or daughter of the propositus as 
well as the opening of succession should both take place 
subsequent to the promulgation of the Ordinance. The only 
requirement of the section is that succession should open after the 
Ordinance is brought into effect even though in some cases a part 
of the requisites for its operation such as the death of the plaintiff’s 
mother is drawn from a time antecedent to the promulgation of the 
Ordinance.” 
 

Civil Revision No. 270-D of 1997. 
-12-
This observation was later on followed by this Court in 
judgments reported as “SAKHI MUHAMMAD versus AHMAD 
KHAN and 3 others” (1980 CLC 1006), and “IBRAHIM and 3 
others versus NEHMAT BI and 5 others” (PLD 1988 Lahore 186). 
This court in another case titled “Kamal Khan alias Kamala versus 
Zainab Bibi” (PLD 1983 Lahore 546) laid down the following 
principle:- 
“The Starting point is that notionally the offspring of the 
propositus is deemed to be alive for the purpose of succession, at 
the time of the death of the propositus, and the succession of the 
grandchild is to be calculated again notionally as if the parent of 
the grandchild died after the death of the original propositus.”  
 
17. 
 
The ratio of aforesaid judgments is that the 
grandchildren are entitled to receive share equal to the share of their 
mother or father in view of section 4 of the Ordinance, 1961 
irrespective of the fact their mother or father died before or after the 
promulgation of the Ordinance, 1961 and the only condition is that 
the succession should be open after the promulgation of the 
Ordinance, 1961. 
18. 
 
It is settled law that no limitation runs against a wrong 
entry, mutation is also not a starting point of limitation. In a matter 
of inheritance, the limitation does not preclude a person to get his 
share from inheritance. Learned trial Court framed issue No.6-B with 
regard to limitation in the light of preliminary objection raised by 
defendants and placed its onus upon defendants. The defendants 
failed to produce any evidence to discharge the initial onus, therefore, 
learned trial Court decided the issue against them. Learned appellate 
Court also agreed with the findings of learned trial Court and also 
held that suit for declaration as to legal status of plaintiffs is quite 
maintainable in matter of inheritance. The plaintiffs being co-sharer 
will be considered as in joint constructive possession of property 
with other co-sharers. Defendants did not challenge those findings by 
filing any cross-objection; therefore, the objection of defendants that 
the suit is time-barred at this stage is misconceived.  

Civil Revision No. 270-D of 1997. 
-13-
During the course of arguments much emphasis has been laid 
by the learned counsel for the defendants that the mutation validly 
sanctioned way back decades together which carried the presumption 
of truth, has unlawfully been upset by the Courts below and in 
recording the adverse findings, both the Courts below have 
committed illegalities and irregularities in exercise of their 
jurisdiction. This limb of argument of learned counsel for the 
defendants carries no weight. Mutations are never the instrument of 
title and the same are also not a part of the record of right and do not 
create any title and they are sanctioned only for fiscal purpose, with 
a view to keep the record straight. Entries embodied in the mutation 
and the endorsement made by the Assistant Collector of either grade 
can conveniently be challenged and brought under impeachment 
before the Civil Court. Mutation which has been sanctioned to the 
exclusion of the legal heirs of the deceased was nothing but a waste 
paper, running counter to the Shariah by which the Muslim right 
holders are governed.

All pending C.Ms., are also decided today through 
separate orders. 
20. 
 
Epitome of above discussion is that the instant Civil 
Revision is without any force; hence, the same is dismissed. Parties 
are left to bear their own costs.
