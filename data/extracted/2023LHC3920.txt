Mr. Khadim Hussain Tahir Hashmi, Advocate for the 
petitioner. 
 
Mr. Waqas Umar, Assistant Advocate General with 
Muhammad Akram ASI. 
Ms. Rahat Majeed, ADPP on Court’s call. 
 
Mrs. Naseem Akhtar, wife of respondent No.5 in person. 
 
 
             Briefly the facts of the case leading to the filing of instant writ 
petition are that on the application of Muhammad Ashraf son of 
Muhammad Khan (respondent No.5) containing the allegation of 
misappropriation of his Tractor Belarus bearing No.7217/SBA with 
Engine No.480681, Chassis No.05734774, an FIR No.570/2019 under 
sections 420/468/471 PPC was registered at police station Gogera and 
investigation of the said case was entrusted to Hafeez Ullah Shah, ASI 
(Petitioner). Subsequently while suspecting defective investigation, the 
complainant (respondent No.5) filed an application under section 22-A 
(6) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Cr.P.C.) before the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge/Ex-officio Justice of the Peace, Okara with 
two-fold prayer i.e., for transfer of investigation as well as initiation of 
proceedings under Article 155(1)(c) of the Police Order, 2002 against 
the Investigating Officer. On such application, besides order for transfer 
of investigation, vide the same impugned order dated 09.02.2023 the 
SHO police station Gogera was directed to register FIR against the 
present petitioner under Article 155(1)(c) of Police Order, 2002, which is 
the precise grievance of the petitioner.  
2.     
Learned counsel for the petitioner states that on the similar 
allegation a departmental inquiry was conducted against the petitioner 
but he was exonerated from the charge and direction of ex-officio 
Justice of the Peace amounts to double jeopardy.  Further  states  that  

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               2 
 
if the liability is conceded, even then no cognizable offence is committed 
and direction for registration of FIR under Article 155(1)(c) the Police 
Order, 2002 is misconceived. On the other hand, learned Counsel for 
the respondent states that order was perfect in the circumstances.  
3.      
Arguments heard; record perused. 
4.     
 It has been observed that for defective investigation, Pakistan 
Penal Code, 1860 (PPC) identifies two provisions i.e., Sections; 166(2) 
& 186(2) which according to the second schedule of Cr.P.C. are non-
cognizable, therefore, FIR cannot be registered. If specific sections 
applicable to the situations fall non-cognizable, then ex-officio Justice 
the Peace should not have resorted to Article 155(1)(c) referred above.  
 
5.      
Police an entity cannot be read in complete topsy-turviness, 
they hang up by overdue and expectations attached to their job 
description (JDs), which though rowing them into hardships yet with 
butch intervals and feisty sighs they move on. They feel like angels in 
distress situation with mighty spirits to rescue ailing souls, soaring or 
oppressed communities but sometimes react with boo-boo, after all they 
are human force and to err is human; their extra bondage in the form of 
long hours of duty sometimes transform their gentle instinct into hideous 
habits, may be due to change in chemical composition of the body so as 
to make them nimble or docile, the two human attributes contributory to 
revolt or destroy, which most of the time controls their responding 
abilities in comprehension or execution of orders. Principle of stick and 
carrot is the rule for discipline maintenance on the administrative side, 
that is why they are punished or rewarded for derelictions and a duty-
ride but resolution and hope tagged or anchored to their spirit make 
them alive to serve with best of their abilities. Diversification is inherent 
in human beings which creates variables expecting different treatment 
from people at the top who should understand this difference while 
dealing with officers of different ranks in police. Law also suggests 
different processes to meet with various kinds of misdemeanours by 
police. Police is a major component of criminal justice system, their 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               3 
 
blood is used for intelligence, information sharing, preventing crimes, 
security, maintaining law and order situation, inquiries, investigation, 
process serving, recovery of detenus, evidence support and progression 
in a trial. They despite being dutiful, sometimes deflect the processes, 
missed the direction with failed execution of court orders, therefore, they 
are treated differently in law on such omissions, but Courts usually 
preferred to pass omnibus orders for registration of FIRs against them. 
Though law authorizes for such an action yet it is not the panacea but a 
last resort depending upon the nature of allegations. It is in the 
experience that power brings atrocious attitude, self-centric touch and 
inflated egos if remained unchecked. The police in exercise of such 
powers when fall in misdemeanours, they are resisted with the force of 
law vested on the Courts or the administrative authorities. Here are 
some measures to deal with different types of derelictions or 
misdemeanours. 
                                                                  During Investigation   
 “Section 166 (2) PPC: Whoever being a public servant entrusted with the 
investigation of a case fails to carry out the investigation properly or 
diligently or fails to pursue the case in court of law properly and in 
breach of his duties shall be punished with imprisonment of either 
description for a term which may extend to three year or with fine or with 
both. 
 
Section 186 (2) PPC: Whoever intentionally hampers, misleads, 
jeopardizes or defeats an investigation, inquiry or prosecution or issues 
a false or defective report in a case under any law for the time being in 
force shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend 
to three years or with fine or with both.” 
 
 
Both these offences are non-cognizable, therefore, direction for initiating 
the process u/s 155 of Cr.P.C. can be passed or aggrieved can file 
private complaint under such sections in respective court. Section 166, 
is the scheduled offences of Anti-Corruption Establishment Ordinance 
1961, therefore, a reference can be sent for inquiry if it could be 
materialized for registration of FIR by Anti-Corruption Establishment. 
                                                             Contempt of Lawful Authority 
175. Omission to produce document to public servant by person 
legally bound to produce it. Whoever, being legally bound to produce 
or deliver up any document to any public servant, as such, intentionally 
omits so to produce or deliver up the same, shall be punished with 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               4 
 
simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month, or with 
fine which may extend to one thousand five hundred rupees, or with 
both; or, if the document is to be produced or delivered up to a Court of 
Justice, with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to six 
months, or with fine which may extend to three thousand rupees, or with 
both. 
 
177. Furnishing false information: Whoever, being legally bound to 
furnish information on any subject to any public servant, as such, 
furnishes, as true, information on the subject which he knows or has 
reason to believe to be false, shall be punished with simple 
imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine 
which may extend to three thousand rupees or with both; or, if the 
information which he is legally bound to give respects the commission of 
an offence, or is required for the purpose of preventing the commission 
of an offence, or in order to the apprehension of an offender, with 
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two 
years, or with fine, or with both. 
 
178. Refusing oath or affirmation when duly required by public 
servant to make it Whoever refuses to bind himself by an oath or 
affirmation to state the truth, when required so to bind himself by a 
public servant legally competent to require that he shall so bind himself, 
shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may 
extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to three thousand 
rupees, or with both. 
 
179. Refusing to answer public servant authorized to question 
Whoever, being legally bound to state the truth on any subject to any 
public servant, refuses to answer any question demanded of him 
touching that subject by such public servant in the exercise of the legal, 
powers of such public servant shall be punished with simple 
imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine 
which may extend to three thousand rupees, or with both. 
 
180. Refusing to sign statement: Whoever refuses to sign any 
statement made by him, when required to sign that statement by a 
public servant legally competent to require that he shall sign that 
statement, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which 
may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one 
thousand, or with both. 
 
181. False statement on oath or affirmation to public servant or 
person authorized to administer an oath or affirmation: Whoever, 
being legally bound by an oath or affirmation to state the truth on any 
subject to any public servant or other person authorized by law to 
administer such oath or affirmation, makes, to such public servant or 
other person as aforesaid, touching that subject any statement which is 
false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not 
believe to be true, shall be punished with imprisonment of either 
description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also 
be liable to fine. 
 
228. Intentional insult or interruption to public servant sitting in 
judicial proceeding Whoever intentionally offers any insult or causes 
any interruption to any public servant, while such public servant is sitting 
in any stage of a judicial proceeding, shall be punished with simple 
imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine 
which may extend to three thousand rupees, or with both. 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               5 
 
 
6.     Police is bound to obey and promptly execute all lawful orders, 
perform other duties and exercise powers as are conferred by this 
Order, the Code or any other law for the time being in force as ordained 
under Article 4(1)(m) & (n) of Police Order, 2002, therefore, 
disobedience to any order passed by a court if falling in above situations 
can validly be applied on police officers/officials for sentence suggested 
therein. However, different mechanisms are in place to deal with such 
offences. Some of above sections could be attended with following 
procedure explained in Cr.P.C. 
 
“480. Procedure in certain cases of contempt.-- (1) When any such 
offences as is described in section 175, section 178, section 179, 
section 180 or section 228 of the Pakistan Penal Code is committed in 
the view or presence of any Civil, Criminal or Revenue Court, the Court 
may cause the offender to be detained in custody and at any time 
before the rising of the Court on the same day may, if it thinks fit, take 
cognizance of the offence and sentence the offender to fine, not 
exceeding two hundred rupees, and, in default of payment, to simple 
imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month, unless such 
fine be sooner paid. 
 
482. Procedure where Court considers that case should not be 
dealt with under section 480.--(1) If the Court in any case considers 
that a person accused of any of the offences referred to in section 480 
and committed in its view or presence should be imprisoned otherwise 
than in default of payment of fine, or that a fine exceeding two hundred 
rupees should be imposed upon him, or such Court is for any other 
reason of opinion that the case should not be disposed of under section 
480, such Court after recording the facts constituting the offence and 
the statement of the accused as hereinbefore provided, may forward the 
case to a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the same and may require 
security to be given for the appearance of such accused person before 
such Magistrate or if sufficient security is not given, shall forward such 
person in custody to such Magistrate.  
(2) The Magistrate, to whom any case is forwarded under this 
section, shall proceed to hear the complaint against the accused person 
in manner hereinbefore provided.” 
 
Prosecution of offences u/ss 172 to 188 PPC shall ordinarily be initiated 
in the court of competent jurisdiction but on the complaint of concerned 
court/public servant as per section 195 Cr.P.C.; however, Section 228 
PPC can also be prosecuted u/s 476 of Cr.P.C.  
                      
                                                          Offences under Police Order, 2002 
 
155.  Penalty for certain types of misconduct by police officers:- (1) 
Any police officer who– 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               6 
 
         (a)  makes for obtaining release from service as police officer, a 
false statement or a statement which is misleading in material 
particulars or uses a false document for the purpose; 
         (b) is guilty of cowardice, or being a police officer of junior rank, 
resigns his office or withdraws himself from duties without permission; 
         (c)  is guilty of any willful breach or neglect of any provision of law 
or of any rule or regulation or any order which he is bound to observe or 
obey; 
         (d) is guilty of any violation of duty; 
         (e)  is found in a state of intoxication, while on duty; 
         (f)  malingers or feigns or voluntarily causes hurt to himself with 
the intention to render himself unfit for duty; 
         (g) is grossly insubordinate to his superior officer or uses criminal 
force against a superior officer; or 
         (h) engages himself or participates in any demonstration, 
procession or strike or resorts to or in any way abets any form of strike 
or coercion or physical duress to force any authority to concede 
anything, 
shall, on conviction, for every such offence be punished with 
imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and with fine. 
 
      (2)  Prosecution under this Article shall require a report on writing by 
an officer authorized in this behalf under the rules. 
  
156.  Penalty for vexatious entry, search, arrest, seizure of 
property, torture, etc.– Whoever, being a police officer– 
         (a)  without lawful authority, or reasonable cause, enters or 
searches or causes to be entered or searched any building, vessel, tent 
or place; 
         (b)  vexatiously and unnecessarily seizes the property of any 
person; 
         (c)  vexatiously and unnecessarily detains, searches or arrests 
any person; or 
         (d) inflicts torture or violence to any person in his custody; 
shall, for every such offence, on conviction, be punished with 
imprisonment for a term, which may extend to five years and with fine. 
  
157.  Penalty for unnecessary delay in producing arrested persons 
in courts.– Any police officer who vexatiously and unnecessarily delays 
the forwarding to a court or to any other authority to whom he is legally 
bound to forward any arrested person, shall, on conviction, be punished 
with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year and with 
fine. 
 
7.    
Clauses (c) & (d) of Article 155(1) above are relevant to the 
subject under discussion because for willful breach or neglect of any 
provision of law or of any rule or regulation or any order which the police 
is bound to observe or obey or guilty of any violation of duty, FIR can be 
registered as being cognizable offences but under Article 155(2) of the 
Police Order, it still needs a sanction for prosecution in the form of report 
in writing by an officer authorized in this behalf under the rules. Article 2 
(xxiii) of Police Order, 2002 says, ‘rules’ means rules made under this 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               7 
 
Order and as per Article 186 of Police Order, 2002 “Existing police 
deemed to be constituted under this Order” therefore, Police Rules,1934 
shall also be deemed applicable until the new rules are framed. As per 
Police Rules, 1934, Deputy Inspector General of Police is the authorized 
officer for granting sanction for prosecution which is as under:- 
 
“16.11.  Prosecution under Section 29, Act V of 1861.—When a 
disciplinary offence on the part of a police officer can be adequately 
punished departmentally, such officer shall not be prosecuted under 
section 29 of the Police Act, and no upper subordinate shall be 
prosecuted under that section without the sanction of the Deputy 
Inspector General.” 
                                                                                      
                                                                                  (Emphasis supplied) 
                                     
Section 29 of Police Act, 1861 is parametria to Article 155 of the Police 
Order, therefore, above mechanism would also be in place for action 
under Article 155 above. Similarly, in another situation, the same officer 
is authorized to initiate judicial prosecution.  
“16.12.  Judicial prosecutions: - When a police officer is departmentally 
punished for an offence committed in his public capacity for which he is 
liable to be prosecuted criminally, the Deputy Inspector General is 
required to satisfy himself that the course adopted was expedient in the 
interests of the administration, and may order a criminal prosecution if 
he considers it desirable.” 
 
It is held that for initiation of departmental action against any rank of 
police officer/official, different authorities are authorized in the police 
hierarchy but for judicial prosecution respective Deputy Inspector 
General of Police is the authorized officer. Therefore, despite 
registration of FIR, sanction of prosecution shall further determine the 
continuation of proceedings against the accused police officer/official. If 
such sanction is not available then court cannot proceed further. This 
situation has impliedly been met under section 230 of Cr.P.C. which is 
as under:- 
“230. Stay of proceedings If prosecution of offence in altered 
charge requires previous sanction: - If the offence stated in the new 
or altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous 
Sanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such 
sanction is obtained, unless sanction has been already obtained for a 
prosecution on the same facts as those on which the new or altered 
charge is founded.” 
 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               8 
 
If required sanction is not given then court can stay the proceeding in 
trial of such offence or Prosecutor can drop the prosecution of such 
offence under section 10(3)(f) of the Punjab Criminal Prosecution 
Service (Constitution, Functions and Powers) Act, 2006.  
 
           Types of offences if committed under Article 156 of the Police 
Order, 2002, do not require any sanction of authorized officer and being 
punishable up to five years would be cognizable as per second schedule 
of Cr.P.C. under segment “offences against other laws”, therefore after 
registration of FIR it shall be prosecuted through a normal course of trial. 
However, offence under Article 157 being punishable up to one year 
shall be non-cognizable as per above scheme; thus, for such offence 
action can be taken as per Section 155 of Cr.P.C. meant for 
investigation into non-cognizable offences but if some cognizable 
offences are also attracted in the series of act, then it shall also be 
investigated with cognizable offences without the permission of a 
magistrate. Reliance is on “OBAIDULLAH KHAN Versus INAYATULLAH KHAN” 
(1998 P Cr. L.J 1718)  
 
                                      Administrative side 
 
8.   
A complete mechanism has been provided in Police Order, 
2002, therefore, no new legislation is required except to make functional 
the following Complaints Authority.  
“106.  Functions of the Provincial Police Complaints Authority: -
 The Provincial Police Complaints Authority shall perform the following 
functions: - 
         (a)  receive from District Public Safety Commission or an 
aggrieved person in writing on an affidavit, complaint of neglect, 
excess or misconduct against a Police Officer; 
         (b)  process the complaint and refer the ordinary cases to an 
appropriate authority for action and report and in serious cases initiate 
action on its own; 
         (c)  receive from the District Public Safety Commission or Head 
of District Police any report of death, rape or serious injury to any 
person in police custody and take steps to preserve evidence relating 
to such incident and request the Chief Justice of the High Court under 
intimation to the Government to appoint a Judge not below the District 
and Sessions Judge for a judicial enquiry; 
         (d)  may appoint in appropriate cases a police officer of the same 
district or of a different district who is senior in rank to the officer 
complained against as an inquiry officer, and supervise the inquiry 
proceedings; 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               9 
 
         (e)  send a copy of the report to the competent authority and 
direct him for departmental action based on the findings of the enquiry 
or registration of a criminal case as appropriate and direct the 
competent authority to submit a report about the action taken on the 
findings of the report; 
         (f)  inform the complainant of the outcome of the enquiry in 
writing as soon as possible; 
         (g)  where the Provincial Police Complaints Authority is not 
satisfied with the order in cases referred under clause (e), it may send 
a report to the next higher authority for revision of the order by the 
awarding officer and the process be repeated till it is considered by the 
final authority; 
         (h)  in case of any frivolous, or vexatious complaint, initiate legal 
action against the complainant; 
         (i)   may recommend disciplinary action against an enquiry officer 
for willful neglect or mishandling of an enquiry; 
         (j)   prepare and send to the Government an annual report on 
matters relating generally to its functions, including any matter to which 
it considers attention of the Government may be drawn by reason of 
gravity or other exceptional circumstances, for laying the report before 
Provincial Assembly; 
         (k)  may in consultation with the Provincial Government establish 
regional offices anywhere in the province.” 
 
The above regime caters to almost every situation, giving remedy to 
aggrieved persons, senior police officers (see Article-36) to report 
derelictions of police in different ranks. Police officers shall liable to be 
proceeded against for departmental action with or without a direction to 
register an FIR. It also covers the conduct of judicial inquiry with a 
request to Chief Justice of the High Court under intimation to the 
Government to appoint a Judge not below the District and Sessions 
Judge for said purpose. By establishing the regional offices, the 
grievances redressal mechanism becomes accessible to all concerned 
making it an inexpensive and expeditious process of taking proper 
action. Action against frivolous complaints is also a solution in above 
Article which can be materialized as under:- 
“152.  Penalty for frivolous or vexatious complaint:- Any person who 
files a complaint against the police, which on enquiry by the Police 
Complaints Authority is held frivolous or vexatious, shall be punished 
on conviction with imprisonment for six months, or with fine, which may 
extend to fifty thousand rupees, or with both.” 
 
Above offence is cognizable as per following Article of the Police Order, 
2002:- 
“153.  Certain offences to be cognizable: - Notwithstanding anything 
contained in the Code, offences falling under Articles 148 to 152 shall 
be cognizable.” 
 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               10 
 
All the offences highlighted above except offences for contempt of lawful 
authority of court can simply be regulated through Police Complaints 
Authority which after attending it through inquiry can decide as to 
whether action on the departmental side be taken or FIR be registered. 
Where the offences are non-cognizable Police Complaints Authority can 
pass direction for action u/s 155 Cr.P.C. for investigation with the 
permission of concerned magistrate or if they are scheduled offences of 
Anti-Corruption Establishment, reference can be sent to that department 
for further action.  
9.     
The Police Order, 2002 does not specifically provide any 
remedy against failure, neglect or excess committed by Police 
Complaints Authority in taking action against the delinquent police 
officer/officials, therefore, the law suggested a course in the form of 
section 22-A (6) Cr.P.C, which was inserted through the Criminal 
Procedure (Third Amendment) Ordinance (Federal Ordinance No. 
CXXXI) of 2002 on 21.11.2002 only to cater to the requirement of newly 
enacted Police Order, 2002 which was promulgated on 14.08.2002. 
Insertion of Section 22-A (6) Cr. P.C. was also felt when this Court in a 
case reported as “MIAN KHAN and others Versus INSPECTOR GENERAL OF 
POLICE PUNJAB and others” (PLD 2002 Lahore 619) has interpreted the 
powers exercisable u/s 22-A & 22-B by the Sessions Judges, Additional 
Sessions Judges and Magistrates for appropriate direction to police 
authorities to perform their administrative duties properly and diligently. 
The above case was decided on 26th September, 2002 after 
promulgation of Police Order, 2002 (14.08.2002) wherein question of 
transfer of investigation, registration of FIR, and to prevent excess by 
police was discussed and it was also suggested as under:-  
 
 “The provisions of the Police Order, 2002 should also be kept in view while 
exercising powers in this regard, in case an aggrieved person approached 
the Sessions Judges with any grievance of the kind noted above, the 
Judges or Magistrates shall issue necessary direction to police even in the 
absence of any direction from the High Court and the District Nazim can 
also be advised to come to the aid of aggrieved party and to exercise 
powers under section 35 of the Police Order, 2002.” 
                                                                                                                             (Emphasis supplied) 
 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               11 
 
10.      The cited Amendment in Cr.P.C. for insertion of section 22-A 
(6) was made on 21.11.2002 which is as follows:- 
“[(6) An ex-officio Justice of the Peace may issue appropriate directions to 
the police authorities concerned on a complaint regarding- 
 
 
(i) non-registration of a criminal case;  
 
(ii) transfer of investigation from one police officer to another; and  
 
 
(iii) neglect, failure or excess committed by a police authority in relation to its 
functions and duties.] “ 
 
This provision was specially designed to meet with new regimes 
introduced in the Police Order, 2002 in the form of “Transfers of 
investigation, Public Safety Commission, Police Complaints Authority, 
and action for neglect, failure or excess committed by police officers”. 
Police authorities particularly designed for such functions are mentioned 
in different Articles of the Police Order, 2002, i.e., Article 18-A (Transfer 
of investigation); and for neglect, failure and excess committed by Police 
authorities in respect of their official duties, the establishment of Federal 
Police Complaints Authority and Provincial Police Complaints Authority 
was suggested in Chapter-X of the Police Order, 2002 starting from 
Article 97 to 108. According to provisions of Chapter-X above the 
Government shall establish a Federal Police Complaints Authority for 
enquiring into serious complaints against the members of Federal Law 
Enforcement Agencies and Provincial Police Complaints Authority for 
enquiring into serious complaints against the police. The members of 
both Police Complaints Authorities shall be eminent persons of 
impeccable integrity with skills, knowledge and experience in such fields 
as may be specified by the Government. Both Police Complaints 
Authorities shall consist of a Chairperson and six members. Function of 
Provincial Police Complaints Authority has already been highlighted in 
preceding paragraph No. 8. If a direction passed by ex-officio Justice of 
the Peace is not complied with then action for disobedience of his order 
can be taken in the like manner as mentioned in a case reported as 
“KHIZER HAYAT and others Versus INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF POLICE 
(PUNJAB), LAHORE and others” (PLD 2005 Lahore 470) including 
registration of FIR as held in case reported as “ZULFIQAR Versus 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               12 
 
ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE/EX-OFFICIO JUSTICE OF PEACE, Lahore and 2 
others” (2021 P Cr. L J 1779). 
 
11. 
While dictating the order, a fact was taken notice of that Articles 
103 to 108 of Police Order, 2002 relating to establishment of Provincial 
Police Complaints Authority were shown omitted through Police Order 
(Second Amendment) Ordinance, 2005 (Ordinance IX of 2005); 
therefore, continuation of such Ordinance was checked and it was 
disclosed that Ordinance had elapsed after certain period as mentioned 
in the Constitution. However later Police Order (Amendment) Ordinance, 
2007 (Ordinance No. XLI of 2007) was promulgated and such Articles of 
Police Order, 2002 were again omitted which fact is mentioned in the 
cited Ordinance at Para No.46. It was observed that said Ordinance was 
to be expired on 26.11.2007 but before that an emergency was imposed 
in the country on 03.11.2007 and through Provisional Constitutional 
Order (PCO), it was ordained that any Ordinance etc. in force at the time 
of proclamation of emergency shall remain operative and it shall be 
exempted from limit of Constitutional duration. This situation was taken 
care of by the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan as per judgment 
reported as “SINDH HIGH COURT BAR ASSOCIATION through its 
Secretary and another Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN” (PLD 
2009 Supreme Court 879). The Ordinance of year 2007 supra was not 
declared as permanent law rather an Ordinance subject to validation by 
the respective legislature. It was declared that any Ordinance passed 
before or after 3rd November, 2007 up to 15th December, 2007 be laid 
before the competent authority. The relevant parts of judgment are cited 
as under:- 
185. It may be noted that Article 4 of PCO No. 1 of 2007 provided that 
notwithstanding the abeyance of the provisions of the Constitution, but subject to 
the Orders of the President, all laws other than the Constitution, all Ordinances, 
Orders, Rules, Bye-laws, Regulations, Notifications and other legal instruments 
in force in any part of Pakistan, whether made by the President or, the Governor 
of a Province would continue in force until altered, or repealed by the President 
or any authority designated by him. Clause (1) of Article 5 ibid provided that an 
Ordinance promulgated by the President or by the Governor of a Province shall 
not be subject to any limitations as to duration prescribed in the Constitution. 
Likewise, under clause (2) of the said Article, an Ordinance issued by the 
President or by a Governor which was in force immediately before the 
commencement of Proclamation of Emergency of the 3rd day of November, 
2007 shall also not be subject to aforesaid limitations. As a result, all the 
Ordinances, which were in force on 3rd November, 2007 as well as the 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               13 
 
Ordinances which were promulgated on or after 3rd November, 2007 up to 15th 
December, 2007 were continued in force as permanent laws and were not laid 
before the respective legislatures during the period prescribed by the 
Constitution. 
  
186. Proclamation of Emergency and PCO No. 1 of 2007 having been declared 
unconstitutional and void ab initio and the validity purportedly conferred on all 
such Ordinances by means of Article 270AAA and by the judgment in Tikka Iqbal 
Muhammad Khan's case also having been shorn, such Ordinances would cease 
to be permanent laws with the result that the life of such Ordinances would be 
limited to the period specified in Articles 89 and 128 of the Constitution, viz., four 
months and three months respectively from the date of their promulgation. Under 
Article 89 of the Constitution, an Ordinance issued by the President, if not so laid 
before the National Assembly, or both Houses of Parliament, stands repealed on 
expiration of four months from its promulgation. Similarly, under Article 128 of the 
Constitution, an Ordinance issued by the Governor, if not so laid before the 
concerned Provincial Assembly, stands repealed on expiration of three months 
from its promulgation. 
 
187. It may be noted that such Ordinances were continued in force throughout 
under a wrong notion that they had become permanent laws. Thus, the fact 
remains that on the touchstone of the provisions of Articles 89 and 128 read with 
Article 264 of the Constitution and section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, 
only such rights, privileges, obligations, or liabilities would lawfully be protected 
as were acquired, accrued or incurred under the said Ordinances during the 
period of four months or three months, as the case may be, from their 
promulgation, whether before or after 3rd November, 2007, and not thereafter, 
until such Ordinances were enacted as Acts by the Parliament or the concerned 
Provincial Assembly with retrospective effect.  
 
188. In the light of the above, the question of validation of such Ordinances would 
be required to be decided by the Parliament or the concerned Provincial 
Assemblies. However, the period of four months and three months mentioned 
respectively in Articles 89 and 128 of the Constitution would be deemed to 
commence from the date of short order passed in this case on 31st July, 2009 
and steps may be taken to lay such Ordinances before the Parliament or the 
respective Provincial Assemblies in accordance with law during the aforesaid 
periods. This extension of time has been allowed in order to acknowledge the 
doctrine of or trichotomy of powers as enshrined in the Constitution, to preserve 
continuity, to prevent disorder, to protect private rights, the strengthen the 
democratic institutions and to enable them to perform their constitutional 
functions, which they were unconstitutionally and illegally denied under PCO 
No.1 of 2007. Needless to say that any validation whether with retrospective 
effect or otherwise, shall always be subject to judicial review on the well-
recognized principles of ultra vires, non-conformity with the Constitution or 
violation of the Fundamental Rights, or on any other available ground.”  
 
Pursuant to such judgment, through Constitution (Eighteenth 
Amendment) Act, 2010, Article 270AA was enacted; according to which  
ordinances, regulations, enactments, notifications, rules, orders or bye-
laws made between the twelfth day of October, 1999 and the thirty-first 
day of October, 2003 and still in force shall continue to be in force until 
altered, repealed or amended by the competent authority, which clearly 
reflects that though Police Order, 2002 in its original form would remain 
operative until it is amended, altered or repealed by the competent 
authority but the ordinances promulgated thereafter and one referred 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               14 
 
above (2007) are not in the field anymore because it has not been 
placed before the competent authority (Respective Legislature) for 
further validation; therefore, any contention that Articles 103 to 108 of 
the Police Order, 2002 stood repealed is without any force.  
12.    
Police Complaints Authority, independent in nature by its 
composition as per Article 104 of the Police Order, 2002 shall consist of 
a Chairperson and six members. The Governor shall appoint the 
Chairperson of the Provincial Police Complaints Authority whereas the 
Government shall appoint the members of the Provincial Police 
Complaints Authority on the recommendation of the Provincial Public 
Service Commission. Therefore, its establishment is essential for 
running the system smoothly and in accordance with prevailing law. 
Even otherwise it is trite that when a statute describes or requires a 
thing to be done in a particular manner; it should be done in that manner 
or not at all. Functioning of Police Complaints Authority has also been 
focused in cases reported as “HAIDER ALI and another versus DPO 
CHAKWAL” and others (2015 SCMR 1724); “KHIZER HAYAT and others Versus 
INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF POLICE (PUNJAB), LAHORE and others” (PLD 2005 
Lahore 470); “MUBASHIR AHMED Versus S.H.O., POLICE STATION SADDAR, 
GUJRANWALA and 4 others” (2007 P Cr. L J 384). In Haider Ali case 
Supra, The Supreme Court has observed as under; 
 
“It was also noted by us that the systemic accountability forums which were 
created pursuant to the Police Order, 2002, in the form of National and 
Provincial Public Safety Commissions and Police Complaints Authority are 
either inactive or not operational.” 
 
Learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor was directed to establish 
contact with police authorities to know about the establishment of Police 
Complaints Authority, who has informed later that till to date no such 
Authorities have been established. In the situation when after almost 21 
years of the promulgation of Police Order, 2002, no effort was made to 
establish Police Complaints Authority, Provincial Government is directed 
to establish Provincial Police Complaints Authority in accordance with 
the mandate of Articles 103, 104 and 105 of the Police Order, 2002 as 
early as possible but not later than six months. 

                           W.P. No.10957 of 2023                                                               15 
 
13.      The scheme of law discussed above concludes that if a 
complaint of neglect, failure or excess committed by any police 
officer/official is received by the ex-officio Justice of the Peace, he can 
simply pass it to District Police Officer concerned for placing it before the 
Police Complaints Authority who is authorized to channelize it as per 
Article 36 of the Police Order, 2002, or ex-officio justice of the peace can 
direct the aggrieved person to approach the Police Complaints Authority 
by filing an application and further course of action shall be taken care of 
by the said authority under the law. If both the directions are not met,           
ex-officio justice of the Peace can proceed as per law suggested above.  
14.   
Coming to the case in hand, according to which allegation of 
defective investigation has been levelled against the petitioner which 
offence is non-cognizable as highlighted above. I have not found any 
defect in direction passed by ex-officio Justice of the peace for transfer 
of investigation, which does not call for any interference; however, 
direction for registration of FIR under Article 155(1)(c) of the Police 
Order, 2002 is set aside with the direction to concerned SHO to enter 
information in a register, maintained u/s 155 of Cr.P.C. and proceed 
strictly in accordance with law so as to investigate the matter, if 
permission is granted by the Magistrate, for further course of action as 
suggested above including filing of reference before Anti-Corruption 
establishment if substance of allegation coupled with material so 
requires. With these observations, this petition stands disposed of.   
15. 
Copy of this order be sent to the Chief Secretary, Government 
of the Punjab, for compliance.
