Petitioner by:

Respondents by: 
M/s Muhammad Ibrahim Khan and 
Shoaib Iqbal, Advocates  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through instant 
petition, petitioner has assailed vires of judgments and decrees dated 
07.3.2009 passed by learned Civil Judge, Ist Class, whereby suit for 
possession through pre-emption filed by respondents No.1 to 6 was 
decreed and judgment and decree dated 28.10.2009 passed by learned 
Addl. District Judge, Bahawalnagar, whereby appeal filed by the 
petitioner was dismissed. 
2. 
Briefly stated the facts of the case are that predecessor of 
respondents No.1-A to 1-F/Mehnga Khan instituted a suit for 
possession through pre-emption against petitioner and respondents 
No.2 to 5 regarding agricultural land, detailed in Para-1 of the plaint, 
by contending that Mst. Rashida Begum entered into oral sale mutation 
No.468 attested on 30.12.2003 with defendants against an ostensible 
price of Rs.8,20,000/- in order to defeat his superior right of pre-
emption. The plaint duly contains the contents regarding alleged 
performance of Talb-i-Muwathibat and Talb-i-Ishhad. During 

2 
C.R. No.80-D of 2010 
proceedings of the suit, the defendants/ respondents No.2 to 5 made 
statement regarding partial decree of the suit whereas petitioner 
contested the suit. Learned Trial Court vide judgment and decree dated 
07.3.2009 decreed the suit in the following terms:- 
“The contention of the Province of Punjab is that the Province of 
Punjab is still the owner of the suit land and proprietary rights of the 
suit land have not been conferred. As the parties to the lis have 
entered into compromise and the defendants have got recorded their 
statements regarding the partial decree of this suit. In such 
circumstances, the transfer of the land in favour of the plaintiffs 
would be subject to all limitations and formalities as mentioned by the 
province of Punjab in his written statement and the plaintiffs would be 
stepping into the shoes of vendee/defendants. As such, suit of the 
plaintiffs for pre-emption is hereby partially decreed to the extent of 
16-kanals comprising square No.60 Qilla No.5-2 Kanal 12 Marlas, 
Qilla No.6, 2 Kanals 12 Marlas, Qilla No.15, 2 Kanal 12 Marlas, Qilla 
NO.6, 6 Kanals 12 Marlas and Qilla No.17, 1 Kanal 12 Marlas. While, 
their remaining prayer is turned down. The plaintiffs are also entitled 
to collect Zar-e-Soam deposited by them. Decree sheet be drawn. 
File be consigned to the record room.” 
 
Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner preferred an appeal, which was 
dismissed by the learned Addl. District Judge, Bahawalnagar vide 
judgment and decree dated 28.10.2009. Hence, this revision petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioner contends that land in question is 
not pre-emptable being a colony land, thus, suit was not maintainable 
and impugned judgments and decrees are unsustainable in the eye of 
law.  
4. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents has 
supported the impugned judgments and decrees.  
  
When confronted as to how right of pre-emption can be claimed 
when the property vests with the Province of Punjab, learned counsel 
for respondents submits that suit has been decreed after proving 
performance of Talb-i-Ishhad and Talb-i-Muwathibat.  
5. 
The law that governed the relationship between the State and the 
tenants over State land prior to the Colonization of Government 
(Punjab) Lands Act, 1912 (“the Act of 2012”), was the Government 
Tenants (Punjab) Act, 1893. However, it was repealed vide section 2 of 
the Act of 1912. The legal provision corresponding to sections 18 and 

3 
C.R. No.80-D of 2010 
19 of the Act of 1912 was contained in section 8 of the Repealed Act of 
1893. Section 19 of the Act of 1912 is a more elaborate provision in 
relation to transfer of tenancy rights declaring the same to be void 
without the previous consent in writing of the Commissioner or by such 
officers as he may by written order empower in this behalf. It is, 
therefore, important that any transfer of tenancy rights be exercised 
strictly in accordance with the spirit of law as envisaged under this 
section. 
6. 
The scheme of the Act of 2012 indicates that right to acquire 
property is a grant by the government and the government has the 
power to allot or refuse allotment of a property. The discretion of 
government to select the person as transferee of colony land is so 
important that even the original allottee cannot transfer or sell the land 
in his occupation to a third person without obtaining permission by the 
Collector under Section 19 of the Act, which provides that  rights or 
interests vested in a tenant cannot be transferred without written 
consent of the Commissioner. Admittedly, in the instant case, order 
under section 19 was obtained while entering into transaction between 
Mst. Rashida and respondents No.2 to 5, and this fact was admitted and 
duly narrated by plaintiff in the plaint of suit in question. 
7. 
Similarly, the cases of tenants under the Schemes where there is 
an inbuilt concept of conferment of proprietary rights to the extent 
provided in the Scheme would also be covered subject to continuance 
of the tenancies as per terms and conditions governing them. Therefore, 
all Government grants are required to take effect according to their 
tenor in the statement of conditions governing them. It is difficult to 
press into service a right of tenant other than that enforceable under the 
law in accordance with the statement of conditions providing for the 
same. Such a right or a vested interest in terms of section 19 of the Act 
of 1912 is created in a tenant on the examination of his eligibility for 
conferment of proprietary rights in his favour. As a necessary 
consequence so long as a property in colony area is owned by the 
Government and not by a private party, any transaction done under 

4 
C.R. No.80-D of 2010 
section 19 of the Act of 1912 would not be pre-emptible. Even 
otherwise the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Muhammad Aslam and 
others v. Shabbir Ahmad and others” (PLD 2003 SC 588) held that 
owing to the non-withdrawal by the Government of Punjab of 
Notification No.74 dated 12.06.1944 issued by the Government of 
Bahawalpur, the land in colony area falling within the ambit of the Act 
of 1912 remains non-pre-emptible. 
8. 
Needless to say that right to occupy land can neither be acquired 
by automatic sale nor by substitution because in case of substitution, 
which is the right of pre-emption, the provisions of section 19 are 
violated. In nutshell, a right to acquire or purchase property in colony 
area is a right specifically permitted by the government and it cannot be 
substituted by ignoring the provisions of section 19 of the Act of 1912. 
If not susceptible to substitution, the obvious conclusion would be that 
any such transaction is not pre-emptible. Reliance is made on cases law 
reported as “Muhammad Aslam and others v. Shabbir Ahmad and 
others” (PLD 2003 SC 588), “Abdul Majeed through L.Rs and others v. 
Sher Din through L.Rs.” (2015 SCMR 620), “Mst. Rehmat Bibi v. 
Nathe Khan and others” (PLD 1969 SC 197) and “Muhammad 
Siddique and others v. Muhammad Sharif and others” (2012 SCMR 
1387) 
9. 
In view of above, this petition is allowed and impugned 
judgments and decrees of the Courts below are hereby set aside. 
Consequently, suit of respondents for possession through pre-emption 
stands dismissed.
