ASIM HAFEEZ, J.  
Present and other petitioners, claimed to 
be the bidders, hereby invoked constitutional jurisdiction inter alia 
for seeking declarations against alleged actions/directions of the 
procuring agency(ies), issued in the course of tendering process 
initiated for awarding of civil works in various districts of 
southern part of province of Punjab. Fundamentally, and in 
common, the grievance is directed against demand made by the 
procuring agency, directing the petitioners – [a distinct class of 
bidders] -, to furnish “Quality Assurance Security” (‘QAS’) or 
“Quality Control Guarantee” („QCG‟) – nomenclature of the 
security(ies) demanded vary from case to case but raison d`être 
thereof indicates commonality. And likewise, quantum of 
security(ies) demanded in each case varies, depending upon the 
financial outlay of the tendered work(s). 
  
Some of the petitioners, alternatively or additionally, laid a 
conduit challenge, seeking declarations against the directions of 
the procuring agency, whereby option of arranging security(ies) 
from Insurance companies was dismissed and instead securities 
issued by the Banks were declared acceptable. And decision of 
limiting the options / choices is questioned on the premise that it 
offends fundamentals of prevalent procurement regime, embodied 
in and enforced through Punjab Procurement Regulatory Authority 
Act, 2009 (“Act of 2009”) and Punjab Procurement Rules, 2014 
(“Rules of 2014”). 
2. 
Reasons and context of assumption of constitutional 
jurisdiction by this Division Bench are explained infra, while 
explaining the perspective of controversy raised. At the outset, it is 
pertinent to highlight that issues raised and pleaded do not qualify 
as disputes of first impression, rather aptly put, the controversy is 
old but cosmetically presented in a different shade. Simply, the 
semantic changes in some of the expression(s), referred then and 
now, are the cause of present proceedings, for instance, previously 

W.P. No.2009/2024 
3
expression employed was “Additional Performance Security”, 
which is altered to QAS or QCG. Though, seemingly, both 
expressions are linguistically dissimilar but, for the purposes of 
controversy at hand, expressions, in fact, complement each other 
in achieving the common objective / goal, which is to deal with 
contingency where bidder had quoted prices lower than the 
estimated cost of the works / project tendered. Previously, learned 
Division Bench principally affirmed mutually exclusiveness of 
additional performance security and performance guarantee, 
referred under Rule 56 of the Rules, 2014, while deciding the case 
of A.M. Construction Company (Private) Limited V. Province of 
Punjab through Secretary Communication and Works Department 
and others (2023 CLC 616) – during submissions we are informed 
that said decision was assailed before Hon‟ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan by the department(s)/procuring agency and by the bidders 
as well, matters were heard but no decision was announced to the 
best of information communicated.  
  
In above-referred decision, substantially the controversy was 
that whether the procuring agency was lawfully entitled to demand 
additional performance security, in addition to the requirement of 
performance guarantee, and if such demand was contrary to the 
mandate of the law and rules. The context and rational of demand of 
additional performance security needs to be understood. Additional 
performance security was demanded only from such class of bidders, 
who had quoted bid price lower than the estimated cost, assessed by 
the procuring agency regarding tendered works and indicated in the 
advertisement. And quantum of additional performance security was 
restricted to the extent of the difference between quoted price and 
estimated cost – ratios for ascertaining difference were provided in 
clause 26-A of the standard contract form. It is evident that through 
Notification of 16.11.2022, a new expression „Quality Assurance 
Security‟ was introduced, but it certainly meant to cover differential 
amount. Primary ground of attack was that demand of additional 

W.P. No.2009/2024 
4
performance security was contrary to Rule 56 of the Rules, 2014, 
which required provisioning of performance guarantee, to the extent 
of 10% of the contract price. In this backdrop, case of A.M. 
Construction Company (Private) Limited (supra) was decided, 
whereby additional performance security and performance guarantee 
were treated as distinct specie of securities. After aforesaid decision, 
fresh tenders were floated, and bids submitted were considered for 
ascertaining their responsiveness. Again, it was found that certain 
bidders had quoted bid price(s) lower than the estimated cost, which 
bidders were directed to provide Quality Assurance Security - 
covering the difference in the quoted price and estimated cost. 
Disputes, by and large of similar kind, again surfaced and 
departmental demand was questioned through invoking judicial 
review jurisdiction. One of such constitutional petition, bearing W.P 
No. 11476/2023, was disposed of on 24.07.2023 in terms of the 
observations recorded in the case of A.M. Construction Company 
(Private) Limited. Appeal bearing ICA No.209/2023 was preferred 
by the department, which is pending adjudication and heard along 
other petitions. In meanwhile learned Single Benches, occupied with 
petitions of similar nature, sought placement of cases before Division 
Bench on the premise that issues raised possessed proximity with the 
questions already decided in the case of A.M. Construction Company 
(Private) Limited (supra). Needful was done after fulfilling the 
requirements. 
3.  
It is apt to explain relevance and context of other petitions, 
whereby directions of the procuring agency denying option of 
arranging securities from the Insurance companies were 
challenged. All those petitions came up for hearing before learned 
Judge(s)-in-Chamber(s). It is pertinently pointed that dispute(s) 
regarding acceptability of specific kind of security earlier came up 
before Judge-in-Chambers at principal seat, through petition bearing 
W.P. No.23988/2022, titled “M/s Jalal Construction Company V. 
The Secretary C&W Department, Government of Punjab and 3 

W.P. No.2009/2024 
5
others”, which along other connected matters, was decided through 
judgment dated 09.01.2024, judgment was numbered as (2024 LHC 
329) and can be accessed at https://www.lhc.gov.pk. To avoid 
conflicting decisions petitions were consolidated and placed before 
this Division Bench, after fulfilling the requirements. 
4. 
After giving bird‟s eye view of the controversy, decided 
earlier but re-packaged, and explaining funneling of petitions before 
Division Bench, we proceed to discuss the ratio of the decision in the 
case of A.M. Construction Company (Private) Limited (supra) in the 
context of demand for furnishing QAS or QCG securities. It is 
appropriate to reproduce operative part of the decision of A.M. 
Construction Company (Private) Limited, which reads as, 
 
“ORDER OF THE COURT. 
(i) 
Demand of additional performance security under Para 26(A) of the 
General Directions is not violative of rule 56 of the Rules. 
(ii) 
In all those petitions/appeal, where the lowest bidder did not become 
successful bidder, the performance security or additional performance 
security under Para 26(A) of the General Directions could be 
demanded in terms thereof and rule 56 of the Rules had no bearing on 
such performance/ additional performance securities.  
(iii) 
However, if the lower bidder acquired the status of a successful bidder, 
then performance security or even additional performance security 
shall be governed by Rule 56 of the Rules and no payment of 
performance security or additional performance security could be 
demanded beyond the limit of 10% of the “contract price” prescribed 
in Rule 56 of the Rules.  
(iv) 
In case no performance security or additional performance security as 
per Para 26(A) of the General Directions was provided by the lowest 
bidder, the procuring agency was within its right to reject the bid under 
Paras 15 and 26(B) of the General Directions read with rule 35 of the 
Rules”. 
5. 
Learned counsel submit that demand of furnishing QAS or 
QCG securities offends the mandate of the Rule 56 of the Rules, 
2014 – this was the same argument raised and addressed in the case 
of A.M. Construction Company (Private) Limited (supra). Learned 
counsels iterated that other than performance guarantee no other 
security could be lawfully demanded – not to mention bid security, 
which is not in dispute in these petitions. Learned counsels 
emphasized that petitioners were the lowest bidders and subjecting 

W.P. No.2009/2024 
6
them to additional security is unwarranted. Submits that mere change 
in the nomenclature of expression additional performance security 
through Quality Assurance Security, through Notification of 
16.11.2022, was designed to defeat the decision in the case of A.M. 
Construction Company (Private) Limited.  
6. 
On the point of restriction imposed qua the specific kind of 
security to be provided for securing contractual obligations, it is 
argued that purpose of denying the option of arranging guarantee 
from Insurance companies is discriminatory, intended to exclude 
contractors with limited capital and resources and dole out contracts 
to few blue-eyed contractors. Adds that limiting the acceptance of 
securities from Banks only would negate the fundamental principles 
of 
procurement, 
discourage 
inclusiveness 
and 
competition. 
Reference is made to the decisions handed down by Hon‟ble 
Baluchistan High Court, Quetta, in cases of Constructors Association of 
Pakistan through Secretary General and 4 others V. Government of Balochistan 
through Secretary, Communication Department, Quetta and 8 others (PLD 
2024 Balochistan 23) and an unreported judgment dated 04.08.2022 
passed in Constitution Petition No.1185/2022 titled as M/s Saad Ullah Khan 
& brothers V. The Secretary Irrigation Department Government of Balochistan 
& another. In the judgments referred various clauses of Baluchistan 
Public Procurement Rules, 2014 and bidding documents were 
declared invalid, upon being declared as inconsistent with the advice 
of the Executive Committee of National Economic Council 
(ECNEC) and conditions of bidding documents drafted by Pakistan 
Engineering Council (PEC). 
7. 
Learned Law Officer, while elucidating the operative part of 
decision in the case of A.M. Construction Company (Private) 
Limited, submits that the observations recorded therein are 
misconstrued and confusion is deliberately created by misreading the 
expressions employed and reasoning extended to distinguish 
additional performance security from performance guarantee. 
Contends that additional security is demanded for covering 

W.P. No.2009/2024 
7
difference between quoted price and estimated cost of the works 
tendered. It is explained that quoting of price lower than estimated 
cost meant to outshine genuine, experienced and serious bidders, and 
sole purpose was to grab the contract. Adds that this adventurism 
was checked by directing submission of additional performance 
security to the extent of the differentials only. And requirement of 
performance guarantee is independent. Learned law officer 
emphasized on the discretion vested in procuring agency to decide 
that what kind of security is required and in order to standardize it, 
directives were issued to stop receiving guarantees from Insurance 
companies and only securities arranged from the Banks are 
considered as permissible kind of security. Representatives / learned 
counsels for procuring agency argued that instructions by ECNEC 
cannot claim preference against procurement laws, legislated by the 
Provincial Government. Adds that recommendations of ECNEC are 
otherwise administrative and advisory. Reference is made to the 
decision in the case of Peshawar Electric Supply Company Ltd 
(PESCO) and another V. SS Polypropylene (Pvt.) Ltd., Peshawar 
and others (PLD 2023 Supreme Court 316). 
8. 
Arguments heard  
9. 
Some 
factual 
narration 
is 
essential 
to contextualize 
controversy. Advertisement(s) issued for inviting bids contained 
condition regarding requirement of furnishing QAS or QCG, if some 
difference is found between quoted price and estimated cost of 
tendered works. It is misconception to confuse performance 
guarantee and security demanded under clauses 26(A) & 26(B) of 
the conditions of Standard Contract Form, which clauses are 
reproduced for ease of reference, 
“General Direction No.26(A). In case the total tendered 
amount is equal to or less than 5% of the approved 
estimated (DNIT) amount, the lowest bidder will have to 
deposit quality assurance security from the scheduled Bank 
equal to the amount of difference between approved DNIT 
amount and the quoted bid amount as given below, within 

W.P. No.2009/2024 
8
15 days of issuance of notice or with in expiry period of bid, 
whichever is earlier. 
26.(b) Lowest evaluated bidder shall, within 15 days of 
receipt by him of a notice in this regard, furnish to the 
tender approving authority in cash, bank draft, cashiers 
cheque, payment order or bank guarantied (valid for three 
months beyond completion time/extended completion time) 
from any scheduled bank of Pakistan, the amount to make 
up performance security and/or additional performance 
security where required and specified in the tender in item 
(h) of memorandum of work. Should the lowest evaluated 
bidder refuse or fail for any reason to furnish the 
performance security within the specified time, it should 
constitute a just cause for rejection of his tender and in the 
event of such rejection the entire earnest money shall be 
forfeited to government as compensation for such default”.   
10. 
Securities demand, in lieu of occurrence of difference in 
quoted price and estimated cost, manifest a distinct class of security, 
different from the scope and requirement of performance guarantee. 
Not every bidder is asked to furnish additional securities - QAS or 
QCG - but only those bidders whose quoted bid prices are lower 
than declared estimated cost. This odd situation raises a red flag. In 
fact, additional security is in the nature of contingency security, 
requirement whereof triggers in case of differential. Additional 
security is solicited to hedge the exposure of the procuring agency 
and risks. This position is explained with an illustration. A contract 
is advertised, wherein estimated cost of the works was assessed at 
Rs.10.00 Million. A, a bidder, quotes bid of Rs.11.00 Million – no 
occasion for submission of additional security arises and if A‟s bid is 
found lowest evaluated bid, contract would be awarded and then A 
was required to furnish performance guarantee. B, another bidder, 
quotes bid price of Rs.7.00 Million against estimated cost of 
Rs.10.00 Million. B‟s bid is apparently the lowest bid but lower than 
estimated cost – exposure encountered was the differential of 
Rs.3.00 Million. B is required to submit additional security to the 
extent of the exposure of the procuring agency to the extent of 
Rs.3.00 Million. B cannot lay claim to the contract on account of 
being the lowest bidder unless additional security is submitted. And 
till additional security is not submitted bid offered cannot be 

W.P. No.2009/2024 
9
classified as responsive – under Rule 2 (aa) of the Rules, 2014 
“responsive, means qualified for consideration on the basis of 
declared evaluation criteria and specified in the bid document or in 
the request for proposal”. Once additional security is provided then 
the bid would be available for consideration. Acceptance of bid is 
next stage. An adjective, „successful‟, is added to the status of lowest 
bidder, provided the occasion arises and additional security 
demanded is submitted, upon acceptance of bid. Once bid was 
accepted and contract awarded, then the contractor was required to 
furnish performance guarantee – which for all intent and purposes is 
an independent security. Bidder B is a distinct class of bidders, in the 
context of contingency of the differential in quoted price and 
estimated cost.  
11. 
Submission that lowest quoted bid would per se make bidder 
successful and eligible for the award of contract is fallacious. In the 
context of present controversy, bid, whereby quoted price was lower 
than the estimated cost, is not responsive in the first place. Bidder 
with lowest quote is directed to provide the security for covering the 
differential – at that point of time there is no relevance of 
performance guarantee. If bidder meets the contingency and furnish 
requisite security, in the kind as directed, only then the bid would be 
classified as “lowest evaluated bid”. And unless contingency is met, 
no occasion for acceptance of bid arises, notwithstanding howsoever 
lowest the quote was. Once condition is fulfilled, the bid is accepted 
and contract awarded, when status of the bidder elevates to the 
contractor, who is then obligated to provide performance guarantee. 
Bid will be accepted only once it is found responsive, and it cannot 
be treated as responsive unless the security demanded, for the 
difference between quoted price and estimated cost, is provided. 
Only upon acceptance of lowest evaluated bid an adjective 
“successful” is added to the credit of bidder. This is the reasoning of 
decision in the case of “Messers GHULAM MUHAMMAD & SONS 
v. WATER AND SANITATION AGENCY (WASA) FAISALABAD 

W.P. No.2009/2024 
10
through Director General and others” (2022 MLD 1216) and 
affirmed by Division Bench is the case of A.M. Construction 
Company (Private) Limited (supra). Reasoning extended in the case 
of A.M. Construction Company (Private) Limited need to be 
construed in the context of aforesaid illustration, for understanding 
rational, plausibility and commercial prudence of demanding 
additional security. Mere use of the expression „additional 
performance security‟ in the operative part of the decision of A.M. 
Construction Company (Private) Limited would not obliterate or 
diminish the ratio decidendi of the decision. Judgment has to be 
interpreted in the context of its reasoning. We opine that takeaway 
from the decision in case of A.M. Construction Company (Private) 
Limited (supra) was the declaration contained in clause (i) of the 
operative part of the decision. Observations in rest of the 
paragraphs, from (ii) to (iv), are specific to the facts of the cases 
decided, which have had no precedential value and treated as mere 
obiter. It is reiterated that Rule 56 of the Rules, 2014 will not be 
construed or read to obliterate the option of calling for additional 
security, whenever the difference in the quoted price and estimated 
cost occurs. And furnishing of quality assurance security will not 
absolve the bidder-cum-contractor from furnishing performance 
guarantee to the maximum of 10% of the contract price, envisaged 
under Rule 56 of the Rules, 2014. Rule 34 of the Rules, 2014 is not 
attracted. No element of discrimination is pointed. In fact, absolving 
bidders from the obligation of providing additional security, where 
quoted bid is found lower than estimated cost, would tantamount to 
inverse discrimination with other category of bidders.        
12. 
Now we take up the issue relating limiting the acceptability of 
security by the Banks, for the purposes of QAS or QCG security(ies) 
and / or performance guarantee. We confronted learned counsels to 
refer to any provision in the Act, 2009 and Rules, 2014 which 
extends discretion or option to the bidder to pick security of its 
choice and convenience, and instead learned counsels, referred to 

W.P. No.2009/2024 
11
clause 10.1 of Standard Bidding Document, drafted by Pakistan 
Engineering Council (PEC). Clause 10.1 had no application in wake 
of prevalent procurement regime in province of Punjab. There is no 
cavil that preference to a particular kind of security depends on 
various factors, which factors have had to be considered by the 
procuring agency and any decision taken calls for showing deference. 
There is no cavil that picking a form of security is a policy decision, 
which exercise of discretion is not amenable to constitutional 
jurisdiction, otherwise. Be that as it may, provisioning of security 
from Insurance companies is not permissible anymore. Question 
requiring consideration is whether act of limiting choice of security 
conflicts with prevalent procurement regime. No particular clause is 
referred to show any conflict or violation for limiting choice of 
acceptability of a specific kind of security. Judgments in cases of 
Constructors Association of Pakistan through Secretary General and 
4 others and M/s Saad Ullah Khan & brothers had no application in 
the context of procurement regime, operative in the Province of 
Punjab. Under the present procurement regime, an Authority has 
been constituted through section 3 of the Punjab Procurement 
Regulatory Authority Act, 2009, which Authority is entrusted with 
the functions of preparing standard document to be used in 
connection with public procurement - [Section 5-(h)]. Authority, in 
exercise of powers under section 29 of the Act, 2009 and Rule 25(5) 
of Rules, 2014 framed Standard Bidding Documents for 
Procurement of Civil Works, wherein acceptable security was 
identified in shape of Bank guarantee/ CDR/ Demand Draft, etc. and 
not the securities from the Insurance Companies. Accordingly, 
changes were made in standard contract form. 
13. 
Argument that instructions of ECNEC for extending 
preference to standard bidding documents drafted by PEC is biding 
and claim superiority vis-à-vis the prevalent procurement regime is 
misconceived. Instructions, though notified, does not restrict or 
impede the enforcement of public procurement regime envisaged 

W.P. No.2009/2024 
12
under the auspicious of Act, 2009 and Rules, 2014. Instructions, 
having advisory status cannot be construed to undermine the 
provincial autonomy and effective enforcement of procurement 
regime in Punjab. No jurisdictional objection is pleaded qua the 
powers of the Authority to draft sample bidding documents and tasks 
assigned to the procuring agency. Government of Punjab had 
introduced contract form for the guidance of the bidders and for 
regulating procurement matters. Violation recorded of any provision 
of the Act, 2009, Rules, 2014, regulations, orders or instructions 
made there-under, attracts mis-procurement. Notably, no facial 
challenge has been thrown qua the constitutionality of Act, 2009 and 
Rules, 2014 – no issue of legislative competence of the Province of 
Punjab to legislate is raised. And as-applied challenge to the 
application of various provisions of Act, 2009 and Rules, 2014 also 
fails. The instructions of ECNEC cannot be elevated to the standard 
of a legislative enactment for the purposes of conferring preferability 
under Article 143 of the Constitution. Scope of Article 143 of the 
Constitution has been misconstrued in the judgments referred. 
Petitioners‟ side failed to refer any entry in the Federal Legislative 
Schedule to disqualify the provinces from legislating on the subject 
of procurement matters. There is another aspect regarding 
applicability of standard bidding documents framed by PEC. 
Regulation 3 of the Public Procurement Regulations, 2008 – framed 
in exercise of powers under section 27 of the Public Procurement 
Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 – directs the procuring 
agency to use standard form of bidding documents prescribed by 
PEC. Regulation 3, ibid, has no relevance and applicability in the 
context of Act, 2009 or the Rules, 2014, wherein no provision 
parallel to Regulation 3 is pointed. There is nothing in the Act or the 
Rules that circumvents the power of the Government, Authority and 
procuring agency to frame policy guidelines, issue instructions and 
orders for making procurement efficient, economical and transparent. 
The judgments referred are not attracted in the context of provisions 
of Act of 2009 and Rules of 2014. 

W.P. No.2009/2024 
13
14. 
With assistance of the leaned counsels we read various 
portions of the decision in the case of “M/s Jalal Construction 
Company, (supra), relevant paragraphs are reproduced hereunder: 
“27. It follows from the above that the Authority in exercise of its lawful 
powers under the PPRA Act, 2009 read with the Rules, 2014 has 
developed SBDs for use of all procuring agencies including Local 
Governments in the Province of Punjab which exclude insurance bond / 
guarantee from an insurance company as a form of security. Thus, in the 
context of the Province of Punjab, the decision of ECNEC dated 
12.11.2007 and Notification of the Planning Commission, Government of 
Pakistan dated 12.02.2008 to use SBDs of PEC has lost its relevance as 
express provisions of law preempt an administrative decision. However, 
it is reiterated that even otherwise exclusion of insurance bond / 
guarantee from an insurance company as a form of guarantee is not in 
conflict with the decision of ECNEC as SBDs of PEC also permit the 
same. The 21 W. P. No. 23988 / 2022 directions of ECNEC to use SBDs 
of PEC, in essence, requires the use of standard contracts in the 
procurement process which purpose has been achieved by the Authority 
under the PPRA Act, 2009.  
28. The upshot of the above discussion is that exclusion of insurance 
bond / guarantee as a form of security by the procuring agencies of the 
Federal Government and the Provincial Government of Punjab with 
respect to performance or additional performance / quality assurance 
guarantee is permissible in terms of lawful discretion of a procuring 
agency provided it is specifically stated in the SBDs. The bidders who 
participate in the bidding process, subject to bidding documents, have no 
vested right to tender securities in a particular form of their choice that 
is not part of the SBDs of a procuring agency as they knowingly 
participate in a bidding process in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the SBDs. Moreover, as exclusion of insurance bond / 
guarantee indiscriminately applies to all bidders with reference to a 
particular bidding process, no case of discrimination is made out. The 
objection qua exercise of constitutional jurisdiction with respect to 
contractual matters is overruled as it is well settled that where facts 
emanating from contractual disputes are admitted, constitutional 
jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution can be exercised. 
29 
……. 
(iv) In the Province of Punjab, the Authority set up under the PPRA Act, 
2009 read with the Rules, 2014 is legally empowered to devise SBDs 
which have been duly made and notified, as such, all procuring agencies 
including Local Governments in the Province of Punjab are obliged to 
use SBDs prepared by the Authority under the PPRA Act, 2009. Hence, 
the conscious act of exclusion of insurance bond / guarantee from an 
insurance company as a form of security with respect to performance or 
additional performance / quality assurance security is valid and the 
bidders are obliged to take part in the procurement process in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the SBDs”.  
15. 
We concur with the ratio laid in the case of “M/s Jalal 
Construction Company, to the extent of the findings recorded and 
conclusions reached regarding provincial procurement regime, which 

W.P. No.2009/2024 
14
is the domain of challenge under all petitions before us. No 
comments are made with respect to Federal Procurement laws and 
procurement laws of other provinces.  
16. 
In view of aforesaid, this and other constitutional petitions and 
Intra Court Appeal, listed in Annexure-A, hereto attached, are 
disposed of in following terms: 
a)  
Findings recorded in clause (i) of operative part 
of decision in case of A.M. Construction Company 
(Private) Limited are endorsed.  
b) 
Demand 
for 
arranging 
Quality 
Assurance 
Security or for that matter the Quality Control 
Guarantee, where applicable and subject to the amount 
ascertained, does not conflict with the requirement of 
procuring performance guarantee, in terms of rule 56 of 
the Rules, 2014. Furnishing of additional security would 
not absolve the lowest evaluated bidder, identified as 
successful 
bidder 
in 
common 
parlance, 
from 
provisioning of the performance guarantee.  
c)  
Exclusion of arranging security from Insurance 
companies is policy matter decision. We hold that such 
exclusion applied does not violate the mandate of the 
public procurement regime, prevalent in the province of 
Punjab. 
d)  
Decision in the case of “M/s Jalal Construction 
Company, to the extent of the findings recorded and 
conclusions reached therein regarding the prevalent 
provincial procurement regime are endorsed.
