[No.56073/2020] as well as Writ Petition No.56076/2020 as both 
these cases have been filed against the consolidated order passed 
by the Member, Board of Revenue. 
2.  
Brief facts of the titled Writ Petition [No.56073/2020] are 
that the petitioner/Bakhsh obtained state Charagah land bearing 
Lot No.2 Khasra No.59/3/2, 4, 7, 8/1, 13/2, 14 to 17, 18/1, 23/2,

No.41/4-L Tehsil & District Okara under 05 years lease scheme 
on 05.10.1995 for a period from Kharif 1995 to Rabi 2000. Due 
to non-payment of lagaan, the lease was cancelled by the District 
Collector on 24.06.2000. The petitioner challenged the said order 
through an appeal which was dismissed by the Executive District 
Officer (Revenue), Okara vide order dated 16.03.2005. 
Thereafter, the petitioner filed application for purchase of the 
state land through private treaty.

Brief facts of the Writ Petition No.56076/202 are that the 
petitioner/Noor Muhammad obtained state Charagah land under 
05 years lease scheme bearing Lot No.4 Khasra No.54/11/2, 12/2 
& 13/4 measuring 01 Acre 02 Kanal 17 Marla situated in Chak 
No.41/4-L Tehsil & District Okara on 05.10.1995 for a period of 
Kharif 1995 to Rabi 2000. Due to non-payment of lagaan, the 
lease was cancelled by the District Collector on 24.06.2000. The 
petitioner challenged the said order through an appeal which was 
dismissed by the Executive District Officer (Revenue), Okara 
vide order dated 10.05.2005. Thereafter, the petitioner/Noor 
Muhammad also filed application for purchase of the state land 
through private treaty. The respondents No.3 & 4 also filed 
separate applications for lease of state land to them under 
Lambardari Grant. The District Collector, Okara consolidated the 
aforesaid four applications of the petitioners as well as 
respondents No.3 & 4 and vide consolidated order dated 
08.05.2012 dismissed the applications of petitioners [Bukhsh and 
Noor Muhammad] for purchase of the state land through private 
treaty and allotted the land measuring 72 Kanal 02 Marla bearing 
Lot No.2 to Khadim Hussain Lambardar (respondent No.3) as 
well as allotted lot measuring 01 Acre 02 Kanal 17 Marla to Ali 
Sher Lambardar [respondent No.4].  
  
The petitioners [Bukhsh and Noor Muhammad] assailed 
the said order through separate appeals before the Additional 
Commissioner (Revenue), Sahiwal Division, Sahiwal who vide 
order dated 18.07.2013 partly allowed the said appeals holding 
the allotments to the Lambardars (respondents No.3 & 4) as 
illegal and cancelled the same by directing the District Collector 
to send a reference to the Board of Revenue for exclusion of the 
land from Lambardari Grant.  

 
W.P.No.56073/2020

The petitioners [Bukhsh and Noor Muhammad] as well as 
respondents No.3 & 4 assailed the aforesaid orders through four 
separate revision petitions and one review application. The 
Member, Board of Revenue vide consolidated order dated 
07.03.2016 upheld the orders dated 18.07.2013 passed by the 
Additional Commissioner (Revenue), Sahiwal Division and 
disposed of the ROR No.2006/2013 titled as Khadim Hussain Vs. 
Bakhsh etc., ROR No.2007/2013 titled as Ali Sher Vs. Noor 
Muhammad etc. and dismissed the ROR No.2002/2013 titled as 
Noor Muhammad Vs. The State, ROR No. No.2004/2013 titled 
as Bakhsh Vs. The State alongwith review petition No.449/2014 
titled as Khadim Hussain etc. Vs. Noor Muhammad.  
 
Khadim Hussain and Ali Sher [respondents No.3 & 4] 
filed review petitions No.190 & 191 of 2016 which were 
accepted by the Member, Board of Revenue vide order dated 
10.09.2020, the consolidated order dated 07.03.2016 passed in 
revision petitions of the parties was recalled and by setting aside 
the order dated 18.07.2013 passed by the Additional 
Commissioner (Revenue), Sahiwal Division the order dated 
08.05.2012 passed by the District Collector, Okara was upheld. 
Hence, these two writ petitions. 
3. 
I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have 
gone through the record. 
4. 
Admittedly, the suit land [bearing Lot No.2 Khasra 
No.59/3/2, 4, 7, 8/1, 13/2, 14 to 17, 18/1, 23/2, 24/1 & 25/1 
measuring 72 Kanal 02 Marla and bearing Lot No.4 Khasra 
No.54/11/2, 12/2 & 13/4 measuring 01 Acre 02 Kanal 17 Marla 
situated in Chak No.41/4-L Tehsil & District Okara] is Charagah 
land which was given to the petitioners on 05 years lease from 
Kharif 1995 to Rabi 2000. The said lease was not further 
extended and after cancellation of the lease, the land was resumed 

 
W.P.No.56073/2020

in favour of the state vide order dated 10.05.2005 passed by the 
District Collector, Okara. The appeals of the petitioners were also 
dismissed thus the petitioners were no more tenants/lessees over 
the land in question and after expiry/cancellation of lease, the 
possession of the petitioners over the said land is that of an illegal 
nature. It is well settled that law always leans in favour of the law 
abiding persons and lends nil support to the illegal occupants, 
usurpers, transgressors, encroachers and grabbers of the State 
land. Reliance is placed on the case titled as Fazal ur Rehman & 
Others Vs. Province of Punjab through District Officer (Revenue) 
Bhakkar & Another (2014 SCMR 1351), wherein the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:- 
“It is argued by the learned counsel that the petitioner had a 40 
years possession over the land in question; therefore, he had 
been dispossessed in violation of section 32 of the 
Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912. We 
are not inclined because admittedly no document exists in 
favour of the petitioner to establish his claim to remain in 
occupation of the property in dispute. Learned counsel stated 
that an application has been moved before the Board of 
Revenue for the proprietary rights. We are not inclined 
because in our considered opinion this argument had not been 
advanced earlier at any stage and it was not the case of the 
petitioner in any manner. Contrary to it, it strengthens the plea 
of the respondent that the petitioner was an unauthorized 
occupant. We may add that the law lean towards persons who 
believe in the rule of law and not those who takes that law in 
their hands as happened in the instant case where the petitioner 
with no legal authority had occupied the premises in dispute. 
As far as the question that he was in possession for so many 
years is concerned, it can never be a ground for the purpose of 
proprietary rights. The petitioner has failed to establish his 
case in his favour. The learned High Court had rightly declined 
to exercise its revisional jurisdiction and maintained the orders 
of the Courts below, thus, we find no merit in this petition 
which is, therefore, dismissed and leave to appeal is declined. 
However if the petitioner has any claim for damages he is free 
to approach the competent forum for redressal of his 
grievance.”  
Similar principle has been reiterated in the case titled as 
Muhammad Sharif through L.Rs Vs. Province of Punjab through 
District Officer Revenue, Pakpattan (2014 SCMR 334). In a case 

 
W.P.No.56073/2020 
 
5
titled as “Shazia Gillani etc. Vs. Board of Revenue, Punjab, 
Lahore through Member Colonies, etc.” (in C.P. No.732-L of 
2016) the Hon’ble Supreme Court has refused to protect the 
possession of usurpers of state property vide order dated 
25.03.2016 holding that:- 
“The petitioners are lessees of the land in question. Their lease 
admittedly expired in 2000 after which they have been in 
unauthorized possession. No case has been made out for any 
protection of their rights as per the notification dated 
18.7.2005 which has been relied upon in this regard. The 
discretion of the learned High Court in terms of Article 199 of 
the Constitution or this Court as per Article 185 of the 
Constitution is not available for the protection of possession of 
people who are usurpers of state property. No case has been 
made out for interference. Dismissed accordingly.”  
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
In another case, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in Civil 
Petition No.882-L of 2015 vide order dated 15.03.2017 held as 
under:- 
“2. We find that in the light of above circumstances, the 
learned High Court rightly allowed the writ petition of the 
respondents and restored possession of the property to them, 
and correctly dismissed the writ petition of the instant 
petitioners, who are admitted encroachers of the property and 
are in unauthorized possession therefore. Resultantly, this 
petition is dismissed.” 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)   
5. 
Moreover, admittedly, land in question is a Charagah land 
and under the law/policy neither its proprietary rights can be 
granted nor it could be sold through private treaty to any person. 
With regard to the Charagah land and its settled objectives of 
utilization, a policy Notification dated 3rd September 1979 
(under Temporary Cultivation Lease Scheme) and Notification 
dated 20th April, 1983 were issued by Colonies Department 
which placed an embargo on the grant of proprietary rights of 
Charagah land and such lands were expressly excluded from any 
grant or grant of proprietary rights under Temporary Cultivation 

 
W.P.No.56073/2020

Lease Scheme. In Clause 2 of the aforementioned notification 
dated 03.09.1979 following lands have been excluded from every 
grant which is as under:- 
2. 
Exceptions and Reservations. Unless it is otherwise 
specifically provided, the following lands shall be deemed 
to have been expressly excluded from every grant under 
these conditions; 
(i) lands already allotted under permanent grants; 
(ii) lands reserved or earmarked but not yet allotted 
under permanent grants; 
(iii) charagahs; 
(iv) lands lying within a belt of:-- 
(a) 
ten miles running along and on the   outer 
side of outer limits of a Corporation; 
(b) 
five miles running along and on the outer 
side of the outer limits of a Municipality; 
(c) 
three miles running along and on the outer 
side of the outer limits of a Town Committee or a 
Mandi Town; 
(v) lands which are/may be reserved for any purpose. 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
Through another Notification No.1925-83/1253-CLI dated 20th 
April, 1983, the Govt. of the Punjab Colonies Department, the 
Charagah Land was excluded from any grant of proprietary 
rights. The relevant clause III of the said notification is as under:- 
Exceptions and Reservations. Unless it is otherwise 
specifically provided, the following categories of State Land 
shall be deemed to have been expressly excluded from every 
grant under these conditions; 
i) 
land already allotted under permanent grants; 
ii) 
lands already reserved or earmarked for permanent 
grants or for a public purpose; 
iii) 
reserved Charagah or Charagah Baqaya in Colony 
chaks;  
iv) 
lands lying within 10 (ten) miles of the outer limits 
of a Municipal Corporation, within 5 (five) miles of the 

 
W.P.No.56073/2020 
 
7
outer limits of a Municipality or with 3 (three) miles of 
the outer limits of a Town Committee/Mandi Town; 
v) 
land lying within 5 (five) miles of the outer limits 
of a Cantonment Board area; 
vi) 
lands allotted or leased out under service grants 
viz, Lambardari grants, House/Mule Breeding tenancy, 
Livestock Breeding tenancy and River Action Scheme.   
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
In the subsequent Notification No.7402-86/374-CLI dated 1st 
February, 1995, issued by the Board of Revenue, Punjab, Lahore, 
a clarification has been furnished regarding the land of prohibited 
Zone previously enunciated under notifications of 1979 and 1983 
for the purpose of grant of proprietary rights. Further, vide 
Notification No.1997-2001/1174-CLI dated 9th July, 2001, the 
following lands have been excluded from every grant:- 
3. Exceptions and Reservations. Unless it is otherwise 
specifically provided the following categories of state land 
shall be deemed to have been expressly excluded from every 
grant to be made under these conditions.    
1. Land already reserved under any other scheme including 
permanent grants/schemes and service grants. 
2. Reserved Charagah or Charagah Baqaya in colony 
Chaks; 
3. Lands lying inside municipal limits and within prohibited 
zone which will be upto 
i). 10 (Ten) miles beyond the outer limits of a 
Metropolitan/Municipal Corporation as existed on 1.1.2001. 
ii). 5 (Five) miles beyond the outer limits of a Municipal 
Committee as existed on 1.1.2001 
iii). 3 (Three) miles beyond the outer limits of a Town 
Committee/Mandi Town as existed on 1.1.2001. 
In the policy notification dated 04.02.1998, the exception from 
grant of proprietary rights of state charagah land remained intact. 
The relevant text whereof is reproduced as under:- 
“i). The Charagah land around the village abadis as also 
alongwith roads shall not be converted into State land and shall 
not be used for any purpose except with the prior permission 
of the Board of Revenue and that for a public purpose only. A 

 
W.P.No.56073/2020 
 
8
recommendation in this behalf should invariably be initiated 
by the District Collector through the Commissioner of the 
relevant division.”  
6.  
Perusal of the afore quoted policy notifications makes it 
abundantly clear that Charagah lands have expressly been 
excluded from any kind of grant or grant of proprietary rights, as 
such its any alienation or grant under Lambardari grant will 
straightway offend policies on the subject. The successive 
policies/notifications on the subject manifestly place  restrictions 
on conversion of the State charagah land into simple state land 
for its onward allotment against any sort of claim, grant of its 
proprietary rights or its any other alternative use. Further change 
of character of the Charagah land was subservient to the 
manifestly described wider scope of public purpose, which is to 
be adjudged objectively by the Board of Revenue. An alike 
controversy has been considered and declined by this Court in its 
judgment cited as Muhammad Israfeel & Others Vs. The 
Province of Punjab & Others (2021 MLD 313). The order passed 
in supra judgment was challenged in Intra Court Appeal 
(No.37127-2020) as well as a subsequent ICA No.85/2021 titled 
Mushtaq Ahmad etc. Vs The Province of Punjab etc. along-with 
other connected ICAs and same also stood dismissed. Further, on 
05.10.2021 another Writ Petition [No.57766/2021] was also 
dismissed on analogy of the aforementioned judgment [2021 
MLD 313] which order of dismissal was assailed before the Apex 
Court who while dismissing Civil Petition No.1925-L/ 2021 on 
25.08.2022 upheld the order of this Court. Thus to that extent the 
issue has attained conclusivety.  
 
In view of above, the petitioners have no locus standi or 
right to claim lease/allotment/purchase of the state Charagah 
land, therefore their claim is rejected.  

 
W.P.No.56073/2020

7. 
As regard the grant of lease of the land in question to 
respondents No.3/Khadim Hussain Lambardar is concerned, 
suffice it to say that respondent No.3 is descendant of Latkan s/o 
Karam who had earlier obtained land under Lumberdari grant and 
then proprietary rights were granted to him on 19.01.1957 and 
mutation was accordingly incorporated on 22.03.1957, thus the 
second time allotment of the State land under lumbardari grant is 
not warranted by law. Reference in this regard is made to Clause 
16(h) of the General Colony Conditions 1938 wherein the word 
“grantee” has been defined as under: 
 “(h) “grantee” includes any person holding under a grant 
whether  as proprietor or as tenant or otherwise, and shall be 
deemed to include the successors and assigns of the grantee 
and when the said term includes co-sharers, any liability 
imposed by these conditions shall be the joint and several 
liability of each co-sharer.” 
Similarly “tenant” has been defined in Section 3 of the 
Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912 as under: 
 “Original Tenant means any male, to whom a tenancy is first 
allotted by the Collector, and includes the male transferee of 
such a tenant and any male nominated by the Collector in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 21 to succeed a 
female, to whom a tenancy was first allotted.” 
The Colonies Department, Government of the Punjab vide 
notification No.3910-76/2686-CV dated 13.07.1976 while 
describing the conditions for disposal of Lambardari grant held 
that the grant of state land shall be subject to the General Colony 
Conditions 1938. For ready reference, relevant portion of the 
aforesaid notification is reproduced as under: 
 “14. The grant of State land shall be subject to the General 
Colony Conditions, 1938 issued under section 10(2) of the 
colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act, 1912, so far 
as they may be applicable thereto.” 
As the predecessor of respondent No.3 had already been granted 
state land under Lambardari Grant as such the respondent No.3 is 
not entitled for any new allotment under the said grant. As per 

 
W.P.No.56073/2020 
 
10
Notification No.315-90/1593-CV dated 29.10.1990, a family 
member cannot obtain more than one lot as Lumberdari Grant as 
such the respondent No.3 is not eligible for grant of land. For 
ready reference, relevant portion of the aforesaid notification is 
reproduced as under: 
“(i) Permanent Lumbardars in Colony Chaks who were not 
given Lambardari grant so far would be eligible to obtain grant 
upto 12-1/2 acres on lease basis as Lambardari gratn without 
any promise of proprietary rights in future. The permanent 
Lambardars in Colony Chaks who themselves or whose 
predecessors-in-interest have already been given Lambardari 
grants would not be given such concessions. Those Lambardar 
including their predecessors-in-interest, who have already 
obtained proprietary rights in respect of their Lambardari grant 
will also be ineligible for the above grant.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
The Colonies Department, Government of Punjab has issued 
notification dated 17.01.2006 regarding statement of conditions 
for grant of state land on lease to the Lambardars wherein in 
Clause 7, the ineligibility criteria has been given as under: 
“7. INELIGIBILITY 
A grantee can have only one lot under these conditions at his 
choice. If at any time it is found that he has got two or more 
tenancies as a “Lambardar” under these conditions or under 
different statement of conditions governing Lambardari grants, 
all of the grants shall be liable to resumption by the District 
Collector, provided that a period of one month shall be 
allowed to the grantee to retain any one of them. The choice 
shall be communicated to the Collector in writing either 
personally or through an authorised agent or by registered post 
(Acknowledgment Due) within thirty days of the receipt of 
intimation to that effect from the Collector.” 
 
As the respondent No.3 does not fulfill the eligibility criteria laid 
down in the notifications dated 29.10.1990 and 17.01.2006, 
reproduced above, as such the order for grant of land to him 
under Lambardari grant is illegal and hereby set aside. 

 
W.P.No.56073/2020 
 
11
8. 
As regard the case of respondent No.4/Ali Sher 
Lambardar is concerned, elaborate findings have been provided 
in earlier part of this judgment that the Charagah land cannot be 
leased out under any grant, thus the claim of above respondent 
for allotment of Cheragah land under lumbardari grant is devoid 
of any force and same is according set at naught.  
9. 
Resultantly, both these writ petitions are disposed of in the 
manner that the order dated 10.09.2020 passed by the Member, 
Board of Revenue in Review Petitions of the respondents No.3 
and 4 is set aside whereas the order dated 07.03.2016 passed by 
the Member, Board of Revenue in Revision Petitions of the 
parties of the lis is hereby upheld.
