Brief Facts 
2. 
 
The petitioner herein namely Muhammad Tariq Khan was 
initially inducted in the National Bank of Pakistan (hereinafter referred to as 
“N.B.P.”) as officer Grade III on 17.03.1996 and later on was promoted as 
officer Grade II vide order dated 03.03.2003. On the other hand, Tahir 
Zaman, who is the petitioner in connected petition was appointed as cashier 
on 20.05.1995 and ultimately was promoted as officer Grade III w.e.f 
01.12.2002. Both the petitioners were when posted at Rawat Branch 
Islamabad as joint custodian/ Manager (Operations) and Cashier 
respectively, an incident of robbery took place which also resulted into the 
assassination of security guard of the Bank. This resulted into registration of 
F.I.R No.28 dated 13.02.2005 under sections 302, 396, 409, 412 & 109 of the

                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as “PPC”) at Police 
Station, Sihala Islamabad against unknown culprits. The petitioners were 
initially suspended from service and subsequently they were also arrayed as 
accused in the criminal case. In addition to criminal proceedings, the 
petitioners were also proceeded departmentally. Shahid Pervaiz Dar, Vice 
President/Manager Cantt. Branch, Rawalpindi was appointed as Inquiry 
Officer, who issued the statement of allegations on 28.04.2005. As per 
averments contained in the petitions, the Inquiry Officer though exonerated 
the petitioners from the allegations but they were informed that competent 
authority being not in agreement with the Inquiry Officer directed the holding 
of fresh inquiry. For the said purpose, an inquiry committee was constituted, 
which issued second statement of allegations to the petitioners. On 
culmination of inquiry, the petitioners were confronted with major penalty of 
dismissal from service vide order dated 22.03.2007. The petitioners were 
since confined in jail, so they routed their departmental appeals from prison. 
In the meanwhile, the petitioners were tried and convicted in the criminal 
case. Being the condemned prisoners, the petitioners challenged their 
conviction in appeal before this Court. The appeals were accepted and the 
petitioners were acquitted from the charges vide judgment dated 08.06.2010. 
The petitioners, after their release, moved fresh representations/appeals but 
on failure to decide, the petitioners approached the Federal Service Tribunal, 
Islamabad. The appeals were, however, dismissed, being not maintainable. 
The petitioners though challenged the judgment of Federal Service Tribunal 
before the Supreme Court of Pakistan but remained unsuccessful as the civil 
petitions were dismissed with the observation that the petitioners could avail 
appropriate remedies before the proper forum. The petitioners then filed their 
respective constitutional petitions before this Court, which were allowed with 
consent by way of a consolidated order dated 09.05.2018 with the 
observation that the Bank shall hold a fresh inquiry. In pursuance to the 
above order, Ghulam Mustafa, Vice President/Regional Executive (Credit), 
Faisalabad was appointed as inquiry officer. On completion of inquiry, the 
petitioners were found guilty and again they were confronted with major 
penalty of dismissal from service vide order dated 21.01.2019. The petitioners 
submitted their representations/appeals before the departmental authority, 
which remained unattended and ultimately the petitioners voiced their

                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
grievance through constitutional petitions before this Court, which were 
disposed of vide order dated 16.02.2021. The representations/ appeals of the 
petitioners were ultimately dismissed by way of order dated 29.06.2021, 
hence these petitions under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as “Constitution”). 
3. 
 
As both these petitions were admitted for regular hearing, so the 
respondents submitted their reply wherein it is canvassed that the petitions 
are not maintainable inter alia; the Court lacks territorial jurisdiction; the 
petitioners have remedy under the Industrial Relations Act, 2012; “N.B.P” 
Rules are non-statutory and petitions are rested on factual controversy. 
4. 
 
Ch. Imran Hassan Ali, Advocate while opening submissions on 
behalf of petitioners contended that departmental proceedings were since 
conducted by the Regional Headquarter Rawalpindi so this Court is vested 
with the territorial jurisdiction and the objection is misconceived. He added 
that the petitioners are not workmen so they don’t have any remedy under the 
Industrial Relations Act, 2012. It is argued with vehemence that rules 
governing the employment of “N.B.P” employees are statutory and this Court 
can invoke the constitutional jurisdiction. Learned counsel submitted that 
glaring irregularities were committed during the departmental inquiry. It is 
contended that the findings of inquiry officer are self-contradictory. Learned 
counsel further contended that main charges against the petitioners were 
though never proved but they have been held guilty in an illegal and unlawful 
manner. In order to supplement his contentions, learned counsel placed 
reliance on The FEDERAL GOVERNMENT through Secretary Interior, 
Government of Pakistan v. Ms. AYYAN ALI and others (2017 SCMR 1179), 
NATIONAL BANK OF PAKISTAN and another v. ANWAR SHAH and others 
(2015 SCMR 434), MUHAMMAD NAEEM v. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN 
and others (2023 SCMR 301), FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through 
Chairman Federal Board of Revenue FBR House, Islamabad and others v. 
ZAHID MALIK (2023 SCMR 603) and LPG ASSOCIATION OF PAKISTAN 
through Chairman v. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary, 
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources, Islamabad and 8 others (2009 
CLD 1498).

5. 
 
Adding to the contentions of his counterpart Mr. Muhammad 
Arshad Tabraiz, Advocate submitted that the petitioners have been found 
guilty by the inquiry officer on the basis of surmises and conjectures. It is 
contended that major penalty has been imposed upon the petitioners in a 
mechanical manner without adhering the principles of natural justice.  
6. 
 
Conversely, Malik Muhammad Siddique Awan, Advocate for the 
respondents, while reiterating the preliminary objections raised in the reply 
submitted that criminal case was since registered at police station within the 
territorial limits of Islamabad, so this Court lacks territorial jurisdiction. He 
also laid much emphasis on the ground that matter in issue entails factual 
inquiry and this Court cannot substitute the findings of inquiry officer or the 
appellate authority in writ jurisdiction.

Heard. Record perused. 
8. 
 
Before embarking upon the rigmarole of the factual aspects of 
the matter, it would be apposite to first attend the objections with regard to 
maintainability of these petitions. First comes the question of territorial 
jurisdiction of this Court. As observed earlier that the petitioners are the 
employees of “N.B.P”. In their respective capacities, as officers Grade II and 
III, they were posted at “N.B.P” Branch Rawat, Islamabad. During their 
posting, unfortunately an incident of robbery took place in the bank which 
resulted into registration of a criminal case against unknown accused but 
later on the petitioners were arrayed as perpetrators of offence. The 
petitioners were tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Islamabad 
and ultimately, they were convicted vide judgment dated 15.06.2007. Feeling 
dissatisfied, the petitioners challenged their conviction through criminal 
appeals No.180 and 178/2007 before this Court which were allowed by way 
of judgment dated 08.06.2010 and the petitioners were resultantly acquitted. 
Simultaneously, the petitioners were also proceeded departmentally. In the 
first departmental inquiry, the petitioners were absolved from the charges by 
the inquiry officer. The petitioners were, however, informed through letter 
dated 27.08.2005 that competent authority while disagreeing with the inquiry 
officer decided to hold a denovo inquiry. In furtherance whereof, an inquiry 
committee comprising of Mr. Pervaiz Taj Bhatti, Vice President and Mr.

                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
Shahzado Khan Pathan, Vice President was constituted which issued fresh 
statement of allegations on 03.12.2005. It is evident that second show cause 
notice was issued to the petitioners by the committee through Regional Office, 
Bank Road, Saddar, Rawalpindi. It is an undeniable fact that all the 
proceedings pursuant thereto were conducted at Regional Office, Rawalpindi. 
Even in the previous round, the petitioners filed W.P.No.2443/2011 and 
W.P.No.2539/2011, which were allowed vide order dated 09.05.2018 in the 
following manner: - 
“6. 
In 
view 
of 
above, 
this 
petition, 
as 
well 
as 
W.P.No.2443/2011, is allowed, the inquiry and the order dated 
22.03.2007, passed by respondent-bank is set aside and the respondent-
bank, as submitted by learned counsel of the respondent-bank, shall 
hold a fresh inquiry to provide a fair right of hearing to the petitioner. 
This exercise, as suggested by learned counsel for the respondent-
bank, shall be completed within three months. The petitioner shall 
appear in the Regional Office of respondent-bank on 01.06.2018 and 
no notice to procure his attendance will be issued by the respondent-
bank.” 
It would not be out of context to mention here that after the culmination of 
denovo inquiry, the matter again came up before this Court through 
W.P.No.1712/2019, which was disposed of vide order dated 16.02.2021. In 
the wake of above discussion, it can thus safely be held that this Court is 
vested with the territorial jurisdiction to entertain these petitions. While 
forming my view I am fortified with the principles laid down in The 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT through Secretary Interior, Government of 
Pakistan v. Ms. AYYAN ALI and others (2017 SCMR 1179). The relevant 
extract is reproduced below: - 
4.         As regards the question of territorial jurisdiction, it hardly need 
any emphasis that the impugned Notification/Memorandum has been 
issued by the Federal Government, which functions all over the country, 
and since the respondent No.1 resides in Karachi, and has a right and 
choice to proceed abroad through Jinnah International Airport, Karachi, 
and in fact atleast twice earlier she had proceeded to go abroad through 
Jinnah International Airport, Karachi, though she was stopped owing to 
the earlier Notifications/Memorandums, and therefore the embargo 
placed on her leaving the country has in fact taken place at Karachi, 
which prevention in all likelihood, was to be repeated at Karachi in 
pursuance of the third Notification/Memorandum, and thus giving rise to 
a cause of action against the third Notification/Memorandum at Karachi 
because of its taking effect there. It is now well settled that the Federal 
Government, though may have exclusive residence or location at 
Islamabad, would still be deemed to function all over the country. In this 
regard the case of LPG Association of Pakistan through its Chairman v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Petroleum and 

6 
                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
Natural Resources Islamabad and 8 others (2009 CLD 1498), may be 
referred to, whereby the Lahore High Court, after meticulously 
analyzing the judgments rendered by this Court, as well as of the High 
Courts on the question of territorial jurisdiction, with regard to the acts, 
deeds and the legislative instruments of/by the Federal Government, has 
deduced the jurisprudential principles as follows:- 
"(A)      The Federal Government or any body politic or a 
corporation or a statutory authority having exclusive 
residence or location at Islamabad with no office at any 
other place in any of the Province, shall still be deemed to 
function all over the country. 
(B)       If such Government, body or authority passes any order 
or initiates an action at Islamabad, but it affects the 
"aggrieved party" at the place other than the Federal 
capital, such party shall have a cause of action to agitate 
about his grievance within the territorial jurisdiction of 
the High Court in which said order/action has affected 
him. 
(C)       This shall be moreso in the cases where a party is 
aggrieved by a legislative instrument (including any 
rules, etc.) on the ground of it being ultra vires, because 
the cause to sue against that law shall accrue to a person 
at the place where his rights have been affected. For 
example, if a law is challenged on the ground that it is 
confiscatory in nature, violative of the fundamental rights 
to property; profession; association etc. and any curb has 
been placed upon such a right by a law enforced at 
Islamabad, besides there, it can also be challenged within 
the jurisdiction of the High Court, where the right is 
likely to be affected. 
In this context, illustrations can be given, that if some 
duty/tax has been imposed upon the withdrawal of the 
amounts by the account holders from their bank account 
and the aggrieved party is, maintaining the account at 
Lahore though the Act/law has been passed at Islamabad, 
yet his right being affected where he maintained the 
account (Lahore), he also can competently initiate a writ 
petition in Lahore besides Islamabad; this shall also be 
true for the violation of any right to profession, if being 
conducted by a person at Lahore, obviously in the 
situation, he shall have a right to seek the enforcement of 
his right in any of the two High Courts." 
And thus whether or not the subject Notification/Memorandum was 
issued on the recommendation of the Punjab Government has no 
relevance to the question of the Court's jurisdiction in the matter. 
Furthermore it is also factually incorrect to claim that the Notification/ 
Memorandum has been issued in pursuance of an order passed by the 
learned Lahore High Court as the learned High Court's order dated 
17.5.2016, being referred to in this regard, contain only a direction to the 
petitioner to decide a certain application submitted by the petitioner 
before it, in accordance with law. Absolutely no direction or order was 
passed by the learned Lahore High Court for issuance of any 
Notification/Memorandum. Even otherwise such order of the learned 
High Court cannot be successfully used to plead lack of jurisdiction of 

7 
                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
the learned High Court of Sindh in the matter, because brought under 
challenge before the High Court of Sindh was the Notification/ 
Memorandum issued by the petitioner and not any act or deed of the 
Government of Punjab. Furthermore as noted hereinbefore, the earlier 
two Notifications/Memorandums have been successfully challenged 
before the learned High Court of Sindh as the said Court in view of the 
above principle, has entertained those petitions.” 
9. 
 
In the case of LPG ASSOCIATION OF PAKISTAN through 
Chairman v. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary, Ministry of 
Petroleum and Natural Resources, Islamabad and 8 others (2009 CLD 1498), 
a learned Single Bench of this Court held as under: - 
6. From the judgments cited at the Bar on both the sides, the portions 
whereof have been extensively reproduced, the following ratio is 
deducible:-- 
  
(A) The Federal Government or any body politic or a corporation 
or a statutory authority having exclusive residence or location 
at Islamabad with no office at any other place in, any of the 
Provinces, shall still be deemed to function all over the 
country. 
  
(B) If such Government, body or authority passes any order or 
initiates an action at Islamabad, but it affects the "aggrieved 
party" at the place other than the Federal capital, such party 
shall have a cause of action to agitate about his grievance 
within the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court in which 
said order/action has affected him. 
  
(C) This shall be moreso in the cases where a party is aggrieved 
or a legislative instrument (including any rules, etc.) on the 
ground of it being ultra vires, because the cause to sue 
against that law shall accrue to a person at the place where 
his rights have been affected. For example, if a law is 
challenged on the ground that it is confiscatory in nature, 
violative of the fundamental rights to property; profession, 
association etc. and any curb has been placed upon such a 
right by a law enforced at Islamabad, besides there, it can 
also be challenged within the jurisdiction of the High Court, 
where the right is likely to be affected. 
  
In this context, illustrations can be given, that if some 
duty/tax has been imposed upon the withdrawal of the 
amounts by the account holders from their bank account and 
the aggrieved party is maintaining the account at Lahore, 
though the Act/law has been passed at Islamabad, yet his 
right' being affected where he maintains the account 
(Lahore), he also can competently initiate a writ petition in 
Lahore besides Islamabad; this shall also be true for the 
violation of any right to profession, if being conducted by a 
person at Lahore, obviously in the situation, he shall have a 
right to seek the enforcement of his right in any of the two 
'High Courts. 
 
(D) On account of the above, both the Islamabad and Lahore 
High Courts shall have the concurrent jurisdiction in certain 

8 
                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
matters and it shall not be legally sound or valid to hold that 
as the Federal Government etc. resides in Islamabad, and 
operates from there; the assailed order/action has also 
emanated from Islamabad, therefore, it is only the Capital 
High Court which shall possess the jurisdiction. The 
dominant purpose in such a situation shall be irrelevant, 
rather on account of the rule of choice, the plaintiff/petitioner 
shall have the right to choose the forum of his convenience. 
10. 
 
So far status of rules of “N.B.P” governing its employees is 
concerned, it is observed that “N.B.P” was established and incorporated 
under the National Bank of Pakistan (Ordinance No.XIX of 1949) as a body 
corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal, and shall by the 
said name sue and be sued. In order to regulate the services of the “N.B.P” 
employees, the National Bank of Pakistan Staff Service Rules, 1973 
(hereinafter referred to as “Rules, 1973”) were made. The above rules 
followed the National Bank of Pakistan (Staff) Service, Rules, 1980 
(hereinafter referred to as “Rules, 1980”), which were given effect from 1st 
January, 1980. It would be imperative to mention here that “Rules, 1973” 
were not repealed by the later rules and as such same remained alive for all 
intent and purposes.  
11. 
 
In the case of MUHAMMAD TARIQ BADR and another v. 
NATIONAL BANK OF PAKISTAN and others (2013 SCMR 314), the 
question with regard to the nature of the “Rules, 1980” and their effect on the 
“Rules, 1973” came under discussion before the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
and it was held as under: - 
9.         Be that as it may, dilating upon the first proposition set out 
above, suffice it to say that according to the provisions of section 20 of 
the Act, 1974 the rule making power is conferred upon the Federal 
Government in the terms as under:-- 
  
            "Power to make Rules. The Federal Government may, by 
notification in the official Gazette, make Rules to provide for all 
matters for which provision is necessary or expedient for the 
purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Act." 
  
            It is an admitted position that 1980 Rules have not been framed 
as per the mandate of law ibid, inasmuch as these rules are neither made 
by the Federal Government nor published in the, official gazette. There 
is also no cavil/quibble that the said rules have not been 
composed/enforced with the prior approval of the Government or any 
subsequent benediction was conferred to those by the Government. 
Rather (admittedly) the rules have been formulated by the Board of the 
respondent-bank constituted under section 11 of the Act, 1974 which 
stipulate the general power of the Board pertaining to policy making and 
the administration and management of the nationalized banks. 

9 
                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
Subsection (4) thereof specifically provides "The general direction and 
superintendence of the affairs and business of a bank, and overall policy 
making in respect of its operations, shall vest in its Board". 
Furthermore, as per subsection (5) of the Act, 1974 the Board shall 
determine "personal policies of the bank, including appointment and 
removal of officers and employees" and in accordance with subsection 
(10) "All selections, promotion and transfer of employees of banks 
except the President and decisions as to their remuneration and benefits 
shall be made by the President in accordance with the evaluation 
criteria and personnel polices determined by the Board". From the 
above it is unequivocally clear that the 1980 Rules have been framed by 
the Board of the bank pursuant to its authority in the nature of 
management/ superintendence of the affairs of the bank and/or the 
policy making power; however for all intents and purposes, it is so done 
in the exercise of an executive authority under the statute, but having 
even no remote or possible or permissible connection and nexus to any 
statutory jurisdiction, these rules thus can at best be termed, understood, 
comprehended and construed merely as the guidelines or the domestic 
instructions of the N.B.P., for the purposes of highlighting, elucidating 
or beneficially revamping the service structure of bank's employees for 
their advantage, provided the same do not in any manner contravene the 
1973 Rules, but nothing more than that can be imputed to those; and in 
any case the rules do not enjoy the status of a statutory instrument. And 
this is not disputed by the parties, therefore, the legal question which 
eminently calls for the resolution, is that whether non-statutory rules 
(though we have herein construed these as mere instruction etc.) have, 
and/or can repeal, rescind or displace the statutory rules of 1973? To 
plead so, it has been inter alia submitted on the bank's behalf that on 
account of section 13(2) of the Act, 1974 particularly the expression 
"Notwithstanding" which shall operate as a non obstante provision/ 
clause,  even  though  1980  Rules  are  non-statutory, yet as per the 
force of the law afore-stated, these (1980 Rules) have the overriding 
effect qua the 1973 Rules. In order to appreciate the above contention, it 
shall be germane to reproduce the whole section 13 which reads as 
follows: --  
  
"13. Provisions regarding staff. (1) Save as otherwise provided 
in this Act, all officers and other employees of a bank shall 
continue in their respective offices and employment on the same 
terms and conditions, remuneration and rights as to pension and 
gratuity, as were applicable to them immediately before the 
commencing day. 
  
(2)        Notwithstanding any law or any provision contained in a 
contract agreement, letter of appointment, rules or regulations of 
a bank, every officer and employee of a bank shall be liable to 
transfer to any of its branches in or outside Pakistan or to any 
other bank. 
  
Provided that his status and emoluments shall not be adversely 
affected." 
  
            A plain reading of section 13(1) ibid unambiguously postulates 
that the service of the officers and other employees of the nationalized 
banks have in fact and in true sense and spirit been secured and 
protected (emphasis supplied) as per force thereof "on the same terms 
and conditions" etc. which were applicable to them immediately before 
the commencement of the Act, 1974. It is an admitted and undisputed 
factual reality that before the commencing day of 1974 Act, 1973 Rules 

10 
                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
were validly in force and for all intents and purposes were serving as the 
conclusive terms and conditions of service of the employment for the 
N.B.P. officers etc. Thus, by virtue of the section 13(1), such rules were 
specifically saved, guarded and shielded instead of having been 
displaced/repealed/rescinded overridden. The language of the section 
13(1) without any shadow of doubt, spells out the clear intendment of 
the legislature to preserve the earlier terms and conditions of the 
nationalized bank, which in the present case undoubtedly were 1973 
Rules, rather than being obliterated. The argument of the learned counsel 
for the respondent that the expression "notwithstanding" appearing in 
section 13(2) should be construed as a non obstante provision/clause to 
annul and cancel 1973 Rules 'as a whole' and thus be replaced by 1980 
Rules is doubtlessly misconceived and unfounded. The protection and 
security provided under section 13(1) which in fact is absolute and 
unambiguous in nature cannot be negated and vitiated by section 13(2) 
on account of the expression “notwithstanding’ which is an expression 
only relatable to that specific part and purpose of the section (i.e. 13(2)). 
In my candid view it can neither be legally done, or permissible under 
the law nor it is the purport or the meaning and the spirit of section 13(2) 
when it is read in the syntax of its full text. In simplest terms, the tenor 
and the command of this subsection is limited and restricted qua the 
transfer of the officers/employees of a nationalized bank, inter se the 
branches of the same bank, and/or a room has been provided for such 
transfer to any other nationalized bank. Obviously this being the 
legislative command and if there was anything to the contrary contained 
in any other law for the time being in force i.e. any law in force at the 
time of enforcement of 1974 Act, including the 1973 Rules to this 
restricted extent, the provisions of subsection (2) of section 13 shall 
prevail and anything inconsistent thereto even in the said (1973) Rules 
or contract/agreement etc. shall be subservient to this provision and has 
to give way. But this shall be without in any manner affecting any other 
earlier terms and conditions of service, which stand fully secured under 
section 13(1). I may like to add here with emphasis that the Board of 
N.B.P. constituted under section 11 of the Act, 1974, at the most was 
conferred with the power of managing the affairs of the bank in terms of 
the policies etc. to be formulated by it on the subjects enumerated in the 
section, but by no express command of law (section 11) was empowered 
to make service rules, which can be termed as statutory in nature, with 
the further authority to annul the statutory rules already in force. In any 
case, the Board in the garb of its general empowerment of policy 
making, superintendence and managing the affairs and business of the 
bank, by no stretch of legal comprehension and principle of 
interpretation could, rescind, replace, substitute and/or vitiate the 1973 
Rules. This undoubtedly could not be done by a non-statutory 
instrument, which has come into being through simipliciter account of 
the exercise of executive authority of the Board; and it is a fundamental 
rule of jurisprudence that the executive has no empowerment to annul or 
in any manner invalidate or vitiate the command of the statute. 
Therefore, I am constrained to hold that 1980 Rules have not replaced or 
rescinded the earlier rules of 1973.” 
After going through the principles laid down in the case of MUHAMMAD 
TARIQ BADR supra, there remains no hint of doubt with regard to the nature 
of “Rules, 1973” being statutory. It is also added with clarity that the 
petitioners were also governed by the said Rules.

Adverting to the contention of learned counsel for the 
respondent Bank that with the framing of the National Bank  of Pakistan Staff 
Service Rules, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as “Rules, 2021”), the petitioners 
are to be governed under the said Rules as by virtue of Rule 72 of “Rules, 
2021”, “Rules, 1973” have been repealed, suffice to observe that the 
appropriate answer to this proposition is embodied in section 6 of the 
General Clauses Act, 1897, which reads as under: - 
6. Effect of repeal. – Where this Act, or any (Central Act) or 
Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, repeals 
any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to be made, then, 
unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not-  
(a) 
revive anything not in force or existing at the time at 
which the repeal takes effect; or  
(b) 
affect the previous operation of any enactment so 
repealed or anything duly done or suffered thereunder; or  
(c) 
affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, 
accrued or incurred under any enactment so repealed; or  
(d) 
affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in 
respect of any offence committed against any enactment so 
repealed; or  
(e) 
affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in 
respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, 
forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid; 
and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be 
instituted, continued or enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture 
or punishment may be imposed as if the repealing Act or 
Regulation had not been passed. 
From the bare reading of the above referred provision of law, it clearly 
manifests that a change in the substantive law amounting to divest and 
adversely affect the vested rights of the parties shall always have prospective 
implication unless by express intention of the legislature such law has been 
made applicable retrospectively. The petitioners, for all intent and purposes, 
are the employees of “N.B.P” and are governed by the “Rules, 1973” being 
statutory in nature. “N.B.P” being a statutory corporation is amenable to the 
writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the “Constitution”. 
Guidance to the above effect can be sought from MUHAMMAD NAEEM v. 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others (2023 SCMR 301). The relevant 
extract from the same is reproduced below: - 

12 
                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
“6.    We are cognizant of the legal position that the NBP, 
being a statutory corporation, is amenable to the writ jurisdiction of 
the High Courts under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, and its employees when are governed or 
proceeded against under the statutory rules can also avail the recourse 
to the writ jurisdiction for the redressal of their grievances in respect 
of their service matters. However, this legal position does not merge 
the NBP, a separate juristic person, into the Federal Government, nor 
in any manner blur the distinction between NBP a Statutory 
Corporation and the Federal Government, a constitutional body or in 
any manner turn the employees of the NBP into the employees of the 
Federal Government.” 
13. 
 
One of the objections with regard to maintainability of the 
petitions is that the petitioners have an alternate remedy under the Industrial 
Relations Act, 2012 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 2012”), suffice to 
observe that “Act, 2012” was promulgated to consolidate and rationalize the 
law relating to formation of trade unions, and improvement of relations 
between employers and workmen in the Islamabad Capital Territory and in 
trans-provincial establishments and industry. Worker and Workmen are 
defined in subsection (xxxiii) of section 2 of the “Act, 2012”, which reads as 
under: - 
2 (xxxiii) 
“worker and “workman” mean person not falling within 
the definition of employer who is employed (including employment as a 
supervisor or as an apprentice) in an establishment or industry for hire or 
reward either directly or through a contractor whether the terms of 
employment are express or implied, and, for the purpose of any 
proceedings under this Act in relation to an industrial dispute includes a 
person who has been dismissed, discharged, retrenched, laid off or 
otherwise removed from employment in connection with or as a 
consequence 
of 
that 
dispute 
or 
whose 
dismissal, 
discharge, 
retrenchment, lay-off, or removal has led to that dispute but does not 
include any person who is employed mainly in managerial or 
administrative capacity.” 
The petitioners being the officers of the “N.B.P”, in no way, can be equated 
or termed as workmen. While forming my opinion, I am fortified with the 
judgment in the case of NATIONAL BANK OF PAKISTAN and another v. 
ANWAR SHAH and others (2015 SCMR 434). The relevant extract from the 
same is reproduced below:  
8…… The 'worker' and the 'workman' defined in the Act mean 
person not falling within the definition of 'employer' who is employed as 
a supervisor or as an apprentice but does not include a person who is 
employed mainly in managerial or administrative capacity. On the other 
hand, the 'employer' as defined in the Act includes a person who is 
proprietor, director, manager, secretary, agent or officer or person 
concerned with the management of the affairs of the establishment. The 
term 'officer' is specifically mentioned in the definition of term 

13 
                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
'employer'. However, as has been noted from the case-law cited by the 
learned counsel for the parties, the Courts have not considered the 
designation of a person to be a factor determining his status of 
employment in an establishment to be that of an officer or a workman 
rather the Court has always considered the nature of duties and functions 
of a person to be the factor which will determine his status as to whether 
he is a workman or not. In this respect, we may refer to the case of 
National Bank of Pakistan v. Punjab Labour Court No.5, Faisalabad 
(1993 SCMR 672), which was a case relating to an Officer Grade-I1 of 
NBP against whom disciplinary action was taken. He approached the 
Labour Court for redressal of his grievance claiming himself to be a 
workman. The matter came up to this Court and it was held that the 
designation per se is not determinative of a person being a workman 
rather the nature of duties and function determine his status and the 
burden is on him to establish that he is a workman. As the Officer 
Grade-II failed to discharge his burden, he was held not to be a 
'workman' and his grievance petition was dismissed. The ratio of this 
case and also of the other cases that have been relied upon by the learned 
counsel for the parties is that the person who approaches a Labour Court 
for redressal of his grievance claiming himself to be a workman and 
such status of workman being denied by the employer, it becomes a 
bounden duty of a person who approaches the Labour forum to 
demonstrate through evidence that his nature of duties and functions 
were that of a workman and not that of a managerial or administrative 
capacity and that he was not an employer. Unless such categoric 
evidence is led by him, he will not be considered to be a workman and 
his grievance petition will not be maintainable before the Labour forum. 
It, therefore, implies that the officer cannot be assumed to be workmen 
nor such can be declared on mere asking. The argument that officers 
Grade-I to III are performing supervisory function in itself means that 
this has to be established by evidence. In this view of the matter, on a 
solitary claim of the union no blanket declaration can be given that the 
Officers Grade-I to III in the establishment of NBP are workmen. 
  
9. We may also here make reference to the case of Karachi Pipe 
Mills Employees Union v. Karachi Pipe Mills Ltd. Karachi (1992 SCMR 
36), where union has filed an application under section 34 of erstwhile 
Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1969, claiming payment of benefit of 
overtime to the workers employed in the Mills. This Court, after 
elaborate discussion, came to the conclusion that CBA in an application 
under section 34 of the Ordinance can only raise grievance before a 
Labour Court for enforcement of its own rights guaranteed under the 
law, award and settlement and not the rights of an individual worker 
who has remedy under section 25A of Ordinance to raise his own 
grievance in respect of right guaranteed to him under any law, award or 
settlement. Sections 60 and 33 of the Act are in similar term as that of 
sections 34 and 25-A of the Ordinance. Thus, for this reason also NBP 
Employees Front was not competent in taking up the cause of Officers 
Grade-I to III of having them declared as 'workmen'.”  
Reference to this effect can also be made to HABIB BANK LIMITED v. 
GULZAR KHAN and others (2019 SCMR 946). 
14. 
 
Now coming to the propriety of departmental proceedings, 
resulting into dismissal of the petitioners from service, it is observed without 
any hint of doubt that there is no legal impediment in conducting criminal 

14 
                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
and departmental/disciplinary proceedings side by side. It is also trite that 
even in case of acquittal in criminal proceedings, employee cannot claim 
immunity being proceeded departmentally. The fate of departmental 
proceedings is always to be adjudged from the incriminating material placed 
in support of the charges against the delinquent employee. At the same time, 
one cannot keep himself aloof from the fact that if an employee is precluded 
to claim the premium of his acquittal in the departmental proceedings, he 
cannot be vexed merely on account of his conviction in the criminal case. 
15. 
 
In order to examine the validity of the departmental 
proceedings, it is noticed that initially the petitioners were suspended and 
they were confronted with statement of allegations and charges on 28th April, 
2005 in pursuance whereof, an inquiry was conducted by Shahid Pervaiz 
Dar, Vice President/Inquiry Executive, who exonerated the petitioners from 
the charges, which followed the second inquiry conducted by two members 
committee while serving the petitioners with the fresh statement of allegations 
and charges on 3rd December, 2005. The inquiry committee held the 
petitioners guilty of the charges and resultantly by way of order dated 22nd 
March, 2007, major penalty of dismissal from service was imposed upon 
them. The petitioners were since confined in jail, so they moved a 
departmental appeal therefrom and later on both the petitioners were 
convicted in the criminal trial against which they preferred their appeals 
before this Court, which were allowed. On their release from jail, the 
petitioners moved fresh departmental appeals and since they received no 
response 
from 
the 
respondents, 
so 
they 
filed 
service 
appeals 
No.1358(R)CS/2010 and 1448(R)CS/2010 before the Federal Service 
Tribunal. The appeals were, however, dismissed by the Tribunal by way of 
judgment dated 18th June, 2011, being not maintainable. Feeling dissatisfied, 
the petitioners then filed Civil Petitions for leave to appeal before the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan, which too were dismissed with the observation 
that the petitioners could avail the appropriate remedy before the proper 
forum. The petitioners then filed W.Ps.No.2443 and 2539 of 2011 respectively 
before this Court. The petitions were allowed vide order dated 9th May, 2018 
in the manner as  narrated hereinabove. In pursuance of the order of this 
Court, denovo inquiry was conducted by Mr. Ghulam Mustafa, Vice 

15 
                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
President/ Regional Executive  (Credit), Faisalabad, who on finalizing the 
inquiry recommended the imposition of major penalty, which was accordingly 
imposed by way of order dated 21st January, 2019. 
16. 
 
The petitioners being dissatisfied again moved departmental 
appeal before the President “N.B.P” as well as Executive Officer 
President/Group Head through proper channel, so as to be placed before the 
competent appellate authority but remain unattended. This prompted the 
petitioners to file W.P.Nos.1712 of 2019 and W.P.No.936 of 2019, which 
were disposed of vide common order dated 16th February, 2021 in the 
following manner: - 
“This constitutional petition as well as connected petition 
W.P.No.936 of 2019 challenges the dismissal of the petitioners by the 
competent authority of National Bank of Pakistan (NBP). During the 
course of arguments, it was admitted by the learned counsel for the 
petitioners that an appeal under rule 40 of the NBP Staff Service 
Rules, 1973 has been filed to the competent authority which has not 
been decided. Therefore, quite clearly since the petitioners have 
availed the remedies provided under law, they cannot be permitted to 
make collateral challenge to the same order. These petitions are 
therefore disposed of with a direction to the respondent No.2 
Regional Chief Executive, Rawalpindi Cantt to ensure that the 
appeals of the petitioners are placed before the competent authority 
empowered under the rules to decide these appeals. These appeals 
then shall be decided within the next two months of the receipt of the 
order of this Court by the competent authority before whom the 
appeals shall be placed for decision.” 
Leaving aside the desultory events occurring thereafter, ultimately by way of 
order dated 29th June, 2021, the departmental appeal was declined.  
17. 
 
As already observed that in the first inquiry report, the 
petitioners were absolved from the allegations whereas in the second inquiry 
though the petitioners were held guilty but it was scratched by this Court 
through judgment dated 9th May, 2018 directing the respondent Bank to hold 
de novo proceedings. In the final inquiry resulting into dismissal of the 
petitioners, it is noticed that the petitioners were confronted with charges 
founded on the following statements of allegations: - 
STATEMENT OF ALLEGATIONS AGAINST 
MUHAMMAD TARIQ KHAN. 
“As per the order to the General Manager (Maintenance) being the 
Competent Authority under section 2(a) read with sections 3 and 5 of 
the Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance 2000, the

                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
undersigned has been appointed as the Inquiry Executive to inquire 
into the following allegations and charges levelled against you. 
1. 
Being Passing Officer/Joint custodian, he under criminal 
intentions, passed on 12.02.2005 a bogus late cash receipt 
voucher of Rs.5,700,000/- in respect of CA No.870-8 and 
authenticated late cash receipt in Branch Cash Balance Book (B-
52) and joined hands for accomplishment of planned murderous 
robbery and caused financial loss to the Bank. 
 
2. 
On 12.02.2005, total cash balance after close of day’s 
transaction 
including 
Prize 
Bonds 
was 
aggregating 
Rs.1,425,273.66 and he in connivance with Mr. Tahir Zaman 
(U/S) OG-III/Cash Officer, after showing bogus receipt of 
Rs.5,700,000/- misappropriated Branch Cash Balance valuables 
worth Rs.3,862,530/- leaving an amount of Rs.562,743.66 in 
large safe and left the branch. 
 
3. 
He, contrary to the instructions contained in SPM, Volume-I, 
Para-9/B in respect of “Discipline and General conduct” Rule, 
owed Rs.1.200 (M), from Mr. Tahir Zaman, OG-III/Cash Officer 
evidencing joint malpractices thereof and started foul play of 
parallel/pocketing banking. 
 
4. 
He, contrary to the instructions contained in SPM, Volume-I, 
Para-66/B, 226 & 227 also handed over his small safe keys to his 
counterpart, Mr. Tahir Zaman, OG-III/Cash Officer at mid night 
on 12.02.2005. Therefore, he has not only been found guilty as 
co-associate providing free hand for accomplishment of the 
heinous crime/ murderous robbery but also created bad name for 
the prestigious institution. 
 
STATEMENT OF ALLEGATIONS AGAINST 
TAHIR ZAMAN. 
1. 
Being OG-III/Cash Officer, you joined hands with your 
counterpart joint custodian at Rawat Branch and involved 
yourself in criminal and fraudulent malpractices and also started 
foul play of parallel pocketing banking. 
 
2. 
In connivance with Mr. Muhammad Tariq Khan, OG-II (U/S) 
prepared a bogus late receipt voucher of Rs.5,700,000/- duly 
entered in Cash Balance Book on 12-02-2005 under your 
signature and planned to dramatize a pre-planned dacoity that 
resulted not only cruel slaughtering of the innocent security 
guard on duty but also financial loss to Bank. 
 
3. 
During your posting as Incharge Cashier, you had not only been 
found guilty as main character in heinous crime of murderous 
robbery during 12/13-02-2005 (night) at Rawat Branch, but also 
created bad name for the prestigious institution. 
 
4. 
You for satisfaction of the A/C holder Mr. Masood Pervaiz C/A 
No.870-8 made an unauthorized payment of Rs.700,000/- from 
Branch cash balance on 12-02-2005 through Mr. Ali Ashgar, 
Security Guard. 
 

17 
                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
5. 
You contrary to Bank instructions issued from time to time for 
strengthening safety and security, allowed your co-associates, 
criminal professional (outsider) M/s Azam Khan, Blund Khan & 
Taj Khan to enter the branch premises after 1800 hours on 12-
02-2005 and left the branch alongwith Mr. Asif Masih, Sweeper 
resulting murderous dacoity. 
In the process of inquiry, the petitioners were though associated and process 
was completed on 16th July, 2018 but it appears from the inquiry report that 
later on the complainant sent further documents in support of the charges 
through courier under cover of his letter dated 13th September, 2018, which 
as per Inquiry Officer were routed to the petitioners so as to give a fair 
chance of defence for their response/reply with regard to the 
documents/evidence. The inquiry report was thus revised after taking into 
consideration the documents submitted by the complainant and the response 
received from the petitioners in terms thereof. It is an admitted position on 
the record that the petitioner Muhammad Tariq Khan was absolved from rest 
of the charges except charge No.1, which too was proved partly to the extent 
of passing bogus late receipt of Rs.5,700,000/- in respect of c/a 870-8 and 
authenticated late cash receipt in Branch Cash Balance Book (B-52). From 
the bare reading of nature of the charges, it is manifestly clear that charges 
No.1 and 2 are clearly interlinked and dependent to each other. Charge No.2 
was directly relatable to bogus receipts. It is quite strange that on the one 
hand it is opined by the Inquiry Officer that Charge No.2 was not proved but 
on the contrary, the petitioner in W.P.No.2832 of 2021 was held guilty of 
charge No.1 partly to the extent of passing bogus late receipts. The findings 
of guilt with regard to Charge No.1 are not tenable as per Inquiry Officer’s 
own comments, which are reproduced below for the purpose of convenience:- 
1. 
Copy of Debit Voucher dated 14.02.2005 regarding debit 
of Rs.9,562,530.00 to Branch Protested Bill Account 
bearing signatures of Mr Muhammad Tariq Khan  along 
with signatures of the then Branch Manager, provided by 
the complainant, shows that dacoity was taken place in 
branch and the amount of Cash/Valuables found short 
was debited to Protested Bill. The accused accepted his 
signatures on the voucher. However from the said 
voucher, it cannot be ascertained that who dacoit was. 
Moreover the amount of debit voucher shows that amount 
of Late Receipt of Rs.5.700M is included in the amount 
debited to protest bill. However the copy of above 
voucher itself does not indicate that late receipt was 
bogus or otherwise. 
2. 
From the Copy of relevant page of Cash Balance Book B 
52 showing late receipt of Rs.5,700,000/- bearing 

18 
                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
signatures of the accused, then Branch Manager and Mr 
Tahir Zaman, it appears that there was late Receipt of 
Rs.5,700,000/- regarding account NO.870-8 Masood 
Pervez. Said Page of B 52 does not reflect any thing to 
ascertain that late receipt was bogus or otherwise. 
3. 
Copy of statement of account of Mr Muhammad Tariq 
Khan does not show any entry which may create link 
with late receipt of Rs.5,700,000/-. 
4. 
The Witness, Mr Mehmood Abbasi, stated that signature 
on B 52 were put by him confirming the signatures of 
joint custodian of branch and Head cashier of Branch as 
per practice of Bank. He endorsed his already submitted 
statement dated 15.02.2005 in which he has said nothing 
about late receipt. 
5. 
The accused has stated that the alleged late receipt for 
Rs.5,700,000/- was regularly been received from the 
depositor by the Cash Officer, entered it in the cash 
receipt book as well as in the Branch Cash Balance Book 
(B-52). 
18. 
 
The nature of charges against the petitioner namely Tahir 
Zaman was almost the same. The Inquiry Officer though absolved him from 
charge No.1 but found him guilty of charge No.2 partly, which findings at the 
face of it are not reconcilable in view of non-proving of charge No.1, being 
the main of the charges. 
19. 
 
It is evident from the record that the petitioners were held guilty 
of the charges on the basis of additional material, which was later on 
purportedly received by the Inquiry Officer from the complainant with regard 
to which it is specific stance of the petitioners that it was never confronted to 
them. Though inquiry report states that said material was confronted to the 
petitioners but there is no cogent evidence to this effect. Apparently for 
forming an opinion of guilt of the petitioners, statement of Masood Pervaiz 
recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
(hereinafter referred to as “Cr.P.C”) and his affidavit was made basis but his 
statement under section 164 “Cr.P.C” cannot be used against the delinquent 
employee without even affording him an opportunity to conduct cross-
examination upon the person, who made such statement. Even otherwise, for 
the use of statement under section 164 “Cr.P.C”, there is a mode provided 
under said Code, which was not adopted at all. Furthermore, in his statement 
as well as affidavit, Masood Pervaiz nowhere named the petitioners as his 
culprits. There is no cavil to the proposition that in departmental 
proceedings, standard of proof of the allegations cannot be equated with the 
standard of evidence against an accused in a criminal trial but one cannot

                   W.P.No.2832 of 2021 
                   W.P.No.3243 of 2021 
 
 
 
ignore the principle of natural justice while inflicting even meagre penalty 
upon a person as it amounts to deprive him from the right of earning. Right of 
fair trial, even otherwise, is guaranteed by the “Constitution”. 
20. 
 
I am cognizant of the fact that though jurisdiction of this Court 
under Article 199 of the “Constitution” to some extent is limited with respect 
to the orders ensuing from the departmental proceedings determining the 
guilt or otherwise of an employee but this Court being custodian of the rights 
of citizens cannot shut its eyes when the patent illegalities are floating on the 
surface of the record. Right of earning is right to life and no one can be 
allowed to take away such right in a clandestine manner. The petitioners 
were proceeded against in a non-transparent and haphazard manner in the 
departmental proceedings, which culminated into their dismissal from 
service. The impugned orders are apparently suffering with patent illegalities 
and against the principles of natural justice. 
21. 
 
For the foregoing reasons, this petition (W.P.No.2832 of 2021) 
as well as connected W.P.No.3243 of 2021 is allowed. As a result, the inquiry 
report, dismissal order dated 21st January, 2019 and order passed in appeal 
dated 29th June, 2021 are set aside being illegal and unlawful. As a sequel, 
the petitioners are reinstated in service with all permissible back benefits. No 
order as to costs.
