Lahore High Court, Lahore through its Registrar 
 
J U D G M E N T 
 
Date of hearing:     
  24.04.2024. 
Appellant by: 
 In person. 
 
Respondent by: 
 Mr. Zawar Ahmad Sheikh, Advocate. 
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J. / CHAIRMAN:- 
Through instant appeal, appellant has assailed order dated 22.11.2021, 
passed by respondent, whereby appellant’s request for grant of 
proforma promotion as District & Sessions Judge to the extent of 
pensionary benefits was declined.  
2.  Brief facts of the case are that appellant was dismissed from 
service on 28.03.2011, however the said order was set aside by this 
Tribunal vide judgment dated 17.06.2016, passed in Service Appeal 
No.25 of 2011. Respondent assailed said decision before the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in Civil Appeal No.2364 of 2016, which was 
accepted and matter was remanded to this Tribunal for decision 
afresh. In post remand proceedings, this Tribunal vide judgment dated 
28.04.2017, converted appellant’s punishment of compulsory 
retirement into censure whereas prayer regarding reinstatement and 
back benefits was declined. Appellant challenged said decision by 
way of filing Civil Petition No.1728-L of 2017 (Civil Appeal No.1562 
of 2017), and the Supreme Court of Pakistan vide order dated 
24.11.2017 directed the authority to decide the question of back 
benefits in the light of decisions of the Apex Court. Later on, vide

which he remained out of service till the date of superannuation was 
treated as on duty for the purposes of financial back benefits. Vide 
letter dated 10.09.2018, it was clarified that a vacant post of 
Additional District & Sessions Judge was available for the intervening 
period, so appellant was advised to draw the admissible financial back 
benefits against the said vacant post. Appellant made request for grant 
of proforma promotion to the rank of District and Sessions Judge for 
grant of pensionary benefits, however the same was declined and 
communicated vide letter dated 22.11.2021. Hence, instant appeal. 
3. 
Appellant, in person, submits that impediments i.e. pending 
disciplinary proceedings and complaints in the way of appellant’s 
promotion had been removed, hence there was no lawful justification 
to deny proforma promotion and pensionary benefits to appellant. He 
has referred to Divisional Superintendent, N.W.R., Lahore v. 
Muhammad Sharif, Booking Clerk, N.W.R. Gujrat (PLD 1963 
Supreme Court 340), Muhammad Sharif and others v. Inspector 
General of Police, Punjab, Lahore and others (2021 SCMR 962) and 
Muhammad Afzal Khan v. Registrar, Lahore High Court, Lahore and 
others [2016 PLC (C.S.) 408]. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent submits that 
appellant was ignored for promotion on 04.12.2009, however he filed 
the representation on 17.05.2018, which was barred by time. He adds 
that even the appeal in hand having been filed in December, 2021 is 
also barred by time inasmuch as the same is not accompanied by 
application for condonation of delay.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
Perusal of record reveals that appellant was considered for 
promotion as District and Sessions Judge in the meeting of the then 
Provincial Judicial Selection Board held on 04.12.2009, however he 
was ignored, keeping in view the working paper prepared by the 
respondent which reflected that (i) appellant’s PER for the year 2005 
was yet to be recorded;  (ii) PER for the period from 15.07.2008 to 
31.12.2008 contained adverse remarks qua integrity and fitness for 
promotion; (iii) pursuant to order dated 30.04.2009 of the 

 
Service Appeal No.14 of 2021 
3
Administration Committee, disciplinary proceedings, on the charges 
of using Government money which was in possession of Civil Nazir 
and for not returning the same, were pending against the appellant; 
and (iv) three Complaints bearing C.O.Nos.350/2009, 790/2009 and 
852/2009 were pending against appellant.   
7. 
We have gone through the record presented before us and it 
reflects that there was nothing adverse in the PER of appellant up to 
the year 2004, and PERs for the years 2006, 2007 and for the period 
from 31.03.2008 to 05.07.2008 were also clear. It has been apprised 
that PER for the period 01.01.2005 to 03.10.2005 has not been 
recorded by the Federal Government, however it is not the case of 
respondent that appellant had any fault in this regard. We are of the 
opinion that the appellant cannot be penalized by the act of the public 
functionaries in the light of dictum laid down by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in case reported as Muhammad Yasin v. Secretary, 
Government of Punjab and others (2007 SCMR 1769). 
  
It is also a matter of record that complaints bearing 
C.O.Nos.350/2009, 790/2009 and 852/2009 had been filed on 
25.01.2012, 05.01.2012 and 05.01.2012, respectively.  
 
The adverse remarks in appellant’s PER for the period from 
15.07.2008 to 31.12.2008 still exist as appellant’s representation in 
this regard had been declined. Appellant’s PER for the period 
28.07.2009 to 31.12.2009 is clear. In appellant’s PER for the period 
01.01.2010 to 31.12.2010, the Reporting Officer declared appellant as 
an average officer, however the Countersigning Officer observed that 
discreet inquiry report was against appellant, however no such 
material qua inquiry is available on record. Later on, appellant was 
compulsorily retired from service in the year 2011 and he remained 
under litigation till the age of superannuation, therefore, appellant’s 
PERs for the years from 2011 to 2016 are not available on record and 
in this regard there is no fault of the appellant especially when the 
litigation qua disciplinary proceedings and other complaints ended in 
appellant’s favour.

The disciplinary proceedings initiated on the orders of the 
Administration Committee culminated in passing order of appellant’s 
compulsory retirement from service notified on 28.03.2011, which 
was finally converted into censure vide judgment dated 28.04.2017, 
passed by this Tribunal. The intervening period viz., 29.09.2011 to 
19.12.2016 (appellant’s retirement on attaining the age of 
superannuation) was declared as on duty and back benefits of the 
aforesaid period (as Additional District and Sessions Judge) were 
granted. We feel it appropriate to observe here that under well-settled 
principles of law, promotion cannot be deferred on the ground of 
pendency of some disciplinary or departmental proceedings, if 
otherwise he has fulfilled the criteria for consideration of promotion. 
Reference can be made to Mohammad Tarique Khan v. Trading 
Corporation of Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chairman and 5 others 
[2024 PLC (C.S.) 91]. 
8. 
It is manifest from available record and preceding discussion that 
all the hurdles which prevailed upon the then Provincial Judicial 
Selection Board, detailed in para 6, have been vanished, thus, we are 
of the view that appellant has vested right to be considered for 
proforma promotion with consequential seniority and monetary 
benefits even after his retirement. There is no cavil to the proposition 
that it is an inalienable right of every civil servant that he be 
considered for promotion along with his batch mates when he fulfills 
eligibility criteria. We are fortified from the dictum laid down in cases 
reported as Abdul Jabbar Khan v. Government of Sindh through Chief 
Secretary, Karachi and 5 others (1996 SCMR 850) and Wadhu Mal 
v. Province of Sindh through Principal Secretary Chief Minister and 3 
others [2023 PLC (C.S.) 1310]. 
9. 
So far as argument of learned counsel for respondent that 
appellant’s representation was time barred, suffice it to say that 
disciplinary proceedings started against appellant in the year 2009 and 
remained pending when he attained the age of superannuation, 
however culminated vide judgment dated 28.04.2017 by way of 
conversion of compulsory retirement into censure, and regarding back 

 
Service Appeal No.14 of 2021

benefits, the Supreme Court of Pakistan vide order dated 24.11.2017 
directed the authority to decide the same. Ultimately, back benefits 
were granted as reflected from letter dated 12.05.2020, issued by 
District & Sessions Judge, Rahim Yar Khan and report dated 
08.05.2020, issued by the District Accounts Officer, Rahim Yar Khan. 
In view of peculiar facts and circumstances and our opinion that 
appellant is entitled to the grant of proforma promotion; the objection 
qua limitation is not tenable.  
10. In view of the above, instant appeal is allowed and impugned 
order is set aside. Appellant is entitled to the grant of proforma 
promotion and consequent monetary benefits as per law.
