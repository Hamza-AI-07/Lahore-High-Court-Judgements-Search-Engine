Amraf Butt    Versus     Imran Bashir, etc. 
 
J U D G M E N T 
Date of Hearing: 
09.03.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Rai Abdul Basit, Advocate.  
Respondent No.1 by: Mr. Irfan Ahmad Khichi, Advocate. 
       Anwaar Hussain, J.  Briefly stated facts of the case are that 
respondent No.1 (“the respondent”) filed a guardian petition under 
Section 25 of the Guardians & Wards Act, 1890 seeking permanent 
custody of his minor son, namely, Khidar Imran („the minor‟) born 
from the wedlock with the petitioner who also filed a separate guardian 
petition. On 11.05.2019, visitation schedule was chalked out and 
consolidated issues were framed. During the pendency of the said 
guardian petitions, the learned Guardian Judge accepted an application 
of the respondent, vide order dated 11.05.2019, whereby direction to 
the petitioner was sought to facilitate appearance of the minor before 
the authority concerned for issuance of American passport of the 
minor. However, subsequently, the respondent moved an application 
for withdrawal of his guardian petition, which was accordingly 
allowed, vide order dated 24.05.2021 and the guardian petition of the 
respondent was dismissed as withdrawn. After withdrawal of the 
guardian petition, the respondent moved an application for issuance of 
Robkar and implementation/execution of order dated 11.05.2019. The 
learned Guardian Judge, Lahore, vide order dated 28.10.2021, directed 
the petitioner to comply with order dated 11.05.2019. Feeling 
aggrieved, the petitioner preferred an appeal, which was dismissed by 
the learned Appellate Court below, vide order dated 24.01.2022, hence, 
the present constitutional petition has been filed.

2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner maintains that the impugned 
order was passed without providing an opportunity of hearing to the 
petitioner. He further states that the guardian petition filed by the 
respondent was dismissed as withdrawn, vide order dated 24.05.2021, 
therefore, the interim order dated 11.05.2019 earlier passed merged 
into the final order of withdrawal and ceased to have any effect. Adds 
that resultantly, order dated 11.05.2019 is not holding the field on 
account of doctrine of merger, therefore, the same cannot be 
implemented and the learned Courts below without keeping in view 
this factual and legal position has directed the petitioner to comply with 
order dated 11.05.2019 that is an error apparent on the record and 
merits interference by this Court.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent submits that 
guardian petition filed by the respondent was withdrawn for the time 
being only in view of the fact that the minor is of tender age and 
requires attention of the petitioner, being the real mother. Adds that 
prior to the withdrawal of the guardian petition, order dated 11.05.2019 
was passed by the learned Guardian Judge directing the petitioner to 
facilitate the issuance of the American passport of the minor and said 
order, after it was upheld in appeal, was also assailed by the petitioner 
before this Court by filing constitutional petition bearing Writ Petition 
No.64803/2019 which was dismissed on 18.01.2021. As order dated 
18.01.2021 passed by this Court is holding the field, the matter cannot 
be reopened before this Court. When confronted, learned counsel for 
the petitioner, in rebuttal, submits that order dated 18.01.2021 of this 
Court has been challenged before the Supreme Court of Pakistan by 
filing Civil Petition for Leave to Appear (“CPLA”), however, he 
candidly concedes that the said order has not been suspended so far. 
Adds that the CPLA has also become infructuous because the guardian 
petition filed by the respondent has been withdrawn by the respondent.

5. 
The legal questions that require opinion of this Court are 
articulated as under: 
(i) 
Whether the interim order, passed in a guardian petition 
filed by the respondent which was consolidated with the 
guardian petition filed by the petitioner, holds the field after the 
guardian petition filed by the respondent was dismissed as 
withdrawn? 
(ii) 
If the above referred interim order dated 11.05.2019 
directing the petitioner to ensure presence of the minor before 
the US Embassy for preparation of passport of the latter is 
holding the field, whether the same is required to be 
implemented being in welfare of the minor?  
6. 
At the outset, it is observed that the argument of the petitioner as 
to interim order dated 11.05.2019 dissipating in the air on account of 
withdrawal of the main lis i.e., the guardian petition filed by the 
respondent is misconceived, to say the least, on two counts. Firstly, the 
order dated 11.05.2019 directing the petitioner to facilitate the presence 
of the minor before the US Embassy for issuance of the American 
passport to the minor as a measure for the welfare of the minor in his 
future endeavours in general and pursuit of education in particular has 
been upheld up to the level of this Court and in the meanwhile the 
guardian petition filed by the respondent was withdrawn. Contention of 
the respondent that he has not pressed his guardian petition realizing 
that the minor is of tender age and the petitioner who is real mother 
should be given preference and that the respondent felt satisfied and 
contended in the interest and well-being of the minor with the visitation 
schedule chalked out by the learned Trial Court needs appreciation as it 
is not so common practice in our society as the parents get carried 
away by the egos and prejudices in litigation, at the cost of the welfare 
of the minor, and its concomitant psychological toll on the minor. It is 

4 
W.P. No.6959 of 2022 
 
 
also imperative to observe that withdrawal of guardian petition filed by 
the respondent does not mean that an interim order passed therein 
directing the petitioner to facilitate the issuance of American passport 
of the minor ceased to have effect as this would amount to preferring 
technicalities over the welfare of the minor that is supposed to be of 
paramount consideration and is an on-going phenomenon that cannot 
be circumscribed by some mathematical calculation or hyper-
technicalities of civil procedure as the welfare of the minor cannot be 
sacrificed at the altar of procedural niceties. More so, when the said 
interim order was admittedly assailed by the petitioner by filing 
constitutional petition bearing Writ Petition No.64803/2019 and the 
order dated 11.05.2019 was upheld by this Court on 18.01.2021 well 
before the withdrawal of the guardian petition on 24.05.2021. 
Therefore, even if the doctrine of merger is to be applied to the facts of 
the present case, interim order dated 11.05.2019 upheld vide order 
dated 12.07.2019 by the learned Appellate Court below merged into 
order dated 18.01.2021 of this Court passed in constitutional petition 
No.64803/2019 and the subsequent withdrawal of the guardian petition 
for the reasons mentioned hereinabove does not affect the execution 
and implementation of order dated 11.05.2019 and the same does not 
render the order dated 11.05.2019 non-existent.  
7. 
Secondly, it is matter of record that the petitioner‟s guardian 
petition was subsequent in time and was consolidated with the guardian 
petition of the respondent that was already pending. Admittedly, when 
the interim visitation schedule was chalked out on 11.05.2019, both the 
petitions were also consolidated and the issues were accordingly 
framed and on the same date interim order directing the petitioner to 
facilitate presence of the minor before US Embassy was passed. 
Meaning thereby that subsequent to the framing of the consolidated 
issues, both guardian petitions were heard together. Order dated 
11.05.2019 on the application of the respondent seeking direction to the 
petitioner to facilitate issuance of the American passport by all means 

5 
W.P. No.6959 of 2022 
 
 
was passed in consolidated proceedings and withdrawal of one 
guardian petition (of the respondent) does not mean that the entire 
matter came to an end and the order of withdrawal had the attire of the 
final order when admittedly the connected guardian petition of the 
petitioner remained pending. Therefore, this Court is of considered 
opinion that the interim order directing the petitioner to facilitate the 
minor in getting American passport does not cease to have effect by 
mere withdrawal of guardian petition filed by the respondent once the 
proceedings were admittedly consolidated in nature and same benefited 
the petitioner to keep the permanent custody of the minor as her 
guardian petition remained pending. 
8. 
Adverting to the second question, it is imperative to note that in 
the matters emanating from the guardianship proceedings welfare of 
the minor is to be taken as the most important/paramount factor. This 
aspect of the case has been examined by this Court in order dated 
18.01.2021 passed in Writ Petition No.64803/2019, operative part 
thereof is reproduced as under: 
“5……There is no dispute that respondent No.3 is U.S. 
citizen and he wants to apply for the passport of his 
minor son before change in the policy of U.S. 
Government. Admittedly the minor is also a Pakistani 
citizen, therefore, after obtaining U.S. passport, his status 
will be of a dual national, which is permissible under law. 
The U.S. passport for the minor does not appear to be 
against the welfare of the minor rather it will be helpful 
for his future education and job prospects as argued by 
learned counsel for the respondent No.3. So far as the 
apprehension of the petitioner that respondent No.3 may 
misuse the passport for taking the minor out of country is 
concerned, suffice it to note that learned Guardian Judge 
has already taken care of this apprehension by directing 
the respondent No.3, that the passport shall remain in 
custody of the petitioner mother or the person who shall 
be entitled for the guardianship of the minor as per law.”

W.P. No.6959 of 2022 
 
 
This Court while upholding the interim order dated 11.05.2019 has 
held the direction to the petitioner to facilitate issuance of American 
passport of the minor to be in welfare of the minor and acceptance of 
the present petition amounts to review of order dated 18.01.2021 
quoted hereinabove, which is not permissible under the law.  
9. 
In view of above discussion, the present petition is misconceived 
and hence, dismissed. No order as to costs.
