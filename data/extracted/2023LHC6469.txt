Through

petition, 
Abdul 
Rehman 
(petitioner/accused) seeks post-arrest bail in case arising out of 
F.I.R. No.126/2023 dated: 01.05.2023 registered under Sections: 
302, 148, 149 PPC at Police Station: Mitha Tiwana, District: 
Khushab.  
 
2.   
After hearing learned counsel for the parties, learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General and going through the available record with 
their able assistance, it has been noticed that briefly, as per crime 
report (F.I.R.) got recorded by Muhammad Sadiq (complainant), 
on 01.05.2023 at about 08:40 p.m. five accused persons (whose 
names were not mentioned in the F.I.R.) while two of them armed 
with pistols whereas three armed with hunters, stopped Ahmad 
Nawaz (maternal nephew of the complainant) when he was about 
to cross Railway Phatak, three persons who were armed with 
hunters gave blows with hunters to Ahmad Nawaz (mentioned 
above) whereas two accused persons who were armed with pistols 
caused firearm injuries to Ahmad Nawaz, who became severely 
injured and succumbed to the injuries on the way to the hospital. 
Though petitioner was not nominated in the first information 
report, however, on Court’s query learned Deputy Prosecutor 
General under instructions of the police official (present before the 
Court) and after himself going through the available record 
apprises that petitioner was arrested under Section: 54 Cr.P.C. on 
10.05.2023, sent to jail on the same day and was duly identified 

                             Crl. Misc. No.62271-B of 2023 
2 
during identification test parade on 18.05.2023 by Muhammad 
Sadiq (complainant) and eyewitnesses, namely, Muhammad 
Nawaz and Muhammad Ashraf that he was the person who was 
armed with hunter at the time of occurrence; further apprises that 
hunter was recovered from him and after thorough investigation, 
he has been found involved in the occurrence. Therefore, 
reasonable grounds are available on the record to connect the 
petitioner with the commission of alleged offence and punishment 
of the same does fall in the ambit of prohibition contained in 
Section: 497 Cr.P.C.  
 
So far as ground of juvenility of the petitioner is 
concerned, suffice it to say that as per birth certificate of the 
petitioner annexed with this petition (available at page No.16 of 
the instant petition), date of birth of the petitioner has been 
mentioned as 08.01.2007 meaning thereby that he was more than 
sixteen years of age on the day of occurrence i.e. 01.05.2023, 
therefore, when there are reasonable grounds available on the 
record to connect the petitioner with the commission of heinous 
offence then he does not deserve concession of bail even on the 
ground of juvenility and in this regard, sub-Section: (4) of 
Section: 6 of the Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018 can be 
advantageously referred which is hereby reproduced for ready 
reference :- 
“6(4) Where a juvenile of more than sixteen years of 
age is arrested or detained for a heinous offence, he 
may not be released on bail if the Juvenile Court is of 
the opinion that there are reasonable grounds to believe 
that such juvenile is involved in commission of a 
heinous offence.” 
 
Furthermore, heinous offence has been defined under sub-
Section: (g) of Section: (2) of the Act ibid which is hereby 
reproduced:- 
“2(g) “heinous offence” means an offence which is 
serious, gruesome, brutal, sensational in character or 
shocking to public morality and which is punishable 
under the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (Act XLV of 1860)  

                             Crl. Misc. No.62271-B of 2023 
3 
or any other law for the time being in force with death 
or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for more than 
seven years with or without fine.” 
 
3. 
In view of what has been discussed above, instant petition 
filed by the petitioner for grant of post-arrest bail is without 
merits and same is hereby dismissed. It goes without saying that 
observations made hereinabove are just tentative in nature, strictly 
confined to the disposal of instant bail petition and will have no 
bearing upon trial of the case.
