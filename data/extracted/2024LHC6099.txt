31.12.2024 Barrister Momin Malik with the Petitioner. 
 
Mr. Muhammad Mustafa Chaudhry, Deputy Prosecutor 
General, with Hina Imdad/SI. 
 
Mr. Ali Hussain Mohsin, Advocate, for the Complainant. 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Through this application, the 
Petitioner seeks pre-arrest bail in case FIR No.1546/2024 dated 
3.7.2024 registered at Police Station Peoples Colony, Faisalabad, for 
an offence under section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 (PPC). 
 
2. 
 
According to the FIR, the prosecution’s case is that the 
Petitioner owns a fabric shop in Tata Bazar near the ice factory in 
Faisalabad. He became acquainted with the Complainant through her 
frequent visits to purchase cloth. Over time, they developed a rapport, 
and the Complainant occasionally shared her domestic issues with 
him. The Complainant alleged that the Petitioner proposed that she 
run a boutique from her home. He offered to provide fabric worth  
Rs. 500,000/- on loan, with the agreement that she would repay  
Rs. 100,000/- every 15 days. He suggested that the arrangement 
would mutually benefit both parties. 
 
3. 
 
The Complainant asserted that on 2.7.2024, around 11:00 
a.m., the Petitioner invited her to Chen-One Road to visit a cloth 
warehouse. The Petitioner and an unknown person were already 
present when she reached there. The Complainant claimed that the 
Petitioner inappropriately touched her while the co-accused pointed a 
pistol at her, and then the Petitioner raped her. She further alleged that 
certain objectionable pictures and videos were taken, and the 

Crl. Misc. No.56457/B/2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
 
Petitioner and his co-accused threatened to leak the material if she 
disclosed the incident. 
4. 
 
The Complainant told Muhammad Ashfaq and Sarfraz 
Ali about the occurrence, who supported her in obtaining a medical 
examination through court orders. Subsequently, FIR No. 1546/2024 
was registered.  
 
5. 
 
The Petitioner applied for pre-arrest bail in the Sessions 
Court which was declined. He has now approached this Court seeking 
the same relief. 
 
6. 
 
The Petitioner’s counsel, Barrister Momin Malik, 
contended that the Complainant has falsely implicated the Petitioner 
with ulterior motives. He argued that the prosecution’s narrative, 
particularly the alleged financial arrangement, is inherently 
implausible. Mr. Malik further contended that the Complainant acted 
in collusion with her counsel’s clerk, Muhammad Ashfaq, who is a 
key prosecution witness. Additionally, he pointed out discrepancies in 
the medical examination record and the variance between the 
Complainant’s FIR and her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., 
arguing these inconsistencies warrant further inquiry. Mr. Malik 
submitted that the Petitioner is entitled to pre-arrest bail in the given 
circumstances. 
7. 
 
The Deputy Prosecutor General, assisted by the 
Complainant’s counsel, vehemently opposed this application. He 
contended that the Petitioner was nominated in the FIR with a specific 
allegation. The Complainant has recorded her statement under section 
164 Cr.P.C., implicating the Petitioner in the case, and her account is 
corroborated by medical evidence and a positive forensic report. The 
Deputy Prosecutor General refuted the claim of any discrepancy 
between the FIR and the Complainant’s statement under section 164 
Cr.P.C., adding that even if such a discrepancy existed, it was trivial 
and inconsequential. He, therefore, prayed for the dismissal of this 
application.

Hina Imdad/SI investigated this case. She concluded that 
the incident involved fornication rather than rape. Her findings were 
primarily based on CCTV footage, photographs, and WhatsApp 
messages exchanged between the Petitioner and the Complainant. 
9. 
 
Encouraged by the Investigating Officer’s findings,  
Mr. Malik raised an alternative plea that the alleged offence falls 
under section 496-B PPC rather than section 376 PPC. He pointed out 
that section 203-C Cr.P.C. prescribes a special procedure for 
prosecuting an offence under section 496-B PPC, and an action can 
only be initiated through a complaint filed in a court of competent 
jurisdiction. He argued that the offence under section 496-B PPC is 
non-cognizable so an FIR could not be registered. Furthermore, the 
said offence is bailable. 
Discussion 
 
10. 
 
Rape is universally recognized as one of the most 
heinous crimes, representing a profound violation of personal dignity, 
bodily autonomy, and fundamental human rights. It is not merely a 
physical assault but an act of violence and domination that strikes at 
the very core of a person’s sense of self. Beyond its immediate 
physical impact, rape is an extremely traumatic event with lasting 
emotional, psychological, and social consequences. A murderer 
destroys the physical body of his victim, while a rapist degrades their 
very soul.1 
 
11. 
 
Legal systems worldwide criminalize rape, with varying 
definitions and evidentiary requirements. However, the fundamental 
principle remains the same: it is a crime of violence, coercion, and 
domination. It is not merely an offence against an individual but 
against the entire society. 
 
12. 
 
Article 14 of our Constitution mandates that dignity shall 
be inviolable. This is an absolute right and is not subject to law. 
“Dignity means human worth: simply put, every person matters. No 
life is dispensable, disposable, or demeanable. Every person has a

right to live, and the right to live means right to live with dignity.”2 
Our courts have consistently held that a woman, regardless of her 
sexual character or reputation, is entitled to equal protection of the 
law. No one has the right to invade her person or violate her privacy 
based on her alleged immoral character. In rape cases, the victim’s 
prior sexual history and character is irrelevant; the critical issue is 
whether the accused committed the act.3  
 
13. 
 
The Pakistan Penal Code criminalizes rape under section 
375. It defines the offence comprehensively, encompassing acts 
beyond traditional notions of penile penetration, such as the insertion 
of any object or body part (other than the penis) into the vagina, 
urethra, or anus and oral acts performed on or by the victim. The 
definition also covers situations where a perpetrator manipulates any 
part of the victim’s body to cause penetration into the vagina, urethra, 
anus, or any other part of the victim’s body or compels the victim to 
perform such acts with the accused or another person. Section 376 
PPC prescribes the punishment for rape, while section 375A PPC 
specifically addresses gang rape, imposing severe penalties for such 
crimes. 
 
14. 
 
Rape must be distinguished from fornication. Rape is a 
non-consensual act and, as adumbrated, rooted in violence, coercion, 
and domination, where the perpetrator disregards the victim’s 
autonomy and consent. In contrast, fornication refers to consensual 
sexual relations between individuals who are not married to each 
other. The Pakistan Penal Code addresses fornication in section  
496-B. It is punishable as a Ta’zir by up to five years’ imprisonment 
and a fine not exceeding ten thousand rupees.  
 
15. 
 
Section 203-C Cr.P.C. prescribes a special procedure for 
prosecuting the offence of fornication. Most importantly, it mandates 
that no court shall take cognizance of such an offence except upon a 
complaint filed in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Since consent is pivotal in determining the offence of 
rape, we need to examine it in more detail. Section 375 PPC outlines 
seven specific circumstances under which the law deems there is no 
consent if a perpetrator commits any of the acts specified in clauses 
(a) to (d) of the section. These include, firstly, when these acts are 
committed against the victim’s will and, secondly, when they are done 
without the victim’s consent.  
17. 
 
In Muhammad Ashraf v. The State (1997 PCr.LJ 1351), 
the Federal Shariat Court, while interpreting section 6 of the Offence 
of Zina (Enforcement of Hadood) Ordinance 1979, clarified the 
distinction between “against the will” and “without consent,” holding 
that both scenarios constitute Zina-bil-Jabar (rape). The Court 
referred to Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary, and noted that 
the term “will,” refers to the “power or faculty of choosing or 
determining, act of using this power; volition, choice; determination.” 
In contrast, “consent” signifies “to be of the same mind; to agree to 
give assent; to yield; to comply.” The Court explained that consent 
necessarily implies agreement as a free agent, with the presence of a 
free mind and free will. Therefore, when an individual (victim) is 
subjected to an act that they would not have consented to or permitted 
had they been free to make a genuine choice, such an act is deemed to 
have been done against their will. In other words, the key question is 
whether the individual would have acted in the same manner if they 
had a real choice to act differently. If the availability of choice was 
illusory or rendered redundant by the circumstances, the act in 
question is considered to have been carried out against the 
individual’s will.  The Court further stated that the absence of a 
genuine choice or the ability to exercise free will may arise from 
various factors, such as the position of dominance or authority held by 
the perpetrator, fiduciary obligations, supervisory control, or the 
victim’s dependence on the perpetrator. The Court observed that 
Muslim jurists have discussed the subject of Jabar under the head of 
Ikrah and referring to the celebrated treatise of Dr. Abdul Karim 

Crl. Misc. No.56457/B/2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
 
Zaidan, Professor of Fiqah Islami, University of Baghdad, Iraq, 
concluded: 
“ ‘Ikrah’ may be inferred from the very situation in which a victim 
may find herself unable to protest or where the faculty to 
determine her course of action is so affected that she had no 
control over the action or the event or she would not have acted 
that way if left to make a choice. The very force of circumstances 
may constitute Jabr (Ikrah).  
18. 
 
The third situation is where the victim’s consent is 
obtained by putting them or any person in whom they are interested in 
fear of death or hurt. The fourth circumstance pertains to consent 
obtained through deception. If the perpetrator deceives the victim into 
believing they are lawfully married when they are not, and the victim 
consents based on this belief, the law considers such consent invalid. 
The fifth circumstance is when the victim is unable to understand the 
nature and consequences of the act due to unsoundness of mind, 
intoxication, or the administration of stupefying substances. Consent 
given under these conditions is considered invalid, as the victim lacks 
the capacity to make an informed decision. The sixth circumstance 
involves victims under the age of sixteen. The law categorically states 
that any sexual act involving a minor, whether or not consent is given, 
constitutes rape. This provision protects minors, recognizing their 
inability to provide valid consent due to their immaturity. The seventh 
circumstance arises when the victim is unable to communicate 
consent. This includes situations where the victim is unconscious, 
paralyzed, or otherwise physically or mentally incapacitated, leaving 
them unable to express agreement. The inability to communicate 
consent negates any presumption of its presence, ensuring that 
vulnerable individuals are safeguarded under the law. 
19. 
 
Section 375 PPC includes several explanations that 
provide further clarity. Explanation 1 expands the definition of the 
term “vagina” to include the labia majora, ensuring comprehensive 
anatomical coverage. Explanation 2 elaborates on the concept of 
consent, emphasizing that it must be an unequivocal voluntary 
agreement to participate in a specific sexual act. Explanation 3 
broadens the scope of the law by defining a “person” to include males, 

Crl. Misc. No.56457/B/2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
 
females, and transgender individuals, ensuring inclusivity in its 
application. Explanation 4 explicitly excludes bonafide medical 
procedures or interventions from the definition of rape, preventing the 
misuse of the provision. 
20. 
 
The principles underlying section 375 PPC are further 
reinforced by section 90 PPC, which provides a general framework 
for determining the validity of consent in the broader context of 
criminal law.4  
21. 
 
The expressions “unequivocal voluntary agreement” and 
“specific sexual act” in Explanation 2 of section 375 PPC are 
significant. Consent must be an affirmative and conscious decision, 
clearly communicated through words, gestures, or other verbal or non-
verbal forms of expression. It must be given freely, without pressure 
or coercion. Silence, passivity, or lack of resistance cannot be deemed 
consent. Moreover, consent is not a blanket authorization but is 
confined to what is explicitly agreed. If a victim initially consents to a 
particular act but later withdraws that consent, or if the accused 
continues the act despite the withdrawal or engages in a different act 
for which consent was not given, the law unequivocally classifies the 
act as non-consensual, thereby constituting rape.5 
 
22. 
 
The determination of consent in rape cases is often 
complex and fact-specific.6 The burden of proving the absence of 
consent initially lies with the prosecution, which can be discharged by 
presenting credible evidence, typically including the victim’s 
testimony, medical examination reports, and forensic evidence. Since 
the offence of rape generally occurs in private, finding independent 
                                                   
4 Section 90 PPC reads as follows: 
90.  
Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.– A consent is not such a consent as is 
intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury or under a 
misconception of fact and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was 
given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or  
Consent of insane person.– if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, 
or intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his 
consent; or 
 
Consent of child.– Unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a 
person who is under twelve years of age. 
5 See: R v. Kirkpatrick (2022 SCC 33) (Supreme Court of Canada).

witnesses is challenging. Consequently, the victim’s solitary statement 
can suffice to secure a conviction in a rape case, provided that it is 
trustworthy, consistent, and reliable.7  
 
23. 
 
In cases where direct evidence is unavailable, 
circumstantial evidence plays a pivotal role in guiding judicial 
reasoning and determining the presence of consent. This includes 
factors such as the victim’s physical condition, injuries suggesting 
resistance, forensic findings like DNA evidence linking the accused to 
the crime, the timing and sequence of events, or communication 
records such as messages or calls between the parties. However, it is 
essential to emphasize that the absence of injuries on the victim’s 
body or signs of physical resistance does not automatically indicate 
consent. As discussed, Explanation 2 of section 375 PPC explicitly 
provides that physical resistance is not a prerequisite for establishing 
non-consensual intercourse. 
 
24. 
 
In Muhammad Imran v. The State and another 
(Criminal Petition No. 725/2023, decided on 26.06.2024),8 Justice 
Ayesha A. Malik stated that there is no assumption, either in law or 
practice, that a woman gave her consent simply because there are no 
marks of resistance. She observed that the offence of rape deeply 
affects the victim, both physically and psychologically. According to 
expert psychiatrists, victims of trauma, particularly sexual violence, 
may exhibit “fight, flight, or freeze” responses, with the freeze 
response often rendering them incapable of taking protective action. 
This reflexive reaction to fear or threat is highly subjective and varies 
from individual to individual. Moreover, the use of force, 
intimidation, and the trauma of the act itself can result in responses 
that are unpredictable and unique to each victim. Consequently, there 
is no universal or predictable behaviour for victims of rape, nor can 
their response – or lack thereof – be used as conclusive evidence 
against them.

others v. The State (PLD 2021 SC 550), Muhammad Imran v. The State and another (Criminal Petition No.725/2023 
decided on 26.06.2024, per Ayesha A. Malik, J.), State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh and others (AIR 1996 SC 1393).

25. 
 
Once the prosecution has discharged its initial burden, 
the burden of proof shifts to the accused to substantiate claims of 
consent. Under Articles 117 and 119 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, 
the accused bears the onus to provide credible evidence of consent. 
This may include evidence of a pre-existing consensual relationship, 
communications suggesting mutual agreement, or an alternative 
explanation for the prosecution’s evidence. The accused is not 
required to prove consent beyond a reasonable doubt but must raise a 
credible and plausible defence sufficient to create reasonable doubt in 
the prosecution’s case. Failure to do so can result in a finding of guilt. 
 
26. 
 
The court’s role is critical in balancing these shifting 
burdens. It must rigorously scrutinize the prosecution’s evidence to 
ensure it meets the high threshold of proving the absence of consent 
beyond a reasonable doubt. At the same time, the court must evaluate 
the accused’s evidence or defence to assess its plausibility and 
credibility.  
 
27. 
 
Let’s now turn to the case at hand. The Complainant has 
nominated the Petitioner in the FIR, alleging that he exploited their 
interactions and raped her. She has also accused him of threatening 
her and taking objectionable pictures to coerce her into silence. She 
reiterated these allegations in her statement recorded under section 
164 Cr.P.C. Medical and forensic evidence confirm that sexual 
intercourse occurred on the relevant day.  
28. 
 
During the investigation, the police concluded that the 
case involved fornication rather than rape. These findings are 
essentially based on CCTV footage, pictures, and WhatsApp 
messages exchanged between the parties. While this evidence 
suggests a close relationship, possibly closer than the Complainant 
acknowledges, it does not definitively establish whether the act was 
consensual. This critical determination requires thorough scrutiny of 
all the evidence during the trial. 
29. 
 
As previously discussed, under section 375 PPC, threats, 
intimidation, or coercion invalidate consent. Therefore, if proven, the 

Crl. Misc. No.56457/B/2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
 
allegations of pointing a pistol and threatening to release 
objectionable content would render any apparent consent irrelevant. 
The trial court is the appropriate forum to evaluate the evidence, 
including the CCTV footage, WhatsApp messages, and other material, 
to determine the nature of the offence. 
 
30. 
 
Pre-arrest bail is an extraordinary remedy reserved for 
cases where the accused can demonstrate that the FIR was lodged 
with mala fide intent, personal animosity, or the like. The Petitioner 
has failed to satisfy this requirement. Claims of inconsistencies in the 
prosecution’s evidence, such as discrepancies between the FIR and the 
Complainant’s statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., necessitate 
detailed scrutiny alongside other evidence. Such an evaluation is 
beyond the purview of a pre-arrest bail application. 
 
31. 
 
Considering the seriousness of the allegations and the 
absence of any exceptional circumstances justifying pre-arrest bail, 
this application is dismissed.
