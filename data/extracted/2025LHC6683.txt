JUDGMENT 
 
 
Date of hearing 
28.10.2025  
Revision-
Petitioner by 
Mr. Javed Anwar Janjua, learned 
Advocate. 
Respondent No. 
1  by 
Malik M Arshad Kundi, learned 
Advocate.  
 
 
 Sultan Tanvir Ahmad J:- On 03.09.2018 
the suit for specific performance, instituted by respondent    
No. 1, was decreed by the learned Appellate Court in the 
following manners:- 
  “…The impugned judgment and decree dated 
15.02.2018 is set-aside and suit of the 
appellant / plaintiff is decreed subject to the 
deposit of Rs. 35,19,000/- within a period of 
two months from this date. In case of failure, 
the suit shall be deemed to be dismissed and 
the earnest money shall be forfeited…”  
  
In pursuance to the above, respondent No. 1 
deposited the balance consideration on 05.11.2018.  
The learned executing Court allowed the objection raised 
by the revision-petitioner holding that the amount was 
deposited after delay of four days. Civil Appeal No. 4603-
96/23 was filed by respondent No. 1, which was allowed 
vide judgment dated 15.12.2023. 
2.  
 Mr.  Javed Anwar Janjua, learned counsel for 
the revision-petitioner, has submitted that the learned Court 
granted the decree on 03.09.2018 and respondent had sixty 

 
Civil Revision No. 84423 of 2023    (Judgment) 
 
 
2 
days to deposit the balance consideration, which lapsed on 
01.11.2018, therefore, by the time of deposit the learned 
Court became functus officio and the suit stood dismissed. 
Malik M. Arshad Kundi, learned counsel for respondent 
No. 1, while opposing this civil revision, has referred to 
several judgments including the cases titled “Puran Chand 
Versus Mohd. Din and Others” (A.I.R. 1935 Lahore 291) 
and “Muhammad Amin Versus Muhammad Latif” (PLD 
1996 Lahore 321). 
3.  
Learned Peshawar High Court in case titled 
“Sher Muhammad and 06 Others Versus Gul Fraz” (1989 
CLC 1344) has already settled that the term month 
employed in contracts denotes a period terminating with the 
day of succeeding month numerically, corresponding to the 
day of its beginning, less one. Section 9 of the General 
Clauses Act-1897 (the ‘GCA-1897) provides that it shall be 
sufficient for the purpose of excluding the first in a series of 
days or any other period of time, to use the word ‘from’, 
and, for the purpose of including the last in a series of days 
or any other period of time, to use the word ‘to’. The 
Limitation Act-1908 (the ‘Limitation Act’) also permits 
that for the purpose of instituting appeal or application, the 
day on which the judgment complained of was pronounced 
is to be excluded. In “Messrs Tribal Friends Co. Versus 
Province of Balochistan” (2002 SCMR 1903) it is 
observed that section 9 of the GCA-1897 is not limited to 
statutes or notifications but is applied for computing the 
period of limitation as fixed in any judgment, decree or 
order. Thus, day of decree i.e. 03.09.2018 is required to be 
excluded. Further reference, if so required, can be made to 
the cases titled “Messrs Malik Muhammad Nawaz, Haji 
Aziz Ahmad Commission Agents, Chakwal Versus Syed 
Mehmood Hussain” (1997 SCMR 264) and “Muhammad 
Yousuf and 3 Others Versus Zafarullah and another” (1992 

 
Civil Revision No. 84423 of 2023    (Judgment) 
 
 
3 
SCMR 117).  
4.  
03.11.2018 was Saturday and 04.11.2018 was 
Sunday. BPRD circular No. 08 of 2018 dated 16.05.2018 
issued by the State Bank of Pakistan is also produced, 
which reflects working days for deposit in the concerned 
bank account were from Monday to Friday.  
5.  
In case titled “Nijabat Khan Versus Nur 
Ahmad and 7 Others” (PLD 1957 (W.P.) Lahore 92) this 
Court has expressed the view that effect of refusal by 
treasury or the bank to accept or deposit at any time within 
the Court hours is that we should regard the treasury or the 
bank as being closed on that day and should give the party 
concerned the benefit as he would have if the treasury or 
the bank was closed. As per section 10 of the GCA-1897 if 
Court or office is closed on the day when an act is to be 
performed therein the act can be performed on the next 
opening day of the Court or office. Section 4 of the 
Limitation Act provides that period of limitation when 
expires on a day when the Court is closed, suit or appeal or 
application may be preferred on the day the Court reopens.  
6.  
In “Messrs Malik Muhammad Nawaz, Haji 
Aziz Ahmad Commission Agents, Chakwal Versus Syed 
Mehmood Hussain” (1997 SCMR 264) the Honourable 
Supreme Court of Pakistan excluded last two closed-
holidays. Paragraphs No. 8 and 9 of the said judgment are 
relevant:- 
8.  
A perusal of the above-quoted para. 
indicates that in case of any Statute or Rules, a 
calendar month is taken as the period on one 
month running from an arbitrary date, which 
would expire with the day in the succeeding month 
immediately preceding the day corresponding the 
date upon which the period starts. However, by 
virtue of Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, 
period of one month for the purpose of an order is 
computed by excluding the date on which order is 
passed. 
 

 
Civil Revision No. 84423 of 2023    (Judgment) 
 
 
4 
9.  
In the case in hand, if we were to apply the 
above ratio, one month period in the present case 
was to expire on 21-6-1996, which was Friday; 
whereas 22-6-1996 was Saturday (a closed 
holiday) and thus 23-6-1996 was the last day for 
the purpose of expiry of the above period of one 
month. There is no doubt that in the order dated 
21-5-1996, it was stated that "one month from 
today" but one could, on the basis of the above 
judgment and many other judgments of the 
superior Courts on section 9 of the General 
Clauses Act, think that the aforesaid period would 
expire on 21-6-1996. We are, therefore, inclined 
to grant further opportunity to the petitioner to 
furnish surety for the above suit amount on the 
condition stated herein below, though we are 
mindful of the fact that the petitioner had not acted 
diligently before the Courts below as is reflected 
in the narration of facts in the impugned judgment. 
                                 (Underlining is added) 
 
7.  
Mr. Javed Anwar Janjua, learned counsel for 
the revision-petitioner calculated the period granted for 
deposit in number of days and he argued that permitted 
sixty (60) days lapsed on 01.11.2018, therefore, the learned 
Court became functus officio. He referred to the case titled 
“Muhammad Wahid and another Versus Nasrullah and 
another” (2016 SCMR 179). In my opinion this calculation 
is based on incorrect interpretation of law. The case relied 
by him is distinguishable and has no relevance to the 
present one. The Court becomes functus officio only once 
the period allowed for deposit was over. I agree with the 
submission of Malik M. Arshad Kundi, learned counsel for 
the respondent that the view adopted by the learned 
Appellate Court is fully justified.  
8.  
There being no merit in this civil revision, is 
dismissed, without any order as to costs.
