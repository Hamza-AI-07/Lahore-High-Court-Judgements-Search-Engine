2. 
The prosecution story as given in the opening paragraph of the 
impugned judgment passed by the trial court is reproduced as under:- 
I am former by profession and resident of Adhi Kot. 
Accused Dilshad s/o Muhammad Bashir borrowed 
money from my deceased son Muhammad Monawar 
aged 25/26 years six months before the occurrence for 
the marriage expenditure of his sister. My deceased 
son demanded the borrowed money from accused but 
accused Muhammad Dilshad behaved reluctantly to 
return the borrowed money. On 31.01.2018 my 
deceased son was going to shop from his house. I 
alongwith 
Muhammad 
Sarwar 
my 
son 
and 
Muhammad Awais s/o Muhammad Sarwar caste 
Rajpoot PWs were coming behind Muhammad 
Monawar deceased at some distance. Muhammad 
Monwar my deceased son when reached on the 
opposite side of house of Qari Abdul Wahid at about 
10:30 a.m. accused persons Dilshad armed with 
Qamanidar 
knife, 
Irshad, 
Mushtaq 
sons 
of 
Muhammad Bashir caste Rajpoot r/o village Adhi 
Kot appeared in front of Munawar my deceased son. 
Muhammad Monwar deceased son demanded to 
return 
the 
borrowed 
money 
from 
accused 
Muhammad Dilshad, at this accused Mushtaq raised 
lalkara and said we will taste him to demand 
borrowed money, meanwhile Dilshad has stabbed 
knife blow on the right side of the back (Peeth) of 
deceased Monawar, due to which he fell down on the 
ground. The occurrence was witnessed by me, 
Muhammad Sarwar and Muhammad Awais Pws. 
After seeing us accused Dilshad etc. ran away 
towards their house. Muhammad Monwar my 
deceased son was in injured condition, we shifted the 
injured on private vehicle to THQ hospital Noorpur 
Thal. 
Soon 
after 
reaching 
hospital 
my 
son 
Muhammad Monawar succumbed to the injuries in 
the hospital. Motive behind the occurrence is that 
accused Muhammad Dilshad borrowed money from 
my 
deceased 
son 
Muhammad 
Monawar. 
My 
deceased son demanded the same from Dilshad, due 
to this demand and grudge Dilshad etc. with common 
intention committed intentional murder of my son 
Muhammad Monawar. I was ready to go police 
station for registration of case but in the meanwhile 
Umar Farooq SI reached at Hospital after receiving 
the information, who record Farad Bayan Exh-PA on 
the statement of complainant which was read over to 

Crl. Appl. No. 59174 of 2019 and 
Crl. Rev. No. 59075 of 2019  
3
him and complainant signed it as token of correctness 
which bears his signatures as Exh-PA/1." 
 
3. 
After completion of investigation, report under section 173 
Cr.P.C. was submitted against the appellant. On indictment, the 
appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 
 In order to bring home the guilt of the appellant, the 
prosecution got examined as many as nine witnesses amongst whom 
Muhammad Iqbal complainant (PW1) and Muhammad Sarwar (PW7) 
have furnished the ocular account. Haji Mirza Muhammad Saeed, 
draftsman (PW6) prepared scaled site plan of the place of occurrence 
(Exh.PF and Exh.PF/1). Umar Farooq Shah S.I (PW8) being 
investigating officer stated about various steps taken by him during 
investigation of the case. Medical evidence was furnished by Doctor 
Zain ul Abiden (PW5), who while posted as Medical Officer at THQ 
Hospital Noorpur, conducted autopsy on the dead body of Muhammad 
Munawar (deceased) and issued his postmortem report (Exh.PC). The 
remaining prosecution witnesses, more or less, are formal in nature. 
The prosecution gave up Nazakat Ali 338/C and Muhammad Asif son 
of Muhammad Aslam, PWs being unnecessary and after tendering in 
evidence the reports of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore as 
Exh. PO and Exh. PP closed its evidence. 
4.  
After completion of prosecution evidence, statement under 
section 342 Cr. P.C. of the appellant was recorded wherein he refuted 
the allegations levelled against him and claimed his innocence. While 
answering to a question, “why this case against you and why the PWs 
deposed against you? appellant replied as under:- 
“The PWs are inter-see related, they have a criminal history 
and were having many enemies in the area. The PWs and 
the complainant have not advanced any reason of their 
presence at the place of occurrence, nor they adduced any 
physical circumstance of their presence at the place of 
occurrence. They are false motive witnesses, moreover, the 
PWs and the complainant involved our all adult members of 

Crl. Appl. No. 59174 of 2019 and 
Crl. Rev. No. 59075 of 2019  
4
the family in this occurrence. The story of the PWs was 
found false during the investigation of the case. These 
witnesses cannot be believed even against me. They have 
falsely involved me in this case.”  
 
He opted not to appear as his own witness within the scope of section 
340(2) Cr.P.C. but produced statement of PW Muhammad Sarwar 
recorded by I.O. u/s 161, Cr.P.C. on 31.01.2018 as Exh.  DA, certified 
copy of F.I.R No. 301 dated 24.06.2010 of police station Jauharabad 
u/s 489-F, P.P.C. Exh. PB, copy of F.I.R No. 120 dated 26.09.2003 
u/s 341, 342, 506, P.P.C. police station Noorpur Thal Mark-A, copy of 
F.I.R No. 55 dated 28.03.2014 u/s 337-F(5), P.P.C. of police station 
Noorpur Thal Mark-B and copy of F.I.R No. 02 dated 26.12.2013 u/s 
489-F P.P.C. of police station 18-Hazari, District Jhang Mark-C in his 
defence. 
5.  
The trial court vide impugned judgment held the appellant 
guilty, convicted and sentenced him as mentioned above, hence, this 
criminal appeal.  
6. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the appellant 
and learned Deputy Prosecutor General assisted by learned counsel 
for the complainant assiduously and also scanned the record minutely 
with their able assistance.   
 
7. 
The ocular account of the incident in question has been 
furnished by Muhammad Iqbal complainant (PW1) and Muhammad 
Sarwar (PW7) who were closely related to the deceased inasmuch as 
PW1 was his father and PW7 was real brother of the deceased. It is 
noteworthy that presence of the above mentioned eyewitnesses at the 
relevant time is highly unnatural. According to the statements of supra 
mentioned PWs the appellant borrowed money from Muhammad 
Munawar (deceased) for the marriage expenditure of his sister and 
deceased demanded money back but the appellant behaved reluctantly 

Crl. Appl. No. 59174 of 2019 and 
Crl. Rev. No. 59075 of 2019  
5
to return the borrowed money. On the fateful day the complainant’s 
son namely Muhammad Munawar was going to his shop and 
complainant as well as his son namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW7) and 
grandson Muhammad Naeem Ullah Awais (jettisoned PW) were 
behind him  at some distance and when they reached in front of house 
of Qari Abdul Wahid at 10.30 a.m., the appellant armed with clasp 
knife (کمانی دار چ
اقو) along with co-accused Irshad and Mushtaq (since 
acquitted) emerged in front of Muhammad Munawar (deceased) when 
Muhammad Munawar (deceased) demanded to return the borrowed 
money then co-accused Irshad and Mushtaq raised lalkara that he be 
taught a lesson for demanding amount whereupon Muhammad 
Dilshad appellant stabbed knife on the right side of the back of 
Muhammad Munawar (deceased), due to which he fell down in 
injured condition. The PWs shifted Muhammad Munawar to hospital 
and soon reaching in the hospital, he succumbed to the injuries. I have 
noted that Muhammad Iqbal complainant (PW1) was aged about 80 
years at the alleged time of occurrence and he has not stated that he 
used to sit at the shop with his son Muhammad Munawar (since 
deceased). Muhammad Iqbal (PW1) has also described about his other 
son namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW7) in his cross-examination as 
under:- 
 
“It is correct that my son Muhammad Sarwar PW is an 
employee of agriculture department. It is also correct the 
office of agriculture department is located on Quaidabad 
Road near Mitha Tiwana mor and at a distance of half 
an hour from place of occurrence” 
 
Similarly, Muhammad Sarwar (PW7) has stated in his cross-
examination as infra:-  
“I 
am 
permanent 
employee 
of 
the 
agriculture 
department. It is correct that the office of the agriculture 
department is located on the Quaidabad Road near 
Mitha Tiwana Morr. It is incorrect to suggest that the 
distance between my office and place of occurrence is 

Crl. Appl. No. 59174 of 2019 and 
Crl. Rev. No. 59075 of 2019  
6
nearly 5KM. Volunteers it is at a distance of half a KM. 
It is further incorrect to suggest that I was present on 
my duty in my office on 31.01.2018, i.e date of 
occurrence. It is incorrect to suggest that I have wrongly 
stated I was present on the place occurrence on the date 
of occurrence. I have stated in my statement before the 
police that I was on leave on the day of occurrence. 
Confronted with Ex.DA wherein it is not so mentioned.  
” 
I have also observed that Umar Farooq Shah, SI (PW8) who was the 
investigating officer of this case has admitted it correct that 
Muhammad Sarwar PW was employee of agricultural department. He 
did not produce any certificate of his leave, if any, before him prior to 
registration of F.I.R. 
It is noteworthy that according to the prosecution evidence 
complainant and eyewitnesses shifted Muhammad Munawar in injured 
condition to THQ, Noorpur Thal on a car and that was owned by 
Muhammad Aslam and it was 2D car. The seats of car did not stain 
with blood. He (PW.1) has admitted in his cross-examination that they 
did not try to rap the injury of his son with any piece of cloth, i.e. 
Dhoti, Turban or other types of clothes. Same was the statement of 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW7). Relevant portion of his cross-examination 
reads as under:- 
 
“We did not try to rap any piece of cloth on the injury 
of our injured brother Muhammad Munawar after the 
occurrence. Our clothes were not besmeared with the 
blood while attending Muhammad Munawar in injured 
condition. The seats of the car were also not stained 
with the blood.”  
 
The above mentioned depositions of the eyewitnesses are not 
appealing to a prudent mind because how it is possible that when a 
person will handle any injured person having severe stab wound on  
his body, the clothes of handling person would not be blood stained 
and similarly the seat of car wherein the injured person was shifted 
will not have blood stains, especially in the light of statements of 
eyewitnesses that they had not rap injury of Muhammad Munawar 

Crl. Appl. No. 59174 of 2019 and 
Crl. Rev. No. 59075 of 2019  
7
(since deceased) in injured condition at the place of occurrence. In the 
eventuality of above mentioned circumstances, I am quite confident to 
hold that both the above mentioned PWs were not present at the time 
and place of occurrence and the story of following the deceased by 
eyewitnesses just before the occurrence did not appeal to common 
sense because no reasoning has been given by the above mentioned 
PWs to go behind the deceased. I may refer here the case of “Rohtas 
Khan vs. The State” (2010 SCMR 566) wherein it is held as under:-   
“The story narrated by both the PWs is that they came 
out from the house to inform the deceased to buy some 
more articles does not appeal to common sense as in such 
a situation there was no need for two persons to come out 
from the house. It is usual practice that in such a 
situation always father will direct the son to do the 
needful. Further when they came out from the house the 
deceased was just at 10/15 paces away from them 
therefore they could have called him to inform to buy 
other articles. This was the natural conduct of an elder of 
the house particularly the father but instead thereof they 
were following the deceased and when the deceased 
reached near the mosque the incident took place. It is the 
case of the prosecution that there was a shop near the 
place of incident but the Investigating Officer in his 
statement denied the above fact by admitting that there 
was no shop near the place of occurrence.” 
 
Furthermore, the question of paramount consideration is that if 
such was the state of affairs coupled with the fact as per prosecution’s 
own version the supra mentioned PWs and Muhammad Naeem Ullah 
Awais (jettisoned PW) were coming behind the deceased, then why 
they had not physically intervened and attempted to apprehend the 
appellant especially when he was not armed with any formidable 
weapon. I have noted that Muhammad Iqbal complainant (PW1) has 
admitted in his cross-examination that they had not tried to apprehend 
the accused. Relevant lines of his cross-examination read as under:- 
 
“I, Awais and Muhammad Sarwar did not try to 
apprehend the accused. Volunteered we were at a 
distance of thirty feet from the place of occurrence.” 
 

Crl. Appl. No. 59174 of 2019 and 
Crl. Rev. No. 59075 of 2019  
8
            Under the circumstances, it can be safely held that both the 
above mentioned eye witnesses were neither present at the spot at the 
relevant time nor they had witnessed the occurrence. I may refer here 
the case of “Liaqat Ali Vs. The State” (2008 SCMR 95). Similar view 
was reiterated by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases of 
“Pathan Vs. the State”(2015 SCMR 315), “Zafar Vs. The State and 
others” (2018 SCMR 326) “Shaukat Hussain Vs. The State” (2022 
SCMR 1358) and “Jahangir and another Vs. The State and others” 
(2024 SCMR 1741). 
8. 
Another important aspect of this case which cannot be lost sight 
of is that according to the prosecution story Muhammad Iqbal 
complainant (PW1) and Muhammad Sarwar (PW7) escorted 
Muhammad Munawar in injured condition to the hospital but both the 
above mentioned PWs are not witnesses of identification of deadbody 
in the inquest report (Exh.PE), similarly, if they were present in the 
hospital, why they had not identified the deadbody of Muhammad 
Munawar at the time of his post mortem. This fact has constrained me 
to hold that supra mentioned PWs were not present at the time and 
place of occurrence. Reliance is placed upon the following case laws 
titled as “Abdul Jabbar alias Jabri v. The State” (2017 SCMR 1155) 
and “Nadeem alias Kala v. The State and others” (2018 SCMR 153) 
and “Liaqat Ali and another Vs. The State and others” (2021 SCMR 
780).   
9. 
   Though, the medical evidence which is in the shape of 
statement of Dr. Zain ul Abiden, (PW5), who conducted autopsy on 
the dead body of Muhammad Munawar (deceased) and issued PMR 
(Exh.PC) is available but no other trustworthy direct or indirect 
evidence is available against the appellant, which could be supported 
by the medical evidence. It is by now well settled that medical 
evidence is a type of supporting evidence, which may confirm the 

Crl. Appl. No. 59174 of 2019 and 
Crl. Rev. No. 59075 of 2019  
9
prosecution version with regard to receipt of injury, nature of the 
injury, kind of weapon used in the occurrence but it would not 
identify the assailant. Reference in this context may be made to the 
cases of “Muhammad Hassan & another v. The State & another” 
(2024 SCMR 1427) and “Iftikhar Hussain alias Kharoo v. The State” 
(2024 SCMR 1449).     
10. 
So far as recovery of blood stained knife P-5 at the instance of 
the appellant, vide recovery memo (Exh.PL) from his residential 
house and the positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore  (Exh.PO) are concerned, the same are not helpful to the 
prosecution as  I have noted that the occurrence in this case took place 
on 31.01.2018, whereas, knife P-5 was allegedly recovered on 
23.02.2018 from residential house of appellant. According to the 
statement of Umar Farooq Shah, SI/I.O. (PW8) the appellant was 
arrested on 16.02.2018, i.e. almost 16 days after the occurrence, 
therefore,  preserving the crime weapon in his own house by appellant 
is against the nature, especially once the appellant decided to conceal 
the weapon, as is the case of the prosecution then there was no 
occasion that he would keep the same in such safe custody so as to get 
recover the same at a subsequent point of time and hand over to police 
as a souvenir, therefore, the alleged recovery of knife P-5 is not 
helpful to the prosecution. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case 
of “Basharat and another v. The State” (1995 SCMR 1735) 
disbelieved the evidence of blood-stained knife which was allegedly 
recovered from the house of accused after ten days of the occurrence. 
Relevant part of the said judgment is reproduced hereunder for ready 
reference:-  
 
“ The occurrence took place on 20.04.1988. Basharat 
appellant was arrested on 28.04.1988. The blood-stained 
Chhuri was allegedly recovered from his house on 
30.04.1988. It is not believable that he would have kept 
blood stained chhuri intact in his house for ten days when 

Crl. Appl. No. 59174 of 2019 and 
Crl. Rev. No. 59075 of 2019  
10
he had sufficient time and opportunity to wash away and 
clean the blood on it”  
 
I have noted that the witness of recovery Amir Shahzad 497/C 
(PW9) is a police employee and while effecting the above mentioned 
recovery of knife P-5 Umar Farooq Shah, SI/I.O. (PW8) has not made 
any effort to associate the people of the vicinity. He in his cross-
examination has also conceded this aspect as infra:- 
“I have not associated any Lumberdar or 
Councilor during recovery proceedings of the 
knife allegedly made by the accused. I have also 
not summoned any person from vicinity of the 
place of recovery to witness the recovery 
proceeding of knife.” 
 
In the light of above circumstances, I am of the considered view 
that while effecting the above mentioned recovery the mandatory 
provision of section 103, Cr.P.C. has blatantly been violated. 
Reference in this context may be made to the case of “Muhammad 
Ismail and others vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 898). 
 
 
Now adverting to the positive report of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore (Exh. PO) I have noted that Umar Farooq Shah, 
SI/I.O. (PW8) has not stated in his evidence that knife P-5 was blood 
stained. For the purpose of clarity relevant portion of his examination-
in-chief is described below:-   
 
“On 23.02.2018 Muhammad Dilshad accused 
was interrogated by me in this case and during 
interrogation he made disclosure regarding the 
knife (weapon of offence) (objected by defence 
counsel) and as a result of aforesaid disclosure 
Muhammad Dilshad accused led to the recovery 
of knife from inside the residential room of his 
house from an iron box. Knife P-5 sealed the 
same into parcel and took into possession through 
recovery memo Exh. PL attested by Amir Shahzad 
497/C and Nazakat Ali 348/C. I also prepared 
rough site plan Exh. PM of the place of recovery 
of knife and recorded the statement of attested 
witnesses” 
  

Crl. Appl. No. 59174 of 2019 and 
Crl. Rev. No. 59075 of 2019  
11
In the light of above mentioned circumstances, when this Court has 
already disbelieved the recovery of knife P-5 and Umar Farooq Shah, 
SI/I.O. (PW8) has not stated in his evidence that knife P-5 was blood 
stained then the report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
(Exh. PL) has lost its significance and, in this way inconsequential to 
the prosecution case.   
 
12. 
Now the next piece of evidence which still remains in the field 
is the motive advanced by the prosecution behind the unfortunate 
incident, which, as per prosecution case was that the appellant 
borrowed money from Muhammad Munawar (deceased) and when 
deceased demanded money back the appellant committed the murder 
of Muhammad Munawar son of the complainant. I have noted that 
motive was only an oral assertion of the complainant because no date, 
time and place as well as figure of borrowed money from the deceased 
by the appellant has been described by the PWs. Muhammad Iqbal 
complainant (PW1) has stated in his cross-examination as under:- 
“while lodging the FIR I did not mention the amount of 
the borrowed money as the police said you might depose 
the amount Rs. 50,000.- before the court. ” 
 
Similarly, Muhammad Sarwar (PW7) has stated in his cross-
examination as infra:- 
“I stated about the borrowed amount in my statement 
before the Police. Confronted with Ex.DA wherein it is 
not so recorded. I also stated in my statement before the 
police about the place and time where the transaction of 
the borrowed amount took place. Confronted with Ex.DA 
wherein all these details are not mentioned.  ” 
 
Whereas, Umar Farooq Shah, SI/I.O. (PW8) has stated in his cross-
examination that the complainant did not provide any details of 
money and also did not produce any witness for this outstanding 
amount. No detail regarding time and place for this outstanding 
amount was provided to him. In the light of above mentioned 
circumstances, no material has been produced by the prosecution to 

Crl. Appl. No. 59174 of 2019 and 
Crl. Rev. No. 59075 of 2019  
12
substantiate the motive alleged by the prosecution, hence, I feel no 
hesitation to hold that the prosecution has failed to prove the motive 
part of the unfortunate occurrence. Although, the prosecution is not 
under obligation to establish a motive in every murder case but it is 
also well settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that if prosecution 
sets up a motive but fails to prove it, then, it is the prosecution who 
has to suffer and not the accused. Reliance is placed upon the cases 
titled as “Tajamal Hussain Shah Vs. The State and another” (2022 
SCMR 1567), “Amir Muhammad Khan vs. The State” (2023 SCMR 
566) , Sarfraz and another vs. The State (2023 SCMR 670) 
and“Maqsood Alam and another v. The State and others” (2024 
SCMR 156). 
 
13. 
 After analyzing the prosecution case from every angle, I have 
concluded that the case against the appellant is replete with doubts and 
his conviction and sentence cannot be upheld on the basis of such 
shaky and untrustworthy evidence. The Apex Court of the country time 
and again held that in the event of a doubt, the benefit must be given to 
the accused not as a matter of grace, but as a matter of right. Reliance 
is placed upon the following case laws titled as “Muhammad Riaz vs. 
Khurram Shahzad and another” (2024 SCMR 51) “Muhammad 
Nawaz  & another v. The State and others” (2024 SCMR 1731) and 
“Rehmat Ullah & 2 others v. The State & others” (2024 SCMR 
1782).   
 
14. 
For the foregoing reasons, Criminal Appeal No.59174-J of 
2019 is accepted and Muhammad Dilshad, appellant is acquitted of 
the charge by extending benefit of doubt to him. Muhammad Dilshad 
appellant is in jail; he be released forthwith if not required in any 
other case. 

Crl. Appl. No. 59174 of 2019 and

15. 
After accepting the appeal of respondent No. 1 and setting aside 
the impugned judgment this Criminal Revision No. 59075 of 2019 for 
enhancement of sentence is dismissed.
