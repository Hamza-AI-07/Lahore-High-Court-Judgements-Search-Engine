Petitioner by 
Mr. Imtiaz Hussain Khan Baloch, 
Advocate 
 
Respondent by 
Mr. Haider Ali Khan, Advocate  
 
 
             Rasaal Hasan Syed, J.  Petitioner in this civil 
revision has challenged judgments and decree dated 
12.10.2018 and 11.6.2020 of the courts below in terms 
whereof the suit for specific performance of the petitioner 
was dismissed and return of earnest money of Rs. 50,000/- 
was allowed which judgment was affirmed in appeal. 
2. 
Petitioner/plaintiff instituted a suit for specific 
performance to enforce sale agreement dated 01.2.2008 in 
respect of land measuring 10 marlas at Chak No.63/MB 
Tehsil and District Khushab, claiming that in terms of the 
agreement the land was contracted to be sold in favour of the 
petitioner for Rs.2,50,000/-; a sum of Rs.50,000/- was 
claimed to have been paid as earnest money; another amount 
of Rs.50,000/- was paid by the petitioner on 10.2.2008; the

respondent did not transfer the land in favour of the petitioner 
and that the petitioner was entitled to the enforcement of sale 
agreement through the indulgence of court. In response 
respondent did not deny the execution of agreement but 
claimed that in terms of agreement the balance amount of 
Rs.2,00,000/- was to be paid till 01.5.2008 which 
commitment having not been fulfilled the earnest money 
stood forfeited and the agreement stood terminated of which a 
notice was also sent to the petitioner and that the suit was 
barred by time having been filed after more than five years. 
Parties’ evidence was recorded whereafter the learned Civil 
Judge dismissed the suit vide judgment dated 12.10.2018 with 
the findings that the suit was barred by time, the plea of 
additional payment of Rs.50,000/- could not be proved; the 
petitioner could not prove his readiness and willingness to 
perform his part of obligation and that despite rescission of 
agreement the suit was filed after more than five years from 
the date fixed in the agreement dated 01.2.2008. The suit to 
the extent of relief of specific performance was declined 
while the respondent was directed to refund Rs.50,000/- being 
received as earnest money. Parties filed separate appeals i.e. 
civil appeal No.373 of 2019 titled Muhammad Alam v. 
Darbari Khan and civil appeal No.374 of 2019 titled Darbari 
Khan v. Muhammad Alam before the District Judge, 
Khushab. The petitioner’s appeal was against the dismissal of 
suit for specific performance while the respondent’s appeal 
was to the extent of direction to refund earnest money. Both

Page-3 
 
 
 
the appeals were dismissed by learned Addl. District Judge, 
Khushab vide judgment dated 11.6.2020. In the instant 
revision petition the petitioner/plaintiff has challenged the 
judgments and decree of the courts below whereby the suit to 
the extent of relief of specific performance of agreement was 
concurrently dismissed.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the 
courts below did not consider the documents in proper 
perspective; the evidence produced by the petitioner was 
either ignored or misread; payment of additional amount of 
Rs.50,000/- was proved on record which fact was incorrectly 
decided against the petitioner; the petitioner had proved his 
readiness and willingness to seek a decree for specific 
performance and that the discretion was not exercised in 
accordance with law. In response learned counsel for the 
respondent supported the findings of the courts below. 
4. 
Points raised in the course of hearing have been given 
due consideration in the light of the evidence on record and 
the findings recorded by the courts below. The agreement to 
sell was admittedly executed on 01.2.2008 wherein the 
consideration was fixed as Rs.2,50,000/- out of which a sum 
of Rs.50,000/- was paid as earnest money and this fact was 
acknowledged in the agreement itself. In terms of the 
agreement the balance sale consideration was payable till 
01.5.2008. It was stipulated that in case of failure to make 
payment the agreement would stand rescinded and earnest 
money will be liable to forfeiture. Petitioner’s claim was that 

        C.R. No.40284 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-4 
 
 
 
he was willing to perform his part but on account of 
respondent’s failure to perform the obligations as per 
agreement, the same could not be effected while the 
respondent’s stance was that the petitioner never made the 
payment of balance consideration and the agreement was 
rescinded after the expiry of the cut-off date of which a notice 
was sent to the petitioner but despite that the suit was 
instituted after expiry of limitation. Both the courts below 
have concluded that the suit was barred by time. Original 
agreement of sale was not produced nor any permission to 
adduce secondary evidence was ever solicited from the courts 
instead copy of the agreement Mark-A was produced which 
was placed on record. The courts below after observing that 
the original document was not produced considered the copy 
thereof for the reason that the existence of agreement was not 
in issue. As per conditions of the agreement payment of 
balance amount of consideration i.e. Rs.2,00,000/- was to 
made till 01.5.2008, to conclude the sale.  Limitation to file a 
suit for specific performance of sale agreement is regulated 
by Article 113 of Limitation Act, 1908 which provides that if 
a date is fixed for the performance, the suit could be instituted 
within three years from the date so fixed and if no such date 
is fixed the suit could be filed when the vendee has noticed 
that the performance has been refused. The suit of the 
petitioner falls in the first part of Article 113 ibid. as in the 
agreement Mark-A itself the parties had fixed date for the 
payment of balance consideration and completion of sale till 

        C.R. No.40284 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-5 
 
 
 
01.5.2008. This fact was also admitted by the petitioner in his 
statement as P.W.1 wherein in cross-examination he stated 
that it is correct that the agreement was executed on 
01.2.2008 and that the suit was instituted on 17.12.2013. It  
was also admitted that in the agreement it was stipulated that 
balance amount of Rs.2,00,000/- was payable till 01.5.2008 
and in case of non-payment the agreement would stand 
rescinded and earnest money would be liable to be forfeited. 
In view of the admission made in the statement of P.W.1, the 
plaintiff that agreement provided for a date of terminus a quo, 
under Article 113 ibid. suit could be instituted only within 
three years from the date which the parties had agreed for the 
completion of the deal.  In this case the agreement is dated 
01.2.2008 while the suit was filed on 17.12.2013 i.e. after 
more than five years and seven months from the date fixed in 
the agreement for payment of balance consideration which 
was obviously barred by time and it was rightly so concluded 
by the courts below to be so which findings do not suffer 
from any error of law or from any misreading of record.   
5. 
As far as the relief of specific performance is 
concerned which is discretionary in its nature, the petitioner 
was expected to prove that he was ready and willing to 
perform his part of agreement from the date of its execution 
till the date fixed for payment of balance sale consideration; 
and also to prove that he did take steps necessary for the 
performance of his part. In the instant case the findings are 
that the petitioner could not perform his part of agreement. In 

        C.R. No.40284 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-6 
 
 
 
terms of the sale agreement dated 01.2.2008 the petitioner 
admittedly had to pay the balance consideration of 
Rs.2,00,000/- till 01.5.2008, which was not proved to have 
been offered/tendered or paid. It was asserted by petitioner 
that after the sale agreement another sum of Rs.50,000/- was 
paid  to the respondent on 10.2.2008 but no receipt or any 
acknowledgement could be produced on record. The 
statement of the witness in this context being unworthy of any 
credence was rightly disbelieved by the courts below. The 
pleadings and the evidence show that the petitioner never 
approached the respondent to tender balance amount of 
consideration nor served any notice for performance of 
agreement upon the respondent till 01.5.2008 or thereafter till 
the institution of the suit on 17.12.2013. The cut-off date for 
the payment of balance consideration was 01.5.2008 but the 
evidence does not indicate that the petitioner ever called upon 
the respondent to receive the balance consideration amount. 
Strangely enough the suit was filed on 17.12.2013 after five 
years and nine months from the date of agreement i.e., 
01.2.2008. It was dismissed on 12.10.2018 while first appeal 
thereagainst was dismissed on 11.6.2020; but neither at the 
time of institution of suit nor throughout its pendency the 
petitioner ever attempted to deposit the balance sale price. 
Even till the decision of the appeal on 11.6.2020 the 
petitioner never attempted to tender/deposit the balance sale 
price to show his bona fide. Being so, it was not a case in 

        C.R. No.40284 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-7 
 
 
 
which the petitioner was entitled to any relief in equitable 
jurisdiction. 
6. 
It is manifest from the facts noted supra that the 
petitioner could not prove having ever paid or tendered for 
payment the balance amount of consideration nor produced 
any documentary evidence such as cheque, pay order, for 
payment of balance consideration. So much so after the filing 
of suit till the filing of appeal no attempt was made to deposit 
the balance sale price. It was, therefore, a case in which the 
discretionary jurisdiction could not be exercised in his favour 
and was rightly declined by the courts below. Reference can 
be made to the case of “Nazar Hussain and another v. Syed 
Iqbal Ahmad Qadri (Deceased) through his L.Rs. and 
another” (2022 SCMR 1216) where it was observed to the 
effect that a buyer’s primary obligation in a contract of sale is 
to make payment of the balance sale consideration as 
stipulated in the contract and that if the seller refuses to 
receive payment the buyer must establish that he had the 
required money which was kept aside for the seller, for 
instance, by making a pay order or cashier cheque in his name 
as this would show that the buyer no longer had access to the 
sale consideration and that alternatively the buyer could have 
deposited it in court. In that case the petitioners had done 
neither. It was further observed to the effect that if a buyer 
does not fulfill its primary obligations to secure/tender the 
sale consideration and files suit and does so without 
depositing the sale consideration in court, the seller is placed 

        C.R. No.40284 of 2020  
 
 
 
 
Page-8 
 
 
 
in an advantageous position. In that case the agreement was 
dated 17.3.2004 whereas the suit was filed on 17.3.2007 and 
that in 2022 after eighteen years, it would be eminently unfair 
if the petitioners, the purported buyers were permitted to pay 
the same amount to the seller.  
7. 
The courts below, in the instant case, after considering 
all these material facts rightly concluded that the petitioner 
was not entitled to seek specific performance of the 
agreement which was executed on 01.2.2008. The findings 
recorded by them do not suffer from any error of law, 
misreading and non-reading of evidence or any jurisdictional 
defect as to call for interference.  
8. 
Resultantly, this revision petition is without substance 
which is, accordingly, is dismissed.
