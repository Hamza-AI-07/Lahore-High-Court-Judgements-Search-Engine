The prosecution story, as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex.PA/1) lodged on 
the complaint (Ex. PA) of Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, S.I/S.H.O, (PW-35), is 
that on 21.07.2012 at about 02:00 p.m, he (PW-35) along with Saifullah, 
Muhammad Naveed constables and Mehboob Hussain Shah constable (PW-3) 
was present in Police Station ANF, R.D, Rawalpindi, where Syed Mehboob 
Hussain 
Shah/H.C 
(PW-3) 
handed 
over 
a 
letter 
bearing 

Crl. Appeal No.663 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.684 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.685 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.834 of 2018

No.3(44)ANF/IR/LAW/2011 dated 20th July 2012 (Ex. PB) issued by Lieutenant 
Colonel Touqeer Abbas Zaidi, Joint Director ANF, R.D, Rawalpindi (given up 
PW), to him (PW-35). As per the letter above (Ex. PB), during the investigation 
of case FIR No.40/2011, it transpired that in the year 2010, the Ministry of 
Health, 
Islamabad, 
issued 
Ephedrine 
quota 
to 
some 
Pharmaceutical/Firms/Companies by bypassing the routine procedure and 
accorded excess of the prescribed limit to such companies who did not receive 
and utilized Ephedrine quota earlier. Ministry of Health collected records of 99 
companies, including 28 Pharmaceutical companies, which previously did not 
obtain Ephedrine; neither they were allocated nor used the same. After that, the 
inquiry revealed that Grays Pharmaceutical, located at Industrial Area, Rawat, 
Islamabad, was allotted a 500-kilogram Ephedrine quota. After that, they did not 
use it legally nor prepare the required medicine; instead, only samples of 
medicine and forged sale record was prepared, prima facie, and the rest of the 
Ephedrine was sold out to narcotics smugglers and gained illegal money; the 
administration of the pharmaceutical company was required to use Ephedrine 
according to instructions of the Health Ministry and to keep a complete record 
of the sale and purchase of medicine. Still, the company administration failed to 
submit a satisfactory report. The administration of the pharmaceutical company 
and owner of the company, namely Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, Bakhtawari, etc., 
were found involved in the illegal use of Ephedrine. Based on the above-said 
letter (Ex. PB), Shahzad Ali Kawish A.D (not cited as a witness) directed Syed 
Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35), to register the case and to investigate 
the same. After that, a complaint (Ex. PA) was prepared, based on which formal 
FIR No.41 of 2012 (Ex. PA/1), dated 21.07.2012, under sections 9(c), 14 & 15 
of CNSA, 1997 at Police Station ANF, R.D, North Rawalpindi was chalked out 
by Arshad Mehmood/H.C (PW-1). Copy of FIR (Ex. PA/1) was referred to

Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, and his co-accused, Ghazanfar Ali (since acquitted), 
Rana Mohsan Khursheed (since acquitted), Nasir Khan (since acquitted), 
Nazakat Khan (since acquitted), Basit Abbasi (since acquitted), Ahmed Bilal 
Aadil (since acquitted) and Siraj Ahmad Abbasi (since acquitted), on 
29.10.2014, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The charge was 
framed in two heads, which are as follows: - 
“That for the year of 2010 you accused Muhammad Hanif 
Abbasi proprietor of Gray’s Pharmaceutical Industrial 
Area Rawat, available 500 Kilograms Ephedrine, a 
controlled substance quota, for your firm Gray”s 
Pharmaceutical, Industrial Area Rawat. You did not 
possess and used it for industrial purposes in the manner 
specified 
under 
Control 
of 
Narcotic 
Substances 
(Regulation of Drugs of Abuse, Controlled Chemicals, 
Equipment and Materials) Rules 2001, rather you sold, 
distributed, delivered, transported and smuggled that 
ephedrine. Hence you contravened the provision of section

6 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act 1997 and 
committed offence punishable under section 9 (c) of the 
Control of Narcotic Substances Act 1997.  
That you accused Ghazanfar Ali, Rana Mohsan Nasir 
Khan, Nazakat Khan, Basit Abbasi, Ahmed Bilal Aadil and 
Siraj Ahmad Abbasi participated in, associated, abetted, 
facilitated your co-accused Muhammad Hanif Abbasi in 
misuse, smuggling and non-compliance of Control of 
Narcotic Substances (Regulation of Drugs of Abuse, 
Controlled Chemicals Equipment and Materials) Rules 
2001. Hence you all accused also committed offences 
punishable under section 9 (c) and section 16 of the 
Control of Narcotic Substances Act 1997. The offences are 
within the cognizance of this Court and I hereby direct all 
of you be tried by this Court for the above said offences.” 
6. 
 
To advance its case, the prosecution produced as many as thirty-six 
(36) witnesses. Learned SPP gave up PWs-Dr. Abdul Rasheed, Lieutenant 
Colonel Syed Touqeer Abbas Zaidi, Nisar Ahmed, Security Guard Mehran 
Clinic Sindhi Muslim Society Karachi, and Muhammad Waseem constable as 
being unnecessary and closed the prosecution evidence.  
7. 
 
The appellant was also examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C., 
wherein he neither opted to appear as his own witness in terms of Section 340(2) 
Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce any defence evidence. While replying to a 
particular question that why the PWs had deposed against him, the appellant, 
Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, made the following deposition: - 
“I am a well-reputed & seasoned politician of 
Rawalpindi Division and have twice been elected as 
Member National Assembly. In 2003’s Bi-Election of 
NA-56, I was elected as Member National Assembly by 
defeating candidate of the ruling party of that regime 
i.e., the real nephew of Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, the then 
Federal Minister. Thereafter, in General Elections of 
2008, I was also returned as Member National 
Assembly after defeating Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, 
candidate of PML(Q). My political rivals never 
reconciled with these defeats & bent backwards and 
by using their political influence with the connivance 
of ANF, they designed a plan to drag me in some false

cases to damage my reputation & political career, 
thereafter they hired the services of ANF as a tool and 
managed to get registered the instant false case against 
me, employees of Gray’s Pharmaceutical & its 
authorized distributors. Besides that it is also clear 
from record that ANF has absolutely no jurisdiction to 
take cognizance in a matter which does not fall within 
the ambit of CNSA, 1997 and this fact is further 
proved on record that they Ministry of Narcotics 
Control issued SRO 282(1)/2012 dated 21.03.2012 and 
further 
clarified 
the 
position 
by 
issuing 
Notifications/Letters No.F.No.11-4/95-Policy-I dated 
28th March, 2012 & No.MNC U.O. No.9-9/10-Policy-I 
dated 3rd April, 2012 Ex-DN, Ex-DO & Ex.DP 
respectively. This was the reason that earlier this 
Honourable Court in two other cases of similar nature 
i.e. case FIR No.45/2012 & No.53/2012, acquitted the 
accused persons on 15.05.2014 while exercising power 
u/s 265-K Cr.P.C. Attested copies of the applications 
& judgments dated 15.05.2014 are produced as Ex.DJ 
& DK. In addition to that, it is also proved on record 
that allocation of quota of Ephedrine to Gray’s 
Pharmaceutical was duly utilized and the company in 
different batches manufactures 1 crore, 65 lac, 86 
thousand De-Asm tablets having 30 mg Ephedrine 
HCI each tablet (total 16586 jars containing 1000 
tablets each) and supplied the same to its three 
Authorized Distributors, detail of which was also 
proved as: 
Above 11000 jars to Arafat Traders Karachi, whereas 
3000 jars to Hammas Pharma Rawalpindi and  
2000 jars to AB Pharma Rawalpindi. 
The authorized dealers further sold medicine with the 
following breakup: 
Above 6000 jars were sold by Arafat Traders, whereas 
4876 jars were returned to Company. 
2882 jars were sold by Hammas Pharma, whereas 
118 jars were returned to company. 
1909 jars were sold by AB Pharma, whereas 
91 jars were returned to Company

It is also established on record that the competent 
authority i.e. Ministry of Health qua matters related to 
controlled chemicals is neither complainant of the 
instant case nor any official of Ministry is witness or 
accused in the case. In fact, the instant case is a 
textbook example of colorable exercise of jurisdiction 
on the part of ANF with connivance of my political 
rivals. I am innocent and have been dragged in a false 
& frivolous case purely on political considerations.”  
8. 
 
After hearing the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for 
the appellant as well as the learned SPP, the learned trial court, while evaluating 
the evidence available on record, found the version of the prosecution as correct 
beyond any shadow of doubt, which resulted into the conviction of the 
appellant-Muhammad Hanif Abbasi in the above-stated terms. 
9. 
 
We have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for 
the appellants and the learned Special Prosecutor for ANF and have minutely 
perused the record. 
10. 
 
As per the prosecution case, on 21.07.2012, at 02:00 p.m., Syed 
Imtiaz Hussain Shah, S.I/S.H.O, (PW-35)-the complainant-investigating officer 
based on a letter bearing No.3(44)ANF/IR/LAW/2011 dated 20th July 2012 (Ex. 
PB) issued by Lieutenant Colonel Touqeer Abbas Zaidi, Joint Director ANF, 
R.D, Rawalpindi (given up PW) prepared complaint (Ex. PA), to which formal 
FIR No.41/2012 (Ex.PA/1), was registered on 21.07.2012 under sections 9(c), 
14 & 15 of CNSA, 1997 at Police Station ANF, R.D, North Rawalpindi. Before 
we proceed to discuss the prosecution evidence, it would be appropriate to 
mention here that the prosecution started against the appellant-Muhammad 
Hanif Abbasi, and his co-accused after an inquiry conducted by Abid Zulfiqar, 
Joint Director (PW-33) (then Deputy Director ANF Rawalpindi). The inquiry 
proceedings were initiated against the appellant-Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, and 
his co-accused without complaint. This fact has been admitted by Syed Imtiaz 
Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer, during cross-
examination and he (PW-35) deposed that: -

“No complaint was ever sent by the Ministry of 
narcotic control and ANF to the Ministry of Health 
regarding alleged misuse of quota of Ephedrine by 
Grays Pharmaceutical Company. Again, said it is not 
in 
my 
knowledge; 
however, 
an 
inquiry was 
convened.” 
 
 
Abid Zulfiqar, JD (PW-33), deposed during his examination-in-
chief that he, handed over the record of Grays Pharmaceutical company to Syed 
Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating office. The following 
documents were handed over by Abid Zulfiqar, JD (PW-33), to Syed Imtiaz 
Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer: 
1. The inquiry report (Ex. PBB) along with the 
complete file consisting of 75 pages (P-1 to P-75) of 
United Plastic Jars Supplier (Ex. P-EE); that of the 
file consisting of 58 pages (P-1 to P-58) of A.B 
Pharma Distributor (Ex. P-FF);  
2. That of the invoices file consisting of 09 pages (P-1 
to P-9) A.B Pharma (Ex. P-GG) along with the 
statement consisting of 56 pages (P-1 to P-56) of 
Hammas Pharma Distributor (Ex. P-HH);  
3. That of the distribution file consisting of 144 pages 
(P-1 to P-144) of Hammas Pharma Distributor (Ex.

P-13) of Hammas Pharma (Ex. P-JJ);  
4. That of the marketing file of Arfat Traders along 
with invoices consisting of 17 pages (P-1 to P-17) 
issued by Grays Pharma (Ex. P-KK) and

Undisputedly, the complaint (Ex. PA) was prepared based on an 
inquiry conducted by Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director, ANF (PW-33) (then Deputy 
Director ANF Rawalpindi). Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director, ANF (PW-33), 
deposed that on 20.07.2012, he conducted an inquiry about the illegal use of 
Ephedrine. He summoned records, sale/purchase records, distribution records, 
and procurement records of Grays Pharmaceutical Company. Abid Zulfiqar 
(PW-33) admitted during cross-examination that: - 
“I have not mentioned about any direction of superior 
officer or any reference number or any date, in 
pursuance of which I carried out inquiry Ex-PBB. 
Volunteer that it was verbal direction of Lieutenant 
Colonel Touqeer Abbas Zaidi and Force Commander 
Brigadier Faheem. --------------------- I have not 
mentioned about any verbal direction in my inquiry 
proceedings. I have not mentioned about any report 
and date on the basis of which, I have initiated 
inquiry proceedings Ex-PBB. I have not mentioned 
any date of start of inquiry in inquiry report Ex-PBB, 
except date of preparation 20-07-2012. Ex-PB and Ex-
PBB are of same date i.e. 20-07-2012. There is no 
report or order of any superior officer prior to 20-07-
2012 on whole file, through which it was directed to 
initiate any inquiry or proceedings against Grays 
Pharmaceutical.”  
 
 
Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33) initiated the inquiry based on 
verbal directions, a reference of which was not given in the inquiry report (Ex. 
PD). Learned counsel for the appellant-Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, categorically 
submitted that there is no concept of conducting an inquiry on receiving 
information disclosing cognizable offence before registration of the criminal 
case under Section 154 Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (for short Cr.P.C.), and 
the documents handed over by Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33) to Syed 
Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer were not got 
verified by the investigating officer (PW-35) so these documents lost their 
evidentiary value.

At this stage, we are concerned with interpreting the procedural 
law, particularly relating to the investigation and the effect of crime. Needless to 
say, the registration of the “First Information Report” (for short, “FIR”), 
investigation, and adjudication process of offences are the main dimension of 
the administration of the criminal justice delivery system. The criminal 
procedure is supplemental to substantive criminal law. Its failure would 
seriously affect the substantive criminal law, substantially affecting the 
protection it gives society. The criminal procedure provided that if any 
information disclosing a cognizable offence is laid before an officer-in-charge of 
a police station satisfying the requirements of Section 154 of Cr.P.C., the said 
police officer has no other option except to enter the substance thereof in the 
prescribed form, that is to say, to register a case based on such information. By 
its very definition, a cognizable offence would be a serious offence. A 
cognizable offence would be where the Investigating Officer can arrest the 
accused without a warrant. Section 154 of Cr.P.C. specifies that when a person 
commits any cognizable offense could be arrested without an order from the 
Magistrate and without a warrant. Section 157 of Cr.P.C. has significance in the 
Criminal Procedure Code. The officer in charge of a police station is statutorily 
obliged to register a case and then to proceed with the investigation if he has 
reason to suspect the commission of an offence which he is empowered under 
Section 156 of the Code to investigate, subject to the proviso to Section 157 of 
Cr.P.C. The only condition precedent for putting the machinery of investigation 
in motion under Section 154 of Cr.P.C. is information of a cognizable offence 
and registration of a criminal case for the offence alleged to have been 
committed, which is cognizable. The investigation includes all proceedings 
under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, for collecting evidence by a police 
officer. There is no specific provision where pre-investigative inquiry is either 
expressly permitted. Except under Section 174 Cr.P.C. as regards unnatural 
deaths and other cases reported to the police. The officer-in-charge of a police 
station is legally bound to register a first information report in terms of Section 
154 of Cr.P.C. if the allegations made therein give rise to an offence that can be

& Crl. Appeal No.747 of 2018 
 
 
 
18
investigated without obtaining any permission from the magistrate concerned. 
Thus, the investigating officer would investigate the offence relating to 
committing a cognizable offence. If the offence is non-cognizable, the 
investigating officer has no jurisdiction to take any further steps regarding the 
investigation without the leave of the Court by the provisions of Section 155 (2) 
of the Code. It is only in cases where the cognizable offence is not disclosed or 
the authenticity of which ex-facie is highly doubtful. There is a need to conduct 
a further inquiry to ascertain whether the cognizable offence is made out or not, 
the police officer can conduct a preliminary inquiry and not in all cases but only 
upon making the entry in the Daily Diary/Roznamacha instantaneously with 
reasons and the need for adopting such a course of action. Such inquiry should 
be completed expeditiously and, in any case, not later than one day. After that, 
the FIR should be recorded in the prescribed register, and the officer should take 
any other recourse permissible to him strictly by the provisions of the Criminal 
Procedure Code under which he is empowered to investigate.  
12. 
 
The registration of the FIR initiates every criminal trial. But in the 
instant case before the registration of FIR, the inquiry was conducted by Abid 
Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33), before registration of FIR. During the inquiry 
process, Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33), collected the records of Grays 
Pharmaceutical Company, Arfat Traders, A.B. Pharmaceutical, and Hammas 
Pharmaceutical companies. Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33), instructed 
different officials to collect the documents, prepare samples, and refer the same 
to the testing laboratories without authority. He (PW-33) admitted during cross-
examination that: - 
“Collection of evidence is exclusive prerogative of 
investigating officer during investigation. I never 
remained investigation officer of case FIR No.41 
(instant case) from 21-07-2012 onwards. I was 
investigating officer of case FIR No.40 dated 10-10-
2011. I have collected evidence in said case being 
investigating officer. Case FIR No.40 of 2011 was 
registered in PS ANF Committee Chowk Rawalpindi

19
and case FIR No.41 of 2012 (instant case) was 
registered in PS ANF RD Rawalpindi. My status in 
this case is of a prosecution witness.” 
 
 
Per the prosecution case, the ephedrine quota was sanctioned 
against the prescribed limit and procedure. Whereas, Abid Zulfiqar, Joint 
Director (PW-33), admitted during cross-examination that: - 
“During investigation of case FIR No.40 of 2011, it 
came in my knowledge that legal quota of allotment of 
Ephedrine is 500 kgs, volunteer that as per rules of 
Ministry of Health maximum limit of allotment of 
quota of Ephedrine is 500 kgs per annum. -------------- 
It is correct that the 500 kgs quota of Ephedrine 
allotted to Grays Pharmaceutical Company was 
strictly in accordance with rules and regulations of 
Ministry of Health.” 
 
 
The admission of Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33), reveals 
that the quota of Ephedrine allotted to Grays Pharmaceutical Company was 
strictly by the rules and regulations of the Ministry of Health and appellant-
Muhammad Hanif Abbasi had not used his position for sanction of the quota of 
Ephedrine. Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33), further admitted during cross-
examination that: - 
“I have seen letter of permission for purchase of 
Ephedrine to Grays Pharmaceutical Company dated 
30-06-2010 issued by Ministry of Health. ANF 
department performs its jobs under Ministry of 
Narcotics Control. It is correct that as per serial No-2, 
copy of this letter is sent to DG ANF Rawalpindi and 
at serial No-3 to section officer (Policy) Ministry of 
Narcotics Control Islamabad. Volunteer that initially 
there is an allocation of quota and then permission is 
granted to purchase Ephedrine, copy of which is sent 
for information to ANF.” 
 
 
Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating 
officer deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“It is correct that no specific limit of Ephedrine quota 
was demanded by the applicant, however the

20
competent authority allotted the quota of Ephedrine 
on a separate application of Grays Pharmaceutical 
Company only keeping in view the specification of De-
ASM tablet without any specific demand. It is correct 
that the standard quota of Ephedrine is 500 Kgs. It is 
correct that the quota of Ephedrine was allocated 
with permission to purchase the same by Ministry of 
Health through same order dated 30-06-2010. It is 
correct that the Ephedrine was purchased by the 
Grays 
Pharmaceutical 
Company 
from 
Alpha 
Chemical in different 11 phases during the period of 
06 months.” 
 
 
The deposition of Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-
the investigating officer, reveals that the standard quota of Ephedrine is 500 
Kgs. Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33), further admitted during cross-
examination that: - 
“It is correct that 500 Kgs quota of Ephedrine allotted 
to Grays Pharmaceutical Company was strictly in 
accordance with rules and regulation of Ministry of 
Health.” 
Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33) deposed during cross-examination that: -  
“There is no direction of any court including August 
Supreme 
Court 
of 
Pakistan 
with 
regard 
to 
registration of case against Grays Pharmaceutical and 
Muhammad Haneef Abbasi.” 
 
 
From the depositions of Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33), and 
Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer, it 
reveals that the quota of Ephedrine 500 Kgs was lawfully allotted to the 
appellant-Muhammad Hanif Abbasi. The prosecution failed to bring on the 
record any material evidence showing that the appellant-Muhammad Hanif 
Abbasi got Ephedrine over the prescribed limit.  
13. 
 
As per the prosecution case, preparing the fake and fabricated 
invoices of the De-Asm tablets is concerned. The prosecution evidence reveals 
that during inquiry proceedings, records of Grays Pharmaceutical Company,

21
Arfat Traders, A.B. Pharmaceutical, and Hammas Pharmaceutical companies 
were summoned, and the records were received by Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director 
(PW-33). As per the prosecution evidence, Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-
33), handed over these documents to Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-
35)-the investigating officer. Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the 
investigating officer deposed during cross-examination that: - 
 “On 19-09-2013 I affected the arrest of Muhammad 
Basit Abbasi and Ahmed Bilal Aadil on rejection of 
their bail from the Hon’able Lahore High Court 
Lahore, Rawalpindi Bench. I obtained the accused on 
physical remand. During the course of investigation, I 
interrogated about recording the invoices issued by 
the Grays Pharma company in the name of AB 
Pharma Distributor College Road, Rawalpindi; I 
joined the shopkeepers in the investigation to verify 
the invoices allegedly issued by the AB Pharma 
Distributor to them on 30.09.2010, 02.10.2010, 
05.10.2010, 07.10.2010 and 09.10.2010.  
 
 
Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer 
had concealed the facts from the court. The testimony of Abid Zulfiqar, Joint 
Director (PW-33), reveals that he produced documents/records of Grays 
Pharmaceutical Company, Arfat Traders, A.B. Pharmaceutical, and Hammas 
Pharmaceutical companies before Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the 
investigating officer, i.e., a file consisting of 58 pages of A.B Pharma 
Distributor (Ex. PFF/P-1 to P-58), that of invoices file consisting of 09 pages 
A.B Pharma (Ex. PGG/P-1 to P-9), that of marketing file consisting of 56 pages 
along with the statement of Hammas Pharma Distributor (Ex. PHH/P-1 to P-56), 
that of distribution file consisting of 144 pages of Hammas Pharma Distributor 
(Ex. PII/ P-1 to P-144), that of invoices file consisting of 13 pages of Hammas 
Pharma (Ex. PJJ/ P-1 to P-13), that of the marketing file of Arfat Traders along 
with invoices consisting of 17-pages issued by Grays Pharma (Ex. PKK/ P-1 to 
P-17), that of statements of employees of Grays Pharma consisting of 21 pages  
(Ex. PLL/P-1 to P-21), which were secured by him (PW-35). The prosecution 
failed to prove in whose presence and when the above-said documents were

summoned by him and in whose presence, when, and where he secured the 
same. From the testimony of Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the 
investigating officer, it reveals that constable Mehboob Hussain Shah (PW-3) 
was the witness to the effect that Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33), handed 
over the documents mentioned above to Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-
35)-the investigating officer. The prosecution must establish by convincing 
evidence that the abovementioned record was kept in safe custody and not 
tampered with. All these circumstances taken together only deepen the shadows 
of doubt cast upon the case of prosecution. The Statement of Ahmad Bilal Adil 
(Ex. PFF/1/58) reveals that said statement was tempered with and Batch Nos. 
were later written with different pen/ink/and writing. A scanned copy of the 
statements of Ahmad Bilal Adil (Ex. PFF/1/58) and Nisar Ahmad Qureshi (Ex. 
PHH/1/30) are being pasted hereunder for ready reference: -

In the above-said statement (Ex. PFF/1/1-58), under the head, “Grays” in batch 
numbers are mentioned with different handwriting and ink. The statement of 
Nisar Ahmad Qureshi (Ex. PHH/1/30) reveals that at the end of the statement 
and before the signature of Nisar Ahmad Qureshi, one line was added with

Similarly, in the statements of Muhammad Ishaq (Ex. PHH/1/43) 
and Muhammad Mazher Kayyani (Ex. PHH/1/47), Batch Nos. were added. We 
also conclude that in the statements of Ahmad Bilal Adil (Ex. PFF/1/58), Nisar 
Ahmad Qureshi (Ex. PHH/1/30), Muhammad Ishaq (Ex. PHH/1/43), and 
Muhammad Mazher Kayyani (Ex. PHH/1/47), there is interpolation/overwriting. 
We are of the considered view that the discrepancies/overwriting/interpolations, 
as observed by us, cast serious doubt on the genuineness of the statements of 
Ahmad Bilal Adil (Ex. PFF/1/58), Nisar Ahmad Qureshi (Ex. PHH/1/30),

Muhammad Ishaq (Ex. PHH/1/43) and Muhammad Mazher Kayyani (Ex. 
PHH/1/47). Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating 
officer deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
 I verified the batch manufacturing record i.e., Batch 
No.X-086 which was found fake and fabricated as the 
medicine was manufactured on 16.10.2010 according 
to Batch manufacturing record whereas, the sale was 
shown with effect from 30.09.2010 to 09.10.2010, 
which proved that all the record was fictitiously 
maneuvered.  
 
 
We observed that the statement of Ahmad Bilal Adil (Ex. 
PFF/1/58) had been interpolated regarding Batch Nos. of De-ASM. If 
interpolation/overwriting is excluded from the rest of the statement, the 
statement of Ahmad Bilal Adil (Ex. PFF/1/58) nowhere speaks of the invoices 
being related to Batch No. X086 is to be a case of fake preparation of documents 
holding the appellant-Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, liable under the Control of 
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, and the same cast serious doubt on the 
genuineness of the prosecution case.  
14. 
 
The 
invoices 
(Ex.PHH/1/4, 
Ex.PHH/1/5, 
Ex.PHH/1/7, 
Ex.PHH/1/8, Ex.PHH/1/9) were not signed or stamped by anyone on behalf of 
Gray’s Pharmaceuticals except one invoice dated 13.10.2010 (Ex. PHH/ 1/6). 
From the perusal of Gray’s Pharmaceuticals Quality Control Department, the 
finished product analysis report (Ex. PJQ 1/11) reveals that Batch No. X086 
was manufactured on 10.10.10, and its expiry was 10/10/2012. Admittedly, the 
invoices produced by Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33), before the 
investigating officer (PW-35) were not verified. Without verification of the 
invoices, he (PW-35) stated that said documents were forged and fictitious. In 
this regard, Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating 
officer deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I took into possession the Batch manufacturing 
record provided by the Grays Pharmaceutical

Company but did not got verified from any 
Government Laboratory.” 
 
 
It is necessary to add here that defence put objections on all these 
documents in the testimony of Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33), and Syed 
Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer. The 
appellant-Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, has taken up the objections at the trial, and 
the trial court has not answered the objections raised. Whereas, on perusal of 
prosecution evidence, it reveals that Ex. PFF/1/58 (statement of Ahmad Bilal 
Adil) and Ex. PFF/1/2 (statement of Muhammad Ali) and invoices (Ex. 
PFF/1/18 to Ex. PFF/1/21, Ex. PFF/1/25 to Ex. PFF/1/31, Ex. PFF/1/39 to Ex. 
PFF/1/42, Ex. PFF/1/54 to Ex. PFF/1/57 relating to A.B. Pharma, Ex. PHH/1/4 
to Ex. PHH/1/9 relating to Gray’s Pharmaceuticals, Ex. PHH/1/57 to Ex. 
PHH/1/63 relating to Hammas Pharma and  Ex. PJJ/1/2 to Ex. PJJ/1/13 relating 
to Gray’s Pharmaceuticals) were not put to the accused. On the closure of 
prosecution evidence, the statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C. 
was recorded. We have noted that the questions put to the accused in the 
examination under section 342 of Cr.P.C. did not focus on the evidence on 
record, and appellant Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, Ahmad Bilal Adil (co-accused 
since acquitted), and Siraj Ahmad Abbasi (co-accused since acquitted) were, 
therefore, the prejudiced, and mere reference to fake and fabricated records was 
given, and exhibited documents were not brought to their notice. Question No.5 
put to appellant Muhammad Hanif Abbasi reads as follows: - 
Question No.5 
It is in the prosecution evidence that you 
supplied De-Asm tablets to AB Pharma & 
Hammas Pharma, College Road Rawalpindi as 
per your claim whereas bogus and fabricated 
record of such sale was provided by you and the 
said distributors.  
Questions No.2 and 4 put to Ahmad Bilal Adil read as under: -

26
It is in the prosecution evidence that you being 
distributor of Grays Pharma prepared and 
produced fake purchase record of De-Asm 
tablets in shape of purchase record without 
having sale record? 
Question No.4 
It is in the prosecution evidence that you 
facilitated, abetted and conspired with accused 
Muhammad Hanif Abbasi and others in 
preparation of fake bogus and fabricated record 
of De-Asm tablets?  
Similar question No. 3 was put to Siraj Ahmad Abbasi, which reads as under: - 
Question No.3 
It is in the prosecution evidence that you 
facilitated, abetted and conspired with accused 
Muhammad Hanif Abbasi and others in 
preparation of fake, bogus and fabricated 
record of manufacturing and distribution of De-
Asm tablets.  
Whereas Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code is as follows: -  
“342. Power to examine the accused.  
 
(1) 
For purpose of enabling the accused to explain 
any circumstances appearing in the evidence 
against him, the Court may, at any stage of any 
inquiry or trial without previously warning the 
accused, put such questions to him as the Court 
considers necessary, and shall, for the purpose 
aforesaid, question him generally on the case 
after the witness for the prosecution have been 
examined and before he is called on for his 
defence.  
(2) 
The accused shall not render himself liable to 
punishment by refusing to answer such 
questions, or by giving false answers to them, 
but the Court may draw such inference from 
such refusal or answers as it thinks just. 

Crl. Appeal No.663 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.684 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.685 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.834 of 2018  
& Crl. Appeal No.747 of 2018 
 
 
 
27
(3) 
The answers given by the accused may be taken 
into consideration in such inquiry or trial, and 
put in evidence for or against him in any other 
inquiry into, or trial for, any other offence 
which such answers may tend to show he has 
committed.   
(4) 
Except as provided by sub-section (2) of section 
340, no oath shall be administered to the 
accused.  
 
 
It is a consistent view of the Apex Court that any circumstance in 
respect of which an accused was not examined under section 342 of Cr.P.C. 
cannot be used against him/them. Non-indication of inculpatory material in its 
relevant facets by the trial court to the accused adds to the vulnerability of the 
prosecution case. The trial court was bound to ask such questions from an 
accused under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, which relates 
to the root of prosecution evidence based on his/their conviction. Thus, there is 
no evidence to prove that the invoices (Ex. PFF/1/18 to Ex. PFF/1/21, Ex. 
PFF/1/25 to Ex. PFF/1/31, Ex. PFF/1/39 to Ex. PFF/1/42, Ex. PFF/1/54 to Ex. 
PFF/1/57 relating to A.B. Pharma, Ex. PHH/1/4 to Ex. PHH/1/9 relating to 
Gray’s Pharmaceuticals, Ex. PHH/1/57 to Ex. PHH/1/63 relating to Hammas 
Pharma and  Ex. PJJ/1/2 to Ex. PJJ/1/13 relating to Gray’s Pharmaceuticals) was 
fake and fabricated, produced by Ahmad Bilal Adil (since acquitted) and Siraj 
Ahmad Abbasi (since acquitted) to facilitate appellant Muhammad Hanif Abbasi 
before Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director (PW-33). During the investigation, A.B. 
Pharmaceutical and Hammas Pharmaceutical companies claimed that they, 
being authorized distributors of Grays Pharmaceutical Company, sold the De-
ASM tablets to different shop-keepers and names of the same were produced 
during the investigation before the investigating officer and the said shopkeepers 
verified during the investigation that they received the medicine from A.B. 
Pharmaceutical and Hammas Pharmaceutical companies and they sold the same. 
The appellant’s stance is that he sold 3000 jars to A.B. Pharmaceutical and 2000 
jars to Hammas Pharmaceutical. That fact was verified during the investigation

by Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer. He 
(PW-35)-the investigating officer, admitted during cross-examination that: - 
“It is correct that during the investigation, the name 
of Shop Keepers told by Hammas Pharma and AB 
Pharma were joined in the investigation who told and 
gave statements to the fact that AB Pharma and 
Hammas Pharma supplied De-ASM Tablets to them 
which were sold by them.----------------It is correct that 
during investigation AB Pharma and Hammas 
Pharma provided invoices of purchase and sale of De-
ASM 
Tablets 
Manufactured 
by 
Grays 
Pharmaceutical Company and its supplied to 
different shop keepers. I did not get verified all the 
said invoices from any government laboratory/FSL.” 
 
 
The deposition of Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-
the investigating officer suggests, that shopkeepers admitted the receiving De-
ASM tablets from Hammas Pharma and AB Pharma and selling the same in the 
wholesale market. During cross-examination, Naveed Ahmad, Deputy Drug 
Controller (PW-7), admitted to taking De-ASM tablet samples from Trade 
Channel Bohar Bazaar Rawalpindi. Naveed Ahmad, Deputy Drug Controller 
(PW-7), deposed during cross-examination that: -

The stock returned by Hammas Pharma and AB Pharma reveals 
that Hammas Pharma sold 2882 jars, whereas 118 jars were returned to Grays 
Pharmaceutical Company. Similarly, AB Pharma sold 1909 jars, whereas 91 jars 
were returned to Grays Pharmaceutical Company. Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, 
Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer verified the return of jars to Grays 
Pharmaceutical Company (Ex.DF/1/7). During the examination-in-chief, Syed 
Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer deposed that: - 
“During the commencement of trial, accused Hanif 
Abbasi submitted an application before the Court for 
verification of the stock lying in the factory allegedly

returned from the distributor being expired. By order 
of the Court I visited the store built in the factory and 
found 5100 Jars of De-ASM Tablets lying in the 
store.” 
 
 
Whereas, during cross-examination, Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, 
Inspector, (PW-35)-the investigating officer, submitted that: - 
“It is correct that I found 5100 jars of De-ASM tablets 
(each for contains 1000 tablets) were lying in return 
and recall store of Grays Pharmaceutical Company. I 
have not submitted any separate to this respect, 
volunteered said that it is submitted with the report 
u/s 173 of Cr.P.C. It is incorrect to suggest that my 
volunteered portion is based on malafides. Neither the 
samples were taken from the said Jars, nor 
transmitted the same to NIH Islamabad/FSL Punjab 
for analysis. The above said jars were not taken into 
possession.” 
 
 
Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector, (PW-35)-the investigating 
officer, admitted during his testimony that at the court's direction, he visited the 
store built in the factory of Grays Pharmaceutical Company and found 5100 jars. 
However, he has not prepared any report nor exhibited the same in the evidence. 
He also admitted that he only found 5100 jars of De-ASM tablets present there. 
Although Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating 
officer, deposed that he prepared a separate report about the presence of 5100 
jars in the store built in the factory of Grays Pharmaceutical Company, the same 
was not exhibited in evidence. As per the prosecution case, tablets De-ASM had 
not been manufactured by Grays Pharmaceutical Company by the dossier 
submitted by Grays Pharmaceutical Company to the Ministry of Health, and 
only samples were prepared. After completing the investigation, Syed Imtiaz 
Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer- concluded that the 
accused were involved in the smuggling and misusing of Ephedrine, and this 
way, they took the law into their own hands. Contrary to the same, Syed Imtiaz 
Hussain Shah, Inspector, (PW-35)-the investigating officer, admitted during 
cross-examination that:-

“It is correct that as per record and investigation no 
Ephedrine in raw form was ever recovered. It is also 
correct that during the investigation, no person came 
forward and alleged that Ephedrine in raw form was 
ever sold in open market or purchased by any 
person.” 
 
 
Besides, Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director ANF (PW-33), who 
conducted an inquiry before the registration of FIR, admitted during cross-
examination that: - 
“In my inquiry report Ex-PBB, there is nowhere 
mentioned that any witness appeared before me, who 
stated that Ephedrine was sold or available in raw 
forms in open market. It is not mentioned in inquiry 
report Ex-PBB, that any quantity of Ephedrine was 
recovered from open market in raw form. I have not 
qualified Pharmacist.” 
 
 
So, the prosecution failed to establish that the appellant had sold the 
ephedrine to any smugglers and obtained illegal gain. As regards the charge of 
being involved in the smuggling of Ephedrine, it could not be established. 
15. 
 
As far as the allegation that ephedrine was not used for the 
manufacturing of medicine, as per the dossier of the Ministry of Health is 
concerned, Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating 
officer deposed during examination in chief that: - 
“On 11.08.2012, I joined Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, 
owner of Grays Pharmaceutical Company in the 
investigation and recorded his statement. It reflected 
from his statement under section 161 of Cr.P.C., that 
he got permission to establish Psychotropic Section in 
March 2009 and also got registered De-ASM tablets 
(for medicine Asthma disease) with Ministry of 
Health Islamabad. In month June, 2010, he applied 
for a quota of Ephedrine in a Ministry of Health, 
which was duly sanctioned from Ministry in month of 
July 2010. He further stated in his statement that 
company purchased 500-kgs Ephedrine from Alpha 
Chemical Lahore in the period from July 2010 to Dec 
2010. 
He 
further 
stated 
that 
his 
company

manufactured De-ASM tablets with the mark of PK. 
He further stated that there are 03 distributors of 
Grays Pharmaceutical Company namely Hammas 
Pharma College Road Rawalpindi, AB Pharma 
College Road, Rawalpindi and Arfat Traders.” 
16. 
 
Admittedly, during the investigation, Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, 
Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer, has not collected any material 
revealing that the appellant-Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, misused the ephedrine 
quota. Even he (PW-35) admitted during cross-examination that he conducted 
surprise raids on 27.07.2012 and 10.09.2012 at Grays Pharmaceutical Company 
and took into possession dyes and punches of De-ASM tablets and two jars of 
De-ASM vide recovery memo (Ex. PH). There is no material on record to show 
that the raw Ephedrine was found in possession of appellant Muhammad Hanif 
Abbasi or that the same was recovered from the premises of Grays 
Pharmaceutical Company. So, the prosecution failed to establish that the 
appellant-Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, misused the ephedrine quota or illegally 
used the same in producing any psychotropic substance. 
17. 
 
The deposition of Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-
the investigating officer, reveals that Grays Pharmaceutical Company was 
registered to manufacture medicine on 24.06.2003. Grays Pharmaceutical 
Company got permission to establish a psychotropic section in March 2009 and 
registered De-ASM tablets (cure for Asthma disease) with the Ministry of 
Health on 02.06.2010. The Ministry of Health, after observing all formalities, 
sanctioned a quota of 500 kilograms of ephedrine to Grays Pharmaceutical 
Company 
vide 
notification/letter 
No.F.13-3/2009-Reg-II-(M-218) 
dated 
02.06.2018 (Ex.DD/1-2) for manufacturing De-ASM tablets. According to the 
notification, 30 mg ephedrine HCL will be used for each De-ASM tablet. After 
that, Grays Pharmaceutical Company purchased 500 kg ephedrine from Alpha 
Chemical Lahore, and the same was delivered in different quantities in six 
months from 02.07.2010 to 01.02.2011. Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector 
(PW-35)-the investigating officer deposed during cross-examination that: -

“As per record of Grays Pharmaceutical Company, 
the period of batch manufacturing of De-ASM tables 
started from Sep, 2010 till Feb 2011.  It is correct that 
for manufacturing tablets, a set of dies and punches 
are required, which were recovered with PK mark. 
None else claimed ownership and manufacturing of 
De-ASM 
tablet 
except 
Grays 
Pharmaceutical 
Company during the course of investigation. No other 
company except Grays Pharmaceutical Company got 
registered its medicine with the brand name of De-
ASM tablet with its specific formula in the Ministry of 
Health. It is correct that no other dyes or purchase 
were taken into possession by me from any other 
company except that set of dyes and purchases having 
PK mark taken into possession by me from Grays 
Pharmaceutical Company, during the course of 
investigation------------------Neither recovered dyes and 
punches were sent to NIH as well as FSL for 
comparison nor any report was obtained from the 
above said offices--------------The Dyes and De-ASM 
tables were not sent by me to any authorized 
laboratory for comparison. Volunteered, said that De-
ASM tables were sent to NIH for analysis. It is correct 
that the De-ASM tablet was sent to the office of NIH 
for 
qualitative 
analysis. 
During 
course 
of 
investigation, it came to my notices that for 
preparation of plastic jars/packing material and 
labeling, 
material 
were 
ordered 
by 
Grays 
Pharmaceutical Company. Plastic Jars were got 
prepared from United Pharmaceutical Company and 
consignment was delivered through Noroz Goods. The 
bank statement of United Plastic Company and its 
invoices were taken into custody by me to verify the 
transaction made by Grays Pharmaceutical Company 
to United Plastic Company. It also came into my 
notice during course of investigation that order was 
placed to Printek printers Islamabad for printing to 
labels of De-ASM tablets with its formula. As per the 
record produced by Grays Pharmaceutical Company 
of different batches, 16586 Jars (each jar contained 
1000 tables of DE-ASM) were manufactures by Grays 
Pharmaceutical Company. I have given the details of 
the 
documents 
annexed 
with 
the 
police 
file 
underneath of the report u/s 173 of Cr.P.C. I have 
highlighted the recovery memos consist of 16 pages in

Karachi along with letter with my report u/s 173 of 
Cr.P.C. these report along with letters of RD ANF 
Karachi consist of 32 pages were taken into possession 
vide recovery memo Ex.PT. It is correct that except 
the recovery memo Ex.PT, I produced/exhibited all 
the remaining recovery memos in my examination in 
Chief along with all the documents which I taken into 
custody through those recovery memos. It is correct 
that these documents pertaining to reports dated 
13.08.2012, 04.09.2012 and 06.09.2012 issued by 
Provincial 
Government 
Analyst/Director 
Drugs 
Testing Laboratory Karachi these were not got 
exhibited in my statement inadvertently being 
photocopies. These reports are Ex.PT/1-13. It is 
correct that these reports were obtained under the 
direction and instruction of Colonel Asher Joint 
Director RD ANF Karachi. Volunteered said that 
these reports were not required not summoned by me, 
during the course of the investigation. -------------------
It is correct that these reports were taken into custody 
by me through Ex. PT. -------------It is true that the 
samples were taken by Arif Mathani, Provincial Drug 
Inspector, under the direction and instruction of ANF 
Karachi, and it is correct that Arif Mithani is cited as 
witness of the instant case and appeared in a witness 
box as PW-16. It is not in my knowledge that Abid 
Zulfiqar Deputy Director ANF Rawalpindi joined the 
Arif Mithani in the inquiry proceedings and also took 
into custody Ex.PT/1-13. It is incorrect to suggest that 
I am intentionally suppressing this fact. Abid Zulfiqar 
is the witness of the instant case and was examined as 
PW-33.” 
Muhammad Arif Mithani, (retired) Drug Inspector (PW-17), deposed during 
cross-examination that: - 
“My post was Provincial Drug Inspector. At the 
moment of my inspection of Arfat Trader 4000 jars 
were available there. It is correct that to maintain 
record of onward sale by the agent is responsibility of 
authorized agent and not of manufacturer. Arfat 
Traders categorically admitted that they have 
purchased this drug from Gray’s Pharma. Letters 
were sent by me on the address of factory situated in

1-9 area. Third letter was received to me from Gray’s 
Pharma that they have shifted to Rawat industrial 
estate. Result of all the samples was that all are of 
standard quality, containing Ephedrine HCL. HCL is 
a component of Ephedrine. Storage condition of Arfat 
Trader was up to standard.” 
Syed Muzafar Ali Jaffery, Provincial Drug Inspector (PW-18), deposed during 
examination-in-chief that: - 
“Stated that on 14.11.2012, I was posted as provincial 
drug inspector Karachi-IV (Korangi). I.O of the case 
Imtiaz Shah came in the office of Divisional Drug 
inspector Karachi Division. I met him there and 
inquired from me that in the year 2010-2011 where I 
was posted. I replied that during that period I was 
posted in Karachi-II, (Denso Katchhi Gali). He 
further inquired from me about Grays Pharma and 
DSM tablets about availability and sale purchase of 
said Tablets. I replied that there was no such issue 
and complaint at that time. This is my statement.” 
 
 
It is the prosecution case that the complaint (Ex. PA) was registered 
on the basis of the letter bearing No.3(44)/ANF/IR/Law/2011 dated 20.07.2012 
(Ex. PB) issued by Lieutenant Colonel Touqeer Abbas Zaidi, Joint Director 
(given up PW), which was based on the inquiry conducted by Abid Zulfiqar, 
Joint Director, ANF (PW-33). He (PW-33) admitted during cross-examination 
that: - 
“It is correct that at the time of my visit at Karachi, I 
met with Arif Mathani, Provincial Drug Inspector, 
who told me that he has collected on 19-07-2012, 
samples/Jars of 14 batches of De-ASM Tablets from 
Arfat Traders, which were sent to Drug Testing 
Laboratory Sindh. Volunteer that Secretary Quality 
Control Government of Sindh, wrote letter to Chief 
Inspector of Drug Sindh that he has not mentioned 
this fact in his monthly activity reports. It is incorrect 
to suggest that my volunteer portion is false and after-
thought. During those days Colonel Asshar Rizwan 
was Joint Director of RD Karachi. It is incorrect that 
procedure of collection of samples by Arif Mathani, 
Provincial Drug Inspector, Government of Sindh was

carried out on instruction of Joint Director Assher 
Rizwan of ANF RD Karachi. Above said Joint 
Director Assher Rizwan of ANF RD Karachi sent 
intimation of above facts to DG ANF Rawalpindi 
through a letter. Volunteer that it was sent very late. 
It is incorrect to suggest that my volunteer portion is 
false and after-thought. This fact of sending samples 
on the instruction of ANF Karachi by Arif Mathani of 
De-ASM Tablets on 19-07-2012 was not in our 
knowledge and prior from receipt of result, due to 
this reason we registered said FIR. Again said fact of 
collection of samples and sending of the same on 
instruction of ANF Karachi, was not in the knowledge 
of ANF RD Rawalpindi. Concerned Drug Testing 
Laboratory Government of Sindh Karachi issued 
reports of analysis of above referred samples. Above 
referred reports were sent to Headquarters ANF RD 
Rawalpindi by RD ANF Karachi, which are present 
on file. Volunteer that some were received after 
registration of case. Said reports were taken into 
possession 
through 
a 
recovery 
memo 
dated 
18.10.2012. Said reports are 13 in number of different 
batches. Photocopies of said reports along with 
photocopy of covering letter dated 18-10-2012, issued 
by Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Ishtiaq Ahmed on 
behalf of, (for) DG ANF are attached with recovery 
memo dated 18-10-2012.” 
Muhammad Arif Mithani (PW-16) deposed during examination in chief that: - 
“Stated that in the year 2012, I was posted as drug 
inspector of Katchi Gali and surrounding area 
medicine market. Divisional drug Inspector directed 
me to inquire into the matter of De-Asm Tab of Arfat 
Traders and find out facts and figures. I visited Arfat 
Traders and found Mr. Zulfiqar Sheikhani was 
Incharge of sales of Arfat Traders. I inquired from 
him about De-Asm tabs, he informed me that they 
purchased 11000 Jars which contain 1000 tablets in 
each jar from Gray’s Pharma and they have sold 6000 
Jars in the market. I reported about this fact to my 
senior. Then after couple of days I received another 
instruction that remaining 4000 jars need to be tested 
by Drug testing laboratory Sindh. I again visited 
Arfat Traders and collected 04 sample of each batch 
from total of 14 batches. I sent 01 sample of each

batch according to rules to drug testing laboratory, 
other sample of the batch to quality control board 
Sindh, 01 sample to the manufacturer i.e. Gray’s 
Pharma and 01 sample to Arfat Traders from where I 
collected samples. After some time I received reports 
from laboratory and submitted to my office. and 01 
copy to Arfat Rader and 01 copy to provincial quality 
control and sent 01 copy to RD ANF Karachi.” 
During cross-examination, Muhammad Arif Mithani (PW-16) deposed that: - 
“My post was Provincial Drug Inspector. At the 
moment of my inspection of Arfat Trader 4000 jars 
were available there. It is correct that to maintain 
record of onward sale by the agent is responsibility of 
authorized agent and not of manufacturer. Arfat 
Traders categorically admitted that they have 
purchased this drug from Gray’s Pharma. Letters 
were sent by me on the address of factory situated in 
1-9 area. Third letter was received to me from Gray’s 
Pharma that they have shifted to Rawat industrial 
estate. Result of all the samples was that all are of 
standard quality, containing Ephedrine HCL. HCL is 
a component of Ephedrine. Storage condition of Arfat 
Trader was up to standard.” 
 
 
Given the statement made by Muhammad Arif Mithani (PW-16), 
he witnessed 4000 jars available at the inspection of Arfat Trader. Similarly, at 
the cost of repetition, Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the 
investigating officer, deposed that he visited Grays Pharmaceutical Company on 
the direction passed by the trial court during the trial and found 5100 jars 
containing 1000 tablets in each jar, lying in the store of the factory. Admittedly, 
as per the record, 4000 jars were returned to Grays Pharmaceutical Company 
from Arfat Trader, included in the above-stated 5100 jars. Muhammad Idrees 
Sheikh (PW-22) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“In response to direction dated 22nd June 2012 of 
Chief Drug Inspector I had submitted a detailed 
report with reference to De-Asm Tablets from M/s 
Arfat Traders Karachi vide my letter number 
DCA/DDI/KHI/318/20 dated 09 July 2012 to him. I 
sent copies of the above-referred letter to Lt Col

Asher Rizwan as well as to Arif Mithani area Drug 
Inspector. Photocopy which has been shown to me is 
the correct photocopy of the same which contain my 
signatures, same is mark-DB. It is correct that it is 
mentioned in above letter that in compliance of 
direction of Chief Drug Inspector under my 
supervision Arif Mithani area drug inspector visited 
Arfat Trader on 25.06.2012 and 28.06.2012 was for 
purposes of investigation. Above said investigation 
was not for the purpose to ascertain sale, purchase 
and availability of De-Asm Tables, rather it was for 
verification of availability of De-Asm tablets. It is 
correct that in letter mentioned above written by me 
it is mentioned that purpose of visit/verification dated 
25.06.2012 and 28.06.2012 for investigation regarding 
legal aspect of sale and purchase of tablets De-Asm of 
different 
batches 
manufactured 
by 
Grays 
Pharmaceutical Islamabad. It is correct that it is 
mentioned in above letter regarding facts and figures 
that total 11106 Jars/Packs were purchase by Arfat 
Traders out of which 4454 Jars/Packs are available in 
stock, whereas 6652 jars/packs have been sold by M/s 
Arfat Traders. It is mentioned in letter number 
DCA/DDI dated 09.07.2012 that invoices of 11106 
jars/packs purchased from Grays Pharma by M/s 
Arfat Trader were also produced. I have not brought 
original record of above referred letters with me. In 
response to letter number DCA/DIDK/333/334 dated 
18 July 2012 was written by me to Joint Director ANF 
Karachi. I directed Drug Inspector Arif Mithani to 
submit the report of Provincial Government Analyst 
to ANF Karachi. I do not know whether he has sent 
said report or not. It is incorrect to suggest that I am 
intentionally suppressing the factum of sending of 
analysis reports to ANF.” 
 
 
Given the above prosecution evidence brought on the record, it 
reveals that Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director ANF (PW-33), admitted during cross-
examination that before registration of the instant criminal case, the fact of 
sending of samples) of De-ASM tablets on instructions of ANF Karachi by Arif 
Mathani (PW-16) was not in his knowledge. Before receipt of the result, they 
registered the FIR due to the said reason. He (PW-33) also admitted that due to 
this fact, FIR was registered.

Abid Zulfiqar, Joint Director, ANF (PW-33), also admitted during 
cross-examination that the fact of sending samples of De-Asm tablets (secured 
from Arfat traders) on instructions of ANF Karachi by Arif Mathani (PW-16) on 
19.07.2012 and its result was not in their knowledge. Due to this reason, they 
registered the instant FIR. So, if during inquiry proceedings, Abid Zulfiqar, Joint 
Director, ANF (PW-33), received the information that Arif Mathani (PW-16) 
collected samples of De-Asm tablets (secured from Arfat traders) on instructions 
of ANF Karachi and sent to the testing laboratory and after that received its 
report, the FIR should not have been registered. The malafide on the part of the 
prosecution was also revealed from the fact that Abid Zulfiqar, Deputy Director, 
ANF (PW-33), admitted during cross-examination that - 
“A dispute in between ANF RD Karachi and 
ANF RD Rawalpindi took place with regard to 
the inquiry of ANF Karachi.”

From the above-discussed evidence of the prosecution, it has been 
established on record that the appellant’s pharmaceutical company was allocated 
a quota of 500 Kg Ephedrine by the rules and regulations of the Ministry of 
Health. Now the question arises as to whether the same was utilized in the 
manner as specified under the Control of Narcotic Substances (Regulation of 
Drugs of Abuse, Controlled Chemicals, Equipment, and Materials) Rules, 2001, 
or the same was misused, sold, distributed, delivered or transported illegally as 
alleged by the prosecution. The answer to this pivotal question is also in the 
prosecution evidence, as admitted by Muhammad Idrees Sheikh (PW-22). It is a 
matter of record that the appellant’s company manufactured De-Asm tablets in 
different batches. It is also not a denying fact that the appellant’s company has 
three authorized distributors, namely Arafat Traders Karachi, AB Pharma 
Rawalpindi, and Hammas Pharma Rawalpindi, and it supplied the tablets to the 
said distributors in the following manner: -

The Investigating Officer (PW-35) conceded that at the time of the 
inspection, 5100 jars of De-ASM tablets of different Batches, including Batch 
No. 086, were available in the appellant’s company. It reveals that the returned 
jars and others of De-ASM tablets, are included therein. It becomes almost the 
same number if we calculate returned jars by the distributors and others 
available in the appellant’s company. We can, therefore, safely conclude that the 
prosecution, by its evidence, has proved that the appellant’s company has 
manufactured the De-ASM tablets and utilized the Ephedrine quota legally 
allotted to him. The learned law officer pointed out that the appellant’s company 
had not used 3.7 kg of Ephedrine, and the same was misused, having no answer 
by the defence. This stance of the law officer has no legs to stand on. According 
to prosecution evidence, the appellant’s company utilized all the Ephedrine 
quota, whereas the minor quantity could have been wasted during 
manufacturing. It is known to everyone that during the manufacturing process of 
every item, some of the raw material is to be wasted. Abid Zulfiqar, Joint 
Director, ANF (PW-33), while appearing in the dock in the Courtroom, deposed 
as under: - 
“ Ghazanfar Ali, Quality Control Manager of 
Grays Pharma, stated before me that during 
manufacturing process of medicine, there is 1% of 
wastage (Under objection by learned defence 
counsel), whereas, as per production record of 
Grays Pharma wastage is 0.29% (Under Objection 
by learned defence counsel), whereas, as per British 
Pharma Copiah and US Pharma-LED, wastage 
from 3% to 5% occurred( under objection of 
learned defence counsel).”

From the testimony of this witness, we can safely conclude that no 
hard and fast rule can be applied for calculating the percentage of wastage. 
However, the witness above, during cross-examination, conceded that neither 
the prosecution has any witness who can claim that the Ephedrine was sold or 
available in raw form in the open market nor the same was recovered from the 
possession of anyone. Therefore, we have no hesitation in believing the version 
of the defence that the rest of the Ephedrine, i.e., 3.7 kg, has been wasted while 
manufacturing the tablets. The prosecution has miserably failed to bring on 
record any iota of material from which it could be proved that the quota of 
Ephedrine allotted to the appellant’s company was misused, sold, distributed, 
delivered, transported, or smuggled in violation of the above rules.  
20. 
 
It prima facie appears from the material available on record that 
there is no connecting link that the appellant-Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, had sold 
out Ephedrine to anyone, including smugglers, and no misuse of Ephedrine has 
been brought on the record by the prosecution. There is no material on record to 
show that co-accused Ghazanfar Ali, Rana Mohsan Khursheed, Nasir Khan, 
Nazakat Khan, Basit Abbasi, Ahmed Bilal Aadil and Siraj Ahmed Abbasi 
abetted and facilitated the appellant-Muhammad Hanif Abbasi in non-
compliance of Control of Narcotic Substances (Regulation of Drugs of Abuse, 
Controlled Chemicals, Equipment and Materials) Rules 2001. So, after 
considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the points discussed 
above, we conclude that the prosecution has not been able to prove the charge 
leveled against the appellant, Muhammad Hanif Abbasi. Since there was 
inherent illegality in the matter, the conviction cannot be upheld, and findings in 
this regard are required to be set aside, and the same are set aside and as a 
consequence of which Crl. Appeal No.663 of 2018 is allowed, and Muhammad 
Hanif Abbasi, the appellant, is ordered to be acquitted of the charge in case FIR 
No.41, dated 21.07.2012, registered under sections 9(c), 14 & 15 of the Control

appellant is on bail. His surety stands discharged.

So far as Crl. Appeal No.684 of 2018 (Muhammad Asif 
Sheikhani Vs. The State, etc.), Crl. Appeal No.685 of 2018 (Muhammad 
Zulfikar Shekhani Vs. The State, etc.) and Crl. Appeal No.834 of 2018 (Mst. 
Razia Zahid Bakhtawari Vs. The State etc.) are concerned, learned counsel 
for the appellants argued that the findings of the investigating agency in respect 
of the involvement of the appellants and declaration of status of prosecution 
witnesses to the appellants was legal, lawful and was in the line of fair trial 
guaranteed under the constitution; that grant of permission by the Magistrate for 
recording of statements of the appellants under section 164 of Cr.P.C was an 
agreement with the investigating agency regarding innocence of the appellants 
and they were rightly declared prosecution witnesses; that the charge sheet was 
submitted before the learned trial court, in which all the facts were narrated and 
charge was framed based on charge sheet without taking any option for 
clearance of the legal position of the persons named as prosecution witnesses. 
Lastly, they prayed for setting aside the orders passed in paragraphs Nos.46 and 
60 of the impugned judgment dated 21.07.2018.

The plea raised by the learned counsel for the appellants in Crl. 
Appeal No.684 of 2018, Crl. Appeal No.685 of 2018 and Crl. Appeal No.834 of 
2018 has been taken into consideration along with depositions of appellants 
Razia Zahid, Muhammad Asif Sheikhani, and Muhammad Zulfiqar Sheikhani, 
recorded by the learned trial court as PW-19, PW-21, and PW-23, respectively, 
as well as of Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector, (PW-35)-the investigating 
officer and Ahmad Hassan Ranjha, Special Magistrate (PW-30) and all 
documentary evidence. Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the 
investigating officer admitted during cross-examination that: -

10.06.2013 
from 
Jinnah 
International 
Airport 
Karachi and after transit custody, I obtained his 
physical remand on different occasion till 20.06.2013. 
It is correct that after obtaining non bailable 
warrants of Asif Sheikhani and Zulfiqar Sheikhani I 
got declared them proclaimed offender from the 
concerned court. Volunteered that they were not 
joining the investigation this was the reason, I 
adopted the said procedure. It is incorrect to suggest 
that my volunteered portion is incorrect, false and 
afterthought. It is correct that Asif Sheikhani and 
Zulfiqar Sheikhani filed writ petition No.2508/2013 
(Ex.DC) before Hon’able Sindh High Court, Karachi, 
against me by name and Federation of Pakistan.  
Volunteered that neither I appeared in said writ 
petition nor any order was passed in the same. It is 
incorrect to suggest that my volunteered portion is 
based on mala fide. It is incorrect to suggest that Asif

Sheikhani provided complete details of supplied of 
different shop keepers to ANF. It is correct that the 
alleged statement u/s 164 of Cr.P.C of Zulfiqar 
Sheikhani was got recorded by me, during the period 
when his brother Asif Sheikhani was in my custody 
under physical remand. It is incorrect to suggest that 
I deliberately did not produce the complete record

Asif Sheikhani was released on bail by this Hon’able 
Court on the basis of conceding statement of Special 
Prosecutor ANF. Volunteered that Asif Sheikhani was 
declared innocent. It is incorrect to suggest that my 
volunteered portion is based on mala fide. It is correct 
that on 26.06.2013, I got recorded the alleged 
statement of Asif Sheikhani u/s 164 Cr.P.C after his 
release. It is not in my knowledge that Special Judicial 
Magistrate who recorded the alleged statement u/s 
164 Cr.P.C, when appeared before this Hon’able 
Court as PW-30, he categorically stated on oath that 
the Investigating Officer if produced the entire record 
qua status and warrants of Asif Sheikhani and 
Zulfiqar Sheikhani, I could not recorded their 
statements u/s 164 Cr.P.C. I did not obtain any order 
from the court of competent jurisdiction to transpose 
Asif Sheikhani and Zulfiqar Sheikhani from the 
status of accused into witnesses. It is correct that as 
per FIR there were two nominated accused namely 
Muhammad Haneef Abbasi and Razia Zahid 
Bakhtawary in the case. Neither, I obtained any 
discharge order from the court of competent 
jurisdiction qua Razia Zahid Bakhtawary, nor 
regarding her transposition from status of an accused 
person to a witness. Volunteered that I have 
mentioned this fact in my report u/s 173 Cr.P.C. It is 
incorrect to suggest that my volunteered portion is

merely 
based 
on

Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer also 
admitted during examination-in-chief that: - 
“On 11-06-2013 Asif Sheikhani was arrested at 
Karachi Airport and after intimation, I visited Karachi 
and obtained him on transit remand. I produced the 
accused before the learned Ilaqa Magistrate and

statement. On the same day, I produced him before the 
Special Judicial Illaqa Magistrate, wherein his statement 
was recorded u/s 164 of Cr.P.C. On 24.06.2013 Asif 
Sheikhani was admitted on a post-arrest bail. On 
26.06.2013, he voluntarily appeared before a learned 
Special Judicial Magistrate and got recorded his 
statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C.”  
(Bold and underline for emphasis). 
Muhammad Asif Sheikhani (PW-21) admitted during cross-examination that: - 
“I was arrested in this case and subsequently, I was 
admitted to bail by this court.” 
Muhammad Zulfiqar Sheikhani (PW-23) also admitted during cross-
examination that: - 
“It is correct that my brother Muhammad Asif 
Sheikhan was arrested on 10-06-2013 from Jinnah 
International Airport Karachi by ANF. He remained 
in custody of ANF Rawalpindi on physical remand 
from 10-06-2016 to 20-06-2013. He was admitted to 
bail by this Court (CNS Court) Rawalpindi in this 
case on 24-06-2013. I obtained protective bail for 15 
days from Karachi when I came to Rawalpindi for the 
cancellation 
of 
my 
warrants 
and 
subsequent 
proceedings. I did not obtain bail from this court or 
any other court subsequently in this case. On 19-06-
2013 when my statement u/s 161 of Cr.P.C was 
recorded by ANF in this case, my real brother 
Muhammad Asif Sheikhani was in physical custody of 
ANF Rawalpindi. It is correct that warrants of arrest 
issued against me were not got cancelled from any 
court, nor withdrawn till the date of recording of my 
statement u/s 161 of Cr.P.C. it is correct that I have 
not mentioned in writ petition Ex-DC and application 
for cancellation of warrants regarding the facts which 
I deposed in court today.” 
 
 
Ahmad Hassan Ranjha, Special Magistrate (PW-30), recorded 
statements under section 164 of Cr.P.C. of the appellants, Muhammad Asif

specifically stated during examination-in-chief that Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, 
Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer, moved an application (Ex. PX) 
before him for recording the statement of Muhammad Zulfiqar Sheikhani (the 
appellant in Crl. Appeal No.685/2018) on 19.06.2013. He (PW-30) further 
stated that on 26.06.2013, Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the 
investigating officer, moved an application (Ex. PZ) for recording the statement 
of Muhammad Asif Sheikhani (the appellant in Crl. Appeal No.684/2018) and 
on 12.09.2013 submitted application (Ex. PAA) for recording statement of Mst. 
Razia Zahid Bakhtawari (the appellant in Crl. Appeal No.834 of 2018). Based 
on the applications above, he (PW-30) recorded the statements of the appellants, 
Muhammad Asif Sheikhani, Muhammad Zulfiqar Sheikhani, and Mst. Razia 
Zahid Bakhtawari, under section 164 of Cr.P.C. From the deposition of Ahmad 
Hassan Ranjha, Special Magistrate (PW-30), and Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, 
Inspector, (PW-35)-the investigating officer, it reveals that Muhammad Asif 
Sheikhani (the appellant in Crl. Appeal No.684 of 2018) was under arrest. He 
was released on post-arrest bail by the learned trial court on 24.06.2013. During 
the physical remand of Asif Sheikhani, on 19.06.2013, Zulfiqar Sheikhani was 
produced before Ahmad Hassan Ranjha, Special Magistrate (PW-30), and his 
statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. was recorded by Ahmad Hassan Ranjha, 
Special Magistrate (PW-30). The application (Ex. PZ) was made by Syed Imtiaz 
Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-the investigating officer, for recording the 
statement of Muhammad Asif Sheikhani; after that, his statement was recorded. 
Admittedly, Muhammad Asif Sheikhani was on physical remand, and 
Muhammad Zulfiqar Sheikhani was on pre-arrest bail during the proceedings of 
recording of statement under section 164 of Cr.P.C. of Muhammad Zulfiqar 
Sheikhani. It is admitted that post-arrest bail was never granted to any 
prosecution witness until and unless they were named as an accused for 
committing the cognizable offence. The prosecution deliberately withheld the 
truth. As per the procedure laid down under section 494 of Cr.P.C. for 
withdrawal of the prosecution, the Public Prosecutor may, with the court’s 
consent before the judgment is pronounced, withdraw from the prosecution of

any person either generally or in respect of any one or more of the offences for 
which he is tried. For convenience, an extract of section 494 of Cr.P.C. is 
reproduced hereunder: - 
“Section.494. Effect of withdrawal from prosecution. 
—Any Public Prosecutor may, with the consent of the 
Court, before the judgment is pronounced, withdraw 
from the prosecution of any person either generally or 
in respect of any one or more of the offences for which 
he is tried----------.” 
 
 
Admittedly, the Special Prosecutor for ANF has not approached the 
court to withdraw prosecution against the appellants, Muhammad Asif 
Sheikhani, Muhammad Zulfiqar Sheikhani, and Mst. Razia Zahid Bakhtawari. 
The principle for tendering pardon to an accomplice or its revocation is 
contained in sections 337 to 339 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, under 
Chapter XXIV. The principles of tendering a pardon to an accomplice in section 
337 of Cr.P.C. have already been explained. The purpose of tendering pardon to 
an accomplice is mainly to un-reveal the truth in a grave offence so that the guilt 
of other accused persons concerned in committing a crime could be brought 
home. The object of section 337 of Cr.P.C. is to allow pardon in cases where a 
heinous offence is alleged to have been committed by several persons so that 
with the aid of the evidence of the person granted pardon, the evidence may be 
brought home to the rest. Section 337 of Cr.P.C. empowers a Magistrate or the 
trial court to tender a pardon to a person supposed to have been directly or 
indirectly concerned in, or privy to an offence, to which this section applies at 
any stage of the investigation or inquiry or trial of the crime on condition of 
their making a full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within 
his knowledge relative to the offence. The Magistrate of 1st Class is also 
empowered to tender pardon to an accomplice during the trial but not at the 
stage of investigation on condition of his making full and true disclosure of 
entire circumstances within his knowledge relative to the crime. Section 338 of 
Cr.P.C. vests the court to which the commitment is made with the power to 
tender pardon to an accomplice. An accomplice who has been given a pardon

& Crl. Appeal No.747 of 2018

under sections 337 and 338 of Cr.P.C. gets protection from the prosecution 
when they are called as a witness for the prosecution. They must comply with 
the condition of their making a full and true disclosure of the whole 
circumstances within their knowledge relating to evidence under his knowledge 
and in the knowledge of any other person, whether as principal or abettor, in the 
commission thereof and if they possess any material within their knowledge, 
concerning the commission of a crime or to refuse to comply with the condition 
on which tender was given to them, the public prosecutor shall give a notice 
under section 338 of Cr.P.C. to that effect, and the protection given to them is 
lifted.  
23. 
 
Admittedly, the prosecution has not adopted the procedure under 
section 337 of Cr.P.C. for recording the accomplice’s statement. If the process 
provided for the withdrawal of the prosecution and tendering of pardon to the 
accomplice was adopted, the immunity extended to the accused, and the accused 
is made an approver; they stand discharged, and after that, he ceases to be an 
accused and would be examined as a witness unless said privy is revoked on 
violation of the condition to disclosing the complete truth. The facts reveal that 
none of the ingredients necessary for exercising the powers under Section 337 
Cr.P.C. stood fulfilled or satisfied. The prosecution, by way of concealment of 
facts, has cheated Ahmad Hassan Ranjha, Special Magistrate (PW-30), and got 
recorded statements under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 
appellants, i.e., Muhammad Asif Sheikhani, Muhammad Zulfiqar Sheikhani, and 
Mst. Razia Zahid Bakhtawari and the same were rightly not relied upon by the 
Learned trial Judge and revoked the pardon granted to these appellants. But so 
far as calling upon SHO Police Station ANF RD North Rawalpindi to submit the 
fresh report as required under Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code 
against the appellants, i.e., Muhammad Asif Sheikhani, Muhammad Zulfiqar 
Sheikhani, and Mst. Razia Zahid Bakhtawari, the record’s perusal reveals that 
the above-said appellants, i.e., Muhammad Asif Sheikhani, Muhammad Zulfiqar 
Sheikhani, and Mst. Razia Zahid Bakhtawari being prosecution witnesses, i.e., 

Crl. Appeal No.663 of 2018,

Razia Zahid (PW-19), Muhammad Asif Sheikhani (PW-21), Muhammad 
Zulifqar Sheikhani (PW-23), and Syed Imtiaz Hussain Shah, Inspector (PW-35)-
the investigating officer suppressed the real facts from the court while appearing 
as prosecution witnesses in their examination-in-chief regarding the status of the 
appellants, i.e., Muhammad Asif Sheikhani, Muhammad Zulfiqar Sheikhani, and 
Mst. Razia Zahid Bakhtawari. Muhammad Zulfiqar Sheikhani (PW-23) (in Crl. 
Appeal No.685/2018) deposed in his examination-in-chief that: - 
“During the months of June-July 2012 Arif Mithani 
drug area Inspector as per routine checkup came on 
our shop and inquired about De-Asm Tablets. On 
demand of samples of De-Asm by him, out of 100 jars 
placed by Grays Pharma at our shop, he obtained 56 
jars for sampling. On inquiry of remaining stock of 
jars Muhammad Arif Mithani was shown De-Asm 
Tablets of Safe Pharma which were placed in 
cartoons as 4400 jars and he was got satisfied and he 
became assured that these jars are of Grays Pharma 
whereas infect tablets of De-Asm of Grays Pharma 
never came on our shop, nor were sold to anyone, 
neither any record of said tablets is available.” 
Whereas, during cross-examination, Muhammad Zulfiqar Sheikhani (PW-23) 
admitted that:- 
“ANF Rawalpindi obtained warrants of arrest of 
myself and my brother Muhammad Asif Sheikhani on 
27.11.2012. it is correct that on 05.04.2013 ANF got 
declared me and my brother Muhammad Asif 
Sheikhani as Absconders in this particular case. On 
18.4.2013 I and my brother Muhammad Asif 
Shekhani moved application before Magistrate for 
cancellation of our warrants of arrest. On 07.06.2013 
I and my brother Muhammad Asif Shekhani filed 
writ petition No.2508 of 2013 dated 07.06.2013 before 
Sindh High Court with regard to issuance of non-
bailable warrants of arrest and action subsequent to it 
against us dated 27.11.2012. Writ petition No.2508 of 
2013 Ex-DC contains my signatures as Ex-DC/4. I 
have mentioned in para-4 of the said petition that on 
04.06.2012, 12.06.2012, 19.06.2012, and 17.07.2012 we 
appeared before ANF Rawalpindi and provided 

Crl. Appeal No.663 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.684 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.685 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.834 of 2018  
& Crl. Appeal No.747 of 2018 
 
 
 
49
required documents and detail regarding purchase, 
sale, and supply of medicine manufactured by Grays 
Pharma. It is correct that in Para-5 of Ex-DC it is 
mentioned by us that, after lodging of FIR, petitioners 
were again called at Rawalpindi for giving of detail of 
tablets made by M/s Grays Pharma Islamabad on 
01.08.2012 and 06.09.2012, where the record earlier 
submitted by the petitioners was verified up-to the 
satisfaction of ANF Rawalpindi. It is correct that in 
Para No.6 it is mentioned that during inquiry the 
ANF had referred the record/stock of the petitioners 
M/s. Arfat Traders to drug authorities in Sindh who 
had collected samples and checked the stock in the 
premises of M/s. Arfat Traders Karachi and also 
collected the sale record of the medicine. The samples 
of the same were dispatched as per drug rules and 
sent to Rawalpindi Regional Directorate ANF for 
their official record. The data collected by the drug 
authorities states that about 11000 Jars of 1000 De-
Asm tablets received from the M/s Grays Pharma by 
M/s. Arfat Traders, 6000 Jars were sold out in the 
open market but the record of the sale is not available 
and 5000 Jars were sent back to the company due to 
non-sale and expiry of the medicines. The record 
submitted by the petitioner regarding De-Asm tablet 
were submitted before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan by the ANF which is now a matter of record. 
It is correct that Arif Mithani drug inspector Karachi 
collected samples from 14 batches for analysis and 
report of the same came with positive result. At the 
time of visit of Arif Mithani drug inspector Karachi, I 
made statement before him that Arfat Traders 
purchased 11000 Jars of De-Asm Tablets from Grays 
Pharma and out of the same sold out 6000 Jars and 
due to expiry date returned back 4000 Jars to Grays 
Pharma.” 
Muhammad Asif Sheikhani (PW-21)-the appellant (in Crl. Appeal No.684 of 
2018) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“It is correct that I Muhammad Asif Sheikhani and 
my brother Muhammad Zulfiqar Sheikhani have 
filed writ petition No.2508/13 on 08.06.2013 before the 
Hon’ble Sindh High Court, Karachi. It is correct that 
certified copy of writ petition Ex.DC is the copy of 

Crl. Appeal No.663 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.684 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.685 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.834 of 2018  
& Crl. Appeal No.747 of 2018

same writ petition containing my signatures as the 
same as Ex.DC/1. It is correct that in para-No.02 of 
Ex-DC, it is mentioned that we both brothers are 
running business of finish medicine as whole 
sellers/traders in the name and style of Arfat Traders 
Karachi at medicine market at Kachi Gali No.2, 
Karachi since 1992. Volunteers that I am partner of 
Safe Pharma and Arfat Traders is my distributer 
also. It is correct that Asmat Ullah Khan, Deputy 
Director, ANF RD, Karachi wrote a letter dated 
28.05.2012 Mark-DA to Arfat Traders and sought 
detail of sale of medicine in which Ephedrine has been 
used as a content. We have mentioned in Para No.03 
of Writ petition Ex-DC that in the month of May 
2012ANF summoned detail of sale of medicine 
regarding grant of quota of Ephedrine and its 
utilization as the whole sale trader of Messer Gray’s 
Pharma in Karachi in form of De-Asm. We have 
mentioned in Para 04 of writ petition Ex-DC that in 
response of above referred letter and inquiry of ANF, 
we 
have 
submitted 
detail 
vide 
letters 
dated 
04.06.2012, 12.06.2012, 19.06.2012 and 17.07.2012. 
Letter dated 04.06.2012, Ex-DD is signed by me, but I 
do not remember what is the detail of the same. I do 
not remember whether detail mentioned in said letter 
was correct. It is correct that as per above letter, it is 
mentioned therein that 4200 Jars of De-Asm tablets 
are lying in the stock of Arfat Traders, whereas Arfat 
Traders has sold out 6906 Jars of De-Asm tablets to 
different customers. It is correct that my detailed 
affidavit Ex-DC/2 is annexed with writ petition 
No.2508/13which contains my signatures as Ex-DC/3. 
It is correct that in Para No.6 of the writ petition Ex-
DC, detail of supply of De-Asm tablets to Arfat 
Traders by Gray’s Pharma coupled with record of 
sold out tablets and remaining stock of tablets is 
mentioned. It is also mentioned in this Para that ANF 
also collected samples from the stock of De-Asm 
tablets for analysis. It is correct that alongwith writ 
petition No.2508/13 on its pages, 19, 20 and 21 letter 
dated 03.10.2012 of provincial inspector drug Karachi 
to Chief Drug Inspector Sindh is attached containing 
the detail of purchase, sale, and stock of the De-Asm 
tablet is provided volunteers that it is on behalf of 
Arfat Traders. Arfat Traders is trader/agent of Grays 
Pharma. It is correct that ANF Rawalpindi issued 

Crl. Appeal No.663 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.684 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.685 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.834 of 2018  
& Crl. Appeal No.747 of 2018 
 
 
 
51
warrants of arrest for my appearance before ANF 
and I have filed application before Magistrate at 
Rawalpindi on 18.04.2013 for withdrawal of warrants 
and copy of said application was also attached with 
writ petition at its pages No.71 to 77 mentioning 
whole the detail in said application, volunteers that as 
I was being summoned as a witness and due to my 
non coming and seeking time my warrants were 
issued. I do not know whether reports of samples 
taken as mentioned above were delivered to Arfat 
Traders. I do not remember whether letter dated 
11.05.2012 on behalf of Arfat Traders, is signed by 
me, again said, said letter contains my signatures, 
again I do not remember this fact. I can recognize my 
signatures. Signatures present on Ex-DC are mine.” 
 
 
Admittedly, Muhammad Asif Sheikhani (PW-21) and Muhammad 
Zulfikar Sheikhani (PW-22) (appellants in Crl. Appeal No.684 of 2018 and Crl. 
Appeal No.685 of 2018, respectively) admitted the facts which favor them, but 
at the same time, they tried to twist them to save their skins and shift the 
responsibilities on the principal accused, i.e., Muhammad Hanif Abbasi.  
24. 
 
Given above, Crl. Appeal No.684 of 2018 (Muhammad Asif 
Sheikhani. Vs. The State), Crl. Appeal No.685 of 2018 (Muhammad 
Zulfikar Shekhani. vs. the State) and Crl. Appeal No.834 of 2018 (Mst. 
Razia Zahid Bakhtawari. Vs. The State) are concerned, the findings given by 
the learned trial court in paragraph No.46 are well reasoned, and the same are 
upheld. However, the judgment dated 21.07.2018 passed by the learned trial 
court has been set aside by this Court in main Crl. Appeal No.663 of 2018, 
therefore, findings of the learned trial court in paragraph No.60 have lost their 
relevance. With these modifications, Crl. Appeal No.684 of 2018 (Muhammad 
Asif Sheikhani Vs. The State.), Crl. Appeal No.685 of 2018 (Muhammad 
Zulfikar Shekhani Vs. The State.) and Crl. Appeal No.834 of 2018 (Mst. 
Razia Zahid Bakhtawari Vs. The State) stands disposed of. 
25. 
 
So far as Crl. Appeal No.747 of 2018 filed by Anti Narcotics 
Force against the acquittal of co-accused Nasir Khan, Ghazanfar Ali, Rana 

Crl. Appeal No.663 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.684 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.685 of 2018, 
Crl. Appeal No.834 of 2018  
& Crl. Appeal No.747 of 2018

Mohsin Khurasheed, Siraj Ahmad Abbas, Nazakat Khan, Basit Abbasi, and 
Ahmad Bilal is concerned, they have been assigned the role of abetting, 
associating and aiding the principal accused but none of the prosecution 
witnesses while appearing in the dock in the Courtroom uttered even a single 
word in what manner the said accused persons abetted, associated or aided the 
principal accused. One of the acquitted co-accused, namely Muhammad Basit 
Abbasi, was the real brother of the principal accused, while the rest of the 
accused persons were stated to be the employees of Gray Pharmaceutical 
Company, owned by the principal accused. Therefore, the possibility cannot be 
ruled out that they were booked in this case to tighten the noose of the principal 
accused. Moreover, the principal accused has also been acquitted of the charge 
for the reasons enumerated hereinabove. Therefore, this ground alone is 
sufficient to decline interference in the acquittal order of the co-accused. Even 
otherwise, it is a settled principle of law that after acquittal, an accused earns a 
double presumption of innocence, which can only be repelled/overturned if the 
acquittal order/judgment appears perverse, arbitrary, capricious, or patently 
illegal. Reliance is placed on cases reported as “MUHAMMAD AZAM and 
others Versus. THE STATE (2009 SCMR 1232)”  and “Haji AMANULLAH vs. 
MUNIR AHMED and others (2010 SCMR 222)”. The impugned judgment qua 
acquittal of co-accused does not fall under any of the above parameters; as such, 
we are not inclined to intervene with the same. Resultantly, Crl. Appeal No.747 
of 2018 stands dismissed.
