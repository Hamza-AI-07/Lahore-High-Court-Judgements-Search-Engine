were provoked and were raising slogans that accused of burning of Holy 
Quran should also be burnt at the place where he had burnt the Holy Quran. 
On hearing announcements in the Masajid, he informed high-ups through

produced Dr. Abdul Rauf (DW-1) in his defence and the trial ended in the 
terms as detailed in the opening paragraph of this judgment. 
4.     Learned counsel for the appellants states that offence of rioting require 
a precise intention of the participants to commit an intended offence and mob 
psychology is driven by heat and passion without any pre-concert, therefore, 
very root of formation of unlawful assembly is weak and it also had no 
support of proper identification of the appellants while committing such 
offence. Learned DPG though controverted the arguments but could not deny 
the fact that on the basis of similar evidence number of accused have been 
acquitted by the learned trial court as well as by this court.   
5. 
Heard. Record perused. The contention of the appellants’ counsel is 
required to be thrashed in order to see the fact-statement of offence of rioting 
as well as the nature of evidence required to prove such offence.  
 
6.     An offence is a statement of facts embodied in a section of law which 
are to be proved as required through the definition given in such section of 
law. We know ‘riot’ is a disturbance of the peace by several persons, 
assembled and acting with a common intent in exercising a lawful or 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022. 
 
6
 
 
unlawful enterprise in a violent and turbulent manner. Bifurcating such 
definition into segments will show that disturbance of peace, like obstruction 
of roads, damage to property or injuries to persons, is to be proved by the 
evidence of illegal acts at the site, and that too by several persons, and if it 
was a lawful act then violent or turbulent manner shall be proved; both 
situations require that a pre-concert is to be proved for attracting common 
intent, or the circumstances which united the people to act with common 
intent at spur of the moment.   
             Riot, rout, and unlawful Assembly are related offences, yet they are 
separate and distinct. A ‘rout’ differs from a ‘riot’, in which the persons 
involved do not actually execute their purpose but merely move toward it. 
The degree of execution that converts rout into riot is often difficult to 
determine. Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (PPC) also identifies the offence of 
rioting as given in section 146 which is as under; 
146. Rioting; Whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly, or 
by any member thereof, in prosecution of the common object of such assembly, 
every member of such assembly is guilty of the offence of rioting.  
 
        Above section of law reflects that when force or violence will be used 
by an unlawful assembly with the intent mentioned therein then it would 
become an offence of rioting. In order to attract the offence of rioting, it is 
necessary to see the formation of unlawful assembly which is dealt u/s 141 
of PPC as under; 
 
141. Unlawful assembly; An assembly of five or more persons is 
designated an "unlawful assembly" if the common object of the persons 
composing that assembly is:- 
First: 
To overawe by criminal force, or show of criminal force, the 
Federal or any Provincial Government or Legislature, or any 
public servant in the exercise of the lawful power of such 
public servant; or 
Second: To resist the execution of any law, or of any legal process, or 
Third: To commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence; 
or 
Fourth: By means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to any 
person to take or obtain possession of any property, or to 
deprive any person of the enjoyment of a right of way, or of 
the use of water or other incorporeal right of which he is in 
possession or enjoyment, or to enforce any right or supposed 
right; or 
Fifth: 
By means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to 
compel any person to do what he is not legally bound to do, or 
to omit to do what he is legally entitled to do. 
 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022.

Explanation: An assembly which was not unlawful when it assembled, 
may subsequently become an unlawful assembly. 
 
           Above section clearly requires what sort of actions are to be proved 
for alleging that the offence has been committed.  
7.     Similarly in different laws, during the rioting certain other offences are 
also committed, requirement for proving such offences can be judged 
keeping in view the definition given in that law. e.g.  offence of ‘lynching’ 
(Section 11-WW) under Anti-terrorism Act, 1997, Sabotage (section-20) 
under Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960, offences under Anti-
National activities etc.  
            Lynching is an extrajudicial killing by a group. It is most often used 
to characterize informal public executions by a mob in order to punish an 
alleged transgressor, punish a convicted transgressor, or intimidate people. 
It can also be an extreme form of informal group social control, and it is 
often conducted with the display of a public spectacle (often in the form of 
a hanging) for maximum intimidation. Instances of lynchings and similar 
mob violence can be found in every society. Therefore, it can be said that 
lynching is a form of violence in which a mob, under the pretext of 
administering justice without trial, executes a presumed offender, often after 
inflicting torture and corporal mutilation.  
                The term ‘lynch law’ refers to a self-constituted court that imposes 
sentence on a person without due process of law. Both terms are derived 
from the name of Charles Lynch (1736–96), a Virginia planter and justice of 
the peace who, during the American Revolution, headed an irregular court 
formed to punish loyalists. 
 
                 Historically, the Vehmic courts of medieval Germany imposed 
some punishments that involved lynching, as did the Halifax gibbet law 
(execution of those guilty of theft valued over a specific amount) and 
Cowper justice (trial after execution) in the border districts of England. 
Resembling these cases were the Santa Hermandad constabulary in 
medieval Spain and pogroms directed against Jews in Russia and Poland, 
although 
in 
these 
cases 
there 
was 
support 
from 
legally constituted authorities.  

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022.

             The important thing about racial lynching and blasphemy is that they 
are forms of democratic violence and designed to assert majority dominance 
over the victims. Although the act of lynching itself is illegal, it has wide 
social acceptability and is framed in terms of vigilante justice. Vigilante 
justice has been practiced in many countries under unsettled conditions 
whenever informally organized groups have attempted to supplement or 
replace legal procedure or to fill the void where institutional justice did not 
yet exist.  
 
8.      Riot can be of two types, planned and unplanned, both require handling 
in different ways. Planned riot in terms of democratic violence pursuant to a 
political decision or in the form of social terrorism resorted to ventilate 
vengeance against blasphemous attempt, or a political decision or against a 
grave injustice. Such riot precedes a protest before it actually materialized 
therefore, more or less is in the form of informed decision to be tackled with 
care and caution for its proper prevention or at least management to lessen 
the miseries. Unplanned riots committed usually in a short socket which are 
difficult to prevent usually broke out at spur of the moment like in a factory, 
hospital, educational institution, in a village or during preventing a street 
crime and many other. To prove the individual offence during a rioting is 
one of the difficult tasks. Some private riots are also in place in our crime 
strategies, it is when more than five persons attack other party for 
commission of any offence and said riot is retaliated with the same force; 
such situation requires identification of parties as aggressor or aggressed 
upon so as to give premium, for exercising right of self defence, to diminish 
or vanish the criminal liability.  
              Lawyers and prosecutors say that the problems posed by riotous 
crime begin with the difficulty in determining, with the specificity and 
corroboration required for prosecution, who did what. Even when evidence 
is developed detailing an individual's participation amid the chaos of a mob, 
it can be much harder to fit his actions to the closely defined categories and 
degrees of criminal culpability than if he had committed a crime alone or as 
part of an extensively planned group action. Concepts like ''state of mind'' 
and ''acting in concert,'' often keys in determining guilt and challenging 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022.

enough to apply in orderly episodes, are even tougher in a tumultuous 
context. In those situations, things happen so fast and human perceptions are 
so imprecise that it's difficult to assign blame in a manner which permits a 
prosecutor to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt; on the defense side, 
there is a valid fear that prosecutors will charge people with minor 
participation in a serious event and because the judges sometimes are so 
outraged at the event, they will sweep those people into the guilty category. 
Burdens arise for prosecutors because ''the criminal law focuses on intent to 
commit a crime, and when a mob acts, in essence it becomes a beast with an 
intent of its own that is hard to attribute to any individual members. Basic 
problem is that the law evolved with the notion that crimes were committed 
by individuals or with the notion of conspiracy liability, and one can't really 
say that about people acting together in a mob. It's extremely hard to prove 
acting-in-concert in a mob situation. It means having a state of mind similar 
to or compatible with another person's that aims toward a criminal goal, and 
the actions must indicate there was this agreement, even a tacit one. 
                In order to prevent mob violence though police in their training 
centers teach the officers /trainees different subjects such as mob 
psychology, handling of vulnerable groups, negotiation skills, stress 
management and so on. In terms of field training, they are taught modern 
arrest techniques that need minimal use of force, use of anti-riot equipment, 
mob dispersal methods, first aid and evacuation procedures. We know even 
such trainings and modern equipment are not enough to control violent 
mobs. What is needed is the building of people’s trust in police and the 
country’s criminal justice system. The people take law in their hands because 
they think the culprits will go unpunished. The mobs are encouraged by the 
fact that hardly anybody involved in acts of collective violence is punished, 
and it is the perception that the bigger the number of people involved the 
safer they are from the law. 
9.       It is essential that by now a focus be made to collect evidence that 
could help to prove the offence of rioting; to achieve this end, it is necessary 
to see what requirements are in place in law/rules to prove an offence of

rioting. A course has been suggested in High Court Rules & Orders; relevant 
formation is reproduced as under; 
                          
                         
Chapter 4:  trial in riot cases 
              
High Court Rules & Orders Volume-III 
 
1. Careful handling required.-- Riots resulting in serious injuries or even death 
are of frequent occurrence in this Province, and cases relating to such riots require 
very careful handling. A large number of persons is generally involved and the 
evidence is often entirely of a partisan character. There is, moreover, great danger 
of innocent persons being implicated along with the guilty, owing to the tendency 
of the parties in such cases to try to implicate falsely as many of their enemies as 
they can. 
 
2. Court's duty to ascertain the true version.—The parties generally give 
widely divergent versions of the riot and in such cases the Police usually prosecute 
members of both the parties and place the divergent versions and the evidence in 
support thereof before the Court. It is for the Court to ascertain in such cases which 
of the two versions is correct and the Court cannot shirk this duty on the ground 
that the Police did not ascertain which of the stories was true. 
 
3. Right of self-defence.—When both parties deliberately engage in a fight no 
question of the right of self-defence arises. But, otherwise, the question as to 
which of the parties was the aggressor and which was acting in self-defence 
becomes of vital importance and the Court must do its best to arrive at a finding 
thereon for the party acting in self-defence cannot be held to be guilty of any 
offence unless the right of private defence is exceeded (see sections 96-106, 
Pakistan Penal Code.)  
 
4. Separate trials when both parties are prosecuted.-When both parties to a 
riot are prosecuted, the two cases must be tried separately and evidence in one 
case cannot be treated as evidence in the other, even with the consent of the 
parties. Similarly judgements in such cases should be written separately and the 
evidence in the one case should not be imported into the judgment in the other. 
Even when the Court is careful enough not to mix up the evidence, the mere fact 
of its having written one judgment furnishes the convicts with a ground of appeal. 
 
5. Case of each accused should be separately sifted.—In recording evidence in 
riot cases, care should be taken to bring out distinctly as far as possible the 
connection of each of the accused with the crime and the actual part played by 
him. In the judgment the evidence against each of the accused should be discussed 
separately along with the evidence produced by him in defence (if any), and 
should be scrutinized with care. The possibility of innocent persons being falsely 
implicated should be always borne in mind. The mention or omission of the name 
of an accused person in the First Information Report, when such report is made 
promptly by an eyewitness, and the presence or absence of injuries on his person 
are worthy of consideration in this respect, though these are, of course, by no 
means conclusive. 
 
6. An unlawful assembly, its common object and use of violence must be 
proved.—A charge of rioting presupposes the existence of an unlawful assembly 
with a common object as defined in section 141 of the Pakistan Penal Code. No 
charge of rioting can be sustained against any person unless it is proved that he 
was a member of such an unlawful assembly, and that one or more members of 
the assembly used force or violence in prosecution of its common object. It is, 
therefore, advisable to refer to the unlawful assembly, its common object, and the 
use of violence in the charge, so that the essential ingredients of the offence are 
not lost sight of.  
 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022. 
 
11
 
 
7. Joint liability of accused.- Section 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code, makes 
every member of an unlawful assembly constructively liable for offences 
committed by other members in prosecution of the common object of the 
assembly. If the number of offenders is ultimately found to be less than five, this 
section will not be applicable, but joint liability may still arise by virtue of section 
34 of the said Code, if it is found that the act constituting the offence was 
committed in `furtherance of the common intention of all'. When no joint liability 
can be established, each accused person can be held responsible for his own acts. 
(See 61 PR 1887, 52 ILR Cal. 197).  
 
8. Sentences when several offences are committed.- When a number of offences 
are committed by members of an unlawful assembly in the course of the riot in 
prosecution of their common object, each member is guilty not only of rioting but 
of every other offence committed by himself or by the 36 other members of the 
unlawful assembly. Under section 35 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he is 
liable to be punished separately for each of such offences, subject to the provisions 
of section 71 of the Pakistan Penal Code. Section 35 of the Criminal Procedure 
code enables the Court to make the sentences for two or more of such offences 
concurrent. The appropriate sentence in the case of each accused person must, of 
course, be determined in view of all the circumstances of the crime and the actual 
part played by him. (See 4 PR 1901) 
 
We know courts through precedents also throw light on nature of proof 
required to establish an offence committed during a mob violence; therefore, 
some precedents showing certain material as sufficient or otherwise, are 
given below for reference; 
“ABDUL ALIM alias ABDUL alias ABDUL AWAL AND 22 OTHERS versus THE 
STATE” (1971 P Cr.LJ 123):- 
 Importance of FIR; 
 
“In a case of mob violence like the present one much importance cannot be attached 
to the First Information Report though there are authorities which speak of the 
importance of the First Information Report being the first written information about 
the occurrence to the authority concerned. In this view of the matter, we find no 
substance in the contention of Mr. Abdus Salam Khan that the F. I. R: in the present 
case is not a bona fide and genuine document as regards the accused named 
therein.” 
Recognition and identification of the accused  
“Mr. Abdul Salam has argued that in a large-scale violence by a frenzy mob 
numbering 2000 or 3000, it is impossible to recognize which member of that frenzy 
mob was doing what and he (Mr. Abdus Salaam Khan) has further argued that in a 
case like this, T. I. parade ought to have been hold for identification of the accused. 
He has, therefore, contended that it is to be presumed that T. I. parade was not held 
because it was not possible for any one of the prosecution witnesses to identify any 
member out of that frenzy mob. We have already noticed that a large number of 
police officers and policemen were involved in the occurrence. They named some of 
the accused persons in their evidence and also correctly identified them. This shows 
that they know at least some by name as well as by face otherwise they could not 
name them at all. Moreover, their evidence does not stand alone. There is the 
evidence of local witnesses regarding the recognition of the accused as participants 
to the occurrence and assailants of the police party. There is hardly any force in the 
contention that the local witnesses did not know the accused specifically-named by 
them in their evidence and also identified them during the trial. If the assailants are 
known persons and recognised by name as well as by face, no question of T. I. 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022. 
 
12
 
 
parade arises at all: Though all the accused, appellants were not recognised by 
each of the witnesses to the occurrence or by the same number of witnesses, still the 
evidence regarding the recognition is quite reliable.  
 
“ALI RAZA alias PETER and others Versus The STATE and others” (2019 SCMR 
1982):- 
“What is established beyond doubt in the first crime report, is massive violence 
suffered by four individuals, though with a reticent reference to the robbers, two 
in number, without details/identities of those who lynched them shortly 
thereafter. Prosecution's complete silence on deaths and injuries as well as 
details collateral therewith occurring within same time and space, in the second 
First Information Report as well as during the trial, is most intriguing. Similarly, 
deceased' armed detour for a morning walk, on a motorbike, with undigested 
food in their stomachs, to be confronted by a mob, is a story that may not find a 
buyer. In the absence of whole truth, ". . . . . the Court must not be deterred by 
the incompleteness of the tale from drawing the inferences that properly flow 
from the evidence and circumstances" Syed Ali Bepari v. Nibaran Mollah and 
others (PLD 1962 SC 502). Available evidence on the record does not allow any 
hypothesis to substitute anyone else, being responsible for the first incident other 
than the deceased of the present case, subsequently fallen prey to the wrath of a 
mob with the appellants being at the helm. Defense objection on the admission 
of forensic evidence, establishing appellants' identity as well as participation in 
the crime does not hold much water.” 
“In the totality of circumstances, given appellants' different backgrounds, in a 
limited time space, interpolation, substitution or editing of forensic material, 
seemingly immune from human interference, could not have been possibly 
manipulated and thus constitutes a piece of evidence too formidable to be shaken 
through a bald assertion alone, therefore we entertain no manner of doubt that 
the appellants are responsible for what befell upon the deceased and thus 
notwithstanding the enormity of their own conduct the appellants cannot be 
exonerated for their recourse to violence upon the deceased. Prosecution of 
offences, to the exclusion of all others, is a State prerogative and sentencing the 
offenders is a judicial province. Accused of most heinous or gruesome offence is 
entitled as of right, to a fair trial by a tribunal designated by law with a 
meaningful opportunity to vindicate and defend his position both before the 
prosecuting authority as well as the Court. Collective human wisdom, since 
times immemorial has not been able to evolve a better or more humane 
procedure to prosecute and convict offenders other than due process of law, with 
procedural safeguards under Constitutional guarantee of fair trial, to hand 
down sentences mandated thereunder on the preponderance of legal evidence, 
without compromising on the principle of inherent human dignity. Retributive 
torture, that too by mobs through street justice, would not only have most de-
humanizing impact on our society but also triggers chaos and anarchy as is 
evident in the present case besides being violative of Constitutional mandate. 
Vendetta cannot equate itself with justice. It is devoid of solemnity inherent in 
the process of law, leaving an offender as a victim, an object of sympathy at the 
end of the day, without judicial certainty about his guilt, therefore the appellants 
cannot be allowed to go scot free without a tag.” 
 
“BABA JAN versus The STATE” (2016 YLR 88):- 
 
The occurrence is basically of the offences of sections 147, 148, 149, 427, 436, 353 
and 448, P.P.C. Prosecution story shows that about 700 or 800 persons gathered 
in front of United Bank (UBL) or Karakuram Cooperative Bank (KCBL) Aliabad 
Hunza, turned into an illegal mob entailing to the occurrence. Very strangely, the 
learned trial court has convicted appellant although none of the PWs are charging 
the appellant for any of the above offences. In a case of rioting by a mob, every 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022. 
 
13
 
 
member of the mob is responsible for the occurrence, while in the case in hand, the 
learned trial court has accepted selection of appellant for trial, by the prosecution. 
In such a case, to sustain a conviction for rioting, it is essential for prosecution first 
to prove the existence of an unlawful assembly with a common object and then to 
prove that one or more members of the assembly used violence or force in 
furtherance of the common object. The prosecution evidence is silent about the 
common object of the alleged rioters. None of the above PWs are stating about any 
kind of common object of the rioters. None of the PWs have charged appellant for 
any of the offences of above sections. The PWs, who have even charged the 
appellant, have stated about mere presence of the appellant in the mob. Mere 
presence of the appellant at the place of occurrence is never sufficient to prove that 
he shared the common object of the unlawful assembly. The provisions of the above 
referred sections do not require conviction and punishment merely on the basis of 
only presence or identification of the appellant as member of the mob. None of the 
PWs have stated that appellant did any act amounting to offence of any of the above 
sections. 
 
“MUHAMMAD AZAD AND 6 OTHERS versus THE STATE” (1970 SCMR 780) 
 
“It is noteworthy that these three witnesses have not said a word about the rest of 
the incident, or of the manner in which any other person on the prosecution side 
came by his injuries. From this circumstance, two conclusions may be justifiably 
drawn. The first is that these witnesses are not touched to any appreciable extent 
by the conflict between the two voting camps which developed into hostilities on this 
occasion. Secondly, their evidence makes it plain that despite the description given 
of the incident in the initial report, the assaults which took place including those 
which have been made the subject matter of convictions in the present case were 
not part of a general attack by several hundred persons on several hundred other 
persons, but are to be regarded as sporadic or isolate assaults which occurred at 
some distance from the polling station, and perhaps on the fringes of the front 
between the two opposing groups.” 
 
“…………The contention that these six persons can only be held responsible on the 
evidence, for the consequences of their individual acts is obviously untenable, since 
the attacks upon Tikka Khan, Abdul Aziz and Bhag Ali are clearly proved to have 
been the concerted work of the persons who have been named above, acting in 
groups. The application of section 149, P. P. C. in the circumstance of the case may 
not be entirely appropriate, for, as has been seen already, the indications are that 
the injuries of the individual members of the complainant-party were not the result 
of a massed attack by four hundred persons on four hundred others, but the attacks 
on these persons were included in a number of sporadic assaults, and they cannot 
be regarded safely otherwise than in isolation from each other. But joint 
responsibility of the nature for which provision is made in section 34, P. P. C. 
clearly attaches to those who joined in the attack upon a particular individual, to 
the extent that his injuries were the reasonable and natural consequence of the 
attack.” 
 
“SRI JAGADISH DEORI vs The STATE OF ASSAM” (Crl.A.No.177/2016, 
Crl.A.No.329/2018, Crl.A.7/2019, Crl.A.(J)89/2019 and Crl.A.(J) 90/2019. 
92. 
Reverting back to this case it is held that common intention to assault 
could be inferred from the conduct of the mob. The mob stormed into the courtyard 
of the deceased and pulled him out along with his wife and sons. It could be 
deciphered that the appellants who were also members of the mob, at least, had the 
common intention to assault the injured persons and the deceased. It is worth 
reiterating that no contradictions could be elicited through the cross-examination 
of PW-2 and PW-3 to rebut their evidence that they were assaulted by the 
appellants. It has already been held in the foregoing discussions that the FIR was 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022. 
 
14
 
 
lodged by a family member who was not present in the place of occurrence and so 
the names of the appellants were not mentioned in the FIR. 
93. In the instant case PWs-2, 3, 7 and 9 have clearly identified the appellants who 
were present in the dock while they were facing trial. The other witnesses have also 
identified the appellants who were present in the dock. PW- 2, PW-3 and the 
deceased were relentlessly attacked by a large mob. They could very well identify 
the appellants who were co-villagers, but it is next to impossible for them to 
specifically describe each and every blow and the weapon used at the time of the 
incident. It is not humanly possible that the witnesses could remember vividly which 
appellant assaulted on what part of the body. Evidence of an injured witness must 
ordinarily be ranked high. 
State of U.P vs Dan Singh,(SC). 1998 (1) CLJ (Criminal) 18. 
With respect to existence of unlawful assembly, it was held; 
“It is possible that there was no unlawful assembly in existence at the time when 
the `doli' was stopped. Nevertheless, as per the evidence of all the eye witnesses, a 
large number of villagers had gathered there and they had with them lathis and 
sticks. According to the explanation to Section 141 I.P.C. and assembly which is 
not unlawful when it assembles may subsequently become an unlawful assembly. As 
observed by this Court in Lalji & Ors. Vs. State of U.P., 1989(1) SCC 437 "that 
common object of the unlawful assembly can be gathered form the nature of the 
assembly, arms used by them and the behaviour of the assembly at or before the 
scene of occurrence. It is an inference to be deduced from the facts and 
circumstances of each case". What has happened in the present case is precisely 
what has envisaged in the explanation to Section 141 I.P.C. With Khima Nand being 
injured, all hell broke loose. A cry was raised that the doms should be burnt and 
killed, and this is precisely what happened. the marriage party was assaulted by the 
villagers. Six of the members of the marriage party were burnt, five of them having 
been locked inside the house of the only Dom resident of the village whose house 
was also burnt. Eight others were pursued and then mercilessly beaten and were 
killed elsewhere in the village. We fail to appreciate how anyone, under the 
circumstances, can possibly come to the conclusion that an unlawful assembly 
having the common object of killing the Doms did not exist when fourteen people 
have been killed without the use of any weapon more lethal than a stick or stone. 
Considering the number of injuries on the persons who had died, it is evident that 
a large number of persons must have taken part in the assault.  
Tracking the members of unlawful assembly 
This brings us to the next question as to who were the persons who were members 
of this unlawful assembly. it is no doubt true that some of the villagers may have 
been present at the time of the occurrence who were mere spectators and could not 
be regarded as being members of the unlawful assembly. It also happens, when 
people are killed during a riot, there may be a possibility of the incident being 
exaggerated or some innocent persons being named as being part of the assailants 
party. This may happen wittingly or unwittingly. But just because there may be some 
inconsequential contradictions or exaggeration in the testimony of the eye witnesses 
that should not be a ground to reject their evidence in its entirety. In the cases of 
rioting, where there are a large number of assailants and a number of witnesses, it 
is but natural that the testimony of the witnesses may not be identical. What has to 
be seen is whether the basic features of the occurrences have been Before we deal 
with the testimony of these witnesses, it will be important to bear in mind that in the 
present case the conviction is being sought under Section 302 I.P.C. with the aid of 
Section 149 I.P.C.. The two essential ingredients of this Section are that there must 
be a commission of an offence by any member of unlawful assembly and that such 
offence must be committed in prosecution of common object of that assembly or 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022. 
 
15
 
 
must be such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed. It 
is also a well-settled law (see Masalti Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1965 SC 202) 
that it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove which of the members of the 
unlawful assembly did which or what act. In fact as observed in Lalji's case (supra) 
"while overt act and active participation may indicate common intention of the 
person perpetrating the crime, the mere presence in the unlawful assembly may 
fasten vicariously criminal liability under Section 149". 
Mr. Lalit is right in submitting that the witnesses would be revengeful as a large-
scale violence had taken place where the party, to which the eye witnesses belonged, 
had suffered and it is, therefore, necessary to fix the identity and participation of 
each accused with reasonable certainty. Dealing with a similar case of riot where 
a large number of assailants who were members of an unlawful assembly committed 
an offence of murder in pursuance of a common object, the manner in which the 
evidence should be appreciated was adverted upon by this court in Masalti's case 
(supra) at page 210 as follows: 
"Then it is urged that the evidence given by the witnesses conforms to the same 
uniform pattern and since no specific part is assigned to all the assailants, 
that evidence should not have been accepted. This criticism again is not well 
founded. where a crowd of assailants who are members of an unlawful 
assembly proceeds to commit an offence of murder in pursuance of the 
common object of the unlawful assembly, it is often not possible for witnesses 
to describe accurately the part played by each one of the assailants. Besides, 
if a large crowd of persons armed with weapons assaults the intended victims, 
it may not be necessary that all of them have to take part in the actual assault. 
In the present case, for instance, several weapons were carried by different 
members of the unlawful assembly, but it appears that the guns were used and 
that was enough to kill 5 persons. In such a case, it would be unreasonable to 
contend that because the other weapons carried by the members of the 
unlawful assembly were not used, the story in regard to the said weapons itself 
should be rejected. Appreciation of evidence in such a complex case is not 
doubt a difficult task; but criminal courts have to do their best in dealing with 
such cases and it is their duty to sift the evidence carefully and decide which 
part of it is true and which is not." 
One more principle which was laid down in Masalti's case (supra), and which 
would be applicable here, is that where a "court has to deal with the evidence 
pertaining to the commission of an offence involving a large number of offenders 
and a large number of victims, it is usual to adopt the test that the conviction could 
be sustained only if it is supported by 2/3 or more witnesses who give a consistent 
account of the incident. In a sense the test may be described as mechanical; but it 
cannot be treated as irrational or unreasonable". 
Tribhuvan Nath vs State, (Delhi) (DB) 1995 CriLJ 1215. 
(18) The short question which arises for consideration is whether the appellants 
could be treated to be members of the said mob which was having the unlawful 
object of murdering the Sikhs and looting and arousing their shops and houses. 
From the testimony of Public Witness 1 and Public Witness 2, it is apparent that the 
appellants had come to ask the Sikhs residing in the locality to cut their hair so that 
they may not be noticed as Sikhs who could be the targets of the unruly mob which 
might come and kill the Sikhs. If that is so, it is not possible to agree with the 
inference drawn by the learned Additional Sessions Judge that when the actual 
rioting mob came at about 3.30 P.M. and assaulted the Sikhs, these appellants also 
became members of the mob sharing the said unlawful object of the said mob. After 
all, no overt act has been imputed to the appellants by Public Witness 1 and Public 
Witness 2 that the appellants had either instigated the mob or had led the mob or 
had performed any other act which could show that when the mob came, which 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022. 
 
16
 
 
assaulted Himmat Singh, these appellants came to share their common unlawful 
object of the said mob. There is no statement made by these Public Witness 1 and 
Public Witness 2 that the appellants had indulged in any rioting, arousing or looting 
of the properties and valuables of the Sikhs. 
(19) Mere presence of appellants in the mob at the time the mob came, in our view, 
would riot lead to any inference that the appellants had become members of the 
said mob sharing the unlawful objects of the said mob. 
(20) In Bishambar Bhagat Vs. The State of Bihar, it was held that mere presence of 
a person at the place where the members of an unlawful assembly have gathered 
for carrying out their illegal common object does not incriminate him but the 
question is one of fact in each case as to whether a person happens to be innocently 
present at the place of occurrence or was actually a member of the unlawful 
assembly. 
(21) Similarly in Mutha Naicker Vs. State of Tamil Nadu, , the Supreme Court held 
that whenever in uneventful rural society something unusual occurs, more so where 
the local community is faction ridden and a fight occurs amongst factions, a good 
number of people appear on the scene not with a view to participating in the 
occurrence but as curious spectators. In such an event, mere presence in the 
unlawful assembly should not be treated as leading to the conclusion that the person 
concerned was present in the unlawful assembly as a member of the unlawful 
assembly. 
(22) Same ratio had been repeated by the Supreme Court in case of Ghanshyam Vs. 
State of Uttar Pradesh. 
10.     To further dilate upon the requirement of evidence and the defences, it 
is necessary to throw in light some facts and sort of material to be collected 
and attended during the course of investigation or trial.  
• In case of planned or unplanned riot, police can resort to powers available 
under sections 127 to 131-A of Cr.P.C. to disperse unlawful assembly 
and can also claim protection u/s 132 Cr. P.C. against an offence if 
committed by the police during such prevention. In a somewhat similar 
situations, powers are also regulated u/s 4 & 5 of the Anti-terrorism Act, 
1997. Police can also claim exoneration pursuant to section 76, 79, 80 or 
81 of PPC (general exceptions) and shelter under Article 172 of Police 
Order, 2002. In all such situations, action in good faith as defined u/s 52 
of PPC is to be proved by the police. 
 
• For prevention of planned riot, a tactical plan should be arranged so that 
all law enforcement officials and officers are well acquainted with 
transportation facilities, its routes, communication procedures and 
command & control personnels in headquarters. copy of such 
Notifications/orders must be made available with reports u/s 173 Cr. P.C. 
 
• To identify the protesters or the members of unlawful assembly, police 
can use coloured water guns and can make available images or videos 
for its use as evidence before the court. Though it is difficult to install 
CCTV cameras at the site of agitation yet like devices can be used to 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022. 
 
17
 
 
video graph the episode of agitation. Such video clips can be retrieved 
from the system with the help of forensic experts as per requirement of 
law and evidence in the form of photogrammetry test can be made 
available.  
 
• Where there is government installed CCTV camera, like as under Safe 
City Authority Act, the footages can be collected from concerned office 
after observance of full protocols under the law.  
 
• Similar process for obtaining digital evidence can be resorted to if 
available in any forms like event video graphed by general public 
through any cell phone or by media men after converting it into 
admissible format of evidence. So much so videos relating to events, 
displayed on air through TV channels or social media can also be made 
available as evidence after obtaining it from PEMRA through a formal 
process sanctioned by law.  
 
• The police should be instructed for the use of Polaroid cameras (which 
should be made available to them) to photograph arrestees and arresting 
officers at the time of arrest. When arrestees are being processed prior to 
arraignment, at least two pictures of the arrestee should be taken; one for 
the police records and the second to accompany the court papers in order 
to eliminate identification problems in court if the arrestee gave a false 
name. 
 
• Instructions should be issued that notations should be made on the 
photographs regarding time, place, and circumstances of the arrest. 
Names of news media photographers should be noted so that their 
photographs and video-tapes will be available for use at the time of trial. 
 
• Transportation personnel should be instructed not to accept an arrestee 
without an accompanying photograph and the name of the arresting 
officer. 
 
• Law enforcement officers should be equipped with tape recorders and 
bull horns, particularly if the demonstration is a non-violent one. This 
can be of great value in preserving warnings given at the scene for future 
use in court. Furthermore, to prevent or minimize injury, the bull horn 
can be used to warn demonstrators of intent to use tear gas or the 
chemical MACE. 
 
• Law enforcement officers can familiarize themselves with the 
appropriate statutory offences, which are usually committed during a 
riot, in consultation with the prosecution office well in advance so as to 
meet pre-charge procedures for collection of required evidence.  
 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022. 
 
18
 
 
• Conspiracy evidence of such rioting is also required during the trial for 
making chain of events intact which could be made available, apart from 
other methods, with the sanction as mentioned in Investigation for Fair 
Trial Act, 2003. 
 
• Public notice/demonstration by the police to call for any information or 
evidence with respect to commission of such offence in order to prove 
the source of information open or privileged, and copy of such notice be 
tendered in evidence.  
11. 
Coming back to the case in hand, as shall be seen from the above 
narration of facts, according to the prosecution case itself the mob consisted 
of about 2000/2500 persons and in order to establish the ocular account eight 
prosecution witnesses namely Naveed Mumtaz DSP (PW-3), Muhammad 
Rizwan Constable (PW-5), Muhammad Kashif Constable (PW-6), Ghulam 
Mohy-ud-Din Inspector (PW-7), Baqa Muhammad Constable (PW-8), 
Muhammad Arif HC (PW-9), Muhammad Khan SI (PW-12) and 
Muhammad Nawaz Inspector (PW-16) were assigned the duty to pin point, 
nominate and assign the roles to the accused. While going through the 
statements of above witnesses it has been observed that only three 
prosecution witnesses have named Fayyaz Ahmad and five have nominated 
Muhammad Shahzad to be the members of the mob, with no further 
specification about their role. In a situation portrayed by the prosecution, it 
was near to impossibility that amongst such a huge number of perpetrators 
the witnesses could identify these accused/ appellants; while observing so, 
we are influenced by the fact that none from the mob was arrested at the spot 
who could have helped the prosecution to point out and name the persons 
from the crowd and further it was also not brought on the file through the 
statements of any of such witnesses that the accused who were nominated by 
them, had any criminal credentials or otherwise, they were known to the 
witnesses prior to the occurrence. On these particulars lines the prosecution 
witnesses were cross-examined by the defence and it came to light that none 
of these witnesses were the residents of the locality, they had no business or 
property in the said area and some of these witnesses in clear terms admitted 
that the accused persons who had been named by them were not familiar to 
them prior to the occurrence and they also could not disclose the source from 
where they knew the names of the accused appellants. Though, one of the 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022. 
 
19
 
 
witnesses namely Khan Muhammad SI (PW-12) tried to explain that one 
Saboor Press Reporter had taken the footages and with the  help of said 
footages the people of the area and other accused had named the assailants, 
but if this plea is admitted then said Saboor Press Reporter could be the best 
witness in the hands of the prosecution, but neither said Press Reporter was 
shown any where in the FIR nor was produced in the witness box to lend 
corroboration to the prosecution case.  
12. 
   We are conscious of the fact that ocular account was sought to be 
corroborated through CD as well as photographs by Abdul Saboor, a Press 
Reporter and according to some of the prosecution witnesses this was the 
source by which they could identify the assailants and there is no cavil to the 
proposition that Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 as well as 
provisions of Electronic Transactions Ordinance (LI of 2002) have 
smoothened the procedure to receive such evidence subject to 
restrictions/limitation provided therein as held in the case “ALI RAZA alias 
PETER and others versus The STATE and others” (2019 SCMR 1982), but 
as observed above said Abdul Saboor was neither joined in the investigation 
process nor was produced in the dock. So much so, these pieces of evidence 
were not sealed into parcels and no forensic test was got conducted to know 
that such CD/photographs were of such items and contained genuine or 
edited material.  
13. 
Keeping in mind the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, even 
if we believe the entire prosecution case with regard to different step by step 
modes of occurrence, the brutality unleashed by the mob, irrespective of the 
fact that it may be unplanned or without premeditation, has devastating 
impact on the society and also plays a vital role in tarnishing overall image 
of the country in the whole world. Having said that, primarily it would 
remain the obligation of the prosecution to establish the charge in such a 
manner that all hypotheses about the innocence of the culprits are vanished 
and the right of every accused to fair trial shall always remain the hallmark. 
In this respect, we would like to reproduce the relevant portion from the 
judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the above-referred Ali 
Raza’s case (2019 SCMR 1982), which reads as under: - 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022. 
 
20
 
 
Prosecution of offences, to the exclusion of all others, is a State prerogative and 
sentencing the offenders is a judicial province. Accused of most heinous or 
gruesome offence is entitled as of right, to a fair trial by a tribunal designated by 
law with a meaningful opportunity to vindicate and defend his position both before 
the prosecuting authority as well as the Court. Collective human wisdom, since 
times immemorial has not been able to evolve a better or more humane procedure 
to prosecute and convict offenders other than due process of law, with procedural 
safeguards under Constitutional guarantee of fair trial, to hand down sentences 
mandated thereunder on the preponderance of legal evidence, without 
compromising on the principle of inherent human dignity. Retributive torture, that 
too by mobs through street justice, would not only have most de-humanizing impact 
on our society but also triggers chaos and anarchy as is evident in the presence 
case besides being violative of Constitutional mandate. Vendetta cannot equate 
itself with justice. It is devoid of solemnity inherent in the process of law, leaving 
an offender as a victim, an objection of sympathy at the end of the day, without 
judicial certainty about his guilt….” 
In the instant case, it is manifest that in series of events the occurrence 
triggered the outrage, instantaneously swaying upon the accused, otherwise, 
having no motive or axe to grind. It is this spontaneity whereunder the mob 
resorted to violence seemingly without premeditation. In such a situation, 
even if the occurrence is believed as it has been tabled by the prosecution, 
the important and foremost question was the identity of the accused persons, 
but here in this case the prosecution failed to establish the identity of the 
accused appellants either by the testimonies of ocular account or by any other 
means.

Last but not the least, on the same set of evidence, co-accused namely 
Muhammad Adil, Mubashir Fazal alias Chand, Muhammad Tariq, 
Muhammad Rafiq, Muhammad Asghar, Muhammad Tufail, Rasheed 
Ahmad, Muhammad Ehsan, Maqsood-ul-Hassan, Altaf Hussain and 
Muhammad Ejaz, whose cases were not different from the case of present 
accused appellants have already earned acquittal from this Court through 
judgment passed in Criminal Appeals bearing Nos.224/2022, 225/2022, 
252/2022 & 259/2022; thus in addition to the fact that on merits the 
prosecution 
could 
not 
establish 
its 
case 
against 
the 
present 
accused/appellants, they are also entitled to get benefit of the principle of 
“falsus in uno falsus in omnibus” (false in one thing, false in all). Reliance 
is placed on the cases reported as “Notice to Police Constable Khizar Hayat son of 
Hadait Ullah” (PLD 2019 SC 527) and “PERVAIZ KHAN and another versus The 
STATE” (2022 SCMR 393). 

 
Criminal Appeal No.654.2022.

15. 
For what has been discussed above, in the instant case the prosecution 
has totally failed to establish the charge against the accused/appellants 
beyond any shadow of doubt and it is trite that to extend benefit of doubt to 
an accused person, it is not necessary that there should be several 
circumstances creating doubt, rather one reasonable doubt is sufficient to 
acquit an accused. Reliance is placed on the cases reported as “MUHAMMAD 
MANSHA versus The STATE” (2018 SCMR 772) and “MUHAMMAD IMRAN versus 
The STATE” (2020 SCMR 857). Consequently, criminal appeal is allowed and 
the accused/appellants are acquitted of the charges. They shall be released 
forthwith if not required in any other case. The case property, if any, shall be 
disposed of in accordance with law and the record of the trial court be sent 
back immediately.
