Malik Altaf Nawaz, Advocate, for the Petitioner. 
 
Mr. Javed Iqbal, Assistant District Public Prosecutor, with 
Muhammad Khan/SP, Ashraf/Inspector, Khalid Aslam/SI, 
Fayyaz Mehmood/SI, Ghulam Rasool/SI, and Muhammad 
Riaz/SI. 
 
 
  
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Through this application, the 
Petitioner seeks post-arrest bail in case FIR No.758/2023 dated 24.9.2023 
registered at Police Station Saddar Bahawalnagar for an offence under 
section 9(1)-3(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 
(“CNSA”). 
2. 
 
According to the FIR, the prosecution case is that on 
24.9.2023 around 12:40 p.m., Muhammad Shakir/ASI (the Complainant) 
was present at the Sikandar Canal Bridge, Arifwala Road, alongwith other 
officials, including Maria 1142/LC. During this time, they observed a 
woman heading towards Kora Khoo, carrying a plastic bag in her right 
hand. Upon noticing the presence of police, the woman attempted to flee, 
which made the Complainant suspicious. He apprehended her with the 
help of his colleagues. The woman identified herself as Kousar Bibi (the 
Petitioner). The Complainant inspected her plastic bag and discovered 
1420 grams of charas, scissors, and Watak money totalling Rs. 480/-. 
3. 
 
On 01.11.2023, the Petitioner’s father, Muhammad Sarwar, 
filed a complaint (Tracking No. 4197459) with the Superintendent of 
Police, Internal Accountability Branch, Bahawalpur Region. He alleged 
that on 07.09.2016, Fayyaz Mehmood, who was serving as Assistant  
Sub-Inspector at Police Station Saddar Bahawalnagar at the time, 
unlawfully arrested his son Muhammad Mustafa and brother Muhammad 
Arshad, and confined them in the police station’s lockup. Sarwar claimed 
that he filed a habeas petition in the Sessions Court, which appointed a 

Crl. Misc. No.5175/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
 
bailiff who successfully recovered Mustafa and Arshad. The Sessions 
Judge was inclined to impose a fine of Rs. 2000/- on Fayyaz Mehmood, 
who apologized, upon which Sarwar withdrew his petition, and the court 
set the detenues at liberty. 
4. 
 
After some time, Fayyaz Mehmood was transferred. 
Subsequently, he was promoted to Sub-Inspector and recently posted at 
Police Station Saddar Bahawalnagar again. He harboured a grudge of the 
2016 incident. One afternoon, he allegedly sent a man in plain clothes who 
trespassed Sarwar’s house by scaling the wall. Sarwar’s family members 
noticed the intruder and apprehended him after a scuffle, during which he 
sustained injuries from a falling brick from an under-construction wall. 
The individual identified himself as ASI Muhammad Murtaza. Sarwar 
further claimed that shortly afterwards, the local police raided his house 
and arrested all men and women, including the Petitioner, and also took 
away cash, cellphones, gold ornaments, motorcycles, a car, and other 
valuables. Subsequently, they registered seven cases against the arrested 
persons (allegedly FIR No.758/2023, supra, is among them). 
5. 
 
The Superintendent of Police, IAB, referred Sarwar’s above-
mentioned complaint to DSP Jawad Sakha. He conducted an inquiry and 
found the allegations against police officials correct and recommended 
legal action against them. The concluding paragraph of his report dated 
20.12.2023 is as follows:

Sarwar had also sent a copy of the above-mentioned 
complaint to the Inspector General of Police Punjab (IGP), following 

Crl. Misc. No.5175/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
 
which the District Police Officer (DPO) Bahawalnagar conducted an 
independent inquiry. He found against Sarwar.  
7. 
 
On 31.1.2024, vide Letter No.379/PCC, the IGP directed that 
“de novo inquiry be conducted at IAB Hqrs”, due to the conflicting 
findings of the two inquiries mentioned above – one conducted by DSP 
Jawad Sakha and the other by the DPO Bahawalnagar. The report of this 
inquiry is awaited.  
8. 
 
The Assistant District Public Prosecutor has apprised this 
Court that a cross-version has been recorded in FIR No. 758/2023 
following Sarwar’s complaint. However, he has stated that the accused 
party does not enjoy a good reputation in the locality. They are known as 
drug dealers and criminals who resist law enforcement when authorities 
try to take any action against them. Additionally, several criminal cases 
involving narcotics and other offences are pending against various 
members of the Petitioner’s family. 
9. 
 
Although the IGP has directed a de novo inquiry into 
Sarwar’s complaint dated 01.11.2023, the fact is that DSP Jawad Sakha 
found his allegations correct. The Superintendent of Police, IAB, 
Bahawalpur Region, endorsed his findings when he forwarded his report 
to the IGP under the cover of his Letter No.1581/IAB/BWP dated 
21.12.2023. The S.P. also enclosed a draft charge sheet against the 
delinquent police officers with the said letter. It is, therefore, a case of two 
versions, falling within the ambit of section 497(2) Cr.P.C. Further inquiry 
is required to determine the Petitioner’s guilt. 
10. 
 
Admittedly, the Petitioner does not have a criminal record. 
The list of cases submitted by the Law Officer pertains to the Petitioner’s 
family members – not her. She cannot be penalized for the wrongdoing of 
her relatives. 
11. 
 
In view of the above, this application is allowed. The 
Petitioner is admitted to post-arrest bail subject to her furnishing bail bond 
in the sum of Rs.500,000/- (Rupees five hundred thousand) with two 
sureties in the like amount to the trial court’s satisfaction. 
12. 
 
I need to include an additional note before concluding this 
order. 

Crl. Misc. No.5175/B/2023

Pakistan is a signatory to several international conventions 
related to narcotics control, including the Single Convention on Narcotic 
Drugs (1961), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971), and 
the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic 
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988).1 By signing these 
international Conventions, Pakistan has committed to aligning its 
domestic narcotics control laws and policies with the objectives and 
principles outlined therein. This includes promoting adherence to legal 
and ethical standards, transparency, and accountability in all law 
enforcement activities related to narcotics control, including the processes 
of recovery and seizure.  
14. 
 
The aforementioned Conventions must be read in tandem 
with international human rights treaties such as the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, which obligate the States to respect and protect the rights of 
individuals, including those suspected or accused of drug offences. Law 
enforcement activities related to narcotics control must be conducted in 
accordance with these human rights standards, ensuring that individuals 
are treated with dignity, afforded due process, and protected from arbitrary 
detention, torture, or other forms of ill-treatment. 
15. 
 
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) 
has developed guidelines and recommendations to promote transparency 
and accountability in law enforcement activities, including publishing 
data on drug seizures, investigations, and prosecutions. The UNODC 
encourages States to establish independent oversight mechanisms to 
monitor law enforcement agencies and hold them accountable for their 
actions. 
                                                 
1 These treaties and conventions, along with the following and others, form the framework for international efforts to 
combat the production, trafficking, and abuse of narcotics and psychotropic substances: 
1. International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) Regulations: These regulations complement the international drug 
control treaties by providing guidelines for the licit production, distribution, and use of narcotic drugs and 
psychotropic substances. 
2. United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, 2000: While not specific to narcotics, this 
convention includes provisions related to combating drug trafficking as part of its broader aim to address 
organized crime. 
3. United Nations Convention Against Corruption, 2003: This convention includes measures to prevent corruption 
in law enforcement and judicial systems, which are crucial for effective narcotics control. 
4. United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on Drugs: These sessions provide a platform for 
member states to discuss and develop strategies to address the global drug problem, including measures to reduce 
demand, prevent drug abuse, and enhance international cooperation.

16. 
 
In conclusion, while international Conventions on narcotics 
control call for strict measures to combat drug trafficking and abuse, it is 
essential to prioritize human rights, due process, transparency, 
accountability, and ethical standards. By upholding these principles, 
governments can effectively address the challenges posed by narcotics 
while safeguarding individual liberties, promoting the rule of law, and 
preserving the integrity of law enforcement institutions. 
17. 
 
In Pakistan, complaints of false implication in criminal cases 
are quite frequent. Addressing this issue requires multifaceted actions, 
including legal reforms and increased transparency and accountability in 
investigations. 
18. 
 
Videography is a powerful tool in the fight against false 
implication in narcotics cases, providing objective documentation of 
police encounters, supporting criminal investigations, and fostering 
transparency and accountability within law enforcement agencies. By 
capturing audio and video footage of interactions between officers and 
individuals suspected of drug-related offences, video recordings offer a 
reliable record of events that can help prevent wrongful arrests, unjust 
prosecutions, and violations of individuals’ rights. 
19. 
 
Furthermore, the data collected from video recordings can be 
harnessed to identify patterns and trends within law enforcement agencies, 
enabling policymakers to discern areas for improvement in officer 
training, policies, and procedures. By analyzing the footage, authorities 
can identify systemic issues, such as biased policing practices or 
procedural shortcomings, and implement targeted interventions to address 
them effectively. It is, however, essential to acknowledge the challenges 
and limitations associated with the use of videography. Privacy concerns 
may arise, particularly regarding recording bystanders or individuals not 
involved in the incident. Additionally, there may be technical and 
logistical challenges related to the storage, access, and use of video 
footage, which must be addressed through clear policies and procedures. 
20. 
 
The Supreme Court of India has acknowledged the 
importance of videography in Shafhi Mohammad v. State of Himachal 
Pradesh [(2018) 5 SCC 311]. It stated: 

Crl. Misc. No.5175/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
 
“We are in agreement with the Report of the Committee of Experts that 
videography of crime scene during investigation is of immense value  
in improving administration of criminal justice. A Constitution Bench  
of this Court in Karnail Singh v. State of Haryana, (2018) 5 SCC 311 
(2009) 8 SCC 539 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 887, noted that technology is  
an important part in the system of police administration. It has also been 
noted in the decisions quoted in the earlier part of this order that new 
techniques and devices have evidentiary advantages, subject to the 
safeguards to be adopted. Such techniques and devices are the order of 
the day. Technology is a great tool in investigation. By the  
videography, crucial evidence can be captured and presented in a 
credible manner.”  
21. 
 
In Zahid Sarfaraz Gill v. The State (Criminal Petition No. 
1192 of 2023 (decided on 22.11.2023),2 the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
also underscored the critical importance of video recording during the 
recovery and seizure process, in cases involving narcotics. It was observed 
that the ANF personnel or policemen who conduct the operation have cell 
phones with a built-in camera that they can use to record and/or take 
photographs of the search, seizure, and arrest. The Supreme Court noted 
that while section 25 of the CNSA excludes the applicability of section 
103 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which requires the presence of 
respectable inhabitants during a search, there is no bar on video recording 
or photography during such operations. Article 164 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984, explicitly permits the use of evidence obtained through 
modern devices or techniques, and Article 165 thereof supersedes all other 
laws in this regard. The Supreme Court emphasized the necessity for 
officers to use video cameras to record the entire operation, including the 
presence of witnesses and suspects. This measure, the Court stated, is 
essential to prevent any allegations of misconduct or foul play during the 
proceedings, as a deterrent against false accusations and to ensure the 
integrity of the collected evidence. The relevant excerpt is reproduced 
below: 
“It is time that all institutions act professionally and use all available 
lawful means to obtain evidence. A credible prosecution and 
adjudication process also improves public perception. We expect that 
all concerned will attend to these matters with the attention that they 
demand because the menace of narcotic substances in society has far-
reaching consequences: destroying entire households, creating societal 
problems and casting a heavy financial burden on the State when drug 
addicts are required to be treated. Moreover, research indicates that 
drug addicts resort to all methods to obtain drugs, including committing 
crimes.”

The Director General ANF has already approved SOPs for 
recording footage during raids/operations, seizure at airports, seaports, dry 
ports, international mail offices, courier/parcel offices, permanent 
checkposts and random Nakas. These were circulated by the Government 
of Pakistan, Ministry of Narcotics Control, HQ Anti-Narcotics Force,

It is time that the Punjab Police should also be equipped with 
advance technological tools to foster public trust, facilitate investigations, 
and support court proceedings. Therefore, the Government is directed to 
provide body-worn and dashboard cameras to the Punjab Police on a 
priority basis, preferably within six months. Simultaneously, it shall frame 
SOPs to preserve and use footage recorded by them. 
24. 
 
Given the significant technological advancements, most 
police officers carry smartphones, which they can use to videograph their 
raids/operations. It is, therefore, directed as follows: 
(i) 
Henceforth, leaders of every police team shall ensure 
that 
all 
operations 
are 
videographed 
without 
exception. Specifically, in cases involving recovery of 
narcotics, they shall record a video of the entire 
operation unless circumstances beyond their control 
prevent them from doing so. 
(ii) 
Reasons for failing to record the recovery proceedings 
on video must be specifically documented in the case 
diary. 
25. 
 
The Punjab Safe Cities Authority has been established under 
Act I of 2016 for the construction, development and maintenance of an 
integrated command, control and communication (IC3) system for police 
in major cities of the province for public safety3 through the use of modern 
technology, infrastructure and processes. In exercise of the powers 
conferred on it under section 19 of the 2016 Act, the Authority has framed 
PSCA Electronic Data Regulations 2016, which cover the whole process 
of collection, analysis, storage, presentation and use of electronic data. 
These are supplemented by the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for 
PPIC 3 Centre, Lahore. While the Authority has currently deployed

equipment only in a few major cities, there are plans for expansion to more 
cities in the future. This initiative has proven effective in crime control 
efforts. In areas where this infrastructure is available, Investigating 
Officers shall procure CCTV footage from the Authority following 
prescribed procedures and include it as part of the case record. If such 
footage is unavailable, the Investigating Officer shall obtain a certificate  
to this effect. 
26. 
 
Sectons 27 and 33(4) of the CNSA also aim to ensure the 
fairness and integrity of legal proceedings, safeguarding against false 
accusations and wrongful convictions. Section 27(1) stipulates that every 
person arrested and articles seized under a warrant issued under section  
20 shall be promptly forwarded to the authority by whom the warrant was 
issued. Furthermore, every person arrested and article seized under section 
20 or section 21 shall be promptly forwarded to (a) the officer-in-charge  
of the nearest police station and (b) the Special Court having jurisdiction. 
Section 27(2) states that the authority or officer to whom any person or 
article is forwarded as aforesaid shall, with all convenient dispatch, take 
such measures as may be necessary under the law for the disposal of such 
person or article. Section 33(4) provides that a narcotic drug, psychotropic 
substance, or controlled substance seized under the CNSA shall be 
disposed of under section 516 Cr.P.C. 
27. 
 
A combined reading of sections 27 and 33(4) of the CNSA 
reveals that the legislative scheme dictates that recovered narcotics should 
be produced before the Special Court at the time of remand. It has been 
observed that these provisions are often overlooked or disregarded in 
practice. All the Special Courts are directed to ensure strict compliance 
with them. 
28. 
 
The Registrar of this Court is directed to send copies of this 
order to the Special Courts in the province, the Chief Secretary, Punjab, 
and the Inspector General of Police, Punjab, for compliance.
