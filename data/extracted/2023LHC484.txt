MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J.:- This single judgment shall govern the 
subject appeal as well as connected appeals (ten in numbers) mentioned in 
the list appended hereinafter as Annexure “A”, all arising from orders of 
different dates passed by the Anti-Dumping Appellate Tribunal, 
Islamabad (hereinafter referred to as “Appellate Tribunal”) while 
exercising jurisdiction under Section 70 of the Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 
2015 (hereinafter referred to as “Act”).

F.A.O.No.74 of 2022. 
2. 
The appeals under consideration were initially placed before 
different Single Benches and were admitted for regular hearing 
accordingly. The respondents, however, resisted these appeals on the 
ground that since the impugned orders were passed by the “Appellate 
Tribunal”, so this Court lacks territorial jurisdiction. In this backdrop, 
vide order dated 02.11.2022, office was directed to place these appeals 
before the Hon’ble Chief Justice for constitution of Larger Bench as there 
was apparent disparity in various judgments to this effect. For ready 
reference and convenience, same is reproduced below:- 
“Ms. Nazma Parveen Malik, Advocate for the appellants. 
Mr. Arshad Mahmood Malik, Assistant Attorney-General for 
Pakistan. 
Mr. Waqas Amir, Advocate for respondent No.2. 
Ch. Muhammad Nawaz, Advocate for respondents No.3 & 4. 
This appeal as well as connected appeals are before 
this Court against the impugned final determination order 
dated 13.06.2018 passed by the learned Anti-Dumping 
Appellate Tribunal, Pakistan, exercising jurisdiction under 
the Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 2015. 
2. 
On behalf of the respondents, a question qua 
territorial jurisdiction of this Court has been raised and in 
support thereof learned counsel for the respondents has 
relied upon case laws  reported as Messrs KARACHI IRON 
AND 
STEEL 
MERCHANTS 
ASSOCIATION 
through 
Authorised Representative and 30 others vs. ANTI-
DUMPING APPELLATE TRIBUNAL and 22 others (2021 
PTD 1150), MUHAMMAD TAHIR MASOOD and 5 others 
vs. 
CHAIRMAN, 
STATE 
LIFE 
INSURANCE 
CORPORATION OF PAKISTAN and 2 others (2022 PLC 
(C.S) 439) and order passed in F.A.O.No.46 of 2020. 
3. 
Contrary to this, learned counsel for the appellants 
while convincing the Court that territorial jurisdiction vested 
in the Court places reliance on case law reported as 
“MUHAMMMAD 
FAYYAZ 
vs. 
FEDERATION 
OF 
PAKISTAN and others” (2022 PTD 399) and judgment dated 
14th October 2021, passed in W.P.No.62992 of 2021. 
4. 
Apparently there is a clear disparity amongst the 
judgments referred hereinabove. In order to remove this 
disparity, it would be apt to refer this matter to the Hon’ble 
Chief Justice for constitution of Large Bench. 
5. 
Office to proceed swiftly for the said purpose”. 

3 
F.A.O.No.74 of 2022. 
3. 
In furtherance of above, these appeals are now before us for 
resolution of the moot point relating to territorial jurisdiction of this Court 
against the decision of the “Appellate Tribunal”. We would, thus, refrain 
ourselves to delve into any other question canvassed in these appeals. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the appellants are 
importers of various commodities and they have been subjected to duty 
under the “Act”. He added that the “Appellate Tribunal” is since 
performing functions in connection with affairs of the Federation, so 
appeal can be adjudicated by any of the High Courts against its decision. 
Learned counsel contended that even otherwise the appellants are residing 
within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and it would be convenient 
for them as well to invoke the jurisdiction. It is further contended that it is 
negligence on the part of the Federation that it failed to establish Benches 
at Lahore, Karachi, Quetta and Peshawar and the appellants cannot be 
penalized on this score. Reliance is placed on TRADING CORPORATION 
OF PAKISTAN (PRIVATE) LIMITED vs. PAKISTAN AGRO FORESTRY 
CORPORATION (PRIVATE) LIMITED and another (2000 SCMR 1703) 
and MUHAMMAD FAYYAZ vs. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others 
(2022 PTD 399). 
5. 
Contrary to this, learned Law Officer as well as learned counsel 
representing the respondent-Department submitted that decision of the 
“Appellate Tribunal” can only be assailed before the learned Islamabad 
High Court. It is emphatically argued that not only order in original, but 
order in appeal were passed at Islamabad. Maintained that the appellants 
have now changed their addresses with mala-fide intent, so jurisdiction 
cannot be assumed on their convenience. Reliance is placed on 
SANDALBAR ENTERPRISES (PVT.) LTD. vs. CENTRAL BOARD OF 
REVENUE and others (PLD 1997 Supreme Court 334), Let.-Gen.(R) 
SALAHUDDIN TIRMIZI vs. ELECTION COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN (PLD 
2008 Supreme Court 735) and RASHID LATIF vs. FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN through Secretary Ministry of Inter Provincial Coordination 
and 2 others (PLD 2014 Sindh 135).

F.A.O.No.74 of 2022. 
6. 
Heard. Record perused. 
7. 
Before adverting to the moot question, it would be advantageous to 
observe that in order to give effect in Pakistan to the provisions of Article 
VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 1994, and to the 
Agreement on implementation thereof and to amend and consolidate the 
law relating to imposition of anti-dumping duties to offset such dumping, 
to provide a framework for investigation and determination of dumping 
and injury in respect of goods imported into Pakistan and for matters 
ancillary thereto or connected therewith, the “Act,” was promulgated. Part 
VII of the “Act” deals with initiation and conduct of investigations, 
whereunder the National Tariff Commission (hereinafter referred to as 
“Commission”) is empowered to conduct an investigation upon a written 
application by or on behalf of the domestic industry. Part IX of the “Act” 
deals with investigation procedures, preliminary and final determinations. 
Any person aggrieved or interested from the initiation of investigation or 
preliminary determination or even final determination can prefer an 
appeal before the “Appellate Tribunal” constituted by the Federal 
Government in terms of Section 64 of the “Act”. 
8. 
Section 70 deals with appellate procedures and it is the most pivotal 
provision for the resolution of the question raised before us. The decision 
of the “Appellate Tribunal” is appealable under sub-section (13) of 
Section 70 of the “Act”, which reads as under:- 
“70.---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
(1) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
(2) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
(3) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
(4) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------

5 
F.A.O.No.74 of 2022. 
(11) -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
(12) -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
(13) The decision of the Appellate Tribunal shall be 
appealable in the High Court. The High Court shall 
render a decision within ninety days of receiving an 
appeal from the decision of the Appellate Tribunal: 
Provided that the High Court shall not make an 
interim order against the conduct of investigation by the 
Commission unless the Commission has been given 
notice of the application and has had an opportunity of 
being heard and the High Court for reasons to be 
recorded in writing, is satisfied that the interim order 
would not have the effect of prejudicing or interfering 
with the carrying out of a public work or of otherwise 
being harmful to the public interest [or State property] 
or of impeding the assessment or collection of public 
revenues: 
Provided further that The Appellate Tribunal may, 
if it thinks fit accept an application from any party to an 
appeal in which the Appellate Tribunal has rendered its 
decision, for a clarification of any of the issues raised by 
the Appellate Tribunal in its decision: 
Provided also that such application shall specify 
the precise issue in respect of which a clarification is 
sought and given reasons as to why a clarification is 
necessary”. 
(underlining supplied for emphasis) 
; 
; 
; 
It is, thus, evident from the above that an appeal against the decision of 
the “Appellate Tribunal“ lies before the High Court. 
9. 
The term “High Court” is nowhere defined in the “Act”. This 
prompted the parties to raise the moot point.  Part VII of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 deals with the judicature and 
Chapter 1 defines the Courts. In terms of Article 175(1), there shall be a 
Supreme Court of Pakistan, a High Court for each Province and a High 
Court for Islamabad Capital Territory and such other courts as may be 
established by law. Chapter 3 deals with the High Courts and Article 192 

6 
F.A.O.No.74 of 2022. 
provides the composition and jurisdiction of a High Court. For ready 
reference and convenience, same is reproduced below:- 
“(1) A High Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and so many 
other Judges as may be determined by law or, until so 
determined, as may be fixed by the President. 
[(2) The Sind and Baluchistan High Court shall cease to 
function as a common High Court for the Provinces of 
Baluchistan and Sind. 
(3) 
The President shall, by Order, establish a High Court for 
each of the Provinces of Baluchistan and Sind and may 
make such provision in the Order for the principal seats of 
the two High Courts, transfer of the Judges of the common 
High Court, transfer of cases pending in the common High 
Court immediately before the establishment of two High 
Courts and, generally, for matters consequential or 
ancillary to the common High Court ceasing to function 
and the establishment of the two High Courts as he may 
deem fit. 
(4) 
The jurisdiction of a High Court may, by Act of 2[Majlis-e-
Shoora (Parliament)], be extended to any area in Pakistan 
not forming part of a Province”. 
10. 
It would not be out of context to mention here that initially, 
Islamabad High Court was not in existence and it was ultimately 
established through Act No.XVII of 2010, dated 2nd August, 2010. By 
virtue of Section 4 of the said Act, jurisdiction of Islamabad High Court 
was extended in respect of the Islamabad Capital Territory, original, 
appellate, revisional and other jurisdiction, as under the constitution or the 
laws in force immediately before the commencement of the Act ibid, 
which was previously exercisable in respect of the said territory by the 
Lahore High Court. 
11. 
Article 198 deals with seat of the High Court and reads as under:- 
[(l)] Each High Court in existence immediately before the 
commencing day shall continue to have its principal seat 
at the place where it had such seat before that day. 
2[(1A)The High Court for Islamabad Capital Territory shall 
have its principal seat at Islamabad.] 

7 
F.A.O.No.74 of 2022. 
[(2) Each High Court and the Judges and divisional courts 
thereof shall sit at its principal seat and the seats of its 
Benches and may hold, at any place within its territorial 
jurisdiction, circuit courts consisting of such of the Judges 
as may be nominated by the Chief Justice. 
(3) 
The Lahore High Court shall have a Bench each at 
Bahawalpur, Multan and Rawalpindi; the High Court of 
Sindh shall have a Bench at Sukkur; the Peshawar High 
Court shall have a Bench each at Abbottabad [, Mingora] 
and Dera Ismail Khan and the High Court of Baluchistan 
shall have a Bench at Sibi [and Turbat.] 
(4) 
Each of the High Courts may have Benches at such other 
places as the Governor may determine on the advice of the 
Cabinet and in consultation with the Chief Justice of the 
High Court. 
(5) 
A Bench referred in clause (3), or established under clause 
(4), shall consist of such of the Judges of the High Court as 
may be nominated by the Chief Justice from time to time 
for a period of not less than one year. 
(6) 
The Governor in consultation with the Chief Justice of the 
High Court shall make rules to provide the following 
matters, that is to say,— 
(a) 
assigning the area in relation to which each Bench 
shall exercise jurisdiction vested in the High Court; 
and 
(b) 
for all incidental, supplemental or consequential 
matters.] 
12. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that the “Appellate Tribunal” is 
performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation and 
it is amenable to writ jurisdiction, but we have to examine as to whether 
in the circumstances, this Court can exercise the jurisdiction constitutional 
or appellate against the decision of the “Appellate Tribunal”. It is an 
admitted fact that initially investigation was started by the “Commission” 
at Islamabad, which resulted into passing of order in original. The said 
order was assailed through an appeal before the “Appellate Tribunal” 
under Section 70(1)(2) of the “Act”, who decided the same through 
impugned order. 

8 
F.A.O.No.74 of 2022. 
13. 
We have noticed that the cause of action also arose either at 
Islamabad or Karachi and even the appellants before us while preferring 
their appeals before the “Appellate Tribunal” mentioned their addresses of 
places other than Rawalpindi. Apparently, the appellants have now 
changed addresses for their convenience or for any other reason best 
known to them. 
14. 
It is trite law that the Court cannot assume jurisdiction on the 
whims of the parties or to facilitate any of them. We cannot ignore the 
doctrine of forum non conveniens. It is founded on the principle that if 
some other forum is more appropriate and the interest of justice would be 
served better, the Court may decline to exercise jurisdiction on the ground 
that a case could be suitably tried by another Court. The above doctrine 
has come under discussion before this Court in HASSAN SHAHJEHAN vs. 
FPSC through Chairman and others (PLD 2017 Lahore 665) and while 
outlining the scope and object of the same, it was held as under:- 
“19. Another dimension of the case is the principle of forum 
non conveniens which is a discretionary power that allows 
courts to dismiss a case where another court, or forum, is much 
better suited to hear the case. This dismissal does not prevent a 
plaintiff from refiling his or her case in the more appropriate 
forum: The doctrine allows a court with jurisdiction over a case 
to dismiss it because the convenience of the parties and the 
interest of justice would be better served if the case were 
brought in a court having proper jurisdiction in another venue. 
"The doctrine of forum non conveniens, i.e., that some other 
forum is more "appropriate" in the sense of more suitable for 
the ends of justice, was developed by the Scottish courts in the 
nineteenth century, and was adopted (with some modifications) 
in the United States. The Scots rule is that the court may decline 
to exercise jurisdiction, after giving consideration to the 
interests of the parties and the requirements of justice, on the 
ground that the case cannot be suitably tried in the Scottish 
court nor full justice be done there, but only in another court. 
The basic principle is that.... the court is satisfied that there is 
some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, 
which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e. in 
which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of 
all the parties and the ends of justice. Applying this principle to 
the facts of the present case, the matter in hand, can best be 
resolved at the Supreme Court of Pakistan. 

9 
F.A.O.No.74 of 2022. 
Guidance to the above effect can also be sought from SANDALBAR 
ENTERPRISES (PVT.) LTD. vs. CENTRAL BOARD OF REVENUE and 
others (PLD 1997 Supreme Court 334) and Let.-Gen.(R) SALAHUDDIN 
TIRMIZI vs. ELECTION COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN (PLD 2008 
Supreme Court 735). 
15. 
In somewhat similar circumstances, in the case of Messrs 
KARACHI IRON AND STEEL MERCANTS ASSOCIATION through 
Authorised Representative and 30 others vs. ANTI-DUMPING 
APPELLATE TRIBUNAL and 22 others (2021 PTD 1150), the learned 
Sindh High Court observed as under:- 
“6. 
It is an undeniable position that the appellant(s) did contest 
the matter before the Tribunal, constituted at Islamabad over 
which this Court has got no administrative control therefore, mere 
plea of 'convenience' is never sufficient for choosing the Court(s) 
rather it is always the commandment of the law and law alone 
which describes the 'jurisdiction'. Failure of the Federation in 
establishing Tribunal(s) at other provinces is also no ground to 
press right of convenience. Further, the matter appears to be 
between the parties alone hence the same, legally, can't be taken 
as having applicability thereof on people at large. It is conducive 
to refer the case of Rashid Latif v. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary Ministry of Inter Provincial Coordination (PLD 2014 
Karachi 135 (authored by me in a DB matter) wherein the issue of 
jurisdiction is discussed in detail while discussing all the 
citations. The conclusion was that in case an action of Federation, 
if affecting community or public at large then same may be 
challenged before High Court of other province, too but if the 
same is personam relating to any party then the jurisdiction would 
lie with the High Court of the area where order is passed. 
7. 
Here the situation is different as the Tribunal is constituted 
at Islamabad. Admittedly the appeals preferred by the appellants 
at Islamabad Tribunal and all parties contested their case at 
Rawalpindi Bench in FAO, against the said order four appeals 
are filed at Islamabad High Court, hence I agree with the same 
referred observation and hold the present appeal(s) to be 
incompetent. Accordingly, captioned appeals are dismissed on the 
point of jurisdiction”. 
16. 
So far judgment in the case of TRADING CORPORATION OF 
PAKISTAN (supra) heavily relied upon by the learned counsel for the 
appellants is concerned, it is observed that in the said case, facts were 

10 
F.A.O.No.74 of 2022. 
entirely different. Moreover, said judgment was rendered by the Hon’ble 
Apex Court with reference to Article 199 of the “Constitution”. 
17. 
Though learned counsel has also relied upon MUHAMMMAD 
FAYYAZ vs. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others (2022 PTD 399), but 
we have no hesitation to observe that a question of territorial jurisdiction 
was though raised before the learned Single Judge, but it was not at all 
consciously attended or responded by the Court. 
18. 
The crux of above discussion is that word “High Court” used 
in sub-section (13) of Section 70 of the “Act” corresponds to 
Islamabad High Court and, as such, this Court lacks territorial 
jurisdiction to ponder upon the decision of the “Appellate Tribunal”. 
19. 
Resultantly, all these appeals are hereby returned to the 
appellants to present the same to the Court of competent jurisdiction. 
20. 
Disposed of on above terms.
