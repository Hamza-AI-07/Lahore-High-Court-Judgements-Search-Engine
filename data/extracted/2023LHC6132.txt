The petitioner namely Ghulam Qadir Khan is 
amongst the accused in Accountability Reference No.6 of 2014 
facing trial before the learned District & Sessions Judge/ Judge 
Accountability Court No.III, Rawalpindi. Through instant 
petition, he is seeking his release on post-arrest bail. 
2.   
The precise allegations against the petitioner are 
that he fraudulently/dishonestly signed Musharkat agreements 
with the intention to defraud the public at large while stating 
that he is running different businesses in Pakistan as well as 
abroad alongwith his co-accused. It is alleged against the 
petitioner that during investigation he admitted that actually 
there was no business on ground. As per opinion of the 
Investigating Officer, the petitioner in connivance with the 
other accused persons deprived the general public of their 
hard-earned money. 
3.    
We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner 
and the learned Prosecutor for National Accountability Bureau 
and perused the record.

4.     
The prosecution in this case was set into motion on 
receiving of several complaints by launching an inquiry against 
Asif Javed (alias Molvi Ibrahim), Director M/s Elixir Group 
and others on 6th January, 2014, which was later on upgraded 
into investigation on 18th April, 2014. On completion of 
investigation, reference No.6 of 2014 was filed against 12 
accused persons whereas 09 were declared as proclaimed 
offenders and trial was conducted against three persons namely 
Asif Javed alias Maulvi Ibrahim, Shahid Aziz and Yasir Aziz. 
The said accused were then convicted by the Accountability 
Court No.III, Rawalpindi through judgment dated 30th June, 
2016. The petitioner was arrested on 8th November, 2021 and 
he remained on physical remand till 8th December, 2021. 
5.     
As per prosecution’s own case, initially petitioner 
was not implicated in the alleged offence, however, after his 
arrest 116 claimants came forward and got recorded their 
statements disclosing some incriminating material against the 
petitioner. The petitioner was sent to face the trial before the 
Accountability Court. He was charged under sections 9 (a)(iii), 
(iv), (ix) and (xii) read with section 10 of the National 
Accountability Ordinance, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as 
“Ordinance”) on 24th November, 2022. 
6.   
We have noticed that initially the petitioner sought 
his release through W.P.No.725 of 2023, which was disposed of 
with the following observations: - 
 
“Learned counsel for the petitioner does not press 
this petition provided a direction may be issued to the 
learned trial court to conclude the trial expeditiously, 
which is disposed of as such. However, learned trial court 
is directed to conclude the trial within a period of 04-
weeks from the date of receipt of certified copy of this 
order even on day-to-day basis under intimation to 
Additional Registrar (Judl.) of this Court. Otherwise, the 
petitioner would be at liberty to move a fresh petition on 

3 
 
        W.P.No.2366 of 2023 
 
 
 
the same ground before this Court if delay in conclusion 
of trial is not attributed to him.”  
7.   
The petitioner is now seeking his release on bail 
firstly on the ground that despite lapse of considerable period, 
his trial has not been concluded and secondly there is no 
incriminating material against him. As already observed the 
petitioner was arrested on 8th November, 2021 and since his 
arrest he is behind the bars for last about two years. We have 
been apprised by the learned Prosecutor for NAB that so far 
120 witnesses have been recorded but he remained unable to 
give any definite time for the conclusion of the trial. Admittedly 
there are hundreds of claimants.  
8.   
Section 16 of the “Ordinance” as amended by Act 
No.XI of 2022 dated 22nd June, 2022 mandates that the trial of 
accused under the “Ordinance” shall be completed within one 
year. Previously in the first writ petition, trial Court was 
directed to conclude the trial within period of four weeks from 
the date of receipt of copy of order even on day to day basis. 
There is no cavil that failure to comply the order on the 
direction of Court would not vest a right upon the accused to 
claim bail but at the same time, expeditious trial is an 
inalienable right of every accused. Early trial, in the 
circumstances, is not in sight in near future. The petitioner 
cannot be left at the mercy of the prosecution to be rotten in jail 
for an indefinite period. It is an admitted fact that the petitioner 
has not attributed to the delay in conclusion of trial. Needless 
to observe that delay in prosecution of accused amounts to 
abuse the process of law. Guidance in this respect can be 
sought from CHAIRMAN, NAB through P.G., v. NASAR 
ULLAH and 5 others (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 497). The 
relevant extract from the same is reproduced below:- 
7. "Delay" in the conclusion of a criminal trial is antithetic 
to the very concept of a "fair trial" and "due process" 
guaranteed by Article 10A of the Constitution. The right to a 

4 
 
        W.P.No.2366 of 2023 
 
 
 
fair trial is a cardinal requirement of the rule of law. If an 
accused cannot be tried fairly for an offence, he should not 
be tried for it at all. Conclusion of trial within a reasonable 
time is an essential component of the right to a fair trial. The 
prolonged pre-trial detention of the accused also defies the 
presumption of innocence, another essential element of the 
right to a fair trial, for an accused is presumed innocent until 
he is proven guilty by proof beyond reasonable doubt. Even 
before the addition of Article 10A in the Constitution, the 
right to a fair trial and due process was well-entrenched in 
our jurisprudence and considered to be a part of the right of 
access to justice enshrined in the constitutional right to be 
dealt with in accordance with law guaranteed by Article 4 
and the fundamental right to life and liberty guaranteed by 
Article 9 of the Constitution. The incorporation of the right 
to a fair trial and due process by Article 10-A in the 
Constitution 
as 
an 
independent 
fundamental 
right 
underscores the constitutional significance of fair trial and 
due process and like other fundamental rights, it is to receive 
a liberal and progressive interpretation and enforcement. 
8. The NAB Ordinance though does not provide for the 
release of an accused on bail pending his trial but ensures 
the expeditious conclusion of the trial, and thereby 
eliminates the possibility of protracted detention of the 
accused before his conviction. Under Section 16(a) of the 
NAB Ordinance, the trial is to proceed on a day-to-day basis 
and to be concluded within thirty days. The bar on granting 
bail to the accused under the NAB Ordinance is equitably 
balanced by providing for the trial to proceed on a day-to-
day basis and its conclusion within thirty days. This 
statutory balance between the bar to grant bail and the 
expeditious conclusion of the trial would be rendered 
meaningless if an under-trial accused is detained for a long 
unexplained and unjustified period without determination of 
his guilt. While Section 16(a) of the NAB Ordinance that 
provides for concluding the trial within a period of thirty 
days is not to be construed strictly and applied rigidly as 
held in Tallat Ishaq, it manifests clearly the legislative intent 
for expeditious conclusion of the trial. The Legislature 
cannot be presumed to have intended an inordinate delay in 
conclusion of the trial and a prolonged detention of an 
under-trial accused, as a reasonable intention must always be 
attributed to the Legislature. Therefore, when the provision 
of NAB Ordinance requiring conclusion of trial within thirty 
days is not implemented, the corresponding provision 
barring grant of bail to the accused would also become 
proportionally plaint. If the scheme of a law in regard to a 
vital part fails, the sanctity of the other part, as observed by 
Salahuddin, J. in Zahur Ilahi, must of necessity be affected 
and what appears to be rigid must give way to flexibility. 
Inordinate delay in conclusion of the trial of an accused, for 
no fault on his part, being not envisaged by the NAB 
Ordinance would inevitably attract the constitutional 
protections under Articles 4, 9 and 10A of the Constitution. 
In such a situation, it is just, fair and equitable that the 

5 
 
        W.P.No.2366 of 2023 
 
 
 
prosecution (NAB) should not oppose bail, and if it does so, 
the courts would consider the opposition as unreasonable 
and grant bail, enforcing the fundamental rights of the 
accused. 
9. Inordinate or long delay in the conclusion of the trial for 
no fault of the accused and his protracted detention without 
determination of his guilt, as held by this Court in Riasat 
Ali, amount to harassment and abuse of the process of law. 
Such delay can therefore be a valid ground for releasing the 
accused on bail and restoring his fundamental right to life 
and liberty. No doubt, the right to life and liberty guaranteed 
by Article 9 of the Constitution is "subject to law" but the 
law, which can curtail this right, means a law that promotes 
larger public interest and not a law that impedes "fair trial" 
and limits "due process". The general criminal law has 
balanced the public interest and individual rights to life and 
liberty by recognizing the right of an accused to be released 
on bail, in case the trial against him is not concluded, for no 
fault on his part, within a specified period from the date of 
his detention, that is, one year for offences not punishable 
with death and two years for offences punishable with death. 
Tallat Ishaq relied upon by the learned counsel for the 
petitioner also recognizes the ground of "shocking, 
unconscionable and inordinate delay" in the conclusion of 
the trial as a ground for granting the accused the relief of 
bail. Tallat Ishaq, however, does not specify what period of 
delay would be considered as "shocking, unconscionable and 
inordinate". It has left to the discretion of the courts to 
determine it in the peculiar facts and circumstances of each 
case. Such a discretion must be structured equitably and 
exercised uniformly. In this regard, the courts can borrow 
guidance from, and act upon, the legislative wisdom codified 
in the general criminal law balancing the public interest with 
the individual rights, and can accordingly give effect to the 
scheme of the NAB Ordinance and enforce the fundamental 
rights of the accused to life, liberty, fair trial and due process 
guaranteed under Articles 9 and 10A of the Constitution. 
 Reference to this effect can also be made to MUHAMMAD 
NADEEM 
ANWAR 
and 
another 
v 
NATIONAL 
ACCOUNTABILITY BUREAU and others (PLD 2008 SC 645), 
ANWARUL HAQ QURESHI v. NATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY 
BUREAU and another (2008 SCMR 1135), MUHAMMAD 
JAMEEL RAHI v. D.G. NAB and others (2012 SCMR 552) and 
HIMESH KHAN v. The NATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY 
BUREAU (NAB), LAHORE and others (2015 SCMR 1092).  
9.   
After having an overview of the principles laid down 
hereinabove, we are of the considered opinion that it is an 

6 
 
        W.P.No.2366 of 2023 
 
 
 
inalienable right of every accused to have expeditious and fair 
trial, which right is even guaranteed under Article 10-A of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
10.  
Adverting to the merits of the case, we have noticed 
that so far 122 witnesses have been examined by the 
prosecution out of which most of them and more specifically 
PW-36 Muhammad Tahir Saleem, PW-37 Khan Bahadar and 
PW-38 Gohar Arman etc. did not implicate the petitioner 
directly in the alleged offence. Mere allegation of a heinous 
offence is no ground to keep the petitioner behind the gallows. 
11.  
It is well settled principle that the Superior Courts 
have the power to grant bail under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
independent of any statutory source of jurisdiction such as 497 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter referred 
to as “Cr.P.C”). We are well aware that initially by virtue of 
section 9(b) of the “Ordinance”, the jurisdiction under sections 
426, 491, 497, 498 & 561-A “Cr.P.C” of all the Courts 
including the High Court to grant bail to any person accused of 
an offence under the “Ordinance” was curtailed but while 
examining the vires of the “Ordinance” in KHAN ASFANDYAR 
WALI and others v. FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through 
Cabinet Division, Islamabad and others (PLD 2001 Supreme 
Court 607) the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:- 
 
 
197. 
It was held in the case of Zafar Ali Shah (supra) that 
the powers of the superior Courts under Article 199 of the 
Constitution “remain available to their full extent…. 
Notwithstanding anything contained in any legislative 
instrument enacted by the Chief Executive.” Whereas, section 
9(b) of the NAB Ordinance purports to deny to all Courts, 
including the High Courts, the jurisdiction under sections 426, 
491, 497, 498 and 561A or any other provision of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure or any other law for the time being in 
force, to grant bail to any person accused of an offence under 
the NAB Ordinance. It is well settled that the Superior Courts 
have the power to grant bail under Article 199 of the 

7 
 
        W.P.No.2366 of 2023 
 
 
 
Constitution, independent or any statutory source of 
jurisdiction such as section 497 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code, section 9(b) of the NAB Ordinance to that extent is ultra 
vires the Constitution. Accordingly, the same be amended 
suitably. 
12.  
There is no cavil to the proposition that at bail stage, 
only tentative assessment of the material available is to be 
made for forming an opinion as to whether reasonable grounds 
exist against the accused for the commission of alleged offence. 
After having cursory glance of the available material, we are of 
the considered opinion that in view of circumstances narrated 
herein above, the involvement of the petitioner in the alleged 
offence is not free from doubt and his case clearly falls within 
the ambit of further inquiry as per contemplation of Section 497 
(2) of “Cr.P.C”. The petitioner has, thus, successfully made out 
his case for his release pending trial. 
13.  
Resultantly, we are inclined to allow this petition 
and enlarge the petitioner namely Ghulam Qadir Khan on bail 
subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.10,00,000/-
(rupees ten lac) with two sureties each in the like amount to the 
satisfaction of the trial Court. 
14.   
Needless to observe that the observations made 
hereinabove are only tentative in their nature and are strictly 
confined to the extent of grant of instant bail.
