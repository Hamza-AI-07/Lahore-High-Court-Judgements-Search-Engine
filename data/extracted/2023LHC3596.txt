Acquisition Collector / Assistant Commissioner, Bahawalpur. 
Respondents herein are also appellants in cross-appeals, which 
are seeking enhancement in the quantum of price and value of 
the property acquired.    
3. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondents are legal heirs/ 
descendants of late Sir Sadiq Muhammad Khan Abbasi, the 
Ameer of Bahawalpur and inherited moveable & immovable 
property (urban & rural) in proportion of their shares in 
accordance with law of Sharia, declared and affirmed by 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan. The Land Acquisition 
Collector, Bahawalpur issued Notification under section 4 of 
the Act of 1894 dated 12.05.1997 to acquire land measuring 95 
Acres, 2 Kanals & 2 Marlas situated in Mouza Dera Izzat, 
Tehsil & District, Bahawalpur known as Noor Mahal.

Rs.5,835/- per Marla, cost of building as Rs.1,33,58,000/-, cost 
of fruit trees as Rs.7,82,470/-, cost of non-fruity trees

After recording evidence and hearing arguments from all 
sides, learned Referee Court, vide judgment dated 14.12.2010, 
held respondents entitled to compensation of their enhanced 
share of acquired land @ Rs.3000/- per Marla in addition to that 
the respondents were entitled to get compensation as per their 
legal share from the acquired costs of building which was 
enhanced to rupees one crore, they were also entitled to 
compulsory charge of acquisition @ 15% and compound 

4 
RFA No.47 of 2017/BWP & connected cases 
interest @ 08% per annum upon the enhanced amount. Feeling 
aggrieved, respondents approached this Court by filing various 
appeals, which were decided vide judgment dated 04.10.2016, 
whereby order of learned Referee Court was set aside and 
Reference Applications were remanded for decision afresh after 
hearing the parties and perusing the documents brought on 
record as well as oral evidence of the parties. In post remand 
proceedings, learned Referee Court partly accepted the 
Reference Applications in the terms narrated in preceding 
paragraph, vide judgment dated 25.02.2017. Hence, this and 
cross-appeals. 
4. 
Learned counsel for appellants submits that respondents 
remained fully engaged throughout the acquisition proceedings,  
represented -through their counsel, and objections submitted 
were thoroughly adjudicated upon by the Acquisition Collector 
after hearing them at length, thus, Reference Applications 
before Civil Court were not maintainable. He adds that 
respondents received the amount of compensation as per their 
share, calculated as per the criteria laid down in the Act of 
1894, and were fully satisfied with quantum of compensation 
proceedings as well as award. He contends that enhanced 
amount @ Rs.15,000/- per Marla, increase in costs of building, 
compulsory acquisition charges and compound interest are very 
high, which determination otherwise was not supported by valid 
lawful reasons. He argues that at the time of pronouncement of 
award, landowners were present and none of them objected to 
the amount of the compensation and received the same without 
protest, which even otherwise, was adequate in the context of 
the peculiar description of the property, Noor Mahal, with low 
saleable value. He further submits that the Referee Court has 
not rightly appreciated the material aspects of the matter and 

5 
RFA No.47 of 2017/BWP & connected cases 
evidence brought on record, hence impugned judgment and 
decree is unsustainable in the eye of law. 
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondents submits that 
learned Referee Court fully acknowledged in the impugned 
judgment that Noor Mahal palace has its monumental value and 
depicts real cultural aspects of the society, however awarded 
meagre and inconsequential increase in the amount of 
compensation of both the land and building. He further submits 
that palace is comprising of glorious building, acquired land is 
situated in Cantonment Area and if the property was put to 
auction at relevant time the same would fetch billions of rupees 
in as much as at present its value is 10 times higher. He argues 
that the acquired property is admittedly urban property 
surrounded by numerous housing schemes, names whereof are 
mentioned in the award, but its potential value has not been 
correctly determined by the Referee Court. He contends that in 
post-remand proceedings, respondents filed two applications: 
one for additional evidence and other for appointment of local 
commission to determine future potential value but these 
applications were arbitrarily dismissed by the Referee Court. 
He maintains that since remand order of this Court has attained 
finality, therefore appellants are precluded to agitate the matter 
again before this Court. He maintains that respondents received 
compensation under protest and challenged the award before 
Collector for referring the same to Referee Court for 
determination of correct compensation. In the end, he submits 
that respondents are entitled to enhanced compensation within 
the contemplation of Sections 23 & 24 of the Act of 1894. 
6. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
7. 
This is second round of litigation before this Court. In 
previous round, against judgment and decree dated 14.12.2010, 

6 
RFA No.47 of 2017/BWP & connected cases 
passed by learned Referee Court, a learned Division Bench of 
this Court vide judgment dated 04.10.2016, passed in RFA 
No.15 of 2011 and other connected cases, remanded the matters 
to learned Referee Court for decision afresh. Now, through 
judgment under challenge in these appeals, the Referee Court 
has enhanced -the value / price of acquired property, 
compensation for the acquired costs of building, compulsory 
charges of acquisition and compound interest, as detailed in 
paragraph 2 of this judgment. Appellants are not satisfied by the 
decision of learned Referee Court and are urging to restore the 
award announced by the Collector. The respondents are also not 
still pleased with the decision of learned Referee Court, 
whereby their entitlement under all heads has considerably been 
increased by the Referee Court, and claim further enhancement 
by this Court.   
8. 
There were three main issues in the matter, which for 
ready reference are reiterated and re-numbered as under:- 
A. 
What was the market value of suit property at the time of its 
acquisition by appellants? OPP 
B. 
Whether the assessment of the valuation made by Acquiring 
Collector is very low as compared to the market value which 
is not less than one lac per Marla? OPP 
C. 
Whether the factum enumerated under section 3 of the Land 
Acquisition Act was not applied by Acquiring Collector while 
making assessment of the value of Noor Mahal, if so, its 
effects? OPP 
 
 
These issues are inter-linked and inter-connected, hence 
accumulative discussion over them is being made. The core 
controversy is what was the value of the acquired property at 
the relevant time and whether assessment made by the Collector 
is accurate or determination made by the Referee Court is fair 
and just. If both are on lesser side, what would be the adequate 
valuation / compensation.

9. 
Respondents have produced documentary evidence 
relating to transactions of sale of certain lands in the same 
Mouza wherein the acquired property is located. Mutation 
(Exh.P-8) shows sale price of property in Mouza Dera Izzat as 
Rs.6000/- per Marla, mutation (Exh.P-28) as Rs.5750/- per 
Marla, mutation (Exh.P-15) as Rs.6086/- per Marla, mutation 
(Exh.P-25) as Rs.8335/- per Marla,  mutations (Ex.P-12, 
Exh.P16, Exh.P-17, Exh.P-21, Exh.P-29, Exh.P-31, Exh.P-53, 
Exh.P-58) as Rs.12,000/- per Marla, mutations (Exh.P-13, 
Exh.P-19, Exh.P-22, Exh.P-23, Exh.P-26, Exh.P-30,  Exh.P-35, 
Exh.P-45, Exh.P-54 & Exh.P-59) as Rs.20,000/- per Marla,  
mutation (Exh.P-20) as Rs.22666/- per Marla, mutation (Exh.P-
24) as Rs.20888/- per Marla, mutations (Exh.P-35, Exh.P-36, 
Exh.P-46, Exh.P-47 & Exh.P-60) as Rs.25000/- per Marla.  
 
 
It is evident from the record that the above mutations 
have been sanctioned after the date of issuance of notification 
under section 4 of the Act of 1894 and before announcement of 
award, except mutations (Exh.P-19, 20, 28, 29 & 31), which 
were passed before issuance of Notification under section 4, 
relating to the year 1997. All these mutations are depicting the 
sale price of different lands in the same vicinity from Rs.6,000/- 
to Rs.20,000/- per Marla and learned Referee Court after 
appreciating the above irrefutable documentary evidence 
assessed the value @ Rs.15,000/- per Marla, which appears in 
conformity with the potential value of the property acquired. 
 
10. 
The above mutations are public documents, admissibility 
whereof was not disputed by the other side. Some of these 
mutations were sanctioned before the date of issuance of 
Notification under section 4 of the Act 1894 and some were 
passed before the announcement of the award. During 
proceedings, a local commission was also appointed, who 
submitted report (Exh.A-63) and also got recorded his 

8 
RFA No.47 of 2017/BWP & connected cases 
statement as CW-1, whereby he had given details of the 
building / constructed portion, furniture available therein, inner 
beauty, amenities, fruity and non-fruity trees, potential use of 
the acquired property and its market value.  
 
11. 
Appellants mainly relied upon value of the land in 
preceding year, specifically the rates approved by the Board of 
Revenue and mainly relied on Exh.R.1, however said document 
is not much helpful to appellants because said document 
pertained to the period w.e.f. 01.07.1994 to 30.06.1995 whereas 
as per notification under section 4 dated 13.05.1997, the 
duration of preceding year was from 13.05.1996 to 12.05.1997. 
Appellants claimed to have taken notice of only the average 
sale price of land in the Mouza for the period w.e.f. 01.07.1994 
to 30.06.1995 without considering the relevant material in the 
context of the provisions of the Act of 1894, the Land 
Acquisition Rules, 1983 (“the Rules of 1983”), and the 
judgments of the superior Courts. 
12. 
Learned 
Referee 
Court 
has 
rightly 
taken 
into 
consideration the potential value of the land by noting that 
building of Noor Mahal was beautifully decorated and 
furnished, having costly carpets, expensive chandeliers and big 
hanging frames on the walls; that its wooden work, carving 
floors and precious stone work also contributed towards its 
value on higher side in contrast to the property sold through 
afore-noted mutations; that Noor Mahal had monumental value 
and depicts real cultural aspects of the society. Learned Referee 
Court considered the peculiar nature of the property, its cultural 
and historical background and the potential value while fixing 
value of the acquired land @ Rs.15,000/- per Marla and costs of 
building, compulsory charges and compound interest are also 
based on proper appreciation of evidence brought on record.  

9 
RFA No.47 of 2017/BWP & connected cases 
 
13. 
We now consider the plea of enhancement of value and 
price of the property acquired, claimed through the cross-
appeals. 
Determination 
of 
the 
quantum 
of 
monetary 
compensation against compulsory acquisition of the property is 
dependent upon multiple factors, which inter alia included the 
nature of the property, location, potential use in the context of 
zoning regulations, proximity to the area in vicinity, salability 
prospectus, market acceptability of the property in the context 
of demand and supply thereof, ready availability of the buyers 
and above all readiness to pay realizable price of the property 
having peculiar features.  It is not disputed that Noor Mahal has 
a heritage aspect and the building manifests people’s and city’s 
collective identity. In this case the acquisition was for a purpose 
and that is to preserve, protect and retain the originality of the 
asset having monumental significance. Property in question 
may have frequent visitors but few willing and serious buyers. 
There is no gainsaying that property has a peculiar status, 
certainly high in cultural and aesthetic sense but limited 
salability options. Respondents are unable to convince this 
court to disbelieve the compensation determined by the Referee 
Court by producing evidence indicating willing buyer(s) ready 
to pay a price higher, than the price settled with respect to 
peculiar nature of the property and committing to preserve the 
status, architecture and originality of the building.  
14. 
Under the law, determination of compensation for the 
land compulsorily acquired was the duty not only of the 
State/executive 
functionaries 
(particularly 
of 
the 
Land 
Acquisition Collector), but once the landowners were not 
compensated by them, the duty for such determination, under 
the Constitution and the law, was cast upon the judicial forums, 
including the learned Referee Court and the superior Courts. It 
is not a dispute merely between two private parties, rather a 

10 
RFA No.47 of 2017/BWP & connected cases 
matter of compulsory acquisition of property of citizens, and 
that is why judicial forums have also been provided under the 
law so that when the matter passes from the executive to the 
judicial forum, the judicial forum itself could see if the 
landowners have been rightly compensated. The rules relating 
to private civil disputes between private parties could not be 
applied to the disputes relating to the Fundamental Rights.  
When the concept of compensation comes into play, even 
burden of proof loses significance. Evidence brought on record 
by the parties is to be seen in its entirety, stressing less qua the 
obligation of the onus to proof, and applying the principle of 
preponderance of evidence. 
 
15. 
It is appropriate to highlight statutory guidelines provided 
for determination of compensation and factors need to be 
appreciated. Section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 is 
elaborating the conditions / parameters to be considered while 
determining compensation in land acquisition matters and 
section 24 whereof is indicating factors ought not to be 
considered while doing aforesaid exercise. For ease of 
reference, both these provisions are reproduced hereinbelow: - 
23. 
Matters to be considered in determining compensation.–
In determining the amount of compensation to be awarded for land 
acquired under this Act, the Court shall take into consideration- 
first, the market-value of the land at the date of the publication of the 
notification under section 4, sub-section (1). 
 
Explanation- For the purpose of determining the market-value, the 
Court shall take into account transfer of land similarly situated and in 
similar use. only The potential-value of the land to be acquired if put 
to a different use shall be taken into consideration if it is proved that 
land similarly situated and previously in similar use has, before the 
date of the notification under sub-section (1) of section 4, been 
transferred with a view to being put to the use relied upon as 
affecting the potential value of the land to be acquired: 
Provided that- 

11 
RFA No.47 of 2017/BWP & connected cases 
(i) 
if the market-value has been increased in consequence of 
the land being put to a use which is unlawful or contrary to 
public policy that use shall be disregarded and the market-
value shall be deemed to be the market-value of the land if it 
were put to ordinary use; and 
(ii) 
if the market-value of any building has been increased in 
consequence of the building being so overcrowded as to be 
dangerous to the health of the inmates, such overcrowding 
shall be disregarded and the market-value shall be deemed 
to be the market-value of the building if occupied by such 
number of persons only as can be accommodated in it 
without risk of danger to health from overcrowding.  
secondly, the damage sustained by the person interested, by reason 
of the taking of any standing crops or trees which may be on the 
land at the time of the Collector's taking possession thereof;  
thirdly, the damage (if any) sustained by the person interested, at 
the time of the Collector's taking possession of the land, by reason 
of severing such land from his other land;  
fourthly, the damage (if any) sustained by the person interested, at 
the time of the Collector's taking possession of the land, by reason 
of the acquisition injuriously affecting his other property, movable or 
immovable, in any other manner, or his earnings; 
fifthly, if, in consequence of the acquisition of the land by the 
Collector, the person interested is compelled to change his 
residence or place of business, the reasonable expenses (if any) 
incidental to such change; and 
sixthly, the damage (if any) bona fide resulting from diminution of the 
profits of the land between the time of the publication of the 
declaration under section 6 and the time of the Collector's taking 
possession of the land.  
(2) 
In addition to the market-value of the land as above 
provided, the Court shall award a sum of fifteen per centum on such 
market-value, in consideration of the compulsory nature of the 
acquisition, if the acquisition has been made for a public purpose 
and a sum of twenty-five per centum on such market-value if the 
acquisition has been made for a Company.” 
 
24. Matters to be neglected in determining compensation.- But 
the Court shall not take into consideration- 
first, the degree of urgency which has led to the acquisition;  
secondly, any disinclination of the person interested to part with the 
land acquired;  
thirdly, any damage sustained by him which, if caused by a private 
person, would not render such person liable to a suit;  

12 
RFA No.47 of 2017/BWP & connected cases 
fourthly, any damage which is likely to be caused to the land 
acquired, after the date of the publication of the declaration under 
section 6, by or in consequence of the use to which it will be put;  
fifthly, any increase to the value of the land acquired likely to accrue 
from the use to which it will be put when acquired; 
sixthly, any increase to the value of the other land of the person 
interested likely to accrue from the use to which the land acquired 
will be put; or 
seventhly, any outlay or improvements on, or disposal of, the land 
acquired, commenced, made or effected without the sanction of the 
Collector after the date of the publication of the notification under 
section 4, sub-section (1).” 
16. 
Rule 10(1) of the Rules of 1983 binds the Commissioner 
of the Division to ensure certain things while issuing 
Notification under Section 5 of the Act of 1894 and its clause 
(iii) provides as under:- 
“(iii) 
The Collector of the district has carefully and prudently 
calculated the estimated price of the land sought to be acquired 
keeping in view:-  
 
(a) the factors laid down in sections 23 and 24 of the Act;  
 
(b) the classification of the land to be acquired and its location; 
and  
 
(c) the average market price of similar kind of land similarly 
located, on the basis of the price prevalent during the period 
of twelve months preceding the date of publication of 
Notification under section 4.”  
17. 
Under section 23(1) of the Act, compensation is to be 
determined based on the market value of the land at the date 
of publication of the notification under section 4 of the Act. 
The Court assessing compensation is required to take into 
consideration not only the present purpose or the present use 
to which the land is applied but also any other more 
beneficial purpose to which it might reasonably be put by the 
owner. Assessment of price is a complex combination, which 
requires consideration of contemporaneous conditions, at 
relevant time, and visionary approach to be mindful of the 
potentiality 
of 
the 
property, 
subject 
matter 
of 
acquisition. Compensation, ordinarily, has always to be 

13 
RFA No.47 of 2017/BWP & connected cases 
determined by reference to the price which a willing vendor 
may 
reasonably 
expect 
to 
obtain 
from 
a 
willing 
purchaser. When the land possesses some unusual, special or 
unique features as to its location or potentialities, due 
weightage must be attached to all these elements. After 
considering all the circumstances, the Court must arrive at a 
fair estimation of price with reference to existing and 
conspicuous circumstances and available evidence. The 
approach to be adopted ought to be liberal in the sense that it 
should not be too meticulous or pedantic in dealing with the 
evidence. It is also true that an entry in the revenue record as 
to the nature of the land may not be conclusive, but certainly 
a circumstantial fact. Superior Courts have extended due 
consideration to the factor of potentiality.  
18. 
Potential value means the value of the land based on 
the probability that if developed, considering its location and 
proximity to residential, commercial or industrial areas with 
amenities 
such 
as 
roads, 
water, 
gas, 
electricity, 
communication network and suitability, it has the potential to 
be developed, which will increase its value. The value of land 
must include the potentiality of the land because this is the 
value, which the landowners would benefit from if they were 
able to maintain their ownership over the land. So far as the 
determination of potential value is concerned, there is no 
mathematical formula, which is applied uniformly in every 
case. Each case needs to consider in the context of proximate 
facts but potential value must be factored along the market 
value. The objective is to ensure that the landowner not only 
gets the actual value of the land at the time of its acquisition 
but certainly benefit assessed on future prospects of the land. 
Consequently, factors such as entries in the revenue record 
and land classification(s) simplicitor cannot form the basis of 

14 
RFA No.47 of 2017/BWP & connected cases 
determination of compensation but prospective value thereof. 
Although, the Land Revenue Collector is required to classify 
the land being acquired with its location, under Rule 10 of the 
Rules, it is not the sole basis for calculating the estimated 
price of the land under acquisition. It is held by Hon’ble 
Apex Court in the case of Land Acquisition Collector and 
others v. Mst. Iqbal Begum and others (PLD 2010 SC 719) 
that if a landowner is deprived of his property he must be 
adequately compensated; give gold for gold and not copper 
for the gold. This is the essence of significance of potential 
value. The Hon’ble Apex Court has also held that 
compensation cannot be based on past sales of similar land in 
the same vicinity because potentiality cannot be determined 
without examining future prospects. Hence, compensation is 
about the value of the land, being its market value plus its 
potential value, ensuring that landowner is duly compensated. 
This is fundamental to the process of award of compensation. 
Reference is made to Land Acquisition Collector and others 
v. Mst. Iqbal Begum and others (PLD 2010 Supreme Court 
719), Province of Punjab through Land Acquisition Collector 
and another v. Begum Aziza (2014 SCMR 75), Land 
Acquisition Collector, G.S.C., N.T.D.C., (WAPDA), Lahore and 
another v. Mst. Surraya Mehmood Jan (2015 SCMR 28), Air

Learned Referee Court has rightly appreciated the 
material / evidence brought on record, facts of the case, 
applicable law / rules and dictum laid down by Hon’ble 
superior Courts while passing the impugned decision. Learned 
counsel for the parties could not make out a case for 
interference by us in the impugned decision in exercise of 
appellate jurisdiction. 
20. 
In view of the above, instant as well as connected 
appeals, being devoid of merits, are dismissed. No order as to 
costs.
