        06.11.2024 Mehram Ali Bali, Advocate for the appellant.  
 
Mr. Haroon Rasheed, Deputy Prosecutor General for the 
State (on Court’s call).  
Through this appeal, Muhammad Hussain (petitioner) has 
impugned the vires of orders dated: 09.10.2024 as well as 
14.10.2024 passed by trial court.  
2. 
Brief however necessary facts for disposal of this appeal 
are that Muhammad Hussain (present appellant) is facing trial 
as accused in the case arising out of F.I.R. No.386/2023 dated: 
24.02.2023 registered under Section: 9(1) 3 (c) of the Control 
of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 at Police Station: Millat 
Town, Faisalabad before learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Faisalabad/trial court; appellant did not appear before the trial 
court on 09.10.2024, he was declared as proclaimed offender, 
his surety bond was forfeited and Station House Officer was 
directed to enter name of the accused in the register of 
proclaimed offenders; relevant portion of said order is hereby 
reproduced:-  
 
“Accused has absented himself from the court 
deliberately. It is pertinent to mention here that it is well in 
knowledge of the accused that his case is pending 
adjudication in the court and despite having knowledge he 
has not appeared in court which shows his irrelevant 
conduct towards court proceedings. Nor he himself nor on 
behalf of the accused has brought in knowledge to the court 
regarding reasons of his absence. His conduct does not 
entitle any leniency. It is primary duty of the accused to 
appear before the court on each and every date. Therefore, 
reliance is place on PLD 1978 S.C, today I dispense 
proclamation under section 87 Cr.P.C and declare him as 
proclaimed offender. His surety bound is forfeited and 
separate proceedings are prepared under section 514

Cr.P.C against surety. S.H.O concerned is directed to enter 
the name of accused in the register of proclamation 
offender.    
Thereafter present appellant filed application for recalling of 
said order dated 09.10.2024 and marking his attendance before 
trial court (copy of said application is available at pages No.20-
21 of instant appeal) which was dismissed vide order dated 
14.10.2024 passed by trial court (copy of said order is available 
at page No.23 of this appeal) and relevant portion of the same is 
hereby reproduced:-  
 
“Perusal of record reveals that accused was facing trial 
before this court in case F.I.R No.386 dated 24.02.2023 under 
section 9(i)3C CNSA 1997 registered at Police Station Millat 
Town, Faisalabad, who absented himself from the court resulting 
into carrying out the proceedings under section 87 Cr.P.C against 
him and he was declared proclaimed offender on 09.10.2024. 
Legality and propriety of such an order can be looked into by 
Hon’ble High Court being revisable under section 435 and 439 
Cr.P.C. In view of above, application stands dismissed.”  
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant and learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General (on Court’s call) submit in unison that 
impugned order dated 14.10.2024 is not in accordance with law 
and it would be appropriate to set-aside the same and refer 
matter back to the trial court for re-deciding said application 
through fresh order.   
4. 
After hearing learned counsel for the appellant, 
learned Deputy Prosecutor General and going through the 
available record appended with this appeal it has been 
noticed that vide order dated 09.10.2024 (mentioned above), 
appellant has been declared proclaimed offender and his surety 
bond has been forfeited. It is trite law that basic and prime 
purpose of issuance of process through notice, summons, 
bailable warrants, non-bailable warrants as well as proclamation 
is to bring the accused in the court for facing the proceedings of 
the case in accordance with law. When application for re-
calling of order dated 09.10.2024 was filed on behalf of

appellant and if he (appellant) himself appeared/surrendered 
before the court then it was appropriate for the court either to 
take him into custody as his surety bond was already forfeited 
vide order dated 09.10.2024 or to recall aforementioned order 
dated 09.10.2024 if reasons were cogent, relevant and plausible 
for recalling the same and undoubtedly order dated 09.10.2024 
is not the judgment rather an interim order; furthermore, it is 
also relevant to mention here that even warrant issued by the 
Court can be cancelled by the Court which issued it and Section 
75 Cr.P.C. is hereby reproduced for ready reference in this 
regard:  
 
“75. Form of warrant of arrest. (1) Every warrant 
of arrest issued by a Court under this Code shall be in 
writing, signed by the presiding officer, or in the case of a 
Bench of Magistrates, by any member of such Bench; and 
shall bear the seal of the Court.  
 
(2) Continuance of warrant of arrest. Every such 
warrant shall remain in force until it is cancelled by the 
Court which issued it, or until it is executed.” 
It goes without saying that application for recalling of order qua 
issuance of “warrant of arrest” or “proclamation” of accused is 
neither entertainable/maintainable nor proceedable without 
surrender of the accused in the Court. Therefore, with the 
concurrence of learned counsel for the appellant, learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General and for the safe administration of 
justice, afore-mentioned order dated 14.10.2024 passed by trial 
court is hereby set-aside, matter is remanded to the trial court 
where aforementioned application filed by the appellant for re-
calling of order dated 09.10.2024 will be deemed as pending 
and if appellant will surrender before trial court on 11.11.2024 
then said application would be decided through fresh order after 
hearing all concerned and strictly in accordance with law. 
However, if appellant will not surrender before trial court 
on 11.11.2024 then his application (mentioned above) 
would be not proceedable (as discussed above) and

law will take its own course in furtherance of order dated 
09.10.2024 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Faisalabad/trial court. With this observation, this appeal stands 
disposed of.
