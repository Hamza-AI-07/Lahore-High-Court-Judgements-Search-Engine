JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing 11.7.2024 
 
Petitioner by 
M/S Nadeemuddin Malik and H.M. 
Zeeshan Khan, Advocates. 
Respondents by 
 
M/S Malik Faisal Khalid, Malik Sahib 
Khan Awan and Qamar Zia Sandhu, 
Advocates. 
 
 
 
Abid Aziz Sheikh, J.-. This constitutional 
petition is directed against the final order dated 
20.12.2017 and judgment dated 12.12.2019 passed by 
learned Special Judge (Rent) and Appellate Court 
respectively, whereby the ejectment petition filed by 
respondent No.1 (respondent) against the petitioner 
(petitioner) was allowed.  
 
2. 
Relevant facts are that respondent being a 
Mutwalli of Ghulam Rasool Trust (Trust) filed 
ejectment petition on 30.1.2014 against the petitioner in 
respect of portion of the property (basement) measuring 
16 marla situated at 60-Shahrah-e-Quaid-E-Azam, 

W.P.No.1913/2020         
 2 
 
 
 
Ghulam Rasool Trust Building, Lahore (herein after 
referred to as rented premises). The petitioner filed 
leave to contest application under section 22(2) of the 
Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (Act), however, the 
same was treated beyond period of ten days by Courts 
below, nonetheless the ejectment petition was decided 
on merit and allowed by learned Special Judge (Rent) 
vide impugned final order dated 20.12.2017, which was 
also maintained by Appellate Court on 12.12.2019, 
hence this constitutional petition.  
 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that 
petitioner appeared before the Court for the first time on 
23.4.2014 and filed leave to contest application on 
03.5.2014. He submits that first day of appearance 
i.e.23.4.2014 was required to be excluded while 
calculating period of ten days under section 22(2) of the 
Act in view of section 8 of the Punjab General Clauses 
Act, 1956 (Act of 1956), hence leave to contest 
application was within a period of ten days. He further 
submits that ejectment petition was filed by one Zahid 
Moyeen being a Mutwalli (Mutwalli) of the Trust and 
not by the Trust itself, hence he had no authority or 
locus-standi to file ejectment petition. In this context, he 
further explained that in the earlier round of litigation, 
three similar ejectment petitions were filed in year 

W.P.No.1913/2020         
 3 
 
 
 
1989, 1999 and 2000 but all those ejectment petitions 
were either filed by the Trust through its Mutwalli or by 
Mutwalli alongwith the Trust, hence this ejectment 
petition only by Mutwalli without any authority to file 
the same is not maintainable. He next argued that 
admittedly, the original lease with the Trust was for 10 
years vide lease agreement dated 05.1.1962, however, 
on 27.3.1972, it was unanimously agreed that lease will 
be for 99 years and said mutual agreement was duly 
acknowledged by the then Mutwalli on 28.3.1972. He 
submits that though the respondent has denied the above 
assertion and claiming that lease was only for 10 years, 
however, this being a disputed question of fact could 
not be decided without grant of leave to contest and 
recording of evidence, hence impugned order and 
judgment is not sustainable.     
 
4. 
Learned counsel for the respondent on the other 
hand submits that leave to contest application being 
beyond period of ten days was barred by time. He 
further submits that scheme was formulated for the 
management, control and administration of waqf 
properties of Trust through award dated 18.6.1989 and 
under the said award, Mutwalli is not only empowered 
to give on rent or lease out any property of the waqf but 
he is also receiving the rent and operating the bank 

W.P.No.1913/2020         
 4 
 
 
 
accounts of the Trust on behalf of the Trust, therefore, 
he falls within the definition of landlord under section 
2(d) of the Act, hence can file the ejectment petition. On 
merit, he submits that the rented premises was handed 
over to the petitioner in year 1962 for period of 10 
years, which expired in year 1972 and thereafter, lease 
was renewed from year to year basis till 2013 but 
thereafter, the lease was not further extended. Submits 
that no document was executed between the parties for 
99 years perpetual lease. He submits that in the earlier 
ejectment petition filed in year 1989, the parties 
effected compromise on 29.5.1991 but it is nowhere 
specifically agreed in said compromise that lease is or 
was for period of 99 years. Further submits that in the 
subsequent ejectment petitions filed in year 1999 and 
2000, petitioner filed written replies but never claimed 
that lease is for 99 years, hence it is afterthought and 
cannot be a ground for leave to contest the ejectment 
petition. Submits that notwithstanding the above factual 
position, in any case, the so called 99 years lease being 
not a registered document, will be treated on month to 
month basis after lapse of 11 months and therefore, 
ejectment petition was maintainable.

6. 
Before touching merits of the case, I would like 
to decide the legal objection that whether the leave to 
contest application was within time or not. In this 
regard, it is admitted position on record that the 
ejectment petition by the respondent was filed on 
30.1.2014, in which, the petitioner made its first 
appearance in the Court on 23.4.2014 and thereafter, 
filed leave to contest application on 03.5.2024. The 
petitioner under section 22(2) of the Act was required to 
file leave to contest application within ten days of the 
first appearance. Admittedly, if the day of first 
appearance i.e. 23.4.2024 is included to compute the 
period of ten days, leave to contest application is time 
barred, however, if the said day is excluded, then the 
leave to contest application is within a period of ten 
days. Now the core legal question is that whether the 
first day of appearance is to be excluded or not for 
computing the ten days limitation under section 22(2) of 
the Act.  
 
7. 
The above legal question has already been 
examined by this Court in case titled Abdul Karim vs. 
Shakeel Ahmad etc (2012 CLC 261)and held that in 
view of section 8 of the Act of 1956, the first day of 
appearance will be excluded for computing the period 
of ten days. In the aforesaid case, the first appearance 

W.P.No.1913/2020         
 6 
 
 
 
before the Court was 05.9.2008 and the leave to contest 
application was filed on 15.9.2008. However, this Court 
held that in view of section 8 of the Act of 1956, the 
first day shall be excluded, hence leave to contest 
application was within ten days. The relevant part of the 
judgment is reproduced hereunder:- 
 
“The submission of learned counsel for the 
petitioner is equally not convincing in view of 
section 8 of West Pakistan General Clauses Act, 
1956 which provides the exclusion of the first day 
in calculating the period of limitation. This 
provision more particularly is applicable to the 
statutes to which the Limitation Act, 1908 is not 
applicable. If the time of 10-days prescribed for 
filing leave application is counted according to 
the provisions of section 8 then the application 
filed by the respondent on 15-9-2008 is well 
within time. The word “within” has been used in 
different 
other 
special 
statutes 
also; 
the 
interpretation for calculating time period shall be 
governed by provisions of General Clauses Act, 
1956. 
Keeping 
in 
view 
this 
beneficial 
interpretation of section 8 of Act (supra) this 
Court is of the view that the application filed by 
the respondent for contesting the ejectment 
petition was within the statutory period”.  
 
 
Similarly in case of Mst. Saima Zameer vs. Muhammad 
Javed Iqbal (2017 CLC 1695), recovery suit was filed 
under Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908 (CPC) and as per Appendix-B of Form-IV of 
CPC, the leave to appear and defend was to be filed 
within ten days of the service of the summons. In said 
case, the service was effected on 15.4.2011 whereas the 
application for leave to appear and defend was filed on 
25.4.2011, however, this Court held that in view of 

W.P.No.1913/2020         
 7 
 
 
 
section 8 of the Act of 1956 and section 9 of General 
Clauses Act, 1897 (Act of 1897), the day of service will 
be excluded from computing the period of ten days. 
Relevant extract from the judgment is reproduced 
hereunder:- 
“The service of summons in summary suit is 
effected through summons available in the 
Appendix 'B' of Form IV of the C.P.C. It is 
mentioned that "within 10 days from the service" 
the defendant has to obtain leave to appear and 
defend the suit. As the service was effected on 
15.04.2011, therefore, within 10 days means 
excluding 15.04.2011 and the last date for 
obtaining the leave to appear and defend was 
25.04.2011, therefore, the application for leave to 
appear and defend the suit has been filed within 
the prescribed period of limitation. To strengthen 
this legal position, it is necessary to reproduce  
the language of Section 9 of the General Clauses 
Act, 1897 as well as Section 8 of the West 
Pakistan General Clauses Act, 1956, respectively, 
as follows:- 
"9. Commencement and termination of 
time.--- (1) In any [Central Act] or 
Regulation made after the commencement 
of this Act, it shall be sufficient for the 
purpose of excluding the first in a series of 
days or any other period of time, to use the 
word "from", and, for the purpose of 
including the last in a series of days or any 
other period of time, to use the word "to". 
(2) This section applies also to all [Central 
Acts] made after the third day of January, 
1868, and to all Regulation made on or 
after the fourteenth day of January, 1887." 
"8. Commencement and termination of 
time.-- In any West Pakistan Act, it shall be 
sufficient, for the purpose of excluding the 
first in a series of days or any other period 
of time to use the word "from" and for the 
purpose of including the last in a series of 
days or any other period of time to use the 
word "to".  
It is clear that within 10 days from the service 
means that day of service be excluded from 

W.P.No.1913/2020         
 8 
 
 
 
computing the period of 10 days, therefore, the 
time provided for filing an application for leave 
to appear and defend the suit was till 25.04.2011 
when the day of service i.e. 15.04.2011 is 
excluded from computing the period of 10 days”. 
 
 
 
In the case of Babar Jahangir and another vs. 
Nadir Ali (2022 YLR 570), the same view was also 
expressed by Sindh High Court in respect of leave to 
contest application filed in suit under Order XXXVII 
CPC. The relevant text of the judgment is reproduced 
hereunder:- 
 
“The service of the summons in the summary suit 
is effected through summons available in the 
Appendix „B‟ of Form IV of the C.P.C. It is 
mentioned that “within 10 days from the service” 
the defendant has to obtain leave to appear and 
defend the suit. As the service was effected on 
16.3.2018, copy of the same is available on 
record, therefore, within ten days means 
excluding 16.3.2018 at lest the date of obtaining 
of leave to appear and defend was 26.3.2018, 
therefore, the application for leave to appear and 
defend the suit has been filed within the 
prescribed period of limitation”. 
  
 
The Supreme Court in case of Raja vs. Tanveer Riaz 
and others (PLD Supreme Court 466), while 
computing the period of 30 days for deposit of zar-e-
some under section 24 of the Preemption Act, 1991 
excluded the day on which order directing the pre-
emptor to make the deposit was passed, in view of 
section 8 of the Act of 1956.  
 
8. 
In view of above discussion and case law, there is 
no manner of doubt that application for leave to contest 

W.P.No.1913/2020         
 9 
 
 
 
filed by the petitioner was within statutory period of ten 
days prescribed under section 22(2) of the Act, hence 
was not barred by time.    
 
9. 
Notwithstanding the above legal position, it is 
noted that leave to contest application filed by the 
petitioner was not dismissed merely being time barred, 
rather same was discussed and decided on merits, hence 
there is no need to remand the case, rather this Court 
can adjudicate that whether the petitioner is entitled for 
leave to contest the ejectment petition on merits. In this 
regard, the perusal of leave to contest application shows 
that it is not disputed that petitioner is tenant of the 
Trust, however, the main contentions of the petitioner is 
that ejectment petition has not been filed by the Trust 
but by Mutwalli, who is not authorized to file ejectment 
petition and secondly vide correspondence dated 
27.3.1972 and 28.3.1972 with the then Mutwalli (Ch. 
Muhammad Afzal), the lease was extended for 99 years 
which will now expire in March, 2071, hence the 
ejectment petition is premature.  
 
10. 
I have carefully examined above contentions on 
merits. So far as the maintainability of ejectment 
petition by Mutwalli is concerned, admittedly, the waqf 
properties were dedicated by Ch. Ghulam Rasool under 
the 
waqf 
deed 
dated 
29.10.1917. 
However, 

W.P.No.1913/2020         
 10 
 
 
 
subsequently, the dispute and difference arisen between 
the parties with regard to the control, management and 
supervision of the waqf properties and consequently, the 
arbitration was carried out between respective parties 
and arbitration award (arbitration award) was passed 
on 18.6.1989. Under the aforesaid arbitration award, the 
Mutwalli inter-alia has the following powers:- 
 
Powers of Mutwalli. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
 
(b) 
The Mutwalli shall have the powers to 
engage Vakil, Advocate or a Mukhtar for the 
conduct of cases for and against the property 
made waqf. 
 
------------------------------- 
 
(d) 
That it would be in the competency of the 
Mutwalli of each unit to give on rent and lease 
out any property/properties for any period of time 
as he may deem fit and proper for the benefit of 
the waqf. 
 
 
From the above clauses of arbitration award, it is 
manifest that Mutwalli is not only empowered to engage 
counsel for the conduct of cases for the waqf property 
but he would also be competent to lease the property of 
the waqf. Beside above, the present Mutwalli (Zahid 
Moyeen) is not only receiving the rent from the 
petitioner on behalf of Trust (as evident from the 
petitioner letter dated 25.9.2008) but he is also 
authorized by the Trust to operate bank account of the 
Trust where the said rent is being deposited. Under 
section 15 of the Act, the “landlord” may seek eviction 

W.P.No.1913/2020         
 11 
 
 
 
of the tenant on various grounds mentioned therein. The 
term “landlord” is defined under section 2(d) of the Act 
which means owner of premises and includes a person 
entitled or authorized to receive rent in respect of the 
premises. In view of the above factual and legal positon,  
notwithstanding the fact that property is vested in the 
Trust, the Mutwalli being authorized to lease out the 
property and also receiving rent fall within the 
definition of landlord and could file ejectment petition.  
 
11. 
Regarding the next contention of the petitioner 
that lease was extended for period of 99 years vide 
petitioner’s offer dated 27.3.1972 acknowledged and 
responded by the then Mutwalli on 28.3.1972, suffice it 
to note that though respondent has vehemently denied 
the said assertion and claimed that lease was not further 
extended after 13.7.2013, however, even for the sake of 
argument if it is accepted that lease period was extended 
for period of 99 years, the said lease agreement being 
admittedly not a registered instrument as required under 
section 17(d) and 49 of the Registration Act, 1908 
(Registration Act) read with section 107 of the 
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (Transfer of Property 
Act), shall deem to be a lease from month to month 
basis terminable on part of lessor or lessee by 15 days 
notice.  

W.P.No.1913/2020         
 12 
 
 
 
 
12. 
The above legal position has been settled by 
Supreme Court in  Habib 
Bank 
Limited 
vs. 
Dr. 
Munawar Ali Siddiqui (1991 SCMR 1185) where it is 
held as under:- 
“ At this juncture, it may be pertinent to deal with 
the question, whether a lease in perpetuity can be 
created by a lease agreement, and if not, what 
rights the petitioner acquired under the lease 
agreement in issue. In this behalf, it may be 
pertinent to refer to section 107 of the Transfer of 
Property Act, 1882, and sections 17(d) and 49 of 
the Registration Act. Above section 107 of the 
former Act inter alia provides that a lease of 
immovable property from year to year or for any 
term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly 
rent can only be made by a registered instrument, 
whereas section 17(d) of the latter Act requires 
compulsory registration of a lease of the nature 
covered by section 107 of the former Act. Section 
49 of the latter Act provides for effect of 
non-registration of documents required to be 
registered as follows:-- 
  
"No document required to be registered under 
this Act or under any earlier law providing for or 
relating to registration of documents shall- 
  
(a) operate to create, declare, assign, limit or 
extinguish, whether in present or in future, any 
right, title or interest, whether vested or 
contingent, to or in immovable property, or 
  
(b) confer any power to adopt, unless it has been 
registered." 
  
 
It may he advantageous at this stage to refer to 
the case of Darbarilal Mudi and others :v. 
Raneegano Coal Association Ltd., reported in 
AIR 1944 Patna 30, in which a Division Bench of 
the Patna High Court held that a permanent 
lease, which has not been created by a registered 
instrument, is void under the provisions of 
section 107 and the tenancy is under section 106 
deemed to be a lease from month to month 
terminable either on the part of the lessor or the 
lessee by 15 days notice. We are, therefore, of the 

W.P.No.1913/2020         
 13 
 
 
 
view that the lease agreement, the copy of which 
has been filed with the above petition for leave, is 
not a legal document of the nature, on the basis 
of which the petitioner could have acquired lease 
in perpetuity”. 
 
 
In this context, reliance is also placed on Supreme Court 
judgments tilted Govt. of Sindh etc vs. Muhammad Shafi 
etc (PLD 2015 SC 380) and Mirza Book Agency etc vs. 
Additional District Judge etc (2013 SCMR 1520) and 
judgments of this Court in  Star Holdings vs. Dr. Nishat 
Afza 
Qureshi 
(2019 
CLC 
909), 
Messrs 
IRIS 
Communications (Pvt.) Ltd vs. Ahmad Khalid (2019 
MLD 772) and Israr Hussaain vs. Imtiaz Ahmad Sheikh 
etc (2024 CLC 486). 
 
13. 
It is also pertinent to note that though under 
section 5(3) of the Act, the Rent Registrar shall enter 
the particulars of the tenancy in a Register and also affix 
his official seal on the tenancy agreement, however, 
under section 5(4) of the Act, this entry will not absolve 
the landlord or tenant of the liability to register the 
tenancy agreement under the law relating to the 
registration of documents. Therefore, the law settled in 
aforesaid judgments and the effect of the non-
registration are applicable to all the rent deeds even 
after the promulgation of the Act.  
 
14. 
In view of above discussion, though Courts below 
have wrongly held that application for leave to contest 

W.P.No.1913/2020         
 14 
 
 
 
was not within the prescribed period of ten days, hence 
to that extent, impugned orders are not sustainable, 
however, on merits, no ground for leave to contest is 
made out hence ejectment petition was lawfully allowed 
against the petitioner.  
 
15. 
For what has been discussed above, this petition 
being meritless is dismissed.
