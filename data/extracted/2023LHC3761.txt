Petitioner by: 
Mr. Shakeel Ahmad Malik, Advocate 
State by: 
Mr. Shahid Nawab Cheema, AAG & 
Mr. Hafiz Asghar Ali DPG with

ALI ZIA BAJWA, J.:- Through this writ 
petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter „the Constitution‟), the 
petitioner has assailed the vires of the impugned order dated 
15.08.2022 passed by the ex-officio Justice of Peace (hereinafter 
„the JOP‟), Pakpattan Sharif, whereby the application under Section 
22-A(6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter „the 
Code‟) filed by her for registration of a criminal case was 
dismissed.  
2. 
Arguments heard and the record perused.  
3. 
The record reflects that the petitioner filed an application 
under Section 22-A (6) of the Code for registration of a criminal 
case before the JOP with the allegation that respondents No.5 to 9 
abducted her son namely Muhammad Usman on 03-11-2021 at 
gunpoint from the territorial jurisdiction of police station Chak Badi 

W.P. No.56691/2022

District, Pakpattan and took him away to an unknown place. The 
occurrence was witnessed by Munir Ahmad and Khadim. The 
petitioner further alleged that on 13.11.2021, she received the 
information that the dead body of her son was lying in DHQ 
Hospital, Sahiwal. On reaching the hospital, she was informed by 
the police of Police Station Ghalla Mandi, District Sahiwal that the 
dead body was hanging on a tree. JOP dismissed the application of 
the petitioner with findings as infra: -  
“that alleged occurrence qua abduction of son of petitioner has 
not taken place within District, Pakpattan Sharif and resultantly 
this Court is not inclined to order for registration of FIR. 
Hence, instant petition is hereby dismissed accordingly.”  
 
4. 
It has been straightaway observed by this Court that the 
JOP dismissed the application of the petitioner mainly on the 
grounds that no evidence could be brought on the record that son of 
the petitioner was abducted from District Pakpattan and since the 
dead body was found in District Sahiwal, therefore, direction for 
registration of criminal case cannot be issued. There are two 
important legal questions involved in this writ petition which are 
formulated as infra: -   
A) Whether JOP had any jurisdiction to render his finding 
qua the veracity of the allegations leveled against the 
proposed accused; and  
B) In a case where the abduction took place in District 
Pakpattan Sharif and the dead body was found in District 
Sahiwal, where the criminal case can be registered and 
investigated.   
5. 
 
As far as the first question is concerned, it is a 
settled proposition of law as enunciated by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan that the only jurisdiction which can be exercised by JOP 
under Section 22-A(6) of the Code is to examine whether the 
information disclosed by the applicant did or did not constitute a 

W.P. No.56691/2022 
 
3 
cognizable offence and if it did, then to direct the concerned Station 
House Officer to register an FIR, without going into the veracity of 
the information in question and no more.1 The JOP traveled beyond 
his mandate while holding in the impugned order, in an 
unequivocal manner, that the son of the petitioner was not abducted 
in the manner alleged by her. Such findings of the JOP are touching 
the merits and veracity of allegations, hence, utterly unwarranted 
and not sustainable in the eye of the law. These findings would 
have the effect of burying the case of the petitioner at its very 
inception, which is yet to be registered, investigated and tried. It has 
also been observed that the JOP while passing the impugned order 
used the word ‘Court’ for him, which is highly misconceived and 
misunderstood, as it is trite law that the office of JOP is a quasi-
judicial forum and functions performed by it cannot be termed 
judicial or of a court.2    
6. 
 
Now I would like to take up the next vital question, 
which in my humble view is not a complicated one, as the statutory 
provisions embodied in the Code and The Police Rules, 1934 
(hereinafter the „Rules) governing such situations are self-
explanatory and unambiguous. It shall be appropriate to reproduce 
the relevant Sections of the Code for better comprehension. 
Sections 156, 177 & 179 of the Code are of utmost importance and 
relevance, hence, have been reproduced hereinafter: -  
Section 156 of the Code 
Investigation into cognizable cases. (1) Any officer-incharge 
of a police-station may, without the order of a Magistrate, 
investigate any cognizable case which a Court having 
jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such 
station would have power to inquire into or try under the 
provisions of Chapter XV relating to the place of inquiry or 
trial.

2 PLD 2018 SC 595  

W.P. No.56691/2022

(4)……. 
 
Section 177 Cr.P.C. 
 Ordinary place of inquiry and trial -  Every offence shall 
ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a Court within the 
local limits of whose jurisdiction it was committed.  
 
 
Section 179 Cr.P.C. 
Accused triable in district where act is done or where 
consequence ensues. When a person is accused of the 
commission of offence by reason of anything which has been 
done, and of any consequence which has ensued, such 
offence may be inquired into or tried by a Court within the 
local limits of whose jurisdiction any such thing has been 
done, or any such consequence has ensued.   
 
Section 156 (1) of the Code contemplates that any officer-in-charge of 
a police station can investigate a cognizable offence, which a court 
having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such police 
station would have the power to inquire into or try under the 
provisions of Chapter XV of the Code relating to the place of inquiry 
or trial. A bare perusal of Sections 156 (1) and 177 of the Code makes 
it abundantly clear that as a general rule, a criminal case should be 
registered and investigated by the police station, within the local 
limits of whose jurisdiction such offence was committed. Keeping in 
perspective the word "ordinarily" in Section 177 read with Section 
156 (1) of the Code, it is apparent, that generally the occurrence is to 
be investigated at a place where it ordinarily occurs, so the word 
ordinarily means that it is a general principle. The exceptions to that 
general rule are contained in the Code itself in the contents of the 
succeeding Sections from 178 to 185 of the Code. For the purpose of 
lis in hand, the relevant provision of law is Section 179 of the Code.   
7. 
 
The cumulative effect of Sections 156 (1) and 179 of the 
Code is that an offence can be investigated by the police officer 
having territorial jurisdiction over the area where an act is committed 
or where the consequence of that act ensues. Sections 156 (1) and 

W.P. No.56691/2022 
 
5 
177 of the Code provide for the simplest cases and perhaps the cases 
which most frequently occur, namely, of an offence committed 
entirely within a single jurisdiction. On the other hand, Section 156 
(1) read with Section 179 of the Code enlarges as much as possible 
the ambit of the sites in which the criminal case can be registered and 
investigated to minimize, as much as possible, the inconvenience 
caused by a technical plea of want of territorial jurisdiction of a police 
station. The wisdom of lawmakers to extend the jurisdiction to 
various police stations, where an information qua the cognizable 
offence can be registered and investigated, is to provide against an 
accused escaping guilt. The general rule of lex fori3 has been relaxed 
by Section 156 (1) of the Code.   
8. 
 
Mere depiction of the occurrence, as stated in the 
applications filed before the police, reveals that the proposed accused 
abducted the son of the petitioner namely Usman at gunpoint which 
was seen by the eyewitnesses from the territorial jurisdiction of Police 
Station Chak Bedi, District PakPattan Sharif. Subsequently, his dead 
body was found hanging on a tree within the territorial jurisdiction of 
Police Station Ghalla Mandi, District Sahiwal. In view of the above-
discussed legal position, a criminal case qua the abduction and murder 
of the son of the petitioner namely Usman can be registered at any of 
the Districts, from where the deceased was abducted or from where 
his dead body was recovered. As the application was filed by the 
petitioner at Chak Bedi, District Pak Pattan Sharif, therefore, SHO of 
that police station was under a bounden duty to register the criminal 
case but unfortunately needful was not done. 
9. 
 
It would not be out of place to observe here that in a 
number of cognizable offences, registration of crime reports is 
delayed on the pretext of lack of territorial jurisdiction of a particular 
Police Station. Such conduct of police officers not only results in the 
                                       
3 According to Advanced Law Lexicon, Volume 3, published by LexisNexis, Lex fori means ‘The 
law of the forum of court.

loss of valuable evidence due to delay but also provides an 
opportunity for accused persons to escape their criminal liability. Law 
on the subject is very clear that if information regarding a cognizable 
offence is received, the same cannot be neglected on the pretext of 
lack of territorial jurisdiction.  Relevant rules of the Rules governing 
such situations have been reproduced for better understanding as 
infra: -  
25.3. Action when offence occurring in another police station is reported.-  
When the occurrence of a cognizable offence in another police station jurisdiction is 
reported, the fact shall be recorded in the daily diary and information shall be sent to 
the officer-in-charge of the police station in the jurisdiction of which the offence was 
committed. Meanwhile, all possible lawful measures shall be taken to secure the 
arrest of the offender and the detection of the offence.  
 
25.4. Where offence appears to have occurred in other police station.-  
(1) If a police officer after registering a case and commencing and investigation 
discovers that the offence was committed in the jurisdiction of another police station 
he shall at once send information to the officer-in-charge of such police station. 
(2) Upon receipt of information such officer shall proceed without delay to the place 
where the investigation is being held and undertake the investigation. 
 
25.5. Disputes as to jurisdiction.  
Should the officer who is thus summoned to the spot dispute the jurisdiction, both 
officers shall jointly carry on the investigation under the orders of the senior officer 
and neither shall leave until the question of jurisdiction has been settled and 
acknowledged. The case record shall be kept at the police station where the 
information was first received until the question of jurisdiction has been decided. 
 
25.8. Cases which may be lawfully investigated in more local areas than one. – 
 (1) If the case is one which the officer in charge of the police station may lawfully 
investigate, but which may also be lawfully and more successfully investigated in 
another police station, such officer while continuing his investigation, shall refer the 
matter to the Superintendent, who shall transfer the case or not as he sees fit. 
 (2) If it is desired to transfer the case to a police station in another district, the 
Superintendent shall refer the matter to the District Magistrate and move him to act 
according to the orders contained in Chapter 26, Volume III, of the Rules and Orders 
of the High Court. 

W.P. No.56691/2022

 (3) When an investigation has been transferred from one district to another the 
police files with original first information report shall be forwarded to the 
Superintendent of the district to which the transfer is made. 
 
The abovementioned rules are self-explanatory and clearly lay down 
an effective mechanism and the duties of a police officer in case of 
uncertainty regarding the territorial jurisdiction of a particular police 
station. The scheme of law provided under the rules clearly reflects 
the intention of the legislature that a blind eye cannot be turned to the 
information of the commission of a cognizable offence on the pretext 
of lack of territorial jurisdiction. For convenience following 
guidelines can be articulated: -  
I. 
When the information regarding the commission of the 
cognizable offence is furnished to the SHO of the Police 
Station, in whose territorial jurisdiction the offence has 
been committed, he is bound to register the criminal 
case immediately.4 
II. 
A criminal case can be registered and investigated in a 
police station where a cognizable offence is committed 
or where its consequences ensue.5 
III. 
In the case, where clearly a police station has no 
jurisdiction to investigate a cognizable offence and 
information of the same is received, such information 
shall be recorded in the daily diary and sent to the 
Officer Incharge of the relevant police station. 
Meanwhile, all possible lawful measures shall be taken 
to secure the arrest of the offender and the detection of 
the offence. 6 
IV. 
After registration of a criminal case and the start of the 
investigation by a police officer, if it transpires that the 
                                       
4 Section 154 of the Code & Rule 25.1 of The Police Rules, 1934.   
5 Section 156(1) read with Section 179 of the Code & Rule 25.8 of The Police Rules, 1934.   
6 Rule 25.3 of The Police Rules, 1934.  

W.P. No.56691/2022

police station lacks territorial jurisdiction, information 
shall be sent to the Officer Incharge of the relevant 
police station in that regard promptly, who shall take 
over the investigation without delay.7  
V. 
When a case is transferred from one police station to 
another due to lack of territorial jurisdiction or 
convenience of investigating officer having lawful 
authority to investigate that case8, the crime report 
registered in the original police station shall be canceled 
by the Superintendent of police concerned.9 The 
complete record of the case shall be sent to the police 
station where the case is transferred.10 
VI. 
When there is a dispute qua the territorial jurisdiction of 
two police stations, the criminal case shall be registered 
at the police station where the information of cognizable 
offence is received first. The investigation shall be 
carried out jointly by the police officers of both police 
stations until the question of jurisdiction has been settled 
and acknowledged.11 
10. 
 
In the sequel to above, I am of the considered view that 
the impugned order dated 15.08.2022 passed by the JOP is not 
sustainable in the eye of the law, therefore, while allowing this writ 
petition, the same is set aside with a direction to respondent No. 4 i.e. 
SHO Police Station Chak Bedi, District PakPattan Sharif to record the 
version of the petitioner under Section 154 of the Code and register a 
criminal case. It goes without saying that the investigation, in this 
case, should be conducted on merits after bringing on the record the 
evidence of both sides strictly in accordance with the law without
