Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – According to the prosecution, 
Saliha Munawar, Maida Iqbal, Faiza Zafar and Ayesha Nawaz studied at 
Government Sadiq College (Women University). They stayed at the 
Petitioner’s private hostel in Riaz Colony, Bahawalpur. The hostel had a 
water tank on the roof which was constantly leaking. The students 
repeatedly asked the Petitioner to get it repaired but he turned a deaf ear 
to them. In due course of time, water damaged the building, which was 
already in poor condition. On 29.04.2023, the roof caved in, killing Saliha 
Munawar and Maida Iqbal and injuring Faiza Zafar and Ayesha Nawaz. 
The Complainant, the father of one of the deceased girls, lodged FIR 
No.418/2023 dated 29.04.2023 under section 302 of the Pakistan Penal 
Code 1860 (“PPC”) at Police Station Civil Lines, District Bahawalpur, 
regarding the incident. During the investigation, the police substituted 
section 302 PPC with section 322 PPC. The Petitioner seeks pre-arrest bail 
in that case through this application. 
2. 
 
Mr Muhammad Sharif Bhatti, Advocate, contends that the 
Petitioner is not to blame for the occurrence. It was an Act of God. In any 
event, he is charged with an offence under section 322 PPC which does 
not carry a prison sentence. If the prosecution succeeds at the trial, he 
might only be liable for Diyat, which can be paid in instalments over five

years from the final judgement under Section 331 PPC. In the 
circumstances, the Petitioner may be granted pre-arrest bail. 
3. 
 
Rao Muhammad Riaz Ahmed Khan, Deputy Prosecutor 
General, has opposed this application. He contends that the offence 
under section 322 PPC is cognizable and non-bailable. The Petitioner 
cannot, therefore, claim pre-arrest bail as of right. 
4. 
 
The Complainant’s counsel, Mr Muhammad Jamil 
Chaudhry, Advocate, contends that the Petitioner is running a private 
hostel without the approval of the regulatory authorities. Two girls died, 
and two were injured because he failed to repair the water tank. He is 
fully responsible for the occurrence and is not eligible for the 
concession of pre-arrest bail, an extraordinary relief meant only for 
innocent people. 
5. 
 
I have heard the learned counsel and examined the record. 
FIR No.418/2023 was originally registered under section 302 PPC, but 
during the investigation, the police altered the offence to section 322 
PPC. The Petitioner is accused of Qatl-bis-sabab, which is defined in 
section 321 PPC as follows: 
 
321. Qatl-bis-sabab. Whoever, without any intention to cause death 
of, or cause harm to, any person, does any unlawful act which 
becomes a cause for the death of another person, is said to commit 
Qatl-bis-sabab. 
 
Illustration: 
A unlawfully digs a pit in the thoroughfare, but 
without any intention to cause the death of, or harm to, any person, 
B, while passing from there, falls in it and is killed. A has committed 
Qatl-bis-sabab. 
 
 
Section 322 PPC specifies punishment for Qatl-bis-sabab 
and states that the offence is punishable with Diyat. 
6. 
 
Analysis of section 321 PPC would show that this 
provision applies when a person (a) commits an unlawful act, (b) 
without any intention to cause the death of, or cause harm to any person, 
and (c) the said act becomes a cause for the death of another person. 
Clearly, mens rea is not the condition precedent to attract this section. 
The legislature has made actus reus culpable. The Pakistan Penal Code 
does not define “unlawful act”, so we must have recourse to the 
dictionary meaning. According to Black’s Law Dictionary, it connotes 

Crl. Misc. No.2349/B/2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
 
“conduct that is not authorized by law; a violation of a civil or criminal 
law”.1 
7. 
 
Generally, the common law punished those who caused a 
prohibited result by a positive act. Lord Macaulay’s Works summarize 
the position of the common law as follows: 
“In general … the penal law must content itself with keeping men 
from doing positive harm and must leave to public opinion, and the 
teachers of morality and religion, the offence of furnishing men with 
motives for doing positive good. It is evident that to attempt to 
punish men by law for not rendering to others all the service which 
it is their moral duty to render to others would be preposterous. We 
must grant impunity to the vast majority of those omissions which a 
benevolent morality would pronounce reprehensible and must 
content ourselves with punishing such omissions only when they are 
distinguished from the rest by some circumstances which mark them 
out as peculiarly fit objects of penal legislation.”2 
8. 
 
At common law, criminal liability for pure omissions is 
exceptional. In contemporary society, numerous statutes explicitly 
classify certain omissions as criminal offences, and in specific 
situations, a failure to act can be considered blameworthy. Ashworth 
writes: “Although the paradigm of criminal liability is a prohibition on 
the culpable doing of a certain act, all systems of criminal law seem to 
include offences of omission. Some will have been drafted expressly so 
as to penalise an omission, e.g. ‘failing to . . . ,’ usually in the context 
of an undertaking or activity such as running a business or driving a 
motor vehicle. There may be other offences worded in a way which 
leaves open the possibility that they may be committed by omission as 
well as by acts. References to omissions should not, of course, be taken 
to imply that we may be said to omit to do everything that we do not do 
each day. The term ‘omission’ is properly applied only to failure to do 
things which there is some kind of duty to do, or at least things which 
it is reasonable to expect a person to do (on the basis of some 
relationship or role). The scope of such duties is a major question for 
the legislature when considering criminal law reform and for the courts 
when developing the common law or interpreting statutes.”3

According to Williams, the “proper” attitude towards 
criminal liability for pure omissions should be as follows: First, omissions 
liability should be exceptional and thoroughly justified in each case. 
Secondly, it must be mandated by clear statutory language. Verbs that 
primarily refer to active actions and prohibit them should not be 
interpreted to include omissions unless the statute implies it genuinely and 
not superficially. Thirdly, the maximum penalties for active misconduct 
should not be applied automatically to corresponding omissions. Instead, 
penalties for omissions should be carefully considered for each specific 
case.4 
10. 
 
Indeed, not all crimes can be committed by omission. 
Some offences would appear not to be capable of commission by 
omission. Therefore, the courts consider the following four issues when 
imposing liability for omissions:5 
(i) 
Is D’s conduct properly classified as an omission or an act? 
(ii) 
If the accused’s conduct is regarded as an ‘omission’, 
whether the particular offence is one for which an omission can 
ground liability?  
(iii) 
If an omission is a basis for liability under the offence, 
whether D was under a duty to act? 
(iv) 
Where the definition of the crime requires proof that D 
‘caused’ a certain result, can he be said to have caused that result by 
doing nothing? 
11. 
 
McCutcheon classifies omission offences into three 
categories.6 The first may be called pure omission offences, where the 
accused does not commit any act. These offences are mostly statutory 
and usually involve duties of a general public nature (such as the duty 
to pay tax) or are assigned to specific groups of people (such as parents’ 
duties under child neglect laws). The second category consists of hybrid 
offences that contain elements of both act and omission, such as driving 
without insurance and operating machinery without prescribed safety 
features. The third category includes offences where the accused’s 
failure to perform a duty directly results in the prohibited outcome. For 
example, in R v. Dytham, [1979] QB 722, a police officer was found

guilty of willful misconduct in public office for failing to intervene 
while a member of the public was violently attacked. 
12. 
 
Albeit an infraction might be committed by omission, this 
does not imply that everyone is under a duty to act. The courts have 
identified several categories in which a duty to act arises. There may be 
some overlap, but we can classify recognized duties according to their 
recognized sources as follows: (a) duties arising from statute (i.e. where 
it expressly states that failure to perform a particular duty imposed by 
it constitutes an offence), (b) duties arising from contract, (c) duties 
based on a relationship, (d) duties arising from the assumption of 
responsibility, and (e) duties arising where accused has created a 
danger. 
13. 
 
The courts have long held that murder and manslaughter 
can be committed by omission.7 Most cases of homicide by omission 
have resulted in manslaughter convictions, but in Gibbins and Proctor, 
(1918) 13 Cr. App. R 134, the accused were found guilty of murdering 
a child. In that case, Walter Gibbins and Edith Proctor lived with 
Gibbins’ seven-year-old daughter, Nelly, and other children. The 
children were healthy except for Nelly, who was kept upstairs apart 
from the others and was starved to death. There was evidence that 
Proctor despised Nelly and cursed and physically assaulted her, from 
which the jury could infer that she had a very strong interest in Nelly’s 
death. Gibbins had regular employment and was earning good wages, 
which he gave to Proctor. The court ruled that the man breached the 
duty parents owe their children. The woman had assumed a duty 
towards the child by taking money to buy food. 
14. 
 
Although the courts have accepted that homicide can be 
perpetrated by omission, they have assumed that assault or battery 
requires an act.8  
15. 
 
Section 321 PPC must be interpreted according to the 
principles discussed above. It makes a person legally accountable not 
only for engaging in an illegal act that results in the death of another

person but also for failing to take measures within his power to prevent 
such an event from happening if he owes a duty of care. In order to 
succeed, the prosecution must establish a causal relationship between 
the accused’s conduct (or omission) and the incident resulting in a 
person’s death. In other words, it must demonstrate that the incident 
would not have happened but for the accused’s actions. (This is also 
known as the “but for” test). Second, the prosecution must establish 
legal causation, which is closely connected to the notions of 
responsibility and culpability. Williams explains: 
“When one has settled the question of but-for causation, the further 
test to be applied to the but-for cause in order to qualify it for legal 
recognition is not a test of causation but a moral reaction. The 
question is whether the result can fairly be said to be imputable to 
the defendant … If the term ‘cause’ must be used, it can best be 
distinguished in this meaning as the ‘imputable’ or ‘responsible’ or 
‘blamable’ cause, to indicate the value-judgment involved.”9 
16. 
 
As adumbrated, under section 322 PPC, Qatl-bis-sabab is 
punishable with Diyat only. However, per Schedule II of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898, the offence is cognizable and non-bailable. 
This provision was introduced following the amendment of Chapter 
XVI of the Pakistan Penal Code (Of offences affecting the human body) 
in 1990. The issue of whether an accused is entitled to pre-arrest or 
post-arrest bail straightaway as of right in such a case is highly 
contentious. One set of decisions holds that he is not. According to this 
point of view, the legislature’s intention is clear. Since the offence 
under section 322 PPC is cognizable, the accused can be arrested 
without a warrant, and because it is non-bailable, he can be held in jail 
pending his trial unless he presents a case for bail. The mere fact that 
the offence is penalized by Diyat is not sufficient by itself for his 
release.10 The second series of cases holds that an accused cannot be 
sent behind bars when charged with an offence under section 322 PPC 
because, even if he pleads guilty at his trial and is convicted, he can 
only be imprisoned if he fails to pay the Diyat sum. His incarceration 
would, therefore, amount to punishing him before conviction.11 In any 
event, the courts are liberal in admitting an accused to post-arrest bail

on the grounds that the offence under section 322 PPC does not fall 
within the prohibitory clause of section 497(1) Cr.P.C.12 
17. 
 
When the courts grant bail, they generally rely upon the 
following observations of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in  
Syed Muhammad Firdaus and others v. The State (2005 SCMR 784): 
“In addition to the above, it is to be noted that learned trial court 
vide order, dated 19th January 2004, summoned him and Dr. 
Sajid Hussain (petitioner No.2) being accused for the offence 
under section 319 PPC but surprisingly on 17th December, 2004 
on the basis of the same material, they were charged for Qatl-bis-
sabab under section 322/34 PPC, which is a non-bailable offence 
as per schedule of Cr.P.C. It seems that the learned Judge could 
not decide whether it is a case under section 319 or 322 PPC. Be 
that as it may, in any case, they shall not be punished ultimately 
for death or life imprisonment as under section 322 PPC. the 
sentence is of Diyat; therefore, for this added reason as well, 
concession of bail cannot be denied to them under the law.” 
18. 
 
Firdaus had its peculiar facts. On 25.7.2003, the District 
and Sessions Judge, Sialkot, went to inspect the District Jail with some 
judicial and other officers when five prisoners attacked them with 
deadly weapons, killing three and wounding another five. Syed 
Shehryar Bukhari, one of those injured, succumbed to his injuries later. 
The petitioners were doctors who were accused of being negligent in 
providing adequate medical treatment to Shehryar. The Supreme Court 
admitted the accused doctors to pre-arrest bail primarily due to a lack 
of incriminating evidence. Its observation regarding section 322 PPC 
(reproduced in the preceding paragraph) was undoubtedly one of the 
grounds for the decision, but it is respectfully pointed out that there is 
no elaborate discussion on the above-mentioned issue. 
19. 
 
I could lay my hands only on a few cases which examine 
section 322 PPC in detail. In Haji Maa Din and another v. The State 
and another (1998 SCMR 1528), the accused sought post-arrest bail in 
a case registered under sections 336, 337-F(v) and 34 PPC, which was 
denied up to the High Court. They raised two questions before the 
Supreme Court: (i) Whether a person accused of an offence punishable 
with Qisas, or in the alternative Arsh (Diyat), can be detained in prison 
                                                 
12 Muhammad Nadeem v. The State (1998 MLD 1537); Yousaf Khan v. The State (2000 PCr.LJ 203); Tariq Mahmood 
v. The State (2005 YLR 1968); Ghulam Ali v. The State (2017 YLR Note 339); Ameer Khan v. The State  
(2018 YLR Note 283); Muhammad Shafi v. The State and another (2020 PCr.LJ 1530); and Israr Hussain Shah v.

pending the decision of his case? and (ii) Whether and when a person 
accused of an offence punishable with Qisas, or in the alternative Arsh 
(Diyat), can also be punished with imprisonment? Seeking support 
from the treatise of Abdul Kadir Audah’s treatise, the Supreme Court 
answered the first question in the affirmative. It held that an accused 
might be detained in jail pending investigation or decision if the 
interests of justice and public good warrant it. The relevant excerpt 
from the judgment is reproduced below:

The Supreme Court did not consider deciding the second 
question in those proceedings necessary because it was a bail matter. 
However, it observed that section 337-N(2) PPC specifies, amongst 
others, the instances and conditions in which a prison sentence should 
be handed down as Ta’zir. The following factors must be taken into 
account when determining whether to impose a Ta’zir punishment: the 
facts and circumstances of the case, the type of harm/injury caused, the 
weapon used, and the manner in which the offence was committed – 
whether it was the brutal or shocking, outrageous to the public

conscience or adversely affected harmony among different sections of 
the people. 
20.  
 
In Ali Muhammad v. The State (PLD 2009 Lahore 312), 
a Full Bench of this Court was called upon to resolve the conflicting 
views of different Benches on the import of section 337-N(2) PPC13 and 
give an authoritative opinion on what would be its effect when an 
accused applies for bail in offences under Chapter XVI of the Penal 
Code. The Full Bench stated that even if the offence is bailable, an 
accused person can be arrested during the investigation phase, but he is 
entitled to be admitted to bail as of right. It held that the arrest of an 
accused person for investigation cannot be equated with the punishment 
of a prison sentence, which may be imposed on him upon his conviction 
after the trial. The Full Bench further stated that when considering a 
post-arrest bail, the court should treat hurt cases punishable only by 
Arsh or Daman differently from those cases where the offence attracts 
the optional additional sentence of imprisonment as Ta’zir because the 
accused “is a previous convict, habitual or hardened, desperate or 
dangerous criminal or the offence has been committed by him in the 
name or on the pretext of honour” as mentioned in subsection (2) of 
section 337-N PPC. The court may legitimately refuse bail to an 
accused person falling in the second catogory, taking into account the 
specific circumstances of the case. 
                                                 
13 Section 337-N PPC is reproduced below for ready reference: 
337-N. Cases in which qisas for hurt shall not be enforced. (1) The qisas for a hurt shall not be enforced 
in the following cases, namely: 
(a) 
when the offender dies before execution of qisas; 
(b) 
when the organ of the offender liable to qisas is lost before the execution of qisas: 
  
Provided that the offender shall be liable to arsh, and may also be liable to ta’zir provided 
for the kind of hurt caused by him; 
(c) 
when the victim waives the qisas or compounds the offence with Badal-i-Sulh; or 
(d) 
when the right of qisas devolves on the person who cannot claim qisas against the offender 
under this Chapter: 
Provided that the offender shall be liable to arsh, if there is any wali other than the offender and if 
there is no wali other than the offender he shall be liable to ta’zir provided for the kind of hurt caused by him. 
(2) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Chapter in all cases of hurt, the Court may, having regard 
to the kind of hurt caused by him in addition to payment of arsh, award taʼzir to an offender who is a previous 
convict, habitual or hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal or the offence has been committed by him in 
the name or on the pretext of the honour. 
Provided that the toʼzir shall not be less than one third of the maximum imprisonment provided for 
the hurt caused if the offender is a previous convict, habitual, hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal or 
if the offence has been committed by him in the name or on the pretext of honour.

The Sindh High Court made some very pertinent 
observations in Atta Muhammad v. The State (2005 PCr.LJ 1648), a 
case in which the accused killed a motorcyclist and damaged two cars 
in an accident while driving a transport bus. He was booked under 
sections 322, 427, and 279 PPC. He applied for post-arrest bail, 
contending that all the offences were bailable except the one punishable 
under section 322 PPC, but the sentence provided thereunder is Diyat 
only. The Sindh High Court dismissed his plea ruling as follows: 
“12. 
The sentence provided under section 322 PPC is simply 
Diyat. Nevertheless, the legislature has made the offence non-
bailable. It is not the function of the court to challenge and examine 
the wisdom of Parliament as to why this offence has been made non-
bailable. The laws are made by the Parliament after taking into 
consideration several aspects available in the society. From the 
simple reading of the above provision of law it appears that the 
Parliament appear to be sensitive about the unlawful actions of the 
persons, who committed such action. It will be further noticed that 
the offence under section 320 PPC is bailable, which is punishable 
up to ten years even if, in the accident, a large number of people lose 
their lives though the punishment provided thereunder falls under 
the prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. It appears that the 
Parliament took a view that because the action was lawful but it was 
due to some accident, the offence was committed; therefore, the said 
offence has been made bailable. Thus, for each offence, the 
Parliament have taken a different yardstick for making an offence 
bailable or non-bailable irrespective of the punishment provided 
thereunder.” 
“13. 
Section 497 Cr.P.C. deals with the grant of bail. In the 
Chapter of bail, Parliament has made two provisions, viz. sections 
496 and 497. The former deals with the cases of bailable offences 
whereas the latter deals with the cases of non-bailable offences. 
Under the latter provision, a discretion has been given to the court 
to release or not to release an accused person in a case of non-
bailable offence, but the court has been debarred from releasing an 
accused person if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that 
the accused is guilty of offence punishable with death or 
imprisonment for life or 10 years. As such, the discretion has to be 
exercised judiciously and keeping in view the nature of the offence, 
its impact on the society and persons directly affected and the 
wisdom of Parliament.”

another  
(2011 SCMR 1227), the accused killed five persons by rash and 
negligent driving. The Supreme Court refused him post-arrest bail, 
holding that the bail application of an accused has to be decided on the 
basis of the nature of the allegation levelled against him and the 
evidence collected. The offence under section 322 PPC is not bailable, 
and the grant of bail is a discretionary relief, which cannot be claimed 
as of right.

The principle that emerges from the above discussion is 
that the offence of Qatl-bis-sabab being non-bailable, an accused 
cannot seek bail as of right. The court has to decide every bail 
application judiciously considering its facts, the nature of allegations 
and the evidence available on record, and the principles regulating 
refusal or grant of pre- and post-arrest bail. 
24. 
 
The considerations for granting pre-arrest and post-arrest 
bail are different.14 The Supreme Court has given some important 
guidelines for pre-arrest bails in Rana Muhammad Arshad v. 
Muhammad Rafique and another (PLD 2009 SC 427), Malik Nazir 
Ahmed v. Syed Shams-ul-Abbas and others (PLD 2016 SC 171),  
and Shahzada Arfat alias Qaiser v. The State and another  
(PLD 2021 SC 708). Malik Nazir Ahmed is particularly significant. It 
was a case under section 489-F PPC, and the High Court admitted the 
accused to pre-arrest bail, stating that the police did not need his 
custody to recover any money. The Supreme Court disapproved of this 
“generalized” approach, ruling that it “militated” against the scheme of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure. It held that if the High Court’s 
reasoning was adopted, pre-arrest bail could not be denied to an 
accused, even in cases of rape, murder by strangling, or terrorist 
planning. The arrest of an accused person during the investigation of a 
criminal case is meant not only to effect recovery from his possession 
but also to investigate the circumstances of the case and collect 
evidence. Recovery, where required, is merely one of the components 
of the investigation. The Supreme Court pointed out that the High 
Court’s decision also ignores the consideration of mala fide on the part 
of the police or the complainant party, which is one of the prerequisites 
for pre-arrest bail in a case involving a non-bailable offence. 
25. 
 
Regarding post-arrest bail, section 497 Cr.P.C. outlines the 
circumstances when a court may admit an accused to bail in cases 
involving non-bailable offences. Furthermore, in Tariq Bashir and 
others v. The State (PLD 1995 SC 34) and a chain of subsequent 
                                                 
14 Shah Nawaz v. The State (2005 SCMR 1899); and Muhammad Sadiq and others v. The State and another  
(2015 SCMR 1394).

decisions,15 the Supreme Court has ruled that where an offence does not 
fall under the prohibitory clause, accepting bail is a rule and the 
rejection is an exception.  
26. 
 
The offence under section 322 PPC does not fall within the 
prohibitory clause since its maximum punishment is Diyat. 
27. 
 
Let’s now turn to the case at hand. The Petitioner operates 
a private hostel in Riaz Colony, Bahawalpur, without the permission of 
the appropriate authorities. Its building plan is also not approved. The 
Deputy Prosecutor General has submitted documents showing that the 
Building Inspector, Municipal Corporation Bahawalpur, issued him 
notices multiple times. According to the prosecution, the hostel’s water 
tank on the roof was continually leaking. The students repeatedly asked 
the Petitioner to get it repaired but he ignored them. The water 
eventually damaged the building, which was already in bad shape, and 
on 29.04.2023, the roof collapsed, killing Saliha Munawar and Maida 
Iqbal and injuring Faiza Zafar and Ayesha Nawaz. The Petitioner had 
a duty to ensure the safety of the girls residing in his hostel and protect 
them from harm. His failure to get the water tank fixed caused the 
incident of 29th April. PWs have recorded their statements under 
section 161 Cr.P.C. supporting the prosecution case. The Petitioner has 
not provided any evidence to this Court that would indicate that the FIR 
against him is driven by ulterior motives. 
28. 
 
The Petitioner does not have a case for pre-arrest bail. This 
application is dismissed.
