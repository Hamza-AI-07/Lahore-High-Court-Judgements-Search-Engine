====== 
       Through this petition under Article 199 
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 the petitioners Dr. Iqrar Khan and Ch. 
Muhammad Hussain have sought quashing of 
impugned FIR No.41/2020, in respect of offence 
under Sections 409,468,471 & 420 PPC read with 
Section 5(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 
(PCA), registered at P.S. ACE, Region Faisalabad.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits 
that the impugned FIR is a result of malafide and 
ulterior motives; that petitioner No.1 served as Vice 
Chancellor of the University of Agriculture, 
Faisalabad (University) for two terms consecutively; 
that during his term University went  through an 
exceptional growth phase; that enrollments of 
students went up from 8000 to 25000, the recurring 
budget rose from rupees 700 million to 7 billion, 
research fund grew from rupees 300 million  to 
3000 million and the University ranking went up in 
the top 100 QS World subject category, a distinction 
that no other University in the country has achieved 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        2 
 
yet; that after completion of his two tenures, the 
University has advertised the post of Vice 
Chancellor again and the petitioner also applied for 
the said post; that respondent No.5 was also 
contesting candidate for the said post; that 
Government of the Punjab constituted a Search 
Committee to consider suitability of the candidates, 
and the petitioner stood at Sr.No.1 of the merit list; 
that the Chief Minister in derogation of merit, 
appointed respondent No.5, who was lower in merit 
as Vice Chancellor of the University; that the 
petitioner challenged the appointment of respondent 
No.5 before this Court by way of Writ Petition 
No.34743/2019; that due to that grudge respondent 
No.5 while holding the post of Vice Chancellor, in 
order to tarnish the image of the petitioner and 
influence upon the judicial proceedings, constituted 
an 
unlawful 
probe 
committee 
under 
the 
convenorship of respondent No.6 vide notification 
dated 03.06.2019; that the said committee without 
issuing any notice to the petitioners and affording 
them an opportunity to explain their position by 
preparing forged and fictitious record, held the 
petitioners guilty  of making adhoc/contract/ regular 
appointments, abuse of official powers and drawing 
of honorarium without the permission of competent 
authority/Chancellor within eleven days of the 
constitution of the committee, that on the basis of 
findings of probe committee initially respondent 
No.8 filed a complaint before Anti Corruption 
Establishment, (ACE), who subsequently withdrew 
the same by filing an affidavit; that thereafter 
respondent No.9, who has nothing to do with the 
internal affairs of the University was managed by 
respondent No.5, who again filed application before 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        3 
 
the ACE on the similar charges; that the inquiry 
remained pending for a considerable period of time 
and in the meanwhile, this Court vide judgment 
dated 17.01.2020 passed in aforesaid writ petition 
declared the appointment of respondent No.5 for the 
post of Vice Chancellor as illegal and unlawful and 
direction was issued to the competent authority to 
notify the petitioner as Vice Chancellor; that 
respondent No.5 challenged the order of learned 
Single Judge in Chamber in the Intra Court Appeal, 
which was accepted by the learned Division Bench 
vide judgment dated 05.03.2020 and respondent 
No.5 was restored as Vice Chancellor; that being 
aggrieved the petitioner challenged the vires of 
judgment of the learned Division Bench before the 
Apex Court, by filing C.Ps. No.916-L and 1768 of 
2020; that the Apex Court while granting leave to 
appeal suspended the operation of the orders of the 
learned 
Division 
Bench 
vide 
order 
dated 
07.09.2020; that on smelling success of the 
petitioner, respondent No.5 while using his 
influence just after nineteen days of leave granting 
order of the Apex Court got lodged the impugned 
FIR; that sole purpose of lodging of impugned FIR 
was just to influence the judicial proceedings before 
the Apex Court and creating hurdle in the way of 
the petitioner for the post of Vice Chancellor; that 
prior to lodging of FIR, ACE coerced the petitioner 
to withdraw the CPs from the Apex Court; that 
regarding the same allegations the matter has 
already been thoroughly investigated by the NAB 
authorities, who vide letter dated 28.08.2018 
recommended 
closure 
of 
investigation; 
that 
launching of investigation on the same allegations 
by the Anti Corruption Establishment is in clear 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        4 
 
contravention of Section 18(d) of the National 
Accountability Ordinance, 1999; that the impugned 
FIR tantamounts to double jeopardy, which is 
barred under Article 13(a) of the Constitution; that 
even 
otherwise 
during 
two 
consecutive 
investigations, one conducted by the JIT, constituted 
by the order of learned Special Judge, Anti 
Corruption, Faisalabad, the petitioners have been 
found innocent and the cancellation report, duly 
approved by the Director General, ACE and 
forwarded by the prosecution department has been 
submitted before the Trial Court; that despite elapse 
of almost eleven months the Trial Court has not 
decided the fate of said cancellation report; that 
after giving clean chit to the petitioners during 
investigation, there is no chance of their conviction, 
as such impugned FIR is liable to be quashed.  
4. 
On the contrary, learned counsels for 
respondents No.5 & 6 submitted that impugned 
FIR was lodged against the petitioners, pursuant to 
the recommendations of the Probe Committee; that 
sufficient incriminating material in the shape of 
documentary evidence is available against the 
petitioners; that the allegations mentioned in the 
impugned FIR were neither investigated nor were 
the same subject matter of the investigation 
conducted by the NAB, as such there is no bar for 
the ACE to investigate into the allegations; that the 
cancellation  report has already been submitted in 
the Trial Court and fixed for hearing, as such the 
petitioners may be advised to follow said 
proceedings. In the end, a prayer has been made 
for dismissal of instant writ petition. 
5. 
Learned Assistant Advocate General, while 
conceding the fact that the petitioners have been 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        5 
 
given clean chit by the ACE in two consecutive 
investigations has submitted that since the 
cancellation report is pending before the Trial 
Court, the right course for the petitioners was to 
approach the said court for early decision of the 
cancellation report and then if aggrieved avail 
alternate remedy of filing application before the 
said Court for their pre-mature acquittal.  
6. 
I have heard the arguments advanced by the 
learned counsel for the petitioners, learned 
Assistant Advocate General assisted by learned 
counsel for respondents No.5 & 6 and gone 
through the record.  
7. 
By way of this petition the petitioners have 
invoked extraordinary Constitutional jurisdiction 
of this Court for quashing of aforementioned 
impugned FIR. Ordinarily, time and again this 
Court has shown reluctance in interfering in the 
ongoing investigating process on the well 
cherished 
principle 
that 
the 
functions 
of 
Investigating 
Agency 
and 
judiciary 
are 
complementary and not overlapping and the 
combination of individual liberty with  due 
observance of law and order can only be achieved 
if both the organs are allowed to function 
independently. However, this principle in any way 
cannot be construed an absolute bar on the power 
of this Court in quashing of FIR in cases where the 
Court is satisfied that investigation is launched 
with malafide intention and without jurisdiction. In 
case reported as “Shahnaz Begum ..Vs.. Hon’ble 
Judge of the High Court of Sindh and 
Balochistan” (PLD 1971 SC 677), wherein it has 
been laid down as under:- 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        6 
 
“If an investigation is launched mala fide or 
is 
clearly 
beyond 
the 
jurisdiction 
of 
the 
investigating agencies concerned then it may be 
possible for the action of the Investigating Agencies 
to be corrected by proper proceedings either under 
Article 98 of the Constitution of 1962 or under the 
provisions of section 491 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code, if the applicant is in the latter case in 
detention, but not by invoking the inherent power 
under section 561-A of the Criminal Procedure 
Code.” 
Similarly, in case reported as “Anwar 
Ahmad Khan ..Vs.. The State (1996 SCMR 24)”, it 
has been laid down as under:- 
“ It is well settled principle that where 
investigation is malfide or without jurisdiction, the 
High Court in exercise of its Constitutional 
jurisdiction under Article 199 is competent to 
correct such proceedings and pass necessary order 
to ensure justice and fair play. The Investigating 
Authorities do not have the entire and total authority 
of running investigation according to their whims”.  
In case reported as Raja Rustam Ali Khan 
..Vs.. Muhammad Hanif (1997 SCMR 2008), it has 
been observed as under:- 
“It would, therefore, be seen that if an 
investigation 
is 
launched 
malafide 
by 
the 
Investigating Agencies, the same is open to 
correction 
by 
invoking 
the 
constitutional 
jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 of 
the Constitution.” 
In case reported as “Muhammad Irshad 
Khan ..Vs..  Chairman, National Accountability 
Bureau and 2 others (2007 P Cr. LJ) 1957 the 
learned   Division Bench of Sindh High Court, 
observed as under:- 
“ Thus the consensus of the Honourable 
Supreme Court of Pakistan from the year 1971 and 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        7 
 
onward is that High Court  has jurisdiction under 
Article 199 of the Constitution and competent to 
correct such proceedings and pass necessary orders 
to ensure justice and fairplay. The Investigating 
Authorities do not have the entire and total authority 
of running investigation according to their whims, 
therefore, if the investigation is launched malafidely 
or beyond the jurisdiction of investigating agency, 
then the same can be corrected and appropriate 
orders can be passed.” 
The question what is “ malafide” has been 
answered by the Apex Court in case reported as 
“The Federation of Pakistan through Secretary 
Establishment Division, Government of Pakistan, 
Rawalpindi .V.. Saeed Ahmad Khan (PLD 1974 SC 
151) in the following way:- 
“ Mala fides” literally means “in bad faith”. 
Action taken in bad faith is usually taken 
maliciously in fact, that is to say, in which the 
person taking the action does so out of personal 
motives either to hurt the person against whom the 
action is taken or to benefit oneself. Action taken in 
colourable exercise of powers, that is to say, for 
collateral purposes not authorized by the law under 
which the action is taken or action taken in fraud of 
the law are also malafide. It is necessary, therefore, 
for a person alleging that an action has been taken 
mala fide to show that the person responsible for 
taking the action has been motivated by any one of 
the considerations mentioned above.” 
Recently, in case reported as “F.I.A. through 
Director General, FIA and others .Vs. Syed Hamid 
Ali Shah and others (PLD 2023 SC 265)”, the 
Apex Court has observed as under:- 
“Article 199 (1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution 
empowers the High Courts to judicially review the 
acts done or proceedings taken by the persons 
performing functions in connection with the affairs 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        8 
 
of the Federation, a Province or a local authority 
and if find such acts or proceedings to have been 
done or taken without lawful authority, to declare 
them to be so and of no legal effect. The registration 
of an FIR and the doing of an investigation are the 
acts of officials of the police department ( a 
provincial law enforcement agency) who perform 
functions in connection with the affairs of a 
Province and are thus amenable to the jurisdiction 
of the High Court under Article 199 (1)(a)(ii) of the 
Constitution. The High Courts can declare such acts 
of the police officers, to have been made without 
lawful authority and of no legal effect if they are 
found to be so and can also make appropriate 
incidental or consequential order to effectuate its 
decision, such as quashing the FIR and investigation 
proceedings.” 
8. 
On the touchstone of above criteria, I have 
to determine the fate of instant case. From the 
contents of the impugned FIR, the allegations 
mentioned therein can be bifurcated in three parts.  
Firstly, petitioner No.1 (hereinafter shall be called 
as VC) made irregular appointments without 
advertisement in the press. Secondly, VC received 
honorarium of Rs.9.12 million without the 
approval of the Chancellor. Thirdly, VC draw 
double salary at a time as VC and as Project 
Director, USP, CAS, AFS.  
9. 
It is very shocking to note that there was no 
allegation against petitioner No.2, former Registrar 
of the University, who undisputedly neither has 
any role in appointments of the employees in the 
University nor there was any allegation against 
him qua financial embezzlement or misuse of 
authority but despite this fact he was booked in 
this case. Apparently, at the time of lodging of 
impugned FIR, arms of the ACE were twisted by 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        9 
 
some unknown power, who without taking note of 
above aspect of the matter booked petitioner No.2 
in the instant case.  
10. 
Now coming to the case of VC.  First of all, 
I would like to discuss the allegation against him 
qua making of irregular appointments without 
advertisement in the newspapers. It is an admitted 
fact that the University is an autonomous body and 
its affairs are governed under the University of 
Agriculture, Faisalabad Act, 1973. Section 15 (4) 
of the Act deals with the powers of Vice 
Chancellor.  Its clauses (i),(ii) and (viii) relevant 
for resolving the dispute reads as under:- 
i. 
to create and fill temporary posts for a 
period not exceeding six months; 
ii. 
to sanction all expenditure provided for in 
the approved budget and to re-appropriate 
funds within the same major head of 
expenditure. 
iii. 
to appoint employees in National Pay Scales 
1 to 16 
Similarly, by way of Section 15(3) of the Act ibid 
certain emergency powers were also conferred 
upon the Vice Chancellor which provides as 
under:- 
  
15(3) “Subject to such conditions as may be 
prescribed, the Vice Chancellor may, in an 
emergency, take an action which is not 
otherwise in the competence of the Vice 
Chancellor but is in the competence of any 
other Authority”.  
15(3a) The Vice Chancellor shall, within 
seven days of taking an action under sub-
Section (3), submit a report of the action 
taken to the Pro-Chancellor and to the 
members 
of 
the 
Syndicate; 
and 
the 
Syndicate shall, within forty-five days of 
such an action of the Vice Chancellor, pass 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        10 
 
such orders as the Syndicate deems 
appropriate”. 
It is thus manifestly clear that under the University 
Act the Vice Chancellor is not only empowered to 
create and fill temporary posts not beyond the 
period of six months, sanction all expenditures but 
also appoint employee in National Pay Scale 1 to 
16. Similarly, in emergency the law has 
empowered him to take action which is even not in 
his 
competence. 
During 
two 
consecutive 
investigations, 
one 
conducted 
by 
the 
JIT 
constituted by the order of learned Special Judge, 
Anti Corruption, Faisalabad, it came on surface 
that out of the list of 608 alleged irregular 
appointments, there was double entry of nine 
employees, whereas, out of the rest 599 employees 
126 employees were appointed by the former Vice 
Chancellors. It further came on surface that though 
certain appointments were made by the VC on 
temporary/adhoc basis, while exercising his 
powers conferred under the Act but he did not 
made even a single appointment on regular basis 
without the advertisement in the press or deviating 
the proper procedure during his tenures. 
A lot of emphasis was laid on the point that 
though the VC is empowered to make adhoc 
appointments but only for a period of six months 
but he extended the period of various employees 
beyond the period of six months. During 
investigation, it came on surface that it was long 
standing policy of the University approved by the 
Syndicate that the Adhoc arrangements are 
renewable after six months for another six months. 
However, Investigating Teams could not find even 
a single instance where the VC had made regular 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        11 
 
appointment without the approval of the Syndicate, 
as such there left no room to assume that the VC 
while making any appointments has derogated any 
law or misused his authority. It is a very 
unfortunate situation. Impugned FIR was lodged 
pursuant to the findings of Probe Committee of the 
University, who was constituted by the then Vice 
Chancellor, whose eligibility to hold the post was 
challenged by the petitioner before this Court and 
said committee within eleven days of its 
constitution held the VC guilty without even 
affording him a single opportunity to explain his 
position. Had it been done so the material 
presented by the VC to the Investigating Officer/ 
JIT showing that all what has been done in the 
process of appointments of the employees was 
within the parameters of law, then there might be 
no reason for involving the VC in the instant 
criminal case on such a fake charge. The conduct 
of the probe committee headed by respondent No.6 
lacks transparency and it seems that it played in 
the 
hand 
of 
incumbent 
Vice 
Chancellor/ 
respondent No.5 and in order to please him 
recorded the findings which were contrary to the 
record.  It is also important to note that neither any 
employee came on surface complaining that he 
obtained the job after giving money to the VC nor 
any contesting candidate lodged any complaint that 
his selection was not made despite falling on 
merits. In the absence of above, I am unable to 
understand how the offence U/S 409 PPC and 
Section 5(2) of PCA is attracted in the instant case. 
In case of FIA through D.G. FIA supra the Apex 
Court has observed as under:- 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        12 
 
“The argument of the learned counsel for 
the petitioner is totally misconceived, that the 
authority conferred upon the accused officers, who 
granted the illegal upgradations, was a trust and by 
misusing that authority, they have committed the 
offence of criminal breach of trust punishable under 
section 409 P.P.C. and the offence of criminal 
misconduct punishable under section 5(2), P.C.A. 
No doubt, the powers of the public servants are like 
trust conferred upon them and they should exercise 
them fairly, honestly and in good faith as a trustee; 
but the entrustment of the power to upgrade his 
subordinate officials is not equivalent to the 
entrustment of property as mentioned in section 
405, P.P.C. and its misuse, or use in violation of the 
relevant rules and regulations, does not constitute 
the cognizable offences punishable under section 
409 P.P.C. and section 5(2), P.C.A.” 
 From the above discussion, it is manifestly 
clear that the VC has not committed any criminal 
act for making appointments and apparently for 
this reason in two successive investigations, he 
was given clean chit.  
11. 
Next allegation set out in the impugned FIR 
is that he received honorarium of Rs.9.12 million 
without the approval of the Chancellor. The case 
of the prosecution was that according to the terms 
and conditions of the appointment of VC only the 
Chancellor is vested with an authority to grant any 
perks and privilege to him, but he on its own draw 
the honorarium. I think the prosecution has 
intermingled term ‘perks and privileges’ with the 
‘Honorarium’ which has entirely and distinct 
feature. 
The 
term 
‘Honorarium’ 
has 
been 
explained by the Apex Court in case reported as 
“Mirza Muhammad Tufail ..Vs..District Returning 
Officer and others  ( P L D 2007 Supreme Court 
16)” in the following manner: 
“The honorarium has been defined in Corpus Juris 
Secundem Vol. 44 at page 325 as under:-- 
In common understanding, the word means 
a voluntary reward for that for which no 
remuneration could be collected by law, hence a 
voluntary payment for a service rendered, an 
expression of gratitude for which an action cannot 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        13 
 
be 
maintained, 
a 
voluntary 
donation, 
in 
consideration of services which admit of no 
compensation in money. While it has been said to 
denote a compensatory payment, it may, be context, 
be construed as a gift. (emphasis supplied)" 
 
On the contrary, term ‘privilege’ has been 
explained by the Apex Court in judgment reported 
as “Karamat Hussain and others ..VS.. Muhammad 
Zaman and others P L D 1987 Supreme Court 
139”  in the following manner: 
“A privilege is some particular benefit or 
advantage conferred on a person or a class of 
persons which other citizens do not enjoy. 
(emphasis supplied)” 
 
In the light of the above definitions, we may 
conclude that perks and privileges are peculiar 
benefits for which the Vice Chancellor was 
entitled while holding such post, whereas, 
honorarium is not given to a Vice Chancellor by 
virtue of his post, but the same was a voluntary 
payment being made in recognition of meritorious 
services of an employee.  Even otherwise, 
admittedly, the budget of the University was 
sanctioned by the Syndicate and Senate which was 
headed by the Chancellor and undisputedly the 
budget for the period in which the VC drew 
honorarium was duly sanctioned by the Syndicate 
and Senate, as such it cannot be said that the 
honorarium was drawn by him without the 
sanction of the Chancellor. Moreover, during 
investigation it came on surface that it was a long 
standing practice in the University that the Vice 
Chancellors alongwith others drew honorarium 
without the sanction of the Chancellor. JIT pointed 
out names of former Vice Chancellors Prof. Dr. 
Riaz Hussain Qureshi, Prof. Dr. Bashir Ahmad, 
Prof. Dr. Muhammad Iqbal Zafar, Prof. Dr. Zafar 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        14 
 
Iqbal and Prof. Dr. Muhammad Ashraf, who in 
their respective tenures received honorarium, 
therefore, singling out the petitioner in this charge 
is not only discriminatory but also shows malafide 
and ulterior motive on the part of the authority, 
who launched probe in this regard.  
12. 
 Now coming to third allegation that the VC 
drew double salary at a time as Vice Chancellor 
and Project Director of “U.S Pakistan, Center for 
Advanced Studies in Agriculture and Food 
Security, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad” 
(CAS). During investigation, it came on surface 
that the aforesaid project was started in the year 
2014 and in the agreement with the Government it 
was written that the VC shall took over the charge 
of said project as Chief of Party (COS) on 
completion of his tenure as Vice Chancellor on 22-
01-2017 with an overlapping period of one month 
to transition which started in December 2016.   
The tenure of the VC was going to expire on 
22.01.2017; therefore, he took over the charge as 
COS in December 2016. After expiry of his tenure 
as Vice Chancellor, the Governor/ Chancellor 
assigned him look after charge of the Vice 
Chancellor of the University. There is nothing on 
the record to suggest that duties of look after 
charge were assigned to the VC on his desire or 
request. In such an eventuality, VC was left with 
no option except to continue his services as COS 
and the Vice Chancellor simultaneously in 
compliance of the orders of the Governor/ 
Chancellor. During investigation, Treasurer of the 
University appeared before the Investigating 
Teams and in categorical terms denied that the VC 
ever received salaries of two posts at a time. After 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        15 
 
consulting with the record, Investigating Teams 
opined that the VC only drew single salary for the 
post of Vice Chancellor and till the holding of 
temporary charge of said post, he did not secure 
even a single penny as COS.  Record further 
evinces that the VC relinquished the charge of the 
office of Vice Chancellor on 08-08-2017.  The said 
project was supposed to continue till December 
2019 but due to change of hierarchy in USA the 
same was terminated within seven months of 
taking over its charge by the VC and due to that 
very reason USAID gave severance pay to all the 
employees of project including the VC, who at the 
time of receipt of said salary was not even 
employee of the University.   During investigation, 
it also came on surface that all the financial 
transactions were directly made by the US 
Embassy and not even a single penny was paid to 
the VC or other employees of USAID Project 
through the public account. There was not even a 
single iota of material from which it could be 
inferred that while holding the office of VC, he 
received any salary as Incharge of CAS, therefore, 
in two consecutive investigation, the Investigating 
Agency 
recommended 
droppage 
of 
the 
proceedings against the VC.  
13. 
 Moreso, despite being on merit the then 
Chief Minister denied appointment 
of the 
petitioner as Vice Chancellor, inter-alia, on the 
ground of lack of financial and administrative 
control during his previous tenures, which was 
challenged by the petitioner before this Court and 
finally the matter went to the Apex Court, who 
vide judgment dated 07.12.2020 passed in Civil 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        16 
 
Appeals No. 326-L & 327-L of 2020 brush aside 
such findings in the following manner:- 
“ The record further reveals that the 
Secretary Agriculture Department, Government of 
the Punjab was part of the Search Committee. The 
said Secretary is the Principal Accounting Officer 
of the Government of Punjab. He was a member of 
the Search Committee that placed the Appellant at 
Serial No.1 of the merit list. It is worth mentioning 
that the same Secretary has given the Appellant 10 
out of 10 marks in the category of “ Administrative 
and Financial Management”. Further the Appellant 
was given 45 marks in the Interview. As against 
this, the Respondent was given only 31 marks in the 
Interview. The same Secretary was part of the 
interview 
as 
well. 
Therefore, 
when 
the 
representative of the Government who had first 
hand knowledge of all material and relevant facts 
also gave highest marks to the Appellant and low 
marks to the Respondent, we do not see why the 
Appellant was not appointed and that too without 
cogent and convincing reasons.” 
The purpose of highlighting the above para 
is that if the VC has committed any financial 
embezzlement or misuse of authority in his 
previous tenures, the representative of the 
Government i.e. Secretary Agriculture, who had 
the first hand knowledge, was not supposed to 
award him ten out of ten marks in the 
“Administrative and Financial Management”.  
14. 
Besides above, it is evident from the record 
that regarding the same allegations the matter was 
thoroughly 
inquired 
by 
the 
National 
Accountability Bureau (NAB), who vide letter 
dated 28.08.2018 recommended closure of the 
inquiry. Now the question arises whether after 
closure of the inquiry by the NAB authorities, on 
the same allegations, ACE is vested with any 
power to re-open/ re-investigate the same. Before 
proceeding further it is appropriate to go through 
the provisions of Section 18(d) of NAO, 1999 
which reads as under:- 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        17 
 
“ 
The 
responsibility 
of 
inquiry 
into 
and 
investigation of an offence alleged to have been 
committed under the Ordinance shall rest on the 
NAB to the exclusion of any other agency or 
authority, unless any such agency or authority is 
required to do so by the Chairman NAB or by an 
officer of the NAB duly authorized by him.”  
 
Bare perusal of above section makes it 
abundantly clear that NAB authorities have 
exclusive 
jurisdiction 
to 
inquire 
into 
and 
investigate any offence which has been committed 
under the NAO, 1999 and once it assumes the 
jurisdiction, no other agency is empowered to 
investigate the same subject matter, unless directed 
by the Chairman NAB or an officer authorized by 
him 
in 
this 
regard. 
Learned 
counsel 
for 
respondents No.5 & 6 argued that the investigation 
being conducted by the ACE is regarding the 
offences which were not subject matter of NAB 
Ordinance. I am not convinced with this argument. 
Impugned 
FIR 
was 
registered 
against 
the 
petitioner, under sections 409, 420,468 & 471 PPC 
read with Section 5(2) PCA, 1947. Sections 9(ix) 
& 9(xii) covered the offence under Sections 420 & 
409 PPC respectively. Similarly, the Schedule 
attached with the NAO, 1999 covers the offences 
committed under Section 468 & 471 PPC, 
whereas, Section 5(2) of PCA, 1947 is akin to the 
offences under Section 9(a) of the NAO, 1999, 
therefore, in any eventuality it cannot be said that 
the ACE had conducted investigation other than 
the offences upon which the NAB has already 
taken cognizance. In the above circumstances, I 
am of the considered view that launching of 
investigation by the ACE regarding the same 
subject matter, which has already been adjudicated 
upon and closed by the NAB, is in clear 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        18 
 
contravention of Section 18(d) of the Ordinance 
ibid and cannot be approved by this Court.  
15. 
Learned counsel for respondents No.5 & 6 
time and again argued that cancellation report of 
the impugned FIR is pending adjudication before 
the Trial Court and this Court vide order dated 
11.12.2023 passed in W.P.No.42718/23 filed by 
the complainant of the FIR, directed the Trial 
Court to decide the same after considering the 
findings of Special Judge, Anti Corruption in para 
No.21 of the order dated 08.05.2023, as such 
cancellation report ought to have been decided by 
the Trial Court. I am not convinced with this 
submission. Cancellation report and petition for 
quashing of FIR are entirely two different subjects 
falling under the jurisdiction of two different 
Courts, as such merely due to the pendency of 
Cancellation report before the Trial Court, 
proceedings in the quashment petition cannot be 
halted.  
16. 
Learned counsel further while placing on 
record  copy of order of this Court dated 
12.01.2021 passed in Writ Petition No.47510/20 
laid much emphasis that regarding the self same 
relief earlier the petitioner’s petition has been 
dismissed. I have anxiously gone through the said 
order and observed that subject matter in the said 
petition was not quashing of impugned FIR  rather 
proceedings initiated against the VC by various 
departments. Moreso, said application was not 
dismissed on merits rather this Court disposed of 
the 
same 
while 
observing 
that 
impugned 
proceedings have been initiated against the VC 
during the pendency of his CP before the Apex 
Court and he was advised to approach the said 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        19 
 
Court for redressal of his grievance. Civil Appeal 
filed by the petitioner before the Apex Court has 
already been allowed in his favour and presently 
no proceedings are pending in the said Court, as 
such the referred order of this Court stands 
nowhere in deciding of instant petition.  
17. 
So far as the argument of the learned Law 
Officer that cancellation report has already been 
submitted in the trial Court, therefore, the 
petitioners must approach to the said Court,  
suffice it to say that it is well settled by now that 
once the Court arrived at a conclusion that the 
impugned FIR was lodged against an accused for 
some 
ulterior 
motive 
and 
continuance 
of 
proceedings before the trial forum would be a 
futile exercise, wastage of precious public time and 
there is no likelihood of conviction of the 
petitioner in any eventuality,  it can quash the same  
notwithstanding the fact that even the challan has 
been submitted in the Court. Reliance is placed on 
cases reported as “ The State ..Vs.. Asif Ali Zardari 
and another (1994 SCMR 798), Miraj Khan ..Vs.. 
Gul Ahmed and 3 others (2000 SCMR 122),  
Maqbool Rehman ..Vs.. The State and others (2002 
SCMR 1076) and Muhammad Aslam (Amir Aslam) 
and 
others 
..Vs.. 
District 
Police 
Officer, 
Rawalpindi and others (2009 SCMR 141). In the 
latter case, where even the formal charge has been 
framed, the Hon’ble Apex Court has observed as 
under:- 
“ In the facts and circumstances of the case, 
we feel that continuation of the proceedings would 
be a futile exercise and wastage of time. In view of 
the material on file no offence has been made out 
and the charge on the face of it appears to be 
groundless and there is no possibility of conviction. 
In law, nothing warrants for the argument that since 
charge has been framed by the trial Court, the 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        20 
 
proceedings could not be buried by way of 
quashment. There is no invariable rule of law and it 
was dependent on the facts of each case whether to 
allow the proceedings to continue or to nip in the 
bud.” 
 
18. 
From the above discussion, it has been 
established on record that the entire proceedings 
against the petitioners were orchestrated by 
respondent No.5 with malafide intention and 
ulterior motive, whose eligibility to hold the office 
of Vice Chancellor being lower in merits, was 
challenged by the petitioner in this Court. 
Apparently, an attempt was made to coerce the VC 
to lay his hand off for contesting his legitimate 
right for the post of Vice Chancellor being on 
merit and unfortunately respondent No.6, being the 
convener of the Probe Committee extended full 
help to respondent No.5 for achieving his ulterior 
goals, while recording findings against the 
petitioners contrary to the record.  Due to their 
malafide act not only the petitioners were 
humiliated before the NAB, who closed the 
inquiry, but here in the ACE they faced the 
inquiries/investigations on the so called charges of 
their rivals continuously. The petitioners have been 
given clean chit by the ACE in two consecutive 
investigations and cancellation report has been 
prepared which was duly forwarded by the 
Prosecution Department, which means that there 
was no substance in the allegations against the 
petitioners but unfortunately, the Trial Court is 
sitting over it for the last more than eleven months. 
The petitioners cannot be made shuttle cock to run 
from one Court to the other merely on the ground 
of pendency of cancellation report. Referring them 
again to the Trial Court to pursue cancellation 

W.P. No.9024/2021  
 
 
                        21 
 
report would amount to continuation of the 
harassment caused by respondents No.5 & 6 by 
initiating the criminal proceedings against them.  
19. 
In view of above, instant writ petition is 
allowed as a consequence thereof impugned FIR 
No.41/2020, in respect of offence under Sections 
409,468,471 & 420 PPC read with Section 5(2) of 
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 registered at 
P.S. ACE, Region Faisalabad is quashed.
