Date of Hearing: 
02.10.2023 
Petitioners by: 
Barrister Syeda Maqsooma Zahra 
Bukhari, Advocate.  
Mr. Mubashar Hussain, Advocate.  
Ms. Iqra Liaqat, Advocate alongwith 
petitioners in person.  
Respondent No.2 by: 
Syed Qamar Ali Rizvi, Advocate.  
Mr. Wajahat Ali Niazi, Advocate.  
    Anwaar Hussain, J.  By way of factual background, it has been 
noted that the issue relates to the year 2010, when respondent No.2, 
namely, Abdul Rasool Qadri (“the respondent”) filed a guardian 
petition, under Section 25 of the Guardians & Wards Act, 1890 
(“the Act”) against petitioner No.1 who is the real mother of 
petitioner No.2 (“the minor”), for the custody of the latter, which 
was dismissed by the Guardian Court, after preparing a visitation 
schedule, vide order dated 26.01.2010. Thereafter, the petitioners 
challenged the aforesaid order of the Guardian Court to the extent of 
visitation schedule and the Appellate Court modified the same vide 
order dated 01.06.2010. The respondent, being dissatisfied with the 
said modification, filed constitutional petition bearing W.P 
No.13115/2010, which was decided by this Court on 29.06.2011 by 
allowing the respondent to meet the minor every Saturday for six 
hours from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM in the premises of the Guardian 
Court. Thereafter, on the application of the respondent, time of the 

2 
W.P. No.66966 of 2020 
 
 
meeting was extended and the venue of the meeting was also 
changed through the impugned judgment dated 21.11.2020. When 
the case was admitted for regular hearing by this Court on 
18.12.2020, it was the assertion of the petitioners that the impugned 
judgment is against welfare of the minor inasmuch as the age factor 
of the minor had been ignored, who had attained the age of 15-years, 
and being a female, it was inappropriate to spend a long time 
without the company of her mother at the premises of the respondent 
who is statedly a Peer/Imam and whose residence is mostly 
occupied by men and young boys.  
2. 
It is the case of the petitioners that the matter has become 
infructuous as by afflux of time, the minor has attained the age of 
majority and they are not bound by the visitation schedule chalked 
out by the Courts below let alone the schedule chalked out by the 
learned Appellate Court, through the impugned judgment, more 
particularly, when the respondent has never discharged his 
obligations as a father including payment of maintenance and was 
never keen in meeting the minor which is evident from the fact that 
after the case was earlier decided by this Court through order dated 
29.06.2011, in W.P. No.13115/2010, it took almost nine years for 
the respondent to realise that he needed to see the minor for 
extended period.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent submit that 
even if the minor has attained majority, it is the right of the 
respondent to meet the minor who is his real daughter and therefore, 
this Court should direct the minor to meet the respondent.  
4. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioners submit that 
once the minor has attained age of majority, this Court also lacks 
jurisdiction to pass any direction. The minor is also in attendance 

3 
W.P. No.66966 of 2020 
 
 
and has completely shown her disinclination to see the respondent 
and contends that she has been neglected by the respondent and has 
neither any bonding with the latter nor does she expect any love and 
affection or other benefit from the respondent.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
Issue of custody of the minor was decided by Courts below in 
favour of petitioner No.1 and the controversy was regarding the 
venue of the meeting of the respondent with the minor when the 
present petition was filed, however, since the minor has attained age 
of majority, therefore, the only question that requires opinion of this 
Court is to examine the effect of change in age of the minor during 
the pendency of a lis emanating from the guardian petition and 
whether in such an eventuality, this Court has jurisdiction to pass 
any direction compelling the minor to meet the respondent.  
7. 
Before answering the legal question, it will be in fitness of 
things to examine the object of the Act, which is a special 
enactment. The Act aims at ensuring that welfare of a minor is kept 
at forefront while deciding the guardian petition and chalking out the 
visitation schedule for which the jurisdiction vests with the Guardian 
Courts. Jurisdiction of the Court, in law, refers to authority vested 
with a Court to hear and adjudicate the cases according to the 
subject matter of the cases. One cannot lose sight of the fact that it is 
the Act that vests jurisdiction in the Guardian Court to ensure that a 
minor’s person and property is extended proper protection through 
appointment of a guardian since a minor is presumed to suffer from 
disability and is not in a position to appreciate his/her welfare. 
Therefore, through appointment of a guardian, the minor is brought 
to the protection of the Guardian Court which is obligated to 
exercise the jurisdiction vested with it to ensure continuity of the 

4 
W.P. No.66966 of 2020 
 
 
welfare of a minor. Once a guardian is appointed, such a minor is 
treated as a “Ward” in terms of Section 4(3) of the Act that reads as 
under:  
“ward” means a minor for whose person or property, or 
both there is a guardian;”  
8. 
In the instant case, jurisdiction, under the Act, was exercised 
by the Guardian Court, in the first instance and the custody of the 
minor was given to petitioner No.1 and thereafter, the venue of the 
meeting of the minor with the respondent was changed through the 
impugned judgment by the Appellate Court and the order of the 
Appellate Court was challenged before this Court through present 
petition. This jurisdiction exercised by the Trial Court as also the 
Appellate Court and the present proceedings are continuity of the lis. 
The aim is to review whether the welfare of the minor was 
considered at the time of deciding the guardian petition, chalking out 
and amending the visitation schedule including change of venue of 
the meeting of a minor with the non-custodial parent. Such 
protection of the minor and the jurisdiction of the Courts continues 
so long as the ward is under the legal disability (minority); however, 
the moment the said disability transforms into the legal capacity, on 
attaining the age of majority, the jurisdiction of the Guardian Court 
ceases to exist along with the power of the guardian so appointed by 
the Guardian Court. Section 41(1)(c) of the Act is amply clear in this 
regard, which for facility of reference is reproduced hereunder:  
“41. Cessation of authority of guardian.-- 
(1) 
The Powers of a guardian of the person 
cease— 
a) 
…….. 
b) 
…….. 
c) 
by the ward ceasing to be a 
minor;”  

5 
W.P. No.66966 of 2020 
 
 
9. 
The law in its wisdom envisages that once a minor attains the 
age of majority, he becomes sui juris, and it is believed that such 
person is well aware of the consequences of his/her acts and 
omissions. He/she is also vested with certain fundamental rights 
under the Constitution to decide what is in his/her best interest and 
cannot be compelled to meet someone against his/her wishes, even if 
such other person is his/her real father. Since on attaining the age of 
majority, the Guardian Court ceases to have any jurisdiction, 
therefore, the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court also comes to 
an end as power of this Court to issue a writ of certiorari is not an 
independent jurisdiction but supervisory in nature and is used to 
bring into the High Court, the decisions of subordinate Courts in 
order to investigate the same and if any jurisdictional defect or 
procedural impropriety is pointed out, the same are quashed.  
10. 
Therefore, the moment, at any stage of the proceedings in a 
guardian case, the minor attains the age of majority, the lis becomes 
infructuous as the Courts cease to have jurisdiction, under the Act 
and cannot pass any directions. As a natural corollary, any further 
proceedings by this Court would be coram-non-judice. However, 
this Court feels incumbent to observe that for a minor, like  Sameen 
Rasool, who has attained the age of majority and suffered due to the 
litigation between her parents in general and the purported 
neglecting attitude of the respondent in particular, it is natural to 
develop disinclination, if not hatred towards a non-custodial parent 
like the respondent but once grown up, it is expected that such a 
minor will exhibit wisdom and voluntarily show kindness towards 
her non-custodial parent, who is her real father, even if the 
respondent has been negligent, in the past, in respect of  discharge of 
his obligation(s), towards the minor, since such kindness to be 
exhibited, on part of the children towards their parents, is the 

6 
W.P. No.66966 of 2020 
 
 
command of Allah Almighty and the teachings of Prophet 
Muhammad, (S.A.W.), which every Muslim, including the minor, is 
obligated to follow. 
11. 
In the light of above discussion, this Court is of the opinion 
that the matter has become infructuous and this Court lacks 
jurisdiction to issue any direction compelling the erstwhile minor, 
namely, Sameen Rasool to meet the respondent.  
12. 
Disposed of in above terms.
