For the Appellant: 
Syed Fakhar Imam Bukhari, Advocate. 
For Respondent No.1:

Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Appellant claims that on 
30.5.2022, a vendor on Daraz, who called himself “Innocent Gamer” 
with Facebook ID Bandex.net, persuaded her to buy a VIVO V19  
cell phone online at a 20% discount. At 11:23 p.m., she remitted  
PKR 48,000/- for it to Daraz Wallet Account using Easypaisa 
(Transaction ID: 7648354737). The order was confirmed, and after 20 
minutes, she received an e-mail informing her that the cell phone had 
been delivered to her address, which was untrue. She didn’t get any. 
She realized it was a scam and immediately notified the Daraz 
Customer Care Department about it via e-mail. She also requested a 
return of the money she had deposited in the Daraz Wallet Account as 
aforesaid. The Customer Care Department sought various details from 
the Appellant over the next ten days, pretending to resolve the matter, 
but on 11.6.2020, denied the company’s liability and asked her to 
approach the Federal Investigation Agency under the Prevention of 
Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (PECA) for redress. The Appellant served 
Daraz with a statutory notice under the Punjab Consumer Protection

Act, 2005 (the “Punjab Act”), demanding Rs. 2.00 million in 
compensation and Rs.27,000/- in legal fees for faulty service. On 
4.7.2020, she filed a claim under section 25 of the Act with the District 
Consumer Court, Multan, which the Presiding Officer rejected under 
Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”) by 
order dated 7.4.2022 (the “Impugned Order”). Hence, this appeal. 
2. 
 
The office objected that a criminal appeal against the 
Impugned Order is not competent. This Court ordered that it would 
consider that objection on the judicial side and, subject to the question 
of maintainability, issued notice to the Respondents. Respondent  
No.2 (Innocent Gamer) could not be served due to non-availability of 
address. 
3. 
 
The Appellant’s counsel, Syed Fakhar Imam Bukhari, 
Advocate, insists that this criminal appeal is maintainable under section 
33 of the Punjab Act and that the office objection is misconceived. On 
merits, he contends that Daraz, through its website and media 
campaign, offers simple and secure online shopping, safe and fast 
payments, money and order tracking, and hassle-free returns and 
refunds. However, it did not happen in the present case. The Appellant 
has suffered a loss due to Daraz’s poor service and unfriendly customer 
policies. Mr Bukhari further contends that the Appellant’s complaint 
before the Consumer Court was competent, and the judge has 
misapplied the provisions of Order VII Rule 11 CPC to reject it. 
4. 
 
The counsel for Daraz, Mr Sikandar Abbas, Advocate, has 
supported the office objection and defended the Impugned Order. He 
submits that the Appellant’s complaint does not disclose a cause of 
action against Daraz, and the Consumer Court rightly rejected it. She 
was duped by a phoney Facebook Page, Bandex.net, for ordering a cell 
phone. Her money went into a bogus account created by the swindler. 
Although that account was styled as Daraz Wallet Account, Daraz did 
not own it and never received any money from the Appellant. Daraz 
has not committed any negligence and is, therefore, not liable to 
compensate her for the loss. The Appellant is a victim of cybercrime 
and should seek redress under PECA.

Opinion 
5. 
 
The United Nations General Assembly, by Resolution 
39/248 of 16 April 1985, adopted the U.N. Guidelines for Consumer 
Protection which stated: 
“Taking into account the interests and needs of consumers in all 
countries, particularly those in developing countries, recognizing 
that consumers often face imbalances in economic terms, 
educational level, and bargaining power, and bearing in mind that 
consumer should have the right of access to non-hazardous products, 
as well as the importance of promoting just, equitable and 
sustainable economic and social development, these guidelines for 
consumer protection have the following objectives: 
(a) 
To assist countries in achieving or maintaining 
adequate 
protection 
for 
their 
population 
as 
consumers; 
(b) 
To facilitate production and distribution patterns 
responsible for the needs and desires of consumers; 
(c) 
To encourage high levels of ethical conduct for those 
engaged in the production and distribution of goods 
and services to consumers; 
(d) 
To assist countries in curbing abusive business 
practices by all enterprises at the national and 
international 
levels 
which 
adversely 
affect 
consumers; 
(e) 
To facilitate the development of independent 
consumer groups; 
(f) 
To further international cooperation in the field of 
consumer protection; 
(g) 
To encourage the development of market conditions 
which provide consumers with greater choice at 
lower prices.” 
6. 
 
The Economic and Social Council expanded the 1985 
Guidelines in Resolution 1999/7 on 26 July 1999, which the General 
Assembly revised and adopted in Resolution 70/186 of 22 December 
2015. These Guidelines are valuable principles outlining the key 
features of effective consumer protection legislation, enforcement 
institutions and redress mechanisms. They help interested Member 
States develop and enforce domestic and regional laws, rules and 
regulations suitable to their economic, social and environmental 
conditions. They also foster international enforcement cooperation 
among Member States and stimulate the exchange of experiences in 
consumer protection.1

The Punjab Act is a special law inspired by the above-
mentioned U.N. Guidelines.2 Section 3 thereof stipulates that its 
provisions are in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for 
the time being in force. Part II of the Act addresses liability for 
defective products, while Part III discusses liability for defective and 
faulty services. Part IV details the obligations of manufacturers. Part V 
prohibits unfair practices. Part VI to VIII set out the procedure for 
punishing offences under the Act and disposal of claims. Part IX 
contains some miscellaneous provisions. 
8. 
 
The Punjab Act creates two forums for dealing with 
matters it covers. Section 23(1) states that any person may file a 
complaint for violation of sections 11, 16, 18 and 19 before the 
Authority which may fine the offender up to Rs.50,000/- if the 
allegation is proven. Section 2(b) defines “Authority” as the District 
Coordination Officer of the relevant district or such other officer as the 
Government may notify. Section 23(2) stipulates that the Authority 
may file a claim before the Consumer Court for declaring a product 
defective under sections 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 or a service as faulty or defective 
under section 13. Section 23(3) states that the Authority may approach 
the Consumer Court for declaring an action of any person as being in 
contravention of Part IV of the Act. Section 23(4) says that the 
Authority may, on receipt of a complaint or reference from the 
Consumer Protection Council or on its own motion, hold an inquiry as 
to the defects in products, services or practices which contravene any of 
the provisions of the Act. Section 23(7) provides that any person 
aggrieved by the Authority’s order under section 23(1) may appeal to 
the Government within 30 days. 
9. 
 
The second forum is the Consumer Court established 
under section 26 of the Punjab Act, which adjudicates claims for 
damages arising out of contravention of any provisions of the Act  
(see section 25) following the procedure outlined in section 30. If it 
                                          
2 The preamble of the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 reads: 
“Whereas it is expedient to provide for protection and promotion of the rights and interests 
of the consumers, speedy redress of consumer complaints and for matters connected 
therewith.”

determines that the products complained about have any of the defects 
mentioned in the claim, or that any or all of the allegations contained in 
the claim against the services are true, it shall direct the defendant to 
take one or more of the actions listed in section 31 of the Act. 
10. 
 
It is noteworthy that sections 16 and 18 appear in both 
sections 23(1) and 32(1). The effect of this duplication will be 
examined in an appropriate case. 
11. 
 
The first question that requires determination is as to what 
is the nature of proceedings under the Punjab Act. 
12. 
 
There are two broad categories of law: criminal law and 
civil law. In the most general sense, criminal law aims to punish, while 
the civil law is meant to compensate. As a result, they have different 
procedural rules, including those relating to evidence. This paradigm 
shapes legal principles and the division of authority among courts.3 
13. 
 
Historically, there have been different emphases in 
defining the purposes of criminal law, which gave rise to the theories of 
retribution, deterrence, prevention and reformation. However, modern 
legal theorists posit that criminal and civil law serve the same function 
of societal control. According to Kenneth Mann,4 punitive civil 
sanctions are rapidly expanding, affecting a growing segment of society 
in cases brought by private parties and the government. These sanctions 
are sometimes more severe than the corresponding criminal penalties 
for the same conduct. Punitive civil sanctions are replacing a significant 
part of criminal law in crucial areas of law enforcement, particularly in 
white-collar prosecutions, for two reasons: first, they carry tremendous 
punitive power, and second, they are more efficient than criminal 
penalties because the criminal procedure does not constrain them. 
Consequently, the jurisprudence of sanctions is undergoing a radical 
change. As more punishment is handed down in civil proceedings, the 
features distinguishing civil from criminal law become less clear. 
Almost every attribute associated with one paradigm appears in the 
                                          
3 Kenneth Mann, Punitive Civil Sanctions: The Middleground Between Criminal and Civil Law,  
The Yale Law Journal, June 1992, Vol. 101, No.8, Symposium: Punishment (Jun., 1992), pp. 1795-
1875.  https: //www.jstor.org/stable/796948

other. Imprisonment, which is linked with the criminal process, also 
exists in the civil realm. For example, civil contempt is punishable by 
incarceration. Payment of money, distinctively associated with civil 
law, takes the form of fines in criminal law. Mann further states: 
“I use the term ‘middleground’ to describe the jurisprudential arena 
of punitive civil sanctions. The middleground draws on the two 
basic paradigms that form the doctrinal basis for the entire field of 
sanctioning law: criminal law and civil law. The paradigms of 
criminal and civil law stem from longstanding conventions about the 
essential nature and function of legal sanctions. Within this 
paradigmatic framework, the criminal law is distinguished by its 
punitive purposes, its high procedural barriers to conviction, its 
concern with the blameworthiness of the defendant, and its 
particularly harsh sanctions. In contrast, the civil law is defined as a 
compensatory scheme, focusing on damage rather than on 
blameworthiness, and providing less severe sanctions and lower 
procedural safeguards than the criminal law. The middleground 
draws on these two basic paradigms to form a hybrid jurisprudence 
in which the sanction’s purpose is punishment, but its procedure is 
drawn primarily from the civil law.” 
14. 
 
Legislatures today also give administrative bodies the 
authority to punish offenders in civil proceedings. In the United States, 
Mann writes, when the Supreme Court upheld the administrative 
procedure for assessing penalties, it left Congress free to expand the 
powers of administrative agencies and grant them additional power to 
impose penalties. In response to the reports that the government failed 
to prosecute many medicare and medicaid fraud cases, Congress 
empowered the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human 
Services to levy a civil money penalty of up to $ 2000 for each 
fraudulent claim plus twice the amount claimed. Congress has 
increased the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission to 
seek punitive sentences. It has also expanded civil penalties in the False 
Claims Act and several other laws. 
15. 
 
Notwithstanding the above developments, the distinction 
between civil and criminal penalties is of constitutional importance. 
The U.S. Supreme Court noted this fact in United States v. Ward,  
48 U.S. 242 (1980), and pointed out that the Self-incrimination Clause 
of the Fifth Amendment, for example, is expressly limited to  
“any criminal case”. Similarly, the Sixth Amendment safeguards are 
only available in criminal prosecutions. The Double Jeopardy Clause 
protects only against criminal punishment, and proof beyond a

reasonable doubt is required only in criminal cases. The Supreme Court 
went on to say that whether a particular statutorily defined penalty is 
civil or criminal is a matter of statutory interpretation. Traditionally, the 
inquiry in this regard has proceeded on two levels. First, the court has 
to determine whether Congress expressed or implied a preference for 
one label or the other when establishing the penalizing mechanism. 
Second, whether Congress has indicated an intention to enact a civil 
penalty. If so, the court must then inquire whether the statutory scheme 
was so punitive in purpose or effect to negate that intention. The 
Supreme Court said that the factors listed in Kennedy v. Mendoza-
Martinez, 372 U.S. 144 (1963), which are neither exhaustive nor 
dispositive, help determine whether an Act of Congress is penal or 
regulatory. They are as follows: 
“Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, 
whether it has historically been recorded as a punishment, whether it 
comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation 
will promote the traditional aims of punishment, retribution and 
deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a 
crime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be 
connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in 
relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the 
inquiry, and may often point in differing directions. Absent 
conclusive evidence of Congressional intent as to the penal nature of 
a statute, these factors must be considered in relation to the statute 
on its face.” 
16. 
 
The Punjab Act follows the modern legislative trend 
discussed above. It provides a remedy before the Authority, an 
administrative body, in some matters and before the Consumer Court in 
others. 
17. 
 
The Punjab Act’s provisions are predominantly civil in 
nature,5 but sections 23(1) and 32 require in-depth analysis. Section 
23(1) empowers the Authority to impose fines for certain infractions of 
the Act. Section 32(1) states that when a manufacturer violates sections 
4 to 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18 to 22, he shall be punished with imprisonment 
up to two years or with a fine up to a hundred thousand rupees or with 
both, in addition to damages or compensation as may be determined by 
the Consumer Court. Thus, it creates statutory offences. Section 30(2) 
states that where a defendant or a claimant fails or omits to comply 
                                          
5 especially sections 27, 28, 30 and 31.

with the Consumer Court’s order, he would be punished with 
imprisonment and a fine. Applying the principles laid down in 
Kennedy’s case, in my opinion, sections 23(1) and 32(2) of the Punjab 
Act establish civil penalties. 
18. 
 
Section 32(2) of the Punjab Act is analogous to section 27 
of India’s repealed Consumer Protection Act of 1986 and section 72 of 
the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 presently in force. In State of 
Karnataka v. Vishwabharathi House Building Coop. Society and 
others (AIR 2003 SC 1043), while considering section 27 of the 1986 
Act,6 the Indian Supreme Court held that it is an additional power for 
the execution of orders. The relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
“58. 
Furthermore, section 27 of the Act also confers an additional 
power upon the Forum and the Commission to execute its order. 
The said provision is akin to Order 39 Rule 2-A of the Civil 
Procedure Code or the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act or 
section 51 read with Order 21 Rule 37 of the Civil Procedure Code. 
Section 25 should be read in conjunction with section 27. A 
Parliamentary statute indisputably can create a tribunal and might 
say that non-compliance with its order would be punishable by way 
of imprisonment or fine, which can be in addition to any other mode 
of recovery. 
59. 
It is well settled that the cardinal principle of interpretation 
of statute is that courts or tribunals must be held to possess the 
power to execute their own order.  
60. 
It is also well settled that a statutory tribunal which has been 
conferred with the power to adjudicate a dispute and pass necessary 
order has also the power to implement its order. Further, the Act 
which is a self-contained Code, even if it has not been specifically 
spelt out, must be deemed to have conferred upon the tribunal all 
powers in order to make its order effective.” 
19. 
 
The 
Allahabad 
High 
Court 
ruled 
in 
Ghaziabad 
Development Authority v. Union of India (UoI) and another,  
2003 (4) AWC 3078 b), that the proceedings under section 27 of 
India’s Consumer Protection Act of 1986 are akin to civil contempt. It 
stated: 
                                          
6 Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act of 1986 stated: 
27. 
Penalties.– Where a trader or a person against whom a complaint is made  
(or the complainant) fails or omits to comply with any order made by the District Forum, 
the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, such trader or 
person (or complainant) shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not 
be less than one month but, which may extend to three years, or with fine which shall not 
be less than two thousand rupees but which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with 
both: 
Provided that … 

Crl. Appeal No.559/2023

“A perusal of section 27 clearly shows that the proceedings therein 
are in the nature of proceedings for contempt, and their object is to 
compel obedience of the orders of the District Forum, State 
Commission or the National Commission … The proceedings under 
section 27 are really not ordinary criminal proceedings in respect of 
offences under [the Indian Penal Code] or some other statute. The  
… only procedure required in these proceedings is that the 
principles of natural justice should be complied with … It appears 
that Parliament has specifically enacted section 27 to give teeth to 
the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act. Had there been no 
provision for enforcement of the orders of the authorities under the 
Act, the entire purpose of the Statute would have been frustrated as 
nobody would obey the orders of these authorities. Without the 
sanction of section 27, the entire consumer jurisdiction would only 
be a paper tiger lacking teeth.” 
20. 
 
In view of the above, it is reasonable to conclude that 
section 32(2) of the Punjab Act does not stricto sensu constitute a 
statutory offence but serves as a tool for the execution of the Consumer 
Court’s orders. 
Proceedings before the Consumer Court 
21. 
 
A Consumer Court established under the Punjab Act is a 
special court with both civil and criminal jurisdictions.  However, it is 
not a civil court in the sense of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908  
because a petition, claim or complaint brought before it is not treated as 
a suit or plaint, and it does not pass a decree. Similarly, it cannot be 
termed a pure criminal court because of its limited criminal provisions. 
This indicates the uniqueness of the Consumer Court and its 
proceedings. For this reason, the Legislature thought it necessary to 
enact section 30(4) to clarify that every proceeding before the 
Consumer Court shall be deemed a judicial proceeding. In the normal 
course, such deeming provisions are not required because pure civil and 
criminal processes are always judicial in nature. 
22. 
 
The draftsman has interchangeably used the terms “claim” 
and “complaint” throughout the Punjab Act without considering that 
they have different legal meanings. It is, however, important to point 
out that he has not used them in the sense contemplated by the Code of 
Criminal Procedure 1898. This view finds support by the fact that Part 
VIII of the Punjab Act, which deals with proceedings before the 
Consumer Court, is titled “Disposal of Claims and Establishment of 
Consumer Courts.” This Part begins with section 25 and is also 

Crl. Appeal No.559/2023 
 
- 10 -
captioned as “filing of claims.” Furthermore, sections 25 to 31 deal 
with the civil rather than a criminal remedy. 
Application of CPC in proceedings before the Consumer Court 
23. 
 
There is no provision in the Punjab Act which says that 
CPC would apply to the cases before the Consumer Court. Nonetheless, 
section 30(3) of the Act, reproduced below, states: 
(3) 
For the purposes of this section, the Consumer Court shall 
have the same powers as are vested in civil court under the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act XX of 1908), while trying a suit, in 
respect of the following matters, namely: 
(a) 
the summoning and enforcing attendance of any 
defendant or witness and examining him on oath; 
(b) 
the discovery and production of any document or 
other material object which may be produced as 
evidence;  
(c) 
the receiving of evidence on affidavits;  
(d) 
issuing of any commission for the examination of any 
witness; and  
(e) 
any other matter which may be prescribed. 
24. 
 
Since section 30(3) of the Punjab Act grants the Consumer 
Court some specific powers that civil courts have under the CPC, the 
remainder are excluded by necessary implication. The following Latin 
legal maxims lend support to this interpretation: (i) Expressio unius est 
exclusio alterius (the express mention of one thing is the exclusion of 
the other) and (ii) Expressum facit cessare tacitum (what is expressed 
makes what is implied silent). In Union of India and another v. 
Shardindu, (2007) 6 SCC 276, the Indian Supreme Court held that 
when the provision’s language is plain and unambiguous, the question 
of supplying casus omissus does not arise. The court can interpret a law 
but cannot legislate. In Reference No.01 of 2012 (PLD 2013 SC 279),7 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan held: 
“A casus omissus can, in no case, be supplied by the court of law as 
that would amount to altering the provision. ‘It is not our function, 
as was held by Mr. Justice Walsh, in the case of Attorney General v. 
Bihari, re Australia Factors Limited (1966) 67 S.R. (N.S.W.) 150, to 
repair the blunders that are to be found in the legislation. They must 
be corrected by the legislator’. A court of law is not entitled to read 
words into the Constitution or an Act of Parliament unless clear 
reason is found within the four corners of either of them.”

In India, section 13(4) of the repealed Consumer 
Protection Act of 1986 and section 38(9) of the Consumer Protection 
Act of 2019 currently in force provide for a limited application of the 
Indian Code of Civil Procedure, similar to section 30(3) of the Punjab 
Act. The Supreme Court considered section 13(4) supra in New India 
Assurance Company Ltd. v. Srinivasan (AIR 2000 SC 941) and ruled: 
“10. 
We have already indicated above that the Code of Civil 
Procedure has been applied to the proceedings under the Consumer 
Protection Act only to a limited extent. If the intention of the 
Legislature was to apply the provisions of Order 9 also to the 
proceedings under the Consumer Protection Act, it would have 
clearly provided in the Act that the provisions of Order 9 would also 
be applicable to the proceedings before the District Forum or the 
State Commission or, for that matter, before the National 
Commission. If the Legislature itself did not apply the rule of 
prohibition contained in Order 9 Rule 9(1), it will be difficult for the 
Courts to extend that provision to the proceedings under the Act.” 
26. 
 
Reference may also be made to Ethiopian Airlines v. 
Ganesh Narain Saboo (AIR 2011 SC 3495) wherein the Supreme 
Court of India observed: 
“58. 
However, notwithstanding the fact that proceedings of the 
National Commission are ‘suits’ under the Carriers Act, vide the 
expressio unius principle, the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 
clearly enumerates those provisions of the CPC that are applicable 
to proceedings before the consumer fora. Such provisions include 
13(4), in which the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 vests those 
powers vested in a civil court under the CPC to the District Forum. 
However, according to the principle of expressio unius, because the 
Legislature expressly made the aforementioned provisions of the 
CPC applicable to the consumer proceedings, the Legislature is, 
therefore, deemed to have intentionally excluded all other provisions 
of the CPC from applying to the said proceedings. This is 
particularly true since, as explained above, the Consumer Protection 
Act, 1986 sets forth an exhaustive list of procedures, distinguishable 
from those required under the CPC, that the consumer redressal fora 
must follow. Therefore, since the Consumer Protection Act does not 
state that section 86 applies to the consumer fora’s proceedings, that 
Section of the CPC should be held to be not applicable.” 
27. 
 
I am inclined to adopt the above interpretation for the 
purposes of the Punjab Act for an additional reason that its object is to 
settle consumer complaints as expeditiously as possible. The 
application of CPC can delay the disposal of such complaints because 
technicalities complicate the trial. 
28. 
 
The law in our country is well recognized that unless there 
is a specific provision to the contrary in any special or local law, the 
ordinary rules of procedure apply. In Bambino Ltd. v. Selmor 

Crl. Appeal No.559/2023 
 
- 12 -
International Ltd. and another (PLD 1983 SC 155), the petitioners 
filed an ejectment petition against respondent No.1, the tenant of Room 
No. 27 of their building, in which the Rent Controller passed an ex 
parte eviction order. Following that, they moved an execution 
application in which the notice was served through publication in a 
newspaper. They also obtained an order of police aid. However, before 
the eviction order could be executed, the petitioners took possession of 
the room. They entered into a lease agreement with respondent No. 2, 
admitted him as a tenant, and began collecting rent. They did all of this 
without withdrawing the aforementioned execution application. When 
respondent No. 2 came to know that the ejectment order issued by the 
Rent Controller would be executed against him, he obtained a stay 
order from him, but by the time the court official could serve it, the 
process of eviction had already been completed. Nonetheless, he 
applied under section 151, read with section 141 CPC, for restitution of 
possession of the property. The Supreme Court of Pakistan held that 
under section 22 of the Sind Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979, an 
order passed by the Rent Controller or the appellate authority has to be 
executed in the manner determined by them. Consequently, the Rent 
Controller was competent to adopt any procedure he deemed suitable 
for the execution of his order. Order XXI Rules 100 and 101 CPC 
amply empower an Executing Court to investigate and adjudicate on 
the issue of dispossession from immovable property by the holder of a 
decree for possession of such property of a person other than the 
judgment-debtor. If the court is satisfied after such investigation that 
the applicant was in possession of the property on his own account or 
on behalf of some one other than the judgment-debtor, the Executing 
Court has the jurisdiction to direct that the applicant be put into 
possession of the property. It is a procedural rule based on equitable 
principles and the canon that a decree passed by the court ordinarily 
binds the parties to the suit, their assignees and anyone claiming 
through them.

In Mian Hakim Ullah and others v. Additional District 
Judge/Tribunal, Nowshera, and others (1993 SCMR 907), the 
appellant challenged the SDO’s notices issued under section 3(1) of the 

Crl. Appeal No.559/2023 
 
- 13 -
North-West Frontier Province Removal of Encroachments Act 1997 
before the tribunal established under section 12 of that Act. During the 
hearing of the appeal before the Supreme Court, the Advocate General 
contended that the rules framed under the Act merely provide for a 
referral to the tribunal and do not prescribe any procedure for filing a 
suit. Hence, it could not be brought before the tribunal directly. The 
Supreme Court ruled that the failure of the Government to make the 
necessary rules cannot render the Act inoperative and the tribunal 
dysfunctional. It observed that section 14(3) of the Act grants the 
tribunal the power of a civil court in matters such as summoning and 
enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him under oath, 
receiving evidence on affidavit, compelling production of documents 
and issuing commissions for examinations of witnesses or documents. 
Hence, the tribunal’s proceedings have all the necessary attributes of 
the proceedings of the civil court. The Supreme Court further stated 
that if the existing rules do not provide for a particular procedural 
matter relating to the proceedings before the tribunal, it is free to follow 
the principles contained in the CPC to the extent it deems essential.

In Haji Khudai Nazar and another v. Haji Abdul Bari 
(1997 SCMR 1986), the petitioners filed an application under Order 
XLI Rule 17 CPC in the High Court for recalling an ex parte judgment 
in a rent case, stating that their counsel reached the rostrum when it was 
being dictated and had not yet been signed. Further, the delay in getting 
to the Court was due to factors beyond his control. Before the Supreme 
Court, the question was whether CPC applied to the proceedings before 
the Rent Controller under the West Pakistan Urban Rent Restriction 
Ordinance, 1959, because it does not expressly exclude it. The Supreme 
Court ruled that CPC does not apply to such proceedings unless 
specifically made applicable by the rent laws. However, its principles 
may be applied in the facts and circumstances of the case so long as 
they do not conflict with the rent laws and advance the cause of justice. 
It further stated: 
“It is now well-settled that in proceedings before Court or Tribunal 
of quasi-judicial nature, even if there is no provision for setting 
aside an ex parte order, the Court/Tribunal would be empowered to 
exercise such power by applying principles of natural justice. Such 

Crl. Appeal No.559/2023 
 
- 14 -
provisions which enshrine principles of natural justice have to be 
read in the statute which do not specifically debar such a remedy. 
Therefore, even without applying the provisions of CPC in terms, 
the procedure provided under Order IX Rules 9 and 13 and Order 
XLI Rule 17 CPC can be applied by the Controller or the High 
Court in rent proceedings.” 
31. 
 
In Muhammad Tariq Khan v. Khawaja Muhammad 
Jawad Asami and others (2007 SCMR 818), the petitioner had taken 
possession of the property in terms of the order of the Rent Controller. 
The respondents filed a petition before him against the petitioner under 
Order XXI Rules 100, 101 and 103 CPC on the ground that the 
property was allotted to their predecessor. The Supreme Court ruled 
that the provisions of CPC are not stricto sensu applicable to the rent 
proceedings, but the Rent Controller may follow the equitable 
principles thereof.8 It further stated that section 144 CPC contains an 
equitable principle which can be invoked in ejectment cases.  
32. 
 
To sum up, the Code of Civil Procedure applies to the 
proceedings before the Consumer Court to the extent specified in 
section 30(3) of the Punjab Act. Nevertheless, it may also adopt its 
general principles insofar as they advance the interests of justice. 
Procedure for trial of offences 
33. 
 
The Punjab Act does not specify the procedure the 
Consumer Court would follow to try the offences. However, section 5 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, reproduced below, can be 
helpful in this regard: 
5. Trial of offences under Penal Code.– (1) All offences under the 
Pakistan Penal Code  shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and 
otherwise dealt with according to the provisions hereinafter 
contained. 
(2) 
Trial of offences against other laws.– All offences under 
any other law shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and 
otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions, but subject to 
any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or 
place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing 
with such offences. 
                                          
8 In this regard the Supreme Court referred to Ayub Khan and another v. Fazal Haq and others 
(PLD 1976 SC 422) and Bambino Ltd. v. Selmor International Ltd. and another 
(PLD 1983 SC 155). 

Crl. Appeal No.559/2023

Appeal to the High Court 
34. 
 
As discussed above, the proceedings before a Consumer 
Court may be civil or criminal. The said proceedings determine the 
nature of an appeal against a decision. If the proceeding is based on 
section 32(1) of the Punjab Act, the nature of the appeal will be 
criminal, while in the rest of the cases, it will be civil. 
The case at hand 
35. 
 
Section 33 of the Punjab Act provides that any person 
aggrieved by any final order of the Consumer Court may prefer an 
appeal in the Lahore High Court within 30 days. In the present case, the 
Appellant filed a claim for damages with the Consumer Court for an 
alleged faulty service of Daraz. The provisions of CPC do not strictly 
govern the proceedings before a Consumer Court. It can apply only its 
equitable principles. Thus, Order VII Rule 11 CPC is not applicable in 
terms, but the Consumer Court has the authority to decide on the 
maintainability of a claim. Since the Consumer Court has passed the 
Impugned Order of 07.04.2022 in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction, 
no criminal appeal is competent against it. As a result, the office 
objection is upheld. 
36. 
 
Inasmuch as the decision of this case turns on the question 
of maintainability, I need not discuss its merits. Appeal dismissed.
