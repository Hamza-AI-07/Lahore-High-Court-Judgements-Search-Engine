3. 
Heard. Record perused. 
4. 
Muhammad Shoaib Khan was done to death whereas 
Mureed Hussain Shah sustained firearm injuries (died on 
07.06.2019) during the occurrence took place on the road in 
front of the shop of Khyber Shoes on 29.05.2019 at 8:55 p.m. 
whereafter FIR was lodged on the same night at 10:30 p.m. on 
the statement of Ghulam Farooq KhanPW-10 (brother of Muhammad 
Shoaib Khan (deceased)), who while claiming himself to be the 
eyewitness of the occurrence stated in his statement before the 
trial Court as under:- 
 
“Stated that on 29.05.2019, on my oral statement 
Exh.P-D, FIR No.246/2019 (Exh.P-E) for the offence U/S 
302/324/34 was registered in police station City 
Mianwali wherein it was alleged that on 29.05.2019 at 
07:50 p.m. I alongwith my brother Ghulam Rasool on one 
motorcycle while Ikram Ullah Khan son of Muhammad 
Afzal Khan my Mamoozad/my co-villager alongwith 
Shoaib Khan while mounting on other motorcycle came to 
Mianwali city for shopping of Eid festival. At 08:55 p.m. 
we reached at Khayber Shoes Shop, located at Katchery 
road Mianwali City. When Muhammad Shoaib Khan, my 
brother was proceeding towards the shop, meanwhile 
accused persons present before the court namely Huzaifa 
Uman armed with 30-bore pistol, Sher Azam Khan armed 
with30-bore pistol, Zar Bad Shah armed with 30-bore 
pistol alongwith their co-accused Shakeel Khan (since 
being separately tried as juvenile) armed with 30-bore 
pistol who were identified by us in the lightening of shops 

3 
Criminal Appeal No.12779 of 2023 
Criminal PSLA No.19569 of 2023 
 
 
and bazar, came there on motorcycles and co-accused 
Shakeel Khan (since being separately tried as juvenile) 
challenged Muhammad Shoaib Khan by raising lalkara to 
be 
brave 
as 
they 
had 
come 
to 
avenge 
their 
insult/dishonor. In our presence, co-accused Shakeel 
Khan (since being separately tried as juvenile) and 
present accused Huzaifa Uman fired with their respective 
pistols upon Muhammad Shoaib Khan which landed on 
his head. Thereafter Sher Azam Khan accused present in 
the court made fire shots with his pistol at Muhammad 
Shoaib which hit on his left elbow and thigh. Zar bad 
Shah, accused present in the court made fire shots with 
pistol at Muhammad Shoaib Khan hitting the later at left 
calf and ankle. Muhammad Shoaib Khan fell to the 
ground being seriously injured. Thereafter, Huzaifa 
Uman, accused present in the court made a fire shot that 
hit on left side of the belly of Mureed Hussain Shah 
(deceased). Humza Shah son of Mureed Hussain Shah 
took care of Mureed Hussain Shah. All the aforesaid 
accused, while firing with their respective weapons, 
decamped 
towards 
north 
while 
riding 
on 
their 
motorcycles. The occurrence was witnessed by me and my 
aforesaid companions besides aforesaid Humza Shah. 
 
Motive behind the occurrence is that a few days 
earlier an altercation/exchange of hot words took place 
between Muhammad Shoaib Khan and Shakeel Khan etc. 
and due to said grudge, aforesaid accused with common 
intention and consultation, had injured Muhammad 
Shoaib Khan and Mureed Hussain Shah with intention to 
kill them. After arranging conveyance, Muhammad Shoaib 
Khan and Mureed Hussain Shah were brought to DHQ 
Hospital, Mianwali. Muhammad Shoaib Khan on reaching 
the hospital breathed his last. The accused had killed 
Muhammad Shoaib Khan and injured Mureed Hussain 
Shah and thus, committed serious offence. I am 
complainant against the accused persons and they be 
proceeded against. Exh.P-D was read over to me and I 
signed the same.” 
5. 
Hamza ShahPW-11 (son of Mureed Hussain Shah (deceased)) and 
Ikram Ullah KhanPW-12 (cousin "زاد "امومں of Muhammad Shoaib Khan 
(deceased)) while appearing before the trial Court have reiterated 
the same story. 
6. 
All the eyewitnesses have given photographic narration of 
the incident by attributing each injury of each deceased to each 
of the accused but Hamza ShahPW-11 (eyewitness) has not 
disclosed seat of injuries of Muhammad Shoaib Khan (deceased) 
attributed to Zar Badshah (co-accused). Ghulam Farooq KhanPW-10 
and Ikram Ullah KhanPW-12 stated in their statements before the 
trial Court that fire shots made by Zar Badshah (co-accused)  

4 
Criminal Appeal No.12779 of 2023 
Criminal PSLA No.19569 of 2023 
 
 
hit on left calf and ankle of Muhammad Shoaib Khan (deceased). 
Contrary to this, medical officer Dr. Uzair Hashim NiaziPW-8 
during his post-mortem examination did not observe any injury 
on his left calf 
(ڈنپیل)
 and ankle specifically attributed to Zar 
Badshah (co-accused), rather observed grazing wound over the 
dorsum of left foot which has not specifically been attributed to 
him. This conflict between ocular and medical evidence is not 
ignorable, rather shatters the credibility of the eyewitnesses 
creating doubt regarding their presence at relevant time at the 
place of occurrence. 2020 SCMR 192 “Sufyan Nawaz and 
another Vs. the State and others”. 
7. 
Zar Badshah (co-accused) has been found not involved in 
the occurrence during investigation as stated by Ameer Ahmed 
Khan, SI/SHOCW-1. In these circumstances, involvement of 
Zar Badshah (co-accused) in this case is not only free from 
doubt but also sufficient to discard whole story of the 
prosecution. 2019 SCMR 1978 “Safdar Mehmood and 
others Vs. Tanvir Hussain and others”. 
8. 
Zar Badshah (co-accused) has been attributed effective role 
of firing on the person of Muhammad Shoaib Khan (deceased) 
but he has been acquitted by the trial Court by discarding the 
evidence of the eyewitnesses, same evidence is not believable 
to the extent of the appellants in absence of independent 
corroborative piece of evidence which is conspicuously 
missing in the present case. 2016 SCMR 1763 “Shahbaz 
Vs. The State”. 
9. 
It is mentioned in the FIR that after the occurrence, 
Mureed Hussain Shah (deceased) in injured condition and dead 
body of Muhammad Shoaib Khan (deceased) were shifted to 
hospital. Shahid Nisar Akbar, InspectorCW-2 admitted in cross-
examination that he had not interrogated about any vehicle or 
vehicle of Rescue 1122 through which the injured and 
deceased were shifted from the place of occurrence.

Criminal PSLA No.19569 of 2023 
 
 
10. Zafar Khan (Emergency Medical Technician/Official of Rescue 1122) 
while appearing before the trial Court as DW-2 stated in his 
statement that on 29.05.2019, he was working at District 
Headquarter Rescue Service 1122, Mianwali as Emergency 
Medical Technician, on the same day he reached at Katchehri 
Road, Mianwali City in response to an emergency call about 
Mureed Hussain s/o Mushtaq Hussain aged about 50 years 
r/o Balo Khel Road Mianwali (now deceased) where he came to 
know that above said Mureed Hussain had sustained firearm 
injuries at the hands of unknown persons while purchasing 
shoes from a shop; he and Bilal, Emergency Medical 
Technician (not DW) provided him first aid and shifted him to 
DHQ Hospital, Mianwali through emergency vehicle No.MN-02 
driven by Iqbal Driver of Rescue Office. Original record of 
Emergency Response Form No.60654, COD No.199374 is 
before him which is in his handwriting. Exh. DK is copy of 
1122 Emergency Response Form. The trial Court has observed 
that “original record perused and returned” which was brought 
by Muhammad Rizwan (Official of Rescue Service Office) and 
produced it before the trial Court while appearing as DW-1. 
Copy of Emergency Call Form No.60654 at Serial No.83685. 
Exh. DJ was also obtained in the statement of Muhammad 
RizwanDW-1, perusal of which shows that one person namely 
Sami through cell phone i.e. 0301-3953415 had informed 
Rescue Office on 29.05.2019 at 20:55 (8:55 p.m.) regarding the 
present incident, it is also mentioned in Urdu as under:- 
"2 
"ومٹک ےھت۔ اکی وک وپسیل وایل ونی رکیل یلچ یئگ یھت وج وفت وہایگ اھت۔ ہی ومٹک راہ ریگ اھت۔ 
Exh. DK is Emergency Response Form, perusal of which 
shows that Zafar KhanDW-2 with Bilal (Officials of Rescue 1122) 
reached the place of occurrence and found Mureed Hussain 
(deceased) in injured condition, it is also mentioned on the Form 
in Urdu as under:- 
"انولعمم ارفاد یک افرئگن ےس داکن ےس وجےت رخدیےت وہےئ وگیل یگل (راریگہ)۔" 

6 
Criminal Appeal No.12779 of 2023 
Criminal PSLA No.19569 of 2023 
 
 
Above said Sami, who had informed Rescue Office, has 
not been produced being material witness by the prosecution 
with the reason best known to it. 
11. Muhammad RizwanDW-1 and Zafar KhanDW-2 being Rescue 
Officials have no grudge or ill-will against the complainant. 
Their statements and documents i.e. Exh. DJ and DK discard 
the presence of the eyewitnesses at relevant time. Had the 
eyewitnesses been present at the time of occurrence at the 
place of occurrence, their names would have been mentioned 
in above said documents i.e. Exh. DJ and DK prepared by the 
officials of Rescue Office. This was the reason that the 
prosecution has concealed shifting of the deceased/the then 
injured through official vehicle of Rescue 1122 to hospital, 
otherwise, it was the duty of prosecution to produce the above 
said 
public 
documents 
to 
establish 
the 
presence 
of 
eyewitnesses with the deceased at relevant time. Presumption 
of correctness is attached to them (public documents), certified 
copy thereof is relevant and admissible in evidence unless 
contrary is proved rebutting such presumption completely, in 
present case, prosecution has not produced any evidence to 
rebut the same which negates the presence of eyewitnesses at 
relevant time at the place of occurrence. 
12. It is the case of complainant that he along with his 
brother Ghulam Rasool reached the place of occurrence on 
motorcycle and witnessed the occurrence but neither the 
motorcycle nor its registration number has been produced 
before the IO to establish his presence. Likewise, it is 
mentioned in the FIR that Ikram Ullah KhanPW-12 (cousin "زاد "امومں of 
Muhammad Shoaib Khan (deceased)) was with the deceased and 
reached the place of occurrence on motorcycle and witnessed 
the occurrence but it is not mentioned that who was driving 
the motorcycle. In the FIR, presence of Hamza ShahPW-11 has 

7 
Criminal Appeal No.12779 of 2023 
Criminal PSLA No.19569 of 2023 
 
 
been disclosed after the occurrence which is also not 
believable.   
13. Statedly, 
on 
29.05.2019 
Mureed 
Hussain 
Shah 
(deceased/the then injured) was brought in the hospital in injured 
condition (died on 07.06.2019). Medical Officer Dr. Uzair Hashim 
NiaziPW-8 has specifically stated in his MLR as well as before the 
trial Court that during medical examination, he was not well-
oriented to space and time. GCS was 13/15. In these 
circumstances, statement of Mureed Hussain Shah (deceased/the 
then injured) statedly got recorded by the IO on the same day in 
the hospital along with endorsement of the medical officer is 
not free from doubt and had rightly not been considered by the 
trial Court as his dying declaration. 2016 SCMR 1233 
“Muhammad Ameer and another Vs. Riyat Khan and 
others”. 
14. All the eyewitnesses have specifically stated in their 
statements before the trial Court that fire shots of Shakeel 
Khan (co-convict tried separately being juvenile and has been acquitted by this 
Court today i.e. 28.11.2024 vide separate judgment while accepting his Crl. 
Appeal No.12776 of 2023 against his conviction) and Huzaifa Usman 
Khan (appellant) hit on the head of Muhammad Shoaib Khan 
(deceased). Medical Officer has not stated anywhere that injury 
observed by him on his head is result of two fire shots, in such 
eventuality, it is not discernable as to which of the accused 
is responsible for the said injury, otherwise both the 
accused could not have been convicted against single 
injury, benefit of which also goes to them.  
15. Neither name of the owner of the shop (Khyber Shoes), in 
front of which occurrence took place, has been disclosed nor 
has been produced in support of the prosecution story which 
also creates doubt. 
16. It is also worthwhile to point out that CCTV cameras 
installed on the adjacent shops of the place of occurrence as 

8 
Criminal Appeal No.12779 of 2023 
Criminal PSLA No.19569 of 2023 
 
 
stated by the IO (Ameer Ahmed Khan, SI/SHOCW-1) have not been taken 
into possession to establish presence of the eyewitnesses. 
17. Rough and scaled site plans of the place of occurrence 
do not show the houses of the eyewitnesses around the 
place of occurrence. They, being chance witnesses, have 
failed to establish their presence at the time of occurrence at 
the place of occurrence with their stated reasons. 2017 
SCMR 564 “Arshad Khan Vs. The State” and 2014 SCMR 
1698 “Muhammad Rafique Vs. The State”. 
18. Motive of the occurrence mentioned in the FIR was a 
quarrel between the parties took place few days prior to 
present occurrence, detail of which has not been disclosed 
which is not believable. 
19. Nothing was recovered from Sher Azam Khan (appellant) 
during interrogation. 
20. Nasir Iqbal, ConstablePW-13 while appearing before the 
trial Court stated in his statement that on 24.07.2019, 
Huzaifa 
Usman 
Khan 
(appellant) 
during 
interrogation 
disclosed and got recovered pistol from his house. I.O. has 
not joined any independent person from the vicinity to 
witness the recovery proceedings in violation of mandatory 
provisions of Section 103 of Cr.P.C. which are not 
believable. 2017 SCMR 898 “Muhammad Ismail and 
others Vs. The State”. 
21. In view of the above discussed circumstances, I entertain 
serious doubt in my mind regarding participation of the 
appellants and Zar Badshah co-accused (since acquitted) in the 
present case. It is settled principle of law that for giving benefit of 
doubt, it is not necessary that there should be many 
circumstances creating doubt. If there is a circumstance which 
creates reasonable doubt in the prudent mind about the guilt of 
the accused, then he would be entitled to its benefit not as a 
matter of grace or concession but as of right. 

9 
Criminal Appeal No.12779 of 2023 
Criminal PSLA No.19569 of 2023 
 
 
22. For the foregoing reasons, instant criminal appeal filed 
by the appellants (Sher Azam Khan and Huzaifa Usman Khan) is 
accepted, their convictions and sentences awarded by the trial 
Court through the impugned judgment are hereby set-aside. 
They are acquitted of the charges and directed to be released 
forthwith, if not required in any other case.  
23. In view of the above decision, Crl. PSLA filed by the 
complainant against the acquittal of co-accused (Zar Badshah), 
having no merits is dismissed.
