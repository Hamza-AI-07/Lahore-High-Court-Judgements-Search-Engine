VI-REMARKS BY MEDICAL OFFICER 
 
After thorough external and internal postmortem examination, I was of 
the opinion that Injury No.1,3, 5 and 9 have caused damaged to the blood 
vessels and excessive blood loss whereas Injury No.2 has caused damaged to 
meninges, cranial heamorrhage (sic) and neurogenic shock. Therefore, Injury 
No.1,3,5 and 9 and Injury No.2 have collectively caused death in this case. 
Such type of injuries were sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of 
nature. All the injuries were ante mortem in nature. Injury No.1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 
8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 were caused by sharp-edged weapon while injury No.2 and 
13 were caused by blunt object. The probable time that elapsed between injury 
and death was less than 15 minutes and between death and postmortem 
examination within 03 hours.”

24.03.2019 was posted as Medical Officer BV hospital, Bahawalpur and on

8. 
 After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court 
examined the appellants namely Khateeb Hussain son of Muhammad Hussain 
and Zafar Hussain son of Ghulam Hussain  under section 342 Cr.P.C. and in 
answer to question why this case against you and why the PWs have deposed 
against you, the appellants namely Khateeb Hussain son of Muhammad 
Hussain and Zafar Hussain son of Ghulam Hussain replied that they were 
innocent and had been falsely involved in the case due to suspicion. The 
appellants namely Khateeb Hussain son of Muhammad Hussain and Zafar 
Hussain son of Ghulam Hussain further stated that they had not committed 
any offence and were not involved in the occurrence in any manner.  The 
appellants namely Khateeb Hussain son of Muhammad Hussain and Zafar 
Hussain son of Ghulam Hussain opted not to get themselves examined under 
section 340(2) Cr.P.C.  however, the appellant namely Zafar Hussain got 
Shahid Aziz (DW-1) examined in his defence.  
 
9. 
 On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Judge, Anti-Terrorism Court, 
Bahawalpur Division, Bahawalpur,  convicted and sentenced the appellants as 
referred to above.   
 
10. 
 The contention of the learned counsels for the appellants precisely is 
that the whole case is fabricated and false. The learned counsels for the 
appellants submitted that the prosecution remained unable to prove the facts 
in issue and did not produce any unimpeachable, admissible and relevant 
evidence. The learned counsels for the appellants further contended that the 
statements of prosecution witnesses were not worthy of any reliance. The 
learned counsels for the appellants also submitted that the appellants had no

Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021

connection with the occurrence. The learned counsels for the appellants also 
argued that the recoveries were full of procedural defects, of no legal worth 
and value and result of fake proceedings. The learned counsels for the 
appellants finally submitted that the prosecution has totally failed to prove the 
case against the appellants beyond the shadow of a doubt.   
 
11. 
 On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with 
the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the complainant of the case 
contended that the prosecution has proved its case beyond the shadow of any 
uncertainty by producing independent witnesses. The learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
complainant of the case further argued that the appellant namely Khateeb 
Hussain was responsible for committing the Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased , 
whereas the appellant namely Zafar Hussain was responsible for not only 
instigating the said murder but also glorifying the same. The learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
complainant of the case further argued that the recoveries from the appellants 
also corroborated the prosecution account. The learned Deputy Prosecutor 
General along with the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
complainant of the case contended that there was no occasion for the 
prosecution witnesses to substitute the real offenders with the innocent in this 
case. Lastly, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned 
counsel appearing on behalf of the complainant of the case prayed for the 
rejection of appeals.

We have heard the learned counsels for the appellants, the learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
complainant of the case and with their assistance perused the record and 
evidence recorded during the trial. 
 
13. 
In the first instance, we would like to discuss the prosecution case with 
regard to the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain son of Muhammad Hussain 
(the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 43 ATA of 2021). In the instant 
unfortunate incident, Khalid Hameed, Assistant Professor as well as the Vice

had to start in the institution. The deceased namely Khalid Hameed, Assistant 
Professor as well as the Vice Principal, the Government Sadiq Egerton 
College, Bahawalpur suffered from as many as fifteen incised wounds  and 
two blunt traumas on his body during the incident and lost his life (Dr. Ahsan 
Firdous (PW-11), who conducted the post-mortem examination of the dead 
body of Khalid Hameed ,  though numbered the injuries observed on the dead 
body of the deceased as injury No.1 to injury No.13 , however, opined that 
injury No.3 was actually two different injuries and injury No.8 was also two 
separate injuries , whereas the injury No. 9 was actually three different 
injuries) . The prosecution in order to prove the ocular account, got Waleed 
Khan (PW-12), Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz 
(PW-14) examined. The prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) 
and Adnan Mustafa (PW-13)  were related to the deceased. The deceased

namely Adnan Mustafa (PW-13). It is also a fact that the the other  prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) was performing his 
duties as an Associate Professor, the Government Sadiq Egerton College, 
Bahawalpur, the same institution inside which Khalid Hameed (deceased) was 
murdered. The prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) , Adnan 
Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) explained their

We have noted that the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) 
, Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) , in a 
very natural and forthright manner, narrated the occurrence and gave each and 
every detail of the same. It is also an admitted fact that the  prosecution 
witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and 
Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) had no previous enmity with the 
appellant namely Khateeb Hussain and during the whole course of trial not 
even a suggestion was made that there existed any enmity of the appellant 
namely Khateeb Hussain with the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan 
(PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-
14), which could have motivated the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed 
Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz 
(PW-14), to depose against the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain. In this 
state of things, when the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-
12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14)  had 
provenly no enmity with the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain to involve 
him in the occurrence without any reason, then the prosecution witnesses 
namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad 
Waseem Nawaz (PW-14)  can be considered as independent witnesses.

Furthermore, during the course of cross-examination of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and 
Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14), the sequence of the arrival of the 
prosecution witnesses at the place of occurrence was probed and all the facts 
necessary to prove that the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-
12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) were 
present at the place of occurrence and also witnessed the same were brought 
on record and proved beyond doubt. It was stated by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) and Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) , that on the day 
of occurrence i.e 20.03.2019 at 8.40 a.m, they arrived at the Government 
Sadiq Egerton College, Bahawalpur to drop off  Khalid Hameed (deceased),  
as Khalid Hameed (deceased) was performing his duties as Assistant 
Professor as well as the Vice Principal  of the Government Sadiq Egerton 
College, Bahawalpur and just as Khalid Hameed (deceased) was proceeding 
towards his office, the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain initially hit Khalid 
Hameed (deceased) with an iron chain lock and thereafter gave repeated blows 
with the Churri (P-8), causing as may as fifteen injuries with the same on 
various parts of the body of Khalid Hameed (deceased), till  he died. During 
the course of cross-examination the prosecution witness namely Waleed Khan 
(PW-12) explained that his house was at a distance of  1.5 kilometres from the 
college, whereas  his shop was in front of the BV hospital, Bahawalpur which 
again was at a distance of 1.5 kilometres from the college, therefore, firstly , 
as a routine , he would drop off his father , the deceased namely Khalid 
Hameed at the college and then proceed to his shop. The prosecution witness 
namely  Waleed Khan (PW-12), during cross-examination, explained as 
under:- 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021

“My house is at a distance of about 1½ km from S.E. College/place of 
occurrence. House of Adnan Mustafa PW is about one km away from S.E. College. 
Distance between house of Ghulam Yasin PW and S.E.College is about 02 kms. 
Our house is situated towards Eastern side of S.E.College while that of Ghulam 
Yasin PW is situated towards Western side of S.E.College.  
………. 
 
I deal in medical equipments (sic).   In the days of occurrence, my shop was in front 
of B.V. Hospital, Bahawalpur. The distance between BV Hospital and S.E.College 
is about 1½ km. ” 
In this manner, it was quite natural and indeed the routine of the prosecution 
witness namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) to first drop his father at the college 
and then proceed to his shop. Similarly, the prosecution witness namely 
Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) also explained that on the  day of the occurrence he 
had accompanied the deceased and the prosecution witness namely Waleed 
Khan (PW-12)  , his maternal nephew, when he  witnessed the occurrence. 
The prosecution witness namely Adnan Mustafa (PW-13), during cross-
examination , explained as under:- 
“ I had gone to S.E. College on the day of occurrence. Khalid Hameed deceased 
was my brother-in-law (Behnoee).” 
As mentioned above, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Waseem 
Nawaz (PW-14) , was performing his duties as an Associate Professor, at the 
Government Sadiq Egerton College, Bahawalpur, the same institution inside 
which Khalid Hameed (deceased) was murdered and in his statement before 
the learned trial court explained that he was waiting for the teaching process 
to start when he was attracted to the place of occurrence after hearing the hue 
and cry and thereafter witnessed the occurrence. The prosecution witness 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
16 
 
namely Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) , during cross-examination , 
stated as under:- 
“I was sitting in staff room of college since about 10/15 minutes when I heard 
noise/commotions. The occurrence continued to take place in Veranda for about 
1½ or 02 minutes. No occurrence took place within our staff room. When I reached 
into the Veranda/place of occurrence, 03/04 persons had already gathered there. We 
were three Professors sitting in staff room when we heard commotions. The office 
room of the deceased is attached with the Veranda, where occurrence took place. 
The occurrence continued to take place also in office room of the deceased for about 
03/04 minutes. ” (emphasis supplied)  
During the course of the investigation and the trial, no question was raised 
regarding that the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Waseem Nawaz 
(PW-14) was not performing his duties as an Associate Professor, at the 
Government Sadiq Egerton College, Bahawalpur or that he was on leave on 
the day when the occurrence took place. In this manner, no exception can be 
taken to the presence of the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Waseem 
Nawaz (PW-14) at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence . During 
the course of cross-examination, the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed 
Khan (PW-12), Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz 
(PW-14)   remained consistent with regard to all the relevant facts. 
 
14.     The learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the prosecution 
witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and 
Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14)   made no effort to save the deceased 
which proved that they were not present at the place of occurrence, at the time 
of occurrence. This argument of learned counsel for the appellant is also not 
tenable for the reason that  the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
17 
 
(PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-
14)   explained that the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain  was so lethally 
quick in his actions that there hardly existed any opportunity for the 
prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-
13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14)  to have intervened and stopped 
the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain from continuing to give repeated blows 
to the deceased till his death. The prosecution witness namely Waleed Khan 
(PW-12) explained during cross-examination that he was standing at a 
distance of about 15 feet from his father as he was attacked and stated as 
under:- 
“I had shown the place to police where I was standing at the time of occurrence. The 
said place was at a distance of about 32 ft from the office of father. The said place 
was at a distance of about 12/15 ft from the Veranda, where my father was attacked 
by accused. We were three persons present at the place of occurrence when the 
accused started to cause injuries to my father. Many persons had gathered when my 
father was assaulted in the room of his office. ” 
It is also a fact that the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain was indeed caught 
hold by the witnesses as well as the other students who were attracted to the 
place of occurrence and thereafter the custody of the appellant namely 
Khateeb Hussain was handed over to the police authorities. Muhammad Imran 
(PW-2) stated that on 20.03.2019, the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain was 
restrained and detained by the witnesses along with the Churri. Similarly, 
Fahad Mustafa (PW-3) stated that on 20.03.2019, he had given first aid to the 
appellant namely Khateeb Hussain when he was present in the college having 
been  retained there by the witnesses. Muhammad Akhtar, SI (PW-8) also 
stated that at the time of receiving the written application (Exh.PE) , the 
custody of the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain along with the Churri (P-8) 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
18 
 
was handed over to him by the witnesses . The prosecution witnesses namely 
Waleed Khan (PW-12), Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem 
Nawaz (PW-14) also stated that they caught hold of the appellant namely 
Khateeb Hussain after the occurrence and handed over him to the police 
authorities. The prosecution witness namely Waleed Khan (PW-12), during 
cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“1 alongwith Ghulam Yasin and Adnan Mustafa had over powered the accused and 
I also mentioned this factum in application Exh.PE. When we apprehended the 
accused, my father had succumbed to the Injuries. 
………. 
I alongwith witnesses had handed over the 'churi' the weapon of offence to the 
police. The accused and 'churi' the weapon of offence, were in custody of students 
till arrival of police. ” 
The learned counsel for the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain remained 
unable to explain the fact of the arrest of the appellant namely Khateeb 
Hussain from the place of occurrence, while armed with the Churri (P-8) , just 
after the occurrence. Indeed, because the prosecution witnesses namely 
Waleed Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem 
Nawaz (PW-14) were present at the place of occurrence , at the time of 
occurrence , therefore, they were able to overcome and detain the appellant 
namely Khateeb Hussain alongwith the Churri  (P-8) and thereafter handed 
over the custody of the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain to the police 
authorities.  
 
15. 
We have also noted that the blood stained clothes of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) and  Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) were 
sent to the office of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for analysis 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
19 
 
and according to the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
(Exh.PGG), the Qameez (P-12), Shalwar (P-13) and Waistcoat (P-14) as worn 
by the prosecution witness namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) on the day of 
occurrence and the shirt (P-15) and the trouser (P-16) as worn by the 
prosecution witness namely Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) on the day of occurrence 
were found to be stained with human blood. The prosecution produced 
evidence with regard to the handing over the said clothes of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12)  and Adnan Mustafa (PW-13)  to 
the Investigating Officer of the case and their transmission from the Police 
Station to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. The presence of 
human blood the said clothes of the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed 
Khan (PW-12) and Adnan Mustafa (PW-13)  also proves that they were 
present at the place of occurrence and had indeed witnessed the same. 
Moreover, according to column No.8 of the inquest report (Exh.PH/1) relating 
to the deceased namely Khalid Hameed, at the time of preparation of the same, 
the eyes and mouth of the deceased were also closed and had the deceased 
met his death in absence of the witnesses, then his eyes and mouth would not 
have been found closed. Dr. Ahsan Firdous (PW-11) who conducted the post 
mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased namely Khalid 
Hameed, also noted that the eyes and the mouth of the deceased were closed 
at the time of the post mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased. 
It is correct that it is a tradition in Pakistan that after the death, people 
immediately close the eyes and mouth of the deceased. Thus, the closed eyes 
and mouth of the deceased at the time of the preparation of the inquest report 
further proves the prosecution's version regarding the presence of the 
witnesses at the place, at the time of occurrence.

16. 
The learned counsel for the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain has also 
argued repeatedly, that the place of occurrence could not be proved. We find 
that the said argument of the learned counsel for the appellant  namely 
Khateeb Hussain has no basis  for the fact that the prosecution witnesses 
namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad 
Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) explained with clarity that initially Khalid Hameed 
(deceased) was hit with a  chain lock by the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain 
as he was proceeding towards his office and subsequently the appellant 
Khateeb Hussain continued to inflict  fatal blows with the Churri (P-8) on the 
person of the deceased in his office and the deceased eventually lost his life 
inside his office.  The prosecution witness namely Waleed Khan (PW-12), 
stated during cross-examination, as under:- 
 “The dead body of my father was lying on ground of room of office. ” 
Similarly the prosecution witness namely Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) stated 
during cross-examination , as under:- 
“Police had collected blood from. place of occurrence in my presence from one 
place i.e. the room of office where the dead body of deceased was lying.” 
 Muhammad Ajmal, Inspector (PW-15),the Investigating Officer of the case, 
visited the place of occurrence and took into possession the blood-stained 
cotton through the recovery memo (Exh. P.R). The report of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.GG) establishes that the said blood 
stained cotton taken from the place of occurrence was of human origin. The 
place of occurrence was further established by the rough site plan of the place 
of occurrence (Exh. P.EE.) as prepared by Muhammad Ajmal, Inspector (PW-
15),the Investigating Officer of the case,  and the scaled site plan of the place 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
21 
 
of occurrence (Exh.PA) as prepared by Syed Gull Hassan Patwari (PW-1). A 
perusal of both the site plans (Exh. P.EE. and Exh.PA) reveals that the 
occurrence took place at the same place which was identified being the place 
of occurrence by the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) , 
Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14), being the 
office of the deceased inside the college . 
 
17.       Furthermore, as mentioned above, the occurrence in question had 
admittedly taken place in broad daylight at 08.40 a.m and the same, therefore, 
could not have gone un-witnessed nor could have the culprit escaped 
unobserved. As it was a broad daylight occurrence, the question of 
misidentification of the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain even does not 
arise. It is also a fact of the prosecution case that there was nothing in the line 
of sight of the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) , Adnan 
Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14)  which could 
have obstructed the view of the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan 
(PW-12), Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) 
and prevented them from witnessing the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain 
committing occurrence. According to the prosecution witness namely Waleed 
Khan (PW-12), he was at a distance of about 15 feet from his deceased father 
when he was attacked, whereas according to the prosecution witness namely 
Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) , he was also at a distance of about 18 feet from the 
place of occurrence , whereas the prosecution witness namely Muhammad 
Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) stated that he was at a distance of just 5/6 feet from 
the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain. The prosecution witness namely 
Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) , during cross-examination , stated as under:- 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
22 
 
“ I was 18/20 ft away from the place of occurrence at the time of occurrence.” 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) , 
during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“I was at a distance of 05/06 ft, from where the accused was apprehended. ” 
Furthermore, in the incident in issue, the weapon had been used from very 
close proximity and, thus, it would not have been difficult for the prosecution 
witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and 
Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14)   to identify the present appellant 
namely Khateeb Hussain. Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of 
“Muhammad Farhan Alias Irfan Versus The State” (2021 S C M R 488) 
wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held under:- 
 
“5.    The witnesses are closely related; the complainant lost his brother and a nephew 
related in no less degree with Muhammad Babar (PW-13) and Muhammad Waleed 
(PW-14) being father and brother, callously done to death in the midst of city during 
broad daylight, leaving no space to admit any hypothesis of substitution by the 
witnesses. Death of Malik Irfan and Arshad alias Pehlwan, nominated in the crime 
report alongside the appellant on the day one, while resisting a police encounter goes 
a long way to implicate the appellant as being a comrade in the crime.” 
 
18. 
We have also appreciated the fact that the occurrence in this case took 
place at about 08.40 a.m and was reported by the complainant namely Waleed 
Khan (PW-12), immediately. According to the prosecution evidence, the 
written application (Exh. P.E.) of Waleed Khan (PW-12)  was presented  to 
Muhammad Akhtar, SI (PW-8) at the place of occurrence, on the day of the 
occurrence at about 09.45 a.m. and thereafter the formal F.I.R (Exh.PD) was 
got registered at the Police Station on the same day at 09.55 a.m by Aamir Lal 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
23 
 
T/SI (PW-7). Thus, it is apparent that the written application (Exh. P.E.) of 
Waleed Khan (PW-12) was submitted immediately and the formal F.I.R 
(Exh.PD) was registered with remarkable promptitude, especially when 
Waleed Khan (PW-12) , the complainant of the case, had suffered the trauma 
of the death of his father  namely Khalid Hameed (deceased) at the hands of 
the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain, who himself was a student of the said 
college and was studying in the 5th semester of B.S English program offered 
by the college. Waleed Khan (PW-12) , not only named the appellant namely 
Khateeb Hussain but also mentioned each and every minor as well as a 
material fact of the incident in his written application (Exh. P.E.), which of 
course, excludes the possibility of deliberation or consultation regarding the 
false implication of the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain in the instant case. 
The essential features of the occurrence have been elaborately explained in 
the written application (Exh. P.E.) of Waleed Khan (PW-12). The promptitude 
in lodging of the F.I.R. also corroborates the case of the prosecution as against 
the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain. This promptitude in reporting the 
matter to the police also establishes the presence of the witnesses at the place 
of occurrence, at the time of occurrence and supports their narrative. Not only 
the written application (Exh.PE) was submitted with promptitude but the 
statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad 
Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) were also recorded immediately.  The learned 
counsel for the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain has vehemently argued that 
the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) stated 
that he had not joined the investigation of the case, therefore, his evidence had 
no value, however, we find that  the prosecution witness namely Muhammad 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
24 
 
Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) , during cross-examination , specifically stated that 
he had indeed got recorded his statement under section 161 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898. Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) , during 
cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“My statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C was recorded after an hour of arrival of the police at 
the spot, ” 
During the course of the trial, it was proved that the written application (Exh. 
PE.) of Waleed Khan (PW-12), upon the basis of which the formal F.I.R 
(Exh.PD) was registered, was a genuine document and was made 
spontaneously, naturally and contained the true facts, devoid of any 
manipulation. In this regard, reference is made to the judgment in the case 
titled as “Muhammad Waris  v. The State” (2008 SCMR 784) wherein the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to observe as under:-- 
 “The names of the said two eye-witnesses could not have been mentioned 
in such a promptly lodged F.I.R. if they had not been with the deceased 
persons at the time of their death.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of MUHAMMAD ARSHAD Versus The 
State (2020 S C M R 2025) wherein it has been held as under:- 
“There is no denial to this fact that the instant occurrence has taken place in 
broad daylight in which one person was done to death in a brutal manner 
whereas 02 women folk were given severe injuries. The crime report was lodged 
with promptitude, although the inter-se distance between the place of occurrence 
and the police station is 10-KM. The facts and figures narrated above, rules out 
any possibility of deliberation and consultation. Further that there is only single 
accused nominated in the crime report which shows the fairness of the 
prosecution which normally is against the prevalent custom in our society.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of Noor Sultan and others Versus The State 
(2021 S C M R 176) wherein it has been held as under:- 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
25 
 
“The instant occurrence has taken place on 28.02.2020 at 6.15 p.m. while 
the matter was reported to the police within 2.15 hours whereas inter-se 
distance between the place of occurrence and police station is 16 kilometers. 
Promptness in reporting the matter to the police reflect that there is no 
chance of any consultation or deliberation at the part of prosecution.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of Shaheen Ijaz Alias Babu Versus The State 
(2021 S C M R 500) wherein it has been held as under:- 
                      “ ……….petitioner's nomination in a broad daylight incident by resident 
witnesses hardly admits a space to entertain any hypothesis of mistaken 
identity or substitution. Prompt recourse to law straight at the police station 
excludes every possibility of deliberation or consultation.”’ 
Reference is also made to the judgment in the case titled as “Muhammad Aslam 
v. The State” (2012 SCMR 593) wherein the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan was pleased to observe as under:-- 
 
“F.I.R. in the present case was recorded with a promptitude and in such 
circumstances prosecution has been able to prove the case against the 
appellant beyond any shadow of doubt.” 
 
19. 
We have noted that not only the written application (Exh. P.E.) of 
Waleed Khan (PW-12)  and the formal F.I.R (Exh.PD) were recorded with 
promptitude but the post mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased 
was also conducted without any loss of time. According to the statement of  
Dr. Ahsan Firdous (PW-11), he conducted the Post-Mortem Examination of 
the dead body of the deceased  on 20.03.2019 at 10.45 a.m when the 
occurrence had taken place on 20.03.2019 at 08.40 a.m and the written 
application (Exh. P.E.) of Waleed Khan (PW-12)  had been submitted on 
20.03.2019 at 09.45 a.m and the formal F.I.R (Exh.PD) had been registered on 
20.03.2019 at 09.55 a.m. Dr. Ahsan Firdous (PW-11) also explained that  prior 
to conducting the post mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased , 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
26 
 
the deceased had not been examined or treated by anyone. Dr. Ahsan Firdous 
(PW-11), during cross-examination , explained as under:- 
“Professor Khalid Hameed's dead body was received by me, therefore, no question 
arises of any first aid and report thereon.” 
The promptitude in the holding of the post mortem examination of the dead 
body of the deceased also proves that the prosecution witnesses namely 
Waleed Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem 
Nawaz (PW-14) had witnessed the occurrence and thereafter  the prosecution 
witness namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) reported the same to the police 
promptly and therefore, after completing all the formalities, the post mortem 
examination of the dead body of the deceased was conducted within two hours 
of the occurrence. 
 
20. 
 The medical evidence produced by the prosecution in the case, proves 
that the deceased, namely Khalid Hameed, succumbed to the injuries caused 
by the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain. The medical evidence fully 
supports the ocular account. Dr. Ahsan Firdous (PW-11) noted presence of as 
many as fifteen incised wounds and two blunt traumas on the body of the 
deceased. Dr. Ahsan Firdous (PW-11)  further opined that the fifteen incised 
wounds  (Dr. Ahsan Firdous (PW-11)  though numbered the injuries observed on the 
dead body of the deceased as injury No.1 to injury No.13 , however, opined that injury 
No.3 was actually two different injuries and injury No.8 was also two separate injuries , 
whereas the injury No. 9 was actually three different injuries) observed by him on the 
dead body of Khalid Hameed son of Muhammad Sharif (deceased) were 
caused by the use of a sharp edged weapon and were sufficient to cause death 
in the ordinary course of nature. As mentioned above, the prosecution 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
27 
 
witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12), Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and 
Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) saddled the appellant with the 
responsibility of causing the said fatal injuries to Khalid Hameed son of 
Muhammad Sharif  (deceased). The opinion of Dr. Ahsan Firdous (PW-11) 
with regard to the time which elapsed between the receiving of the injuries by 
the deceased and his death as and the time which elapsed between the death 
of the deceased and the post mortem examination also offers further 
corroboration of the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed 
Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz 
(PW-14). In view of the above discussion, it is ascertained and proved that the 
intent of the appellant  namely Khateeb Hussain was to cause death and that 
he is guilty of Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased namely Khalid Hameed son of 
Muhammad Sharif . 
 
21. 
We have also noted that the Churri (P-8) which was recovered from the 
possession of the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain after he was 
overwhelmed by the witnesses was sent to the Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore for analysis and according to the report of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PGG), the DNA profile obtained from 
the stained section of the shirt of the deceased and the DNA profile obtained 
from the blade of the Churri (P-8)  recovered from the appellant namely 
Khateeb Hussain matched the DNA profile of the deceased. Furthermore, the 
DNA profile obtained from the shirt of the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain 
matched the DNA profile of the deceased also. In this manner, the report of 
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PGG) provides further 
proof against the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain.

22. 
We have also noted that the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed 
Khan (PW-12), Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz 
(PW-14) also proved the motive which prevailed with the appellant namely 
Khateeb Hussain for committing the murder of Khalid Hameed (deceased) as 
being annoyed by holding of a function.  During the course of the 
investigation, the application (P-26) submitted for the holding of the said 
function was taken into possession. The prosecution witnesses namely 
Waleed Khan (PW-12), Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem 
Nawaz (PW-14) also gave evidence that the appellant namely Khateeb 
Hussain ,after attacking the deceased, raised a cry that he, being annoyed by 
the announcement of holding of the said function, had murdered the deceased. 
 
23. 
 We have noted that the iron chain lock (P-32) was also shown to be 
had got recovered by the appellant Khateeb Hussain on 21.03.2021 but as the 
said recovery was made from the vicinity of the place of occurrence, hence 
we are  not believing the said recovery as abundant caution. We have also 
noted that a video footage contained in a memory card (Exh.P-18/1) was also 
handed over  by the complainant of the case to the Investigating Officer of the 
case  on 30.03.2019, which video footage showed the appellant namely 
Khateeb Hussain admitting to his guilt, however, Muhammad Ajmal, 
Inspector (PW-15),the Investigating Officer of the case, admitted during 
cross-examination that he had not recorded the statement of the person who 
had recorded the said video footage as contained in a memory card (Exh.P-
18/1), therefore, in absence of that proof, the said video footage as contained 
in a memory card (Exh.P-18/1) cannot be considered as admissible evidence.

24.    We have scrutinized the evidence of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Waleed Khan (PW-12), Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem 
Nawaz (PW-14)   and find that they proved themselves to be truthful witnesses 
and implicit reliance can be placed upon their statements. Not even a single 
inconsistency could be brought up in their statements during cross-
examination despite the fact that the prosecution witnesses namely Waleed 
Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz 
(PW-14)   were cross-examined at length. There is no evidence on record that 
the said prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12), Adnan 
Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14)   were motivated 
by any enmity to depose against the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain. The 
prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12), Adnan Mustafa (PW-
13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14)  were subjected to cross-
examination but the defence failed to make cracks in their depositions and the 
genuineness of their statements has been proved. Moreover, during the cross-
examination, the sequence of the occurrence was brought on record and the 
witnesses remained consistent. Hence, in view of the above facts, the 
prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-
13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14), by no stretch of the 
imagination, can be declared as chance witnesses or be declared not to be 
present at the time of occurrence as they explained their arrival at the place of 
occurrence in the most natural and consistent manner. The presence of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12), Adnan Mustafa (PW-
13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) at the place of occurrence, at 
the time of occurrence, stands proved beyond a shadow of doubt.

Additionally, prosecution witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12), Adnan 
Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) had no reason to 
falsely implicate the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain in the commission of 
the offence or substituting the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain and letting 
off the real culprit. There is no such material available on record that would 
indicate substitution of the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain in the case with 
the real culprit. Substitution is a phenomenon of a rare manifestation because 
even the interested witnesses would not normally allow the real culprit for the 
murder of their relations to let off by involving an innocent person. In this 
context, reference can usefully be made to the case of “Irshad Ahmad and 
others v. The State and others” (PLD 1996 SC 138). The prosecution 
witnesses namely Waleed Khan (PW-12), Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and 
Muhammad Waseem Nawaz (PW-14)  in a forthright manner, held the 
appellant namely Khateeb Hussain  responsible for committing the Qatl-i-
Amd of the deceased namely Khalid Hameed . 
 
25. 
The learned counsel for the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain has also 
argued that the appellant was aged about 21 years at the time of occurrence, 
hence, the same may be considered as a ground for awarding lesser sentence. 
Being young of age on its own is not a mitigating circumstance as held by the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Yar v. The State” 
(1997 SCMR 401) wherein it was observed as  under:-- 
"Lastly an objective attempt was made by the learned counsel for the appellant that 
the appellant was young boy of 18 years, hence his sentence may be altered from 
death to life imprisonment. We are not convinced by his such contention. Young 
age by itself is not a mitigating circumstance. The appellant had killed three persons 
in broad daylight. He does not deserve any sympathy. We have gone through the 
evidence produced by the prosecution, (sic) in juxtaposition. The trial Court as well 
as the Appellate Court have properly assessed the evidence produced by the 
prosecution and the defence version. It is neither the case of misreading or non-
reading of the evidence. Hence there is no material in the appeal which may call for

Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021

31 
 
interference by this Court. In result of our above said observations the appeal is 
dismissed." 
Reliance is placed upon the case of “Faisal Aleem v. The State” (PLD 2010 SC 
1080) wherein august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:-- 
`There is no cavil to the proposition that youth of accused alone does not constitute 
such an extenuating circumstance as would justify imposition of lesser penalty 
prescribed by law" Harnamun v. Emperor (AIR 1928 Lah. 855), Maghar Singh 
Naghar Singh and others v. Emperor (AIR 1941 Lah. 220), The State v. Tasiruddin 
(PLD 1962 Dacca 46), Sher Hassan v. The State (PLD 1959 SC (Pak) 480), Ghulam 
Hyder v. The State (1970 PCr.LJ 1052)". 
 
26.           We have also noted that the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain has 
been convicted and sentenced for the commission of offences under sections 
7 (a) and 7(h) of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 ,however have found that the 
prosecution did not prove that the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain had 
committed offences under sections 7 (a) and 7(h) of the Anti-terrorism Act, 
1997 . Undeniably, it is an admitted fact that provisions of Anti-terrorism Act, 
1997  are co-related and ancillary to the substantive offence, which in all 
fairness is the provision of section 302, P.P.C. The gravity of said substantive 
offence can lead the court to the conclusion whether the provisions of Anti-
terrorism Act, 1997  are attracted or not. Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 is a special 
law enacted with a special intent and purpose, which can be gathered from the 
bare reading of Preamble of the said Act. It is principle of legislation that the 
preamble of any enactment is always considered as grundnorm of the 
legislation, which expresses the postulates to attract the said provision of the 
enactment according to its scope of legislation. As stated above, the Anti-
terrorism Act, 1997  is a special enactment and a special enactment needs to 
be taken in perspective of its own object. Any departure from the same would 
be a negation of its object and spirit. A preamble of a statute explains the very 
purpose and underlying philosophy behind the enactment. To better

understand the scheme of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997, it would be in order to 
reproduce the Preamble of the Act, which reads as under:- 
 
       "An act to provide for the prevention of terrorism, sectarian violence and for 
speedy trial of heinous offences; 
 
       Whereas it is expedient to provide for the prevention of terrorism, sectarian 
violence and for speedy trial of heinous offences and for matters connected 
therewith and incidental thereto;” 
 
A bare perusal of the Preamble shows that the basic purpose behind the 
enactment of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997, was to prevent, (i) terrorism, (ii) 
sectarian violence, and (iii) for speedy trial of heinous offences. The word 
"terrorism" has been given the same meaning as assigned in section 6 of the 
Anti-terrorism Act, 1997, which reads as under:- 
 
“6. Terrorism.---(1) In this Act, "terrorism" means the use or threat of action 
where:- 
 
(a)   the action falls within the meaning of subsection (2); and 
 
(b)   the use or threat is designed to coerce and intimidate or overawe the 
Government or the public or a section of the public or community or sect or a 
foreign government or population or an international organization or create a sense 
of fear or insecurity in society; or 
 
(c)   the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a religious, sectarian or 
ethnic cause or intimidating and terrorizing the public, social sectors, media 
persons, business community or attacking the civilians, including damaging 
property by ransacking, looting, arson or by any other means, government officials, 
installations, security forces or law enforcement agencies: 
 
       Provided that nothing herein contained shall apply to a democratic and 
religious rally or a peaceful demonstration in accordance with law. 
 
(2)   An "action" shall fall within the meaning of subsection (1), if it:- 
 
(a)   involves the doing of any thing that causes death; 
 
(b)   involves grievous violence against a person or grievous bodily injury or harm 
to a person; 
 
(c)   involves grievous damage to property including government premises, official 
installations, schools, hospitals, offices or any other public or private property 
including damaging property by ransacking, looting or arson or by any others 
means; 
 
(d)   involves the doing of any thing that is likely to cause death or endangers 
person's life; 
 
(e)   involves kidnapping for ransom, hostage-taking or hijacking;

(ee) involves use of explosive by any device including bomb blast 2[or having any 
explosive substance without any lawful justification or having been unlawfully 
concerned with such explosive; 
 
(f)    incites hatred and contempt on religious, sectarian or ethnic basis to strip up 
violence or cause internal disturbance; 
 
(g)   involves taking the law in own hand, award of any punishment by an 
organization, individual or group whatsoever, not recognized by the law, with a 
view to coerce, intimidate or terrorize public, individuals, groups, communities, 
government officials and institutions, including law enforcement agencies beyond 
the purview of the law of the land; 
 
(h)   involves firing on religious congregation, mosques, imambargahs, churches, 
temples and all other places or worship, or random firing to spread panic, or 
involves any forcible takeover of mosques or other places of worship; 
 
(i)    creates a serious risk to safety of the public or a section of the public, or is 
designed to frighten the general public and thereby prevent them from coming out 
and carrying on their lawful trade and daily business, and disrupts civic life; 
 
(j)    involves the burning of vehicles or any other serious form of arson; 
 
(i)    involves extortion of money ("bhatta") or property; 
 
(l)    is designed to seriously interfere with or seriously disrupt a communication 
system or public utility service; 
 
(m)  involves serious coercion or intimidation of a public servant in order to force 
him to discharge or to refrain from discharging his lawful duties; 
 
(n)   involves serious violence against a member of the police force, armed forces, 
civil armed forces, or a public servant; 
 
(o)   involves in acts as part of armed resistance by groups or individuals against 
law enforcement agencies; or 
 
(p)   involves in dissemination, preaching ideas, teachings and beliefs as per own 
interpretation on FM stations or through any other means of communication 
without explicit approval of the government or its concerned departments.] 
 
(3)   The use or threat of use of any action falling within subsection (2) which 
involves the use of firearms, explosive or any other weapon is terrorism, whether 
or not subsection (1)(c) is satisfied. 
 
(3A)            Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (1), an action in 
violation of a convention specified in the Fifth Schedule shall be an act of terrorism 
under this Act. 
 
(4)   In this section "action" includes an act or a series of acts. 
 
(5)   In this Act, terrorism includes any act done for the benefit of a proscribed 
organization. 
 
(6)   A person who commits an offence under this section or any other provision of 
this Act, shall be guilty of an act of terrorism. 
 
(7)   In this Act, a "terrorist" means:-

(a)   an individual who has committed an offence of terrorism under this Act, and 
is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation, 1[facilitation, funding] or 
instigation of acts of terrorism; 
 
(b)   an individual who is or has been, whether before or after the coming into force 
of this Act, concerned in the commission, preparation, 1[facilitation, funding] or 
instigation of acts of terrorism, shall also be included in the meaning given in clause 
(a) above.” 
 
Section 6 of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 defines terrorist acts, section 7 of 
the  Anti-terrorism Act,1997 provides punishment for such acts whereas 
section 8 of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 prohibits acts intended or likely to 
stir up sectarian hatred mentioned in clauses (a) to (d) thereof. The word 
"sectarian" has been described as "pertaining to, devoted to, peculiar to, or 
one which promotes the interest of a religious sects, or sects, in a bigoted or 
prejudicial manner". However, the word "heinous offence" has not been 
described in the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997. In common parlance "heinous 
offence" means an offence which is serious, gruesome, brutal, sensational in 
character or shocking to public morality and which is punishable under laws 
of the land. A bare reading of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997  reveals that an 
Anti-Terrorism Court has been conferred jurisdiction not only to try all those 
offences which attract the definition of 'terrorism' provided by the Anti-
terrorism Act, 1997 but also some other cases, which have been specified in 
Third Schedule of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 involving heinous offences 
which do not fall in the said definition of terrorism. The sole purpose of trying 
such offences by the Anti-Terrorism Court is for speedy trial of such heinous 
offences irrespective of the fact that they do not fall within the ambit of 
'terrorism'. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Ghulam 
Hussain v. The State” (PLD 2020 SC 61), while elaborately discussing the 
scope and intent of the legislature behind the enactment of Anti-terrorism Act, 
1997 ,  has held that "an act of 'terrorism' is not just a grave offence but it is a

class and species apart and this class or species has to be understood in its true 
and correct perception and perspective otherwise every serious offence may 
be found by one Judge or the other to involve terrorism depending upon a 
subjective assessment of the potential of the act to create some sense of fear 
or insecurity in some section of the society as such an approach may not be 
wholesome as it may ultimately result in every case of a serious offence 
landing in a Special Court and thereby rendering the ordinary courts 
substantially redundant. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan  declared in 
the case of “Mumtaz Ali Khan Rajban and another v. Federation of Pakistan 
and others” (PLD 2001 SC 169) that the subject matters of the Suppression 
of Terrorist Activities (Special Courts) Act, 1975 and the Anti-terrorism Act, 
1997 , were "different" and their respective applicability was "governed by 
different criteria". The august Supreme Court of Pakistan  further held that the 
"distinction between cases of terrorism and cases of specified heinous 
offences not amounting to terrorism but triable by an Anti- Terrorism Court 
has already been recognized by this Court in the cases of Farooq Ahmed v. 
State and another (2020 SCMR 78), Amjad Ali and others v. The State (PLD 
2017 SC 661) and Muhammad Bilal v. The State and others (2019 SCMR 
1362)”. It has been clarified by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan  that 
such specified heinous offences are only to be tried by an Anti-Terrorism 
Court and that court can punish the person committing such specified heinous 
offences only for commission of those offences and not for committing 
terrorism because such offences do not constitute terrorism. The cases of the 
offences specified in entry No. 4 of the Third Schedule to the Anti-terrorism 
Act, 1997 , are cases of those heinous offences which do not per se constitute 
the offence of terrorism but such cases are to be tried by an Anti-Terrorism

Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021

Court because of their inclusion in the Third Schedule. In cases of heinous 
offences mentioned in entry No. 4 of the said Schedule,  an Anti-Terrorism 
Court can pass a punishment for the said offence and not for committing the 
offence of terrorism. It may be pertinent to mention here that the offence of 
abduction or kidnapping for ransom under section 365-A, P.P.C. is included 
in entry No. 4 of the Third Schedule and kidnapping for ransom is also one of 
the actions specified in section 7(e) of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 but an 
ordinary case of abduction or kidnapping for ransom under section 365-A, 
P.P.C. is merely triable by an Anti-Terrorism Court but if kidnapping for 
ransom is committed with the design or purpose mentioned in clauses (b) or 
(c) of subsection (1) of section 6 of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 , then such 
offence amounts to terrorism attracting section 7(e) of that Act. In the former 
case, the convicted person is to be convicted and sentenced only for the 
offence under section 365-A, P.P.C. whereas in the latter case, the convicted 
person is to be convicted both for the offence under section 365-A, P.P.C. as 
well as for the offence under section 7(e) of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 . The 
same may also be said about the other offences mentioned in entry No. 4 of 
the Third Schedule to the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997 pertaining to "Use of 
firearms or explosives by any device, including bomb blast in a mosque, 
imambargah, church, temple or any other place of worship, whether or not 
any hurt or damage is caused thereby", "Firing or use of explosive by any 
device, including bomb blast in the court premises", "Hurt caused by corrosive 
substance or attempt to cause hurt by means of a corrosive substance" and 
"Unlawful possession of an explosive substance or abetment for such an 
offence under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908". Such distinction between 
cases of terrorism and other heinous offences by itself explains and recognizes

that all heinous offences, howsoever serious, grave, brutal, gruesome, 
macabre or shocking, do not ipso facto constitute terrorism which is a species 
apart. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan  in the case of “Ghulam Hussain 
And Others Versus The State and Others” (P L D 2020 Supreme Court 61) 
has held as under :- 
 
“15.  The resume of our legislative developments in the field of terrorism shows, 
as already observed in the case of Basharat Ali (supra), that with different laws and 
definitions of terrorist act or terrorism the emphasis has been shifting from one 
criterion to another including the gravity of the act, lethal nature of the weapon 
used, plurality of culprits, number of victims, impact created by the act and effect 
of fear and insecurity brought about or likely to be created in the society by the 
action. The last definition of a 'terrorist act' contained in section 6 of the Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 squarely focused on the effect of fear and insecurity intended 
to be created by the act or actually created by the act or the act having the potential 
of creating such an effect of fear and insecurity in the society. It, however, appears 
that subsequently the legislature did not feel convinced of the aptness or correctness 
of that definition and resultantly the erstwhile definition of a 'terrorist act' contained 
in section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 was repealed and a totally fresh and 
new definition of 'terrorism' was introduced through an amended section 6 of the 
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The legislature had probably realized by then that an 
effect of an act may not always be a correct indicator of the nature of such an act as 
every crime, especially of violence against person or property, does create some 
sense of fear and insecurity in some section of the society and a definition of 
terrorism based upon the magnitude or potential of an effect created or intended to 
be created or having a potential of creating would necessarily require a premature, 
speculative and imaginary quantification of the effect so as to determine the nature 
of the act in order to decide about the jurisdiction of a criminal court to try such an 
act. That surely was an unsure test and the result of such a premature, speculative 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
38 
 
and presumptive test could vary from court to court and from Judge to Judge 
reminding a legal scholar of the Star Chamber and the early days of a Court of 
Equity in England where equity was said to vary with the size of the Chancellor's 
foot. The new definition of 'terrorism' introduced through the amended section 6 of 
the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 as it stands today appears to be closer to the 
universally understood concept of terrorism besides being easier to understand and 
apply. The earlier emphasis on the speculative effect of the act has now given way 
to a clearly defined mens rea and actus reus. The amended clause (b) of subsection 
(1) of section 6 now specifies the 'design' and clause (c) of subsection (1) of section 
6 earmarks the 'purpose' which should be the motivation for the act and the actus 
reus has been clearly mentioned in subsection (2) of section 6 and now it is only 
when the actus reus specified in subsection (2) of section 6 is accompanied by the 
requisite mens rea provided for in clause (b) or clause (c) of subsection (1) of 
section 6 that an action can be termed as 'terrorism'. Thus, it is no longer the fear or 
insecurity actually created or intended to be created or likely to be created which 
would determine whether the action qualifies to be termed as terrorism or not but it 
is now the intent and motivation behind the action which would be determinative 
of the issue irrespective of the fact whether any fear and insecurity was actually 
created or not. After this amendment in section 6 an action can now be termed as 
terrorism if the use or threat of that action is designed to coerce and intimidate or 
overawe the Government or the public or a section of the public or community or 
sect, etc. or if such action is designed to create a sense of fear or insecurity in the 
society or the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a religious, 
sectarian or ethnic cause, etc. Now creating fear or insecurity in the society is not 
by itself terrorism unless the motive itself is to create fear or insecurity in the society 
and not when fear or insecurity is just a byproduct, a fallout or an unintended 
consequence of a private crime. In the last definition the focus was on the action 
and its result whereas in the present definition the emphasis appears to be on the 
motivation and objective and not on the result. Through this amendment the 
legislature seems to have finally appreciated that mere shock, horror, dread or 

Capital Sentence Reference No.2 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 43-ATA of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021 
 
 
39 
 
disgust created or likely to be created in the society does not transform a private 
crime into terrorism but terrorism as an 'ism' is a totally different concept which 
denotes commission of a crime with the design or purpose of destabilizing the 
government, disturbing the society or hurting a section of the society with a view 
to achieve objectives which are essentially political, ideological or religious. This 
approach also appears to be in harmony with the emerging international perspective 
and perception about terrorism. The international perception is also becoming 
clearer on the point that a violent activity against civilians that has no political, 
ideological or religious aims is just an act of criminal delinquency, a felony, or 
simply an act of insanity unrelated to terrorism. This metamorphosis in the anti-
terrorism law in our country has brought about a sea change in the whole concept 
as we have understood it in the past and it is, therefore, of paramount importance 
for all concerned to understand this conceptual modification and transformation in 
its true perspective. 
16. For what has been discussed above it is concluded and declared that for an 
action or threat of action to be accepted as terrorism within the meanings of section 
6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 the action must fall in subsection (2) of section 
6 of the said Act and the use or threat of such action must be designed to achieve 
any of the objectives specified in clause (b) of subsection (1) of section 6 of that 
Act or the use or threat of such action must be to achieve any of the purposes 
mentioned in clause (c) of subsection (1) of section 6 of that Act. It is clarified that 
any action constituting an offence, howsoever grave, shocking, brutal, gruesome or 
horrifying, does not qualify to be termed as terrorism if it is not committed with the 
design or purpose specified or mentioned in clauses (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of 
section 6 of the said Act. It is further clarified that the actions specified in subsection 
(2) of section 6 of that Act do not qualify to be labeled or characterized as terrorism 
if such actions are taken in furtherance of personal enmity or private vendetta.” 
 
In the instant case we have noted that according to the prosecution witnesses 
namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) , Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) and Muhammad

Waseem Nawaz (PW-14) , the motive which prevailed with the appellant 
namely Khateeb Hussain for committing the murder of Khalid Hameed 
(deceased) was his annoyance over aanouncement of holding of a function by 
the deceased.  None of the prosecution witnesses stated that the appellant 
namely Khateeb Hussain designed to coerce and intimidate any section of the 
public or committed the act of murder of the deceased for 
purpose of advancing a religious, sectarian or ethnic cause , though it could 
be said that the act of the appellant did lead to developing a sense of fear and 
insecurity in the teachers and students. Only creating of sense of fear or 
insecurity in the society is not by itself terrorism , unless the motive itself is 
to create fear or insecurity in the society and not when fear or insecurity is just 
a byproduct, a fallout or an unintended consequence of a crime and mere 
shock, horror, dread or disgust created or likely to be created in the society,  
does not transform a crime into terrorism. Therefore, we have arrived at an 
irresistible conclusion that the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain could not 
have been convicted for the offences made punishable under sections 7(a) and 
7(h) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. Similarly, we have also concluded that 
the prosecution could not prove that the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain 
had committed any offence made punishable under section 353 P.P.C. as no 
evidence was brought on record in this regard.

For what has been discussed above, we have come to an irresistible and 
clear conclusion the prosecution has proved beyond any shadow of 
doubt,through inspiring and truthful evidence, that the appellant namely 
Khateeb Hussain ( the appellant in the Criminal Appeal No. 43-ATA  of 2021) 
committed the Qatl-i-Amd of Khalid Hameed (deceased).  We have also arrived

at the conclusion that the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain does not deserve 
any leniency in the matter of the sentence of death awarded to him under section 
302 (b) P.P.C. In this regard, reliance is placed upon the case of “Tariq Iqbal 
Alias Tariq Versus The State (2017 S C M R 594) . In view of the conclusions 
drawn by us, the Criminal Appeal No. 43-ATA  of 2021 as lodged by the 
appellant namely Khateeb Hussain son of Muhammad Hussain is partly allowed 
and  the conviction and sentences of the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain son 
of Muhammad Hussain  for the offences made punishable under sections 7(a) 
and 7(h) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and under section 353 P.P.C. are set-
aside, however, the conviction and the sentence awarded to the appellant namely 
Khateeb Hussain son of Muhammad Hussain under section 302 (b) P.P.C. are 
upheld and maintained. 
 
 
28. 
We would now discuss the case of the appellant namely Zafar Hussain 
(the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.34-ATA of 2021).   With regard to the 
case of the appellant namely Zafar Hussain (the appellant in Criminal Appeal 
No.34-ATA of 2021), we find that the prosecution could not prove the charges 
against him. The appellant namely Zafar Hussain (the appellant in Criminal 
Appeal No.34-ATA of 2021) was alleged to had abetted the commission of the 
crimes committed by Khateeb Hussain(the appellant in Criminal Appeal 
No.43-ATA of 2021), however, the prosecution witnesses candidly admitted 
that they had no knowledge of such abetment by the appellant namely Zafar 
Hussain (the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.34-ATA of 2021). The 
prosecution witness namely Waleed Khan (PW-12) admitted during cross-
examination, as under:-

Criminal Appeal    No. 34-ATA of 2021

“It is correct that I have no personal knowledge about instigation of Zafar Hussain 
accused to Khateeb Hussain accused regarding commission of murder of my father” 
Similarly, the prosecution witness namely Adnan Mustafa (PW-13) , also 
admitted during cross-examination , as under:- 
“ I have no personal knowledge/evidence or material regarding allegation of 
instigation by Syed Zafar Hussain to Khateeb Hussain accused for committing 
murder of deceased Khalid Hameed,” 
 
Syed Muhammad Imran Naqvi, SI (PW-9), though stated that  on 21.03.2019, 
Muhammad Ajmal, Inspector (PW-15) handed over to him the Mobile Phone 
Device recovered from the appellant namely Khateeb Hussain (the appellant 
in Criminal Appeal No.43-ATA of 2021) for analysis and he also prepared three 
pages (P-10/1-3) relating to the screenshots of the conversation between the 
appellants using WhatsApp Messenger, however, he too admitted that  he had 
not mentioned that the appellant namely Zafar Hussain (the appellant in 
Criminal Appeal No.34-ATA of 2021) had abetted the commission of the 
crimes committed by Khateeb Hussain (the appellant in Criminal Appeal 
No.43-ATA of 2021). Syed Muhammad Imran Naqvi, SI (PW-9), during cross-
examination , admitted as under:- 
“It is correct that I have not mentioned in my report that Zafar Hussain accused 
present in the Court has instigated accused Khateeb Hussain for doing away with 
Professor Khalid Hameed (since deceased), however there inter se liaison surfaced 
through different modes.” 
With regard to conviction of the appellant namely Zafar Hussain (the 
appellant in Criminal Appeal No.34-ATA of 2021) under sections 21-I and 11-
W of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997,  what has been made punishable under 
section 21-I of the Anti-Terrorism Act,1997 is the abetment of any offence 
under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 , and what has been made punishable

under section 11-W of the Anti-Terrorism Act,1997 is the printing,  
publishing,  or  disseminating  any  material  to  incite  hatred  or  giving 
projection to any person convicted for a terrorist act or any proscribed 
organization or an organization placed under observation or anyone concerned 
in terrorism. Section 11-W of the Anti-Terrorism Act,1997 provides as 
under:- 
“11W.  Printing,  publishing,  or  disseminating  any  material  to  incite  hatred  or  
giving projection to any person convicted for a terrorist act or any proscribed 
organization or an organization placed under observation or anyone concerned in 
terrorism.- (1) A person commits an offence if he prints, publishes or disseminates 
any material, whether by audio or video-cassettes or  any  form  of  data,  storage  
devise,  FM  radio  station  or  by  any  visible  sign]  or  by  written photographic, 
electronic, digital, wall chalking or any other method or means of communication] 
which glorifies terrorists or terrorist activities or incites religious, sectarian or 
ethnic hatred or gives projection to any person convicted for a terrorist act, or any 
person or organization concerned in terrorism or proscribed organization or an 
organization placed under observation”. 
Section 21-I of the Anti-Terrorism Act,1997 provides as under:- 
“21I. Aid an abetment. Whoever aids or abets any offence, under this Act shall be 
punishable with the maximum term of same imprisonment provided for the offence 
or the fine provided for such offence or with both” 
However, as we have already concluded that the prosecution failed to establish 
that any offence made punishable under Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 had been 
committed, therefore, the conviction of the appellant namely Zafar Hussain 
(the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.34-ATA of 2021) under sections 21-I 
and 11-W of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 cannot be maintained. In view of 
the above discussion, the Criminal Appeal No.34-ATA of 2021 as  lodged by

the appellant namely Zafar Hussain son of Ghulam Hussain is allowed. The 
convictions and sentences of the appellant namely Zafar Hussain (the 
appellant in Criminal Appeal No.34-ATA of 2021) awarded by the learned 
trial court through the impugned judgment dated 16.01.2021 are hereby set-
aside. The appellant namely Zafar Hussain (the appellant in Criminal Appeal 
No.34-ATA of 2021) is ordered to be acquitted by extending him the benefit 
of the doubt. The appellant namely Zafar Hussain (the appellant in Criminal 
Appeal No.34-ATA of 2021) is in custody and is directed to be released 
forthwith if not required in any other case. 
 
29. 
Capital Sentence Reference No.02 of 2021 is answered in 
Affirmative and the sentence of death awarded to Khateeb Hussain son of 
Muhammad Hussain under section 302 (b) P.P.C. is Confirmed.
