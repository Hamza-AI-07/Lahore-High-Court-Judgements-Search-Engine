and Mr. Muhammad Asad Buttar, 
Advocates.

by: 
Mr. Muhammad Anwar Khan,

Advocate.  
 
Anwaar Hussain, J.  
Challenge has been laid to the 
appointment of respondent No.4, through impugned notification 
dated 24.11.2023, as Election Commissioner for holding and 
conducting election of the Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board 
(“PCB”) on the ground that respondent No.4, being a practising 
advocate, was obligated to get his licence suspended in terms of 
Rule 108-O of the Pakistan Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils 
Rules, 1976 (“the Rules”) to obtain his appointment as the Election 
Commissioner, which was not done, therefore, he cannot hold the 
said office. In addition, further challenge has been laid to the 
mandate given to respondent No.4 for composition of the Board of 
Governors (“BoG”) which, as per learned counsel for the petitioner 
falls within the purview of the functions assigned to the 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 80447/2023                                                                       2 
 
Management Committee in terms of Paragraph 10 of the 
Constitution of Pakistan Cricket Board (“the PCB Constitution”).  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that respondent 
No.4 is drawing salary to the tune of Rs.1 million per month 
alongwith other perks and privileges, which amounts to joining 
other service, therefore, Rule 108-O of the Rules is attracted. Adds 
that eligibility of respondent No.4 envisaged in terms of Paragraph 
29 of the PCB Constitution is not questioned, however, it has to be 
read with Rule 108-O of the Rules and unless he gets his licence to 
practice law suspended, respondent No.4 cannot be appointed as the 
Election Commissioner. Avers that power of ensuring proper 
composition of BoG is only vested with the Management 
Committee and therefore, the same cannot be taken away from its 
purview and assigned to respondent No.4, as the Election 
Commissioner, through the impugned notification.   
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.4, alongwith 
Legal Advisor of the PCB and learned Assistant Attorney General, 
submit that the case of respondent No.4 does not fall within the 
purview of Rule 108-O of the Rules inasmuch as he has not joined 
any other profession, business, service or vocation, rather, has only 
taken up temporary assignment as the Election Commissioner, for a 
period of three months only, with the specific role and function to 
hold transparent election for the Chairman of the Board and for 
composition of the BoG, within the said period.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record Perused.  
5. 
In the light of the above-mentioned facts as well as arguments 
of learned counsel for the parties, following questions have been put 
forth for the opinion of this Court:  
(i) 
Whether respondent No.4 was lawfully appointed as the 
 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 80447/2023                                                                       3 
 
 
Election Commissioner under the PCB Constitution and 
was required to get his license to practice law suspended 
before or after his appointment? 
(ii) 
Whether this Court can assume the functions and/or 
powers of a regulator such as the Bar Council in case of 
failure of respondent No.4 to get his license to practice law 
suspended?   
(iii) Whether the task assigned to respondent No.4 for the 
composition of the BoG violates the PCB Constitution and 
the powers of the Management Committee? 
6. 
The first two questions formulated hereinabove are inter-
linked. It is the case of the petitioner that respondent No. 4 was 
required to get his license to practice law suspended in order to be 
appointed and for continuation to hold office of the Election 
Commissioner. The qualifications of the Election Commissioner are 
defined in Paragraph 29(2) of the PCB Constitution, which reads as 
under:  
“(2) 
A person shall not be qualified to be appointed as Election 
Commissioner unless he is a former judge of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan or a High Court, or a person, qualified to be a judge of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan or the High Court or a person who has 
retired from government service in BS 22 or equivalent or above.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Before analysing the nub of the matter that relates to the 
qualifications of respondent No.4 in respect of appointment as the 
Election Commissioner, under the PCB Constitution, it is imperative 
to note that in terms of Paragraph 29(1) of the PCB Constitution, it 
is the Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan as Patron 
of the PCB who is competent authority to make the appointment. 
Paragraph 29(1) of the PCB Constitution reads as under:  
“29. 
Election Commissioner. – (1) There shall be an Election 
Commissioner of the Board appointed by the Patron, to discharge 
such functions as may be Prescribed.” 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 80447/2023                                                                       4 
 
Said power has been exercised through the impugned notification 
not only in case of respondent No.4 but in all earlier temporary 
appointments to the said office. This Court sees no irregularity in 
this regard in the impugned notification. Therefore, reliance placed 
on case reported as “Messrs Mustafa Impex, Karachi and others v. 
The Government of Pakistan through Secretary Finance, Islamabad 
and others” (PLD 2016 SC 808) by the petitioner side to contend 
that the patron had no authority is misplaced.  
7. 
Adverting to the qualifications to be appointed as the Election 
Commissioner under the PCB Constitution, it has been noted that 
the qualifications of a person to be appointed as Judge of a High 
Court or the Supreme Court of Pakistan, as the case may be, has 
been made basis for the qualification to be appointed as the Election 
Commissioner. The qualification of a Judge of a High Court and 
Supreme Court have been stipulated under Articles 193 and 177 of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the 
Constitution”) respectively. Perusal of the said provisions of the 
Constitution renders it succinctly clear that practice as an advocate 
for 10 years, inter alia, is condition precedent, in case of an 
advocate, to be qualified to be elevated as Judge of a High Court in 
terms of Article 193, whereas Article 177 of the Constitution 
envisages that a person who, inter alia, has an experience of 15 
years as practicing lawyer is eligible to be appointed as Judge of the 
Supreme Court. It is the existence of these qualifications which are 
required to become Judge of a High Court or the Supreme Court, as 
the case may be, and the suspension of the license to practice law 
would ipso facto eat away the eligibility to become the Judge of the 
said Courts and resultantly, eligibility to be appointed as the 
Election Commissioner, under the PCB Constitution. There is no 
denial that respondent No.4 possesses these qualifications. However, 
if the contentions of the petitioner are accepted, then respondent 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 80447/2023                                                                       5 
 
No.4 will have to get his licence suspended from the Bar Council 
concerned, before seeking temporary appointment of Election 
Commissioner for three months. The suspension of the license 
would thus ipso facto denude respondent No. 4 to be qualified to be 
appointed as the Election Commissioner. Therefore, the said 
interpretation as pleaded by the petitioner, will not only defeat the 
eligibility criteria envisaged under Paragraph 29 of the PCB 
Constitution but by its very nature and character, the argument of 
learned counsel for the petitioner is self-destructive.  
8. 
Even otherwise, admittedly, the petitioner has no exception as 
to the eligibility of respondent No. 4 to be appointed as the Election 
Commissioner rather only asserts that the respondent No. 4 is a 
practising advocate and has been carrying on his legal practice, after 
his appointment, whereas he is required to get his license suspended 
as his appointment as such amounts to joining some other business, 
service, profession or vocation in terms of Rule 108-O the Rules, 
which is reproduced hereunder: 
“108-0.  
An Advocate having his name on the Roll of a Bar 
Council shall apply to the later that his certificate be 
suspended because he intends to join some other 
profession, business, service or vocation: 
Provided that he may apply for restoration of his name 
on the roll of Advocates if he disassociates himself from 
such business, profession, service or vocation and 
provides an affidavit that he has not incurred any 
disqualification under the Legal Practitioners & Bar 
Councils Act, 1973 for enrolment as an Advocate during 
the period his certificate to practice remained suspended: 
Provided further that if he fails to seek such 
suspension within one month of such engagement or 
employment in such other profession or service he shall 
be guilty of professional misconduct under the Legal 
Practitioners & Bar Councils Act, 1973 and his name shall 
also be removed from the roll of Advocates.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Rule 108 provides that an advocate shall apply to the Bar Council 
concerned that his license may be suspended as he intends to join 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 80447/2023                                                                       6 
 
some other business, service, profession or vocation. It further lays 
down that failure to do so within a period of one month shall amount 
to professional misconduct under the Pakistan Legal Practitioners 
and Bar Councils Act, 1973 (“the Act, 1973”). Thus, it is clear that 
an advocate is required to get his licence suspended within a period 
of one month from date of said appointment and failure whereof 
may entail misconduct, if any. The petition is premature on this 
count alone as the said period has not elapsed yet. Even otherwise, 
proceedings on account of the misconduct is the power of the Bar 
Council concerned in terms of the provisions of the Act, 1973. 
When confronted, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that this 
Court is empowered to take cognizance of such misconduct. The 
argument is misconceived. Once it is abundantly clear that it is the 
Bar Council concerned that has been armed with the power to 
entertain and determine cases of misconduct, the constitutional 
jurisdiction cannot be exercised in a manner which amounts to 
usurpation and transgression into jurisdiction of the Regulators (i.e., 
Bar Council concerned).  Moreover, in such an eventuality, it is left 
to the Bar Council concerned to first determine as to whether 
respondent No.4 was required to get his license to practice law 
suspended or not, keeping in view the nature and duration of the 
assignment accepted by him as the Election Commissioner of the 
PCB.  
9. 
The matter can also be examined form another perspective. It 
is noted that the petitioner has filed this petition in the nature of quo 
warranto regarding respondent No.4 holding the office of the 
Election Commissioner under the PCB Constitution. The issue as to 
whether respondent No.4 was required to get the license to practice 
law suspended or not does not entail any bearing on the holding of 
the office of Election Commissioner, by respondent No.4, since the 
latter is admittedly qualified to be appointed to the said office. 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 80447/2023                                                                       7 
 
Rather, the issue is converse in nature as it is respondent No.4 
holding office of Election Commissioner which may or may not 
have any bearing on his status as the practicing advocate and his 
license issued by the respective Bar Council. This leaves no doubt in 
the opinion of this Court that the respondent No.4 validly holds the 
office of Election Commissioner under the PCB Constitution.  
10. 
Adverting to the third question as to the responsibility 
conferred upon respondent No.4 regarding the composition of the 
BoG, it will be advantageous to reproduce the mandate given to 
respondent No.4, through the impugned notification that reads as 
under: 
“2. 
The prime responsibility of the Election Commissioner, PCB 
shall be composition of BoG and the conduct of free and fair election 
of Chairman, PCB within the assigned period before 4th February, 
2024. He shall take all required measures for completion of the 
aforementioned assigned tasks.”  
It is the case of the petitioner that the Ministry of Inter-Provincial 
Coordination, Government of Pakistan, through notification dated 
04.11.2023, while exercising its power under Rule 16(j) of the Rules 
of Business, 1973 read with Paragraph 48 of the PCB Constitution 
extended the tenure of the Management Committee and assigned the 
task of finalizing the BoG and hence, the impugned notification 
contradicts the former notification. Notification dated 04.11.2023 
reads as under:  
“F.No.1-18/2018-IPC(S-II). In continuation of this Ministry’s 
Notification of even number dated 5th July, 2023, the Federal Cabinet 
vide Case No.610/Rule-19/2023/937 dated 4th November, 2023 has 
considered the extension of the tenure of the Management Committee, 
PCB in terms of Rule 16(j) of the Rules of Business, 1973 & Article 
48 of the PCB Constitution, 2014 and approved extension of (03) 
three months in tenure period of present Management Committee 
w.e.f. 5th November, 2023 with following stipulations:  
i. 
The Management Committee shall perform primary task of 
finalizing the BoG and conduct election of Chairman PCB at 
the earliest.  

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 80447/2023                                                                       8 
 
ii. 
The Management Committee shall perform day to day affairs 
of PCB only and shall not make any policy decisions or high 
level appointments.  
iii. 
The Management Committee shall not be granted extension 
beyond three months.

GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN” 
At this juncture, it would be advantageous to examine the 
composition of the BoG that has been provided under Paragraph 10 
of the Constitution of PCB, which reads as under:  
“10. 
Composition of Board of Governors. (1) There shall be a 
Board of Governors consisting of,- 
(a)

(c)

(d) 
two members to be nominated by the Patron in his discretion; 
and 
(e) 
Federal Secretary, Ministry of Inter Provincial Coordination, 
Government of Pakistan or any other officer nominated by 
him shall be an ex officio member and shall have the right to 
attend and speak at all meetings and otherwise take part in the 
proceedings of the Board of Governors, but shall not be 
entitled to vote, and for the first elections of the Board of

Writ Petition No. 80447/2023                                                                       9 
 
Organizations/Departments shall be from top four finishing 
teams of latest President's Trophy Tournament. 
(2) 
Where a member being representative of the Region, Service 
Organization, or Department completes his tenure or his office falls 
vacant for any reason whatsoever or if he is removed by the 
appointing authority, such representative shall cease to be a member 
of the Board of Governors forthwith and any replacement appointed 
by the relevant appointing authority shall only hold office for the 
remaining term of the removed member. 
(3) 
Any vacancy in the Board of Governors, for whatever reason, 
shall not prevent the holding of or invalidate the election of the 
Chairman. 
(4) The term of members of the Board of Governors shall be three 
years. 
(5) 
A member who fails to attend three or more consecutive 
meetings of the Board of Governors without a reasonable cause shall 
be liable to be removed by the Board of Governors and the resultant 
vacancy shall be filled as provided by or under the Constitution or by 
the Rules or Regulations: 
Provided that for the removal of such member, the procedure 
provided for in sub-paragraphs (6), (7), and (8) below, shall apply: 
Provided further that the member appointed under this sub-paragraph 
shall hold office for the residue term, which shall be treated as a full 
term. 
(6) 
The Chairman may, after recording reasons in writing, refer 
any complaint, relating to the misconduct of a member or failure of a 
member to attend three or more consecutive meetings of the Board of 
Governors, to an adjudicator out of the Panel of Adjudicators 
maintained by the Board under Part VI of this Constitution. 
(7) 
Any member, against whom a complaint is referred by the 
Chairman to the adjudicator, shall not be allowed to attend any 
meeting of the Board of Governors or any committee during the 
pendency of proceedings before the adjudicator. 
(8) 
In case the adjudicator, after holding such enquiry as he thinks 
proper, finds the said member guilty of the charge alleged in the 
complaint, the said member shall render himself liable to be removed 
from his office by the Board of Governors: 
Provided that the member proceeded against under this provision 
shall be entitled to a fair opportunity of hearing before the 
adjudicator: 
Provided further that if removed, the said member shall be ineligible 
to be appointed a member of the Board of Governors for a period of 
four years in the case of misconduct and for a period of two years in 
the case of failure to attend three or more consecutive meetings of the 
Board of Governors. 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 80447/2023                                                                       10 
 
(9) 
The Chief Operating Officer shall have the right to attend and 
speak at all meetings and otherwise take part in the proceedings of the 
Board of Governors but shall not be entitled to vote, 
(10) 
There shall be a Secretary of the Board of Governors 
appointed by the Board of Governors to record and maintain minutes 
of the meeting and to perform such other functions as may be 
assigned by the Chairman.” 
Perusal of Paragraph 10 of the PCB Constitution amply reveals that 
all the members of the BoG except the Chairman are either ex-
officio members and/or to be appointed from the service 
organization or department and/or by the Patron, as the case may be, 
and the Management Committee and/or the Election Commissioner 
has no direct role in it to play. However, the composition of the BoG 
is not complete till the election of the Chairman is held. Once the 
Chairman has been elected, only then the composition of the BoG 
becomes complete. Thus, the primary task assigned to respondent 
No.4 as the Election Commissioner by using the words 
“composition of BoG and the conduct of free and fair election of 
Chairman, PCB” clearly refers to the conduct of free and fair 
election of the Chairman of the PCB to complete the composition of 
the BoG. Therefore, no illegality or irregularity has been committed 
through impugned notification.  
11. 
For the foregoing reasons, this petition is devoid of any merits 
and hence, dismissed. No order as to costs.
