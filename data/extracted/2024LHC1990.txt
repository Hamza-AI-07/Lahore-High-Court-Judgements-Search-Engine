SULTAN

AHMAD, 
J:–In 
Constitution Petition No. 45436 of 2023  direction was given 
to the Secretary Ministry of Interior, Government of 
Pakistan, Islamabad to consider the case of the appellants and 
decide it in fair manners within 15 days. As a result thereof, 
request for removing names of the appellants from Passport 
Control List (PCL) was considered but the same was 
declined with the direction to retain the names of the 
appellants on PCL, vide order No. 12/230/2023-ECL dated 
17.10.2023. This order of the Secretary Ministry of Interior, 
Government of Pakistan, Islamabad was called into question 
through Constitution Petition No. 69901 of 2023, however, it 

 
Intra Court Appeal No. 71740 of 2023

could not find favour and the petition was dismissed vide 
order dated 23.10.2023, which has been assailed through the 
present Intra Court Appeal, filed under section 3(2) of the 
law Reform Ordinance, 1972 (the ‘Ordinance’). 
2.  
We have heard the arguments of the learned 
counsel for the parties and perused the record.  
3. 
In pursuance of order dated 06.11.2023, the Home 
Department / respondent No. 5 and Anti-Corruption 
Establishment / respondent No. 4 have filed reports. Home 
Department has referred to letter dated 26.06.2023 of Anti-
Corruption Establishment (the ‘Establishment’) and FIR No. 
11 / 2023 registered under sections 161, 162 and 34 of 
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 read with section 5(2) of the 
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 at Police Station DACE 
Punjab, Lahore (the ‘FIR’) lodged by the Establishment, 
against  Farhat Shahzadi alias Farrah Gogi, Usman Buzdar, 
Tahir Khursheed, Ahmad Aziz Tarar, Saleha Saeed, Usman 
Moazzam, Sohail Khawaja, Muhammad Asif and Ibrahim 
Maneka. Admittedly, the FIR is against the mother of the 
appellants and other accused persons. The appellants are not 
even nominated in the FIR. 
4. 
The Federal Government is vested with the powers 
to regulate the departure from and entry within Pakistan 
under rule 22 of the Passport Rules, 2021 (the ‘Passport 
Rules’). Sub rule 2 of the same requires the Division 
concerned and Directorate General of Immigration and 
Passport to maintain PCL for placement of names in category 
“A” & “B” with the following description:- 
(a)   under category ‘A‘, the names of those 
persons are placed who are involved in anti-
state activities or whose visit to foreign 

 
Intra Court Appeal No. 71740 of 2023 
 
 
3 
countries is considered to be prejudicial to the 
State interest, or, whose visit abroad is banned 
from security point of view. The names in this 
list shall be placed and removed by the 
Additional 
Secretary 
of 
the 
Division 
concerned; 
(b)  under category ‘B’, the names of those 
persons are placed who have been refused 
passport under these rules other than anti-
state activities specified in clause (a). The 
names of persons included in the category 
under this clause may also be placed on the 
recommendations of government agencies or 
departments; 
Category ‘A’ admits names of persons involved in anti-state 
activities. No allegation against the appellants for anti-state 
activities is leveled by the respondents. Under category ‘B’, 
list of the names of those who have been refused passport but 
not falling in category ‘A’ is to be maintained. It is not the 
case of the respondents that the appellants were ever refused 
passports under the Passport Rules. 
5. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in “The Federal 
Government through Secretary Interior, Government of 
Pakistan versus Ms. Ayyan Ali and others” (2017 SCMR 
1179) observed that liberty of a citizen cannot be curtailed on 
the basis mere registration of a criminal case. The following 
paragraph of the said judgment is highly relevant:- 
 
 
 “13. 
Reverting 
to 
the 
third 
Notification/Memorandum it is crucial to note 
that 
like 
the 
earlier 
two 
Notifications/Memorandums, 
the 
third 
Notification/Memorandum 
was 
issued 
purportedly for the reasons which do not 
conform to the criteria as laid down in the 
relevant rules and the exit control policy. It 
was not only in the case of Wajid Shamsul 
Hassan v. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary Ministry of Interior, Islamabad 

 
Intra Court Appeal No. 71740 of 2023 
 
 
4 
(PLD 1997 Lahore 617),   where it was held 
that the liberty of a citizen cannot be curtailed 
by mere registering a criminal case, and that 
mere registration of FIR would not be a 
ground for depriving a citizen of the exercise 
of his constitutional right and further that 
registration of a criminal case has no nexus 
with and is extraneous to the object of the Exit 
from Pakistan (Control) Ordinance 1981, but 
even in the case of respondent No.1, in relation 
to the second Notification/Memorandum, this 
Court, while dismissing the petitioner’s 
petition for leave, through judgment dated 
13.4.2016, has held as follows:- 
 
 
  
“5. 
Respondent No.1, no doubt, has 
been charged in a case mentioned above 
which is still pending adjudication in the 
competent Court of law. But mere 
pendency of a criminal case cannot 
furnish a justification for prohibiting her 
movement. It has never been the case of 
the petitioners that the respondent is 
involved in any of the cases listed in Rule 
2 of the Exit from Pakistan (Control) 
Rules, 2010 in general or Rule 2(1)(b) in 
particular, inasmuch as she has not been 
charged to have embezzled a large 
government’s 
fraud 
or 
committed 
institutional fraud.” 
However, 
as 
noted 
above 
the 
third 
Notification/Memorandum was issued on the 
ground 
clearly 
not 
falling 
within 
the 
parameters as prescribed by the relevant law, 
rules, 
and 
the 
above 
unequivocal 
pronouncement of this Court.” 
6. 
This Court in case titled “Sheikh Shan Ilahi versus 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Interior, Ministry 
of Interior, Islamabad and 6 others” (PLD 2023 Lahore 
359) held that the travel abroad though not expressly 
guaranteed by Article 15 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the ‘Constitution’) or the 
provision in Chapter 1, Part II but the Courts can invoke 

 
Intra Court Appeal No. 71740 of 2023 
 
 
5 
Articles 4 and 9 of the Constitution while dealing with such 
rights. The following extract will be beneficial to be 
reproduced:- 
“The right to travel abroad is not expressly 
guaranteed by Article 15 or any other 
provision in Chapter 1 of Part II of the 
Constitution but our courts have invoked 
Article 4 (right to be treated in accordance 
with law) and Article 9 (right to life and 
liberty) to support it. In Government of 
Pakistan and another v. Dada Amir Haider 
Khan (PLD 1987 SC 504) the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court held: 
“Article 15 guarantees to every citizen the 
right to remain in, enter and move freely 
throughout Pakistan. But his right to enter 
the country if he is leaving it or has gone 
abroad and his right to step out and step 
in the country are subject to reasonable 
restrictions imposed by law in the public 
interest. By reading the provisions of 
Articles 4, 9 and 15, it is manifest that 
every citizen has the liberty to go abroad 
and to re-enter Pakistan unless he is 
precluded from doing so under some law 
made in the public interest … Moreover, a 
citizen’s right to travel abroad is an 
important aspect of the citizen’s liberty 
and it closely related to the rights of free 
speech and association. As nations in the 
world 
become 
politically 
and 
commercially more dependent upon each 
other and foreign policy decisions have 
come to have greater impact upon the 
lives of citizens, the right to travel has 
become 
correspondingly 
more 
important.” 
7. 
In “Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif versus 
Federation of Pakistan and 4 others” (2019 P Cr. L J 1123), 
a learned Division Bench of this Court, while setting-aside an 
order placing name of an accused on ECL merely on the 
basis of pendency of an inquiry or investigation with 

 
Intra Court Appeal No. 71740 of 2023 
 
 
6 
National Accountability Bureau Authorities, has observed as 
follows:- 
“….Mere pendency of an inquiry with the 
“NAB” does not provide sufficient material or 
justification for keeping the name of the 
petitioner in the “ECL”. Apparently, no 
plausible reasons have been assigned by the 
respondents while placing the name of petitioner 
on “ECL”. It appears that the impugned order 
is passed in haste and in mechanical manner on 
the instructions of “NAB”. In recent past, there 
is a consistent view of this Court as well as 
learned High Courts of other provinces that 
mere pendency of an inquiry or investigation 
would be no ground for justifying the 
placement of name of an accused on “ECL”. It 
is well entrenched principle of law that merely 
pendency of an inquiry or investigation with 
the “NAB” Authorities, which seemed to be 
going on for a considerable long time, would 
not be a ground for depriving a citizen of his 
constitutional right of living as a free citizen of 
Pakistan. We see no reasonable ground on the 
basis of which petitioner could be deprived of 
travelling abroad. The view formed hereinabove 
is further fortified by a judgment of this Court in 
case “Sohail Latif and 2 others v. Federation of 
Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Interior 
Government of Pakistan, Islamabad and 2 
others” 
(PLD 
2008 
Lahore 
341). 
In 
“Muhammad Khyzer Yousuf Dada v. Federation 
of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of 
Interior and 5 others” (PLD 2011 Karachi 546) 
learned Sindh High Court, while dealing with 
the similar proposition, observed as under:- 
“Keeping in view the rationale laid down in the 
above reported cases, there is no material on 
record to show that there is any pending case 
against the petitioner in any Court and merely 
investigation by the NAB Authorities, which 
seems to be going on for a considerable time, 
will not be a ground for depriving the petitioner 
of his constitutional right of living as a free 
citizen of Pakistan and there appears to be no 
reasonable ground on the basis of which he

7 
could be deprived from travelling abroad.” 
   
 
 
    (Emphasis supplied) 
8. 
Similar view has been expressed by the learned 
Islamabad High Court in “Dr. Joseph Wilson versus 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Interior 
and others” (2017 P Cr. L J 1569) and the learned Court 
refused to construe the provisions of law as an open license 
to place any citizen’s name on ECL. Reference in this regard 
can also be made to the cases titled “Messrs United Bank Ltd. 
Versus Federation of Pakistan and others” (2014 CLD 544), 
“Farah Mazhar and 3 others versus Federation of Pakistan 
through Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Islamabad and 2 
others” (PLD 2022 Lahore 119), “Mrs. Ifrah Murtaza and 
another versus Government of Pakistan and others” (PLD 
2019 Lahore 565), “Hamid Khan through Authorized 
Attorney versus Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, 
Ministry of Interior, Islamabad and others” (2024 YLR 59), 
“Faisal Maqbool Shaikh versus Federation of Pakistan 
through Secretary Interior, Ministry of Interior, Islamabad 
and 02 others” (W.P. No. 2141 of 2023), “Dr. Shireen M. 
Mazari versus Federation of Pakistan through Secretary 
Interior, Ministry of Interior Islamabad and another” (W.P. 
No. 2212 of 2023), “Tabish Badar through Special Power of 
Attorney versus Pakistan, through Secretary, Ministry of 
Interior and 2 others” (2023 CLC 1457) and “Jaffar Khan 
vs. Federation of Pakistan, through Secretary, Ministry of 
Interior, Islamabad and 3 others” (PLD 2023 Balochistan 
65).

Respondent

refused 
to 
accept 
the 
representation of the appellants on account of ongoing 
investigation with the Establishment in the FIR, disclosing

possibility that Farhat Shahzadi has purchased properties in 
the name of her children from unlawful amounts. Order dated 
17.10.2023 reveals that to inquire into the same letters were 
written to different authorities for details of assets in the 
names of the appellants. Reading of the said order further 
reflects that representation of the appellants was rejected for 
the reason that Farhat Shahzadi and her husband have already 
left the Country to avoid consequence of the FIR and in the 
absence of appellants no source would be left with 
investigation team for further probe during the ongoing 
investigation. The same reason prevailed with the learned 
Judge-in-Chamber, who then observed as under:- 
“……The temporary stoppage in plans to leave 
Pakistan which will make the petitioners 
inaccessible to the investigating agencies does 
not appear, for now, to outweight the 
concerns/interest/duty of the state to uncover the 
facts qua alleged wrongs to public institutions. 
The instant constitutional petition under the 
circumstances does not appear to be based on 
good faith and seems to be rather indicative of a 
move to preclude facilitating fact-finding 
exercise of the investigating agencies……”  
11. 
In the above state of affairs that respondents’ request 
met with the approval by the learned Judge-in-Chamber. At 
the same time, expectation was shown by the learned Judge-
in-Chamber to expeditiously reach some point enabling the 
appellants to invoke the necessary machinery in changed 
circumstances for deletion of their names. Almost a year has 
passed since lodging of the FIR. The above observation was 
made by the learned Judge-in-Chamber on 23.10.2023. 
However, no progress is shown by the respondents. 
12. 
Today, fresh reports have been filed but once again 
same is the invocation. The reports filed before us repeatedly 

 
Intra Court Appeal No. 71740 of 2023 
 
 
9 
refer to the fact that Farhat Shahzadi has failed to join 
investigation and the learned Court of competent jurisdiction 
has declared her a proclaimed absconder. Admittedly, the 
FIR involves allegations of huge loss to Government 
Exchequer and Farhat Shahzadi has not joined the 
investigation but this alone cannot be a valid reason for 
placing names of present appellants on PCL for such a long 
time period and curtailing their rights, recognized in above 
discussed law. We have also noticed that the year of 
occurrence given in the FIR is 2019, when Eman Iqbal Jamil 
and Faraz Iqbal Jamil were less than sixteen years old. The 
learned Law Officers despite their earnest efforts have failed 
to convince to accede their request to retain the names of the 
appellants on PCL. 
14. 
For what has been discussed above, present appeal is 
allowed. Order dated 17.10.2023 passed by the learned 
Judge-in-Chamber is set-aside. No order as to costs.
