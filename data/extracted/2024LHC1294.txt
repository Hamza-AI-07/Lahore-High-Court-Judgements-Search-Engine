Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:-  Through this civil revision, 
the petitioners have challenged the validity of judgment & decree 
dated 05.03.2003 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 
Taunsa whereby the appeal of the respondents was accepted, the 
judgment & decree dated 20.04.2001 passed by the learned Civil 
Judge, Taunsa Sharif was set aside and the suit for declaration 
filed by the respondents was decreed.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that Muhammad Din, 
predecessor-in-interest of the respondents, filed a suit for 
declaration against the petitioners/defendants and contended that 
he was owner in possession of suit property fully described in the 
headnote of the plaint as well as owner in Shamlat and Shamlat 
of Caste Sikhani according to the proportionate of his own land in 
Moza Tubb. The respondent/ plaintiff sold land measuring 126 
Kanal 10 Marla through registered sale deed No.295 dated 
12.12.1960 to Abdullah s/o Mehmood, predecessor-in-interest of 
the petitioners/defendants, but he did not sell his share of Shamlat

of Caste Sikhani to him. The respondent/plaintiff remained in 
possession of Shamlat Caste Sikhani in Moza Tubb. During the 
consolidation proceedings, share of respondent/plaintiff in 
Shamlat 
Caste 
Sikhani 
was 
transferred 
to 
the 
petitioners/defendants alongwith the ownership of the land sold 
by him. The respondent/plaintiff contended that the transfer of 
Shamlat 
Caste 
Sikhani 
of 
Moza 
Tubb 
to 
the 
petitioners/defendants is illegal and liable to be reversed. The 
respondent/plaintiff further contended that the petitioners/ 
defendants alienated the suit land by different mutations within 
family which transactions are based on mala fide. The petitioners/ 
defendants filed contesting written statement. The trial Court 
framed issues, recorded pro and contra evidence of the parties 
and finally dismissed the suit vide judgment & decree dated 
20.04.2001. Being dejected, the respondents filed an appeal 
which was allowed vide judgment & decree dated 05.03.2003 by 
the appellate Court who by setting aside the judgment & decree 
dated 20.04.2001 passed by the trial Court, decreed the suit of the 
respondents. Hence, this civil revision. 
3. 
I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have 
gone through the record. 
4. 
In order to prove the asserted stance in the plaint 
Mehboob Ahmad has appeared as P.W.1, who stated that 
Muhammad Din his father was the owner of suit land and he has 
passed away; that the suit land is Shamlat of Caste Sikhani; that 
his grandfather sold 126 Kanal land to Abdullah; that during 
consolidation the said land was transferred to the defendants, 
whereas the plaintiffs are in possession of the suit land. During 
cross examination, he deposed that his grandfather sold land in 
the year 1961 but did not sold the share of Shamlat; that the land 
in Band Kucha is about 7-1/4 Kanal and the suit land is situated 

 
C.R.No.377-D/2003

in Moza Qom Sikhani Band Kocha; that his grandfather 
challenged the said consolidation proceedings through an appeal.  
5. 
Conversely, Noor Muhammad, one of the petitioners/ 
defendants has appeared as DW-1 and deposed that the suit land 
was purchased from Muhammad Din and later on consolidation 
proceedings were conducted and after the said proceedings, they 
filed appeal which was dismissed. During cross examination, he 
admitted it correct that the suit land is situated in Shamlat Qom 
Sikhani and they have not filed any appeal against consolidation 
proceedings as through said consolidation, the land of Shamlat 
came to their possession; that Ahmad Din filed appeal which was 
dismissed; that he did not know whether the Additional 
Commissioner in his order directed the plaintiff to approach Civil 
Court.  
6. 
The stance of the respondents/plaintiffs is that while 
alienating the land measuring 126 Kanal 10 Marla through 
registered sale deed No.295 dated 12.12.1960 their predecessor 
Ahmad Din had not transferred the land of Shamlat Caste Sikhani 
to the petitioners/defendants. Perusal of sale deed (Exh.P.3) 
executed by Muhammad Din in favour of Abdullah, predecessor-
in-interest of the petitioners/defendants, shows that he sold only 
his owned land and in the said instrument the alienation of 
Shamlat has nowhere been mentioned therein. The said sale deed 
(Ex.P3) was entered in the Revenue Record through a mutation 
Ex.P14 which also shows that only the owned land was 
transferred but the land of Shamlat Deh was not sold. The 
documents of sale deed Exh.P.13 and mutation Exh.P.16 does not 
show any entry of transfer of Shamlat land. The above Registered 

 
C.R.No.377-D/2003

cum official documents wear a legal presumption of correctness. 
It is settled law that a man can tell a lie but a document cannot.1 
7. 
As per Section 3 of West Pakistan Dispositions (Saving of 
Shamilat) Ordinance, 1959, Shamlat cannot be presumed as 
transferred unless specifically mentioned in the instrument of 
disposition. For ready reference, aforesaid provision is 
reproduced as under: 
 “3. Shamilat not included in disposition of land unless 
specifically 
mentioned 
as 
subject-matter 
of 
the 
disposition.—(1) Notwithstanding any law, usage or 
custom to the contrary, in any disposition of land, 
whether testamentary or otherwise, effected by the 
maker by means of a writing or orally and whether made 
before or after the commencement of this Ordinance, 
words or phrases of a general nature, purporting to 
convey rights or interests, incidental, contingent, or 
collateral, to that land, shall not be so construed as to 
include therein the Shamilat or any portion thereof 
appurtenant to such land, unless such Shamilat or a 
portion thereof has been specifically mentioned as the 
subject-matter of the disposition.” 
Under Para 7.19 of the Land Records Manual it is necessary to 
show in the mutation whether such transfer of land includes the 
shares of the Shamlat. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
Abdur Rauf Khan’s case2 has held that the possession follows title 
in such cases. In this case, the petitioners/defendants purchased 
only land but not the Shamlat. The Hon’ble Apex Court in Fazal 
Rahim’s3 case has held that in case at the time of selling of land 
without specifying Shamlat only the ownership of the land will 
be transferred and not the Shamlat. In Chiragh Shah’s case4 it has 
                                          
1 Abdul Ghani & Others. Vs. Mst. Yasmeen Khan & Others (2011 SCMR 837) and Saleem

C.R.No.377-D/2003

been held that Shamlat will not be presumed to be alienated if it 
has not specifically been mentioned in the registered sale deed.  
8. 
So far as arguments of learned counsel for the petitioners/ 
defendants that the suit was hopelessly time barred and the suit 
land/Shamlat was given to the petitioners/defendants during 
consolidation proceedings and civil court has no jurisdiction, 
suffice it to say that the Consolidation Authorities, in appeal and 
revision, categorically advised the respondent/plaintiff to 
approach Civil Court for correction of entries in the revenue 
record and every new entry in revenue record creates fresh cause 
of action and in this case recurring cause of action is available to 
the respondents/plaintiffs. Further, the respondents/plaintiffs are 
in possession of the suit land as such the suit is well within time 
and the Civil Court has rightly adjudicated the matter.5 Thus, the 
above arguments of learned counsel for the petitioners/defendants 
is without any force and the same are hereby repelled. 
9.  
The trial court has failed to appreciate the legal and 
factual aspects of the case and dismissed the suit of the 
respondents/plaintiffs 
whereas 
the 
appellate 
court, 
after 
discussing the facts as well as evidence of the parties, through a 
well-reasoned judgment & decree has rightly allowed the appeal 
of the respondent and decreed their suit as prayed for. It is well 
settled law that in the event of conflict of judgments, findings of 
appellate Court are to be preferred and respected, unless it is 
shown from the record that such findings are not supported by 
evidence.6

In view of above, this civil revision being devoid of any 
merit is hereby dismissed. No order as to costs.
