Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Through this petition under Article 
199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973  
(the “Constitution”), the Petitioner seeks recovery of his minor children from 
the custody of their mother (Respondent No.1), who has allegedly abducted 
them from Canada and unlawfully brought them to Lahore, Pakistan. 
The factual background 
2. 
 
The Petitioner and Respondent No.1 (the “Parties”) are 
Pakistani citizens. On 15.05.2005, they married in the United Arab Emirates 
(UAE), and had three children, all sons, namely Zoran Syed Hassan  
(aged 13), Zarayb Syed Hassan (aged 10), and Zaviyar Syed Hassan  
(aged 8). All of them were born and raised in the UAE. The family resided 
in the UAE until March 2020, when Respondent No.1 went on a trip to 
England and was stuck there for three months due to the pandemic 
restrictions preventing her from returning to the UAE. During these three 
months, the children were in the Petitioner‟s care in the UAE. 
3. 
 
The Petitioner was permitted to immigrate to Canada with his 
family in 2019. They “landed” in Canada as Permanent Residents in May 
2020 but had not yet determined a timeline for a move.

4. 
 
In June 2020, the Petitioner and the three children visited 
relatives in New Jersey for a month while Respondent No.1 went to 
England. They all returned to the UAE in June/July 2020 and lived together 
until November 2020. In the said month, the Petitioner moved to Canada 
alone, obtaining residence and employment in Toronto. Respondent No.1 
and the children remained in the UAE. 
5. 
 
In June 2021, the Parties discussed the children visiting the 
Petitioner in Canada. In a text exchange, Respondent No.1 insisted that the 
Petitioner purchase return tickets for the children. The Petitioner had 
suggested one-way tickets to circumvent the prohibition against non-
essential travel, saying he would buy the children‟s tickets back to UAE 
after they arrived. The Petitioner ended up purchasing return tickets as 
Respondent No.1 had requested. Respondent No.1 sent the two older 
children to Canada (as unaccompanied minors) to visit the Petitioner on 
23.07.2021. Their return flight was on 22.08.2021. The Petitioner did not 
return 
those 
boys. 
Instead, 
he 
enrolled 
them 
in 
a 
school  
(Jean Lumb Public School) to start in September 2021. 
6. 
 
On 19.04.2021, Respondent No.1, through her Special 
Attorney, Muhammad Yaqoob son of Siraj Din (Respondent No.2), filed an 
application under section 7 of the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 (GWA) in 
the Family Court at Lahore (Guardian Case No.2571/G.C./2021) for her 
appointment as the guardian of the children. She inter alia asserted that she 
resided in Lahore and all three children were in her custody. On 13.07.2021, 
the Petitioner was proceeded ex parte, and the case was scheduled for the 
evidence of Respondent No.1. On 02.10.2021, the Family Court directed 
Respondent No.1 to appear in person and also produce the children. On 
19.11.2021, Respondent No.2, Muhammad Yaqoob, presented three boys in 
the Family Court, claiming they were Zoran, Zarayb, and Zaviyar. The court 
photographed these children and superimposed the pictures on the Order 
Sheet. However, the Petitioner contends that Zoran and Zarayb were with 
him in Canada during this time, and that the boys produced before the 
Family Court were not his sons. 
7. 
 
Respondent No.1 appeared before the Family Court as AW-1 
and recorded her statement during the above-mentioned proceedings. She 
inter alia deposed that she resided in Lahore and all three children were in 

Writ Petition No.78185/2023

her custody. She submitted a copy of the decree as Mark-A to Mark-C and a 
Divorce Certificate dated 26.04.2021 as Mark-B. On 25.11.2021, Murtaza 
Ashraf Khan appeared before the Family Court as AW-2 and recorded a 
statement supporting Respondent No.1. The Family Court accepted the 
above-mentioned application of Respondent No.1 and issued her Guardian 
Certificate subject to the condition that she shall not take minors beyond its 
jurisdiction without prior permission except for occasional visits.  
8. 
 
On 01.12.2021, Respondent No.1 submitted an application to 
the Family Court seeking permission to take the children abroad. On 
06.12.2021, she produced three boys in court, asserting that they were the 
children she referred to in her application. The court documented this by 
capturing her image with the boys and pasting it on the Order Sheet. The 
Petitioner alleges that Zoran and Zarayab were misrepresented as they were 
in Canada during that time. In these proceedings, Respondent No.1 testified 
as AW-1 and provided her statement under oath supporting her application. 
Respondent No.2 (Muhammad Yaqoob) appeared as AW-2 and testified in 
favour of Respondent No.1. The Family Court accepted the application of 
Respondent No.1 through an order dated 24.12.2021, permitting her to take 
the minors abroad contingent upon the submission of surety bonds worth 
Rs.30,00,000/-. Additionally, she was obligated to produce the minors 
before the court whenever required.  
9. 
 
On 31.01.2022, Respondent No.1 signed a permanent 
employment contract with Triple-M Professional Corp. in Toronto and made 
plans to reside with her cousin in Milton, Ontario. Shortly thereafter, she 
arrived in Canada with the youngest child, Zaviyar. On 05.02.2022, she 
went to the Petitioner‟s residence while he was not home and took the two 
older children to reside with her and the youngest child in Milton. 
Subsequently, Respondent No.1 registered all three children for school in 
Milton. They started on 14.02.2022 in Grades 6, 3 and 1, respectively. 
10. 
 
In 2022, the Petitioner and Respondent No.1 applied to the 
Ontario Court of Justice (the “Ontario Court”) for an order that the children 
primarily reside with them. They admitted that (a) they and the children had 
legal status as Permanent Residents in Canada, (b) they both had permanent 
employment in Toronto, and (c) the children‟s habitual residence was in 
Ontario.

11. 
 
The Petitioner filed an urgent motion in the Ontario Court, 
which was heard on 18.02.2022. Both parties expressed their intention to 
remain in Ontario with their children. Respondent No.1 clarified that she 
was not seeking recognition of Pakistan‟s Family Court order at the 
moment. Given this context, the Ontario Court determined that it needed to 
address only the issues of primary residence and parenting time. It directed 
Respondent No.1 to return the two older children to the Petitioner‟s care and 
asked the latter to re-enroll them at Jean Lumb Public School immediately. 
It ordered that “on a temporary, without prejudice basis,” the above two 
older children would primarily reside with the Petitioner (father) and that the 
youngest child would primarily reside with Respondent No.1 (mother). The 
court ordered that the children would spend the first weekend of each month 
with the Petitioner and that Respondent No.1 would have parenting time 
with the three children on all the other weekends. It further directed that 
neither party shall change the children‟s school or remove them from 
Ontario without its permission. 
12. 
 
Respondent No.1 brought the three children to Pakistan on 
16.11.2023. The Petitioner filed an urgent motion in the Ontario Court, 
which was heard on November 20 and 21, 2023. The court directed the 
following actions under sections 28(1), 36(4), and 36(5) of the Children‟s 
Law Reform Act (CLRA): Firstly, the mother (Respondent No.1) was 
ordered to immediately return the children to their habitual residence in 
Toronto, Ontario, at her own expense, with the father (the Petitioner) 
holding all the children‟s passports and government-issued documents until 
further notice. Secondly, upon their return to Ontario, on a temporary basis, 
the children were to reside solely with the father, while the mother shall 
have liberal access at his discretion. The father was granted sole decision-
making responsibility regarding the children. Thirdly, the court mandated 
that, upon request and receipt of the court order, Ontario police forces were 
obligated to locate, apprehend, and deliver the children to the father. 
Fourthly, the International Police Organization (INTERPOL) was asked to 
enforce the court‟s orders and ensure the children‟s return to their habitual 
residence in Toronto. 
13. 
 
The Petitioner has filed this constitutional petition for the 
implementation of the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International 

Writ Petition No.78185/2023 
 
 
 
- 5 - 
Child Abduction 1980 (the “Hague Convention”). He seeks a writ of habeas 
corpus directing Respondent No.6 (Inspector General of Police, Punjab) to 
recover the children and their travel documents from the unlawful custody 
of Respondent No.1 and produce them before this Court. He has further 
prayed that the children may be handed over to him to be taken to Canada 
and submitted before the jurisdiction of their home court. Lastly, he has 
prayed that Respondent No.1 and her special attorney, Respondent No.2, be 
prosecuted for fraudulently obtaining custody orders despite the children 
being in Canada with him. 
The submissions 
14. 
 
The Petitioner‟s counsel, Mr. Irfan Sadiq Tarar, Advocate, 
contends that the children‟s habitual residence is in Canada. The Ontario 
Court had restrained the Parties from removing the children from its 
jurisdiction without prior permission. Respondent No.1 violated that order 
and unlawfully brought the children to Lahore. According to Mr. Tarar, it 
amounts to international parental child abduction under the Hague 
Convention. Pakistan is a signatory to that Convention, so the children are 
liable to be repatriated to Canada forthwith. The counsel argues that the 
children‟s custody with Respondent No.1 is illegal, or at least improper, and 
this Court is competent to issue a writ of habeas corpus under Article 199 of 
the Constitution to recover them and pass orders as the Petitioner has prayed 
for in the present petition. 
15. 
 
Advocate Ch. Akbar Ali Shad, the counsel for Respondents  
No. 1 & 2, contends that the Hague Convention does not apply to the present 
case. Pakistan and Canada are signatories to the Hague Convention, but it is 
not in effect between the two countries because they have not accepted each 
other‟s ascension. The Parties are Pakistani nationals, so all matters relating 
to the custody of the children, parental time, and visitation arrangements 
have to be decided by the Family Court in accordance with the GWA, under 
which the welfare of the minors is the paramount consideration. 
16. 
 
Mr. Shad has also objected to the maintainability of this 
petition. He argues that the High Court‟s constitutional jurisdiction for 
minors‟ recovery can be invoked in exceptional circumstances. There are 
none in the present case. Hence, the Family Court is the proper forum for 
resolving the dispute between the Parties. He further submits that 

Writ Petition No.78185/2023 
 
 
 
- 6 - 
Respondent No.1 applied under section 7 of the GWA, and the Family Court 
appointed her the children‟s guardian vide order dated 25.11.2021 and 
issued her Guardian Certificate. The Petitioner has challenged that certificate 
under section 12(2) CPC. Respondent No.1 has filed a reply thereto and is 
contesting it. The Family Court has framed issues on that application and 
directed the Parties to produce evidence to substantiate their respective 
assertions. Mr. Shad argues that the Petitioner, having elected to seek a 
remedy before the Family Court, is excluded under the doctrine of election 
of remedies to file the present constitutional petition. 
17. 
 
In rebuttal, Mr. Tarar has argued that the children had all along 
been with the Petitioner in Canada at all material times. Respondent No.1 
got the Guardian Certificate dated 25.11.2021 through deceit and fraud. 
Upon knowledge, the Petitioner challenged the said Guardian Certificate by 
filing an application under section 12(2) CPC before the Family Court which 
suspended its operation vide order dated 23.04.2022. The counsel contends 
that Respondent No.1‟s conduct and the manner in which she has abused the 
legal process constitute extraordinary circumstances. Therefore, this 
constitutional petition should proceed. 
18. 
 
Mr. Sittar Sahil, Assistant Advocate General, adversely 
commented on the conduct of Respondent No.1 while referring to different 
documents available on the file. He states that the question as to whether 
Respondent No.1 played foul with the Family Court in Pakistan must be 
thoroughly investigated and taken to its logical end. However, Mr. Sahil also 
opines that the Petitioner‟s remedy lies with the Family Court – where the 
matter is already pending – and that this petition is not maintainable. 
The law 
19. 
 
The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is the 
most comprehensive international instrument safeguarding children‟s rights 
across all facets of their lives. At its core lies Article 3, which asserts that the 
best interests of the child must be the paramount consideration in all matters 
concerning them. This provision obligates States to ensure the protection and 
well-being of children under all circumstances, serving as a fundamental 
principle guiding policy and practice globally. What is in the child‟s best 

Writ Petition No.78185/2023 
 
 
 
- 7 - 
interests is a matter of fact that has to be determined in light of all the 
relevant circumstances.1 
20. 
 
In General Comment No.14 (2013),2 the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child3 (the “CRC Committee”) has stated that the concept of 
“best interests of the child” has three dimensions: (a) a substantive right,  
(b) a fundamental interpretative legal principle, and (c) a rule of procedure. 
The “substantive right” entitles the child to have their best interests assessed 
and prioritized whenever decisions affecting them are made. This right 
imposes an inherent obligation on States to ensure its implementation, which 
can be invoked directly before a court. As a “fundamental interpretative 
legal principle”, the concept mandates that if a legal provision is open to 
more than one interpretation, the construction which most effectively serves 
the child‟s best interests should be chosen, guided by the rights enshrined in 
the Convention and its Optional Protocols. As a “rule of procedure”, it 
requires that whenever a decision is to be made that will affect a specific 
child, an identified group of children, or children in general, the decision-
making process must include an evaluation of the possible impact  
(positive or negative) of the decision on the child or children concerned. 
Assessing and determining the best interests of the child requires procedural 
guarantees. 
21. 
 
In custody disputes, the concept of the child‟s best interests 
prioritizes the child‟s welfare and well-being above the parents‟ interests. It 
requires a thorough assessment of various factors, including their physical, 
emotional, and psychological welfare and their cultural, social, and 
educational needs. It emphasizes that subject to their age and maturity, the 
child‟s opinions and preferences should be given due consideration when 
determining custody arrangements, ensuring their active participation in 
decision-making. Furthermore, decisions must not discriminate against the 
child based on factors such as gender, race, or disability. Instead, they 
should provide a safe, stable, and nurturing environment conducive to the 
child‟s growth and long-term happiness.

Although the CRC touches upon various aspects of child 
abduction in several Articles, its treatment of this issue remains indirect and 
general. For example, Article 9(1) requires States Parties to ensure that 
children are not separated from their parents against their will, except when 
competent authorities, subject to judicial review, determine that such 
separation is necessary for their best interests. This determination may arise 
in cases of parental abuse or neglect or when parents live separately and 
decisions about the child‟s residence are necessary. Article 10(1) directs 
States Parties to handle applications for family reunification positively and 
promptly, without adverse consequences for the applicants or their families. 
Article 10(2) affirms the right of children with parents in different countries 
to maintain regular contact with both parents, except in exceptional 
circumstances. It also stresses that States Parties must respect the child and 
their parents‟ freedom to leave and enter any country, subject only to 
restrictions necessary for national security, public order, public health, 
morals, or the rights and freedoms of others, consistent with the CRC. 
Article 11 mandates that States Parties combat the illicit transfer and non-
return of children abroad through bilateral or multilateral agreements or 
accession to the existing ones. Despite these provisions, the CRC lacks 
detailed 
procedural 
mechanisms 
to 
address 
child 
abduction 
comprehensively. Hence, there was a need for a supplementary international 
treaty. The Hague Convention, adopted on October 25, 1980, fills this void. 
23. 
 
The Hague Convention seeks to prevent the unlawful removal 
or retention of children across international borders by their parents, thus 
shielding them from the harmful consequences of abduction. It aims to  
(a) secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in 
any Contracting State, and (b) to ensure that rights of custody and access 
under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in the other 
Contracting States. Additionally, the Convention aims to prevent forum 
shopping by establishing uniform procedures for resolving abduction cases 
and addressing human rights concerns related to the rights of children and 
parents. 
24. 
 
Article 38 of the Hague Convention stipulates that any State 
may accede to the Convention. However, the accession will have effect only 
as regards the relations between the acceding State and those Contracting 

Writ Petition No.78185/2023 
 
 
 
- 9 - 
States that have accepted the accession. Article 39 further provides that any 
State may, at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance, approval, or 
accession, declare the extension of the Convention to all territories for which 
it holds international responsibilities or select specific territories. In other 
words, when a country accedes to the Convention, it does not automatically 
form a partnership with all the countries that have ratified or acceded to it. 
Instead, countries must accept another country‟s accession to the Convention 
according to the conditions described in the Convention before a binding 
treaty comes into being.  
25. 
 
The Hague Convention adopts a proactive and remedial 
approach. Its focus is not to adjudicate the merits of custody disputes but 
rather to address the breach of rights of custody established by law in the 
child‟s habitual residence. The underlying principle is that the most 
appropriate jurisdiction for custody disputes is typically the child‟s habitual 
residence before the abduction. This ensures that long-term decisions 
regarding their upbringing are made in the environment most familiar to 
them and by a court having access to the most relevant information. In 
Office of the Children’s Lawyer v. Balev, 2018 SCC 16, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 
398, McLachlin C.J. of the Supreme Court of Canada noted that swift return 
serves three purposes. Firstly, it shields against the detrimental consequences 
of wrongful removal or retention. Secondly, it discourages parents from 
taking the child away with the expectation of building ties in a new country 
that could potentially result in custody being awarded to them. Lastly, 
prompt return aims to expedite the assessment of the merits of a custody or 
access dispute in the child‟s habitual residence, thereby eliminating disputes 
over the appropriate jurisdiction for resolving them. 
26. 
 
In re J (a child) (FC), [2005] UKHL 40, Baroness Hale of 
Richmond stated that the Hague Convention is motivated by the belief that 
resolving disputes about children‟s future is best done in their home 
countries. It aims to prevent one parent from relocating a child to gain an 
advantage in custody battles or to evade court orders. Rather than directly 
settling disputes, the Convention mandates returning the child to their home 
country or enforcing the original court order, with few exceptions. While 
this may occasionally not align with the individual child‟s best interests, the 
States that became parties to these treaties accepted this disadvantage to 

Writ Petition No.78185/2023 
 
 
 
- 10 -
some individual children for the sake of the greater advantage to children in 
general. This arrangement deters parents from moving their children across 
borders without consent. Additionally, it establishes a system of reciprocal 
obligations among participating States, whereby those adhering to the 
Convention can expect similar cooperation in return. 
27. 
 
Pakistan ratified the CRC on November 12, 1990,4 and acceded 
to the Hague Convention on December 22, 2016.5 In view of Article 38 of 
the Hague Convention referred to above, the effectiveness of the Convention 
is contingent upon mutual acceptance of accession among the participating 
countries. Therefore, courts in Pakistan must differentiate between 
Convention and non-Convention cases when dealing with international child 
abduction cases. 
Convention cases 
28. 
 
The Hague Convention adopts a unique approach to the 
violation of custody rights, departing from traditional rules governing 
jurisdiction and the recognition of foreign judgments by introducing the 
principle of status quo ante.6 According to Article 4, the Convention applies 
to any child who was habitually resident in a Contracting State immediately 
before any breach of custody or access rights. The Convention ceases to 
apply when the child attains the age of 16 years. 
29. 
 
Articles 12 and 13 of the Hague Convention deal with the 
conditions under which a child wrongfully removed or retained should be 
returned to their habitual residence. Article 12 stipulates that if a child is 
wrongfully removed or retained, as defined in Article 3, and legal 
proceedings for their return commence within one year of the occurrence, 
the authorities in the State where the child is situated must promptly return 
the child. If proceedings are initiated after one year has elapsed, the child‟s 
return can still be ordered unless it is shown that he has adjusted in his new 
environment. Where the judicial or administrative authority in the  
                                          
4 Upon ratification, Pakistan initially entered reservations to two articles of the CRC. However, these 
reservations were later withdrawn on July 23, 1997. 
5 This was subject to certain reservations in relation to Articles 24 and 26 which still exist. The Hague 
Convention became effective for Pakistan on 01.03.2017.

requested State has reason to believe that the child has been taken to another 
State, it may stay the proceedings or dismiss the application for their return. 
30. 
 
Article 13 provides three additional grounds for the judicial or 
administrative authority not to order the child‟s return. These are: (a) the 
person, institution, or other body having the care of the person of the child 
was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or 
retention, or had consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal or 
retention; or (b) there is a grave risk that the child‟s return would expose 
them to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place them in an 
intolerable situation; or (c) the child objects to being returned and has 
attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take 
account of their views. In considering the three grounds provided in Article 
13, the interests of the child must be considered alongside the fundamental 
purpose of the Hague Convention, which aims to ensure that children 
wrongfully removed from their place of habitual residence are returned there 
as soon as possible. 
31. 
 
The determination of habitual residence is crucial in cases 
involving international child abduction because, as discussed above, it has a 
direct link with the question of child‟s welfare. Hence, it has been the 
subject of extensive judicial interpretation. The Court of Justice of the 
European Union has also considered this concept in The proceedings 
brought by A (Case C-523/07)[2010] Fam 42. It held that it “must be 
interpreted as meaning that it corresponds to the place which reflects some 
degree of integration by the child in a social and family environment. To that 
end, in particular, the duration, regularity, conditions, and reasons for the 
stay on the territory of a member State and the family‟s move to that State, 
the child‟s nationality, the place and conditions of attendance at school, 
linguistic knowledge, and the family and social relationships of the child in 
that State must be taken into consideration. It is for the national court to 
establish the child‟s habitual residence, taking account of all the 
circumstances specific to each case.” The European Court made similar 
observations in Mercredi v. Chaffe (Case C-497/10 PPU)[2012] Fam 22. 
32. 
 
In re A (Children) (AP) [2013] UKSC 60, Baroness Hale ruled 
that habitual residence is a question of fact and not a legal concept such as 
domicile. There is no legal rule akin to that a child automatically takes the 

Writ Petition No.78185/2023 
 
 
 
- 12 -
domicile of his parents. The test adopted by the European Court is  
“the place which reflects some degree of integration by the child in a social 
and family environment” in the country concerned. This depends on 
numerous factors influencing the family‟s stay in the country. Baroness Hale 
held that the test adopted by the European Court should be preferred, being 
focused on the child‟s situation, with the parents‟ purposes and intentions 
being merely one of the relevant factors. An infant or young child‟s social 
and family environment is shared with those (whether parents or others) 
upon whom he is dependent. Hence, it is necessary to assess the integration 
of that person or persons in the social and family environment of the country 
concerned. 
33. 
 
In Office of the Children’s Lawyer v. Balev, 2018 SCC 16, 
[2018] 1 S.C.R. 398, McLachlin C.J. of the Supreme Court of Canada 
emphasized that determining habitual residence goes beyond merely 
identifying the child‟s last residence and duration there. While crucial, other 
factors, such as assessing all relevant links and circumstances, also matter. 
This involves examining the child‟s nationality, movements between 
countries, ties to each country, duration, regularity, conditions, and reasons 
for the child‟s stay in a particular place. No single factor dominates the 
analysis, and the judge should consider all circumstances. The child‟s age is 
relevant; for infants, their environment is mainly determined by their 
caregivers. Parents‟ intentions, particularly for infants or young children, 
may be significant, although not conclusive. 
34. 
 
The presumption favouring habitual residence jurisdiction must 
yield to the necessity of safeguarding a child in cases of serious harm. The 
burden of proof is on the person alleging it. Furthermore, serious harm is 
established only when the harm itself is substantial. Thus, simply showing 
potential adverse effects on the child upon return is not enough. Instead, the 
assessment focuses on the likelihood and severity of such harm. 
35. 
 
Pakistan is a federation whose Constitution vests the subject of 
family and children in the provinces. To implement the Hague Convention 
effectively, they have included it in the Schedule of the West Pakistan 

Writ Petition No.78185/2023 
 
 
 
- 13 -
Family Courts Act 1964 as Entry 6A.7 Consequently, Family Courts dealing 
with cases under section 25 of the GWA now have jurisdiction over 
international child abduction disputes, encompassing custody issues, orders 
from foreign courts, and judgments from countries that are parties to the 
Hague Convention.8 
36. 
 
Neither the Family Courts Act nor GWA provides specific 
guidelines for adjudicating Convention cases. Perhaps it was deemed 
unnecessary. Since the aforementioned amendment has incorporated the 
Hague Convention into the Family Courts Act, courts may benefit from the 
jurisprudence discussed above unless it is inconsistent with our judicial

The case McKee v McKee, [1951] AC 352, has had a lasting 
impact on the development of family law, especially in international disputes 
involving child custody. In this case, the core issue was a custody dispute 
that crossed international borders. It originated from a familial conflict 
between Mr. and Mrs. McKee, who were residents of Ontario, Canada. After 
their marriage in 1942 and the birth of their son in 1943, Mrs. McKee left for 
England with the child in 1946 without her husband‟s consent. In England, 
she secured a custody order in 1948. Meanwhile, Mr. McKee successfully 
challenged this in Ontario, obtaining a custody order in his favour in 1949, 
which the Ontario Court of Appeal confirmed. The case reached the Privy 
Council, which upheld the Ontario court‟s decision, emphasizing that the 
child‟s welfare was paramount and should be assessed by his domicile of 
origin, Ontario. This case underscored the importance of jurisdiction based 
on domicile in international child custody disputes and reinforced the 
principle that child welfare supersedes all other considerations, including 
recognizing foreign custody orders. The Privy Council ruled that the order of 
a foreign court would yield to the welfare and happiness of the child. The 
comity of the courts demanded not its enforcement but its grave 
consideration. It further stated:

“It is possible that a case might arise in which it appeared to a court, 
before which the question of custody of an infant came, that it was in the 
best interests of that infant that it should not look beyond the 
circumstances in which its jurisdiction was invoked and for that reason 
give effect to the foreign judgment without further inquiry. It is, however, 
the negation of the proposition … that the infant‟s welfare is the 
paramount consideration, to say that where the learned trial judge has in 
his discretion thought fit not to take the drastic course above indicated, but 
to examine all the circumstances and form an independent judgment, his 
decision ought for that reason to be overruled. Once it is conceded that the 
court of Ontario had jurisdiction to entertain the question of custody and 
that it need not blindly follow an order made by a foreign court, the 
consequence cannot be escaped that it must form an independent judgment 
on the question, although in doing so it will give proper weight to the 
foreign judgment. What is the proper weight will depend on the 
circumstances of each case.”

When a child is taken to a country where the Hague Convention 
does not apply, the law of that country governs custody determinations. The 
court will often consider the child‟s best interest when determining custody, 
but each country has a different definition of this term.9 Some countries, 
such as Canada,10 have a complete code for cases not covered by the Hague 
Convention. On the other hand, several nations have regard for its guiding 
principles even when they lack direct applicability.

In re Barrios and Sanchez [(1989) FLC 77,602], a father 
abducted the two children of his marriage from Chile, which at the time was 
not a party to the Hague Convention, to Australia which was a party to it. 
The Court of First Instance ordered the father to return the child to the 
mother‟s custody in Chile. On appeal against that order, the Full Family 
Court of Australia said: 
“Although His Honour was correct in saying that the Convention had no 
direct application to this case in the strict sense, we think that it is 
nevertheless open to a court, and appropriate in this case, to pay regard to 
the policy of the Convention, particularly having regard to the fact that 
Australia is a party to it.”

In Lehartel v Lehartel, [1993] 1 NZLR 578, the child was the 
subject of a joint custody order between the father and mother made by a 
Court in Tahiti where the child and his parents were residing. The mother 
then took the child from Tahiti, which was a non-Convention country, to 
New Zealand, a Convention country, and failed to return the child to Tahiti. 
The father went to New Zealand and sought a court order to return the child 
to Tahiti. The New Zealand Guardianship Amendment Act 1991, which

implements the Hague Convention in New Zealand, did not apply. 
Tompkins J. in the High Court of New Zealand held that the child should be 
returned by the mother to Tahiti and stated on p. 583: 
“Although the Amendment Act and the Convention do not directly apply 
to this case, I consider that the court can properly have regard to principles 
of the Convention as a factor to take into account in deciding how the 
court should exercise its discretion on the application before it. This 
approach accords with that of the Full Court of the Family Court of 
Australia In the marriage of Barrios and Sanchez [(1989) FLC 77,602]. 
That was an appeal against an order requiring the father to return two 
children of the marriage to the custody of the mother in Chile. The 
Convention did not apply because Chile was not a signatory. The Full 
Court considered that although the Convention had no direct application, it 
was open to the court and appropriate, in that case, to pay regard to the 
policy of the Convention, particularly having regard to the fact that 
Australia was a party to it.” 
41. 
 
In the U.K., the Chancery judges developed the principle that 
the individual child‟s welfare might outweigh any other considerations in 
exercising their inherent jurisdiction over children. The Guardianship of 
Infants Act 1925 casts a statutory duty on the courts to regard the child‟s 
welfare as their paramount consideration.11 Despite this overarching 
principle, there are instances where the application of the welfare principle 
may be specifically excluded by statute. For example, the Child Abduction 
and Custody Act 1985 sometimes excludes the welfare principle, aligning 
with international treaties like the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of 
International Child Abduction and the European Convention on Recognition 
and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children. 
42. 
 
In the era following the Hague Convention, English courts have 
examined the principles governing applications for returning children 
abducted from non-Convention countries in a series of legal cases.  
In re M (Abduction: Non-Convention Country) [1995] 1 FLR 89, the Court 
of Appeal outlined key principles guiding English courts in non-Convention 
cases. It ruled that the best interests of children should be prioritized, adding 
that they are usually best secured by having their future determined in the 
jurisdiction of their habitual residence and sparing them the distress and 
disruption they are liable to suffer if one parent abducts them from the home 
jurisdiction to secure a tactical or a supposed juridical advantage in a 
competing jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the court should consider all relevant 
                                          
11 The statutory duty was first laid down by section 1 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1925 and later 
consolidated in section 1 of the Guardianship of Minors Act 1971.

factors delineated in Article 13 of the Hague Convention. The Court of 
Appeal also emphasized the urgency in granting a peremptory return order, 
indicating that detailed considerations should not delay the process.  
In re JA (Child Abduction: Non-Convention Country) [1998] 1 FLR 231, 
the Court of Appeal endorsed the following observations of Singer J.: 
“In the ordinary case, it is in the child‟s best interests for his or her welfare 
to be determined by the court of the country where the child habitually 
resides. The reasons for that have been so often stated that it would be 
superfluous for me to repeat them. It is an important component of the 
principle that the court should not assist or encourage transnational 
abductions, whether or not the Hague Convention applies, but as has most 
recently been pointed out by Ward LJ in his leading judgment in the case 
of Re E (A Minor) (Child Abduction: Non-Convention Country)  
[1997] 2 WLR 223, that and every other general principle in cases 
concerning children‟s welfare must give way to the overriding 
consideration of the child‟s welfare. That case made it clear that it is 
wrong slavishly, as it were, to follow by analogy the principles of Hague 
Convention cases and apply them to non-Convention cases such as this, 
nor is it appropriate to force into that format of a non-Convention case the 
terminology that is appropriate to Hague cases.” 
43. 
 
In re J (a child) (FC), [2005] UKHL 40, Baroness Hale of 
Richmond stated that there is no warrant, either in statute or authority, for 
the principles of the Hague Convention to be extended to countries which 
are not parties to it. This is so even in a case where a friendly State has made 
orders about the child‟s future. Hence, in all non-Convention cases, the 
courts must act in accordance with the welfare of the individual child. If they 
decide to return the child, it is in his best interests, not because some other 
consideration has superseded the welfare principle. The child‟s welfare is 
paramount and the special rules and concepts of the Hague Convention are 
not to be applied by analogy in a non-Convention case. Baroness Hale 
further stated: 
“How then is the trial judge to set about making that choice? His focus has 
to be on the individual child in the particular circumstances of the case. 
The policy considerations which have led this country to enter into 
international treaties for the good of children in general are irrelevant.  
A fortiori, the hope that countries which have not yet become parties to 
such treaties might be encouraged to do so in future is irrelevant. There 
may be good reasons why those countries are unable to join the club. They 
may well believe that it would be contrary to the fundamental principles of 
their laws to accept the reciprocity entailed ...” 
She went on to say: 
 
“… The most one can say, in my view, is that the judge may find it 
convenient to start from the proposition that it is likely to be better for a 
child to return to his home country for any disputes about his future to be 
decided there. A case against his doing so has to be made. But the weight 
to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case.

What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what will 
be best for him in the short run. It should not be assumed, in this or any 
other case, that allowing a child to remain here while his future is decided 
here inevitably means that he will remain here forever.”

India is currently not a party to the Hague Convention. In 
Nithya Anand Raghavan v. State (Nct of Delhi) and another  
(2017) 8 SCC 454, the Indian Supreme Court outlined the following 
principles for child custody cases involving foreign countries: 
(i) 
When a parent abducts their child from abroad and brings them to 
India, courts should prioritize the child‟s welfare. They may 
conduct a summary or elaborate inquiry to decide the custody 
issue.  
(ii) 
In exercising summary jurisdiction, the court must be satisfied that 
the proceeding instituted before it was in “close proximity” and 
filed promptly after the child was removed from their native State 
and brought within its territorial jurisdiction. The child should not 
have gained roots here, and it will be in the child‟s welfare to 
return to their native State because of differences in the language 
spoken, social customs, or other tangible reasons. In such cases, 
the court need not resort to an elaborate inquiry into the merits of 
the child‟s welfare but leave that inquiry to the foreign court by 
directing the child‟s return. The court can still refuse to issue a 
direction to return the child to the native State if their return may 
expose them to a grave risk of harm.  
(iii) 
In an elaborate inquiry, the court is obliged to examine the merits 
regarding where the paramount interests and welfare of the child 
lie and reckon the fact of a pre-existing foreign court order for the 
return of the child as only one of the circumstances. In either case, 
the crucial question to be considered by the court (in the country to 
which the child is removed) is to answer the issue according to the 
child‟s welfare. This has to be done independently, bearing in mind 
the totality of facts and circumstances of each case. 
(iv) 
The principle of comity of courts cannot be given primacy or more 
weightage for deciding the matter of custody or the return of the 
child to the native State. Essentially, the principle of the comity of 
courts is a principle of self-restraint, applicable when a foreign 
court is seized of the issue of the custody of a child prior to the 
domestic court. There may be a situation where the foreign court, 
though seized of the issue, does not pass any effective or 
substantial order or direction. In that event, if the domestic court 
were to pass an effective or substantial order or direction prior in 
the point of time, then the foreign court ought to exercise self-
restraint and respect the direction or order of the domestic court  
(or vice versa) unless there are very good reasons not to do so. The 
principle of comity of courts simply demands consideration of an 
order passed by a foreign court and not necessarily its 
enforcement. 
(v) 
Invoking the first strike principle as a decisive factor would 
undermine the wholesome principle of the duty of the court having 
jurisdiction to consider the best interests and welfare of the child, 
which is of paramount importance. If the court is convinced in that 
regard, the fact that there is already an order passed by a foreign 
court in existence may not be so significant as it must yield to the 
welfare of the child. That is only one of the factors to be taken into 
consideration.

As adumbrated, Pakistan acceded to the Hague Convention on 
December 22, 2016, with certain reservations regarding Articles 24 and 26. 
When the Convention is not applicable, the court must evaluate each case 
individually, focusing on the child‟s welfare. The child‟s habitual residence 
is initially considered a significant factor, but it is not the sole determinant. 
This approach aims to mitigate the trauma and instability caused by parental 
abductions, which are often intended to secure a legal advantage in another 
jurisdiction. Even if a foreign court has issued an order regulating the child‟s 
custody, the domestic court must still weigh it in light of the welfare 
principle, treating it as just one aspect among others rather than the sole 
consideration. Thus, Pakistani courts retain the discretion to refuse the return 
of an abducted child if they determine that such a return would not be in the 
child‟s best interests. This could be the case if the child has settled into their 
new environment, or if returning would expose them to physical or 
psychological harm, or if the child is sufficiently mature and objects to the 
return. 
46. 
 
Even before Pakistan acceded to the Hague Convention, the 
country‟s courts consistently held that the decisions of foreign courts did 
not, by their own force, bar the filing of the application for the custody of 
minors, particularly when circumstances changed. A foreign court‟s order 
was one of the factors to be considered by the Family Court, but it was not 
conclusive of the controversy. In this regard, reference may be usefully 
made to Abu Saeed A. Islahi v. Talat Mir and others (1994 MLD 1370). 
High Court’s jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution 
47. 
 
Before July 1954, the habeas corpus jurisdiction vested in the 
High Courts under section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 
(“Cr.P.C.”). After that, the Government of India (Amendment) Act, 1954 
also conferred constitutional power on the High Courts to issue such writ by 
inserting section 223-A in the Government of India Act, 1935. Article 170 of 
the 1956 Constitution, Article 98 of the 1962 Constitution, and now Article 
199 of the 1973 Constitution have maintained this jurisdiction. In 
Muhammad Ajmal Khan v. Lt.-Col. Muhammad Shafaat and others  
(PLD 1976 Lahore 396), A.R. Sheikh, J. held that the High Court‟s 
jurisdiction under Article 199(1)(b)(i) of the Constitution of 1973 is much 
wider than section 491 Cr.P.C. 

Writ Petition No.78185/2023

48. 
 
Specifically, Article 199(1)(b)(i) states that subject to the 
Constitution, if the High Court is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is 
provided by law, upon the application of any person, it may issue an order 
directing a person in custody within its territorial jurisdiction to be brought 
before it to ensure that he has not been unlawfully detained. Habeas corpus 
is available against anyone suspected of unlawfully detaining another 
person, not just jailors, police officers, or other public officials whose duties 
normally include arrest and detention. It may also be filed in respect of 
minors. In Qurat-ul-Ain v. Station House Officer, Police Station Saddar 
Jalalpur Jattan, District Gujrat, and others (2024 SCMR 486), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan observed that when a writ of habeas corpus is 
sought for the production of a child, it is not for the liberation of a detenue or 
a prisoner. The issue concerns his nurture, control, and education in such 
cases.12 
49. 
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan has consistently maintained that 
the High Court‟s jurisdiction under Article 199(1)(b)(i) of the Constitution  
(and section 491 Cr.P.C.) should be sparingly invoked for the custody of 
minor children and only under specific circumstances. In Nadia Perveen v. 
Almas Noreen and others (PLD 2012 SC 758), the Supreme Court ruled 
that the High Court may entertain matters related to the custody of minor 
children while exercising its habeas corpus jurisdiction if the following 
conditions are met. Firstly, the children involved must be of very tender age. 
Secondly, they should have quite recently been snatched away from lawful 
custody. Lastly, there must be a real urgency in the matter. The Supreme 
Court further stated that even if these conditions are fulfilled, the High Court 
may only regulate interim custody of the children, leaving the matter of final 
custody to be determined by the Family Court. It highlighted that the Family 
Court has ample powers to recover minor children and regulate their interim 
custody.13 
                                          
12 In this context, the Supreme Court cited the following excerpt from R v. Barnardo (1891) 1 QB 194: 
“ … to determine whether the person who has the actual custody of them (infants) as children shall 
continue to have the custody of them as children. In such cases, it is not a question of liberty, but 
of nurture, control and education.” 
13 Also see: Muhammad Javed Umrao v. Uzma Vahid (1988 SCMR 1891), Nisar Muhammad and another 
v. Sultan Zari (PLD 1997 SC 852), Naziha Ghazali v. The State and another (2001 SCMR 1782);  Khalida 
Perveen v. Muhammad Sultan Mehmood and another (PLD 2004 SC 1); and  Qurat-ul-Ain v. Station 
House Officer, Police Station Saddar Jalalpur Jattan, District Gujrat, and others (2024 SCMR 486).

In Qurat-ul-Ain, the Supreme Court held that the High Court‟s 
jurisdiction under Article 199(1)(b)(i) of the Constitution is subject to the 
satisfaction that no other adequate remedy is provided by law. A writ of 
habeas corpus is not to be issued as a matter of course, particularly when it 
is sought against a parent for the custody of a child. There must be clear and 
compelling reasons for issuing such a writ. The Supreme Court criticized the 
tendency of High Courts to unhesitatingly involve law enforcement agencies 
in family matters, particularly when there is no criminal element involved 
and the child is under the lawful custody of a parent. The Supreme Court 
noted that such actions could cause unnecessary trauma and harassment to 
the affected parent, especially if the parent is the biological mother. 
Therefore, the High Court should proceed with great care, caution, and 
restraint. It may exercise its constitutional jurisdiction only in exceptional 
circumstances, where all other measures have failed, and criminal actions 
such as forced removal, kidnapping, or abduction of the child are apparent. 
The following excerpt is relevant: 
“A perusal of the [impugned] order reveals that at no stage had the High 
Court (a) satisfied itself that no alternative or efficacious remedy was 
available to Respondent No.3; (b) shown why it had deemed the 
production of the child appropriate when she was admittedly with her 
mother; or (c) on what basis the continued custody of the minor with her 
real mother was even prima facie „without lawful authority or in an 
unlawful manner‟, which necessitated the production of the minor before 
the court ... Issuance of a writ of habeas corpus in a custody matter should 
be an exception, and not the rule, as the GW Act provide the [Family] 
Court with all requisite powers to pass and enforce its orders in matters of 
custody of the child(ren). It is, in our opinion, inappropriate for a 
constitutional court to encroach upon and arrogate itself the powers of a 
[Family] Court, which is the court of competent jurisdiction under the law, 
to decide all matters relating to custody of child(ren).” 
51. 
 
The High Court‟s jurisdiction under Article 199(1)(b)(i) of the 
Constitution (and section 491 Cr.P.C.) and the jurisdiction of the Family 
Court under the GWA are fundamentally distinct and serve different 
purposes. In Muhammad Javed Umrao v. Uzma Vahid (1988 SCMR 1891), 
the Supreme Court explained: 
 
“The Guardian and Wards Act, as the title itself suggests, deals with the 
Guardians, Wards, and the problems and questions relating to them. 
Section 7 relates to the appointment of a guardian by the court, and section 
12 authorizes the court to make interlocutory orders for the protection of 
minors and interim protection of their person and property. The two 
matters, one dealt with by section 491 Cr.P.C. and the other under the 
Guardians and Wards Act, are entirely different, and there is no question 
of one excluding the other, the one overlapping the other, or the one 
destroying the other. The law, as it stands, shows no such repugnancy. It is 
true that the facts of individual cases may be such where the cover of 

Writ Petition No.78185/2023

proceedings of one sort is taken for advancing the cause of another. In 
such cases, it has to be ascertained as to what is the substance of the 
proceedings, and thereafter, the proceedings are to be diverted to the 
appropriate channel, be it of section 491 Code of Criminal Procedure or 
one under the Guardian and Wards Act.”14 
52. 
 
Given the above, the High Court‟s jurisdiction to issue a writ of 
habeas corpus is not affected by the pendency of the guardianship matter 
before a Family Court.15 Nonetheless, it is reiterated that it cannot be used 
for declaring a guardian or determining the question of custody of the minor 
for all times to come.16 
53. 
 
Mr. Shad has argued that in Qurat-ul-Ain, the Supreme Court 
whittled down the principle established earlier in Muhammad Javed Umrao. 
It has held that the GWA offers an alternative and effective remedy and that 
a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is incompetent to recover children 
from a parent. This argument is flawed. Firstly, Qurat-ul-Ain had peculiar 
facts. In that case, the grandmother filed a constitutional petition to recover 
her granddaughter from her own mother, alleging that her custody was 
improper because she had contracted a second marriage with a man who was 
a ghair mahram for the child. The High Court directed the SHO to recover 
and produce the child, subsequently ordering that her custody be handed 
over to the grandmother as an interim arrangement and that the concerned 
Family Court shall decide the issue of permanent custody of the child in 
accordance with the law. The mother, dissatisfied with the High Court‟s 
decision, appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the grandmother 
should seek a remedy from the Family Court. Secondly, Qurat-ul-Ain does 
not impose an absolute prohibition on issuing a writ of habeas corpus in 
respect of minors. The Supreme Court clearly stated that in exceptional and 
extraordinary circumstances – where all other methods fail and there is an 
element of criminality, forced removal, kidnapping, or abduction of the  
child – the High Court may exercise its constitutional jurisdiction. Thus, 
Qurat-ul-Ain reaffirms the principles laid down in Muhammad Javed Umrao 
rather than deviating from them. 
                                          
14 This view was reiterated in Mirjam Aberras Lehdeaho v. SHO, Police Station Chung, Lahore, and others 
(2018 SCMR 427). 
15 Muhammad Javed Umrao v. Uzma Vahid (1988 SCMR 1891); Ahmed Sami and others v. Saadia Ahmed

In various international child abduction cases, courts have 
intervened on a habeas corpus petition to safeguard the best interests of the 
child and provide relief to the affected parent. In Louise Anne Fairley v. 
Sajjad Ahmed Rana (PLD 2007 Lahore 300), the mother, a British national, 
and the father, a Pakistani citizen who migrated and settled in the U.K., were 
involved in a custody dispute over their minor child. The father allegedly 
abducted the child from the mother‟s care in Scotland and brought him to 
Pakistan, bypassing law enforcement authorities and violating a Scottish 
court order favouring the mother. The latter filed a petition under Article 
199(1)(b)(i) of the Constitution in the Lahore High Court. The father argued 
that the case did not fall under the said Article 199 because the child‟s 
custody with him could not be deemed “without lawful authority” under 
Pakistani laws. Even section 491 Cr.P.C. did not apply as the custody could 
not be considered “illegal” or “improper”. The High Court rejected this 
contention, holding as follows: 
 
“According to Article 199 (1)(b)(i) of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, this Court has the power and the jurisdiction 
to satisfy itself that the custody of a person is not being held by another 
“without lawful authority” or “in an unlawful manner”. The above are the 
expressions of art, and in spirit, it means that such a custody should not be 
against or unauthorized by law; in defiance of law, in disregard or 
disobedience of law, impermissible under the law, without excuse and 
justification of law. According to section 491 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code, a habeas corpus order can be issued by this Court, if the custody of 
a person held by another is “illegal” or “improper”. Thus, the proposition 
which comes for direct consideration is whether respondent No.1 is 
holding the custody of the minor under the sanction of law or otherwise. 
The case of the petitioner is that there are interdict and residence orders 
passed by the Scottish Court and also an undertaking has been given by 
the respondent No.1 not to remove the minor from the care and control of 
the petitioner and also the jurisdiction of that court, therefore, bringing the 
child over to Pakistan and retaining its custody in breach of the above, is 
thus “without lawful authority”, “illegal” and “improper”.

In Mirjam Aberras Lehdeaho v. SHO, Police Station Chung, 
Lahore, and others (2018 SCMR 427), Mirjam (the mother), a Finnish 
national, married a Pakistani police officer and had three children in Lahore, 
Pakistan. In 2009, the family applied for Canadian immigration (except for 
the father who got permanent resident status which allowed him to enter and 
exit Canada at his convenience) and shifted abroad. After about seven years, 
the father brought two of the minor children to Pakistan, ostensibly for a 
short vacation, and obtained guardianship of them through the Family Court 
without the mother‟s knowledge. When the mother learnt about the Family 
Court‟s ex parte order, she travelled to Pakistan and attempted to see her

children, but the father denied her access. Consequent thereupon, she filed a 
habeas corpus petition in the Lahore High Court to recover the children, 
which was dismissed as not maintainable. The Supreme Court set aside the 
High Court‟s order. It held that since Mirjam genuinely believed that the 
children had been removed from her custody through deception and trickery 
and subsequently forced to stay in Pakistan against their will, she could 
rightfully approach the High Court for redress. The High Court was 
competent under sections 491 and 561-A Cr.P.C. to provide her relief. The 
Supreme Court nixed the contention that the remedy under section 491 
Cr.P.C. was barred due to the availability of an alternative remedy through 
the Family Court. It further stated that the Supreme Court and the High 
Court also have parental jurisdiction. They must consider the welfare of 
minors and ensure that no harm or damage occurs to them physically or 
emotionally due to a breakdown in the family ties between parents. The 
Supreme Court went on to say that since the children were old enough to 
form an intelligent preference, the High Court erred in law by failing to 
determine their wish. It was obligated to make a balanced and dispassionate 
assessment of the situation to protect their physical safety, emotional well-
being, and welfare. The Supreme Court struck down the ex parte Guardian 
Certificate and directed the Family Court to decide the matter afresh after 
hearing the parties. As an interim measure, it handed over the custody of the 
minors to the mother.17

To sum up, under Article 199(1)(b)(i) of the Constitution  
(and under section 491 Cr.P.C.), the High Court possesses the authority to 
issue a writ of habeas corpus to ensure that a person is not being unlawfully 
detained within its territorial jurisdiction. Although legally speaking, it can 
issue the aforesaid writ in respect of minors, it must only exercise this 
jurisdiction in exceptional circumstances, particularly when no other 
adequate legal remedies are available, the children involved are very young, 
have been recently taken from lawful custody, and there exists an urgent 
need for intervention. In such cases, the High Court‟s role is strictly limited 
to determining interim custody, leaving final custody decisions to the Family 
Court, which has the specialized function under the GWA to handle such

Islamabad High Court by order dated 28.12.2022); Muhammad Faraaz Shaikh v. Javeria Shahani and 
others (C.P. No. S-678/2022 decided by the Sindh High Court by order dated 25.01.2024).

matters comprehensively. The emphasis is on exercising this jurisdiction 
sparingly to avoid undue trauma or harassment, especially to biological 
mothers, and to avoid encroaching upon the domains reserved for Family 
Courts. In situations of international child abduction (whether falling under 
the Hague Convention or not), the High Court is competent to intervene, 
particularly when the removal of the child breaches existing legal custodial 
arrangements because it renders the custody “without lawful authority”, 
“illegal”, and “improper”. This legal framework underscores a cautious and 
balanced approach to safeguarding children‟s physical safety, emotional 
well-being, and overall welfare while respecting legal jurisdictions and 
custodial rights. 
The case in hand

Pakistan and Canada are both signatories to the Hague 
Convention. However, they have yet to reciprocally acknowledge each 
other‟s accession. Consequently, the Convention is not enforceable between 
them. 
58. 
 
The facts narrated above reflect that on 18.02.2022, Respondent 
No.1 appeared before the Ontario Court and tried to get an order for 
temporary custody of Zoran, Zarayb, and Zaviyar, representing that she 
intended to remain in Ontario with them. The court, focusing on primary 
residence and parenting time, directed Respondent No.1 to return the two 
older children to the Petitioner‟s care and asked the latter to re-enroll them at 
Jean Lumb Public School immediately. It ruled that the two older children 
would primarily reside with the father and the youngest with the mother, 
with specified visitation schedules. It prohibited changing the schools or 
relocating the children without the court‟s approval. It appears that 
Respondent No.1 was not satisfied with these arrangements and unlawfully 
removed the children to Pakistan. Moreover, the allegations of fraudulent 
conduct in obtaining orders from the Family Court in Lahore are deeply 
concerning. Therefore, this petition under Article 199 of the Constitution is 
maintainable on the touchstone of the law enunciated by the Supreme Court 
in the legal precedents discussed above. 
59. 
 
Mr. Shad has also contested this petition on the basis of the 
doctrine of election of remedies. This principle suggests that when a party 
has the right to choose one of two or more appropriate but inconsistent

remedies and, with full knowledge of all the facts and his rights, makes a 
deliberate choice of one of them, he is bound by his election and estopped 
from subsequently electing and resorting to the other remedy.18 Mr. Shad 
argues that the Petitioner, having elected to seek a remedy before the Family 
Court, cannot simultaneously invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of this 
Court. However, in my view, the election of remedies doctrine does not 
apply to the present case. As discussed earlier, in Muhammad Javed Umrao, 
the Supreme Court determined that the habeas corpus petition and the 
proceedings under the GWA are distinct. Neither one excludes the other, 
overlaps with the other, or destroys the other.

The legal concept of “maintainability of lis” is distinguishable 
from “entitlement to relief”. Maintainability of lis refers to a party‟s legal 
standing or right to bring an action before the court. It includes meeting 
preliminary requirements for the court to accept the case, such as proper 
jurisdiction, the legal capacity of the parties to sue or be sued, the existence 
of a justiciable controversy, and adherence to procedural rules like correct 
pleadings and timeliness. If a case is deemed not maintainable, the court will 
not proceed to examine its merits. On the other hand, “entitlement to relief” 
involves a claimant‟s substantive right to the remedy or relief sought in the 
lawsuit. This determination is based on the merits of the case, requiring the 
court to evaluate the evidence and apply relevant laws to decide if the 
claimant has a valid claim. Entitlement to relief is considered only after the 
court has determined that the case is maintainable. To put it differently, 
when a petition is described as “maintainable,” it means that it fulfils the 
procedural requirements for court consideration and adjudication. 
Essentially, the court thereby affirms that the lawsuit is correctly filed and 
falls within its jurisdiction. However, this determination does not affect the 
final outcome or decision on the case‟s merits. It merely allows the legal 
process to proceed, enabling the court to hear arguments from both sides, 
review evidence, and apply relevant laws to reach a final decision.19 
61. 
 
Having held that the petition is maintainable, let‟s delve into the 
merits of the case. The Petitioner has produced two orders from the Ontario 
                                          
18Trading Corporation of Pakistan v. Devan Sugar Mills Limited and others (PLD 2018 SC 828). 
 19 See: Muhammad Nasim Siddiqui v. Ali Akbar (PLD 2018 Sindh 703); and Capt. Tariq Mehmood Malik v. 
PALPA Pilots Occupational Disability Fund Trust (2022 CLC 862).

Court, dated 18.02.2022 and 22.11.2023. When the Ontario Court passed the 
first order, it was concerned with the issue of the children‟s primary 
residence and parenting time. Consequently, it made certain arrangements on 
a “temporary, without prejudice basis”. The second order contains directives 
for ensuring the children‟s return to Canada. Thus, the case before the 
Ontario Court was still at its preliminary stage, and it did not make any final 
determination regarding the best interests of the children when Respondent 
No.1 relocated them to Pakistan. 
62. 
 
As adumbrated, the overarching principle in cases involving the 
question of custody is the determination of the welfare of the child, as 
enshrined in section 17 of the GWA. This provision explicitly directs courts 
to prioritize the child‟s well-being in accordance with relevant laws. Section 
17(3) allows courts to consider the preferences of mature minors. In J v. C 
(an infant) [1970] AC 668, the House of Lords emphasized that ensuring the 
child‟s best interests involves a “process, whereby all the relevant facts, 
relationship, claims and wishes of parents, risks, choices, and other 
circumstances are taken into account and weighed, the course to follow will 
be that which is best in the interest of the child.” Similarly, in Shaista Habib 
v. Muhammad Arif Habib and others (Civil Petition No. 3801 of 2022 
decided on 06.03.2023),20 the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that the issue 
of custody entails taking into account aspects pertinent to the upbringing, 
nurturing, and fostering of the child, which encompasses their emotional, 
personal, and physical welfare. The primary aim is to safeguard the child‟s 
overall growth and development. 
63. 
 
In this petition, the Petitioner has exclusively focused on the 
violation of the Ontario Court‟s orders. He has not clarified how granting 
him custody would promote the children‟s well-being. Similarly, 
Respondent No.1 has not elaborated in her pleadings on how their interests 
would be served if custody were awarded to her. As a result, there is no 
material before this Court to adequately assess the pivotal issue of the 
children‟s welfare, which lies at the heart of these proceedings. 
64. 
 
On 19.04.2021, Respondent No.1, through her Special 
Attorney, Muhammad Yaqoob (Respondent No.2), applied to the Family

Court in Lahore under section 7 of the GWA for appointment as the 
children‟s guardian. The Family Court accepted her application by an order 
dated 25.11.2021. The Petitioner alleges fraud and misrepresentation by 
Respondent No.1 and has challenged that order under section 12(2) CPC. 
The Family Court suspended its order to inquire into these allegations, and 
the matter is still pending. Evidence needs to be recorded to resolve this 
controversy between the Parties. 
65. 
 
In view of the above, this Court must not intervene in the matter 
while exercising its constitutional jurisdiction and direct the Petitioner to 
seek redress in the Family Court. 
Disposition 
66. 
 
This petition is disposed of in the following terms: 
(i) 
The Petitioner may pursue remedy before the Family 
Court, Lahore.  
(ii) 
The allegations of fraud and deceit against Respondent 
No.1 are serious. The Family Court is directed to prepare 
a separate file and initiate proceedings under section 476 
Cr.P.C. against Respondents No.1 & 2 and those 
complicit with them.  
(iii) 
The Family Court shall conduct proceedings in all other 
matters between the Parties (including those under 
section 476 Cr.P.C.) on a day-to-day basis and ensure 
they are concluded within the next two months. 
(iii) 
The children are with Respondent No.1 at present. The 
Family Court shall also draw a timetable so that the 
Petitioner can access them and have reasonable parenting 
time until it decides the litigation between the Parties. 
 
(iv) 
Neither party shall take the children out of the 
jurisdiction of the Family Court without its prior 
permission.
