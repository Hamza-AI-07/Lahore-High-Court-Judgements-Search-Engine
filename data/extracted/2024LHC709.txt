      Anwaar Hussain, J.  This constitutional petition is directed against 
the impugned order dated 06.07.2023 passed by the Appellate 
Authority by virtue of which the petitioner’s appeal was dismissed.  
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
petitioner applied for the post of Naib Qasid, pursuant to an 
advertisement dated 27.01.2022. He is admittedly a person with special 
ability as well as Hafiz-e-Quran. Per advertisement, the candidates 
were required to be literate (خواندہ) and in case of holding additional 
qualification of Matric, the extra marks were to be awarded to such 
candidate. The petitioner, while applying for the said post, mentioned 
his additional qualification of Al-Shahadat-us-Sanwiya Al-Aama (as 
equivalent to Matric) and was awarded 20 extra marks. As a result, his 
total marks were calculated to be 65 inclusive of 20 extra marks for the 
additional qualification and his name was reflected at Serial No.1 in the 
final merit list. However, he was not appointed, which constrained the 
petitioner to file W.P. No.19336/2022 that was dismissed by this Court, 
vide order dated 28.02.2023, on the ground that the petitioner obtained 

2 
W.P. No.15167 of 2023 
 
 
additional qualification after the lapse of period of 190-days, which is 
the period of validity for the merit list, under the Recruitment Policy, 
2022. Against order dated 28.02.2023 passed by this Court in W.P. 
No.19336/2022, an Intra-Court Appeal was preferred, which was 
disposed of and the matter was remitted to the Appellate Authority to 
re-examine the same. Through the impugned order, the said 
representation/appeal has been dismissed.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the only 
qualification required for the post of Naib Qasid was that a candidate 
should be literate and no additional educational qualification was 
required, therefore, the petitioner should have been appointed when his 
name was reflected at serial No. 1 of the merit list. Adds that the delay 
by the department in not verifying the additional qualification of Al-
Shahadat-us-Sanwiya Al-Aama (as equivalent to Matric) and intimating 
the deficiency therein to the petitioner, within period of validity of 
merit list cannot be attributed to the petitioner and this material aspect 
of the matter has been overlooked by the Appellate Authority while 
passing the impugned order, hence, the same is liable to be declared 
illegal.  
4. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer supports the impugned order.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
It is undisputed that the qualification of course of Al-Shahadat-
us-Sanwiya Al-Aama, as a matter of policy, does not ipso facto equate 
with and is not equivalent to the matriculation qualification unless a 
candidate having passed the said course also undertakes and clears the 
examination of three additional subjects i.e., Urdu, English and 
Pakistan Studies. The said course coupled with these three subjects 
collectively makes up the qualification of matriculation and only then 
entitled to equivalence. It is admitted on both hands that the said 
examination of three subjects had not been passed and/or undertaken 
by the petitioner before or at the time when the merit list of 02.03.2022 
was finalized.  When the merit list was finalized, the respondents relied 

3 
W.P. No.15167 of 2023 
 
 
on the additional qualification of the petitioner, which earned him 20 
extra marks and he was placed at Serial No.1, but admittedly, on the 
said date, the petitioner did not possess the requisite qualification and 
the process of verification was initiated through letter dated 28.06.2022 
written by Deputy Director Food, Multan Division, Multan and the fact 
that the petitioner was required to pass three additional papers was 
intimated to the petitioner through letter dated 06.09.2022 and in the 
meanwhile, the validity of the merit list expired and the petitioner 
passed the said extra papers.  
7. 
It is the case of the petitioner that verification process was to be 
initiated by the department and concluded within a period of 190-days 
of the preparation of final merit list and any delay occurred thereof 
cannot be attributed to the petitioner and had the petitioner been 
informed well in time about the deficiency in his additional 
qualifications that earned him extra marks and placed him at first 
position in the recruitment process, the same could have been rectified. 
The argument is hard to persuade and is devoid of merits. The 
department invited applications from the general public which entitled 
all the participants to be considered as per their qualification and 
credentials on the basis of equal treatment with the additional marks to 
be awarded only to those candidates which possessed additional 
qualification at that relevant time. The petitioner was awarded 
additional marks on account of his averment that he possessed such 
additional qualification at that time which later on turned out that he 
did not possess the said qualification. This in fact put other 
applicants/contestants on a disadvantageous position and inverse 
discriminatory 
treatment 
was 
meted 
out 
to 
the 
other 
contestants/applicants as the petitioner was awarded extra marks to the 
exclusion of the other contestants, which he was not entitled to at the 
time of preparation of the merit list. Though the petitioner has not been 
appointed on account of expiry of the validity period of the list, the   
turn of events as spelled out above itself render the entire                   
process of awarding 20 additional  marks to the petitioner unlawful and  
 

4 
W.P. No.15167 of 2023 
 
 
 
discriminatory against the other contestants for the post of Naib Qasid. 
Therefore, even if the validity period of merit list/waiting list had not 
elapsed, the appointment of petitioner, if made, on account of extra 
marks awarded for additional qualification which he did not possess at 
that time cannot sustain in the eyes of law and flies in the face of the 
equality clause. The petitioner should have been aware about the 
equivalence requirements for a candidate possessing qualification of 
the course of Al-Shahadat-us-Sanwiya Al-Aama, before submitting his 
application and admittedly, as on the date when the final merit list was 
prepared, the petitioner was not entitled to the equivalence certificate 
on account of the deficiency discussed hereinabove. 
8. 
This Court is of the opinion that, in any recruitment process, the 
purpose of preparation and affixation of the waiting list is that if any 
selected candidate does not join then the candidate next in line would 
be considered for appointment. Certainly, the object of maintaining a 
waiting list is not to enable a candidate to make up any deficiency in his 
additional qualifications entitling him to the award of extra marks as the 
requisite qualification for a post has to be complete as on the cut-
off/closing date of the job application. If someone is deficient with 
respect to the requisite qualification (including additional qualifications 
forming basis of award of extra marks) on the cut-off date/closing date, 
the subsequent improvement would not operate retrospectively unless 
some law and/or policy so envisages. Learned counsel for the petitioner 
has not been able to refer any such legal provision or policy of the 
Government. Therefore, the petitioner has no vested right to be 
appointed to the post of Naib Qasid on the basis of extra marks obtained 
on the account of additional qualification, which he did not possess on 
the cut-off/closing date of submission of application or at the time of 
finalization of the final merit list when the extra marks for such 
additional qualification were awarded.

In view of what has been discussed above, this petition has no 
merits, hence, dismissed. No order as to costs.
