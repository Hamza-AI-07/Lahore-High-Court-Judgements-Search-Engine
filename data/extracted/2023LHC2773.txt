JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing 
24-05-2023 
Petitioner by 
Mr. Muhammad Ikram Ullah Khan, 
Advocate. 
Respondent No.3 by 
Mr. Aftab Hussain Qureshi, Advocate. 
 
ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. Through this Constitutional 
Petition, the petitioner has challenged judgment and decree 
dated 23.02.2019, passed by learned Judge Family Court only 
to the extent of quantum of maintenance allowance, and the 
judgment and decree dated 11.09.2020, passed by learned 
Appellate Court in toto (impugned judgment & decree). 
2. 
Relevant facts are that the petitioner filed a suit for 
recovery of maintenance allowance and dower amount of 
Rs.500,000/- 
(dower) 
against 
the 
respondent 
No.3 
(respondent) during subsistence of marriage. The said suit was 
decreed on 23.02.2019 for the dower amount of Rs.500,000/- 
and for maintenance allowance @ Rs.5,000/- per month with 
10% increase per annum. The petitioner did not challenge the 
said decree, however, the respondent filed Appeal. The learned 
Appellate Court, vide impugned judgment and decree dated 

[-2-] 
Writ Petition No.5278 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
11.09.2020, dismissed the Appeal against entitlement of 
maintenance allowance, however, accepted the Appeal against 
dower and declined the same on the ground that the dower 
being deferred cannot be claimed during subsistence of 
marriage. The respondent did not challenge the said judgment 
and decree, however, the petitioner being aggrieved has filed 
this Constitutional Petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the 
maintenance allowance of Rs.5,000/- per month is inadequate. 
He further submits that the dower mentioned in Column No.13 
of the Nikahnamma (Exh.P1), being payable on demand, is 
prompt and not deferred dower, therefore, the impugned 
judgment & decree is not sustainable. He placed reliance on 
“MUHAMMAD 
QAYYUM 
ANJUM 
Vs. 
ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT JUDGE, MUZAFFARGARH and 2 others” (2022 
MLD 416) and “MUHAMMAD SAJJAD Vs. ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT AND SESSIONS JUDGE and 2 others” (PLD 2015 
Lahore 405). 
4. 
Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, 
submits that as no specific time for payment of the dower was 
stipulated, therefore, the dower being deferred is only payable 
on dissolution of marriage either by death or divorce. He placed 
reliance on “Dr. NOOR MUHAMMAD SALEEMI SAGGU Vs. 
ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE and another” (2020 MLD 

[-3-] 
Writ Petition No.5278 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
1008) and “SAADIA USMAN and another Vs. MUHAMMAD 
USMAN IQBAL JADOON and another” (2009 SCMR 1458). 
He further submits that the petitioner herself gave affidavit 
dated 02.06.2017 (Exh.D4) to the effect that the dower was not 
agreed in Nikahnamma, therefore, the same is not recoverable. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. So far as the claim of 
petitioner for enhancement of maintenance allowance is 
concerned, admittedly the petitioner did not challenge the 
quantum of maintenance allowance @ Rs.5,000/- determined 
by learned Judge Family Court, vide judgment & decree dated 
23.02.2019 at the relevant time, therefore, the said amount has 
already attained finality and cannot be challenged by the 
petitioner at this stage. Similarly, the plea of respondent that 
claim of the dower was abandoned by the petitioner in her 
affidavit (Exh.D4) cannot be urged, as the learned Appellate 
Court did not accept the said plea rather by treating the dower 
as deferred held that petitioner is not entitled for the dower 
during subsistence of marriage. The said finding of learned 
Appellate Court being not challenged by the respondent, he 
cannot argue that the dower is not payable at all in view of 
Exh.D4. 
6. 
However, the only question which requires determination 
in this case is that whether the dower amount is prompt or 
deferred. In this context, perusal of Column No.13 of the 

[-4-] 
Writ Petition No.5278 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
Nikahnamma shows that the dower of Rs.500,000/- is 
ِ عِ ا ندِ لط
لب 
(Ind-at-Talab). The word “Ind-at-Talab” is the word of Urdu 
language and its English translation is  “on demand” as per 
“OXFORD Urdu—English Dictionary” of Oxford University 
Press as well as “FEROZSONS Urdu—English Dictionary” of 
Ferozsons (Pvt.) Ltd. The Urdu to Urdu Dictionary i.e. 
"
"فیر وزُاللّغات defines the word “Ind-at-Talab” in following 
terms:- 
"
 دَالطّلب
عِ ن: امےنگن ےکوتق۔ اطمےبل رپ۔"
 
 
 
The above dictionary meanings/translations of “Ind-at-Talab” 
make it abundantly clearly that the dower in-question is payable 
on demand.  
7. 
Now the next ancillary question is that whether dower 
payable on demand is prompt or deferred dower. In this regard, 
Para-290 of the Muhammadan Law defines “Prompt” & 
“Deferred” dower as under: 
“290 “Prompt and Deferred” dower. --- (1) 
the amount of dower is usually split into two 
parts, one called “prompt” which is 
payable on demand, and the other  called 
“deferred” which is payable on dissolution 
of marriage by death or divorce.”  
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in Saadia Usman’s case 
supra, after detailed discussion while interpreting the ‘prompt 
& deferred’ dower, held as under: 
“Thus, we are of the opinion that prompt 

[-5-] 
Writ Petition No.5278 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
dower is payable on demand during the 
subsistence of marriage tie whereas the 
deferred dower is payable on the time 
stipulated between the parties, but where no 
time is stipulated, it is payable on 
dissolution of marriage either by death or 
divorce. But, the deferred dower does not 
become “prompt” merely because the wife 
has demanded it.”  
 
 
In terms of Para-290 of Muhammadan Law and the law 
settled by Hon’ble Supreme Court in Saadia Usman’s case 
supra, the “prompt dower” is payable on demand, whereas 
“deferred dower” is payable on dissolution of marriage either 
by death or divorce unless time is stipulated between the parties 
for payment of deferred dower.  
8. 
In the present case, Column No.13 of the Nikahnamma 
does not specifically mention that Five Hundred Thousand 
Rupees was prompt dower or deferred rather only mentions that 
same is dower payable on demand, which means that it is not 
deferred dower, payable only on dissolution of marriage either 
by death or divorce, but same is payable at time of demand 
even before dissolution of marriage. When under Para-290 of 
Muhammadan Law, prompt dower is payable on demand, then 
it will be a fallacy to argue that the dower payable on demand is 
deferred dower and payable only on dissolution of marriage by 
death or divorce. Learned High Courts repeatedly treated the 
“dower payable on demand” as prompt dower and not deferred 

[-6-] 
Writ Petition No.5278 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
 
dower, payable on dissolution of marriage due to death or 
divorce in the following case laws:- 
i- “MUKHTAR AHMAD Vs. DISTRICT JUDGE and 
others” (2023 YLR 193) 
ii-, 
“MUHAMMAD 
RAFIQUE 
Vs. 
ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT JUDGE SIALKOT and others” (2022 YLR 
2067),  
iii- 
“MUHAMMAD 
SAJJAD 
Vs. 
ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT AND SESSIONS JUDGE and 2 others” 
(PLD 2015 Lahore 405),  
iv- “ADAM Vs. Mst. ABIDA and 2 others” (PLD 2015 
Balochistan 26),  
v- “Mst. SALMA BIBI and another Vs. MUHAMMAD 
IQBAL and 2 others” (PLD 2014 Peshawar 60).  
vi- “Mst. KULSOOM BIBI through Attorney Vs. 
MUHAMMAD WASEEM and 3 others” (2015 YLR 
2375).  
9. 
The above interpretation is also supported by Section 10 
of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (Ordinance), 
according to said provision where no detail about the mode of 
payment of dower is spelled out by the parties in Nikahnamma 
or marriage contract, the entire amount of dower shall be 
presumed to be payable on demand and not necessarily means 
payable on dissolution of marriage by death or divorce. The 
learned Appellate Court has misconstrued the dower payable on 
demand, as deferred dower payable only on dissolution of 
marriage either by death or divorce. The dower being payable 
on demand could be claimed by the petitioner even during 
subsistence of marriage.

10. 
In view of above discussion, this petition is partially 
allowed to the extent that the petitioner shall be entitled for the 
dower amount of Rs.500,000/- from the respondent. The 
impugned judgment and decree is modified accordingly.
