& 2. 
M/s Waleed Iqbal & Wasif Majeed, Advocates for 
respondent No.3. 
Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital, Gujrat, 
issued 
tender 
notice 
for 
procurement 
of 
surgical/disposable items in bulk for hospital use during 
Financial Year 2023-24 through a single-stage-two-
envelopes bidding process as per rule 38(2)(a) of the 
Punjab Procurement Rules, 2014. Bids were received 
consisting of two separate 
envelopes containing 
separately the financial and technical proposals. The 
Technical Proposal was opened first. A Technical 
Evaluation 
Committee 
of 
the 
procuring 
agency 
scrutinized it without any reference to the price sealed in 
the Financial Proposal. Bidders that emerged as 
technically accepted once this process was complete then 
stood to participate in the process of financial bidding 
carried out by opening of the Financial Proposals.  
2.  
The facts from which this case stems pertain to 
the stage of evaluation of the Technical Proposal. The 
matter has still not reached the stage of opening of the 
Financial Proposal as yet. This appears to be on account 
of the path opted to be taken by the petitioner who 
competed. Sealed bids were submitted and opened. 

                                W.P. No.54097 of 2023

During the course of evaluation of the Technical 
Proposal, the Technical Evaluation Committee found 
both the petitioner as well as respondent No.3 to be 
responsive. They are mentioned at serial Nos. 28 and 29 
of the Bid Evaluation Sheet. Petitioner was held to be 
responsive with the exception of item Nos.60 and 82 
whereas respondent No.3 was found responsive with the 
exception of item Nos.95, 96, 122, 124 and 125.  
3.  
The petitioner assailed the responsiveness of 
competitor respondent No.3 by filing a complaint dated 
10.7.2023 before the Grievance Redressal Committee of 
the hospital constituted under of the Rules ibid. 
demanding review of the decision of the Technical 
Evaluation Committee declaring respondent No. 3 and 
one M/s. Global Healthcare to be responsive. The 
objection qua respondent No.3 as encapsulated at bullet 
point No.3 of the petitioner’s complaint/representation is 
reproduced as under for facility of reference: 
“To maintain the highest standards of patient care 
and safety, we kindly request you to reexamine the 
credentials and past experience certificate, DRAP, 
Certificate, Drug Sale License & Free Sale Certificate 
of M/s Endoaid Biomedica.”     
         (emphasis supplied) 
4.  
The Grievance Redressal Committee in its 
meeting on 22.7.2023 considered the complaint of the 
petitioner and after hearing representatives from both 
sides concluded against the responsiveness of respondent 
No.3 as follows: 
“DSL has been expired since 2 November 2022 and 
Receipt is for form 8c (new distributor DSL) so 
keeping in view the stance of the M/S Endoaid 
Biomedica and relevant documentary evidences, 
the Grievance Committee unanimously decided that 
at the time of submission of tender M/S Endoaid 
Biomedica did not possess a valid DSL hence 
grievances of M/S. Popular international Accepted 
and M/S. Endoaid Biomedica declared as Non 
responsive.”

5. 
Respondent No.3 aggrieved of the decision of the 
Grievance Redressal Committee dated 22.7.2023 filed a 
representation before respondent No.1 taking the stance 
as under: 
“…that we are registered as “Importer” of M/s 
RAYSEN 
TIANJIN 
HEALTHCARE, 
WORLDWIDE 
MEDIVEST 
(foreign 
principal) 
with 
the 
Drug 
Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP). The DRAP 
vide notification No.F.10-1/2020-MD dated 04th June 
2021 omitted the requirement of DSL from the “Form-
2 Application form for grant of renewal of an 
establishment license to import medical devices” for 
importers of medical devices (Annex-D).” 
 
 
                    
 
(emphasis supplied) 
By order dated 29.8.2023 the stance of the respondent 
No.3 was accepted and decision of the Grievance 
Redressal Committee to the extent of its non-
responsiveness was set aside and as a result the decision 
of the Technical Evaluation Committee dated 28.6.2023 
declaring said respondent to be responsive in terms 
recorded in the pertinent document was affirmed. 
Through the instant constitutional petition this order of 
respondent No.1 dated 29.8.2023 is now assailed in 
constitutional jurisdiction. 
6.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner on being 
asked to distil his stance, after careful thought, states that 
the objection of the petitioner may be boiled down to the 
fact that respondent No. 3 did not possess valid Drug 
Sale License at the material time of bid submission and 
opening of Technical Proposal which being a mandatory 
requirement the Technical Evaluation Committee erred in 
declaring the respondent “responsive” and that Grievance 
Redressal Committee made the proper corrective by 
ruling against respondent No.3. He submits that 
respondent No.1 committed jurisdictional error in 
revisiting the findings of the Grievance Redressal 
Committee through the impugned order which is illegal.

In amplification it is submitted that the procuring agency 
is authorized to stipulate general and special conditions 
in relation to the procurement and that in the instant case 
mandatory criteria are given in document provided with 
the Bidding Documents titled Bids Evaluation Criteria 
(For Medical Devices/Surgical Disposable Items that 
clearly states that the parameters given are compulsory 
and failure to comply shall result in non-responsiveness 
of the bidders. He refers to stipulation at serial No.4 of 
the said document which, according to him, encapsulates 
the case as it makes it mandatory to have a Drug Sale 
License. Compulsory parameter pin-pointed thus is 
reproduced below for facility of reference:

7.  
Learned Law Officer as also learned counsel for 
respondent No.3 have opposed this stance. Learned 
counsel for respondent No. 3 submits that the Technical 
Evaluation Committee held on 28.6.2023 comprised 05 
members who were all experts in their field and, as such, 
brought accurate analysis to bear on the technical 
suitability of the bids and that the Grievance Redressal 
Committee’s decision whose members are not that 
qualified was incorrect and was rightly interfered with by 
respondent No.1 through the impugned order. In rebuttal 
counsel for the petitioner has controverted this by 
suggesting that the members of the Grievance Redressal 
Committee are more qualified. The Technical Evaluation

Committee is supposed to make an overall tentative 
evaluation and it is only when a specific objection is 
raised that the matter requires specific technical attention 
and that for such challenge the Grievance Redressal 
Committee is more equipped with senior people having 
better knowhow. This line of exchange may be given a 
short shift as neither is any specific allegation made at 
the conduct or capacity of any of the members in 
pleadings of either party at any of the levels of decision-
making nor is any detailed data produced on record by 
either side so as enable a fair analysis to be made. More 
importantly still, as will emerge later in this judgment, 
determination of the objection of the petitioner, as 
crystallized by submissions of the two sides at the bar, is 
hinged 
on 
contextual 
understanding 
and 
textual 
interpretation.     
8.  
The legal framework as applicable to the 
controversy has been surveyed with the assistance of the 
learned counsel for the respondent No.3 who on 
preceding date was asked to come prepared to assist on 
the distinction between “drugs” and “medical devices”, 
especially, as respondent’s defense against the objection 
of not having a Drug Sale License is that the same is not 
required for bulk supply of “medical devices” and, as 
such, shall not be read as operative as part of the 
compulsory criteria stipulated in the bidding documents 
to the case of the respondent. Learned counsel for the 
petitioner is insistent that the omnibus definition of 
“drugs” as given in the Drugs Act, 1976 shall apply 
which does not draw any distinction between “drugs” and 
“medical devices”, therefore, any such distinction may 
not be formally inserted into the exegetical process.  
9.  
The Drugs Act, 1976 at section 3(g) stipulated 
an inclusive definition of the term “drug” that appeared 

                                W.P. No.54097 of 2023  
 
 
 
        6 
 
 
 
to cover both drugs as well as medical devices. As 
illustration reference is made to mention of the term 
“sutures” in the category of “drugs” as defined which 
functionally is a medical device with needle for stitching 
wounds and surgical incisions and incidentally is inter 
alia also one of the items under objection. The other item 
is disposable gloves. Section 3(g) of the said Act is 
reproduced below for facility of reference which includes 
“sutures” in the list at sub-clause (ii): 
“(g) "drug" includes- 
(i) any substance or mixture of substances that is 
manufactured, sold, stored, offered for sale or 
represented for internal or external use in the 
treatment, mitigation, prevention or diagnosis of 
disease, an abnormal physical state, or the 
symptoms thereof in human beings or animals or the 
restoration, correction, or modification of organic 
functions in human beings or animals, not being a 
substance exclusively used or prepared for use in 
accordance with the ayurvedic, unani, homoeopathic 
or biochemic system of treatment except those 
substances and in accordance with such conditions 
as may be prescribed;  
 
(ii) abortive and contraceptive substances, agents 
and devices, surgical ligatures, sutures, bandages, 
absorbent cotton, disinfectants, bacteriophages, 
adhesive plasters, gelatin capsules and antiseptic 
solutions; 
 
(iii) such substances intended to be used for the 
destruction or repulsion of such vermin, insects, 
rodents and other organism as cause, carry or 
transmit disease in human beings or animals or for 
disinfection in residential areas or in premises in 
which food is manufactured, prepared or kept or 
stored;  
 
(iv) such pesticides as may cause health hazard to 
the public;  
 
(v) any substance mentioned as monograph or as 
preparation in the Pakistan Pharmacopoeia or the 
Pakistan National Formulary or the International 
Pharmacopoeia or the British Pharmacopoeia or the 
British Pharmaceutical Codex or the United States 
Pharmacopoeia or the National Formulary of the 
United States, whether alone or in combination with 
any substance exclusively used in the unani, 
ayurvedic, homoeopathic or biochemic system of 
treatment, and intended to be used for any of the 
purposes mentioned in sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii); 
and

(vi) any other substance which the Federal 
Government may, by notification in the official 
Gazette, declare to be a "drug" for the purposes of 
this Act;” 
 
10. 
Structural changes started when upon passage of 
the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010 on 
19.4.2010 the Concurrent Legislative List was omitted 
from the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution Of Islamic 
Republic Of Pakistan, 1973 and in consequence the all-
encompassing entry of “drugs and medicines” which 
existed as item No.20 of the Concurrent Legislative List 
became part of the provincial legislative domain. Later 
the Provincial Assemblies invoking Article 144 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
passed resolutions to the effect that the Parliament may 
by law regulate the domain so devolved and, as a result, 
Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan Act, 2012 was 
enacted and notified on 13.11.2012. This background is 
embedded in the preamble of the Act of 2012 which 
shows that a Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan was 
being established to provide for effective coordination 
and enforcement of the Drugs Act, 1976 and to bring 
harmony to inter-provincial trade and commerce of 
therapeutic goods and names the Provinces of Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh who passed such 
resolutions.  
11. 
Sub-section (1) of section 32 of the Act of 2012 
states that the provisions of the said Act shall be in 
addition to and not in derogation of the provisions made 
in the Drugs Act, 1976 and any other law for the time 
being in force to clarify that the Act of 2012 shall not 
override other laws, however, sub-section (2) of said 
section 32 provides that in case of inconsistency between 
the provisions of the said Act and any other law for the 
time being in force the provisions of the Act of 2012 

                                W.P. No.54097 of 2023  
 
 
 
        8 
 
 
 
shall prevail. Respondent’s learned counsel in this 
backdrop submits that conception of “drugs” was given a 
more focused form under the Act of 2012 by prescribing 
“drugs” and “medical devices” separate and distinct 
mechanism of identification. This mechanism is injected 
through the interpretation clause of the Act of 2012 
which has distinct provisions in the form of sub-sections 
(xii) and (xviii) of section 2 of the Act of 2012 for “drug” 
and “medical device” respectively. Interestingly against 
both these provisions instead of stipulating concrete 
definitions it is inscribed “as defined in Schedule-I” for 
“drugs” and “as specified in Schedule-I” for “medical 
device”. They as such are given to denote definitions 
ascribed to them by entries in Schedule-I of the said Act 
which the Federal Government has been empowered to 
amend from time to time. Perusal of Schedule-I as 
modified by notification No.S.R.O.824(I)/2018 dated 
26.6.2018 provides the following separate entries for 
“drug” and “medical device”:  
“2. DRUG includes 
(a) 
any substance or mixture of substances that is 
manufactured, sold, stored, offered for sale or 
represented for internal or external use in the 
treatment, mitigation, prevention or diagnosis of 
diseases, an abnormal physical state, or the 
symptoms thereof in human beings or animals or 
the restoration, correction, or modification of 
organic functions in human beings or animals, 
including substance used or prepared for use in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Ayurvedic, 
Unani, 
Homeopathic, Chinese or biochemic system of 
treatment except those substances and in 
accordance with such conditions as may be 
prescribed; 
[(b) 
abortive and contraceptive substances and 
agents, disinfectants, bacteriophages, gelatin 
capsules and antiseptic solution.] 
(c) 
such substances intended to be used for the 
destruction or repulsion of such vermin, insects, 
rodents and other organism as cause, carry or 
transmit disease in human beings or animals or 
for disinfection in residential areas or in premises

        9 
 
 
 
in which food is manufactured, prepared or kept 
or stored; 
(d) 
such pesticides as may cause health hazard to 
the public; 
(e) 
 any substance mentioned as monograph or as a 
preparation in the Pakistan Pharmacopoeia or 
the 
Pakistan 
National 
Formulary 
or the 
International Pharmacopoeia or the British 
Pharmacopoeia or the British Pharmaceutical 
Codex or the United States Pharmacopoeia or 
the National Formulary of the United States, 
whether alone or in combination with any 
substance exclusively used in the Unani, 
Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Chinese or Biochemic 
system of treatment, and intended to be used for 
any of the purposes mentioned in sub-Clauses 
(a), (b) and (c); and 
(f) 
any other substance which the Federal 
Government may by notification in the official 
Gazette, declare to be a drug for the purpose of 
this Act. 
 
 
 
3. MEDICAL DEVICES include 
(a) 
instruments, 
medical 
equipment, 
implants, 
disposables and software, used mainly for the 
purpose of diagnosis, monitoring and treatment 
of disease, or 
(b) 
any other item which the Federal Government 
may, by notification in the official Gazette, 
declare as medical device;” 
Based on this it is submitted that as a matter of fact the 
definition of “drugs” as given by section (3)(g) of the 
Drugs Act, 1976 which presented a blended category for 
“drugs” and “medical devices”, by virtue of section 32(2) 
of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan Act, 2012 
read with section 35 (power to amend the schedule), 
underwent evolution that made it possible to identify 
“drugs” and “medical devices” as distinct categories for 
purposes of formal analysis of rules. It is added that by 
powers conferred under section 23 of the said Act of 
2012, Medical Devices Rules, 2017 were promulgated 
and notified on 16.1.2018 that exclusively regulate 
medical devices as distinct from drugs. It is further 
submitted that rule 21 of the said rules specifies the 

                                W.P. No.54097 of 2023  
 
 
 
        10 
 
 
 
conditions necessary for import of medical devices which 
respondent No.3 duly fulfilled. Learned counsel for the 
petitioner has attempted to argue that “the authentic and 
admitted” definition of “drug” is given in the Drugs Act, 
1976 however neither has he been able to shed any light 
on the provisions of the Act of 2012 nor could make any 
legally persuasive contribution to the interplay between 
the two enactments i.e. the Drugs Act, 1976 and the Drug 
Regulatory Authority Of Pakistan Act, 2012 as to give 
any weight to his contention that consistent reading of 
the two statutes does not admit of the logical as well as 
interpretive possibility of analyzing “drugs” and 
“medical devices” as separate and distinct categories.  
12. 
The items that are the bone of contention 
between the parties as per learned counsel for the 
petitioner are item Nos.43 to 49 in the document titled 
“Rationalized Demand of Surgical/Disposables/Medical 
Devices For Use in Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching 
Hospital Gujrat Justified By Demand Justification/ 
Specification Finalization Committee For The Financial 
Year 2023-24” which is appended at page 85 of the 
parawise comments submitted by respondent No.3  
whereas according to learned counsel for respondent No. 
3 such items are at serial Nos.12, 14 and 47 to 55 thereof. 
Both sides have been unable to show from any of the 
documents appended with the petition, however, as to 
which items of the said documents or for that matter 
tender process altogether were specifically the bone of 
contention. This concern at specificity is all the more 
unsatisfied since the petitioner’s own grievance petition 
before the Grievance Redressal Committee did not make 
any such itemized reference in raising objection. At 
ground “vii.” of the instant constitutional petition 
however mention is made of “Poly propylene, silk and 

                                W.P. No.54097 of 2023  
 
 
 
        11 
 
 
 
surgical gloves” as being the disputed items. Learned 
counsel for the respondent No.3, under instructions, 
states that the items under scrutiny are all encompassed 
by respondent’s Forms-8A under rule 15(5) of the 
Medical Devices Rules, 2017 titled “Certificate Of 
Enlistment Or Registration Of A Medical Device Or 
Accessory Or Component For Import” appended from 
pages 155 to 167 as annex-F, that may be shown to be 
either sutures or gloves and that exhaustive annexures 
“(A)” to these forms carry long lists of various types of 
these registered devices that may safely be stated to 
cover the gamut disputed articles. Learned counsel for 
the petitioner has not seriously disputed this stipulation 
however reiterates that regardless of the fact that these 
are medical devices still a Drug Sale License was 
mandatory as this is a condition given in the compulsory 
criteria provided in the bidding documents.  
13. 
The main strength of this contention comes from 
the compulsory parameter at sr. No. 4 of the Bids 
Evaluation Criteria (For Medical Devices/Surgical 
Disposable Items reproduced earlier above i.e. “copy of 
Drug Manufacturing License/Valid Drug Sale License/ 
Import License for Medical Devices (applicable for 
importers) whichever is applicable” and copy of a Form-
2 titled “Application Form For Grant Or Renewal Of An 
Establishment License To Import Medical Devices”. 
Much stress was laid by learned counsel for the petitioner 
during initial arguments upon this constitutional petition 
upon this form as a direct recognition of the necessity for 
respondent to have a Drug Sales License by stating that 
amongst the details that are required to be furnished for 
purposes of procuring initial grant or renewal of license 
for import of medical devices contains the requirement to 
have a Drug Sale License. Copy of Form-2 titled

As recorded supra much emphasis has been put 
on item Nos. 2(iv) and 2 (viii) of the form supra to claim 
that import of medical devices as per application from for

grant and renewal of license presuppose possession of a 
Drug Sale License and this has been specifically 
deployed as being illuminative of the compulsory 
parameters in the bidding documents. In the parawise 
comments submitted by the respondents the validity of 
this form has been specifically controverted and it has 
been stated that by virtue of notification No.F.10-1/2020-
MD dated 04.6.2021 these very entries at serial No.2 sub-
serial No. (iv) and sub-serial No.(viii) of the said form 
have been deleted from and are no longer part of the 
conditions required to obtain the license for import of 
medical devices that include the devices under objection. 
It is submitted that the petitioner has practiced deliberate 
and active suppression and distortion of this material fact 
as the notification effecting modification in the 
criteria/requirements given in the application form for 
import of medical devices was within the notice of the 
petitioner as it was part of the stance of the respondent 
No.3 in proceedings before the forum below and was also 
otherwise known to all concerned. Notification No.F.10-
1/2020-MD dated 04.6.2021 is reproduced below for 
reference:

The scrutiny of the impugned order dated 29.8.2023 
shows that the learned counsel for both sides were heard 
material portion whereof is reproduced below for facility 
of reference:  
“7.  
Parties heard, available record on the file and reply of 
the Procuring Agency in response to the Complaint lodged by 
the Complainant perused. Accordingly, In view of the foregoing 
arguments and counterarguments, following synthesis is 
derived:  
I. 
Chair asked the representative of the Procuring 
Agency as to why bid of the Complainant was 
declared as non-responsive by GRC. The 
representative of the Procuring Agency apprised 
that as per compulsory parameters of bidding 
documents, the Complainant was required to 
provide a valid DSL whereas the Complainant 
failed to produce the valid DSL at the time of 
submission of bids, therefore, GRC declared the 
bid of the complainant as "non-responsive". Chair 
further asked the representative of the Procuring 
Agency 
under 
which 
law/rule/policy 
the 
requirement 
of 
DSL 
was 
a 
mandatory 
requirement for the procurement of "medical 
devices"? The representative of the Procuring 
Agency failed to quote relevant law/rule/policy 
which required DSL as a mandatory requirement 
for the procurement of medical devices. 
However, the representative of the Procuring 
Agency referred clause 4 of compulsory 
parameters provided in the bidding documents as 
a sole defense. PPRA is of the view that DSL 
could not be demanded for medical devices 
merely on the basis of aforementioned clause 4 
of compulsory parameter as the clause ibid 
clearly stated the submission of relevant 
document/license for the relevant category of 
procurement. Same question regarding non-
submission of valid DSL at the time of 
submission of bids by the Complainant firm was 
also asked from the representative of the 
respondent firm i.e. M/s Popular International 
(Pvt.) Ltd. The representative of the respondent 
firm submitted that it was required as a 
compulsory 
parameters 
in 
the 
bidding 
documents, therefore, the Complainant was 
under an obligation to provide the same. The 
representative of the Complainant countered 
the arguments and submitted that DRAP has 
omitted the requirement of DSL for the import 
of medical devices vide Notification No. F.10-
1/2020-MD dated 04-06-2021 from "Form-2 of 
application form for grant or renewal of an 
establishment license to import medical 
devices". The representative of the Complainant 
further apprised that the quoted products fall 
under the category of "medical devices" instead 

                                W.P. No.54097 of 2023  
 
 
 
        16 
 
 
 
of "medicine/drugs", therefore, requirement of 
DSL was not applicable in the instant case. 
PPRA is of the view that Procuring Agency and 
respondent firm failed to substantiate their claim 
which providing any solid/legal arguments i.e. 
DSL was a mandatory requirement for medical 
devices, therefore, stance of Complainant and 
decision of TEC was justified.  
 
II. 
Chair further asked representative of the 
Procuring Agency as to how the quoted products 
fall under the category of "drugs" and how DSL 
was demanded for such products? The 
representative of the Procuring Agency failed to 
clarify that quoted product fall under the category 
of drugs. The representative of the Complainant 
apprised the Chair that the quoted products 
purely fall under the category of medical 
devices instead of drugs/medicine and 
produced relevant document in this regard 
(i.e. Notification No. F.10-1/2020-MD dated 04-
06-2021 and Form-2) to support his version 
that DSL was not mandatory for the category 
of medical devices. PPRA is of the view that 
the products quoted by the Complainant fall 
under the category of "medical devices", 
therefore, requirement of DSL was not 
mandatory as per the Notification No. F.10-
1/2020-MD dated 04-06-2021 issued by DRAP 
read with clause 4 of the compulsory 
parameter provided in the bidding document; 
detail of which has already been discussed at 
serial No. (I) above”.  
 
The process that began with opening of the Technical 
Proposals, declaration of both the petitioner and 
respondent No. 3 as responsive (with the exception, 
respectively, of item Nos.60 and 82 and item Nos.95, 96, 
122, 124 and 125), acceptance of petitioner’s objection 
against respondent No.3’s responsive status by the 
Grievance Redressal Committee through its decision 
taken in meeting dated 22.7.2023, culminated ultimately 
in the passage of the impugned order dated 29.8.2023 
operative part whereof is recorded supra. Close scrutiny 
thereof shows that the analysis contained therein treats 
the items under controversy as “medical devices” rather 
than “drugs” which appears to be the correct approach in 
view of the state of the law as discussed earlier above 
and interprets the compulsory parameter at sr. No. 4 of 

                                W.P. No.54097 of 2023

the 
Bids 
Evaluation 
Criteria 
(For 
Medical 
Devices/Surgical Disposable Items [i.e. copy of Drug 
Manufacturing License/Valid Drug Sale License/Import 
license for Medical Devices (applicable for importers) 
whichever is applicable] in this context. The term 
“whichever is applicable” is unpacked in the context of 
status of respondent No.3 duly established as registered 
importer of M/s Raysen Tianjin Healthcare Worldwide 
Medivest (foreign principal) with Drug Regulatory 
Authority of Pakistan (DRAP). The analysis concludes 
that by virtue of notification No.10-1/2020-MD dated 
04.6.2021 DRAP omitted the requirement to possess 
drugs sales license for importers of medical devices, 
therefore, the respondent importer would not need to 
have a Drug Sale License at the time of bidding to be 
pass the test of meeting the compulsory criteria. Scrutiny 
of the structure of the compulsory criterion at sr No. 4 
supra shows that it contains the symbol “/” between 
various documents listed therein with the words 
“whichever is applicable” at the end. This clearly reveals 
that within the apparently single criterion stipulated at sr 
No. 4, multiple situations are envisaged and catered for 
by use of the symbol “/” which operates as conjunction is 
the textual construct qualified by the phrase “whichever 
is applicable” at the end. The decision of the Grievance 
Redressal Committee as recorded in its minutes dated 
22.7.2023 is conspicuously non-speaking predicated with 
no attempt to reason to conclusion. This decision appears 
to have been examined in sufficient detail by respondent 
No.1 representing the statutory body vested with 
responsibility of regulating procurement of goods, 
services and works in the public sector and matters 
connected 
therewith. 
The 
analysis

for 
interfering in the decision of the Grievance Redressal

Committee dated 22.7.2023 vide order 29.8.2023 holds 
out on close examination and does not warrant 
interference. As upshot of the above instant petition is 
dismissed. Showing restraint no costs are being imposed, 
however, petitioner shall be careful qua documentary 
reliance in the future to avoid facing penal consequences 
that such action may entail.
