petition within five (05) weeks; less than the time of 120 days 
provided under the law in terms of judgment cited in FAUJI CEMENT 
COMPANY AND ASKARI CEMENT COMPANY versus SECURITIES 
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN and others  
(2022 CLD 604) to give confidence to public and shareholders about 
the decision by the Board of Directors. This Court also through this 
merger petition will develop certain legal points in order to promote 
the companies being merged within time for the business purpose.  
2. 
This petition under Sections 279 to 283 read with Section 285 
of the “Act” has been filed by authorized representative of the 
Petitioners for seeking/obtaining sanction of this Court to a Scheme of 
Arrangement and for merger between Fauji Fertilizer Company 
Limited (“Transferee Company”)/Petitioner No.1 and Fauji Fertilizer 
Bin Qasim Limited (“Transferor Company”)/Petitioner No.2 by 
seeking approval from Securities and Exchange Commission of 
Pakistan (the “SECP”) and Competition Commission of Pakistan (the 
“CCP”) which is mandatory requirement under the respective laws. 
3. 
Briefly stated, the “Transferee Company”/Petitioner No.1 is a 
subsidiary of the Fauji Foundation which carries on business of 
manufacturing, producing, buying, selling, importing, exporting of 
chemical and fertilizers of all kinds alongwith investment in other 
fertilizers, chemical, cement, energy generation, food processing and 
banking operations. The “Transferee Company” is a public limited 
company with an authorized share capital of Rs.15,000,000,000/- 
divided into 1,500,000,000/- ordinary shares of Rs.10/- each which 
are fully subscribed and paid up. Similarly, the “Transferor 
Company”/Petitioner No.2 is manufacturing, purchasing and 
marketing of fertilizers. The “Transferor Company” is a public 
limited 
company 
with 
an 
authorized 
share 
capital 
of 
Rs.15,000,000,000/- divided into 1,500,000,000 ordinary shares of 
Rs.10/- each, out of which 1,291,252,857 ordinary shares have been 
issued and fully paid up.

Civil Original No.04 of 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
in terms of Section 279 to 283 of the “Act” between them and their 
respective shareholders. The principal object of the “Scheme” is to 
amalgamate the entire undertaking of the “Transferor Company” to 
the “Transferee Company” by transferring to, merging with and 
vesting in “Transferee Company” the whole of the “Transferor 
Company”, including all assets, liabilities and obligations of the 
“Transferor Company” against the allotment and issue of the 
“Transferee Company” shares to the “Transferor Company” based 
on the swap ratio and dissolving the “Transferor Company” without 
winding up in accordance with the provisions of the “Scheme”.  
B. 
PETITIONERS’ SUBMISSIONS 
5. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners Barrister Raja Jibran Tariq 
argued that before filing of this petition, all basic requirements 
mentioned in the “Act” and the Companies (Court) Rules, 1997 (the 
“Rules”) have been fulfilled and that too the Petitioners have obtained 
NOCs from all the secured creditors and obtained premerger 
notification under Section 11 of the “Act” from the “CCP”.  Barrister 
Raja Jibran Tariq and Mikael Azmat Rahim also stated that the Court 
has developed sound principles on merger. 
C. 
REPORT OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE 
COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN

comments on behalf of the “SECP” wherein observation with regard 
to non-submission of NOCs by the Petitioners their secured creditors 
have been raised as being still awaited. However, it has been 
requested that the Petitioners may be directed to solicit no objection 
certificates (NOC) from their secured creditors to be submitted before 
the Court for its satisfaction.

from filing pre-merger application in terms of Regulation 5(1)(i) and 
(ii) of the Competition (Merger Control) Regulations, 2016 (the 
“Regulations”).  
E. 
CREDITORS’ STANCE 
8. 
Mr. Mikael Azmat Rahim, Advocate argued that the merger 
petition was drafted as per requirement of the law and it also covered 
the issuance of NOCs from all the creditors as required under the 
commercial law i.e. the Securities and Exchange Commission of 
Pakistan Act, 1997 and the State Bank of Pakistan Act, 1956. He 
submitted that the issue of the NOC from the creditors has been 
carefully dealt with by the Petitioners as per the Scheme of 
Arrangement and also the reports of the Chairmen have been 
obtained in this regard. He refers to page No.1125 (Annexure-K18, 
Volume-IV) which shows the list of secure creditors of the Petitioner 
No.1 alongwith their NOCs, while list of secure creditors of the 
Petitioner No.2 is available at page No.1143 (Annexure-L, Volume-
IV) alongwith their NOCs. He states that since this issue has already 
been acknowledged by the creditors in writing, there is no need to 
hold meetings of the creditors. Learned counsels, who are present in 
the Court today on behalf of different Banks, also submit that they 
have no objection if this merger petition is allowed.  
F. 
PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE CHAIRMEN 
9. 
Pursuant to the direction issued by this Court vide order dated 
08.10.2024, notices were issued to all the creditors within the 
parameters of the Article of Association of the Company and the 
company law. A meeting of the members/ shareholders of the 
Petitioners was convened on 14.11.2024 by complying with the 
requirements of Section 134(3) of the Act and other legal/codal 
requirements and notice of the said meeting, alongwith the Ballot 
Paper for voting through post and proxy form, were also published 
by way of public notices in the recognized newspapers. Queries were 
invited from the members, who also entered into discussion with, and 
raised questions to the Petitioner No.1’s management and ultimately, 
after a detailed deliberation, being fully addressed and satisfied, a 
resolution was passed (through postal ballot, e-voting and voting at 

 
Civil Original No.04 of 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
the meeting as per applicable laws) by the majority as per provisions 
of Section 279(2) of the “Act”. The members of the Petitioner No.1 
voting in favour of said resolution, therefore, represented 
approximately 99.9928% in value of the shares held by the members, 
present in person or by proxy and voting at the meeting, as well as 
voting through e-voting and ballot paper by post/e-mail and during 
the meeting no members verbally raised any objections to the 
Scheme of Arrangement.   
G. 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE COURT 
10. 
Albeit no time frame is provided for merger in the company 
laws but this Court has held on different occasions that every 
authority or forum is bound by time specific legislation and has the 
mandate to decide the matter pending before it in a timely fashion, 
specifically the matters arising out of commercial issues. This Court 
first time in a commercial case reported as M.C.R. (PVT) LTD, 
FRANCHISEE OF PIZZA HUT versus MULTAN DEVELOPMENT 
AUTHORITY and others (2021 CLD 639) held that it is the role of the 
Court to protect the foreign investors, which was subsequently further 
elaborated in the case of WAQAS AYUB versus ADEEL YAQUB etc. 
(2024 CLD 990) by holding that it is the duty of the Courts to 
promote the concept of Alternate Dispute Resolution (the “ADR”) by 
way of developing the confidence of the parties to adopt the “ADR” 
without lengthy litigation before the Courts, which practice would 
definitely strengthen the ecosystem of the “ADR” to promote foreign 
investment in Pakistan. The Courts and the “ADR” have symbiotic 
relationship with critical interdependence as the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in various judgments has emphasized upon strengthening of 
the “ADR”, arbitration and mediation and has settled the principles 
that there should be minimal interference by the Courts in such 
process to make way for speedy, amicable, efficacious and 
expeditious resolution of arbitrable disputes. The Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has also given view in this regard in the case of TAISEI 
CORPORATION and another versus A.M. CONSTRUCTION 
COMPANY (PVT.) LTD. and another (2024 SCMR 640) by holding 
that “Arbitration thus embodies the principles of autonomy and 

 
Civil Original No.04 of 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
voluntariness, respecting the parties' freedom to design a process that 
best suits their needs. It reflects a philosophical shift towards self-
governance in dispute resolution, allowing parties to choose their 
arbitrators and the applicable law, thereby creating a more tailored 
and potentially equitable outcome. The role of courts in the context of 
arbitration has therefore evolved with a trend towards minimal 
interference. More significant is the minimal interference in 
international commercial arbitration that stands as a cornerstone in 
the resolution of cross-border commercial disputes, offering a 
preferred alternative to litigation in national courts for businesses 
worldwide. One of the foundational aspects of international 
commercial arbitration is its emphasis on neutrality, expeditiousness, 
efficiency and the ability to provide solutions tailored to the needs of 
international 
business 
transactions. 
International 
commercial 
arbitration plays a crucial role in resolving disputes arising from 
cross-border trade and commerce, expeditiously and efficiently. The 
global view on international commercial arbitration is therefore 
overwhelmingly positive, with businesses and legal professionals alike 
recognizing its benefits over traditional litigation”. Moreover, this 
Court has also elaborated the provisions of the company law by 
making it clear that according of Section 6(11) of the Companies Act, 
2017 every petition presented to a Company Judge is to be decided 
within one hundred and twenty days from the date of its 
presentation and under the provisions of Sub-Section (7) of this 
section, the Company Judge can fix a date and allocate time for 
hearing of the case in light of the judgment reported as Lt. General 
(Retd.) Mahmud Ahmad Akhtar and another versus M/s Allied 
Developers (Private) Limited and others (2022 CLD 718). For 
reference Section 6(11) of the Act is reproduced hereunder: 
“6. Procedure of the Court and appeal.—(1)---
--------------------------------------------- 
(2) ----------------------------------------------- 
(3) ----------------------------------------------- 
(4) -----------------------------------------------

(10) ---------------------------------------------- 
(11) The petition presented before the Court 
shall be decided within a period of one 
hundred and twenty days from the date of 
presentation of the case and for this purpose 
the Court may, if it is in the interest of justice, 
conduct the proceedings on a day to day basis 
and if the Court deems fit it may impose costs 
which may extend to one hundred thousand 
rupees per day or such higher amount as the 
Court may determine against any party to the 
proceeding causing the delay.” 
 
  
The above-mentioned provision of law clearly demonstrates 
that a company petition whether merger petition or any other petition 
filed before the Company Judge has to be decided within 120 days 
from the date of its presentation before the Company Judge. 
Therefore, in the interest of justice, day to day proceedings should be 
conducted in all company matters. If Section 6(11) is read with the 
“Preamble” of the Act, it would clear that the Act has been 
introduced by the legislature with intent to protect the interests of 
shareholders, creditors, stakeholders and general public by 
inculcating the principles of good governance and safeguarding 
minority interests in corporate entities and providing an alternate 
mechanism for expeditious resolution of corporate disputes as well as 
the matters connected thereto. Previously, in the (repealed) 
Companies Ordinance, 1984 no time frame was given for 
adjudication of company matters. 
11. 
For the foregoing reasons, to improve the corporate sector and 
protect the interest of shareholders, creditors as well as general public 
with the principles of good governance, this Court decides this 
merger petition today within five (05) weeks on the second date of 
hearing keeping in view the provisions contained in Section 6 of the 
Act coupled with the fact that the foundation of rule of law is the 
access to justice and the dispensation of justice in a timely fashion as 
is the mandate of Article 37(d) of the Constitution, which provides in 
unequivocal terms that all the governmental authorities are liable to 
provide inexpensive and expeditious justice to the people of this 

 
Civil Original No.04 of 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
country. The scope of this Article has been further discussed and 
elaborated by this Court in the case of Shaheen Merchant versus 
Federation of Pakistan/National Tariff Commission and others (2021 
PTD 2126) by holding as under: 
“…considering 
the 
nature 
and 
signification of a particular subject-
matter which requires swift and speedy 
resolution of disputes by the judicial 
forums, the legislature has always 
incorporated a time-bound mechanism 
not only for preferring a dispute or 
appeal to the judicial forum or 
Appellate Tribunal, as the case may 
be, but also specifically prescribe and 
lays down a definite time limit to give 
decision thereon to meet the ends of 
expeditious 
justice, 
which 
is 
a 
command of Constitution under Article 
37(d) wherein the State is duty bound 
to ensure inexpensive and expeditious 
justice to the citizens.” 
 
 12. 
This Court vide order dated 08.10.2024 issued notices in 
national newspapers namely “The Dawn” and “Nawa-i-Waqt” for the 
purpose of informing general public about the “Scheme” proposing 
merger of the Petitioners and inviting objections to the “Scheme” 
from members and creditors of the “Petitioners” as well as from any 
person having interest in the affairs of the Petitioners. In addition, 
notices were also directed to be issued to the “SECP”, the “CCP” and 
to the creditors of the Petitioners’ companies as per list of creditors 
attached with the petition. The Chairman of the “SECP” immediately 
sent notice to hold meeting for 14.10.2024 as per statutory 
requirement given under the law and subsequently, the said meeting 
was held, hence, today, this Court allows the merger based on the 
principle already settled in the case of FAUJI CEMENT COMPANY 
AND ASKARI CEMENT COMPANY versus SECURITIES AND 
EXCHANGE 
COMMISSION 
OF 
PAKISTAN 
and 
others  
(2022 CLD 604). On an application (i.e. C.M.No.02/2024) filed 
alongwith the merger petition, the Court appointed Chairmen to 
convene meetings amongst the members/shareholders of the Petitioner 
No.1 and the Petitioner No.2, besides publication of proclamation in 

 
Civil Original No.04 of 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 
the newspaper “Nawa-i-Waqt” and issuing notices to the “SECP” and 
the “CCP”. Pursuant to the notice issued by this Court, both the 
“CCP” and the “SECP” have submitted their respective report/para-
wise comments by making certain submissions therein. Separate 
reports have also been filed by the Chairmen on behalf of the 
Petitioner No.1 and the Petitioner No.2.  
13. 
The merger contemplated under the “Scheme” would have 
significant benefits for the Petitioners’ companies and their respective 
stakeholders, which are stipulated in the “Scheme”. Pursuant to report 
dated 11.11.2024 submitted by the Chairman alongwith the 
resolutions passed in the meetings under Section 279(2) of the “Act”, 
the nucleus of the resolution is reproduced as under:- 
“RESOLVED 
THAT 
the 
Scheme 
of 
Arrangements dated September 26, 2024, for, 
inter 
alia, 
the 
merger, 
by 
way 
of 
amalgamation, of the entire undertaking of 
Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited with and 
into Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited, along 
with all ancillary and incidental matters 
thereto, placed before the meeting for 
consideration and approval, be and is hereby 
approved and adopted, along with any 
modifications/amendments 
required, 
or 
conditions imposed by Honourable Lahore 
High Court, Rawalpindi Bench, subject to 
sanction by the Honourable Lahore High 
Court, Rawalpindi Bench, in terms of the 
provisions of the Companies Act, 2017”.  
 
14. 
In pursuance of the order of this Court dated 08.10.2024, the 
meeting of members of the Petitioner No.1 and the Petitioner No.2 
was convened on 04.11.2024 and so also of the secured creditors of 
the Petitioners and not a single shareholder or secured creditor of any 
of the Petitioner objected to the “Scheme”. The copies of the 
dispatched notices and names of the shareholders as well as the 
notices published in the newspapers are mentioned in and attached to 
the Chairpersons’ report. The attendance sheet of shareholders of the 
Petitioners have also been placed on record which shows the 
participation and voting of 100% shareholders of the Petitioners.  

 
Civil Original No.04 of 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
15. 
So far as the observation of SECP with regard to soliciting 
NOCs from the secured creditors is concerned, it is observed that this 
observation stands cured as all the secured creditors of the 
“Transferee Company” have given their NOCs to the mentioned 
Scheme which are available at Page Nos.1126 to 1143 (Annex-K1 to 
K-17, Volume-IV) while secured creditors of the “Transferor 
Company” submitted their NOCs which are available at Page 
Nos.1144 to 1165 (Annex-L1 to L21).  Furthermore, learned counsels, 
who are present in the Court today on behalf of the Banks, also 
submitted that they have no objection if this merger petition is 
allowed. It has been held in “DEWAN SALMAN FIBER Versus DHAN 
FIBERS LIMITED” (PLD 2001 Lahore 230) that where required 
majority of the members of both of the company has approved the 
resolution of merger of both the companies the sanction for merger 
could not be withheld unless it was shown that same was unfair, 
unreasonable or against the national interest. It was further observed 
that the shareholders were best judges of their interest and were 
better informed with the market trends than the Court, which was 
least equipped in evaluating such trends.   
H. 
SANCTION OF THE SCHEME 
16. 
In the present case, all the shareholders of the Petitioners have 
unanimously approved the scheme of merger. Since the scheme of 
merger has been approved unanimously, there is no reason to  
interfere with their business decision. Reliance is placed in the  
matter of International Complex Projects Limited and another  
(2017 CLD 1468) wherein the Court has held that where a scheme of 
arrangement was found to be reasonable and fair, at such juncture, it 
was not duty or province of the Court to supplement or substitute its 
judgment against collective wisdom and intellect of all shareholders 
of the company involved. 
17. 
The Court cannot, therefore, undertake the exercise of 
scrutinizing the Scheme placed for its sanction with a view to finding 
out whether a better scheme could have been adopted by the parties. 
So far as the exchange ratio of equity shareholders and the transferee-
company is concerned, the Court held that the valuation of shares is a 

 
Civil Original No.04 of 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 
technical and complex problem which can be appropriately  
left to the consideration of experts in the field of accountancy. 
Reliance is placed in the matter of Gadoon Textile Mills and others 
(2015 CLD 2010), where the Court has held that “businessmen had to 
take decision considering all the pros and cons of demerger and 
merger of companies. While taking such decision there would be 
chances of success and failure but while questioning such decision the 
bona fides was the real test. Businessmen could take decision 
foreseeing the future aspect. The Court could only see that all the 
legal formalities had been fulfilled and scheme was neither unjust nor 
unfair or against the national interest but could not challenge the 
wisdom of a decision of businessmen”. 
18. 
Being a sanctioning Court, the Court has noticed that all 
indispensable statutory benchmarks, requirements and formalities 
have been accomplished and adhered to by the Petitioners as 
envisioned under the relevant provisions of the law, including the 
holding/convening of the requisite meetings as contemplated under 
the relevant provisions, and the resolutions passed by the members 
have already been highlighted. The scheme set up for sanction has 
been reinforced and fortified by the requisite majority which decision 
seems to be just and fair. The report/minutes of meetings 
unequivocally 
convey 
that 
all 
essential 
and 
fundamental 
characteristics and attributes of the Scheme were placed before the 
voters at the concerned meetings to live up to statutory obligations. 
The proposed scheme is not found to be violative of any provision of 
law and/or contrary to public policy but as a whole looks like 
evenhanded and serviceable from the point of view of a prudent man 
of business taking a commercial decision beneficial to the class 
represented by him for whom the Scheme is meant. As explained in 
the above case precedents, once the requirements of a scheme for 
getting sanction of the Court are found to have been met, the Court 
will have no further jurisdiction to sit in appeal over the commercial 
wisdom of the majority of the class of persons who with their open 
eyes have given their approval of the Scheme. There does not remain 
any objection to the scheme of arrangement and no mistake, 

 
Civil Original No.04 of 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 
conspicuous, detectable shortcoming or flaw has further been pointed 
out in the present matter before me. This Court has already allowed 
various mergers recently on the basis of consideration mentioned 
above, in “ROOMI FOODS PVT LTD Versus JOINT REGISTRAR 
OF COMPANIES” (2020 CLD 900), “MS FAZAL CLOTH MILLS 
Ltd Versus MS FAZAL WEAVING MILLS Ltd” (2021 CLD 182), 
“PRESSON DESCON INTERNATIONAL PVT LIMITED etc. Versus 
JOINT REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES” (2020 CLD 1128 = PLD 
2020 Lahore 869) and “DILSONs (Private) Limited and others 
Versus Security & Exchange Commission of Pakistan and another” 
(2021 CLD 1317 Lahore) by holding that where a scheme of 
arrangement is found to be reasonable and fair, it is not duty or 
province of the Court to supplement or substitute its judgment against 
collective wisdom and intellect of all shareholders of the company 
involved. Reliance is also placed in the matter of NADEEM POWER 
GENERATION (PVT.) LTD. and another (2023 CLD 652) whereby 
the Court held that “it appears that the petitioners completed all 
necessary legal formalities, including holding separate meetings of 
shareholders and board of directors, requisite publication and 
issuance of notices to the Securities and Exchange Commission of 
Pakistan. In terms of such meetings of the board of directors and 
shareholders to the extent it is applicable and report pertaining to 
such meetings are available on record and not a single shareholder of 
any of the two petitioners objected to the scheme. Copy of letter of 
Pakistan Stock Exchange to such merger and that of swap ratio 
calculation issued by the Chartered Accountants are available on 
record. The publication of the instant petition was effected in Daily 
'Dunya and 'Business Recorder' of Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad in 
their issue of 03.01.2022 and was also gazetted. It is settled principle 
of law that the approach is channelized to ascertain (i) whether the 
statutory requirements were complied with and (ii) to determine 
whether the scheme as a whole has been arrived at by the majority, 
bona fide and the interest of whole body of shareholders in whose 
interest the majority purported to act and (iii) whether scheme is such 
that fair and reasonable shareholder will consider it to be for the 

 
Civil Original No.04 of 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13 
benefit of the company for himself. In the instant case no objection of 
whatsoever from any quarter has come forward while all the requisite 
formalities have been fulfilled hence no exception could be taken”. 
Moreover, in the matter of CHANCELLOR MASTERS AND 
SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD AND OXFORD 
UNIVERSITY 
PRESS 
PAKISTAN 
(SMC-PRIVATE) 
LIMITED  
(2023 CLD 1111), the Court held that “the "reasons" for this transfer 
and benefits have never been considered for a judicial review as it is 
their wisdom, which cannot be challenged. Only thing which is 
important for the court to see is whether this merger is lawful and has 
undergone the requirement of law. The Scheme of Arrangement under 
consideration as such stands approved as has been done by the 
petitioners and the creditors, which seems to be fair and reasonable 
and is not found against public or any individual's interest. All 
financial and other related information including last audited 
accounts and unaudited accounts of the petitioners have been 
disclosed and no investigation proceedings claimed to have  
been pending before any forum including SECP”. Likewise, in the 
matter 
of 
SPI 
INSURANCE 
COMPANY 
LIMITED 
AND  
THE UNITED INSURANCE COMPANY OF PAKISTAN LIMITED 
(2023 CLD 1088), the Court held that “it is settled principle of law 
that the approach is channelized to ascertain (i) whether the statutory 
requirements were complied with and (ii) to determine whether the 
scheme as a whole has been arrived at by the majority, bona fide and 
the interest of whole body of shareholders in whose interest the 
majority purported to act and (iii) consider it to be for the benefit of 
the company for himself. In the instant case no objection of 
whatsoever from any quarter has come forward while all the requisite 
formalities have been fulfilled hence no exception could be taken. To 
understand the concept of question, it is rather to be seen from the 
perception that a wise group of businessmen has taken a decision 
considering all its pros and corns. While taking such decision there 
are chances of success and failure but then while questioning such 
decision the bona fide is the real litmus test. A businessman takes 
decision foreseeing the future aspect. The Court could only see that 

 
Civil Original No.04 of 2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 
all legal formalities have been fulfilled and that the scheme is neither 
unjust nor unfair or against the national interest but cannot challenge 
the wisdom of a decision of businessman as by doing that the Court 
would be overriding the wisdom of a businessman and their

By examining Sections 279 to 283 of the “Act”, it has 
established like mid-day-sun that all legal/statutory requirements qua 
holding of meetings by the Chairmen, requisite publication, issuance 
of notices to the “SECP” and “CCP”, filing of NOCs of all secured 
creditors, interest of whole body of shareholders and approval of the 
“Scheme” by majority of shareholders which ultimately will prove to 
be beneficial for the shareholders and the companies itself, and the 
dictums laid down in aforesaid judgments, there remains no 
impediment to grant sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement of the 
Petitioners. Accordingly, this petition is allowed and the Scheme 
attached at Annex-G is hereby sanctioned and approved in terms 
thereof.
