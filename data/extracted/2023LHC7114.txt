Mahar Haseeb Qadir, Advocate with the petitioner. 
Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad Chohan, Assistant Advocate 
General Punjab with Munawar, Inspector. 
Rasheed Ahmad, respondent No.3 in person. 
 
Through this petition filed in terms of the Article 199 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 read 
with section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, the 
petitioner namely Mst. Arzu has sought the custody of her 
minor son namely Muhammad Ans. 
2.     In compliance of the order dated 05.09.2023, the minor 
namely Muhammad Ans has been produced before the Court by 
Rasheed Ahmad, respondent No.3, who had gained the custody 
of the minor namely Muhammad Ans by way of adoption. 
3. 
A perusal of the record and facts and circumstances 
reveals that the minor namely Muhammad Ans was put up for 
adoption and he was adopted by Rasheed Ahmad (respondent 
No.3) and started to live with him. During the course of events, 
the instant petition was filed by the petitioner namely Mst. Arzu 
who claimed herself to be the biological mother of Muhammad 
Ans and sought his custody. In order to resolve the controversy 
between the parties, this Court passed an order in the connected 
matter bearing Writ Petition No.11308 of 2023 titled Nasir 
Raza versus Additional Sessions Judge and two others that the 
maternity of the minor child namely Muhammad Ans be got 
determined as it was the paramount question to decide the 
matter. In this regard, the SHO Police Station Tulamba, District 
Khanewal (respondent No.2) was directed to take the petitioner 

W.P. No.12826  of 2023

and Muhammad Ans to Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore with an application for the determination of the 
maternity of the minor child and the Director Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore was directed to prepare and submit a 
detailed report in this regard. The said report of Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore with regard to the determination of the 
maternity of Muhammad Ans is now available. According to 
the said report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, the 
conclusion, which has been drawn after the DNA Analysis, is 
that the minor namely Muhammad Ans is the biological 
child of the petitioner namely Mst. Arzu. The report of the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore has been made part of 
the record of the instant case . With the increased rate of 
adoption in the Muslim world especially in Pakistan, the 
adoption issue has taken the status of one of the sensitive 
issues. The concept of adoption has caught the attention of the 
general masses mainly due to the shift in the social paradigms 
and the Laws governing it, it can also be due to the rising 
interest of the European Immigrants adopting Pakistani 
children. The concept of adoption is not a new one. In Islam, 
there is no prohibition on adoption since it was found to be in 
the greater interest of humanity and also to the Muslim 
community of the world. Few glorious examples of adoption 
from Islamic history can be traced as the practice of adoption 
was the continuation of the prevalent custom in the Arab 
peninsula. 
• The Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) continued the practice by 
declaring Hazrat Zaid bin Harisa (R.T.A), who was a slave 
gifted to the Holy Prophet by His (P.B.U.H) wife Hazrat 
Khadija (R.T.A), as his adopted son and he was generally 
known as Zaid-bin-Muhammad (R.T.A). 
• The Holy Prophet (PBUH) ordained to hand over the 
daughter of Hazrat Hamza(R.T.A) in the custody of Hazrat 
Jaafar (R.T.A). 
• Hazrat Abu Huzifa Bin Atba bin Rabeea Bin Abd Shams 
(R.T.A), a companion of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) adopted 
one child Salim bin Ma'qal and gave his niece in Salim bin 
Ma'qal's wedlock. 
• The Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H), Himself was an orphan, and 
was adopted and raised by his uncle Hazrat Abu Talib. 
• The Holy Virgin Mary (P.B.U.H) was adopted by her uncle 
Holy Zakaria (P.B.U.H) as stated by the Holy Quran. 

W.P. No.12826  of 2023

• The Holy Moses (P.B.U.H) was adopted by Pharaoh and 
His wife Ayesha (R.T.A). 
In this modern era, the responsibility of the Adopted Children 
falls on the Society and the State, which work together for the 
welfare of its people, especially the children. Quran repeatedly 
emphasizes the good conduct for the upbringing of orphans as 
the rights of such orphan children have been made the duty of 
the society. 
         The Holy  Quran states:-
 
“And treat not the orphans with harshness. (93/9)” 
“Seest thou one who denies the Judgment (to come)? Then such 
is the (man) who repulses the orphan with harshness (107/1.2)” 
“And they (the righteous people)feed for the love of God the 
indigent, the orphan and the captive. (76/8)” 
“Those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans indeed eat 
up a fire into their own bellies, they will soon be enduring a 
blazing fire. (4:10)” 
“They ask thee what they should spend (in charity), say: whatever 
ye that is good, is for parents and kindred and orphans and those in 
want and for way farer. (2:215)” 
In the Holy Quran, apart from the names of the prophets, no 
other name of any individual has been mentioned except that of 
Hazrat Zaid Bin Haris (R.T.A), the adopted son of the Holy 
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) . However, it is to be taken into 
account that the word "yateem" in the Arabic language is not 
confined to the children who have lost their parents but also to 
the people without a guardian like widows or the disadvantaged 
children. The debatable issue in adoption not only involves 
getting the physical charge of the child but also determining the 
rights of such a child. The identity of the adopted child is a 
sensitive issue and a lot of debate has been done on that 
whether the adoptive parents should be declared or presumed to 
be the real parents of the adopted child for the sake of the 
Child's recognition in the society as well as in the official 

W.P. No.12826  of 2023

records. This issue can be further diverged by classifying the 
adopted children into the classes of children with known 
parentage and that of unknown parentage/abandoned children. 
As far as an adopted child of known parentage is concerned, 
according to Islamic  concept, he/she must be recognized 
through his /her natural biological parents, the evidence 
emerges from the following verses of the Quran; 
         “ Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his chest 
cavity, nor did he make your wives whom you subjected to 
Zihar, your mothers, nor did he make your adopted sons your 
(real) sons. That is (merely) a word uttered by your mouths. 
And Allah says the truth and He shows the (right) way.” (33/4) 
         “ Call them by (the name of) their (real) fathers; It more 
equitable in the sight of Allah. And if you do not know their 
fathers, then they are your brothers in faith and your friends. 
There is no sin on you in the mistake you make, but in that 
which you do with intention of your hear; and Allah is Most-
Forgiving, Very-Merciful.” (33/5) 
The above mentioned verses clearly distinguish between the 
adopted children of known as well as of unknown lineage. It 
clearly orders for relating the identity of the adopted children 
with their biological parents if known but for those with the 
unknown parentage, it permits, rather prescribes that they may 
be treated and identified as your brothers and associates. This 
issue of lineage was again emphasized in the last Sermon of the 
Holy Prophet (PBUH) in which he categorically warned that no 
one should change his lineage. The adoption of child has no 
legal effect in Shariah rather it is for emotional and 
psychological satisfaction. The adoptive parents may treat an 
adopted child as their natural child in the matters of love, 
affection and general behaviour. The adoption of a child with 
the purpose of providing shelter to him is virtuous and carries 
much reward for welfare of the Child but adoption in Islam has 
no legal consequence. The child should be attributed to the 
natural parents, and not to the father or mother who has adopted

him and marriage of adopted children with natural children of 
adoptive parents is not prohibited unless they relate to each 
other in a prohibited degree. In short, adoption does not create a 
new legal relationship which did not exist before adoption. 
According to the NADRA (National Database and Registration 
Authority) Registration procedure, the parentage of the adopted 
child with known parentage must be entered as that of 
natural/biological parents, whereas parentage of the children 
with unknown parentage can be entered with some fictitious 
names to avoid social stigmas but there must be evidence 
provided by the adoptive parents that the child is with unknown 
parentage to avoid any confusion or controversy over the rights 
or duties of the adopted child as a biological child. Until now no 
law in Pakistan addresses the issue of adoption. However, the 
process of adoption is carried out in the name of custody of the 
person of the child under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. 
The adoptive parents apply to the court under the provisions of 
the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 and in the case of a child 
with known parentage, make the biological parents of the child 
as respondent who usually give consenting statement in favour 
of the applicant, adoptive parent. Adoption has not been defined 
nor is recognized under the Succession Act, of 1925. 
Succession to the movable and immovable property of any 
intestate Pakistani is governed under the laws of Pakistan in 
terms of section 5 of the Succession Act, 1925. Degree of 
kindred is computed in the manner set out in the Schedule 1 to 
the Succession Act, 1925. The adopted child does not find any 
mention in the category of kindred upon whom the property of 
intestate upon his death may devolve. According to the 
succession laid down under the Succession Act, 1925, an 
adopted child is not an heir or kindred entitled upon intestacy to 
inherit the estate of his adoptive parent. Adoption under 
'Muslim Law' does not create any kindred relationship between 
the adopted child and adoptive parent whosoever. Therefore, 
this Court is left with no other option but to allow this petition

and to hand over the custody of Muhammad Ans to the 
petitioner namely Mst. Arzu, who has been determined to be 
the biological mother of the child namely Muhammad Ans. 
This Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under article 199 
of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
has to exercise parental jurisdiction   and   is not   precluded in 
any circumstance, from giving due consideration to the welfare 
of a minor and to ensure that no harm or damage comes to him 
physically or emotionally. There is no cavil that this Court is 
competent to entertain a habeas corpus petition under article 
199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973  and direct that a person in custody within its territorial 
jurisdiction be brought before it and satisfy itself that the said 
detenue is not being held in improper or illegal custody. 
However, the proceedings in the habeas corpus jurisdiction are 
summary in nature and this Court cannot conduct a detailed 
inquiry. The only and the paramount consideration for 
exercising the jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 must be the welfare 
of the child. The basic consideration always is to provide the 
child with the most natural, most considerate and most 
compassionate atmosphere to grow up as a better member of the 
society. The term hidhana in Arabic is derived from the root 
hadhana which in Arabic means "the distance between the 
armpits to the loins", "the chest and the two arms and what 
includes in between", that can be summed up as "embrace". 
Accordingly, the word hidhana, which can grammatically be 
either infinitive or noun, means, "to clasp the baby to one's 
breast", "to nurture the baby", "to embrace the baby", which 
can be viewed as a synonym to "nursing" and "wet nursing". In 
Islamic jurisprudence, the term hidhana is used in its lexical 
meaning and it does not have a new meaning (legal reality), as 
some believe. Thus, using the word wilaya in the meaning of 
"guardianship" for the definition of hidhana would not be 
correct. Hidhana (custody) can literally be said to mean “to 

W.P. No.12826  of 2023 
7 
 
embrace or hug” and in the Shari’a, it means “raising or 
bringing up of a child”. Hidhana is a form of guardianship 
which women are more suitable to assume because they are 
more experienced in the area of looking after children and they 
are generally more caring and compassionate.  When it comes 
to the care of a minor child, the legal definitions can be 
confusing.  Many people conflate custody with guardianship 
while the two terms describe very different things.  There exists 
a distinction between guardianship and custody.  Under sections 
4(2), (S), 9(i) and 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act 1890, 
“guardianship” and “custody” are not held   to be   synonymous   
terms.   It is   observed   that “guardian” as defined in S. 4(2) 
means a person providing de facto or de jure care of the person 
or property of a minor. Such a person may or may not have the 
custody of a minor. Custody describes a parent’s care of a child, 
whereas legal guardianship is granted to someone who is not 
necessarily the child’s biological parent. Muslim Law, which 
gives the right of hizanat to the mother, has to be presumed to 
have considered it to be in the interest of the welfare of such a 
minor child to remain in the custody of his mother. It is true 
that a Guardian Court is the final arbitrator to adjudicate upon 
the question of custody of child but this does not mean that in 
exceptional cases when a person, has no remedy to regain the 
custody pending adjudication by the Guardian Court. In 
exceptional cases where the High Court finds that the interest 
and welfare of the minor demanded that the minor be 
committed immediately to the custody of his biological mother, 
the Court can pass an appropriate order under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 directing 
the custody of a minor to the biological mother as an interim 
measure pending final decision by the Guardian Court. Reliance 
is placed on the cases of “Mirjam Aberras Lehdeaho v. S.H.O., 
Police Station Chung, Lahore and others” (2018 SCMR 427), 
“Ahmed Sami and 2 others v. Saadia Ahmed and another” 
(1996 SCMR 268) “Shaukat Masih v. Mst. Farhat Parkash and 

W.P. No.12826  of 2023 
8 
 
others”(2015 SCMR 731), “Muhammad Khalil-ur-Rehman v. 
Mst. Shabana Rahman and another” (PLD 1995 SC 633) and 
“Mst. Nadia Perveen v. Mst. Almas Noreen and others” (PLD 
2012 SC 758).

In view of the above discussion, this petition is 
allowed and the custody of Muhammad Ans is ordered to be 
handed over to the petitioner, his biological mother. It has 
been brought to the notice of the Court that respondent No.3 
intends to file application/applications under the Guardians and 
Wards Act, 1890  seeking to be appointed as a guardian of the 
minor and have his custody. It is, therefore, directed that if and 
when such application/applications is/are filed by the 
respondent No.3, the competent forum shall decide the same 
strictly in accordance with the law and expeditiously, preferably 
within a period of two months of the filing of the same. It is also 
directed that the petitioner shall produce the minor before the 
competent forum if, as and when directed by the said forum so 
as to allow Rasheed Ahmad (respondent No.3), to meet with the 
minor. However, Rasheed Ahmad (respondent No.3) shall not 
be allowed to take the minor out of the premises of the 
competent forum. It is also made clear that any such petition 
filed by respondent No.3 under the Guardians and Wards Act, 
1890 seeking to be appointed as a guardian of the minor namely 
Muhammad Ans, and have his custody, the same shall be 
decided on its own merits, without being influenced in any 
manner by any observation made in this order and strictly in 
accordance with the law.
