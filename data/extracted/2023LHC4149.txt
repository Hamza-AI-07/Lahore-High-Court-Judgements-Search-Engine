MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.: Through 
instant petition, petitioner has called into question vires of order / 
letter dated 12.11.2021, issued by Government of the Punjab, 
Higher Education Department, whereby petitioner was held 
disentitled to get age relaxation in terms of Rule 3(v) of the Punjab 
Civil Servants Recruitment (Relaxation of Upper Age Limit) Rules, 
1976 (“Rules of 1976”). 
 
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that name of 
petitioner for the post of Registrar was recommended by the Search 
Committee twice but these recommendations were neither 
forwarded to the Syndicate of respondent-university nor petitioner 
was appointed. Adds that petitioner is entitled to be given benefits 
of the Rules of 1976 but the same are not being extended without 
any lawful justification. Further submits that petitioner is being

Writ Petition No.77143 of 2021 
subjected to gross discrimination in the matter as a candidate one 
year older than petitioner (appearing at Sr.No.3 of the list of 
candidates for the post of Controller of Examination) has been 
recommended. 
 
3. 
Learned Legal Advisor for respondent-university contends 
that respondent-university advertised the posts including the post of 
Registrar by following the terms & conditions / criteria set by 
Government of the Punjab, Higher Education Department vide 
Notification dated 23.02.2021 and after conducting the interview, 
recommendation of the Search Committee of three candidates 
(petitioner at Sr.No.1) was forwarded to Chancellor through 
respondent No.1, therefore, instant writ petition is not maintainable 
against respondent-university. 
 
4. 
Learned Law Officer submits that Rule 3(v) of the Rules of 
1976 is applicable to civil servants and does not apply to university 
employees.  
 
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
 
6. 
Perusal of record shows that initially the respondent-
university advertised the posts of Registrar (BPS-19) and Controller 
of Examinations (BPS-19) in Daily Nawa-i- Waqt on 02.09.2019 
and after conducting the interview by the Search Committee, a 
panel of three candidates for the post of Registrar, wherein 
petitioner’s name was at Sr.No.1, was submitted to the respondent 
No.1 / Higher Education Department, Government of the Punjab for 
approval of the Chancellor but the same was not materialized by the 
respondent No. 1. In the meanwhile, a uniform criteria for the post 
of Registrar, Controller of Examinations &Treasurer was notified 
and circulated vide Notification dated 23.02.2021 after getting 
ascent from the Chancellor. Accordingly, the respondent-university 
again advertised the posts including the post of Registrar (BPS-20). 
After conducting the interviews by the Search Committee in its 
meeting held on 13.07.2021 for the position of Registrar (BPS-20), 
three candidates including petitioner at Sr.No.1 were recommended 

3 
Writ Petition No.77143 of 2021 
and forwarded to the Chancellor through respondent No. 1 vide 
letter dated 16.07.2021 for the approval of the Chancellor, pursuant 
thereto impugned letter was issued.  
 
7. 
The stance of respondent-Higher Education Commission is 
that petitioner was over-age for about 06 years, 02 months & 21 
days, however general age relaxation for 05-years was granted to 
petitioner but still he was over-age for about 01 year, 2 months & 
21-days. Whereas the version of petitioner is that he had already 
served as Registrar in respondent-university for more than 05 years 
and after excluding said period, he is well within prescribed upper 
age limit. The dispute is regarding applicability of Rule 3(v) of the 
Rules of 1976, which reads as under:- 
 
v) 
In the case of a candidate already working as a Government 
servant, the period of his continuous service as such shall for the 
purpose of upper age limit prescribed under any service rules, of the 
post for which he is a candidate, be excluded from his age.  
 
 
 
The Rules of 1976 have been framed by the Governor of the 
Punjab by deriving authority from section 23 of the Punjab Civil 
Servants Act, 1974 and are applicable to the recruitment of all 
posts. The afore-referred Rule specifically provides that period of 
continuous service of a Government servant shall be excluded while 
computing upper age limit. The above Rule does not specifically 
provide that it would apply to civil servants rather it is providing 
benefit to Government servants. Had the Rules making authority 
intended to extend benefit of this Rule to ‘civil servants’ only, it 
could have used these words in explicit terms in the said Rule. The 
term ‘Government servant’ connotes all Government servants 
including civil servants and not vice versa. Reliance is placed upon 
Saleem-ur-Rehman 
and 
others 
v. 
Government 
of Punjab 
through Secretary, S&GAD, Lahore and others (1986 SCMR 
747), Punjab Government and others v. Saleem- ur-Rehman and 
others [1985 PLC (C.S.) 112] and Muhammad Iqbal 
v.

Writ Petition No.77143 of 2021 
Government 
of 
the 
Punjab through Secretary Education 
Schools, Punjab, Lahore and 4 others [2020 PLC(C.S.) 747]. 
 
8. 
Notification dated 23.02.2021 was issued by Government of 
the Punjab Higher Education Department after the approval of the 
Provincial Cabinet of the Punjab, which prescribed terms and 
conditions for the post of Registrar of Government College 
University and it specifically envisages that age for initial 
recruitment would be 40 to 50 years, with age relaxation as per 
Government Rules, leaving no room for respondent-Higher 
Education Commission to create any distinction or non-
applicability of the Rules of 1976. 
 
9. 
Needless to say that general age relaxation and exclusion of 
period served in Government employment for the purpose of 
computation of upper age limit are two separate and distinct 
benefits / rights awarded to Government employees including 
contract employment. These rights can be pressed into service by 
Government employees seeking further employment. Rules 3(v) of 
the Rules of 1976 is a beneficial dispensation and is to be 
interpreted in a manner so as to advance the remedy. Reliance is 
placed upon Muhammad Qasim and 6 others v. Home Department, 
Government of the Punjab through Secretary, Civil Secretariat, 
Lahore and 2 others [2004 PLC (C.S.) 69] and Saghir Ahmad 
Naqi v. Government of the Punjab through Secretary Home 
(Prisons) Department, Lahore and another [2005 PLC (C.S.) 
1409]. 
 
10. 
The Government College University, Faisalabad was 
constituted by way of the Government College University 
Faisalabad Ordinance, 2002 and the Governor of the Punjab is the 
Chancellor of the University.  The Syndicate of the university 
includes – the Vice Chancellor (Chairperson), the Secretary to 
Government of the Punjab, Education Department, the Secretary to 
Government of the Punjab, Finance Department and the Secretary 
to Government of the Punjab, Law and Parliamentary Affairs

Department as Members. Autonomous Public Bodies are an 
emanation of the Government and are clearly a limb of the 
Government or even an agency of the State and recognized by and 
clothed with rights and duties, either by or under a Statute and 
thereby become extended arms of the Government. The employees 
of autonomous bodies are considered as officials serving in 
connection with the affairs of the Government and hence, can be 
stated to be in the service of Government i.e. Government servants.  
 
11. 
It is pertinent to mention here that under Rule 2(c) of the 
Punjab Government Rules of  Business, 2011, ‘Autonomous Body’ 
means a Body mentioned in Column No. 4 of the First Schedule 
while Rule 2(d) of the Punjab Government Rules of   Business, 2011 
states that “Business” means the work done by the Government. 
Similarly, Rule-3 deals with Allocation of Business and sub-rule 
(3) states that the business of the Government shall be distributed 
amongst several Departments in the manner indicated in the 
Second Schedule. The Government College University, Faisalabad 
has been mentioned as an Autonomous Body of the Higher 
Education Department, Government of Punjab in Entry No. (xiv) 
of Column No. 4 of the Serial No. 16 of the First Schedule. 
Moreover it is further mentioned at Serial No. 37 (xiv) under the 
Higher Education Department in the Second Schedule. So 
provision of higher education is business of the Government of 
the Punjab, which business is tasked to be performed by 
the 
Higher Education Department and the Government 
College University Faisalabad is the vehicle and tool through 
which 
such 
business 
of 
the 
Government 
is conducted. 
Furthermore, the Finance Department of the Government of Punjab 
is also obligated with financial supervision and oversight of the 
autonomous bodies (which includes the Government College 
University Faisalabad) as per Second Schedule. 
 
12. 
Nutshell of above discussion is that petitioner being 
Government employee is entitled for benefit of Rule 3(v) of the 

6 
Writ Petition No.77143 of 2021 
Rules of 1976 and refusal of such right is against law / rules and as 
such the petitioner has been discriminated. Resultantly, instant 
petition is allowed and impugned letter dated 12.11.2021 is 
declared to be illegal and without lawful authority. The 
recommendation of the Search Committee, vide letter dated 
16.07.2021 shall be processed and finalized as per law at the 
earliest.
