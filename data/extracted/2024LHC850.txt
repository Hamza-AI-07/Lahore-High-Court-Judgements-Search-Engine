Petitioners by 
Mr. Umar Farooq, Advocate.

RASAAL HASAN SYED, J. Petitioner in this 
constitutional petition has challenged order dated 
15.7.2023 of the learned Addl. District Judge, 
Lahore whereby application to summon the Record 
Keeper of Treasury Office, District Lahore along 
with the record regarding stamp-paper at serial No. 
409 dated 15.8.1998 issued by Muhammad Naeem,  
Stamp Vendor and for recording his statement as a 
court-witness, was allowed by setting aside the 
order dated 18.1.2023 of the learned Civil Judge, 
Lahore, while accepting the revision petition. 
2.  
Facts as will be relevant for disposal of 
this petition are that suit for specific performance 
titled Haji Ilam Din v. Ghulam Haider, etc. and 
another suit for specific performance and permanent

injunction titled Muhammad Hanif v. Noor 
Muhammad were instituted and are pending in the 
civil court in respect of land measuring 19 kanals 
and 16 marlas situated in Mauza Arainyan, Raiwind 
Lahore. Vide order dated 31.10.2019 both the suits 
were consolidated and consolidated issues were 
framed with the direction to the parties to file within 
seven days the list of witnesses and certificate of 
readiness to produce evidence. It is claimed that 
both the parties did not file list of witnesses after the 
framing of consolidated issues. On 20.1.2020 
petitioner and his witnesses appeared in court when 
objection was raised that list of witnesses was not 
filed and, therefore, their evidence could not be 
recorded.  An application was moved by the 
petitioner claiming that list of witnesses having 
already been filed before the consolidation of suits 
may be treated as list of petitioner’s witnesses or 
alternatively the petitioner may be allowed to 
furnish fresh list of witnesses on the basis of 
additional issues framed by the court. This 
application 
was 
declined 
vide 
order 
dated 
01.2.2020. The  order was challenged in revision 
which was also dismissed by the learned Addl.

District Judge vide order dated 29.4.2021. These 
two orders were challenged before this Court in writ 
petition No. 30927 of 2021 which too was 
dismissed on 01.7.2021. It is claimed that an 
application under Order XVI, C.P.C. was filed on 
24.10.2022 by defendant Nos. 3 to 9 (respondents 
herein) for summoning Record Keeper of Treasury 
Office, District Lahore along with record of stamp-
paper at serial No. 409 dated 15.8.1998 issued by 
Muhammad Naeem, Stamp Vendor which was 
opposed and declined by the learned Civil Judge 
vide order dated 18.1.2023. The respondents 
challenged the order in revision which was accepted 
by learned Addl. District Judge, Lahore vide 
impugned order dated 15.7.2023. 
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner mainly 
argued that the list of witnesses having not been 
filed after the framing of additional issues by the 
petitioner, the permission to summon the Record 
Keeper of the Treasury, at this stage, could not be 
permitted in the absence of any good or sufficient 
cause which having not been shown, the order of the 
learned Civil Judge declining the application was 
justified and that interference in revision by the 

 
 
 
 
       W.P. No.48863 of 2023  
 
               Page-4 
 
 
 
learned Addl. District Judge vide impugned order 
was contrary to the rule consistently laid by the 
superior courts in terms whereof any party to the 
suit could not summon a witness not named in the 
list of witnesses which needs to be filed within 
seven days from the framing of issues; unless 
permission is solicited from the court in terms of 
proviso to Rule 1 of Order XVI, C.P.C. by showing 
“good cause” which course having not been adopted 
in this case, the order of the learned Addl. District 
Judge in revision was unsustainable. It is added that 
the respondents being negligent in filing of the list 
of witnesses in time could not be allowed to by-pass 
the law and that the petitioner was not allowed to 
file list of witnesses after the framing of additional 
issues which order was sustained up to this Court 
and, therefore, the respondents could not be treated 
differently than treatment extended to the petitioner 
and that the rule of propriety demanded that the 
respondents should not have been permitted to 
summon the Record Keeper in the absence of any 
list of witnesses or “sufficient cause” for the delay 
in this context. Learned counsel relied on certain 
caselaw to emphasize that the superior courts while 

 
 
 
 
       W.P. No.48863 of 2023  
 
               Page-5 
 
 
 
considering the effect of Rule 1 of Order XVI, 
C.P.C. have consistently observed that the rule is 
mandatory and that no party can be taken by 
surprise and that the parties to a suit are under 
obligation to file a list of witnesses whom they want 
to summon through the process of court and in case 
of failure to do so the court is competent to grant 
permission 
for 
filing 
delayed 
list 
provided 
“sufficient cause” is established.  
4.        
Learned counsel for the respondents 
contrariwise submitted that the documents were 
duly relied upon in the list of reliance submitted in 
court under Order XIII, Rule 1, C.P.C. and Order 
VII, Rule 14, C.P.C. Referring to the certified 
copies of the list of reliance it was submitted that 
there was no element of surprise to the petitioner; 
rather the document was duly mentioned in the list 
of reliance. It was added that the petitioner 
Muhammad Akram himself appeared in the witness-
box, recorded his oral statement and produced 
agreement to sell dated 15.8.1998 purportedly 
executed by Noor Muhammad son of Imam Din in 
favour of the petitioner which is Exh.D-1 in the suit 
titled Muhammad Hanif v. Noor Muhammad, etc. 

 
 
 
 
       W.P. No.48863 of 2023  
 
               Page-6 
 
 
 
During cross-examination by the counsel for legal 
heirs of late Haji Ilam Din certain questions in 
regard to the agreement were put to Muhammad 
Akram petitioner who denied the same although he 
admitted that the stamp of Exh.D-1 bore serial No. 
409 but expressed lack of knowledge about the copy 
of the form No. 409. He also denied the report of 
the Treasury in respect of the stamp-paper of form 
No. 409. It was added that copy of the record of 
stamp-paper No. 409 dated 15.8.1998, purportedly 
agreement to sell in favour of Muhammad Akram 
son of Muhammad Shafi and report of Treasury of 
District Lahore dated 30.5.2019 showed that fraud 
was committed by the petitioner Muhammad Akram 
as the report was to the effect that the particulars of 
“register goshwara” for the year 1998 to 1999 when 
scrutinized revealed that stamp value of Rs. 10/- 
dated 15.8.1998  in favour of Ghulam Muhammad 
son of Shah Din resident of Lahore was entered. In 
view of the contradiction in the document provided 
by the petitioner, and its original entered in the 
stamp-paper goshwara, the respondent moved an 
application for summoning of the record of the 
Treasury Office, District Lahore in respect of entry 

 
 
 
 
       W.P. No.48863 of 2023  
 
               Page-7 
 
 
 
No. 409 dated 15.8.1998 issued by Muhammad 
Naeem, Stamp Vendor. Learned counsel submits 
that the contradictions in the two documents i.e. 
Exh.D-1 and the actual entries of endorsement in 
the record for sale of stamp will show that fraud was 
committed by the petitioner and that the stamp 
paper on which the agreement was prepared did not 
pertain to the petitioner and that the learned Civil 
Judge rejected the application without considering 
the objective of the application or noticing the 
material effect of the production of record on the 
fate of the case while the learned Addl. District 
Judge duly took into consideration the plea of the 
petitioner and rightly observed that the court had the 
jurisdiction  to call for the record if it is required to 
do justice and to determine the facts properly so as 
to reach the truth.         
5.  
Submissions made by learned counsel for 
the parties have been given due consideration. It 
appears that initially the suits were tried separately 
and 
evidence 
was 
recorded. 
After 
their 
consolidation list of witnesses in respect of 
additional consolidated issues was not filed. 
Petitioner appeared in the witness-box and produced 

 
 
 
 
       W.P. No.48863 of 2023  
 
               Page-8 
 
 
 
the agreement relied upon by him as Exh.D-1. 
Learned counsel for the respondent Nos. 3 to 7, the 
legal heirs of deceased Haji Ilam Din, put serious 
questions to the witness in respect of the stamp 
entry of Exh.D-1. In cross-examination he admitted 
that the stamp Exh.D-1 was prepared on stamp 
paper No. 409 but he showed his ignorance as to the 
form (copy of which was put to him) for supply of 
stamp Exh.D-1. On being asked about the report of 
the Treasury Department as regarded entries qua 
stamp No.409, the petitioner denied that the stamp 
No. 409 for issuance of stamp-paper was in the 
name of Ghulam Muhammad son of Shah Din. He 
also denied that the stamp was issued on 16.7.1998. 
Learned Addl. District Judge reversed the order of 
learned Civil Judge with the observation that the 
court was fully cognizant and had jurisdiction to 
summon any person as court-witness to receive 
evidence and allow the parties to produce the same 
so that complete justice could be done in the case. 
6.     
As regards the objection of Order XVI, 
Rule 1, C.P.C. to the effect that a party could not 
summon any person as a witness unless they are 
named in the list of witnesses which could be filed 

 
 
 
 
       W.P. No.48863 of 2023  
 
               Page-9 
 
 
 
within seven days, there is no cavil with the 
proposition. It is also true that proviso to Rule 1 of 
Order XVI, C.P.C. empowers the court to condone 
the default in filing the list of witnesses within 
seven days if “sufficient cause” or “good reason” is 
shown to exist. In this case perusal of the 
application for summoning of Record Keeper with 
record of Treasury shows that the application was 
not filed under any specific rule rather title of the 
application shows that it was filed under Order XVI 
read with section 151, C.P.C.  and all other enabling 
provisions of law while at paragraph 5 of the 
application it was stated that the Record Keeper of 
Treasury Office, District Lahore along with the 
relevant record of stamp-paper serial No. 409 dated 
15.8.1998 be summoned for recording statement as 
a court-witness. Same was the request in the prayer 
clause of the application. It is thus obvious that the 
production of the witness and the record was 
claimed as a court-witness which obviously meant 
that the provision of Rule 14 of Order XVI, C.P.C. 
was attracted which mandates that where the court 
at any time considers it necessary to examine any 
person other than a party to the suit and who is not 

 
 
 
 
       W.P. No.48863 of 2023  
 
               Page-10 
 
 
 
called as a witness by a party in the suit, the court 
may of its own motion cause such person to be 
summoned as a witness to give evidence or to 
produce any document in his possession, on a day to 
be appointed; and may examine such person as a 
witness or require him to produce such document. 
Rule 14-A of Order XVI, C.P.C. was inserted by the 
Lahore High Court Amendment which is to the 
effect that when a witness is summoned by the 
Court of its own motion under Rule 14 of Order 
XVI, C.P.C. their diet money, etc. will be paid by 
such party or parties as the Court may in its 
discretion, direct. It appears that the learned Civil 
Judge was simply persuaded by the fact that earlier 
an application was filed by the petitioner for 
permission to file a new list of witnesses after 
consolidation of suits which was declined vide order 
dated 01.2.2020, the order was affirmed in revision 
vide order dated 29.4.2021 by learned Addl. District 
Judge and also by this Court in W.P. No.30927 of 
2021 titled Muhammad Akram v. Noor Muhammad 
and others and, therefore, the respondent in this case 
should also decline to summon a witness not 
mentioned in the list, little appreciating that the 

 
 
 
 
       W.P. No.48863 of 2023  
 
               Page-11 
 
 
 
court itself had jurisdiction to allow any person’s 
statement or production of record even if the parties 
to the suit had not summoned such person or record 
and that the court can exercise its power to record 
the statement as a court-witness and, if need be, to 
allow production of evidence in rebuttal thereof. 
Learned Addl. District Judge did take note of this 
aspect of the matter which is reproduced for facility 
of reference: 
“… it is necessary to refer that court is 
competent to summon the witness 
keeping in view the importance and 
relevance of that piece of evidence so 
that justice could be done in the real 
sense and no one could be knocked out 
mere on technical ground. Stamp paper 
No. 409 dated 15.8.1998 is part of 
record, there, revision petitioner as 
alleged that it is a fake document, he 
produced the report of Record Keeper 
and want to summon him as a Court 
Witness so that the real fact could be 
unearth. It is sufficient to mention here 
that evidence proposed by the plaintiff is 
necessary to reach upon a just decision 
of the case. In such scenario the learned 
trial court has not properly appreciated 
the record as well as the relevant law on 
the subject and has committed material 
illegality as well as irregularity while 
passing the impugned order, therefore, 
the instant revision petition is accepted 
and the impugned order is set aside and 
accordingly 
the 
application 
for 
summoning of record keeper filed by 
revision petitioner stands accepted….”

7.  
Perusal of the stance of the respondent as 
to the document produced by the petitioner being 
fake; to cross-examine the petitioner in respect of 
Exh. D-1; and the evasive reply received would 
make it obvious that the material fact as to whether 
the document was genuine or not in view of the 
report, if allowed to come on record, will be 
necessary to reach the truth for doing justice to the 
parties. It is for this reason that Rule 14 of Order 
XVI, C.P.C. empowers the Court to summon any 
witness for recording his statement or produce any 
document if need be for the just and fair decision of 
the case even if the parties to the suit had failed to 
produce them in the court. It appears that the 
respondents being cognizant of the law, did not 
move the application under Rule 1 of Order XVI, 
C.P.C; rather the title of the application shows that 
it is under Order XVI read with section 151 C.P.C. 
and all other enabling provisions of law. Even 
otherwise if had no particular provision of law been 
quoted, the court will be fully empowered to 
determine as to which provision of law will 
attracted for the relief claimed in the application and 
mere fact that the prayer in the application was to 

 
 
 
 
       W.P. No.48863 of 2023  
 
               Page-13 
 
 
 
summon the witness for their statement and to 
produce record of Treasury as a court-witness was 
adequate to show that Rule 14 of Order XVI, C.P.C. 
will be attracted. In Zar Wali Shah v. Yousaf Ali 
Shah and 9 others (1992 SCMR 1778) it was 
observed to the effect that the courts have ample 
power to collect evidence and allow the party to 
produce the same so that complete and ultimate 
justice is done in the case and that concept of filling 
any lacuna cannot be recognized and applied in the 
Islamic system of jurisprudence which is being 
progressively applied to the Courts and Tribunals 
that are vested with the powers to receive evidence.  
In Mst. Sardar Begum v. Zulfiqar Ali (2016 CLC 
Note 127) it was observed to the effect that  the 
main object of Rules 1(2) and 14 of Order XVI, 
C.P.C. was that the entire evidence which was 
relevant and necessary for ascertaining truth and 
deciding the issues involved completely and 
effectively should come before the court at the stage 
of trial while passing judgment and that merely on 
the pretext of non-submission of list of witnesses 
and non-mentioning of names of witnesses in the 
list of witnesses, the matter could not be thrown out 

 
 
 
 
       W.P. No.48863 of 2023  
 
               Page-14 
 
 
 
of arena of litigation because same could be due to 
inexperience or lack of understanding on part of the 
counsel which omission  amounted to “good cause”. 
Reference was made therein to the case of Agha 
Zahid Ali Hilali v. Muhammad Riaz and others 
(C.P. No.  1278 of 2013 decided on 23.9.2013) 
where it was observed as under: 
“It is not disputed on the record that 
examination of scribe and stamp vendor in the 
litigation on going between the parties is 
imperative for the just decision of the case. 
Yes, the respondents did not mention the 
names of these witnesses in their list of 
witnesses but when during the course of cross 
examination, it was; suggested to respondent 
No.1 by the counsel for the petitioners that he 
failed to prove the document by not examining 
the scribe and the stamp vendor, he after 
having been set on his guards, proceeded to 
move an application for summoning of the 
aforesaid witnesses. This shows that omission 
to summon the witnesses owes its origin to 
either in-experience or lack of understanding 
on the part of the counsel or the party. 
Omission of this type was a good cause to all 
intents and purpose” 
In the instant case the controversy was about the 
genuineness of the document produced as Ex.D-1 
which according to respondents was prepared on a 
stamp-paper issued for a different person. The 
decision on the question would of course be relevant 
and helpful in determining the issue between the 
parties.  It was  in these circumstances that the 
learned Addl. District Judge allowed the revision 

 
 
 
 
       W.P. No.48863 of 2023  
 
               Page-15 
 
 
 
petition to find out a truth for doing complete justice 
between the parties. 
8.  
As 
regards 
the 
argument 
that 
the 
petitioner’s application under Rule 1, Order XVI, 
C.P.C. was dismissed and on that such premise the 
application of respondents should also have been 
declined; there is no substance in this argument for 
the reason that in the petitioners’ case he was unable 
to show any “sufficient cause” for permission to file 
a List of Witnesses which was not filed earlier 
within seven days of the issues and no “sufficient 
cause” was shown to the satisfaction of the court. 
To the contrary in the instant case the respondents 
sought indulgence of the court for summoning the 
witness as a court-witness to find out truth and to do 
complete justice between the parties and the 
revisional court after considering this aspect, 
deemed it just and fair to allow the production of 
record; which was an official record of the Treasury. 
The reasons that sustained with the learned Addl. 
District Judge being just and fair no except could be 
taken thereto. As to the objection of extending equal 
treatment, of course, the witness being summoned 
as a court-witness to resolve the material 

 
 
 
 
       W.P. No.48863 of 2023  
 
               Page-16 
 
 
 
controversy and to dig out the truth, both the parties 
will be allowed to cross-examine such witness and, 
if need be, to allow the petitioners an opportunity of 
evidence in rebuttal. The petitioners shall, therefore, 
be fully protected. In view of the reasons supra the 
order of Addl. District Judge does not suffer from 
any error of law and jurisdiction and being based on 
rule of fair, just and complete justice, does not call 
for any interference.    
9.  
Resultantly, 
the 
instant 
constitutional 
petition being devoid of any substance is dismissed.
