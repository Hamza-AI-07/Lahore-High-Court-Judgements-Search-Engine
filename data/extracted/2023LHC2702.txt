Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. The petitioner is grandfather 
of respondent No.2, who instituted a suit for recovery of maintenance 
and dowry articles alongwith her mother (respondent No.1) against 
respondent No.5, who is son of the petitioner. Suit was decreed ex-
parte vide judgment dated 26th June, 2018 against which respondents 
No.1 and 2 (hereinafter referred to as “respondents”) preferred an 
appeal, which was partly accepted by way of judgment and decree 
dated 29th September, 2018. In order to get the fruits of the decree, the 
“respondents” filed an execution petition before the learned Judge 
Family Court, Ranala Khurd, who by way of its order dated 19th June, 
2019 proceeded to attach the property measuring 26-Kanal 7-Marla 
owned by the petitioner for the purpose of auction to get the decree 
satisfied. The petitioner objected the order, however, his objections 
were turned down. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner challenged the 
said order through an appeal before the learned Additional District 
Judge, Ranala Khurd but of no avail and the appeal was dismissed 
through judgment and decree dated 30th September, 2020, hence this 
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973.

2.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that no doubt 
petitioner is grandfather of respondent No.2 in whose favour a decree 
for maintenance was passed but the petitioner was not a party to the 
suit and as such decree cannot be executed against him. Learned 
counsel emphasized that even otherwise, grandfather cannot be 
burdened to pay the maintenance to the grand child in ordinary 
course. Learned counsel, while making reference to para 370 of 
Muhammadan Law by D.F. Mulla’s, submits that the executing Court 
has erred in law while passing an order of attachment of the property 
of the petitioner for the satisfaction of decree. Argued that the 
appellate Court has also erred in law by dismissing the appeal and the 
impugned judgment is not tenable. In order to supplement his 
contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on MUHAMMAD 
RAMZAN v. ALI HAMZA and others (PLD 2016 Lahore 622). 
3.  
Conversely, learned counsel for the “respondents” 
vehemently resisted the instant petition and submitted that the 
petitioner being grandfather is bound to maintain the respondent No.2 
and the executing Court was justified to attach his property for the 
satisfaction of the decree. Learned counsel contended that scope of 
writ jurisdiction is limited and as the findings of the Courts below are 
concurrent, so this petition is not maintainable. In order to 
supplement his contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on 
SULTAN AHMAD v. JUDGE FAMILY COURT and 5 others (PLD 
2012 Lahore 148). 
4.  
Heard. Record perused. 
5.  
Suit for recovery of maintenance and dowry articles was 
instituted by the “respondents” against respondent No.5, who is son 
of the petitioner. Suit was ultimately decreed ex-parte vide judgment 
dated 26th June, 2018, which was modified by the learned Additional 
District Judge in appeal filed by the “respondents” by way of 
judgment dated 29th September, 2018. In order to get the decree 
satisfied, the “respondents” filed the execution petition before the 
learned Judge Family Court. During the proceedings warrant of 
arrest of respondent No.5 (judgment debtor) was issued but on 

3 
                  W.P.No.52429 of 2020 
 
 
 
account of non-satisfaction of the decree, the executing Court 
proceeded to attach the property of the petitioner by way of order 
dated 19th June, 2019 while observing as under: - 
“2. 
In such like situation, decree particularly of 
maintenance allowance of wife as well as children cannot be left 
unattended and court has to see the alternate way to execute the 
decree if possible. In instant case as contended by decree holder 
No.1, grandfather of minor has property measuring 26-Kanals 
07-Marlas, which shows that he having immovable property is in 
easy circumstances. It was imperative upon grandfather of 
minor/real father of judgment debtor to provide maintenance 
allowance to his grandchildren but he failed to do so. Decree 
holder No.2 specially minor, cannot be left unattended in a case 
of recovery of maintenance allowance. Moreover Family Court 
has extensive powers to adopt any procedure to execute the 
decree. It is also held by superior courts in numerous judgments 
that in case of infirmity/disability or having meager sources of 
income to provide maintenance allowance to the children by real 
father/judgment debtor, grandfather is liable to provide 
maintenance allowance to his grandchildren. So in this view of 
the matter, grandfather is liable to satisfy the decree. As 
grandfather has denied to satisfy the decree by filing written 
reply, therefore, this court has no way except to proceed against 
his property as mentioned in Fard Taliqa which is hereby 
attached….” 
Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner challenged the said order through an 
appeal before the learned Additional District Judge, Renala Khurd 
but his appeal was dismissed through impugned judgment.  
6.  
The status of the petitioner being grandfather of respondent 
No.2 is not in dispute. There is also no denial to the fact that the 
petitioner was never party to the suit. There is no cavil that in terms of 
para 370 of Muhammadan Law by D.F Mulla’s, a grandfather in 
certain circumstances is bound to maintain his grandchildren but 
obligation of the grandfather to maintain his grandchildren is hedged 
with certain conditions. In order to understand the matter in issue in 
better terms, para 370 of Muhammadan Law by D.F. Mulla’s is 
reproduced below: - 
“370.Maintenance of children and grandchildren (1) A 
father is bound to maintain his sons until they have attained the 
age of puberty. He is also bound to maintain his daughters until 
they are married. But he is not bound to maintain his adult sons 
unless they are disabled by infirmity or disease. The fact that the 
children are in the custody of their mother during their infancy 
(section 352) does not relieve the father from the obligation of 
maintaining them. But the father is not bound to maintain a 
child who is capable of being maintained out of his or her own 
property. 

4 
                  W.P.No.52429 of 2020 
 
 
 
(2) 
If the father is poor, and incapable of earning by 
his own labour, the mother, if she is in easy circumstances, is 
bound to maintain her children as the father would be. 
(3). 
If the father is poor and infirm, and the mother 
also is poor, the obligation to maintain the children lies on the 
grandfather, provided he is in easy circumstances.”  
(Underlining supplied for emphasis.) 
From the bare perusal of the above referred para, it is manifestly 
clear that primarily it is the father who is bound to maintain his 
children, in case of son(s) until he (they) attain(s) the age of puberty 
and if there are daughters, till their marriage. In case, the father is 
poor and incapable of maintaining by his own, the mother would come 
into picture and if she is in easy circumstances, she would be bound to 
maintain her children in place of father. The liability of grandfather 
though starts when the father is poor and infirm and the mother is 
also not in a position to provide maintenance to her children but such 
liability of grandfather is dependent upon the fact that he should be in 
easy circumstances. In order to saddle the grandfather with the 
liability to pay maintenance to the grandchildren, it is thus imperative 
to first determine that father of the children is poor and infirm and 
mother is also having no source of income coupled with the fact that 
grandfather is in easy circumstances. The determination of such 
question cannot be made unless grandfather is a party to the suit 
having a fair opportunity to explain his status and position. Reliance 
in this respect can be placed on Haji NIZAM KHAN v. ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT JUDGE, LYALLPUR AND OTHERS (PLD 1976 Lahore 930). 
7.  
So far judgment in the case of SULTAN AHMAD v. JUDGE 
FAMILY COURT and 5 others supra is concerned, it is observed that 
from the facts and circumstances of the case, it is evident that 
judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of GHULAM 
NABI versus MUHAMMAD ASGHAR and 3 others (PLD 1991 
Supreme Court 543) was not brought in the notice of the Court and as 
such it would not have any binding effect. For the purpose of clarity, 
the relevant extract from the judgment in GHULAM NABI (supra) is 
reproduced below: - 

5 
                  W.P.No.52429 of 2020 
 
 
 
“Although leave was not granted to examine this point we 
permitted the learned counsel to advance the same so as to clarify 
the legal position. No doubt grandparents, if affluent, will be 
obliged to maintain grand children if they are destitute. But the 
command would issue in this behalf when there is no other 
nearer relation and/or more responsible in this behalf. 
Accordingly, when a specific proposition was put to the learned 
counsel in this behalf he could not advance his argument any 
further. The question posed was: whether, in presence of the 
father the grandparents, whether on the paternal or on the 
maternal side, will be more responsible for maintaining their 
grandchildren as compared to the father's duty to maintain his 
own children learned counsel without hesitation admitted that 
the priority-wise it would be the duty of the father.” 
8.  
In somewhat similar facts and circumstances, in the case of 
MUHAMMAD RAMZAN supra, this Court held as under: - 
“5. 
….From the bare perusal of principles embodied in Para 
370 ibid it is crystal clear that primarily father is bound to 
maintain his children. In the case of son until he or they attain 
the age of puberty and if there are daughter or daughters till 
their marriage. In case the father is poor and incapable of 
earning by his own labour it is the mother, if she is in easy 
circumstances, to maintain her children. The liability of 
grandfather starts when the father is poor and infirm and the 
mother is also not in a position to provide maintenance to her 
children but the liability of grandfather to maintain his 
grandchildren, is also dependent upon the fact that he is in easy 
circumstances. Thus in my humble view if the father and mother 
are alive, the grandfather cannot be held responsible for 
maintenance of his grandchildren unless it is first determined 
that he is in easy circumstances. In order to determine that 
grandfather is in a position to maintain his grandchildren it is 
incumbent upon the Family Court to first adjudicate and 
determine this fact which cannot be done unless he is a party to 
the suit, having a fair opportunity to explain his status and 
position.” 
From the bare reading of the above, there remains no cavil to the 
proposition that prime duty to maintain the children lies with the 
father and grandfather cannot be asked to pay maintenance to 
grandchildren in an omnibus fashion.  
9.  
As already observed that the petitioner was even not party 
to the suit, so law to this effect is well-settled that a decree cannot be 
executed against a person, who is alien to the proceedings with only 
one exception as ordained in section 145 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure (V of 1908) where a decree can be enforced in certain 
conditions against a surety/guarantor. It is an oft repeated principle 
of law that executing Court cannot go beyond the decree. It is, thus, 
apparent from the record that executing Court proceeded to attach the 

6 
                  W.P.No.52429 of 2020 
 
 
 
property of the petitioner in oblivious of the well-settled principles of 
law, which order was even affirmed by the appellate Court without 
due application of judicious mind to the facts of the case. Guidance in 
this respect can be sought from MUHAMMAD YAQOOB v. 
ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, KHARIYAN DISTRICT GUJRAT 
and 3 others (2017 YLR Note 360). The relevant extract from the 
same is reproduced below: - 
“5. 
It is established from the record that the petitioner 
was not party in the suit. It is also established from bare perusal 
of the execution petition that the same was filed against 
Muhammad Nasir, judgment-debtor. It is also established from 
the record that no decree has been passed against the petitioner. 
The petitioner never stood surety or guarantor on behalf of the 
judgment-debtor. The petitioner did not give any undertaking 
that in case his son (judgment-debtor) does not pay the decretal 
amount he will pay the same, therefore, decree could not be 
executed against the petitioner. The executing court has 
exceeded his jurisdiction by executing the decree against the 
petitioner who is the paternal grandfather of respondents No.3 
and 4. Reference may be made to the case law titled as 
"Muhammad Jameel v. Mst. Tahira Bibi and 4 others" (2013 
CLC 1529 (DB), "Muhammad Aslam v. Ayaz Ghazanfar and 2 
others" (PLD 2012 Lahore 392) and "Mst. Nasreen v. 
Government of Sind and 2 others" (PLD 1989 Karachi 28).” 
Reliance to this effect can also be made to SHAFQAT ULLAH and 2 
others v. LAND ACQUISITION COLLECTOR (D.C.), HARIPUR and 
2 others (2006 CLC 1555).  
10.  
It evinces from the bare reading of the order resulting into 
attachment of the property of the petitioner that the executing Court, 
while feeling helpless from the situation, opted to choose the 
petitioner for the satisfaction of the decree as the respondent No.5 
(judgment debtor) was fugitive from law. Needless to observe that 
section 13 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 prescribes the modes for the 
enforcement of decree, which reads as under: - 
  
13.    Enforcement of decrees.– (1) The Family Court 
shall pass a decree in such form and in such manner as may be 
prescribed, and shall enter its particulars in the prescribed 
register. 
(2)  If any money is paid or any property is delivered in the 
presence of the Family Court, in satisfaction of the decree, it shall 
enter the fact of payment [or] the delivery of property, as the case may 
be, in the aforesaid register. 
(3)  Where a decree relates to the payment of money and 
the decretal amount is not paid within time specified by the Court 
[not exceeding thirty days, the same shall, if the Court so directs 

7 
                  W.P.No.52429 of 2020 
 
 
 
be recovered as arrears of land revenue, and on recovery shall be 
paid to the decree-holder. 
(4)  The decree shall be executed by the Court, passing it or 
by such other Civil Court as the District Judge may, by special or 
general order, direct. 
(5)  A Family Court may, if it so deems fit, direct that any 
money to be paid under a decree passed by it be paid in such 
installments as it deems fit. 
It is quite obvious from the above that the Family Court is vested with 
the power to execute its own decree for payment of money by adopting 
modes provided for recovery of arrears of land revenue including 
selling the property of judgment debtor. In the recent past in the case 
of Mst. AMMAN GUL V. LEARNED JUDGE FAMILY COURT, 
RAWALPINDI and 2 others (Transfer Application No.31 of 2022), a 
larger Bench of this Court held as under: - 
“15. Part II of “C.P.C.” deals with the execution and it 
provides a detailed mechanism for the execution of decree passed 
by a court. Section 38 of the “C.P.C.” lays down that a decree 
may be executed either by the court which passed it, or by the 
court to which it is sent for execution. We are mindful of the fact 
that Section 13 of the “Act, 1964” neither provides detailed 
mechanism for the execution of decree nor caters all the 
eventualities arising from the execution proceedings. Sub-section 
(4) of Section 13 of “Act, 1964” places the Family Court and the 
Civil Court at the same pedestal for the purpose of execution of 
decree, so in that capacity a court “Family” or “Civil” enjoys all 
powers of the executing court vested in Part II as well as Order 
XXI of the “C.P.C.”. Section 39 of the “C.P.C.” deals with the 
transfer of decree which empowers the court who passed a decree 
to send it for execution to another court, on the application of the 
decree holder. We deem it appropriate to reiterate that once a 
decree is passed by the Family Court that becomes executable in 
terms of Section 13 and in case of any hindrance to the same, the 
learned executing court can adopt any of the mode provided for 
the execution of the decree in the “C.P.C.”.” 
11.  
After having a glimpse of the survey of law on the subject, I 
am of the firm view that Family Court can never be helpless to get its 
decree executed. The process of execution cannot shift towards the 
grandfather merely on the ground that decree could not be satisfied 
against the father (judgment debtor). The Family Court cannot 
assume the role of spectator rather it can adopt the procedure 
contained in “CPC” for the execution of the decree. 
12.  
The nutshell of above discussion is that in the 
circumstances, both the Courts have erred in law while proceeding 

8 
                  W.P.No.52429 of 2020 
 
 
 
against the petitioner for the satisfaction of the decree passed against 
respondent No.5 (judgment debtor). Resultantly, this petition is 
allowed. As a sequel thereof, impugned judgment dated 30th 
September, 2020 and orders dated 19th June, 2019 and 24th 
September, 2019 are set aside being illegal and unlawful leaving the 
executing Court to proceed against respondent No.5 (judgment 
debtor) for the satisfaction of the decree through any mode 
permissible under the law. No order as to costs.
