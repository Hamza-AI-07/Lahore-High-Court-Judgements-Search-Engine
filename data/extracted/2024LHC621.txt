Anwaar Hussain J: The petitioner instituted suit for specific 
performance of contract on the basis of an agreement to sell dated 
03.04.2008 (“the agreement”) against respondents No.3 to 12. 
Respondents No.3 to 10 are members of same family whereas 
respondent No.11 is Province of Punjab. Respondent No.12 is 
admittedly close relative (brother in law) of the petitioner, who also 
statedly entered into an agreement to sell with respondents No.3 to 10.  
When the suit was instituted on 12.03.2015, admittedly respondent 
No.5 was minor. The execution of the agreement was flatly denied by 
respondents No.3 to 10. Issues were framed and evidence of both 
sides have been admittedly recorded. The petitioner filed an 
application for comparison of thumb impression of respondents No.3 
to 10 on the agreement with their specimen/admitted thumb 
impressions, which was dismissed through order dated 15.09.2021, 
inter alia, on the ground that report of the finger expert is 
corroborative piece of evidence and the application has been filed by 
the petitioner at belated stage just to linger on the trial hence, the same 
cannot be allowed. Order dated 15.09.2021 has been upheld by the 
Revisional Court below, vide impugned order dated 08.11.2021.    
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that both the Courts 
below have erred by not appreciating the dicta laid down by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as “Syed Sharif ul Hassan 

 
 
 
2 
W.P No.993/2022 
 
 
through L.Rs. v. Hafiz Muhammad Amin and others” (2012 SCMR 
1258) while dismissing the application of the petitioner for 
comparison of thumb impression of respondents No.3 to 10 even 
though respondent No.4 while appearing as DW-1 agreed to the said 
comparison. He also places reliance on an unreported judgment of the 
Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.787 of 2017 titled as “Mst. Afzala 
Virks v. Mian Fazal Haq (decd) thr: L.Rs. & another” in support of 
his contentions. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondents No.3 to 10 submits 
that the suit instituted by the petitioner is not maintainable as the 
disputed land belongs to the Government of Punjab and proprietary 
rights had not been granted to respondents No.3 to 10 till date. Adds 
that even if it is established that the respondents have affixed their 
signatures and/or thumb impression on the agreement, the same is of 
no help to the petitioner as one of the respondents was a minor and a 
minor cannot enter into a valid agreement under the law in terms of 
Section 11 of the Contract Act, 1872. 
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
5. 
Admittedly, the suit property was allotted by the Government to 
predecessor-in-interest of respondents No.3 to 10 and after demise of 
said predecessor-in-interest, respondents No.3 to 10 are in occupation 
thereof. Therefore, without commenting upon the merits of the case 
lest it may prejudice the case of either side, it is well evident from the 
record that the suit was instituted by the petitioner on the basis of the 
agreement purportedly executed by respondents No.3 to 10, which 
includes respondent No.5, who was a minor at the time of execution 
of the agreement. The execution of the agreement was outrightly 
denied by respondents No.3 to 10. The case of the petitioner depends 
upon proving the agreement through which the suit property has 
allegedly been sold by respondents No.3 to 10 to the petitioner. It is 
noteworthy that the object for production of evidence is assistance to 
the Courts to reach a just conclusion. An application for comparison 
of thumb impression is one such mode. The only hinderance in not 

 
 
 
3 
W.P No.993/2022 
 
 
allowing the application could be if the plaintiff intended to fill in the 
lacunae of his case after the conclusion of evidence. In the instant 
case, the respondent side has failed to point out any such effort on part 
of the petitioner. There appears to be no harm to either side if 
comparison of thumb impression is made. In fact, the said exercise 
will be appropriate and in the interest of justice to reach a fair 
conclusion and render a just and proper decision, even at the cost of 
some delay in conclusion of the trial. For a Court of law, rendering a 
fair and just decision is more important than to act hurriedly by 
drawing a wrong conclusion. Mere fact that application for 
comparison of thumb impression has been moved at the stage when 
the entire evidence has been recorded is not a cogent reason to dismiss 
the application. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that no time has 
been stipulated in terms of Article 84 of the of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984 for filing the application of comparison of the signatures 
and/or thumb impression through expert. Case reported as “Ghulam 
Haider v. Fateh Muhammad (2005 MLD 1501) is referred in this 
regard. Moreover, it is the right of a litigant to seek indulgence of the 
Court so as to discharge the burden of proof placed upon him 
including comparison of the disputed thumb impressions. I am 
fortified by the law laid down in case reported as “Mst. Akhtar Begum 
v. Muslim Commercial Bank Ltd. (2009 SCMR 264). In case of Mst. 
Akhtar Begum supra while sending the signatures of the petitioner 
therein for expert opinion in the said case, the Supreme Court held 
that it is the right of a party to seek and demand every possible 
assistance from the Courts of law and to hold him/herself responsible 
only when he or she has acted contrary to law. 
6. 
Moreover, when the evidence was recorded, respondent No.4, 
namely, Muhammad Irshad, appeared as DW-1 and candidly 
conceded that they (respondents) have no objection if their 
(respondents No.3 to 10) signatures are sent to the finger expert for 
comparison. Both the Courts below have ignored this aspect of the 
case as well. In order to ensure that correct conclusion is reached in 
the matter, the Court can look around for an evidence of un-

 
 
 
4 
W.P No.993/2022 
 
 
impeccable caliber such as finger expert, more particularly, when 
there is a complete denial on part of the respondents/defendants that 
they have not affixed their thumb impression on the agreement. It is in 
the interest of justice that the petitioner be allowed to prove his stance 
by having recourse to the forensic science/handwriting expert. Dicta 
laid down by the Supreme Court in case of Syed Sharif ul Hassan 
supra, supports the stance of the petitioner. Reliance on an unreported 
judgment in case of Mst. Afzala Virks supra is also well placed.     
7. 
In so far as the argument of learned counsel for respondents 
No.3 to 10 that allowing the petitioner to effect comparison of thumb 
impression of the respondents is likely to result into injustice in so far 
as respondent No.5, who was minor at the time of alleged execution of 
the agreement, is concerned, suffice to mention that even if it is 
proved that alleged thumb impression of respondent No. 5 on the 
agreement is genuine, the same will merely go on to prove (or 
otherwise) the execution of the agreement without having any bearing 
on the competency of the said respondent who was admittedly minor 
at the time of execution of the agreement as the competency to 
contract is a question of law and is to be decided by the Trial Court on 
the basis of applicable law and not on the basis of the report of the 
finger expert. Therefore, argument of learned counsel for respondents 
No.3 to 10 has no force.   
8. 
The matter can be examined from another angle. Had the 
petitioner failed to seek comparison of signature, through expert 
evidence, in the face of express and outright denial as to the execution 
of the agreement, the same may propel the Trial Court as also the 
higher forums to harbour adverse inference against the petitioner/ 
plaintiff. Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that non-acceptance of 
the application of comparison of thumb impression will lead to 
miscarriage of justice and thwart the Trial Court in reaching a just 
conclusion, which is not permissible under the law and will defeat 
ends of justice.

W.P No.993/2022 
 
 
9. 
In view of the above discussion, this constitutional petition is 
allowed and the impugned orders passed by the Courts below are set 
aside. As a consequence, application of the petitioner for conducting 
comparison of the thumb impression and/or signatures, of respondents 
No.3 to 10, is accepted.
