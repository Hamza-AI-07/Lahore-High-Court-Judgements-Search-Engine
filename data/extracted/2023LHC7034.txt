JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing: 
11.7.2023 
For the Petitioner: 
Malik Kashif Hussain, Advocate. 
For Respondent Nos.1 & 2: 
Mr Sanam Fareed Khan Baloch, Assistant 
Advocate General, with Khurram/SHO. 
For Respondent No.3: 
Mr Asif Ali Chaudhary, Advocate. 
 
 
  
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Through this petition under Article 
199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973  
(the “Constitution”), the Petitioner sought recovery of her mentally 
disordered brother, Syed Qadeer Abbas, from the alleged illegal custody of 
Respondents No.3 to 8. She alleged that they wanted to grab his 19 kanals 
09 marlas land in Chak No.543/E.B. This Court issued notice to 
Respondents No.3 to 8 and directed the SHO, Police Station Machiwal, 
District Vehari, to produce Qadeer Abbas before it. 
2. 
 
The SHO has reported that Qadeer Abbas lived in Chak 
No.543/E.B. and has been missing for 4/5 years. In May 2022, the Petitioner 
applied to the Secretary Union Council No.16, Vehari, for the issuance of his 
death certificate stating that he died of natural causes at his home on 
15.05.2022, and was buried the same day. On 25.05.2022, the Secretary 
issued his computerized death certificate. On 14.06.2022, the Petitioner 
obtained the inheritance mutation regarding Qadeer Abbas’s estate, 
according to which he had left behind a sister (the Petitioner) and a brother, 
Murtaza Shah, among his legal heirs. As a result, out of the aforementioned 
land, 06 kanals 9-1/3 marlas fell in her share, while Murtaza Shah received 
the remainder. Two days later, on 16.06.2022, the Petitioner sold the 

Writ Petition No. 9075/2023 
 
- 2 - 
property so acquired to Waseem Ikram and two others for Rs.2,250,000/-. 
The SHO has further stated that Respondent No.4 opposes these 
transactions. He claims that on 05.10.2016 Qadeer Abbas executed a sale 
agreement with him about the land, so the Petitioner could not sell any 
portion of it to Waseem Ikram etc. Due to this conflict, he also lodged FIR 
No.185/2023 
dated 
25.02.2023. 
Respondent 
No.4 
challenged 
the 
aforementioned death certificate before the Assistant Director, Local 
Government & Community Development, Tehsil Vehari, who conducted an 
inquiry and found that it was fraudulent. Consequent thereupon, he ordered 
its cancellation. The SHO has opined that the Petitioner had filed the instant 
petition with ulterior motives to pressurize Respondents No.3 to 8 to 
withdraw from criminal litigation. He has submitted supporting 
documentation for his report. 
3. 
 
I have confronted the Petitioner’s counsel with the SHO’s 
report and the documents appended therewith, particularly the death 
certificate of Qadeer Abbas dated 25.05.2022, which was issued on the 
Petitioner’s application, but he could not refute them. 
4. 
 
The Petitioner has filed this constitutional petition on fallacious 
and misleading assertions and submitted a false affidavit to support it. She 
has thus rendered herself to criminal prosecution. A false statement under 
oath is an offence under section 181 PPC while furnishing incorrect 
information with the intent to cause a public servant to use his lawful power 
to the detriment of another person is punishable under section 182 PPC. In 
addition, she is liable to legal action under the Contempt of Court Ordinance 
2003. The Supreme Court of India penalized a husband for contempt of 
court in Chandra Shashi v. Anil Kumar Verma [(1995) 1 SCC 421] for 
filing a forged document to oppose his wife’s motion for transfer of 
matrimonial proceedings. The Supreme Court ruled that anyone who 
commits fraud to deflect the course of legal proceedings or acts with an 
ulterior motive should be appropriately punished because he obstructs the 
administration of justice. This would deter others from engaging in similar 
practices that undermine public confidence in the legal system. The Supreme 
Court further stated: 

Writ Petition No. 9075/2023 
 
- 3 - 
“7. 
… Contempt jurisdiction has been conferred on superior courts not 
only to preserve the majesty of law by taking appropriate action against 
one howsoever high he may be, if he violates court’s order, but also to 
keep the stream of justice clear and pure (which was highlighted more 
than two and half centuries ago by Lord Hardwicke, L.C. in St. James’s 
Evening Post case) so that the parties who approach the courts to receive 
justice do not have to wade through dirty and polluted water before 
entering their temples ...  
“8. 
To enable the courts to ward off unjustified interference in their 
working, those who indulge in immoral acts like perjury, prevarication and 
motivated falsehoods have to be appropriately dealt with, without which it 
would not be possible for any court to administer justice in the true sense 
and to the satisfaction of those who approach it in the hope that truth 
would ultimately prevail. People would have faith in courts when they 
would find that (truth alone triumphs) is an achievable aim there, or (it is a 
virtue which ends in victory) is not only inscribed in emblem but really 
happens in the portals of courts.” 
5. 
 
In Dhananjay Sharma v. State of Haryana [(1995) 3 SCC 
757], filing a false affidavit was the basis for initiating action in contempt 
jurisdiction and punishing the persons concerned. In B. Srinivasa Reddy v. 
Karnataka Urban Water Supply & Drainage Board Employees Association 
and others [(2006) 11 SCC 731], the Supreme Court held that if a party to a 
lis willfully makes a false or misleading statement to secure a favourable 
order, it interferes with the due course of judicial proceeding and thus 
commits contempt of court. The Indian Supreme Court reaffirmed the above 
principles in K.D. Sharma v. Steel Authority of India Limited and others 
[(2008) 12 SCC 481], Kanwar Singh Saini v. High Court of Delhi [(2012) 
4 SCC 307, and ABCD v. Union of India and others [(2020) 2 SCC 52]. 
6. 
 
Sections 35 and 35A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
(“CPC”), respectively, provide for the imposition of costs and compensatory 
costs in respect of false or vexatious claims or defences.1 Part E, Chapter  
11-E of Volume I of the Lahore High Court Rules and Orders supplement 
these provisions. In Mehr Ashraf and other v. Station House Officer and 
others (PLD 2022 Lahore 328), this Court observed: 
 
“Section 35 deals with actual costs while section 35A with compensatory 
costs. Actual costs reimburse the expenses incurred by the successful 
litigant in asserting his rights/claim, but the court’s discretion in awarding 
them is subject to the conditions and limitations stipulated in Order IX, 
Rule 3, Order XIII, Rules 2 and 4, Order XIX, Rule 3(2), Order XXI, Rule 
72(3), Order XXIII, Rule 1(3), Order XXIV Rule 4, Order XXXII, Rules 
4(4) and 5(2), Order XXXIII, Rules 10, 11 and 16, Order XXXIV, Rule 10 
and Order XXXV Rule 3 CPC. [See: Kawas B. Aga and another v. City 
District Government, Karachi (CDGK) (PLD 2010 Karachi 182)]. 
                                          
1 Parliament has enacted Cost of Litigation Act, 2017, but it is applicable to the Federal Capital Territory 
only. 

Writ Petition No. 9075/2023 
 
- 4 - 
Inasmuch as section 35 aims to reimburse reasonable litigation expenses to 
the successful party, the costs awarded under this section should be 
realistic. In contrast, the compensatory costs envisaged by section 35A 
CPC are compensation for false and vexatious claims and defences and are 
in addition to the actual costs. In awarding them, the court does not 
consider the actual injury to the person or property of a party, which can 
be claimed in a separate suit for damages. However, the aforesaid costs are 
taken into account in that suit.”2 
7. 
 
Recently, in Qazi Naveed ul Islam v. District Judge, Gujrat, 
etc. (PLD 2023 SC 298), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the 
purpose of awarding costs at one level is to compensate the successful party 
for the expenses incurred, and at another level, it is an effective instrument 
for ridding the legal system of frivolous, vexatious and speculative claims 
and defences. It encourages alternative dispute resolution, settlements 
between the parties and reduces the burden of the courts, allowing them to 
focus on genuine claims. “Costs are a weapon of offence for the plaintiff 
with a just claim to present and a shield to the defendant who has been 
unfairly brought into court.” 
8. 
 
The courts dealing with civil suits are bound by the provisions 
of the Code of Civil Procedure and must award costs in accordance with 
them. These provisions circumscribe their discretion. However, while 
exercising constitutional jurisdiction, the High Court may invoke its inherent 
powers to impose special/exemplary costs over and above the amount 
stipulated in section 35A CPC.3 In Inayatullah v. Sh. Muhammad Yousaf 
and others (1997 SCMR 1020), the Supreme Court ruled:  
 
“We are unable to accept the contention of the learned counsel for the 
petitioner that special costs could only be awarded in terms of section 
35A, C.P.C. The learned Judges in the case came to a definite conclusion 
that the proceedings initiated against respondent No. 1 at the instance of 
petitioner were mala fide and that the petitioner had no reasonable ground 
to prosecute the same. In fact, respondent No. 1 was sentenced to one year 
R.I. in the proceedings of the case initiated by the petitioner, which were 
ultimately found to be coram non judice. In these circumstances, the High 
Court was fully competent in the exercise of its inherent power to grant 
appropriate compensation to the respondents. There being no positive 
prohibition on the power of the High Court, while exercising jurisdiction 
under Article 199 of the Constitution, to award costs to compensate a 
party made to suffer unnecessarily through frivolous litigation. The High 
Court, in appropriate cases, in the exercise of its inherent power, may 
award adequate costs by way of compensation to a party made to suffer on 
account of such litigation.”  
                                          
2 In this context, the Judge referred to the Supreme Court’s observations in Muhammad Akram v. Mst. 
Farman Bi (PLD 1990 SC 28).   
3 Mehr Ashraf and other v. Station House Officer and others (PLD 2022 Lahore 328).

Further reference may be made to The Postmaster-General, 
Northern Punjab and AJ&K, Rawalpindi v. Muhammad Bashir and 
others (1998 SCMR 2386); Mst. Asma Begum and others v. The 
Commissioner, Karachi Division, Karachi and others (PLD 1997 Karachi 
13); M.D. Tahir, Advocate v. Federal Government and others (PLD 1999 
Lahore 409); Kawas B. Aga and another v. City District Government, 
Karachi (CDGK) (PLD 2010 Karachi 182); and Azhar Iqbal and others v. 
Government of Pakistan and others (PLD 2015 Islamabad 140). 
9. 
 
There is a misconception that the courts cannot impose costs in 
criminal matters. In Deen Muhammad and Others v. Assistant 
Commissioner and S. D. M., Shahdadpur and others (1984 SCMR 455), 
the petitioners filed two applications in the Sindh High Court. One was 
under section 561-A Cr.P.C. regarding a proceeding which, according to the 
petitioners, was pending before the Assistant Commissioner, Shahdadpur, 
under section 145 Cr.P.C. Based on that assertion, they also got an 
injunction from the High Court which stayed the proceeding. Subsequently, 
it turned out that no such proceeding under section 145 Cr.P.C. was pending 
before the Assistant Commissioner. The High Court dismissed the 
petitioners’ application under section 561-A Cr.P.C. with costs of  
Rs.2,000/-. The second application sought action against the Assistant 
Commissioner under the erstwhile Contempt of Court Act, 1976. The 
learned Judge determined that it also lacked merit for the above-mentioned 
reason and dismissed it with the costs of Rs.500/- payable to the 
Mukhtiarkar and the Supervising Tapedar each. The Supreme Court refused 
to grant leave against the High Court’s order imposing costs. It stated: 
“The contention is that there is no provision of law in the Criminal 
Procedure Code under which costs can be awarded. The award of costs is 
not alien to the criminal jurisprudence. There are situations where costs 
are awarded, such as under section 148(3) Cr.P.C. The High Court can 
also impose costs under section 491(2) Cr.P.C. as provided under rule 17 
(previously rule 10) of the High Court Rules and Orders, Chapter 4-F, 
Volume V, which reads: 
‘In disposing of any such rule the Court may in its discretion make 
an order for the payment by one side or the other of the costs of the 
rule.’  
“Section 547 Cr.P.C. deals with the recovery of moneys other than fine.” 
  
 
The Supreme Court also observed that the petitioners’ first 
application before the High Court was under section 561-A Cr.P.C. The said 

Writ Petition No. 9075/2023 
 
- 6 - 
provision empowers the court “to make such orders as may be necessary to 
prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of 
justice.” Since the High Court had determined that the petitioners’ 
applications were based on misrepresentation, they secured a stay order, and 
the concerned officials had been summoned, it was justified in concluding 
that they were guilty of abuse of the process of the court. It follows that in 
appropriate cases, the High Court may also invoke section 561-A Cr.P.C. to 
impose costs.  
10. 
 
Recently, in Qazi Naveed-ul-Islam v. District Judge, Gujrat, 
etc. (PLD 2023 SC 298), the Supreme Court imposed costs of Rs.100,000/- 
under Order 28 Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules 1980 while refusing 
leave to appeal to the petitioner whose application under section 476 Cr.P.C. 
was dismissed by all the courts below.  
11. 
 
Section 491(2) Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to frame rules 
to regulate the procedure in habeas corpus petitions. Volume V, Chapter 4, 
Part F of the Lahore High Court Rules & Orders contains the rules framed in 
the exercise of that power. Rule 16 stipulates that to check the tendency to 
file vexatious habeas corpus petitions, the court may, at its discretion, 
require the party concerned to deposit in advance an amount as fixed by the 
court directing the issuance of rule nisi to be paid to the detenus as 
compensation if the petition is found to be frivolous or vexatious. Rule 17 
provides that in disposing of such rule nisi the court may, at its discretion, 
make an order for the payment by one side or the other of the costs of the 
rule. The courts use these provisions quite frequently. 
12. 
 
The present case is a classic example of abuse of the process of 
the court. Accordingly, this petition is dismissed with costs of Rs.10,000/-. 
The Petitioner has incurred criminal liability and has also rendered herself 
liable for contempt of court for which separate proceedings shall be initiated.
