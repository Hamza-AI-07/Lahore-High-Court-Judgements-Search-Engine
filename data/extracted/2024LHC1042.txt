acquisition process, initiated pursuant to the decision of 
Federal Government for the development of 600 -
Megawatt Peak Capacity Soler PV Project, in District 
Kot Addu / Muzaffargarh, Punjab – detailed description 
of the land is found in documents attached and in 
particular the Notification(s)-cum-Corrigendum(s). Land 
was to be acquired for NTDC; the Company tasked with 
the assignment of implementation of the project. Energy 
security, environmental protection, affordability of 
electricity and sustainable development were the 
hallmark features of the project, which objectives 
indicate 
the 
public 
good 
and 
utility 
intended.

Notifications under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act 
1894 (“the Act, 1894”) were issued on 06.01.2023 
(published in Gazette on 11.01.2023) and 23.01.2023 
(published on 13.02.2023), whereafter corrigendum(s) 
were accordingly issued on 24.02.2023 and published. 
Officers were authorized to enter upon and survey the 
land. Estimated cost, 
assessed 
to the tune of 
Rs.929,985,245/- 
by 
District 
Price 
Assessment 
Committee was approved in meeting conducted on 
28.02.2023, which was deposited by the Company on 
18.05.2023. Notification under section 17(4) read with 
section 6 of Act, 1894 was issued on 12.07.2023. Board 
of Revenue in its meeting on 15.09.2023, chaired by 
Senior Member, approved the rates and cost. Notices 
under section 9 of Act, 1894 were issued on 01.01.2024, 
followed by notices under section 10 of the Act, 1894. 
This is when the challenge was thrown to the acquisition 
proceedings, in particular to Notification under sections 4 
and 17(4) & 6 of Act, 1894 by invoking constitutional 
jurisdiction.   
2. 
Notices were issued on the premise that 
Notification under section 17(4) & 6 of the Act, 1894 
was issued by Commissioner Rawalpindi and not by the 
Commissioner concerned, and an additional point  argued 
was alleged violation of section 230 of the Elections Act, 
2017 (“the Act, 2017”). Report and para-wise comments 
were filed on 27.02.2024.

3. 
Submissions made are largely directed against 
procedural defects, misuse of authority and lack of 
application of mind by the persons tasked with the duties 
under the law. It is alleged that Notification, under 
section 17(4) & 6 of the Act, 1894, was issued by the 
Commissioner Rawalpindi, who was not competent to 
determine urgency involved for taking possession. It is 
alleged that in derogation of the procedure provided no 
opportunities were extended for filing objections under 
section 5-A of the Act, 1894. It is argued that no 
application of mind is demonstrated from the text of the 
Notification under section 17(4) of the Act, 1894. 
Pleaded that notices under section 9 of the Act, 1894 
were not issued prior to the Notification under section 
17(4) of the Act, 1894. It is further pleaded that 
agricultural land is being acquired to the detriment of the 
owners / occupiers. It is submitted that Punjab Caretaker 
Government lacked authority to implement and enforce 
the codal and procedural requirements under the law. 
Places reliance on decision reported as “Kareem Nawaz 
and 4 others Vs. District Collector / Deputy 
Commissioner Multan and 14 others” (PLD 2023 
Lahore 1). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel appearing for the 
Company - NTDC - submits that possession of the land, 
pursuant to Notification under section 17(4) of the Act, 
1894, was not acquired till date despite issuance of 

                                      W.P. No. 1355 of 2024 
4 
 
notices under sections 9 & 10 of the Act, 1894 – it is not 
disputed that notices were issued in January 2024. 
Submits that purpose of issuing notices under section 9 of 
the Act, 1894 was conveyance of information to the 
public about the intent to take possession. Adds that 
process required under section 10 of the Act, 1894 had 
commenced. Submits that Notification, under section 
17(4) read with section 6 of the Act, 1894, was issued by 
the Commissioner D.G Khan, signed by him and other 
officers, which was issued after fulfilling requisite 
conditionalities. 
Adds 
that 
mentioning 
of 
the 
Commissioner Rawalpindi, in paragraph 3 of said 
Notification was typographical mistake, which is 
evidently inferable from perusal of complete text of 
Notification under reference. Adds that corrigendum will 
be issued accordingly to rectify mistake.  Learned 
counsel for the respondents relied upon decisions, 
reported as “Muhammad Ashiq and another Vs. Water and 
Manpower Development Authority, Lahore through Chairman, 
WAPDA House and another” (PLD 2008 Supreme Court 335), 
“Muhammad Afzal Bhatti and 17 others Vs. Province of Punjab 
through Collector, Rawalpindi and 4 others” (1997 SCMR 296), 
“Jan Meah Vs. Deputy Secretary to Government of East Pakistan, 
Revenue (Requisition) Department, DACCA and others” (PLD 
1965 Dacca 36), “Muhammad Shafi and 8 others Vs. Multan 
Development Authority, Multan through Director General, Multan 
and 7 others” (2010 YLR 1161), “Makhdoom Ahmad Ghauns Vs.

Before dilating upon the issues agitated, it is 
appropriate to reproduce statement in writing submitted 
by Land Acquisition Collector, who is present in person. 
Statement is taken on record as “Mark-A”, text whereof 
is reproduced, for ease of reference, 
 
 
Statement 
 
I, Muhammad Waseem Shiekh, son of Muhammad Rafiq, 
having CNIC No: 33202-1606360-3, Land Acquisition Collector EHV-
I, NTDC, Lahore, do hereby make a statement before Honorable 
Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, Multan, in W.P. No: 1355/24, 
1358/24, 2337/24, that I will make sure that a Corrigendum be issued 
to Notification under section 17(4) & 6 Published in official gazette on 
19-07-2023, to rectify the typographical mistake in 3rd paragraph of 
aforesaid Notification where in "Commissioner Rawalpindi" has been 
mentioned mistakenly instead of "Commissioner Dera Ghazi Khan". 
 
Through the Corrigendum "Commissioner Rawalpindi" will 
be edited and it will be read as "Commissioner Dera Ghazi khan".

There is no cavil that project in question qualifies 
test of acquisition of land for Public Purpose. Project in 
question is for the greater good of the citizens / public, 
which are facing super-cycle of inflation and enduring 
high cost of living – spiraling cost of electricity largely 
contributes to the miseries of common man. No occasion 
arises to question the legitimacy of the Notification under 
section 4 of the Act, 1894, wherefrom it is clear that 
Federal Government proposed project of electrification 
by tapping Solar energy, which identified NTDC for this 
purpose and tasked it to proceed to take land for the 
purpose of installation of solar panels – land is acquired 

                                      W.P. No. 1355 of 2024

for NTDC, “the Company”. Objection worth considering 
is the effect of issuance of notices under section 9 of the 
Act, 1894 after the expression of urgency was conveyed 
and materialized in shape of the Notification under 
section 17(4) of the Act, 1894. It is appropriate to 
reproduce section 17 of the Act, 1894, which reads as, 
17. Special power in cases of urgency.– (1) In cases of 
urgency, whenever the Commissioner so directs, the 
Collector, though no such award has been made, may, on the 
expiration of fifteen days from publication of the notice 
mentioned in sub-section (1) of section 9, take possession of 
any land needed for public purposes or for a Company. Such 
land shall thereupon vest absolutely in the Government, free 
from all encumbrances: 
Provided that the Commissioner shall not issue any 
direction to the Collector under this sub-section 
unless the Department of Government, the local 
authority, or Company, as the case may be, for 
which the land is being acquired, has first deposited 
the estimated cost of acquisition of such land as 
determined by the Collector of the district, keeping 
in view the provisions of sections 23 and 24. 
 
(2)  Whenever, owing to any sudden change in the channel of 
any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency, it 
becomes necessary for any Railway Administration to acquire 
the immediate possession of any land for the maintenance of 
their traffic or for the purpose of making thereon a river-side 
or ghat station, or of providing convenient connection with or 
access to any such station, or whenever owing to a similar 
emergency it becomes necessary for the Commissioner to 
acquire the immediate possession of any land for the purposes 
of maintaining traffic over a public road, the Collector may, 
immediately after the publication of the notice mentioned in 
sub-section (1) and with the previous sanction of 
the Commissioner, enter upon and take possession of such 
land, which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the 
Government free from all encumbrances: 
Provided that the Collector shall not take possession 
of any building or part of a building under this sub-
section without giving to the occupier thereof at least 
forty-eight hours’ notice of his intention so to do, or 
such longer notice as may be reasonably sufficient to 
enable such occupier to remove his movable property 
from 
such 
building 
without 
unnecessary 
inconvenience. 
 
(3)  In every case under either of the preceding sub-sections 
the Collector shall at the time of taking possession offer to 
the persons interested compensation for the standing crops 
and trees (if any) on such land and for any other damage 
sustained by them caused by such sudden dispossession and 
not excepted in section 24; and, in case such offer is not 
accepted, the value of such crops and trees and the amount 

                                      W.P. No. 1355 of 2024 
7 
 
of such other damage shall be allowed for in awarding 
compensation for the land under the provisions herein 
contained. 
 
(4)  In cases where in the opinion of the Commissioner, the 
provisions of sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) are 
applicable, 
the Commissioner 
may 
direct 
that 
the 
provisions of sections 5 and 5-A shall not apply, and, if he 
does so direct, a declaration may be made under section 6 
in respect of the land at any time after the publication of the 
notification under sub-section (1) of section 4.

8. 
Upon perusal of sub-section (1) of section 17 of 
the Act, 1894 it transpires that the Commissioner was 
assigned the lead role and upon Commissioner’s 
directions, the collector was competent to take possession 
of the land after passing of fifteen days, from the 
publication of the notice under section 9(1) of the Act, 
1894. Notwithstanding the fact that notice under section 
9 of Act, 1894 was issued after Notification under section 
17(4) of the Act, 1894, no infringement of the statutory 
command was evidently committed. Possession could be 
taken after fifteen days of the notice under section 9(1) of 
the Act, 1894, objective whereof was to inform the intent 
to take possession of land, indicated in the Notification 
under section 4 of the Act, 1894. Evidently, Notification, 
under section 17(4) of the Act, 1894, was issued on 
12.07.2023, possession is still with the landowners / 
occupiers, who, by now, have had sufficient notice of the 
intent and cognizance of the urgency expressed for taking 
possession. Condition imposed in terms of proviso to 
sub-section (1) of section 17 of the Act, 1894 was also 
met. Estimated price and rates were approved by the 

                                      W.P. No. 1355 of 2024

District Price Committee and Board of Revenue. 
Company had deposited the estimated cost of acquisition 
of land determined accordingly before the issuance of 
Notification, under section 17(4) of the Act, 1894. It is 
evident from the record that acquisition process is 
progressing at reasonable pace, which manifest real 
intent of the law. Land Acquisition collector stated that 
corrigendum would be issued to the Notification section 
17(4) of the Act, 1894. Notices under sections 9(1) and 
10 of the Act, 1894 were issued in January 2024 – 
obviously fifteen days had passed since then, hence, 
restriction on taking possession, under section 17(1) of 
the Act, 1894, was done away with. Requirement of the 
proviso to section 6 of the Act, 1894 was also met, as the 
estimated cost of acquisition of the land was deposited 
before issuance of composite Notification under section 
17(4), read with section 6, of the Act, 1894, by the 
Commissioner Dera Ghazi Khan, who acted in 
accordance with the statutory discretion extended – 
Notification in question starts with the sentence that 
„Whereas it appears to the Commissioner Dera Ghazi 
Khan ………‟. The Notification was signed by the 
Commissioner, with other signatories, which, inter alia, 
included the District Collector, Land Acquisition 
Collector and the Engineer. This lends credence to the 
argument regarding typographical mistake in mentioning 
Commissioner Rawalpindi, once, in the Notification. It is 

                                      W.P. No. 1355 of 2024 
9 
 
not for this court to review or assess that what was the 
urgency to take possession, which assessment has to be 
made by the Commissioner. In fact, the opinion 
expressed by the Commissioner and assessment of 
element urgency for the purposes of taking possession of 
the land call for showing deference. Nothing is alleged 
that how composite Notification under section 17(4) and 
section 6 of the Act, 1894 had prejudiced the petitioners. 
And upon issuance of Notification under reference, 
section 5 and 5-A of the Act, 1894 had no application. 
There is no occasion, in the circumstances of the case, to 
undermine the concept of Eminent domain and 
jurisprudence developed vis-à-vis “the Taking clause”, 
which acknowledges the right to fair and just 
compensation against the acquisition of land for public 
purpose. Nothing is pleaded with regard to alleged denial 
of compensation, and right to disagree to the quantum of 
compensation determined or to seek enhancement thereof 
is neither prejudiced nor denied. Hence, no cause is 
apparently 
available 
to 
invoke 
judicial 
review 
jurisdiction.     
9. 
Much emphasis is laid on the ratio of the decision 
in the case of KAREEM NAWAZ (supra), which is 
examined and found that said judgment was issued in the 
context of peculiar facts, which is not the case here. 
Some distinguishing features between the facts of these 
petitions and facts indicated in the judgment relied, need 

                                      W.P. No. 1355 of 2024

recapitulation. In referred case Notification under section 
4 of the Act, 1894 was issued on 22.07.2020 and 
Notification under sections 17(4) & 6 of the Act, 1894 
was issued on 28.02.2022 – after two years, and in that 
context cause of urgency was interpreted. Conversely, in 
instant case Notification under section 4 of the Act was 
issued in January 2023 and Notification, allowing taking 
of possession was issued in July 2023. In referred case 
legality of Notification under section 4 of the Act, 1894 
was questioned on the premise that Notification was 
signed by Group Captain, Director Revenue Record, Air 
Headquarters, Islamabad – this was termed as abdication 
of duty by District Collector. Another distinguishing 
feature was that second Notification under section 17(4) 
of the Act, 1894 was allegedly issued under dictated 
exercise of powers –signatories of the Notification were 
Base Commander PAF base & Military Estate Officer, 
Multan Circle. In said judgement, it was observed that 
possession can only be taken after publication of the 
notices under section 9 of the Act, 1894. And in the case 
at hand, notices were issued in January 2024 and taking 
of possession has still not commenced. Judgment referred 
had discussed scope of section 17(4) of the Act, 1894 in 
the context of circumstances involved therein; but the 
provision of law was not declared ultra vires. Once land 
is required for public purpose, interference by exercising 
judicial review jurisdiction tantamount to throw spanner 

                                      W.P. No. 1355 of 2024

in the works. Petitioners had the opportunity to file 
objections after the Notices under sections 9 and 10 of 
the Act, 1894 issued but their ambition was to knock-
down the purpose of acquisition, which purpose has to 
fail. No significant procedural defect, misuse or 
abdication of authority and illegality in exercise of 
powers is established – no question of violation of 
section 230 of the Act 2017 arises when Notification 
under section 4 and Notification under section 17(4) of 
the Act, 1894 were issued before assumption of control 
by Caretaker Government at Federal level. Land is 
acquired for the Company, which is tasked to undertake a 
project having benefits and advantages for the public. 
10. 
Instant petition along with connected petitions are 
hereby dismissed. This order will not prejudice exercise 
of rights, available to the petitioners under the provisions 
of Act, 1894.
