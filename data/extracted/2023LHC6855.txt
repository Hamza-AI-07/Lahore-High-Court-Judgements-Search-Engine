The petitioners instituted a suit for declaration, 
specific performance and injunction against respondents 
No.3 and 4 (hereinafter referred to as “respondents”) 
before the learned Civil Judge Class-I, Rawalpindi. On 
account of their absence, the “respondents” were 
proceeded against ex-parte vide order dated 7th February, 
2020 and ultimately suit was decreed as such vide 
judgment dated 5th July, 2021. An application under 
section 12 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) 
(hereinafter referred to as “CPC”) was moved by the 
“respondents” seeking annulment of the decree, which 
was though resisted by the petitioners but it was accepted 
vide order dated 7th July, 2023. Feeling aggrieved, the  
petitioners filed revision petition before the learned 
Additional District Judge but of no avail as the same was 
dismissed through order dated 14th October, 2023, hence 
this petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
2.  
Learned counsel for the petitioners contended 
that the “respondents” since did not appear despite  
publication, so trial Court had rightly proceeded against 
them ex-parte. She added that ex-parte decree was though 
passed after observing all the codal formalities but it is 

2 
 
 
W.P.No.4158 of 2023 
 
annulled on the application of “respondents” without 
assigning any lawful reasoning. Learned counsel 
maintained that even the revisional Court did not take into 
consideration the material irregularity committed by the 
trial Court and affirmed the order in a mechanical 
manner. 
3.  
Heard. Record perused. 
4.  
Suit was instituted by the petitioners mentioning 
that the “respondents” are residents of Nai Abadi Thokal, 
Mirpur, Azad Kashmir. It appears that initially for 
procuring the attendance of the “respondents”, trial Court 
directed the issuance of process but summons could not be 
issued due to non-deposit of process fee by the petitioners. 
Instead of proceeding against the petitioners on account of 
their failure to deposit the process fee, the trial Court 
opted to issue proclamation in the newspaper.  
5.  
Order V “CPC” relates to issuance and service 
of summons. Ex-parte proceedings were ordered against 
the “respondent” while resorting to the mode of 
substituted service through publication in newspaper. 
Order V Rule 20 “CPC” prescribes the mode of 
substituted service, which is reproduced below for ready 
reference and convenience :- 
 “20. Substituted service.-- (l) Where the Court is satisfied that 
there is reason to believe that the defendant is keeping out of 
the way for the purpose of avoiding service, or that for any 
other reason the summons cannot be served in the ordinary 
way, the Court shall order for service of the summons by-  
(a) affixing a copy of the summons at some conspicuous part 
of the house, if any, in which the defendant is known to have 
last resided or carried on business or personally worked for 
gain; or (b) any electronic device of communication which 
may include telegram, telephone, phonogram, telex, fax, radio 
and television; or (c) urgent mail service or public courier 
services; or (d) beat of drum in the locality where the 
defendant resides; or (e) publication in press; or (f) any other 
manner or mode as it may think fit;  
Provided that the Court may order the use of all or any of the 
aforesaid manners and modes of service simultaneously.  

3 
 
 
W.P.No.4158 of 2023 
 
Effect of substituted service.-- (2) Service substituted by order 
of the Court shall be as effectual as if it had been made on the 
defendant personally.  
Where service substituted time for appearance to be fixed.-- 
(3) Where service is substituted by order of the Court, the 
Court shall fix such time for the appearance of the defendant 
as the case may require which shall not ordinarily exceed 
fifteen days.”  
Though Rule 20 provides the mechanism of substituted 
service but before resorting to said provision of law it is 
incumbent upon the Court to first ensure the adherence to 
Rules 16, 18 & 19 of Order ibid. 
6.  
In terms of Rule 16 it is obligatory for a serving 
officer who delivers or tenders a copy of the summons to 
the defendant personally, or to an agent or other person 
on his behalf, that he shall require the signature of the 
person to whom the copy is so delivered or tendered to an 
acknowledgment of service endorsed on the original 
summons. Rule 18 further directs the manner of service in 
which the same is served, to mention the name and 
address of the person (if any) and identify the person 
served and witnesses of the delivery or tender of the 
summons. Rule 19 further goes on to lay down the 
procedure for the Court that where a summon is returned 
under Rule 17 aforesaid duly verified, the serving officer 
shall be examined on oath and may make such inquiry in 
the matter as it thinks fit and shall either declare that the 
summons is duly served or as it thinks fit and after his full 
satisfaction to proceed further. The provisions mentioned 
hereinabove are not illusory but it is bounden duty of the 
Court to make substantial compliance of the same before 
directing the substituted service in terms of Order V Rule 
20 of “CPC”. The Court for the said purpose has to 
satisfy itself that all the efforts to effect service in the 
ordinary mode have failed. Non-adherence to the 
mandatory provisions would render the process invalid 
and the edifice built thereon would automatically fall

down. Reliance in this respect can be placed on Mrs. 
NARGIS LATIF vs Mrs. FEROZ AFAQ AHMED KHAN 
(2001 SCMR 99) and Haji AKBAR and others vs GUL 
BARAN and 7 others (1996 SCMR 1703). 
7.  
In the case of WAPDA vs GHULAM HUSSAIN 
(2000 CLC 530) this Court, while outlining the scope and 
object of Order V Rule 20 of “CPC” held as under :- 
 “12. The object behind substitutive service is that the 
defendant may either himself learn about the proceedings 
pending against him in the court, or he may be informed by 
some other person, who has read such notice in the 
newspaper, in case the defendant has not read the same. 
Another object behind service through publication is that the 
proceedings in the suit may continue and the same may not be 
defeated, merely because the defendant cannot be served with 
summons in. the ordinary manner. 
13. The petitioner had made no attempt to avoid acceptance of 
service in ordinary way. The Trial Court by ordering 
substitutive service without justifying the legal position had 
proceeded against the petitioner ex parte. 
14. Notice of a proceedings is a basic right of party and notice 
by substituted service cannot be ordered unless Court comes 
to the conclusion that party was avoiding service of notice or 
personal service was not reasonably practicable upon all 
defendants. Mere issue of notice several times upon the 
defendants/party without any report of bailiff, that it was not 
reasonably practicable for him to serve such notice, would not 
lay foundation for publication of notice. In this context a 
reference can be made to a case of M. Saadullah and 28 others 
v. Tahir Ali and 2 others 1986 CLC 2643, Major Taj-ud-Din 
and others v. Muhammad Akhtar and others 1989 CLC 2183, 
Shakoor Hussain v. Muhammad Sadiq 1991 MLD 67, Javed 
Raza v. Razi Ahmad 1991 MLD 2602, Major (Retd.) 
Muhammad Yusuf  Baig v. Mst. Saeeda Parveen 1984 CLC 
668.” 
Reliance in this respect can also be placed on Syed 
SAJJAD HUSSAIN SHAH vs Messrs FEDERATION OF 
EMPLOYEES COOPERATIVE HOUSING SOCIETIES 
LTD. through General Secretary (2003 CLC 1011). 
8.  
The “respondents” were admittedly residing 
abroad. Rule 25 of Order V of “CPC” deals with service 
where defendant resides out of Pakistan, which reads as 
under: - 

5 
 
 
W.P.No.4158 of 2023 
 
“25. 
Where the defendant resides out of Pakistan and has 
no agent in Pakistan empowered to accept service, the 
summons shall except in the cases mentioned in rule 26A be 
addressed to the defendant at the place where he is residing 
and sent to him by post, if there is postal communication 
between such place and the place where the court is situate.” 
9.  
A glimpse of record made it abundantly clear 
that proper procedure was not observed in the course of 
effecting service of the “respondents”. No active or 
concrete effort was made for the personal service. The 
resort to the substituted service in the circumstances was 
not only highly unwarranted but sketchy. The process of 
service was thus on the one hand tainted with procedural 
material irregularities and on the other fraught with 
illegalities. 
10. 
To this effect the case of MEHR DIN through 
Legal Heirs vs AZIZAN and another (1994 SCMR 1110) 
is quite relevant wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
held as under :- 
“The perusal of the application filed by the respondents before 
the trial Court for setting aside the ex parte decree dated 
29-7-1967 would show that the same was filed under Order 9 
Rule 13 (wrongly written as rule 2) read with section 12(2) 
C.P.C. on the grounds that the decree was obtained by fraud, 
misrepresentation and false statement of which they got the 
knowledge when the suit for the recovery of produce of the 
disputed land was filed against Karim Bakhsh who was in 
cultivating possession thereof as a tenant of the respondent. 
The sum and substance of the petition is that the decree holder 
practised fraud in the service of summons and kept the 
pendency of the suit against the respondents concealed from 
them by fraud and misrepresentation. The copies of the 
summons placed on the file reveal that proper procedure was 
not observed in effecting service upon the respondents who 
were admittedly Pardanashin ladies and special care had to be 
taken to inform them of the filing of the suit. The report on the 
first summons show that the respondents informed the 
process-server that in the absence of their attorney they cannot 
sign or thumb-impress the summons while at the time of visit 
of the process server for the second time for effecting service, 
the respondents were not present in their house. No effort was 
made to personally serve the respondents in the presence of 
their close relatives. The learned High Court has exhaustively 
incorporated the relevant provisions of C.P.C. pertaining to 
service on the parties which have not been complied with and 
the High Court justifiably felt inclined to annul the ex parte 
decree against the ladies/respondents and ordering de novo 
trial.”

11. 
It is thus apparent that on the basis of invalid 
substituted mode of service the “respondents” were 
proceeded against ex-parte vide order dated 7th February, 
2020. It is also evident from the record that the 
“respondents” are residing in England since long. The 
parties are though closely related but the petitioners did  
not mention the addresses of “respondents” abroad. The 
“respondents” were, thus, proceeded against ex-parte in 
an illegal and unlawful manner, which followed the ex-
parte 
decree. 
On 
attaining 
the 
knowledge, 
the 
“respondents” moved a petition under section 12 (2) 
“CPC” seeking annulment of the ex-parte decree on the 
ground that it is obtained through misrepresentation. The 
above are the sufficient grounds to show that ex-parte 
proceedings order followed by the ex-parte decree was not 
the outcome of due course of law. This was the reason that 
the learned Civil Judge, in the first instance, allowed the 
petition and set aside the ex-parte proceedings order as 
well as decree, which was further affirmed by the 
revisional Court and rightly so. 
12. 
The petitioners are seeking writ of certiorari in 
terms of Article 199 (1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, which has a very 
limited scope. The petitioners, in order to persuade the 
Court to exercise the extraordinary jurisdiction, have to 
demonstrate that the order or judgment under assailance 
is without lawful authority and suffers with material 
illegalities. The petitioners have failed to point out any 
perversity or material irregularity, warranting exercise of 
constitutional jurisdiction by this Court. Reliance in this 
regard can be placed on AMJAD KHAN v. MUHAMMAD 
IRSHAD (DECEASED) through LRs (2020 SCMR 2155) 
and CHIEF EXECUTIVE MEPCO and others v. 
MUHAMMAD FAZIL and others (2019 SCMR 919).

For the foregoing reasons, instant petition being 
bereft of any merits is dismissed in limine.
