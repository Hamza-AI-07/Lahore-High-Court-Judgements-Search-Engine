Advocates for the respondent.    
 
 
 
 
Following questions, statedly arising out of order 
of 20.04.2022 by the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, 
Multan Bench, Multan (the “Tribunal”), are proposed for 
determination. 
1. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the 
learned ATIR has failed to appreciate that the profit on 
redeemable capital on the basis of profit/loss sharing 
basis is not an admissible expense under any provision 
of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001? 
 
2.  Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the 
learned ATIR has failed to appreciate that the profit on 
redeemable capital is not in the nature of interest on 
borrowed money therefore, no deductible u/s 21 of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001? 
 
3.   Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the 
learned ATIR has failed to appreciate that Participation 
Term Finance Certificates were issued for redeemable 
capital u/s 120 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984 
which are not interest based. 
 
2. 
Tax Year was 2010. Record depicts that the 
Tribunal had dismissed the appeal of the department on 
the ground that no recharacterization of the transaction, 
presented by the taxpayer while furnishing return or 
through lateral explanation, could be directed in 

ITR No.53/2022 
 
2 
 
absence of any notice or prior intimation, indicating an 
intent to recharacterize the transaction in question – 
presently, respondent taxpayer had sought allowable 
deduction on the premise of payment of profits, subject 
to tax deductions under section 151 of the Income Tax 
Ordinance 2001 (‘Ordinance’), to the holders of 
Participatory 
Term 
Finance 
Certificates 
(PTFCs), 
happened to be the shareholders / directors of 
respondent company (‘certificate holders’). In this case 
notice under section 122(5A) / (9) of the Ordinance, 
intending an amendment of assessment for relevant tax 
year, was conveyed. Tribunal had not determined the 
admissibility or otherwise of the deduction claimed but 
dismissed department’s appeal in wake of absence of 
due process requirement. It is pertinent to identify that 
certificate holders had extended redeemable capital to 
the company – distinguishable from transaction of 
equity injection against acquisition of shares. 
3. 
In the context of operative and material 
observations 
recorded 
by 
the 
Tribunal, 
actual 
controversy hinges on the interpretation of scope and 
effect of section 109 of the Ordinance. And incidentally, 
questions 
proposed 
do 
not 
reflect 
the 
actual 
controversy, we, therefore, recast the question of law: 

ITR No.53/2022 
 
3 
 
Whether section 109 of the Ordinance could be 
given effect while undertaking an exercise of 
amendment of assessment proceedings? 
4. 
Learned counsel for the respondent submits that 
recharacterization of transaction was not a legally 
permissible course, while amending the assessment; 
adds that if at all such recharacterization was warranted, 
such course could be adopted by issuance of fresh and 
separate notice, accordingly. Submits that precise 
allegation in show cause notice was that profits paid to 
certificate holders were not subjected to payment of tax 
under section 151 of the Ordinance, which query was 
addressed, whereafter, there was no basis for 
recharacterization. 
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the applicant 
department 
submits 
that 
declaration 
of 
recharacterization does not require issuance of separate 
notice but such course was the consequence of analysis 
undertaken pursuant to notice under section 122(5A) of 
the Ordinance. 
6. 
Heard.  
7. 
Evidently, respondent claimed deduction of the 
sums paid as profits to certificate holders, as an 
allowable expense incurred and accordingly deductible. 
Transaction came under scrutiny and analysis thereof 
convinced the Assessing officer that substance of the 

ITR No.53/2022 
 
4 
 
transaction was not aligned with the form thereof – the 
way it was presented by the taxpayer.  Undisputedly,  
when asked about the nature of the transaction, 
substance and economic rational thereof, [taxpayer] was 
obligated to justify, explain and substantiate that 
deduction claimed was in accordance with the law and 
otherwise not intended as a tool to avoid tax – 
otherwise bordering tax evasion. And if taxpayer fails, 
the Assessing officer is within the scope of jurisdictional 
mandate to unshackle the transaction and identify its 
true character – Assessing officer is not bound to accept 
the transaction as devised by the taxpayer but entitled 
to unfold the layering and understand substance 
thereof. This course is permissible and is, legally, 
classified as, recharacterization of the transaction – 
envisaged in terms of section 109 of the Ordinance. 
Section 109 of the Ordinance starts with the caveat “…… 
for the purposes of determining liability of tax under the 
ordinance….”, 
which 
indicates 
that 
resort 
to 
recharacterization mechanism could be made in the 
circumstances and such pathway is a permissible mode 
for determining the tax liability. It is fallacious to believe 
that recharacterization process is independent of 
scrutiny undertaken in terms of section 122 of the 
Ordinance – no similarity could be claimed qua 

ITR No.53/2022 
 
5 
 
recharacterization mechanism and an instance where 
explanation was sought in the context of section 111 of 
the Ordinance, when in later case taxpayer is confronted 
with the identity / acquisition of a tangible asset or 
possession of money, and asked to provide source 
thereof and in former case transaction was transacted 
and claimed as valid one.  And what was  required to be 
determined is true character or substance thereof. 
Piercing of transaction to unfold its true character is in 
essence 
recharacterization 
thereof 
– 
which 
is 
elaboration of concept of “look at versus look through”. 
Recharacterization is the consequence of exercise of 
jurisdiction under section 122 of the Ordinance and 
objective thereof is to reverse an unintended tax 
advantage, not otherwise available. Tribunal non-suited 
the department and annulled determinations on the 
ground that no prior notice was issued before 
embarking upon an exercise of recharacterization of 
transaction. This understanding  of concept of 
recharacterization under section 109 of the Ordinance is 
grossly flawed. Power / authority to recharacterize 
transaction is part and parcel of the jurisdiction 
exercisable while undertaking re-assessment of deemed 
assessment order - it is evident from the contents of 
show-cause notice that explanation was sought qua 

ITR No.53/2022 
 
6 
 
legality of an expense / deduction claimed with respect 
to the profits paid to the certificate holders and 
explanation provided was found inadequate and 
commercially deviant, whereupon the Assessing officer 
denied claim of an allowable expense after unearthing 
the true character / substance of the transaction – in 
brief, recharacterization is an incidence / process of 
evaluating and defining the real nature of the 
transaction. Therefore, power to ascertain substance of 
the transaction, contrary to its form, while undertaking 
re-assessment of assessment order, is not a mutually 
exclusive exercise but mutually inclusive process. And is 
part and parcel of jurisdiction to amend the assessment. 
No violation of due process principle was apparent when 
respondent taxpayer was put to notice with respect to 
the transaction claimed as allowable deduction, and 
same would always be entitled to explain the 
transaction and establish objectivity thereof, to dislodge 
impression of avoidance of tax. We refrain from 
commenting on the merits of the transaction and 
admissibility thereof in the context of deduction 
claimed.  
8. 
 In view of the above, we hold that process of 
recharacterization of transaction is part of the 
jurisdiction exercised under section 122 of the 

ITR No.53/2022 
 
7 
 
Ordinance and no fresh notice was required before 
uncovering the substance of the transaction. Since 
Tribunal had dismissed the appeal on the ground of 
absence of due process requirement – absence of notice 
before carrying out recharacterization of transaction - 
therefore, we are inclined to remand the matter to the 
Tribunal for deciding the appeal of the department on 
merits, afresh.  
9. 
Reframed question of law is answered in 
affirmative and decided in favour of the applicant 
department and reference application is allowed 
accordingly. Questions originally framed need not to be 
discussed.  
10. 
Office shall send copy of this order under the seal 
of the Court to the learned Appellate Tribunal as per the 
requirements of Section 133(8) of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001.
