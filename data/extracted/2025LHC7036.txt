“2. 
Brief facts of the case as disclosed in application Ex.PF moved by 
complainant Nazeer Ahmad (PW-4) are that on 05.07.2021 at about 08:00 AM, 
complainant Nazeer Ahmad (PW-4) along with his sister Razia Asghar (PW-5), 
niece Najma Asghar (deceased) and nephew Moulla Bakhash (given up PW), 
while boarding on Rickshaw to take medicine of Razia Asghar went to Aziz 
Fatima Hospital. They while de-boarding the said Rickshaw, entered in the main 
gate of Aziz Fatima Hospital, suddenly accused Muhammad Hussain while armed 
with pistol came there, within their view, accused Muhammad Hussain made 
three successive fire shots with his pistol which hit two fires on the front side of 
the chest and one fire hit on the right thigh of Najma Asghar (deceased), due to 
said injuries Mst. Najma Asghar succumbed to the injuries at the spot. 
Motive behind the occurrence was that accused Muhammad Hussain 
intends to marry with Najma Asghar deceased, who refused to marry with 
accused Muhammad Hussain. In consequence of said refusal, accused 
Muhammad Hussain mercilessly murdered Mst. Najma Asghar. They tried to 
apprehend the accused, who decamped from the venue of occurrence while 
brandishing his pistol. Thereafter, complainant Nazeer Ahmad produced 
complaint Exh.PF before Zafar Iqbal Khatia SI/I.O. at Aziz Fatima Hospital, 
Faisalabad which bears his thumb mark. Ex.PF/1 and signature Ex.PF/2, on the 
basis of which FIR was registered. Hence this FIR.”  
3. 
The investigation of the case was initiated by Zafar Iqbal Sub 
Inspector (PW-10) who after receiving information of the occurrence 
reached at the place of occurrence where Nazeer Ahmad, complainant (PW-
4) submitted before him a written complaint (Exh.PF) for registration of FIR 
(Exh.PF/3). After recording police proceedings on Exh.PF, PW-7 
transmitted the same to police station for registration of FIR, he pen down 
the stances of Sharjeel and Muhammad Usman, security guards who after 
apprehending the appellant at the spot, handed over his custody to PWs, 
upon which he formally arrested the appellant, prepared injury statement and 
inquest report of deceased (Ex.PB) and (Ex.PC), respectively, sent the dead 
body for postmortem. He inspected the spot and prepared rough site plan of 
place of occurrence (Ex.PM), collected blood stained earth, took into 
possession three empties P.6/1-3 of pistol 30 bore, secured CCTV footage of 
occurrence from camera installed outside Al-Shifa Medical Store, took into 
possession last worn clothes of deceased, took into possession of CDRs, got 
prepared scaled site plan, recorded statements of witnesses under section 161 
of Cr.P.C, transmitted case property to the concerned offices for analysis. 
Ultimately, report under section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted.

4. 
The accused when charge sheeted, denied the prosecution case, 
whereupon, the prosecution examined Zafar Iqbal, Sub Inspector (PW-10) 
who had conducted investigation of this case; Nazeer Ahmad, complainant 
(PW-4) and Razia Asghar (PW-5) appeared in the witness box to depose 
about the ocular account and Dr. Shazia Iftikhar (PW-1) had conducted 
postmortem examination on the dead body of the deceased Mst. Najma 
Asghar, the rest of the witnesses were formal in nature. On closure of 
prosecution case, the accused when examined under section 342 Cr.P.C. 
denied the prosecution evidence. However, he neither produced any witness 
in defence nor opted to appear in the witness box as required by section 
340(2) Cr.P.C. and the trial ended in the terms as detailed in opening 
paragraph of this judgment. 
5. 
We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties at 
considerable length and perused the record with their assistance. 
6. 
Though the FIR (Exh.PF/3) was promptly lodged i.e. within 45 
minutes of the occurrence but we are surprised to note that according to 
statement of Dr. Shazia Iftikhar (PW-1), she conducted autopsy on the dead 
body of the deceased on 05.07.2021 at 03:15 p.m. According to her, the dead 
body of the deceased was brought by Atia Shahzadi, 4731/L.C (PW-8) at 
11:05 a.m., but postmortem examination was conducted on the same day at 
03:15 p.m. Thus there is delay of seven hours and fifteen minutes in 
conducting the post mortem examination on the dead body of deceased. The 
prosecution has not brought any iota of evidence to justify the inordinate 
delay in postmortem examination of the deceased. In such eventuality the 
most natural inference would be that the delay so caused was for preliminary 
investigation and prior consultation to nominate the accused and plant eye-
witnesses of the occurrence. In case titled, "Irshad Ahmad v. The State" 
(2011 SCMR 1190) the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed 
that noticeable delay in postmortem examination on the dead body of the 
deceased is generally suggestive of a real possibility that time had been 
consumed by the police in procuring and planting eye-witnesses before 
preparing police papers necessary for the same. Same view has been 

 
M.R.No.267 of 2022 
Crl.A.No.63866 of 2022  
 
4
 
 
reaffirmed in case titled “Imtiaz Hussain Shah alias Tajjay Shah and another 
vs. The State and others” (2025 SCMR 1110). 
7. 
Having scrutinized the ocular evidence with the requisite degree of 
care, we find the testimony of the star prosecution witnesses, namely Nazeer 
Ahmad, complainant (PW-4) and Mst. Razia Asghar (PW-5) to be inherently 
unreliable and unworthy of credence for the purposes of sustaining a capital 
conviction. The very genesis of their presence at the scene is shrouded in 
improbability. Razia Asghar (PW-5), the mother of the deceased, claims to 
have been unwell and for the purpose of her check up she alongwith Nazeer 
Ahmad, complainant (PW-4), Moula Bakhash (given up PW) and Mst. 
Najma Asghar (deceased) proceeded towards the hospital on the fateful day. 
This arrangement for a routine medical visit strikes the Court as unusual and 
unexplained because it does not appeal to mind that for taking medicine of 
Mst. Razia Asghar (PW-5) four persons would accompany together for the 
said purpose. Even no prescription of her ailment has been brought on record 
to justify her stance for medical check up or getting medicine. Furthermore, 
the conduct of the complainant, Nazeer Ahmad (PW-4), who is also the 
maternal uncle of the deceased, and is resident of 40 kilometers away from 
the place of occurrence, immediately following the tragic incident, is 
negating to that of a natural witness. His admission that he did not inform 
the emergency services (Rescue 15 or 1122) about the occurrence betrays a 
passivity that undermines the veracity of his claim of being present. Even he 
did not know who informed the police about the occurrence. Most critically, 
Nazeer Ahmad, complainant (PW-4) when was confronted with his initial 
account in the written complaint (Ex.PF) he failed to satisfactorily explain a 
material improvement in his testimony regarding the locale of firearm 
injuries, attempting to align his testimony with the post-mortem report. 
Besides both witnesses are not only closely related to the deceased but are 
also "interested" witnesses with a clear motive to ensure conviction, their 
evidence, already weakened by the aforementioned infirmities, cannot be 
accepted for confirming the death sentence, hence the same is discarded 
accordingly.  
8. 
According to Zafar Iqbal, Sub Inspector (PW-10), on the day of 
occurrence i.e. 05.07.2021 when after receiving information of the 

 
M.R.No.267 of 2022 
Crl.A.No.63866 of 2022  
 
5
 
 
occurrence, he reached the place of occurrence, Sharjeel and Muhammad 
Usman, Security Guards, who had already apprehended the appellant at the 
spot, produced the appellant before him, therefore, said Sharjeel and 
Muhammad Usman, Security Guards were the most material and impartial 
witnesses of the occurrence and they could have at least confirmed the 
presence of the alleged eye-witnesses at the spot at the time of occurrence. 
Even Moulla Bakhash (given up PW) who was also witness of ocular of 
ocular account has not been produced by the prosecution and he was given 
up. Thus the prosecution withheld the best evidence. Thus under Article 
129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, an adverse inference can be 
drawn that if they had testified, their statements would not have supported 
the prosecution’s case. Reliance is placed on the case of “Imtiaz Hussain 
Shah alias Tajjay Shah and another vs. The State and others” (2025 SCMR 
1110). 
9. 
Oral and medical evidence also contradicts each other. In the FIR 
(Exh.PF/3) the role assigned to the appellant is as under:- 
ر اسےنم اھچیت رپ ےگل اور ان  ک
 
رےئک وج دو افئ

Contrary to above, Dr. Shazia Iftikhar (PW-1) while conducting post 
mortem of Mst. Najma Asghar, deceased noted following injuries:- 
“Injury No.1A 
A firearm wound of entry 2 x 2 cm on the left front of the chest, 
2 cm away from midline, 10 cm above the left nipple of breast. 
Injury No.1B 
A firearm wound of exit 1 x 1 cm on the right back of the chest, 
8 cm away from the midline, 3 cm below from the tip of the 
scapula. 
Injury No.2A 
A firearm wound of entry 2 x 2 cm on the medial side of the 
right knee joint.  
Injury No.2B 
A firearm wound of exit 3 x 1.5 cm on the right back of the 
thigh, 3 cm above the right knee joint. 
Injury No.3 
A graze wound 6 x 3 cm on the right side of back of right lower 
leg. 3 cm from right knee joint.” 
 

 
M.R.No.267 of 2022 
Crl.A.No.63866 of 2022  
 
6
 
 
The complainant in the FIR as also while appearing as (PW-4) has ascribed 
two fire arm injuries on the chest of the deceased to the appellant but during 
post mortem examination only one injury i.e. Injury No.1-A was noted on 
the chest of the deceased. Moreover, Injury No.3 i.e. grazed wound on back 
of right lower leg was never ascribed to the appellant in the FIR. This 
disparity calls into question the validity of the evidence used against the  
appellant. Reliance in this respect is placed on the judgment reported as 
“Muhammad Abras vs. The State” (2025 SCMR 1145).   
10. 
The manner in which the weapon of offence pistol (P-1) was 
recovered again merits our appraisal. According to Zafar Iqbal, Sub 
Inspector (PW-10) on the day of occurrence i.e. 05.07.2021 when after 
receiving information of the occurrence, he reached at the place of 
occurrence, where Sharjeel and Muhammad Usman, Security Guards, who 
had already apprehended the appellant at the spot, produced before him the 
custody of appellant but as gleaned from the record the weapon of offence, a 
30-bore pistol, was retrieved upon the pointation of Muhammad Hussain, 
appellant on 13.07.2021 from beneath bricks lying near City Pharmacy, 
Millat Road, Faisalabad. It is not understandable that if the appellant was 
apprehended by Sharjeel and Muhammad Usman, Security Guards at the 
spot then how the appellant managed to hide weapon of offence under bricks 
lying on Millat Road, Faisalabad. Placing reliance on a recovery made from 
an open and accessible place is unsafe because it cannot be said that the 
recovery had been effected from the exclusive possession of the appellant, as 
held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Usman 
Ahmed and another vs. The State through Advocate General, Islamabad” 
(2025 SCMR 1442). In so far positive report of PFSA qua matching of 
abovementioned pistol with the crime empties taken into possession from 
the place of occurrence is concerned, without discussing the merits and 
demerits of this piece of the prosecution evidence, it is noteworthy that as 
we have already disbelieved the direct prosecution evidence, therefore, the 
conviction and sentence of the appellant cannot be maintained merely on the 
basis of positive report of PFSA (Exh.PQ). 
11. 
So far as the motive part of the prosecution case is concerned, it was 
alleged by Nazeer Ahmad, complainant (PW-4) that appellant intended to 

 
M.R.No.267 of 2022 
Crl.A.No.63866 of 2022  
 
7
 
 
marry with Mst. Najma Asghar deceased, who refused to marry with the 
appellant. Nazeer Ahmad, complainant (PW-4) during cross-examination 
admitted that:- 
“The accused had not sent any of his relative or respectable to 
demand the hands (رشتہ) of deceased for marriage. He had also 
not sent any message through his relative to us in this regard. 
Except me and witnesses, we did not produce any person before 
investigating officer to substantiate the plea of motive……..” 
 
Similarly, Razia Asghar (PW-5) admitted during cross-examination as 
under:- 
“Prior to instant occurrence, the accused had not send his 
mother or other relative for hands of my daughter. Except 
myself and PWs of the case non from others joined 
investigation to corroborate out motive part……..” 
 
Above excerpts clearly show that the motive introduced by the prosecution 
is nothing except words of mouth and the prosecution failed to bring on 
record any independent and confidence inspiring evidence to prove the 
motive in this case. 
12. 
So far as the prosecution’s reliance on the CDR (Call Data Record) 
(Exh.PE/1-11) of mobile phone numbers of the appellant and the deceased 
are concerned, it is noteworthy that the same is of no avail to the prosecution 
because the same merely shows contact between the deceased and the 
appellant from 03.07.2021 to 05.07.2021. It does not show the location of 
the appellant on the date and time of occurrence at the place of occurrence 
thus the same is of no avail to the prosecution. Again, the names of the 
appellant as well as deceased were absent from the CDR (Exh.PE/1-11). 
Most importantly, the CDR was in the form of a standard computerized 
document which, admittedly, could be printed and prepared with the help of 
any computer. Moreover, the CDR without any signature of the concerned 
officer of the cellular/telecom company issuing the CDR could not be 
considered for the purpose of trial and relied upon, hence, the same cannot 
be believed for conviction of appellant. Reliance is placed upon case titled 
Khair Muhammad and another Vs. The State (2025 SCMR 1599). 
13. 
In so far as recovery of CCTV footage taken through USB from the 
place of occurrence is concerned, it is noteworthy that scaled and unscaled 
site plans are silent to installation of any CCTV camera at the place of 

 
M.R.No.267 of 2022 
Crl.A.No.63866 of 2022  
 
8
 
 
occurrence. Moreover, according to I.O. computer operater of the police 
station handed over him the USB containing footage of the occurrence on 
the day of occurrence but the same was transmitted to the office of PFSA on 
27.08.2021 for the reasons best known to the I.O. Moreover, Zafar Iqbal, SI 
(PW-10) admitted during cross-examination that he did not record statement 
of any of the relevant person of Al-Shifa Pharmacy under section 161 
Cr.P.C. Under such circumstances, more importantly, when ocular account 
of the prosecution fails, the positive report of PFSA qua CCTV footage is 
not worthy of reliance.  
14. 
As far as the defence plea taken by the appellant in his statement 
under Section 342, Code of Criminal Procedure is concerned, since the 
prosecution evidence is doubtful in nature, therefore, there is no need to 
discuss the same which is exculpatory in nature. 
15. 
For what has been discussed above, in the instant case the prosecution 
has totally failed to establish the charge against the accused/appellant 
beyond any shadow of doubt and it is trite that to extend benefit of doubt to 
an accused person, it is not necessary that there should be several 
circumstances creating doubt, rather one reasonable doubt is sufficient to 
acquit an accused. Reliance is placed on the case “MUHAMMAD IMRAN 
versus The STATE” (2020 SCMR 857). Consequently, Criminal Appeal 
No.63866 of 2022 is allowed and the accused/appellant is acquitted of the 
charge. He shall be released forthwith if not required in any other case.  
16. 
Murder Reference No.267 of 2022 is answered in the negative and the 
sentence of death awarded to Muhammad Hussain, convict is not confirmed.
