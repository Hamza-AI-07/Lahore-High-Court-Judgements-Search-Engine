  SADIQ MAHMUD KHURRAM, J.- Through this petition filed 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 the following prayer has been made:- 
“It is most respectfully prayed that the instant writ petition 
may kindly be accepted and impugned order dated 04-10-
2021 on the application of respondent No 4 passed by learned 
respondent No 1 may kindly be declared illegal, and against 
law and facts of the case, be set aside the same and the 
application U/S 22-A Cr.P.C of the Respondent No 4 may 
kindly be dismissed in the interest of justice and equity. 
 
2.             Brief facts of the case leading up to the filing of this petition 
are that the respondent No.4 namely Ghafooran Bibi , moved an 
application under section 22-A/22-B Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898, complaining of the non-registration of the F.I.R. by the police

authorities. The respondent No.4 had asserted in her application that 
the accused, including the petitioner, named by her in her application, 
had deprived her of inheriting property of her deceased husband. That 
upon the said application filed under section 22-A/22-B Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 by the respondent No.4, the learned Ex-
Officio Justice of Peace, Burewala vide his order dated 04.10.2021, 
directed the registration of the F.I.R. against the petitioner and the 
others. 
3.              Learned counsel for the petitioner inter-alia contended that 
the order passed by Ex-Officio Justice of Peace, Burewala, District 
Bahawalpur dated 04.10.2021 was liable to be set aside being against 
the facts and law; that the learned Ex-Officio Justice of Peace 
misconstrued the facts of the case; that the perusal of the application 
as filed by respondent No.4 did not reveal commission of any 
cognizable offence, hence, the impugned order was liable to be set 
aside.  
4.                The learned Assistant Advocate General has submitted that 
no cognizable offence had been committed, hence no order for 
registration of an F.I.R. could have been passed.    
5.       I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the 
learned Assistant Advocate General and perused the documents 
appended with this writ petition as well as the impugned order 
dated 04.10.2021 passed by the learned Ex-Officio Justice of Peace, 
Burewala.   
6.         The record evinces that the respondent No.4 namely 
Ghafooran Bibi, moved an application under section 22-A/22-B Code 

W.P No. 15477  of 2021

of Criminal Procedure, 1898, complaining of the non-registration of 
the F.I.R. by the police authorities. The respondent No.4 had asserted 
in her application that the accused, including the petitioner, named by 
her in her application, had deprived her of inheriting property of her 
deceased husband. That upon the said application filed under section 
22-A/22-B Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 by the respondent No.4, 
the learned Ex-Officio Justice of Peace, Burewala vide his order dated 
04.10.2021, directed the registration of the F.I.R. against the petitioner 
and the others. A perusal of the application as filed under section 22-
A/22-B Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 by the respondent No.4 
reveals that in the application itself commission of an offence made 
punishable under section 498-A PPC had been complained of. The 
offence made punishable under section 498-A PPC is not a cognizable 
offence. Section 4(1) (f) defines cognizable offence as under:- 
(f) ‘‘Cognizable offence”, “cognizable case”: “Cognizable 
offence” means an offence for, and cognizable case” means a 
case in which a police officer, may, in accordance with the 
second Schedule or under any law for the time being in force, 
arrest without warrant.” 
 
Section 4(1) (n) defines non-cognizable offence as under:- 
 
(n) “Non-cognizable offence,” “Non-cognizable case”: “Non-
cognizable offence means an offence for, and “non-cognizable 
case” means a case in which a police officer, may not arrest 
without warrant. 
 
According to the Schedule-II of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898, police shall not arrest without warrant any person alleged to 
had committed the offence made punishable under section 498-A 
P.P.C. making the offence made punishable under section 498-A 

W.P No. 15477  of 2021

P.P.C. a non-cognizable offence. Obviously, an F.I.R cannot be 
ordered for the registration of a non-cognizable offence which 
section 498-A P.P.C is and which offence the respondent No.4 
namely Ghafooran Bibi had complained that the petitioner and the 
other accused had committed. The available material prima facie 
does not reveal commission of   any   cognizable   offence.   As is 
obvious, an F.I.R. cannot be registered with regard to a non-
cognizable offence. Moreover, according to the application the 
respondent No.4 namely Ghafooran Bibi, she was deprived of the 
inherited property of her deceased husband at the time of opening 
of succession and Inheritance mutation No. 641 of 17.05.2010 was 
got entered in the revenue record. The act of depriving a woman of 
inheriting property was made an offence as defined under section 
498-A P.P.C. by way of the Criminal Law (Third Amendment) Act 
of 2011 which received the ascent of president of Pakistan on 26th 
December, 2011. According to the application of the respondent 
No.4 herself she was deprived of her inheritance on 17.05.2010. 
Such an act had not been made punishable under section 498-A 
P.P.C. by then. Article 12 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 provides that  no person  would be punished for an 
act which was not punishable by law at the time of the act or 
omission. Article 12 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 reads as under:- 
“Article 12: Protection against retrospective punishment 
1. No law shall authorize the punishment of a person- 
a. for an act or omission that was not punishable by law at the time 
of the act or omission; or 

W.P No. 15477  of 2021 
 
5 
 
b. for an offence by a penalty greater than, or of a kind different 
from, the penalty prescribed by law for that offence at the time the 
offence was committed 
2. Nothing in clause (1) or in Article 270 shall apply to any law 
making acts of abrogation or subversion of a Constitution in force 
in Pakistan at any time since the twenty-third day of March, one 
thousand nine hundred and fifty-six, an offence.” 
According to Bennion on Statutory Interpretation (Seventh Edition), 
page 181 with regard to the retrospectivity effect of law, it was said 
that “principle is sometimes expressed in the maxim lex prospicit non 
respicit (law looks forward not back). As Willes J said in Phillips v 
Eyre retrospective legislation is ‘contrary to the general principle that 
legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated ought, 
when introduced for the first time, to deal with future acts, and ought 
not to change the character of past transactions carried on upon the 
faith of the then existing law.” Whereas in Crawford’s Statutory 
Construction, 
Chapter 
XXV, 
germane 
to 
Prospective 
and 
Retrospective Operation, at pages 562 to 566 and 622, the gist of the 
discussion is that retroactive legislation is looked upon with disfavor, 
as a general rule, and properly so because of its tendency to be unjust 
and oppressive. There is a presumption that the legislature intended its 
enactments to have this effect to be effective only in future. This is 
true because of the basic presumption that the legislature does not 
intend to enact legislation which operates oppressively and 
unreasonably. If perchance any reasonable doubt exists, it should be 
resolved in favour of prospective operation. In other words, before a 
law will be construed as retrospective, its language must imperatively 
and clearly require such construction.. In the case of People v Dilliard 
(298 N.Y.S. 296, 302, 252 Ap. Div.125) Court held that "It is chiefly 
where the enactment would prejudicially affect vested rights, or the 

W.P No. 15477  of 2021 
 
6 
 
legal character of past transactions that the rule in question applies. 
Every statute, it has been said, which takes away or impairs vested 
rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, or 
imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability in respect of 
transactions or considerations already past, must be presumed, out of 
respect to the Legislature, to be intended not to have a retrospective 
operation." The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of 
“MUHAMMAD FAZAL and others versus SAEEDULLAH KHAN and 
others” (2011 SCMR 1137)  has held as under:- 
“2. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and going 
through the relevant record of the case appended with this petition 
we have straightaway observed that for allowing the Writ Petition 
filed by respondent No. 1 and for remanding his complaint under 
the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 to the learned Sessions Judge, 
Islamabad for holding further proceedings in connection with the 
same the learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Islamabad High Court, 
Islamabad had squarely relied upon the judgment rendered by this 
Court in the case of Rahim Tahir v. Ahmed Jan and 2 others (PLD 
2007 SC 423) without appreciating that the said judgment had 
expressly been overruled by this Court in the later case of Dr. 
Muhammad Safdar v. Edward Henry Louis (PLD 2009 SC 404). In 
the latter judgment this Court had clarified that the penal 
provisions contained in the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 could 
not be given retrospective effect in view of the provisions of 
Article 12(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973. It is not disputed before us that the alleged 
dispossession of respondent No.1 had come about in the year 2002, 
i.e. about three years before introduction of the Illegal 
Dispossession Act, 2005 and, thus, the said Act had no 
retrospective application to the case in hand.” 
 
Exposing a person to investigative process and face rigors of 
criminal prosecution is a no small measure; there must exist 
reasonable and tangible material, with evidential basis to set the law 
into motion so as to bring about an indictment. The insertion of 
section 22-A(6)(iii) was never meant to necessary allow every such 

W.P No. 15477  of 2021 
 
7 
 
application else the legislature would not have used word 'may' in 
subsection (6) which (word may) always speaks of 'discretion' by 
application of mind. Thus, it is settled law that the Ex Officio, 
Justice of Peace may refuse to issue direction regarding registration 
of case and may competently dismiss application under section 22-
A(6), Cr.P.C.,  
7. 
 
For the above identified reasons, it is a fit case for 
interference and invalidation of the impugned order. Therefore, by 
allowing this petition, impugned order dated 04.10.2021 passed by 
the learned Ex-Officio Justice of Peace, Burewala, is set-aside.
