------------------------ 
 
 
Aalia Neelum, J: - Muhammad Bilal, son of Amanat Ali, 
resident of Chak Kirpa Ram, Tehsil & District Pakpattan, the appellant was 
involved in case F.I.R. No.724 of 2018, registered on 04.08.2018, under 
Sections 302, 34 PPC, at Police Station, Township, District Lahore and was 
tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore. The trial court seized 
with the matter in terms of the judgment dated 16.06.2021, convicted the 
appellant-Muhammad Bilal, under Section 302(b) PPC, and sentenced him 
to rigorous imprisonment for life as Tazeer with the direction to pay 
Rs.5,00,000/- as compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased and in case 
of default in payment thereof, the appellant would further undergo simple 
imprisonment for six months. The benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. was also 
extended in favour of the appellant.  
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the trial court's judgment, Muhammad 
Bilal, the appellant, has assailed his conviction through the instant criminal 
appeal, i.e., Crl. Appeal No.56380 of 2021. The complainant, dissatisfied 
with the impugned judgment dated 16.06.2021, preferred a Criminal 
Revision No.42144 of 2021 for awarding death sentence to respondent 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

No.1/appellant. As both matters arise from the same judgment, they are 
being disposed of through a single judgment.   
3. 
 
The prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex.PH) lodged on 
the statement (Ex.PA) of Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant is 
that he deals in fruits. On 04.08.2018 at about 04:45 p.m., his brother 
Nadeem was selling mangoes on his loader rickshaw while standing in front 
of Al-Fazal Restaurant at Barkat Chowk, and the complainant (PW-1) was 
also selling mangoes near his brother. Meanwhile, Muhammad Bilal (the 
appellant), Rizwan (co-accused since acquitted), and one unknown accused 
came in a Chingchi rickshaw. Muhammad Bilal (the appellant) raised his 
voice not to let Nadeem live. After that, Rizwan (co-accused since acquitted) 
and an unknown accused caught hold the arms of the brother of the 
complainant and Muhammad Bilal (the appellant) took out “Churri” from 
his “Dabb” and inflicted “Churri” blow on the right side of chest of the 
brother of the complainant, who fell on the ground. The complainant (PW-1) 
called 1122 and shifted the injured to Emergency of Jinnah Hospital, where 
he succumbed to the injuries. The motive behind the occurrence was that the 
accused persons used to sell mangoes after purchasing from the complainant 
party. The accused persons purchased mangoes, which were found rotten, 
and one day before the occurrence, the accused persons extended threats of 
dire consequences to the complainant's brother. The occurrence was 
witnessed by Allah Ditta (PW-2) and Muhammad Imran (given up PW).  
4. 
 
Upon receiving the information of the occurrence at 15, 
Muhammad Iqbal S.I (PW-9) reached Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, where the 
complainant (PW-1) got recorded his statement (Ex. PA) before him (PW-
9), who, after completing police karawai sent the same to the Police Station 
through Amin 5262/HC (not cited as a witness), after that formal F.I.R. 
(Exh. PH) was chalked out by Muhammad Arshad, ASI (PW-5). 
5. 
 
After registration of the case, the investigation of this case was 
entrusted to Aurangzaib, S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, who, having 
found the accused/appellant guilty, prepared a challan and sent the same to 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021 
 
3
the court of competent jurisdiction while placing the names of all accused 
persons in Column No.3 of the challan. On 12.07.2019, the trial court 
formally charge-sheeted the appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty and 
claimed trial. In support of its version, the prosecution produced as many as 
nine (09) witnesses. 
6. 
 
The ocular account in this case consists of the statements of 
Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, and Allah Ditta (PW-2). Dr. 
Abdul Sattar (PW-4) deposed that on 05.08.2018, he conducted postmortem 
examination on the body of the deceased, Muhammad Nadeem, and found 
the following injuries on his person: -   
INJURIES. 
1 
A spindle-shaped incised wound size 3 X 2 
CM on the right lower part of the front of the 
chest. It was running obliquely. It was 10 
C.M infromedial to right nipple. It was 7 
C.M. from the midline. On dissection, muscle 
in the space between the 4th and 5th rib was 
incised, 
and 
pericardium 
and 
heart 
incised/cut. 2 liters of clotted and un-clotted 
blood recovered from the thoracic cavity.  
 
 
After conducting the postmortem examination, the doctor 
rendered the following opinion: - 
OPINION 
“Injury stated above was ante-mortem and caused 
by sharp edge weapon. The cause of death in this 
case was injury to the vital organ, the heart, 
leading to profuse hemorrhage shock and death. 
The said injury was sufficient to cause death in the 
ordinary course of nature. The time between 
death and postmortem was 09 to 12 hours.”  
Ex. PG is the correct carbon copy of the 
postmortem 
report, 
whereas 
Ex.PG/1 
and 
Ex.PG/2 are pictorial diagrams of injuries.  
The statements of the remaining prosecution witnesses are formal. 
7. 
 
The learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor gave up PW, 
Imran being unnecessary, and closed the prosecution evidence on 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

20.05.2021 after tendering the reports of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore (Ex. PU, Ex. PV and Ex. PW).   
8. 
 
After the closure of the evidence, the appellant was examined 
under Section 342 of Cr.P.C., wherein he neither opted to appear as his own 
witness in terms of Section 340 (2) Cr.P.C nor produced any evidence in his 
defence. While replying to the question of why this case was against him 
and why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant made the following 
deposition: - 
“In fact Muhammad Nadeem was murdered by 
the second husband of widow of Nadeem. Widow 
of deceased Nadeem had affair with her second 
husband before marriage and due to this affair 
second husband of widow committed the murder 
of Nadeem. Just after the death of Nadeem his 
widow entered into second marriage and left her 
daughter at the house of legal heirs of deceased. 
I and Muhammad Rizwan were aware regarding 
said affair due to which complainant implicated 
me and co-accused falsely in order to save his 
honor. Complainant, witnesses and deceased 
were not residents of Lahore. I and Muhammad 
Rizwan were residing at Lahore but we were not 
willing to become witness of complainants case 
due to said grudge complainant implicated me 
and Rizwan falsely. After the occurrence 
Pinchayat regarding compromise was also held. 
I and Rizwan gave proof regarding our 
innocence but complainant implicated us falsely. 
PW 
Imran 
was 
not 
willing 
to 
support 
complainants version due to which complainant 
give up his evidence. Complainant demanded 
money from me and co-accused Rizwan. 
Witnesses 
gave 
false 
evidence 
with 
the 
connivance of complainant and police. In fact I 
was arrested by the police from the first day of 
occurrence when I visited the police station with 
complainant party.”  
9. 
 
After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence available 
on record in the light of the arguments advanced by both sides, the trial court 
found the prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable 
doubt, which resulted in the appellant's conviction in the afore-stated terms.

I have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for 
the parties and Deputy Prosecutor General and have minutely perused the 
record on the file.  
11. 
 
The occurrence occurred on 04.08.2018 at 04.45 p.m. on the 
roadside at Barkat Chowk in front of Al-Feezan Restaurant, situated within 
the jurisdiction of Police Station Township, District Lahore, which is at a 
distance of one (01) Kilometer only from the place of occurrence. As per the 
prosecution case, Muhammad Nadeem, brother of the complainant (PW-1) 
Muhammad Saleem, was stabbed with a knife by the appellant, Muhammad 
Bilal, and Muhammad Nadeem (then injured) was shifted by rescue 1122 
from the place of occurrence to Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, emergency, but 
before reaching Hospital, Muhammad Nadeem the injured succumbed to the 
injury. Upon receiving information about the fight, Muhammad Iqbal S.I. 
(PW-9) reached the place of the occurrence. When he reached there, he 
found out that the injured had been taken by 1122 to the emergency of 
Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, where Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant 
got recorded Fard Bayyan (Ex.PA) to Muhammad Iqbal S.I. (PW-9) at 05:40 
p.m. and signed (Ex. PA/1) by him. Muhammad Iqbal S.I. (PW-9) 
incorporated police proceedings (Ex. PA/3). The incident was not reported 
to the police at the Police Station. F.I.R. (Exh.PH) was registered on the oral 
statement (Exh.PA) of Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, on 
04.08.2018 at 06:00 p.m. It is clear from the Fard Bayan (Exh. PA) that the 
statement of Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, was recorded by 
Muhammad Iqbal S.I. (PW-9) at the emergency of Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, 
at 05:40 p.m. Contrary to the above, Muhammad Iqbal S.I. (PW-9) deposed 
during examination-in-chief that: - 
“Stated that on 04.08.2018 I was posted at 
P.S. Township Lahore. After receiving the 
information of occurrence I reached at the 
place of occurrence from where I proceeded 
for 
Jinnah 
Hospital, 
Lahore 
where 
complainant Muhammad Saleem met me 
and handed over to me his written statement 
Ex.PA 
bearing 
signature 
and 
thumb

& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

impression 
of 
complainant. 
I 
drafted 
complaint Ex.PA/3 and sent it at police 
station through constable Amin for the 
registration of case.” 
Muhammad Iqbal S.I. (PW-9) deposed during cross-examination that he 
reached the hospital at 05:00 p.m. The relevant portion of the cross-
examination reads as follows: - 
“Dead body was shifted in emergency ward 
by 1122. Death certificate was received by 
me. I reached at hospital at about 05:00 PM. 
Complainant gave to me 
his written 
statement which had been written by him 
before my arrival.” 
 
 
According to Muhammad Iqbal S.I. (PW-9), when he reached 
the hospital, he received the dead body of the deceased. According to him, 
the deceased died at 05 in the evening, and Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the 
complainant, made his statement before him for registration of the case, and 
he reduced to writing the statement of Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the 
complainant, same was read over to him, and he accepted as correct. The 
scanned copy of the police proceedings incorporated (Ex. PA/3) is as 
follows:

Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-
examination that: -  
“On the day of occurrence I visited police 
station after about two hours. Police visited 
hospital. I filed application at police station 
again said at hospital. I am under metric. I 
did 
not 
write 
myself 
application 
for 
registration of case. Application was written 
by police. I narrated the occurrence to the 
police and application was prepared on the 
basis of said information. My statement was 
recorded by Iqbal ASI. Police reached at 
hospital after half hour. 2/3 other police 
officials were also present with Iqbal ASI. I 
cannot tell their names and designations. 
Zahid Iqbal, Allah Ditta, Imran and 2/3 
other relatives also reached at hospital. I 
cannot tell the name of doctor and medical 
staff who met us at hospital. Time was about 
04:30/05:00 PM. We remained present at 
hospital for about half hour.” 
Contrary to the deposition of Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, 
Allah Ditta (PW-2), the first cousin of the complainant and eye witness, 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Iqbal ASI reached at hospital. We narrated 
occurrence to the police. Application was 
given to the police which was written by 
Orangzaib. Orangzaib is not my relative. 
Orangzaib is police officer. On the day of 
occurrence I visited the police station at 
about 06:30 PM. Police officials also left with 
us when we proceeded for police station. We 
were in police vehicle. We reached at police 
station at about 07:00 PM. We did not stop 
anywhere on the way to the police station. 
We filed application at police station. 
Application regarding occurrence was given 
in 
police 
station. 
Muhammad 
Saleem 
complainant gave said application. Faisal 
ASI visited hospital. I cannot tell the time for 
which we remained at police station. My 
statement was recorded by police at police 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

station. My statement was recorded by 
Orangzaib police officer. After leaving police 
station we went to hospital. I cannot tell the 
time of reaching hospital. We remained 
present at hospital till 04:00 AM. Police 
again visited the hospital. Name of police 
official is not remember to me. ----------I have 
good memory. After taking dead body we 
went to our native Town.” 
The matter can also be examined from another angle; in the inquest report 
(Exh.PF) in column No.3, related to the time of information received about 
the occurrence, it was mentioned at 05:25 p.m. on 04.08.2018. The contents 
of column No.3 of inquest report (Exh.PF) are reproduced hereunder,

It is mentioned in column No.8 of the inquest report (Exh. PF) 
that the mouth was open. The prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad 
Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, and Allah Ditta (PW-2), deposed in their 
court statements that they were with Muhammad Nadeem (then injured) 
when he was shifted to the hospital and before reaching the hospital, he 
succumbed to the injuries. If they attended to the deceased and he took his 
last breath in the rescue 1122 ambulance, then there was no reason for the 
mouth to be open. The medical staff always treat the body with dignity and 
respect; position the body in a supine position with anatomical alignment 
and close eyes and mouth if open. The second external check that is equally 
important is sending a copy of the FIR along with the dead body for post-
mortem examination and its reference in the inquest report (Exh. PF). In the 
column of the brief history of the inquest report (Exh. PF), Aurangzaib S.I. 
(PW-8)-the investigating officer, specifically mentioned that a case has been 
registered and he is proceeding for investigation of the crime to the place of 
occurrence and others along with other police officers. Even then, it was not 
mentioned that FIR was also sent along with other documents with the dead 
body for post-mortem examination. The absence of these details in the 
inquest report may indicate that the FIR was not registered and was recorded 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

after due deliberations and consultation. The scanned copy of the relevant 
portion of the inquest report (Ex. PF) reads as follows: -  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These facts create doubt in the prosecution case and the credibility and 
truthfulness of the statements of prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad 
Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, and Allah Ditta (PW-2). This also creates 
doubt about the genuineness of the version given by prosecution witnesses, 
i.e., Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, and Allah Ditta (PW-2). I 
further noticed that Doctor Abdul Sattar (PW-4) conducted the post-mortem 
examination of the dead body of Muhammad Nadeem. Doctor Abdul Sattar 
(PW-4) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Dead body had arrived at hospital before 
starting of my duty timing. Dead body was 
received at 06:50 PM at dead house on 
04.08.2018. 
--------------I 
conducted 
postmortem at 03:00 AM on 05.08.2018. I 
conducted postmortem after about seven 
hours from the starting time of my duty. I 
received police papers on 05.08.2018 at 02:45 
AM. I received police papers after about 
eight hours of receiving dead body in the 
dead 
house. 
--------------I 
conducted 
postmortem with the delay of eight hours 
due to non availability of police papers. 
Police handed over to me police papers with 
delay. Injury mentioned in postmortem 
report may not be caused by simple blade. 
Volunteered stated that it may be caused by 
sharp edge object having heavy blade.” 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

I noticed that death had not taken place at the time given by the 
prosecution witnesses, nor the witnesses were present at the spot, which also 
got support from the inquest report (Exh. PF), wherein the names of 
Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, and Allah Ditta (PW-2) were 
not mentioned. It indicated that the incident did not occur as stated by the 
prosecution. However, Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, and 
Allah Ditta (PW-2) deposed that they remained with Aurangzaib S.I. (PW-
8)-the investigating officer in hospital after the death of Muhammad 
Nadeem, the deceased. If he (PW-8) visited and prepared the inquest report 
(Exh. PF) and had met with Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, 
and Allah Ditta (PW-2). In that case, there is no reason why the names of 
the complainant and eyewitness are missing from the inquest report 
(Exh. PF). The absence of those details indicates that the prosecution 
story was still in the embryo and had not been given any shape. The FIR 
was recorded after due deliberations and consultations, and the FIR was then 
ante-timed. All these factual circumstances lead to the conclusion that 
relying upon the FIR in the instant case is unsafe. 
12. 
 
As per the prosecution version, “bloodstained Churri” (P-6) was 
recovered on the disclosure of the appellant Bilal and produced by him, the 
Deoxyribonucleic acid (abbreviated DNA) of Muhammad Nadeem, the 
deceased was matched with the swab taken from the blade of Churri (P-6). 
As per the report of Forensic DNA and Serology Analysis of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PU), the swabs were taken from items # 5.1 
and 5.2, the blade and handle of churri (P-6), and item # 5.1 was stained with 
human blood. As per the report, Forensic DNA and Serology Analysis 
(Supplementary-I) of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PW) reveals 
that a swab taken from the blade of Churri item # 5.1 matches the DNA 
profile of Muhammad Nadeem, the deceased. At the same time, the report, 
Forensic DNA and Serology Analysis (Supplementary-I) of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PW) reveals that a swab taken from the 
handle of Churri item # 5.2 did not match the DNA profile of Muhammad 
Rizwan (since acquitted) and Muhammad Bilal, the appellant. The relevant 
part of the report (Ex. PW) reads as follows: - 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021 
 
11
“The partial DNA profile obtained from item 
# 5.2 is consistent with the DNA profile of 
Muhammad Nadeem (item # 2). The 
probability 
of 
finding 
an 
unrelated 
individual at random in the population as 
being a source of the DNA obtained from 
item # 5.2 is approximately one in 71 
quadrillion in Caucasians. The genetic loci 
D21S11, CSF1PO and D2S1338 were not 
used for frequency calculations. Muhammad 
Rizwan (item # S1) and Muhammad Bilal 
(item # S2) are eliminated as being 
contributors to the DNA obtained from item 
# 5.2.”   
 
 
I have found from the evidence of Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C 
(PW-6), Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, that the accused 
were arrested on 20.08.2018. Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating 
officer, deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“On 20.08.2018 I arrested accused persons 
Bilal and Rizwan. -------------------------- On 
31.08.2018 at the disclosure and pointation of 
accused Bilal, a crime weapon bloodstained 
Churri P6 was recovered from his house. ----
---------------I 
prepared 
its 
sealed 
and 
stamped parcel and took it into possession 
through recovery memo Ex.PQ attested by 
Mudassar Shahzad H.C and Shakeel Ahmed 
constable. I recorded the statements of said 
witnesses. I further prepared site plan Ex.PT 
regarding the place of said recovery.” He 
(PW-8) deposed during cross-examination that, 
“On 31.08.2018 when I took accused Bilal for 
the purpose of recovery then door of his 
rented house was already opened.--------------
-Churri P6 was of ordinary nature which 
may be purchased from market. I did not 
mention 
in 
case 
diary 
that 
where 
complainant filed application for registration 
of case. Volunteered stated that application 
was filed at police station and said fact is 
mentioned in the proceedings of Muhammad 
Iqbal S.I.” 
Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6), deposed during examination-in-chief 
that: - 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021 
 
12
“On 31.08.2018 at the disclosure and 
pointation of accused Muhammad Bilal 
crime weapon Churri P6 was recovered from 
his rented house No.14-B-1 situated at 
Township Market lying under the wooden 
box from residential room wrapped in 
plastic shopper and paper and it was blood 
stained. I.O. prepared its sealed and stamped 
parcel and took into possession through 
recovery memo Ex.PQ attested by me and 
Shakeel Ahmad constable.” He (PW-6) 
deposed during cross-examination that, “When 
we visited the place of recovery then five / six 
persons were present in the house. Lady 
constable 
was 
not 
present 
with 
us. 
Volunteered stated that place of recovery 
was not residence of family and said rooms 
were got on rent by unmarried persons.” 
 
 
From the deposition of Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6), 
Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, it reveals that appellant 
Bilal, along with his co-accused (since acquitted), was arrested on 
20.08.2018; the appellant, Bilal, made disclosure and led to the recovery of 
crime weapon and produced a crime weapon. i.e., blood-stained knife (P-6) 
on 31.08.2018 by the appellant, Muhammad Bilal. As per the prosecution 
case, appellant Bilal was arrested on 20.08.2018. Strangely, Aurangzeb S.I. 
(PW-8)-the investigating officer, received the accused persons and other 
photographs from Shakeel Ahmad Constable on 10.08.2018. Aurangzeb S.I. 
(PW-8)-the investigating officer could not retrieve the crime weapon on 
20.08.2018 when the arrest of the appellant Muhammad Bilal was shown, 
and the same was recovered on 31.08.2018, 11 days after his arrest from the 
accused’s house. Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer stated 
during cross-examination, that photographs of the place of occurrence were 
taken through a camera, and photographs of the accused persons were taken 
through a mobile phone. Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer 
prepared the photographs on 04.08.2018 and deposed during his 
examination-in-chief that: - 
“I also got photographs of the place of 
occurrence.”

The accused persons, i.e., Muhammad Bilal and Muhammad 
Rizwan (since acquitted), were in the custody of the police on 04.08.2018 as 
revealed from the deposition of Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating 
officer Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer and Mudassar 
Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6). The appellant, Muhammad Bilal, had the 
opportunity to conceal the weapon in his house. Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C 
(PW-6) deposed during examination-in-chief that on 10.08.2018, the I.O. 
took into possession photographs, including photographs of the accused 
persons. Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6) deposed during examination-in-
chief that: -   
“On 10.08.2018 I.O took into possession 09 
photographs of place of occurrence, deceased 
Muhammad Nadeem and accused persons 
P3/1-9 through recovery memo Ex.PN 
attested 
by 
me 
and 
Shakeel 
Ahmed 
constable.”   
Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6) deposed during cross-examination that: -   
“I don’t know the date when photographs 
P3/1-9 were got by the I.O via mobile phone 
camera. Volunteered stated that I.O took it 
into possession on 10.08.2018. In one 
photographs accused Rizwan is seen in 
handcuff. Said photographs were got before 
10.08.2018 due to which said were taken into 
possession on 10.08.2018.”   
Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, admitted that he received

Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-The investigating officer admitted that the 
photographs were received on 10.08.2018, and the photographs of the place

of occurrence and the accused persons were taken through cameras and 
mobile phones. He (PW-8) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I recorded the statement of Shakeel Ahmed 
constable on 10.08.2018 regarding the 
production of nine photographs by said 
constable 
to 
me. 
Ex.P-3/1-9 
are 
the 
photographs which were produced by 
constable Shakeel to me. Photographs 
regarding the place of occurrence were taken 
at the time of visit of place of occurrence and 
photographs of accused persons were taken 
after their arrest. It is correct that in 
photographs No.4 accused Rizwan is seen 
while handcuffed. Again stated that I cannot 
say it surely that accused Rizwan is 
handcuffed in said picture because no police 
official is present in said picture.-----------
Photographs of place of occurrence were 
taken through camera and photographs of 
accused persons were taken through mobile 
phone camera.” 
 
Moreover, it is noticed that Shakeel Ahmad 21046/Constable, 
who produced the photographs P-3/1-9 before Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the 
investigating officer on 10.08.2018, was shown witness of the recovery 
memo (Ex. PN). The scanned copy of the recovery memo of nine (9) 
photographs (Ex. PN) is as follows for reference: -  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

I have noted that the said Shakeel Ahmad 21046/Constable was 
not produced as a witness by the prosecution.  Thus, it was established from 
the recovery memo of possession of nine (9) photographs (Ex. PN) that 
Shakeel Ahmad 21046/Constable produced the nine (9) photographs (Ex. 
PN) on 10.08.2018 before Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, 
therefore, an adverse inference is to be drawn within the meaning of Article 
129 (g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 that had Shakeel Ahmad 
21046/Constable, been appeared as witness then his deposition would have 
been unfavorable to the prosecution.  Reliance is placed on the case reported 
as “The State and others   v.  Abdul Khaliq and others” (PLD 2011 SC 
554). The DNA test report, Forensic DNA and Serology Analysis 
(Supplementary-I) of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PW) reveals 
that sealed evidence of Buccal swab(s) of Muhammad Nadeem (the 
deceased) was submitted by Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer 
on 06.08.2018. Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer deposed 
during examination-in-chief that: - 
“PFSA team had also reached at the place of 
occurrence and handed over parcels to me. I 
took into possession said parcels through 
recovery memo Ex.PJ attested by Mudassar 
Shahzad and Shakeel Ahmed constables. I 
recorded the statements of witnesses u/s 161 
Cr.P.C.” 
Whereas Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer deposed during 
cross-examination that,  
"Crime scene unit team had arrived at the 
place of occurrence before my arrival. I 
perused documents given by crime scene 
unit. Said documents are not the part of 
police record/file." 
Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6) deposed during cross-examination that: -   
“I don’t know the date when photographs 
P3/1-9 were got by the I.O via mobile phone 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021

camera. Volunteered stated that I.O took it 
into possession on 10.08.2018. In one 
photographs accused Rizwan is seen in 
handcuff. Said photographs were got before 
10.08.2018 due to which said were taken into 
possession on 10.08.2018.”   
 
 
The prosecution evidence remained silent about the names of 
the members of the team of PFSA who handed over three parcels sealed 
having insignia of PFSA to Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer 
on 04.08.2018 and taken into possession through recovery memo (Ex. PJ) by 
Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer and who prepared said 
parcels. The prosecution failed to establish by convincing evidence when 
and where the alleged parcel of Buccal swab(s) of Muhammad Nadeem (the 
deceased) was secured. After securing a sealed parcel, the same was handed 
over to Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer. The Crime scene 
investigation report (Ex.PV) does not reveal where the team of PFSA 
collected the nail swab(s) and buccal swab(s) of Muhammad Nadeem (the 
deceased). As mentioned above, Mudassar Shahzad 1939/C (PW-6) and 
Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, deposed the PFSA team left 
in their presence from the place of occurrence. The Crime scene 
investigation report (Ex. PV) reveals that the dead body was not present at 
the spot when the PFSA team arrived at the place of the occurrence at 07:00 
p.m. on 04.08.2018. After that, the PFSA team visited the dead house of 
Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, and the dead body of Muhammad Nadeem, the 
deceased, was examined. The scanned copy of the relevant portion of the 
crime scene investigation report (Ex. PV) reads as follows: -  
 
 
 
 
 
 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021 
 
17
Contrary to the above, a scanned copy of the recovery memo of possession 
of three parcels with the seal of PFSA reads as under: - 
 
 
 
 
Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer on 04.08.2018 prepared un-
scaled site plan and he had deposed during his examination-in-chief that: - 
“I prepared un-scaled site plan Ex. PR 
regarding the place of occurrence. I also got 
photographs of the place of occurrence. ------
-- On 09.08.2018 draftsman prepared scaled 
site plan in triplicate and handed over to me. 
I gave red ink notes. I recorded the 
statement of draftsman in this regard.”  
 
 
The oral testimony is contrary to the documentary evidence in 
the shape of the un-scaled site plan (Exh.PR), revealing that at the bottom of 
the un-scaled site plan (Exh. PR) date is mentioned 09.08.2018 and not 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021 
 
18
04.08.2018. Besides the un-scaled site plan (Exh. PR), scaled site plans (Ex. 
PB and Ex. PB/1) revealed that the body buccal swab (s) and swab(s) 
collected from both hand nails on 09.08.2018 at the point “A,” which is the 
place of occurrence. The scanned copy of the un-scaled site plan (Exh. PR) 
is as follows: - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021 
 
19
 
 
 
 
Although the site plan is not a substantive piece of evidence in terms of 
Article 22 of the Qanune-e-Shahdat Order 1984 as held in the case of Mst. 
Shamim Akhtar v. Fiaz Akhter and two others (PLD 1992 SC 211), but it 
reflects the view of the crime scene, and the same can be used to contradict 
or disbelieve eyewitnesses. All these circumstances create doubt about the 
parcels prepared by the PFSA team and make the matching report of the 
swab taken from the blade of Churri item # 5.1 matches the DNA profile of 
Muhammad Nadeem, the deceased, doubtful.  
13. 
 
Besides, a bare reading of Section 510 Cr.P.C., a report of an 
expert is per se admissible without examination of the expert. It would be 
appropriate to quote Section 510 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which 
reads as follows: -  
“510. Report of Chemical Examiner, Serologist, etc. 
Any document purporting to be a report, under the hand 
of any Chemical Examiner or Assistant Chemical 
Examiner to Government [or of the Chief Chemist of 
Pakistan Security Printing Corporation, Limited] or any 
Serologist, fingerprint expert or fire-arm expert or the 
Chemist or the Pharmacist or the Forensic Scientist or 
Hand-writing expert appointed by Government upon 
any matter or thing duly submitted to him for 
examination or analysis and report in the course of any 
proceeding under this Code, may without calling him as 
a witness, be used as evidence in any inquiry, trial or 
other proceeding under this Code: Provided that the 
Court may [if it considers necessary in the interest of 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021 
 
20
justice] summon and examine the person by whom such 
report has been made.].” 
 
 
A bare reading of this Section makes it abundantly clear that the 
reports of the Chemical Examiner or Assistant Chemical Examiner to the 
Government [or of the Chief Chemist of Pakistan Security Printing 
Corporation, Limited] or any Serologist, fingerprint expert, or fire-arm 
expert or the Chemist or the Pharmacist or the Forensic Scientist or Hand-
writing expert are admissible per se without they being formally proved by 
the person who has made the same. It is in prosecution evidence that a team 
consisting of the members of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency inspected 
the place of occurrence, collected evidence, prepared three parcels 
separately, and handed them over to Aurangzeb S.I. (PW-8)-the 
investigating officer. The members of the PFSA team are not officers 
covered by Section 510 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and thus, the 
positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PW) is not 
conclusive and reliable in the absence of the officers above being examined 
in Court, who collected and prepared the parcels from the spot and prepared 
separate parcels to prove the fact that they collected evidence from the place 
of the occurrence and after that, they prepared parcels which were handed 
over to Aurangzaib, S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer. The report in 
question is of no help to the prosecution as there is nothing on record to 
prove that the three parcels alleged to have been made by the members of 
the PFSA team on the spot. Thus, there can be no dispute that it was 
incumbent upon the prosecution to produce members of the PFSA team who 
collected the crime empties and prepared separate parcels to prove the chain 
of safe custody. Without such proof, the PFSA report cannot corroborate the 
prosecution's case. 
14. 
 
The motive set up by the prosecution in the Fard Beyan (Exh. 
PA) and F.I.R. (Exh. PH), brought on the record through the deposition of 
Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant and Allah Ditta (PW-2) is that 
day before the occurrence the accused persons purchased mangoes from 
Muhammad Nadeem, the deceased and some mangoes were found rotten 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021 
 
21
due to the said reasons the accused persons gave threats of dire 
consequences to the deceased. To substantiate the motive part of the case, 
the prosecution produced Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant. In 
the cross-examination of Muhammad Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant 
deposed as under: - 
“I did not give any application regarding 
motive part of the occurrence at police 
station. In EX.PA I did not mention the time 
of motive part fight. In my evidence in court 
I did not give said time. In Ex.PA I did not 
give the name of witnesses of motive part of 
occurrence. in my statement in this court I 
have not mentioned names of the witnesses 
of motive part fight.” 
The defence brought on the record contradictions and conflicts in the 
evidence of Allah Ditta (PW-2); he deposed during cross-examination that: -  
“In my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. I did not 
submit that complainant was also used to sell 
fruit at his wheelbherro beside me. I told the 
police that deceased was also used to sell 
mangoes near by me on his loader Rikshaw. 
Confronted with Ex.DA where it is not so 
recorded. I told the I.O about the first aid 
which was given to the injured at spot. 
Confronted with Ex.DA where it is not so 
recorded. I told police about the motive part 
that accused persons committed the murder 
of deceased due to the dispute of rotten 
mangoes. Confronted with Exh.DA where 
motive part is not so recorded. I did not tell 
the I.O about the threats given by the 
accused persons before one day of the 
occurrence in my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. 
Time of quarrel, which took place before one 
day of the occurrence, is not remember to 
me. I did not give any application regarding 
the quarrel which took place before one day 
prior to the occurrence. Except me and 
Saleem no other witnesses regarding the 
fight, which took place before one day of the 
occurrence, appeared before police. It is 
correct that on my CNIC residential address 
is mentioned Hujra Shah Muqeem Tehsil 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021 
 
22
Deepalpur District Okara. Police recorded 
my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. I gave same 
address to the police while got recording my 
statement. I repeated same address in this 
court.” 
 
 
Therefore, the evidence led by the prosecution in connection 
with the motive is not sufficient to place reliance on the testimonies of the 
witnesses for committing the occurrence. Motive is a double-edged weapon 
for the occurrence and also for false implication. Different motives always 
operate in the person's mind when making false accusations. In the 
circumstances, I cannot avoid the conclusion that the alleged motive was an 
afterthought and has not been proved by any credible evidence.   
15. 
 
As it is difficult to rely upon the testimonies of Muhammad 
Saleem (PW-1)-the complainant, Allah Ditta (PW-2), and Aurangzeb, S.I. 
(PW-8)-the investigating officer and for other reasons enumerated 
hereinbefore, I am persuaded to hold that the prosecution had not been able 
to prove its case against the appellant, Muhammad Bilal, beyond shadow of 
doubt as there were many dents in the prosecution story.  The conviction and 
sentence the learned trial court recorded cannot be sustained.  Reliance has 
been placed on the case reported as “Muhammad Akram v. The State”  
(2009 SCMR 230), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has held 
that even a single circumstance creating reasonable doubts in a prudent mind 
about the guilt of the accused makes him entitled to the benefit, not as a 
matter of grace and concession but as a matter of right.  
16. 
 
The upshot of the above discussion is that the prosecution had 
severely failed to bring home a charge against the appellant, Muhammad 
Bilal, beyond any reasonable doubt; therefore, in the interest of the safe 
administration of Criminal Justice, Criminal Appeal No.56380 of 2021 filed 
by Muhammad Bilal, the appellant is accepted in toto.   The conviction and 
sentence awarded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore vide 
judgment dated 16.06.2021 is set aside, and the appellant, Muhammad Bilal, 
is ordered to be acquitted of the charge in case FIR No.724 of 2018 dated 
04.08.2018 offence under sections 302, 34 PPC registered at Police Station 

Crl. Appeal No.56380  of 2021  
& Crl. Rev. No.42144 of 2021 
 
23
Township, District Lahore and the appellant-Muhammad Bilal is directed to 
be released forthwith, if not required in any other criminal case. 
17. 
 
So far as Crl.Rev.No.42144 of 2021 seeking enhancement in 
the sentence of respondent No.1 inflicted by the trial court is concerned, for 
the afore-stated reasons, the same has no weight, which is accordingly 
dismissed. 
18. 
 
Prima facie, this Court does not find the Investigating Officer to 
have performed his duties of conducting a fair investigation. The 
investigation must be honest and transparent, as it is the minimum 
requirement of the Rule of law. The investigating agency cannot investigate 
in a tainted and biased manner. A copy of this Judgment shall be sent to the 
CCPO, Lahore, to look into the conduct of the investigating officer and the 
investigation conducted by him.
