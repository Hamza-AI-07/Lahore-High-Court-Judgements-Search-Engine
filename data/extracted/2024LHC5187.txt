SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:– Through 
this election petition the election-petitioner has called into 
question the election in NA-111 Nankana Sahib-I, inter 
alia, on the ground that respondent No. 8 (the ‘returned 
candidate’) has failed to disclose two properties 
measuring approximately 02-kanal and 01-marla given as 
gift to his sons namely M. Ammar Arshad Sahi and Attiq-
ur-Rehman Sahi, in his declaration filed along-with the 
nomination papers. Some other grounds as to corrupt and 
illegal practices on the polling day have also been taken. 
2. 
   
Sardar Abdul Majid Dogar-learned counsel 
for the returned candidate at the very outset, has raised 

 
E.P No. 18669 of 2024        
 
 
 
 
2 
several objections as to the maintainability of this election 
petition including that (i) the election petition is time 
barred, (ii) no affidavit of service is attached with this 
election petition, (iii) all the pages of the election petition 
are not signed as required by the Elections Act-2017 (the 
‘Act’), (iv) verification of the election petition as well as 
attached affidavits are not in accordance with law and (v) 
failure to disclose any benefit derived from alleged non-
disclosure, while contending that the same is in defiance 
of section 144(b) of the Act, which requires that full 
particulars of any corrupt or illegal practice or any other 
illegal act must be given in the election petition. He seeks 
outright dismissal of the election petition.  
3.  
 
Syed Muhammad Kaleem Ahmad Khurshid 
(learned Senior-ASC) has relied upon various judgments 
including cases titled “Sardarzada Zafar Abbas and 
Others Versus Syed Hassan Murtaza and Others” (PLD 
2005 Supreme Court 600) and “Muhammad Ibrahim 
Jatoi Versus Aftab Shaban Mirani and Others” (2016 
SCMR 722) and he contended that the view adopted in 
“Lt.-Col (Rtd.) Ghazanfar Abbas Shah Versus Mehr 
Khalid Mehmood Sargana and Others” (2015 SCMR 
1585) case has already been distinguished and when an 
affidavit of petitioner is attached, non-compliance of 
Order VI Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure-1908 
(the ‘Code’) in the petition losses significance; that the  
returned candidate is not sagacious, righteous, honest and 
ameen, thus, he was not qualified to contest the election. 
He relied upon the nomination papers as well as 
declaration dated 20.12.2023 and stated that the returned 
candidate has not disclosed his two properties each

measuring approximately 02-kanal and 01-marla given as 
gift to his sons namely M. Ammar Arshad Sahi and Attiq-
ur-Rehman Sahi. 
4.  
 
Heard. 
5.  
 
One of the objections of Sardar Abdul Majid 
Dogar, learned counsel for returned candidate, is that as 
per section 144(b) of the Act full particulars of illegal and 
corrupt practice are required to be given. He states that 
mainly the case is being pressed on the basis of mis-
declaration, however, the election-petitioner has not 
indicated in the entire election petition as to any benefit 
derived, 
from 
the 
purported 
mis-declaration, 
as 
necessitated in the case of “Khawaja Muhammad Asif v. 
Muhammad Usman Dar” (2018 SCMR 2128) and then 
reiterated in case titled “Shamona Badshah Qaisarani 
versus Election Tribunal, Multan and Others” (2021 
SCMR 988). Facing this objection Syed Muhammad 
Kaleem Ahmad Khurshid instead of giving any 
satisfactory answer has stated that tax record reflecting 
some benefit derived out of mis-declaration shall be given 
with the written arguments. The sons of the returned 
candidate somehow also filed their declaration and 
separate forms, which are available on the record. Their 
declarations reflect the gift from their father / the returned 
candidate.  
6.  
 
Now coming to the another objection of 
learned counsel for respondent No. 8 that no signature of 
the election-petitioner is available on the entire election 
petition including the verification. A perusal of the 
election petition reflects that neither the election petition 
itself is signed by the election-petitioner nor any signature 

 
E.P No. 18669 of 2024        
 
 
 
 
4 
of election-petitioner is available on the verification. 
Image of page No. 8 of this petition is as under:-  
 
 
  
 
The above reflects that this petition is only 
signed by the learned counsel for the election-petitioner. 
The date when the oath was taken is left blank and then 
the election-petitioner neglected to even sign this 
verification. Beneath the same, a stamp by Haji Khalid 
Mehmood, oath commissioner, is available which 
contains date of 20.03.2024 but the said oath 
commissioner has not declared that oath was administered 
before him. When confronted Syed Muhammad Kaleem 
Ahmad Khurshid states that this is accompanied by a full 
affidavit. There is no denial of the fact that if the 
verification in the election petition is not in accordance 
with law but the same is accompanied by an affidavit 
verifying the contents of the petition and it fulfills the 

 
E.P No. 18669 of 2024        
 
 
 
 
5 
requirements of the Act, there are some judgments which 
recognize that the election petition shall be taken as 
validly instituted. In case titled “Abdul Wahab Baloch 
Versus Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi and Others” (PLD 2019 
Lahore 119) after survey of the entire case law of the 
Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan, this Court 
reached to the conclusion that even a short affidavit is 
sufficient if it duly fulfills the requirement of Order VI 
Rule 15 of the Code. It is also settled that when the 
election-petitioner is not personally known to the oath 
commissioner, he can be identified by an advocate, who is 
then required to state that election-petitioner is personally 
known to him but the name of the learned Advocate 
identifying the deponent when not mentioned on the 
verification, the same is not valid.  
7.  
 
Perusal of verification on the affidavit relied 
by Syed Muhammad Kaleem Ahmad Khurshid reflects 
that the election-petitioner declared that he verified his 
affidavit on 19th March, 2024 without specifying which 
paragraphs he is verifying from his personal knowledge 
and which paragraphs are correct to his belief. There is a 
stamp of oath commissioner which reflects a different 
date of oath i.e. 20.03.2024. Not just the dates, one given 
by the election-petitioner and other by oath commissioner, 
are different but at the same time it is simply stated that 
the deponent is identified by some learned counsel. No 
name of the learned advocate is given. Relevant part of 
the affidavit is as under:- 

 
E.P No. 18669 of 2024        
 
 
 
 
6 
 
 
8.  
 
 As already discussed above, when the 
identification is to be made by an advocate, his name and 
particulars are required to be mentioned. In response to 
the same Syed Kaleem Ahmad Khurshid has relied upon 
“Sardarzada Zafar Abbas and Others”  and “Muhammad 
Ibrahim Jatoi” cases (supra). I am afraid that none of 
those judgments are applicable to the facts of the present 
case. It is observed by the Honourable Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the above referred cases that when the 
affidavit fulfills the requirement of Order VI Rule 15 of 
the Code then even the short affidavit is sufficient. 
However, in the present case, the deficiencies in the 
verification of the referred affidavit are amply clear.  
9.  
 
Now coming to another objection raised by 
Sardar Abdul Majid Dogar. In “Abdul Wahab Baloch”  
case (supra) it has been entrenched that section 144 of the 
Act requires appending an affidavit of service with the 
election petition to the effect that copies of the election 
petition along-with the copies of all annexures, including 
list of witnesses, affidavit(s) and documentary evidence 

 
E.P No. 18669 of 2024        
 
 
 
 
7 
have been sent to the respondents by registered or courier 
service. Even an ambiguous affidavit of service was found 
defective and invalid. In “Syed Atta Ul Hassan Versus 
Ahmad Nawaz and Others” (2019 MLD 1013) with 
respect to affidavit of service, it has been observed that 
postal receipts are not sufficient to meet the requirement 
of section 144(2)(c) of the Act. Paragraph No. 8 of the 
said judgment reads as under:- 
  
“8. I am similarly not convinced by 
the arguments of the learned counsel for the 
petitioner that in absence of the affidavit of 
service, the postal receipts are sufficient to 
serve the purposes of Section 144(2)(c), for 
the reason that under Section 145 of the Act 
if any of the provisions of Sections 142 to 
144 of the Act have not been complied with 
by a petitioner, the petition is not 
maintainable. The filing of the affidavit of 
service is one of the mandatory under 
Section 144(2)(c) of the Act. The petitioner 
has not filed the said affidavit, therefore, his 
petition is bad in law for that reason too.”  
 
10.  
 
Crux of above discussion is that this election 
petition is found deficient in many respects, therefore, the 
same is dismissed in terms of section 145(1) of the Act. 
No order as to cost.
