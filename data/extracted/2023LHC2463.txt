JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing 
27.04.2023. 
Petitioners by 
M/s Kashif Ali Chaudhry and Malik Asad 
Akram, Advocates for the petitioners. 
Respondents by: Mr. Omer Farooq Khan, Assistant Advocate 
General, Punjab alongwith Hafiz Muneeb 
Ahmad, Agricultural Officer (PP) O/o DG 
(Pest Warming) & QCP, Punjab Lahore. 
 
  
ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J.  This judgment will 
also decide Writ Petitions No.66540/2022, 69284/2022, 
76036/2022, 4203/2023 and 1580/2023, as identical questions 
of law and facts are raised in all these petitions.   
2. 
 
Relevant facts common in all these petitions are that 
through advertisement No.01/2021 dated 03.01.2021, 03 posts 
of Assistant Director of Agriculture (Plant Protection) 
(hereinafter referred as Assistant Director) in (BS-18) and 
02 posts of Deputy Director of Agriculture (Plant Protection) 
(hereinafter referred as Deputy Director) in (BS-18 + 165-
SP) were advertised by Agriculture Department through the 

 
 
W.P. No.64123/2022. 
                                                 2 
 
 
Punjab Public Service Commission, Lahore (PPSC). The 
petitioners in all these petitions applied for the said posts and 
also passed the written test, however, the petitioners’ 
interview call were cancelled on the ground that the 
petitioners do not have the required experience for the posts. 
The 
petitioners 
filed 
Writ 
Petitions 
No.64123/2022, 
66540/2022, 69284/2022 and 76036/2022 in which as an 
interim relief, the petitioners were provisionally allowed to 
appear for interview subject to final outcome of these writ 
petitions. However, in the meanwhile, vide letter dated 
12.12.2022, the Agricultural Department, requested the PPSC 
to withdraw the requisition of the aforesaid posts for the 
reasons mentioned in the said letter. Some of the petitioners 
being 
aggrieved 
have 
filed 
separate 
Writ 
Petition 
No.1580/2023 and 4203/2023, challenging the letter dated 
12.12.2022 for withdrawal of requisition of the posts of 
Assistant Directors and Deputy Directors.  
3. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that 
petitioners have required experience for the posts in question, 
therefore, their interview call could not be cancelled. Further 
submits that requisition could not be withdrawn by the 
department on 12.12.2022 without approval of Addl. Chief 
Secretary, Services & General Administration Department 
(S&GAD). Further submits that once the petitioners were 

 
 
W.P. No.64123/2022. 
                                                 3 
 
 
called for interviews after passing the written test, the vested 
right accrued in favour of the petitioners and the requisition 
could not be withdrawn. Finally submits that the grounds of 
withdrawal of requisition are not valid as the post of 
“Agricultural Officer” was also upgraded under the Rules but 
same was not withdrawn rather appointments were made 
against the said post.  
4. 
 
Learned Law Officer, on the other hand, submits that 
as requisition for the posts in question have been withdrawn 
by the competent Authority, therefore, these constitutional 
petitions have become infructuous and the petitioners should 
apply again when the posts will be re-advertised. He, 
however, explained that post of Agriculture Officer was not 
withdrawn because no upgradation took place in respect of 
post of Agricultural Officer, which was BS-17 post and was 
properly advertised. He also submits that as required by PPSC, 
the approval of the Addl. Chief Secretary has been obtained in 
terms of relevant regulation. 
5. 
 
Arguments heard. The record shows that the posts of 
Assistant Director and Deputy Director were advertised on 
03.01.2021 by Agriculture Department, through PPSC, 
however, the requisition of said posts were withdrawn by the 
concerned department. The first moot question require 
determination in these cases is that whether the requisition of 

 
 
W.P. No.64123/2022. 
                                                 4 
 
 
said posts was lawfully withdrawn and secondly whether any 
vested right accrued in favour of the petitioners against the 
withdrawal of said requisition. To determine the aforesaid 
legal issues, it is necessary to reproduce regulation 12 (a) of 
the Punjab Public Service Commission Regulations, 2022 
(Regulations) as under:- 
12. 
a.  
If 
the 
department 
decides 
to 
increase/decrease the number of vacancies or to 
withdraw altogether the requisitioned vacancies 
for valid reasons, approval of Additional Chief 
Secretary (S&GAD) shall be required, but this 
shall be done before sending of recommendation(s) 
by the Commission to the Department.  
6. 
 
Plain reading of aforesaid Regulation shows that 
department can withdraw the requisitioned vacancies 
altogether for valid reasons, however, approval of Additional 
Chief Secretary (S&GAD) shall be required and said 
withdrawal must be before sending recommendations by the 
PPSC to the concerned department. In the present case, 
admittedly the recommendations were not yet sent by the 
PPSC to the Agriculture Department and on instruction of 
PPSC, the approval of Additional Chief Secretary (S&GAD) 
was also obtained on 31.03.2023 as per requirement of 
Regulations 12 (a) ibid. So far as the reasons for withdrawal 
of requisition are concerned, the working paper placed on 
record by the respondents shows that post of Assistant 
Director and Deputy Director have been omitted from the 

 
 
W.P. No.64123/2022. 
                                                 5 
 
 
Rules and revised nomenclature and pay scale of the said 
posts have been mentioned but same was not incorporated in 
the advertisement. The learned Law Officer on instructions 
also explained that post of Assistant Director was advertised 
in BS-18, whereas under the prevailing Rules the same is of 
BS-17 post, whereas against the posts of Deputy Director, 
special pay 165 was mentioned which is actually not available 
under the current Rules. The above reasons recorded by the 
department to withdraw the requisition appear to be valid 
reasons and does not shown to be suffered from any illegality 
or mala-fide.  
7. 
 
The plea of the petitioners that Basic pay scale of 
Agricultural Officer was also changed from BS-17 to BS-18 
but its requisition was not withdrawn, is not supported by any 
relevant Rules. The notification dated 06.04.2021 (presented 
by petitioner’s learned counsel) to upgrade the post of 
Agricultural Officer, was merely a recommendation, however, 
admittedly under the Rules, post of Agricultural Officer was 
never upgraded from BS-17 to BS-18. Further, the notification 
of appointment dated 04.04.2023 shows that appointments 
were made against the post of Agricultural Officer in BS-17 as 
per advertisement and not in BS-18 as claimed by the 
petitioners. The above discussion would lead to ineluctable 
conclusion that respondent-department not only had the 

 
 
W.P. No.64123/2022. 
                                                 6 
 
 
authority to withdraw the requisition but same has been done 
validly as per requirement of Regulations 12 (a) of the 
Regulations.  
8. 
 
Regarding the vested right in favour of the 
petitioners, suffice it to note that though the petitioners have 
applied for the post of Assistant Director & Deputy Director 
and also appeared in the written test and interview but 
thereafter, neither they have been recommended for the post 
nor any merit list was issued or any appointment letter was 
issued in favour of the petitioners. In absence of any of the 
aforesaid incidents, no vested right accrued in favour of the 
petitioners. This legal position also coincide with the 
Regulation 12 (a) of the Regulation under which the 
department could withdraw the requisition altogether for valid 
reasons before any recommendations made by the PPSC.  
9. 
 
In similar situation, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan and various High Courts expressed the same view in 
the following case law.  
i.   
In 
“SECRETARY 
FINANCE 
and 
others 
Vs. 
GHULAM SAFDAR” (2005 SCMR 534), the Hon’ble Apex 
Court held as under:- 
“Be that as it may, it is difficult to sustain the 
prayer of the respondents since mere selection in 
written examination and interview test would not, 

 
 
W.P. No.64123/2022. 
                                                 7 
 
 
by itself, vest candidates with a Fundamental 
Rights for enforcement as such in the exercise of 
Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court. 
Admittedly, the appellants had not issued any 
offer of appointment to the respondents and their 
appointment was subject to clearance by the 
Establishment Division under the Centralized 
System of Recruitment till it was discontinued in 
November, 1996, which again coincided with the 
imposition of ban on fresh recruitments, which 
could not be safely ignored by the appellants. 
Thus, the High Court was not right in 
overlooking this aspect of the case and issuing a 
writ of mandamus of the nature prayed for.”  
ii.  
The same view was also expressed by the Division 
Bench of this Court (while relying on different case law) in 
“SAIFULLAH Vs. INSPECTOR GENERAL, PUNJAB 
POLICE, LAHORE and 21 others” (2019 PLC (C.S) 1345) 
as under:- 
“It is pertinent to mention here that right to 
employ an employee vests with the employer only 
who in its discretion can scrap the recruitment 
process before its finalization and employee 
cannot claim that the employer be directed to 
complete the recruitment process as his vested 
right. Reliance in this regard is placed on the 
judgment reported as Dr. Mubashar Ahmad V. 
P.T.C.L. through its Chairman, Islamabad and 
another (2004 SCMR 1673). Mere qualifying in 
written examination and interview does not vest a 
candidate 
with 
a 
fundamental 
right 
for 
appointment 
enforceable 
in 
exercise 
of 
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court unless the 
competent authority has approved such selection. 
Reference may be made to the judgment reported 
as Secretary Finance and others v. Ghulam 
Safdar 2005 SCMR 534). Same principle has 
been reiterated in Riaz Gul and 5 others v. 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, 
Ministry of Water and Power, Government of 
Pakistan, Islamabad and 36 others (2016 PLC 
(C.S) 350).”  

 
 
W.P. No.64123/2022. 
                                                 8 
 
 
iii.  
The 
learned 
Peshawar 
High 
Court 
in 
“HAYATULLAH KHAN Vs. GOVERNMENT OF KYBER 
PAKTHUNKNAW through Chief Secretary and 4 others” 
(2017 PLC (C.S) Note 53) held that the petitioner has no 
locus-standi to call in question the enhancement of 
qualification and standard for recruitment in the amended 
advertisement. Relevant observations are reproduced as 
under:- 
“Sensing the situation, probably the competent 
authority 
issued 
amended 
advertisement, 
requiring therein by way of enhancing the 
experience to that of Supreme Court which seems 
to be legal, justified and appropriate. It is an 
admitted fact that earlier short listing was made 
and petitioner was called for interview but no 
result 
was 
declared, 
nor 
petitioner 
recommended, hence, no right, whatsoever, could 
be claimed.”  
iv.  
The learned Sindh High Court in “RIAZ GUL and 
others 
Vs. 
FEDERATION 
OF 
PAKISTAN through 
Secretary, Ministry of Water and Power, Government of 
Pakistan, Islamabad and others” (2016 PLC (C.S) 350) 
held as under:- 
“It will be relevant to mention that mere 
selection in written examination and interview 
test would not, by itself, vest candidates with any 
fundamental right for enforcement as such. Even 
otherwise, it is established legal position that 
factual controversies, which are very much 
involved in the present petition as per allegations 
and counter allegations between the parties, 
cannot be decided by invoking the jurisdiction of 
this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution.”  

 
 
W.P. No.64123/2022. 
                                                 9 
 
 
v.  
Similarly, the learned Sindh High Court in “SAJID 
RAZA and 17 others Vs. EXECUTIVE DISTRICT OFFICER 
(EDUCATION AND LITERACY), NOUSHERO FEROZ and 
3 other” (2015 PLC (C.S) 108) held that the offer letters, 
unless followed by acceptance and final appointment letters, 
does not in our view confer any vested right upon the 
petitioners.  
vi.  
Same view was also expressed in “ASADULLAH 
MANGI and others Vs. PAKISTAN INTERNATIONAL 
AIRLINES CORPORATION and others” (2005 PLC (C.S) 
771) and “ZAKA ULLAH BAJWA Vs. GOVERNMENT OF 
THE PUNJAB through Secretary, Public Prosecution 
Department, Lahore” (2013 PLC (C.S) 344) 
10.  
Though the petitioners in these petitions are claiming 
that they have the required experience for the posts in 
question, therefore, their interview could not be cancelled, 
however, as the requisition has already been withdrawn for the 
posts in question, therefore, this issue needs no adjudication in 
these proceedings at this stage.  
11.  
In view of above discussion, writ petitions 
No.64123/2022, 66540/2022, 69284/2022 & 76036/2022 have 
become infructuous, whereas Writ Petitions No.4203/2023 & 

 
 
W.P. No.64123/2022. 
                                                 10 
 
 
1580/2023 have no merits. For the reasons, recorded above, 
all these petitions are dismissed.
