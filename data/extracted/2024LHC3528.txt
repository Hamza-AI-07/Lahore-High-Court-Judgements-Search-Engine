 SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:- The 
captioned intra court appeal, under section 3 of the Law 
Reforms Ordinance-1972 as well as the appeals as detailed in 
schedule 'A' to this judgment, have been filed against 
judgment dated 22.12.2022 passed by the learned Judge-in-
Chamber. Upon hearing the appeals the learned Judges of the 
Division Bench reached to different conclusions on certain 
issues. As a result thereof, the cases have been referred with 
the following:- 
 
Terms of reference:- 
• 
Can power under Order XLI, Rule 33 CPC be 
exercised without notice to the parties and 
without opportunity of hearing and whether the 
judgment of the learned Single Judge could be 
upset by exercise of these powers? 
• 
Can the power under O.XLI, R. 33 CPC be 
exercised unilaterally by one member of a 
Division Bench hearing the appeal. 
• 
 If the answer to the above is in the affirmative, 
can the constitutionality of S.8(2)(b) of the 
2022 Act be upheld by invoking Art. 141 of the 
Constitution in ignorance of entry 50 of the 
Fourth Schedule to the Constitution. 
• 
Has the levy under S.8(2)(b) been imposed on 

 
ICA No. 13108 of 2023              (Judgment) 
 
 
5 
a resident individual or a foreign asset. 
 
2.   
 
The first two terms of reference relate to power 
of Court of Appeal under Order XLI, Rule 33 of the Code 
of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the 'Code'). The relevant portion 
of the rule, which was introduced in the Code by 
Amendment Act IX of 19221, reads:- 
 
  
“33. Power of Court of Appeal.--The 
appellate Court shall have power to pass any 
decree and make any order which ought to 
have been passed or made and to pass or make 
such further or other decree or order as the 
case may be require, and this power may be 
exercised by the Court notwithstanding that 
the appeal is as to part only of the decree and 
may be exercised in favour of all or any of the 
respondents 
or 
parties, 
although 
such 
respondents or parties may not have filed any 
appeal or objection." 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied)  
 
3.  
 
Prior to above amendment, under Rule 22 of 
Order XLI of the Code, it was incumbent for the non-
appealing party to file cross-objection in manners 
prescribed therein. The above reproduced rule permits the 
Court of Appeal to make an order which ought to have been 
passed by the Court of first instance but not passed and to 
make such further order as the case may require. The words 
used “the appeal is as to part only of the decree and may be 
exercised in favour of all or any of the respondents or 
parties, although such respondents or parties may not have 
filed any appeal or objection" start with "notwithstanding". 
 
1 Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1922 

 
ICA No. 13108 of 2023              (Judgment) 
 
 
6 
The legislature has also used affirmative wording enabling 
the Courts of Appeal to pass order that should have been 
passed and also vitalized it by using non-obstante clause. 
4.  
 
The language used is indicative of the intention 
of legislature to confer extensive power upon Court of 
Appeal to make order as the case may require, irrespective 
of filing appeal by a respondent or cross objection. Reading 
of Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code itself is convincing 
enough as to wide powers of Court of Appeal permitting to 
make orders that may be necessary for doing complete 
justice in a particular case. The Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in “Messrs S. M. Yusuf & Bros Versus (1) Mirza 
Muhammad Mehdi Pooya, and (2) Amanullah Kirmani” 2 
has already ruled:- 
  
"We have accordingly referred to earlier 
judgment of the same Court in the earlier case 
of Bakhsh Illahi & Sons to examine the 
arguments there set out. Four precedent 
judgments are cited. From three of them, which 
are mentioned without reference to their 
particular facts, general propositions are 
extracted to the effect that the power given by 
the rule is widely expressed and must be 
applied with discretion, where interference is 
required "to adjust the right of the parties in 
accordance with justice, equity and good 
conscience" or where the failure to exercise 
the 
power 
"would 
lead 
to 
impossible, 
contradictory and unworkable orders". These 
particular considerations un-doubtedly are 
circumstances which would justify the exercise 
of the discretion conferred by the rule, but it is 
right that we should say that if these 
propositions are to be understood as limiting 
 
2 PLD 1965 Supreme Court 15 

 
ICA No. 13108 of 2023              (Judgment) 
 
 
7 
the exercise of the power within the 
circumstances specified, they would be in 
excess of the power given to the Courts to 
interpret and apply a rule express in such 
wide terms as is rule 33. The rule confers 
unfettered discretion, and anything expressed 
in negative or restrictive terms, affecting its 
application, must be accepted as applying only 
to the particular facts of the case to which the 
rule is being applied by interpretation. Such 
an interpretation cannot be extended to all or 
any other cases, for, in each one, the 
application of the rule must be made 
beneficially, and in accordance with the 
relevant facts.” 
       (Emphasis supplied) 
5.   
 
In “Ranjana Prakash and Ors Versus The 
Divisional Manager And Anr” 3 it is observed that Order 
XLI Rule 33 of the Code can also be pressed into service to 
make an award more effective or maintain an award on 
grounds other than invoked by a learned Court in the order 
under appeal. Paragraph No. 7 of the said judgment reads as 
under:- 
“7. This principle also flows from Order 
41 Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
which enables an appellate court to pass any 
order which ought to have been passed by the 
trial court and to make such further or other 
order as the case may require, even if the 
respondent had not filed any appeal or cross-
objections. This power is entrusted to the 
appellate court to enable it to do complete 
justice between the parties. Order 41 Rule 33 
of the Code can however be pressed into 
service to make the award more effective or 
maintain the award on other grounds or to 
make the other parties to litigation to share the

benefits or the liability, but cannot be invoked 
to get a larger or higher relief. For example, 
where the claimants seeks compensation 
against the owner and the insurer of the 
vehicle and the Tribunal makes the award only 
against the owner, on an appeal by the owner 
challenging the quantum, the appellate court 
can make the insurer jointly and severally 
liable to pay the compensation, along with the 
owner, even though the claimants had not 
challenged the non-grant of relief against the 
Insurer" 
(Underlining is added) 
6.   
 
In “Mst. Bibi Fatima Versus Muhammad 
Sarwar”4, while discussing powers of Court of Appeal to 
grant relief to non-appealing parties, the Honourable 
Supreme Court has held that the appellate court is 
empowered, in the interest of justice, to allow appropriate 
relief to non-appealing parties where the appeal is with 
regard to whole of the decree in terms of Order XLI, Rule 
33, CPC. The Court has also inherent powers under section 
151, CPC, to make such orders, as may be necessary for the 
ends of justice and to prevent the abuse of the process of the 
Court. These are all enabling provisions; the powers 
thereunder can be exercised by the Court to cover 
ostensibly impossible situations, for complete dispensation 
of justice, for which C.P.C. has been designed, but despite 
the best efforts of the draftsman, to cater for all possible 
situations, if it is found lacking in meeting some 
eventualities, the Court can act ex delicto justiciae, supply 
the omission in the procedure, adopt methodology, for 
effectually carrying out the purpose.

7. 
 
Now I would like to engage in remaining 
aspects of the first two terms of reference regarding notice 
to the parties or opportunity of hearing before utilizing 
powers under Order XLI, Rule 33 of the Code as well as 
unilateral exercise of power under the said rule. Report and 
para-wise comments filed by respondent No. 2 / Federal 
Board of Revenue, before the learned Judge-in-Chamber, 
more specifically paragraphs No. (ii), (iii) and (vi), reflect 
that the said respondent has raised plea as to the deficiency 
of powers of the Provinces to make laws having extra-
territorial operation as well as prayed to uphold 
constitutionality of section 8(2)(b) of the Finance Act, 2022 
(the 'Act of 2022') on the basis of powers confers upon the 
Parliament under Article 141 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the ‘Constitution’). 
Careful reading of the report and para-wise comments, 
indeed, reveals that this remained the main focus of the said 
respondents before the learned Judge-in-Chamber.  
8. 
 
The above submissions made by the learned 
counsel for the respondents are also captured by the learned 
Judge-in-Chamber as reflected from paragraph No. 8 of the 
judgment questioned before the learned Division Bench. 
The arguments to this effect are also addressed in the 
operative part of the judgment. The entire material, 
including the discussed part of the report and para-wise 
comments, was before the Honourable Division Bench. 
Paragraph No. 7 in one of the judgments, given by one of 
my learned brothers (Anwaar Hussain, J), confirms that the 
question as to not filing cross-objections or challenging the 

 
ICA No. 13108 of 2023              (Judgment) 
 
 
10 
judgment passed by the learned Judge-in-chamber was 
raised, considered and then dealt with. It cannot be said that 
the appellants were not having notice as to the ground set-
up in defense to the petitions or the appellants were not 
afforded hearing vis-à-vis the points that remained under 
discussion, which clearly include Article 141 of the 
Constitution and its potential effect on the relevant 
provisions of the Act of 2022.   
9. 
 
It is already discussed in material detail that 
Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code, notable falling under the 
sub-topic 
/ 
heading 
of 
the 
“Judgment-in-Appeal”, 
effectively empowers the Court of Appeal with wide 
powers to make orders which ought to have been passed or 
make such further order as the case may require for doing 
complete justice, notwithstanding that appeal is directed 
against a part of decree, in favour of all or any of the parties 
and even if such parties or respondents have not filed appeal 
or cross-objection. The power, bestowed upon Courts of 
Appeal, so strongly worded and using non-obstante clause 
prior to "….although such respondents or parties may not 
have filed any appeal or objection", cannot be visualized so 
narrowly; and when the defense set-up by the respondents 
as well as their arguments on the particular issue are duly 
documented by the learned Judges, no question to exercise 
of any unilateral power by one member of worthy Division 
Bench arises, either. Even, the learned counsel for the 
parties, while assisting this Court, have not shown 
disagreement as to this precise proposition.

10. 
 
Now it is proper to examine sub-sections (1), 
(2)(b), (4)(g) and (13)(c) and (f) of section 8 of the Act of 
2022, which read as under:-   
8. Capital value tax 2022. –  
 
1.  
A tax shall be levied, charged, collected 
and paid on the value of assets at the 
rates specified in the First Schedule to 
this section for tax year 2022 and 
onwards; 
Provided that the tax shall be charged 
from the 1st day of July, 2022 in case of 
motor vehicles held in Pakistan. 
2.   
Capital Value Tax shall be charged on 
the following assets- 
(b) 
foreign 
assets 
of 
a 
resident 
individual where the value of such 
assets on the last day of the tax year in 
aggregate exceeds Rupees one hundred 
million; and  
4. 
The Tax shall be collected or paid in 
following manner, namely:-  
(g) in case of assets mentioned in 
clauses (b) of sub-section (2), the person 
holding the assets shall be liable to pay 
tax at the time the income tax return for 
the tax year is due in the manner 
prescribed; and 
13.      In this section- 
(c) “foreign assets” means any 
movable or immovable assets held 
outside Pakistan, whether directly or 
indirectly, and includes but not 
limited to real estate, mortgaged 
assets, 
stock 
and 
shares, 
bank 
accounts, 
bullion, 
cash, 
jewels, 
jewelry, paintings, accounts and loan 
receivables, 
assets 
held 
in 

 
ICA No. 13108 of 2023              (Judgment) 
 
 
12 
dependents’ 
name, 
beneficial 
ownership or beneficial interests or 
contribution in offshore entities or 
trusts;  … 
(f)  “resident individual” shall have 
the same meanings as defined in the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (XLIX of 
2001); 
 (Emphasis is added) 
  
 
Even 
plain 
reading 
of 
the 
reproduced 
provisions of the Act of 2022 makes it profusely clear that 
the legislature has envisaged this tax to be paid by resident 
individual(s) on the foreign assets, which are defined in 
sub-section  13(c), when such assets have aggregate value 
exceeding rupees one hundred million. Sub-section 13(f) 
of the Act of 2022 provides that resident individual shall 
have same meaning as given in Income Tax Ordinance, 
2001. Now, approaching the constitutionality of section 
8(2)(b) the Act of 2022 and the question if it can be upheld 
by invoking Article 141 of the Constitution. It is apt to 
reproduce articles 141 and 142 of the Constitution, which 
read as under:- 
"141. Subject to the Constitution, Majlis-
e- Shoora (Parliament) may make laws 
including laws having extra-territorial 
operation for the whole or any part of 
Pakistan, and a Provincial Assembly 
may make laws for the Province or any 
part thereof. 
 
142. Subject to the Constitution--- 
 
(a)  
[Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament)] shall 
have exclusive power to make laws with 
respect to any matter in the Federal 

 
ICA No. 13108 of 2023              (Judgment) 
 
 
13 
Legislative List; 
(b) 
Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) and a 
Provincial Assembly shall have power to 
make laws with respect to criminal law, 
criminal law, criminal procedure and 
evidence;] 
(c)  
subject to paragraph (b), a Provincial 
Assembly shall, and Majlis-e-Shoora 
(Parliament) shall not, have power to 
make laws with respect to any matter not 
enumerated in the Federal Legislative 
List;] 
(d)  
Majlis-e-Shoora 
(Parliament) 
shall 
have exclusive power to make laws with 
respect to all matters pertaining to such 
areas in the Federation as are not 
included in any Province. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
11. 
  
It is already a settled field by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan that when body / provisions of the 
Constitution identify any particular power to legislate, as if 
it vests with the Parliament or Provincial Assemblies, then 
reference to legislative entries in the fourth schedule to the 
Constitution is hardly of any consequence. In case titled 
“Province of Sindh through Chief Secretary and Others 
Versus M.Q.M. through Deputy Convener and Others”5 the 
Court repelled contentions made at the bar that Parliament 
can make laws only as mandated under the Federal 
Legislative List given in the fourth schedule to the 
Constitution, in view of the fact that those powers, on the 
relevant area in the said case,  are given in the body of the 
Constitution. It is ruled that Constitutional intent has to be 
gathered from the body of the Constitution as well and not 
 
5 PLD 2014 SC 531 

 
ICA No. 13108 of 2023              (Judgment) 
 
 
14 
merely the Legislative List. Paragraph No. 62 of the said 
judgment reads as follows:- 
  
"62. Since Article 222(b) does not 
exclude the delimitation of constituencies for 
local government, and as the body of the 
Constitution 
specifies 
the 
appropriate 
legislature which should pass the law, any 
reference to the provisions of the legislative 
entries contained in Item 4 of the Fourth 
Schedule are of no consequence. There are 
similar provisions in the Constitution qua 
which there is no corresponding entry in the 
Federal Legislative List. For example, Article 
6 clearly provides that the Majlis-e-Shoora 
(Parliament) will pass the law for high 
treason. But there is no corresponding entry in 
the 4th Schedule prescribing the subject of high 
treason in the Federal Legislative List. Article 
142(c) could not be pressed into service to say 
that since the 4 Schedule is silent, in terms of 
Article 142(c), the Provincial Legislature 
would legislate in respect of high treason. 
When the main body of the Constitution 
provides for the competent legislature it is not 
necessary to look into the legislative list. 
Under Article 87(2), the Majlis-e-Shoora 
(Parliament) may enact law for condition of 
service of secretarial staff, whereas in this 
regard there is no corresponding entry in the 
Federal Legislative List; that Article 237 
empowers the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) to 
make laws for indemnity; against there is no 
entry to that effect in the Federal Legislative 
List; that under Article 253 the Majlis-e- 
Shoora Parliament) may make laws pertaining 
to maximum limits as to property etc; however, 
there is no corresponding entry in the Federal 
Legislative List; Article 146(2) states that the 
Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) may enact laws 
to confer powers of Provinces or their officers, 
but there is no entry in this regard in the 
Federal Legislative List; that under proviso to 

 
ICA No. 13108 of 2023              (Judgment) 
 
 
15 
clause (2) of Article 212, the Majlis-e-Shoora 
(Parliament) may make laws in relation to 
administrative tribunals, however, there is no 
corresponding entry in the Federal Legislative 
List; that even though electricity" falls under 
entry 4 of the Part II of the Federal Legislative 
List, under Article 157(2)(b) the Provincial 
Government is empowered to levy tax on 
consumption of electricity within the Province 
and that Entry 58 of the Part 1 of the Federal 
Legislative List, clearly provides that the 
matters which under the Constitution are 
within the legislative competence of Majlis-e-
Shoora 
(Parliament) 
or 
relate 
to 
the 
Federation, would fall under the domain of the 
Federal Legislature. In the instant case, as 
explained above, under the relevant Articles of 
the Constitution, the subject matters of 
delimitation and conduct of Local Government 
Elections fall under the domain of Parliament / 
Federal Legislature”  
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
12.  
 
In “Messrs Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd. 
and Others Versus Federation of Pakistan and Others”6 it 
was observed that from the provisions of the Constitution it 
is clear that the Federal Legislature has extra-territorial 
authority to legislate but no such extra-territorial authority 
is assigned to the Provincial Legislature. In this case the 
Honourable Supreme Court relied on Article 141 of the 
Constitution and reached to the conclusion that Provincial 
Legislature has no legislative competence to legislate law 
regulating the trade unions functioning at trans-provincial 
level. Reproducing a relevant extract from the said 
judgment will be beneficial:- 
 
6 2018 SCMR 802 

 
ICA No. 13108 of 2023              (Judgment) 
 
 
16 
".... This interpretation also finds 
support from the fact that in terms of Article 
141 
of 
the 
Constitution, 
a 
Provincial 
Legislature does not possess extra- territorial 
legislative competence and therefore, cannot 
legislate with regard to a subject which in its 
application has to transcend the provincial 
boundaries. It is to be noted that as clarified by 
the learned High Court the resort to Entry No. 
58 ibid could only be made to deal with an 
extra-ordinary situation i.e. when a matter may 
fall within the legislative competence of the 
Province but when it comes to its application it 
has to travel beyond the territorial boundaries 
of the Province, bringing it into the domain of 
the Federal Legislation. Thus, it is held that 
the federal legislature has the competence to 
legislate relating to the Establishments/Trade 
Unions functioning at the Federal as well as 
trans-provincial level.”  
(Underlining is added) 
13.  
 
The above judgments were later on relied by 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled “Government 
of Sindh through Secretary Health Department and Others 
Versus Dr. Nadeem Rizvi and Others”7 and it has been 
observed that it is not necessary to look into legislative list 
when the main body of the Constitution provides the 
requisite powers. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
recently reiterated the same in case titled “Muslim 
Commercial Bank Limited Versus Muhammad Anwar 
Mandokhel and Others”8, whereby, while referring to 
Article 141 of the Constitution, following has been 
observed:- 
 
7 2020 SCMR 1 
8 2024 SCMR 298 
 

 
ICA No. 13108 of 2023              (Judgment) 
 
 
17 
  
 
“….From the above provision of 
the Constitution, it is abundantly clear that the 
Parliament has extra-territorial authority to 
legislate, but the Provincial Legislature has no 
legislative competence to legislate a law 
regulating the establishments and industries 
functioning at the trans-provincial level. 
Keeping in mind the afore-noted legal position, 
we have carefully examined the BIRO 2010 
and the BIRA 2010 and have found that they do 
invest the Provincial Labour Court with the 
authority to adjudicate upon the matters 
relating to the trans-provincial establishments 
even if they provide so, it could not sustain 
under the law…..”  
                                                       (Underlining is added)  
14. 
 
The categories or fields falling in the Federal 
Legislative List, in terms of Article 142(a) of the 
Constitution, are within the exclusive domain of Parliament. 
The Provincial Assemblies have power to make laws with 
respect to any matter not enumerated in the Federal 
Legislative List. Then Article 142(d) of the Constitution 
again gives exclusive powers to Parliament with respect to 
all matters pertaining to such areas in the Federation as are 
not included in territorial limits of any of the Province. 
Meaning thereby, the Parliament has power to make laws 
given in Federal Legislative List as well as the matters 
pertaining to such areas which are not included in any 
Province. Article 141 of the Constitution embodies that 
Parliament has power to make laws having extra-territorial 
operation for whole or any part of Pakistan and the 
Provinces can make laws within their territorial limits.

The above leaves no ambiguity with regard to

intent of the Constitution makers that when it is not within 
the competence of any of the Province to impose tax in 
connection with a subject-matter, on account of its 
restriction of territorial limits, then the Parliament has 
competence in this regard. The Provincial Legislature can 
tax immovable property which is located within its 
territories. Suitable laws exist or have been made by the 
relevant Provincial Legislative authorities in this regard. 
However, the tax in question is to be paid by resident 
individual(s) on their foreign assets, as already defined in 
sub-section 13(c) of the Act of 2022, when such assets have 
aggregate value exceeding rupees one hundred million. 
Undisputedly, section 8(2)(b) of the Act of 2022 refers to 
assets, which do fall within the territorial limits of the 
Provinces. It seems that the appellants are attempting to 
seek complete escape from the tax, by adopting incorrect 
approach towards Articles 141 and 142 of the Constitution 
and also by misinterpreting entry 50 as to competence of the 
Parliament to legislate. The interpretation put-forth by the 
appellants, even otherwise, infringes the settled principle in 
“M/s Ellahi Cotton Mills LTD and Others Versus 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary M/o Finance, 
Islamabad and 06 Others”9 that the Courts must lean in 
favour of upholding the constitutionality of a legislation 
keeping in view that the rule of Constitutional interpretation 
is that there is a presumption in favour of the 
constitutionality of legislative enactment unless ex-facie it is 
violative of Constitutional Provision.
