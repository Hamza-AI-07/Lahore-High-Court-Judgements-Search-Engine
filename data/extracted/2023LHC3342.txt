2. 
The prosecution story as given in paragraph No.2 of the judgment 
of learned trial court reads as under:- 
“2. The prosecution case as gleaned from the complaint 
Exh.PB lodged by Rana Javed Iqbal Deputy District Officer 
Water Management Bahawalpur is that Mr. Maqbool 
Ahmad water Management officer/incharge Field Team 
No.1 Bahawalpur of National Program for Improvement of 
Water Courses, informed the complainant through letter No. 
149 cated 24.03.2008 that Muhammad Tasleem water 
management supervisor Bahawalpur fraudulently and by 
misusing his official position, obtained five blank cheques 
from the presidents and treasurers of Khall committee of 
Moga No. 119415-R and Moga No. 126024-R and had an 
amount of Rs. 13,25,000/- meant for the improvement of 
said water courses and misappropriated the said amount.” 
3. 
After registration of the crime report, investigation of the case was 
entrusted to Basharat Ali S.I. (PW.7) and thereafter to Farhat Hussain 
Farooq Assistant Director, Anti-Corruption Establishment, Bahawalpur 
(PW.6) and on completion of investigation, report under section 173, 
Cr.P.C. was submitted before the learned trial court against the appellant 
and his co-accused Muhammad Bilal, but co-accused Muhammad Bilal 
became fugitive from law and was declared as proclaimed offender by 
the learned trial court.  
4. 
After observing all pre-trial codal formalities, charge under 
sections 409, 420, 468, 471 PPC read with section 5(2) of Prevention of 
Corruption Act, 1947, was framed against the appellant on 01.11.2011, 
to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.  
5. 
In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced as many as 
seven witnesses. Muhammad Kashif Abdullah (PW.1) received 
application for registration of case along with the order dated 03-02-2010 
of Director Anti-Corruption Establishment, Bahawalpur and recorded the 
F.I.R (Exh.PA).  Rana Javed, DDO (WM) Bahawalpur (PW.2) was the 
complainant of the case. Farrukh Rasheed (PW.3) was the witness of 

Crl. Appeal No.544 of 2015 
3
recovery memos. Hazoor Bakhsh (PW.4) was the president of 
watercourse committee of outlets (موگا) No.126024-R Mouza Agha Pur.  
Haji Nazeer Ahmad (PW.5) was the cashier of watercourse committee of 
outlets (موگا) No.126024-R Mouza Agha Pur. Farhat Hussain Farooq 
(PW.6) being Investigating Officer stated about the various steps taken 
by him during investigation of the case. Basharat Ali S.I. (PW.7) was the 
scriber of F.I.R No. 119 dated 27-03-2008, under sections 420,468, 471 
P.P.C., Police Station Bagdad ul Jadeed (Exh.PA). He (PW.7) also 
partially investigated the case.  
On completion of prosecution evidence, the appellant was 
examined under section 342 Cr.P.C. whereby he once again denied the 
allegations leveled against him and professed his innocence. While 
answering to a question, “why the case against you and why the PWs 
have deposed against you? the appellant stated as under:- 
“I have been falsely involved in this case and the witnesses being 
the officials of water management Department have falsely 
deposed against me just to let off the actual culprits.”  
 
The appellant neither opted to make statement on oath as provided 
under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in disproof of 
the allegations leveled by the prosecution against him.  
6. 
The learned trial court, on conclusion of trial, vide judgment dated 
01.12.2015, convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above.  
7. 
Learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the appellant was 
falsely entangled in this case just to save the skin of actual culprits. 
Further argued that though the appellant could not cross-examine the 
prosecution witnesses, because his right of cross-examination was struck 
off by the learned trial court, but mere this fact does not mean that 
whatever they had spoken before the learned trial court would be 
considered as gospel truth. Adds that even uncross-examined statements 
of prosecution witnesses are highly discrepant and as such the conviction 
and sentences of appellant cannot be maintained on the basis thereof. 
Lastly, learned counsel for the appellant contended that the prosecution 
has miserably failed to prove the case against the appellant, thus, has 

Crl. Appeal No.544 of 2015 
4
prayed that the appellant may be acquitted of the charges levelled against 
him by accepting the instant appeal. 
8. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer assisted by learned counsel for 
the complainant argued that the prosecution has successfully proved its 
case against the appellant beyond any shadow of doubt through 
convincing, unimpeachable and overwhelming evidence. Learned 
counsel for the complainant added that since the appellant had opted not 
to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses, so it amounts to admission 
on the part of appellant that whatever the PWs had stated, was true in all 
aspects. Finally, both have prayed for dismissal of appeal.  
9. 
I have anxiously considered the arguments put forth by learned 
counsel for the appellant as well as learned Law Officer assisted by 
learned counsel for the complainant and scanned the record minutely. 
10. 
Moot-point raised by learned Law Officer assisted by learned 
counsel for the complainant is that not a single prosecution witness has 
been cross-examined by the defence despite the fact that the appellant 
was given more than sufficient opportunities and ultimately his right of 
cross-examination was closed by the learned trial court with cogent 
reasons. In this regard, learned Law Officer has referred to paragraph 
No.6 of the impugned judgment, wherein it is stated that the learned trial 
court, vide order dated 16.01.2013, closed the appellant's right to cross-
examine the prosecution witnesses and subsequently, his application to 
summon them for cross-examination was also dismissed by the learned 
trial court vide order dated 19.06.2013, however, this Court restored the 
appellant's such right vide order dated 07.11.2013 passed in Criminal 
Revision No.145 of 2013, whereby the appellant was given two 
opportunities to conduct cross-examination, but each time he failed to do 
so, upon which the learned trial court again closed his right of cross-
examination vide order dated 18.03.2014. This Court vide judgment 
dated 07.05.2014 passed in Criminal Revision No.69 of 2014, once again 
provided the appellant a chance to cross-examine the prosecution 
witnesses on the date already fixed before the learned trial court, but he 
chose not to do so. As a result, his right of cross-examination was 

Crl. Appeal No.544 of 2015 
5
again closed, whereupon the appellant filed Criminal Revision No.194 of 
2015, which was dismissed by this Court vide order dated 30.10.2015. 
Keeping in view the aforementioned facts, learned Law Officer assisted 
by counsel for the complainant emphasized that since the prosecution 
witnesses were not cross-examined, their evidence is deemed to be 
admitted and as such the prosecution has proved its case upto the hilt.  In 
support of above contention, reliance has been placed on the case 
reported as “Zafar Iqbal v. The State” (PLD 2015 Supreme Court 307). 
 
It is true that due to lethargic attitude of the appellant, his right of 
cross-examination was closed by the learned trial court, but this Court 
still has to determine whether or not the evidence of prosecution 
witnesses, who were not subjected to cross-examination, is sufficient to 
uphold the appellant's conviction and sentences. No hard and fast rule 
has been laid down by the apex Supreme Court of Pakistan in the op.-cit. 
case-law that if the prosecution witnesses are not cross-examined by the 
defence, their statements would be blindly relied upon by the courts of 
law for convicting and sentencing the accused. I am afraid, the above 
principle highlighted by the prosecution is applicable to the cases on civil 
side and not to the criminal cases. It has been well-settled by now that 
the criminal cases should be decided with regard to the totality of 
impressions drawn and inferred from the circumstances of the case rather 
than on the restricted basis of a witness's cross-examination or otherwise 
on a specific fact disclosed by him. Guidance in this respect has been 
sought from the cases reported as “Juwarsing and others v. The State of 
Madhya Pradesh” (AIR 1981 Supreme Court 373) and “Nadeem 
Ramzan v. The State” (2018 SCMR 149). In the latter case, the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has been pleased to hold as under:- 
“4. 
We have specifically attended to the sentence of death 
passed against the appellant and have noticed in that context 
that the motive set up by the prosecution had not been 
established by it. While discussing the motive part of the case the 
High Court had observed that both the eye-witnesses had stated 
about the alleged motive and they had not been cross-examined 
by the defence on that aspect of the case and, thus, the alleged 
motive stood proved. This approach adopted by the High Court 
has been found by us to be fallacious inasmuch as it had been 
clarified by this Court in the case of S. Mahmood Alam Shah v. 
The State (PLD 1987 SC 250) that the principle that a fact would 

Crl. Appeal No.544 of 2015 
6
be deem to be proved if the witness stating such fact had not been 
cross-examined regarding the same was a principle applicable 
to civil cases and not to criminal cases. It was held that a 
criminal case is to be decided on the basis of totality of 
impressions gathered from the circumstances of the case and not 
on the narrow ground of cross-examination or otherwise of a 
witness on a particular fact stated by him. A similar view had 
already been expressed by this Court in the case of State v. Rab 
Nawaz and another (PLD 1974 SC 87) wherein it had been 
observed that a criminal case is to be decided on the basis of 
totality of circumstances and not on the basis of a single 
element.” 
11. 
After scanning the prosecution evidence, it transpires that 
according to the crime report (Exh.PA), the appellant being a supervisor 
of Water Management Department, Bahawalpur, embezzled an amount 
of Rs.13,25,000/- from the bank accounts of watercourse committees, 
who were supervising outlets (موگا) Nos.119415-R and 126024-R of 
Mauza Aghapur Tehsil Bahawalpur; he obtained five blank signed 
cheques from the president and treasurer of watercourse committee 
pertaining to outlet (موگا) No.119415-R of Mauza Aghapur and he also 
took into custody cheque book of Anjuman Islah-e-Aabpashan ( انجمن
اصالحِ آب پاشاں) pertaining to outlet (موگا) No.126024-R of Mauza 
Aghapur. According to the statement of Rana Javed Iqbal, DDO (WM) 
Bahawalpur (PW.2), the appellant received five blank cheques from 
Bashir Ahmad, chairman and Hafiz Muhammad Sabir, treasurer of 
watercourse committee regarding outlet (موگا) No.119415-R of Mauza 
Aghapur and he (appellant) also took cheque book from Hazoor Bakhsh 
(PW.4), chairman and Haji Nazeer Ahmad (PW.5), treasurer of 
watercourse committee outlet (موگا) No.126024-R of Mauza Aghapur. It 
further manifests from the statement of Rana Javed Iqbal, DDO (WM) 
Bahawalpur (PW.2) that out of five blank cheques, the appellant had 
drawn Rs.8,85,000/- through two cheques; the amount of one cheque to 
the tune of Rs.7,35,000/- was got transferred in the account titled as Bilal 
Building Material supplier while the other cheque of Rs.1,50,000/- was 
drawn by the appellant while writing the word “self”. Rana Javed Iqbal, 
DDO (WM) Bahawalpur (PW.2) further stated that another amount of 
Rs.4,40,000/- was got transferred to Bilal Building Material supplier 

Crl. Appeal No.544 of 2015 
7
through cheque No.5208701 and in this way an amount of Rs.13,25,000/- 
was embezzled by the appellant.  
 
It is noteworthy that according to prosecution’s own version, all 
five signed blank cheques were pertaining to outlet (موگا) No.119415-R 
of Mauza Aghapur and it is also an admitted position in this case that 
Bashir Ahmad, chairman and Hafiz Muhammad Sabir, treasurer of 
watercourse committee regarding this outlet (موگا), were not produced in 
evidence. More so, the prosecution has not brought on the file during its 
evidence any forensic analysis report to prove that the cheques in 
question were filled by the appellant. Likewise, the prosecution has also 
failed to produce before the learned trial court any bank employee to 
establish that the cheques were presented by the appellant before the 
concerned bank for transfer of amount in the account of Bilal Building 
Material supplier. These lapses, discrepancies and inconsistencies on the 
part of prosecution goes to the root of its case and badly shattered the 
same. Reliance is placed on the case titled as “Muhammad Asif v.  
Tanveer Iqbal and 2 others” (2021 YLR 324). 
 
So far as the factum of taking cheque book from watercourse 
committee regarding outlet (موگا) No.126024-R of Mauza Aghapur is 
concerned, both learned Law Officer as well as learned counsel for the 
complainant frankly conceded that there is no allegation against the 
appellant that he put forged signatures of chairman and treasurer of this 
outlet (موگا) on any cheque or withdrew any amount through encashment 
of any cheque pertaining to this outlet (موگا). In this way, the statements 
of Hazoor Bakhsh (PW.4), chairman and Haji Nazeer Ahmad (PW.5), 
treasurer of watercourse committee outlet (موگا) No.126024-R of Mauza 
Aghapur do not offer any help to the prosecution’s case against the 
appellant.  
12. 
Another intriguing aspect of the case which cannot be lost sight of 
is that the prosecution remained failed to prove any nexus of appellant 
with the financial affairs of watercourse committees regarding outlets 
(موگا) No.119415-R and 126024-R of Mauza Aghapur and the whole 
evidence is silent in this regard, because, it is an admitted position in this 
case that the affairs of watercourse committees exclusively fell within 

Crl. Appeal No.544 of 2015 
8
the domain of their representatives, who could draw and spend the 
amount  for improvement of watercourses. According to the National 
Program for Improvement of Watercourses in Pakistan (The Punjab 
Component), the appellant’s role was limited to the extent of providing 
regular and frequent supervision and guidance to the watercourse 
committees and nothing else. 
13. 
Learned Law Officer assisted by learned counsel for the 
complainant also argued that an amount of Rs.3,00,000/- was recovered 
from the appellant vide seizure memo (Exh.PC/2) and a sum of 
Rs.1,00,000/- was recovered from him vide seizure memo (Exh.PC/3), 
but they both could not refer anything from the record which could 
persuade the Court to believe that the above mentioned amounts were 
drawn by the appellant through the cheques in dispute. According to the 
prosecution’s own version, the amounts were transferred in the account 
of Bilal Building Material supplier and there is no evidence that the same 
was transferred in his account at the behest of appellant. Moreover, the 
alleged recovered amount has not been produced by the prosecution 
before the learned trial court at the time of evidence, which is another 
crucial factor, therefore on this point as well, the aforementioned 
recoveries have caused dent in the prosecution case.  
 
With regard to the recovery of case-property and its retention with 
the police, I have also swiftly perused the pertinent rules i.e. Rules 22.16, 
22.18, 22.70, 27.16, and 27.17, which are reproduced hereunder:- 
22.16. Case property. - (1) The police shall seize weapons,

inspector, the prosecuting sub-inspector shall be present during 
the verification and shall also sign the certificate. 
 
Likewise, Rules, 14-E, 14-F and 14-H, Part B of Chapter 24, 
Volume III of the Lahore High Court Rules and Orders (Civil and 
Criminal) also deal with the proposition in hand, relevant lines 
whereof are reproduced hereunder:- 
 "14-E. Custody of other articles.---Similar care is often 
required in tracing the custody of prisoner's substances, 
personal food, blood-stained clothes etc. The evidence should 
never leave it doubtful as to what person or persons have had 
charge of such articles throughout the various stages of the 
inquiry if such doubt can be cleared up. This is especially 
necessary in the cases of articles sent to the Chemical Examiner. 
The person who packs, seals and dispatches such articles should 

Crl. Appeal No.544 of 2015 
13
invariably be examined. 
 
14-F. Every article to be produced.---Clothes, weapons, money, 
ornaments, food and every article which forms a part of the 
circumstantial evidence should be produced in Court and their 
connection with the case and identity should be proved by 
witnesses. 
 
14-H. Exhibits.---All exhibits should be marked with a letter or 
numbers, Articles which are produced in evidence should have a 
label attached to them bearing a number, and that number should 
be quoted throughout the record wherever any such article is 
referred to and should be distinctly marked as "admitted or not 
admitted". If the exhibits have already been assigned numbers by 
the police, that series of numbers should be mentioned to avoid 
confusion. 
 
A printed label should be affixed or attached to each exhibit 
containing the following particulars:- 
 
(i) Number of exhibit 
 
(ii) Produced by 
 
(iii) Admitted (Signature of Court) 
 
(iv) Date 
 
(v) Case 
 
(vi) Description of exhibits. 
 
The Sessions Judge, should see that these entries are property 
made. 
 
In addition to the above, there is no evidence at all that the case-
property i.e. currency notes valuing Rs.4,00,000/- were disposed of 
pending trial in terms of section 516-A, Cr.P.C. by the court of 
competent jurisdiction, therefore, in the eventuality of above 
mentioned facts, I have no hesitation to hold that the prosecution has 
failed to prove the recovery of Rs.4,00,000/- from the possession of 
appellant. Reliance is placed on the cases titled as “State of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan through Deputy Attorney-General for Pakistan 
v. Kenneth Marshal and 2 others” (2005 SCMR 594) and “Gul Dast 
Khan v. The State” (2009 SCMR 431). 
14. 
   Epitome of the above comprehensive discussion is that the 
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond 
the shadow of doubt rather the shadows of doubt are looming large in 
this case. It is a well-established principle of administration of justice 
in criminal cases that finding of guilt against an accused cannot be 
based merely on the high probabilities that may be inferred from 
evidence in a given case. The findings as regard the guilt of accused 
should be rested surely and firmly on the evidence produced in the case 

Crl. Appeal No.544 of 2015 
14
and the plain inferences of guilt that may irresistibly be drawn from 
that evidence. Mere conjectures and probabilities cannot take the place 
of proof. If a case is decided merely on high probabilities regarding 
the existence or non-existence of a fact to prove the guilt of a person, 
the golden rule of giving "benefit of doubt" to an accused person, 
which has been a dominant feature of the administration of criminal 
justice in this country with the consistent approval of the 
Constitutional Courts, will be reduced to a naught. The prosecution is 
under obligation to prove its case against the accused at the standard 
of proof required in criminal cases, beyond reasonable doubt standard, 
and cannot be said to have discharged this obligation by producing 
evidence that merely meets the preponderance of probability. If the 
prosecution fails to discharge its said obligation and there remains a 
reasonable doubt, not an imaginary or artificial doubt, as to the guilt 
of the accused, the benefit of that doubt is to be given to the accused 
as of right, not as of concession. Reference is made to the cases titled 
“Sajjad Hussain v. The State and others” (2022 SCMR 1540) and 
“Tajamal Hussain Shah v. The State and another” (2022 SCMR 
1567). 
15. 
For the foregoing reasons,` Criminal Appeal No.544 of 2015 
filed by Muhammad Tasleem appellant is accepted, his convictions 
and sentences are set aside and he is acquitted of the charges leveled 
against him while extending the benefit of doubt in his favour. He is 
present in the Court by way of suspension of his sentences, his sureties 
stand discharged from the liability of bail bonds.
