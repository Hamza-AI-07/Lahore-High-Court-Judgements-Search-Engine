Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. This single judgment shall govern the title 
petition (W.P.No.3344-R of 2023) as well as connected W.Ps.No.3099-R of 
2023 and 1531-R of 2023 as all these petitions are raising common questions 
of fact and law. 
Brief Background of W.P.Nos.3344-R and 1531-R of 2023. 
2.  
 
Facts forming back ground of both these petitions are that the 
petitioner namely Sheikh Siddique Ahmad claims himself owner of property 
No.D-158 situated in Bohar Bazar, Rawalpindi (hereinafter referred to as 
“property in dispute”). The title of the petitioner is rested upon registered 
sale deed No.6381 dated 19th August, 1987. As per claim of the petitioner, 
“property in dispute” was initially in occupation of Mst. Budhan Bibi as it 
was transferred to her on 24th October, 1964 through Permanent Transfer 
Date of hearing: 
19th, 25th and 30th of October, 2023.

Deed (PTD). It is asserted in the petition that later on “property in dispute” 
devolved upon various persons through different registered sale deeds and 
finally the petitioner purchased it from Muhammad Munir Sheikh s/o 
Muhammad Ajumand and since its purchase he is exclusive lawful owner in 
possession of the same. It is asserted that the petitioner is the brother of 
Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed, the famous politician and the “property in dispute” 
is in his use as his political headquarter since its purchase. The claim of the 
petitioner is that after the change of regime of Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI) 
government, the respondents are continuously extending threats to the 
proprietary and possessory rights of the petitioner on the basis of political 
victimization. As per contents of the petition, a frivolous reference under 
sections 8 and 10 of the Evacuee Trust Properties (Management and 
Disposal) Act (XIII of 1975) (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1975”) was 
filed before the Chairman Evacuee Trust Property Board, Government of 
Punjab, Lahore (hereinafter referred to as “Chairman ETPB”). It is 
canvassed by the petitioner that the “Chairman ETPB” without affording him 
proper opportunity of hearing, decided the reference by way of order dated 
14th September, 2023, whereby he directed the Deputy Administrator, ETPB, 
Rawalpindi to take over the management and control of property bearing 
No.D-156, D-157 and D-158 situated in Bohar Bazar City, District 
Rawalpindi and deal with the same in accordance with “Act, 1975”, which is 
now impugned in the subject petition whereas connected W.P.No.1531-R of 
2023 is though arising from the same facts but challenging the proceedings 
initiated by the “Chairman ETPB” on the reference filed by respondent No.2, 
being illegal, unlawful and coram non judice.  
Brief Background of W.P.No.3099-R of 2023 
3. 
 
In this petition, it is the stance of the petitioner Abida Shamim 
that she is owner of the property bearing No.D-156 situated in Bohar Bazar 
under registered sale deed No.488 dated 22nd January, 2004 but her property 
has been sealed by the respondents without any lawful authority. 
4.  
 
Needless to mention here that in the light of stance taken by the 
respondent department (“ETPB”) that the “property in dispute” is the 

3 
 
 
 
                  W.Ps.No.3344-R, 1531-R and 3099-R of 2023. 
 
 
 
integral part of property No.D-158 and there exists no such independent 
property as D-156, the fate of this petition would be dependent upon the 
subject petition. 
5. 
 
Before proceeding further, it would also not be out of place to 
mention here that with the culmination of the proceedings before the 
“Chairman ETPB”, during the pendency of said petition, all the questions 
raised therein can also be looked into in the subject petition. 
6. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner, while giving factual 
background with regard to the title of the property, submitted that the 
“property in dispute” is not an evacuee property and as such the proceedings 
under the “Act, 1975” are highly unwarranted. While drawing the attention 
of the Court to the reference petition, learned counsel submitted that though it 
does not relate to the properties No.D-156 and D-157 but in furtherance of 
the reference, the respondents have also sealed the property No.D-156 owned 
by the sister of the petitioner. Learned counsel contended that the 
proceedings before the “Chairman ETPB” are tainted with malafide.  It is 
added that the appointment of Chairman was for a specified period and on its 
expiry, Chairman was precluded to proceed with the reference. Emphasized 
that the proceedings are thus coram non judice. It is also added that a 
question with regard to jurisdiction was also raised by the petitioner but it 
was never attended at all. Learned counsel maintained that the proceedings 
are not transparent at all. In order to supplement his contentions, learned 
counsel has placed reliance on ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR, EVACUEE 
TRUST PROPERTY v. MUHAMMAD AYUB and others (2003 SCMR 841), 
IZHAR ALAM FAROOQI, ADVOCATE v. Sheikh ABDUL SATTAR LASI and 
others (2008 SCMR 240) and Mst. REMAT BIBI and others v. FEDERAL 
SECRETARY, GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN, Ministry of Minorities and 3 
others (2020 MLD 440).  
7. 
 
On the other hand, learned Additional Attorney General for 
Pakistan submitted that the “property in dispute” was a “Sarai Sehglan”. He 
added that the “property in dispute” is an evacuee property by all means and 
as such reference was rightly proceeded. Learned Law Officer submitted that 

4 
 
 
 
                  W.Ps.No.3344-R, 1531-R and 3099-R of 2023. 
 
 
 
the petitioner has no right whatsoever and as such the constitutional petition 
is not maintainable. He has placed reliance on MUHAMMAD SADIQ KHAN 
v. SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN, MINISTRY OF 
MINORITIES (MINORITIES AFFAIRS DIVISION), ISLAMABAD and others 
(2014 SCMR 478), SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN, 
MINORITIES AFFAIRS DIVISION, ISLAMABAD and 2 others v. Mst. SHAH 
JEHAN BANO and others (2005 SCMR 907) and FAYYAZUDDIN KHAN v. 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN through Secretary to the 
Government of Pakistan, Minorities Affairs Division, Islamabad and others 
(2009 SCMR 362). 
8.  
 
On the other hand, learned Legal Advisor representing the 
“ETPB” at the very outset raised the question of maintainability of this 
petition on the ground that remedy of revision is available to the petitioner 
against the impugned order. It is submitted that the remedy under section 17 
of the “Act, 1975” is efficacious and adequate. It is contended with 
vehemence by the learned Legal Advisor that the proceedings were conducted 
in a transparent manner. In order to supplement his contentions, he has also 
drawn the attention of the Court towards the relevant documents appended 
with the comments submitted by the department. Learned Legal Advisor 
contended that the Chairman was competent to decide the reference as his 
tenure was extended through notification dated 10th August, 2023. It is 
argued with vehemence that the impugned order has addressed all the 
questions involved in the reference and it is unexceptionable. In order to 
supplement his contentions, he placed reliance on SANA JAMALI v. MUJEEB 
QAMAR and another (2023 SCMR 316) and FARZAND RAZA NAQVI and 5 
others v. MUHAMMAD DIN through Legal Heirs and others (2004 SCMR 
400). 
9. 
 
Mr. Imran Hassan Ali, Advocate/Amicus Curiae after giving 
historical background of the evacuee laws, added that from the contents of 
the available record, it appears that the “property in dispute” was an 
evacuee property at the time of its purchase. He added that in his estimation, 
section 10 of the “Act, 1975” would perhaps not come to the rescue of the 

5 
 
 
 
                  W.Ps.No.3344-R, 1531-R and 3099-R of 2023. 
 
 
 
petitioner but his rights should have been protected under section 41 of the 
Transfer of Property Act, 1882. Learned Amicus submitted that a property, 
which is used in past as Sarai, would not attain the status of the evacuee 
property automatically. He added that the respondent department initiated 
the proceedings against the petitioner after a lapse of considerable time, 
which reflects some malafide on behalf of department. In the last, learned 
Amicus while making reference to FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through 
Secretary, Ministry of Religious Affairs/Minority Affairs, Government of 
Pakistan, Islamabad v. Mufti IFTIKHAR-UD-DIN and another (2000 SCMR 
1), submitted that the revision under section 17 of the “Act, 1975” is not an 
adequate remedy. In support of his contentions, learned amicus has relied 
upon FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN and another v. KHURSHID 
ZAMAN KHAN and others (1999 SCMR 1007) and Kuldip Chand and 
another v. Advocate General to Government of Himachal Pradesh and others 
(AIR 2003 Supreme Court 1685). 
10. 
 
Heard. Record perused. 
11. 
  
Before delving into the matter in issue, it would be apt to 
mention here that the subject petition arises out of order dated 14th 
September, 2023 passed on a reference under sections 8 and 10 of the “Act, 
1975”, which is clearly an offshoot of order dated 30th January, 2023 passed 
in W.P.No.335 of 2023 in the previous round. For the purpose of convenience 
and ease of reference, same is reproduced below: - 
4. 
Apparently through instant petition, the petitioners have 
canvassed their grievance with regard to property No.D-158 situated in 
Bohr Bazar, Rawalpindi City (commonly known as “Lal Haveli”) and 
the properties No.1-1711-0218-0, 1-1711-0221-0,      1-1711-0222-0, 1-
1711-0225-0, 1-1711-0226-0, 1-1711-0227-0, which are appertaining 
the same. It is claim of the petitioners that by virtue of registered sale 
deed bearing No.6381 dated 19th August, 1987, they are exclusive 
owners in possession of the former property whereas for the rest of the 
properties (units), they have applied to the department under the 
prevalent scheme for the validation of their status, which matter is sub 
judice before respondent No.1 in appeal under section 16 of the Evacuee 
Trust Properties (Management and Disposal) Act, 1975. Though status 
of the petitioners with regard to the first property has been called in 
question today but it is an admitted position on all hands that till date no 
proceedings in terms of section 8 of the Act ibid have been initiated by 
the respondents. At the time of first call, on account of some confusion 
in the factual aspects of the matter, learned Law Officer was directed to 

6 
 
 
 
                  W.Ps.No.3344-R, 1531-R and 3099-R of 2023. 
 
 
 
ensure presence of respondents No.1 and 2 alongwith all the relevant 
record. They are in attendance and are unanimous in their stance that 
property forming part of registered sale deed No.6381 dated 19th August, 
1987 is not yet sealed and having an access through independent path, 
which aspect is affirmed by the learned counsel alongwith petitioner 
No.2. 
5. 
In the light of above, a consensus has developed interse all in 
attendance that if the respondents questioned the status of the petitioners 
under the registered sale deed mentioned hereinabove, they shall not 
take any adverse action to this extent except having a recourse to the 
provisions of the Act ibid, leaving the petitioners to avail any kind of 
remedy in response thereto. 
6. 
Qua rest of the properties, both the sides have consented that if 
the petitioners appear before respondent No.1 in person or through any 
authorized representative on 1st February, 2023 in his office, the pending 
appeal relating to the said properties shall be decided within fortnight 
therefrom. 
7. 
With these observations, instant petition is disposed of 
accordingly. 
It is thus apparent that reference in question was filed in pursuance to the 
above noted order and it was placed before the Chairman being reference 
under sections 8 and 10 of the “Act, 1975” relating to the properties bearing 
Nos.D-156, D-157 and D-158 situated at Bohar Bazar, Rawalpindi being the 
evacuee trust properties as per municipal record maintained for the year 
1900. It is asserted in the reference that the site is known as Sarai, hence the 
same is trust in nature for the last more than 122 years. Though in the 
headnote of the reference, properties No.D-156 and D-157 were mentioned 
but in para-4, it is asserted that no such properties exist and it is only one 
property i.e. D-158 at the site. It is quite strange that despite this clear 
assertion in one of the paras of the reference, in the latter part, more 
specifically in para-9 of reference, it is stated that (after obtaining record 
from the concerned authorities, reference against properties bearing Nos.D-
156 and D-157 will be separately filed before the Chairman court, if, it 
discover that the properties are evacuee trust properties). This clearly was a 
self-contradictory stance in the reference. 
12. 
 
The petitioner submitted his written objections wherein he has 
taken a categorical stance that the “property in dispute” is not an evacuee 
property and it is his personal ownership, which was purchased through 
registered sale deed No.6381 dated 19th August, 1987. As per claim of the 
petitioner, the “property in dispute” was previously in occupation of Mst.

                  W.Ps.No.3344-R, 1531-R and 3099-R of 2023. 
 
 
 
Budhan Bibi since partition and it was transferred to her on 24th October, 
1964 through Permanent Transfer Deed (PTD) and later on after passing 
through various subsequent purchasers through different registered sale 
deeds, finally the petitioner purchased it from Muhammad Munir Sheikh 
through registered sale deed in question. Through the connected petition 
(W.P.No.1531-R of 2023), the petitioner challenged the vires of the 
proceedings before the “Chairman ETPB” being patently illegal, unlawful 
and without lawful authority. 
13. 
 
“Act, 1975” was promulgated to provide for the management 
and disposal of evacuee properties attached to charitable, religious or 
educational trusts or institutions. Section 2(d) defines the evacuee trust 
property as under: - 
2(d) 
“Evacuee trust property” means evacuee trust properties attached 
to charitable, religious or educational trusts or institutions or any other 
properties which form part of Trust Pool constituted under this Act;” 
Section 8 of the “Act, 1975” bestows power upon the Chairman to decide a 
question as to whether an evacuee property is attached to a charitable, 
religious or educational trust or institution or not. If the Chairman reaches at 
the conclusion that an evacuee property is an evacuee trust property, he 
shall, by notification in the official Gazette, declare such property to be 
evacuee trust property.  
14. 
 
Section 10 of the “Act, 1975”, on the other hand deals with the 
validation of certain transfers. For ready reference and convenience, it is 
reproduced below:- 
  
10. Validation of certain transfers. (1) An immovable evacuee 
trust property;  
(a) 
if situated in a rural area and utilized bona fide under any 
Act prior to June, 1964, for allotment against the satisfaction of 
verified claims; and 
(b) 
if situated in an urban area and utilized bona fide under 
any Act for transfer against the satisfaction of verified claim in 
respect of which Permanent Transfer Deeds were issued prior to 
June, 1968, shall be deemed to have been validly transferred to 
sale to the Chief Settlement Commissioner, and the sale proceeds 

8 
 
 
 
                  W.Ps.No.3344-R, 1531-R and 3099-R of 2023. 
 
 
 
thereof shall be reimbursed to the Board and shall form part of 
the Trust Pool. 
(2) 
If a question arises whether a transaction referred to in 
sub-section (1) is bona fide or not, it shall be decided by the Chairman 
whose decision shall be final and shall not be called in question in any 
court. 
(3) 
If it is decided that transaction referred to in sub-section 
(1) is not bona fide the Chairman may pass an order cancelling the 
allotment or transfer of such property: Provided that decision under sub-
section (2) or order under sub-section (3) shall be taken or passed in 
respect of any property without giving the person affected a reasonable 
opportunity of being heard. 
15. 
 
After having the comparative analysis of both the provisions 
referred hereinabove, it becomes manifestly clear that there is a marked 
distinction between them. Section 8 is meant to deal with the question as to 
status of the property and if there is some dispute qua the actual status of the 
property, it is the Chairman, who is competent to decide such question and to 
declare such property as evacuee trust property. On the other hand, section 
10 presupposes that the property in question is evacuee trust property and it 
empowers the Chairman in case a question arises as to whether a transaction 
referred to in sub-section 1 is bona fide or not to decide the same. Sub-section 
(3) ordains that if transaction referred to in sub-section (1) is not bona fide, 
the Chairman may pass an order cancelling the allotment or transfer of such 
property nevertheless such decision either under sub-section (2) or order 
under sub-section (3) shall be taken or passed in respect of property after 
affording reasonable opportunity of hearing to the affected person.  
16. 
 
It is apparent from the tenor of the impugned order that the 
Chairman ultimately proceeded with the reference in terms of section 10 of 
the “Act, 1975”. It is also noticed that through the impugned order, the 
Chairman on the one hand held that the “property in dispute” is an evacuee 
property and simultaneously while invoking the provisions of section 10 of the 
“Act, 1975” proceeded to cancel the sale deed in favour of the petitioner 
being bogus.  
17. 
 
Before embarking upon the validity of the proceedings 
conducted by the Chairman and the propriety of the impugned order, it would 

9 
 
 
 
                  W.Ps.No.3344-R, 1531-R and 3099-R of 2023. 
 
 
 
be apposite to first examine the question of maintainability of constitutional 
petition in the light of objection taken by the respondents. Law to this effect is 
well established that constitutional jurisdiction cannot be curtailed or 
abridged though subservient statutes. If the proceedings or order is patently 
illegal or perverse and the alternate remedy is not efficacious or adequate, 
the constitutional jurisdiction can be exercised despite availability of 
alternate remedy. In past, the provisions of the “Act, 1975” became under 
consideration of Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN through Secretary, Ministry of Religious Affairs/Minority Affairs, 
Government of Pakistan, Islamabad v. Mufti IFTIKHAR-UD-DIN and 
another (2000 SCMR 1) and it was held as under: - 
“The providing of right of appeal against order of the Chairman 
passed under section 8 of Act XIII of 1975 should have been provided to 
comply with the requirements of principles of administration of justice 
in Islam as immunity sought to be granted to such an order by providing 
an inadequate remedy of revision would be repugnant to the injunctions 
of Islam. The appellant is accordingly directed to suitably amend the 
Evacuee Trust Properties (Management and Disposal Act, 1975) (Act 
XIII of 1975) by inserting a provision providing right of appeal against 
the order passed by the Chairman under section 8 of the Act XIII of 
1975. Such an appeal can be provided to lie before the High Court in 
line with the recourse adopted in the Displaced Persons (Compensation 
and Rehabilitation) Act, 1958 and the Displaced Persons (Land 
Settlement) Act, 1958. If the declaration as to the nature of the property 
made by the Chief Settlement Commissioner and later by the Chairman 
could be made scrutable through an appeal to the High Court, no 
possible objection can be raised to the providing of the same remedy 
now under Act XIII of 1975. It is also to be noted that against the orders 
passed on other matter by the officers appointed by the Board, appeal 
has been provided to the higher officers of the hierarchy including the 
Chairman and against orders so passed the revision lies to the Federal 
Government. The said course of action can continue as before, as final 
order so passed is further assailable before the High Court by invoking 
the constitutional jurisdiction vesting in it under Article 199 of the 
Constitution and a further petition for leave to appeal before the 
Supreme Court under Article 185 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The remedies, so provided, considering the 
nature of the legislature are in such matters sufficient and adequate. The 
amendment directed in the above terms shall be made in Act XIII of 
1975 by the appellant by the 30th July, 1999. 
 
 
 
The appeal disposed of accordingly.”  
18. 
 
Even otherwise, remedy of revision in terms of section 17 of the 
“Act, 1975” lies before the Federal Government and it is an admitted 
position that though the revision petition was filed by the petitioner but it is 

10 
 
 
 
                  W.Ps.No.3344-R, 1531-R and 3099-R of 2023. 
 
 
 
not entertained and proceeded on account of non-availability of the Secretary 
concerned. The objection to this effect is, thus, not only ill-founded but 
misconceived.  
19. 
 
At the cost of repetition, it is observed that the stance of the 
petitioner is that the “property in dispute” is not an evacuee property, which 
though may not have legs to stand on scrutiny. The respondents, on the other 
hand, asserted that the “property in dispute” is recorded as Sarai in the 
municipal record and as such it is an evacuee property right from the day 
first. In order to provide for the regulation of public Sarais and Puraos, the 
Sarais Act, 1867 was promulgated, which is quite relevant to determine the 
nature of the property used as such. Moreover, memo No.4498-PL-Reh/160 
dated 9th/16th March, 1960 was issued for the disposal of Sarais and Mandis, 
which reads as under: - 
Disposal of Sarais and Mandis 
In certain towns of West Pakistan there are a few evacuee Sarais and 
Mandis consisting of more than one residential or commercial units. The 
Chief Settlement Commissioner has decided that such premises may be 
divided into houses and shops as the case may be, and each unit 
disposed of separately on the same basis as a house or a shop is disposed 
of. Persons occupying individual residential or commercial units may be 
permitted to submit CH, CS, KCH, KCS, NCH, NCS, KNCH, KNCS 
and LH Forms as the case may be, if they have not submitted such, 
forms already. If a particular unit cannot be transferred to the person in 
possession, the residential unit may be included in the earmarking list 
and the commercial unit put to auction. 
20. 
 
Needless to reiterate that a memo has the force of law. The term 
'memorandum' in this new generic sense began to be used in the later 1870s 
and early 1880s, although it did not become common until the 1920s, by 
which time the form of the memo was in widespread use. Office memorandum 
is a special order of the Government. Basically, an Office Memorandum is a 
document released by a proper authority stating the government's policy or 
decision. It is recognized as an order from the government or a circular 
released by the executive branch. An office memorandum is thus not a stray 
paper rather it has the force of law. Guidance in this respect can be sought 
from SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB, IRRIGATION 
AND POWER DEPARTMENT, IRRIGATION SECRETARIAT, LAHORE 

11 
 
 
 
                  W.Ps.No.3344-R, 1531-R and 3099-R of 2023. 
 
 
 
versus ABDUL HAMID ARIF and others (1991 SCMR 628). Reliance in this 
respect can also be placed on MUHAMMAD SALEEM versus FEDERAL 
PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION and others (2020 SCMR 221) wherein the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court held as under:- 
“14……….Now, it was common ground before us that these Office 
Memorandums had the force of law. The question however is: what is 
the legal source of the power whereby, or in terms whereof, these 
Office Memorandums have been issued? This question is of central 
importance to deciding this appeal since it will be recalled that one 
basic objection taken by the appellant to the ML&C Group OM is that 
it is (in relevant part) inconsistent with the 1973 Act and the rules 
framed thereunder and must therefore yield to, and before, the latter. 
15. 
Keeping the foregoing analysis in mind it is our view that the 
legal source for the issuance of the Office Memorandums can only be 
the 1973 Act itself. Thus, the legal power whereby the Office 
Memorandums have been issued is nothing other than an aspect (and 
exercise) of the rule making power conferred in terms of section 
25(1). The reason is that, as shown above, the present Constitution 
has removed entirely the earlier direct and independent grant of rule 
making power on the Executive branch. On the constitutional plane 
there is now only one repository of the power in relation to the 
appointment and the terms and conditions of service of civil servants, 
and that is the legislature. It would therefore be incorrect to posit that, 
notwithstanding this important and in many ways fundamental change 
from the past, the Executive branch nonetheless somehow continues 
to have (perhaps on some residual basis) a direct and independent 
power in this regard. That cannot be so. Even a bare glance at the 
Office Memorandums shows that they are concerned with the terms 
and conditions of service of the civil servants who fall within the 
relevant Group. It will also be recalled that in terms of section 25(2) 
not only rules but also the orders and instructions carrying over from 
previous dispensations were deemed to be "rules" under the statute. 
Even though the Office Memorandums do not formally make 
reference to section 25 it surely cannot be otherwise with regard to 
terms and conditions settled under them after the commencement of 
the present Constitution. In our view therefore, in law the Office 
Memorandums whereby the Occupational Groups are established 
emanate from, and are an exercise of, the rule making power 
conferred on the "President or any person authorized by the President 
in this behalf". 
16. 
If, as we have just concluded, the legal source from which the 
Office  Memorandums emanate is the rule making power, it 
necessarily follows that they are co-equal with other rules framed in 
terms thereof, such as the APT Rules. In other words, they cannot be 
considered subordinate to such rules. It follows from this that the 
Office Memorandums cannot, in case of any inconsistency, be 
regarded as yielding to the rules otherwise made under section 25 
(i.e., more formally with specific reference thereto). Since in the legal 
hierarchy they are of equal standing, the Office Memorandums and 
rules such as the APT Rules must be read together in a harmonized 
and consistent manner, to the maximum extent possible. It is only if

there is an irreconcilable difference that the question of which will 
prevail would arise. And that question would have to be addressed by 
resort to well established rules of interpretation, including (but not 
limited to) those such as relating to earlier versus later in time, or 
general versus specific etc. Which particular rule(s) of interpretation 
would actually apply (and how) would depend on the actual 
provisions under consideration and the context in which they 
operate.” 
21. 
 
From the tentative assessment of the available material, it can 
safely be observed that on account of serious differences interse parties with 
regard to the status of the “property in dispute”, long standing title document 
(registered sale deed) in favour of the petitioner, silence of the respondent 
department for a long period of time to take any action against the petitioner, 
the matter in issue cannot be resolved in a summary manner. Sub-section (3) 
of section 10 of the “Act, 1975” guarantees the providing of reasonable 
opportunity of hearing to the affected person. Even otherwise, Article 10-A of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,1973 safeguards such 
right of the affectees. There is no cavil that the Chairman has the exclusive 
authority to determine the questions relating to the status of the property, 
being evacuee trust property and to pass a decision about the validation of 
certain transfers relating to the evacuee trust property but if the reference 
before the Chairman involves intricacy of facts, that cannot be decided in a 
summary and slipshod manner. This was apparently the reason that section 
21 was added in the “Act, 1975”, which bestows power of a civil court upon 
the Federal Government or any person authorized by it, the Chairman and 
every Officer appointed under this Act for the purposes of making any inquiry 
or hearing in appeal or revision under the Act for the matters mentioned 
therein. I am mindful of the fact that though various substantial questions 
have been raised in this constitutional petition including the question relating 
to the competency of Chairman to proceed with the reference but for avoiding 
any prejudice to the case of either of the sides, it would be in the fitness of 
things not to make any comment on those aspects of the matter leaving both 
the parties to canvass the same before the Chairman. 
22. 
 
For the aforesaid reasons, I am inclined to allow this petition. 
Resultantly impugned order dated 14th September, 2023 is set aside being

illegal and unlawful while declaring all subsequent steps taken by the 
respondents as without lawful authority. As a sequel, reference under sections 
8 and 10 of the “Act, 1975” filed by respondent No.2 shall be deemed to be 
pending before “Chairman ETPB”, who shall hold thorough inquiry and 
probe and afford reasonable opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and then 
decide the same strictly in accordance with law while adhering the provisions 
of the “Act, 1975”. In the meanwhile, “property in dispute” shall be de-
sealed. No order as to costs. 
23. 
 
The above are the detailed reasons for short order dated 30th 
October, 2023, which reads as under: - 
“For the reasons to be recorded later, this petition is allowed. As a result, 
reference filed by the respondent department (Evacuee Trust Property 
Board) shall be deemed to be pending before the Chairman, Evacuee 
Trust Property Board, Government of Pakistan, Lahore, who shall afford 
proper opportunity of hearing to the petitioner as well as all the 
concerned and then decide the same strictly in accordance with law 
while making due compliance to the provisions of Evacuee Trust 
Properties (Management and Disposal) Act, 1975. In the meanwhile, the 
property in question (D-158, Bohar Bazar, Rawalpindi) shall be                   
de-sealed.”
