                  Raheel Kamran J:- By this single judgment, I 
intend to decide the titled petition, Writ Petition No.49857 of 2024, 
Writ Petition No.50600 of 2024 and Writ Petition No.50310 of 2024 
as common question of law, that is, imposition of condition on grant 
of stay, is involved therein.  
2.      Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the Appellate 
Tribunal Inland Revenue (‘Appellate Tribunal’) is the first 
independent forum and any injunctive order passed by it must state 
reasons for imposing any condition or else the object and purpose of 
appeal will stand negated.  He maintains that section 131(5) of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (‘Ordinance’) does not visualize any 

2 
W.P.No.50303 of 2024 
condition for grant of stay and the discretion exercised by the 
Appellate Tribunal by imposing conditions in these matters is 
unlawful.  He further contends that power to grant stay is unhindered 
and the same cannot be evaded by imposing the impugned condition.   
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents-department 
contends that the Appellate Tribunal is possessed of discretionary 
power to stay recovery of any tax due by virtue of any order being 
assailed, subject to restrictions or limitations and that the impugned 
conditions in the instant cases depict only reasonable exercise of 
judicial discretion. 
4. 
Heard. 
5. 
Record reflects that in the titled petition, stay against recovery 
of impugned tax demand has been granted for a period of 30 days 
subject to payment of 10% out of total tax demand within five days;  
in W.P.No.49857 of 2024, stay for a period of 60 days has been 
granted subject to payment of Rupees 50 million out of total tax 
demand within five days; in W.P.No.50600 of 2024, stay for a 
period of 30 days has been granted subject to payment of 5% of the 
disputed tax demand; and in W.P.No.50310 of 2024 stay for a period 
of 15 days has been granted subject to deposit of 25% of total tax 
demand.  
6. 
Appellate Tribunal is the first extra-departmental/independent 
forum for deciding the disputes vis-à-vis tax liability under the 
Ordinance.  Historically, in acknowledgment of the principle of 
unrestricted access to justice, this Court as well as other High Courts 
have been granting stay against recovery of any tax demanded by the 
concerned revenue authorities till decision of appeal before at least 
one extra-departmental forum1.  The federal legislature has by and 
                                                 
1 Messrs Pak Saudi Fertilizers vs. Federation of Pakistan and others (2002 PTD 679), 
   Z. N. Exporters (Pvt.) Ltd. vs. Collector of Sales Tax (2003 PTD 1746), 
 Brothers Engineering (Pvt.) Ltd vs. Appellate Tribunal Sales Tax (2003 PTD 1836), 
 Messrs Fauji Oil Terminal and Distribution Company Ltd vs. Pakistan through Secretary Revenue    
 Division and 2 others (2012 PTD 1762) and Messrs Islamabad Electric Supply Company Limited vs. 
Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue and others (2024 PTD 30) 

3 
W.P.No.50303 of 2024 
large manifestly adhered to the same principle while enacting sub-
section (5) of section 131 of the Ordinance, which reads as follows: - 
“131.  Appeal to the Appellate Tribunal.- (1) Subject to section 
126A, any person, other than an SOE, aggrieved by any order 
passed by an officer of Inland Revenue or Commissioner or Chief 
Commissioner or the Board under this Ordinance or the rules 
made thereunder may, within thirty days of the receipt of such 
order, prefer an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal or, as the case 
may be, a reference to the High Court: 
 Provided that where sub-section (11) of section 134A apply, an 
SOE may prefer an appeal under this sub-section. 
 (2)  ………. 
 (3)  ………. 
 (4)  ………. 
 (5)  Notwithstanding that an appeal has been filed under this 
section, tax shall, unless recovery thereof has been stayed by the 
Appellate Tribunal, be payable in accordance with the assessment 
made in the case: 
 Provided that on filing of application in a particular case, the 
Appellate Tribunal may after affording an opportunity of being 
heard to the Commissioner having jurisdiction, for reasons to be 
recorded, stay the recovery of tax for ninety days: 
 Provided further that the stay order shall cease to have effect, 
and the Commissioner shall be entitled to recover tax, if the 
taxpayer does not adhere to the hearing schedule for the appeal, 
as determined by the Appellate Tribunal in accordance with the 
rules made under sub-section (2) of section 130: 
 Provided also that where an appeal is not decided within the 
statutory period by the Appellate Tribunal, the stay order under 
the second proviso shall not cease to have effect till finalization of 
the appeal by the Appellate Tribunal.” 
 
 
It is clearly noted that in the above provisions, authority of the 
Appellate Tribunal to grant stay during pendency of appeal before it 
is not conditioned by the requirement of deposit or payment of 
certain amount of tax determined by the forum below.  In that way, 
the above provisions are quite distinct and distinguishable from sub-
section (10) of section 133 of the Ordinance which restricts or limits 
authority of this Court to stay recovery of tax, while a Tax Reference 
is pending, subject to deposit with the assessing authority of not less 
than 30% of the tax determined by the Appellate Tribunal.   
7. 
No doubt, in the scheme of section 131 of the Ordinance, 
authority of the Appellate Tribunal to stay recovery of tax during 

4 
W.P.No.50303 of 2024 
pendency of an appeal is discretionary, however, to ensure 
unrestricted access to justice and fair determination of tax liability 
before the first extra-departmental/independent forum, such 
discretion ordinarily should be exercised to stay recovery of the tax 
impugned except for the tax liability admitted or not challenged by 
the appellant or the one determined on the basis of binding precedent 
of this Court or the Supreme Court on any issue raised in the appeal. 
8. 
It is noted that the impugned conditions in the orders assailed 
in these petitions have been imposed by the Appellate Tribunal in a 
slipshod manner that hardly shows application of mind on part of the 
Appellate Tribunal, therefore, the same are manifestly arbitrary and 
of no legal effect.      
9. 
In view of above, all four constitutional petitions are allowed 
and the impugned conditions qua deposit of certain amounts of tax, 
as mentioned above, are set aside. The Appellate Tribunal is directed 
to decide appeals of the petitioners within 30 days from the receipt of 
certified copy of this judgment. There shall be no order as to costs.  
Office shall send certified copy of this judgment to the concerned 
Appellate Tribunal.
