JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing: 
 
 
    10.03.2023 
For the Petitioner: 
Mr Shaukat Rafique Bajwa, Advocate, with Mr 
Tauseef Ahmad Bajwa, Advocate. 
For the Respondents: 
Mr Sittar Sahil, Assistant Advocate General, with 
Zia/S.P., Jamshaid Ahmad/SHO and Samra 
Yousaf/S.I. 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Petitioner has lodged FIR 
No.1019/2022 dated 15.10.2022 under section 375-A PPC at Police 
Station Saddar Daska, District Sialkot, against four people accusing them 
of ravishing her. During the investigation, police found that it was not a 
gang rape and substituted section 375-A PPC with section 371-B PPC. 
The Petitioner disagrees with this finding and contends that it has no legal 
value because the entire proceedings were conducted in contravention of 
section 9 of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021  
(the “Anti-Rape Act”). Through this petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Pakistan, 
1973  
(the “Constitution”), she seeks quashing of the said proceedings and a 
direction to the Respondents to reinvestigate the case in accordance with 
the law, i.e., section 9 of the Anti-Rape Act.

The World Health Organization defines sexual violence as 
“any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, or other act directed 
against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of 
their relationship to the victim, in any setting. It includes rape, defined as 
the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or 
anus with a penis, other body part or object, attempted rape, unwanted

sexual touching and other non-contact forms.”1 Sexual violence is 
regarded as one of the most horrific and traumatic human rights 
violations. Although women and girls are more commonly the victims, 
sexual violence can occur at any age. Anyone can commit it, including 
parents, caregivers, acquaintances, strangers, and intimate partners. 
Worldwide, an estimated 20% of girls and 10% of boys are sexually 
abused.2 It has serious short and long-term physical and mental health, 
behavioural and social implications. Girls and women bear the 
overwhelming burden of injury and disease from sexual violence and 
coercion because they are more vulnerable to sexual and reproductive 
health consequences such as unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion and a 
higher risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, during 
vaginal intercourse. It is important to note that in cases of rape, men are 
also at risk of contracting HIV.3 Occasionally, murder is committed 
during or after sexual assault, and sometimes, an honour killing happens 
due to sexual violence. 
4. 
 
The victims of sexual violence often avoid reporting the 
crime. One of the reasons is that criminal proceedings are traumatizing.4 
The 84th Report of the Law Commission of India observed: 
“It is often stated that a woman who is raped undergoes two crises, the 
rape and the subsequent trial. While the first seriously moves her 
dignity, curbs her individual, disturbs her sense of security and may 
often ruin her physically, the second is no less potent of mixture, 
inasmuch as it not only forces her to relive through the traumatic 
experience, but also does so in the grudge of publicity in a totally alien 
atmosphere, with the whole apparatus and paraphernalia of the criminal 
justice system focused upon her.”5 
5. 
 
Pakistan is a signatory to almost all international conventions 
and agreements that protect the rights of women and children and oblige 
State Parties to curb all types of violence against them, including gender-

based violence. Article 4 of Pakistan’s Constitution (1973) stipulates that 
every citizen and every other person, for the time being within the 
country, has an inalienable right to enjoy equal protection of the law and 
be treated in accordance with the law. Chapter 1 of Part II lists the 
fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Over the last two 
decades, the Government has taken various steps to incorporate human 
rights values into its statutes, policies, and action plans.6 It has toughened 
the law to combat rape and sexual offences through the Criminal Law 
Amendment (Offences Relating to Rape) Act (XLIV of 2016) and the 
Criminal Laws (Amendment) Act (LVI of 2021).7  
6. 
 
Parliament has enacted the Anti-Rape Act to assure various 
fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and to discharge 
obligations under international law to address the issue of sexual violence 
and bring offenders to justice. To this end, the Act provides for efficient 
procedures, speedy trials, evidence and matters connected therewith or 
incidental thereto.8 It may be highlighted that being a special legislation, it 
has precedence over all other general laws on the subject it covers. 
7. 
 
Indubitably, the Anti-Rape Act is a remedial social statute.9 
Dodd makes the following observations about such enactments in 
Statutory Interpretation in Ireland:10  
 
“The case law reveals that the courts are more disposed to the 
purposive approach in respect of particular types of enactments. 
Remedial social statutes, enactments relating to international or 
European law and paternal legislation, such as enactments relating to 
child welfare, are more readily interpreted in light of their purpose. In 
respect of such enactments, the courts are concerned with ensuring that 
the purpose or aim of a provision or Act is achieved. In contrast, other 
types of statutes and instruments favour a literal approach – criminal, 
taxation and conveyancing enactments dispose themselves to a strict 
literal approach. In respect of such statutes, what is typically valued is

8 Preamble of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021. 
9 Legislation is a tool for controlling, guiding, and restraining the behaviour of individuals and groups 
in a community. In a broad sense, all laws are social in character, but in a narrow sense, only the laws 
enacted for social welfare are classified as social legislation.  Hence, social legislation may be defined 
as special laws which are passed to improve the socio-economic position of vulnerable groups such as 
women, children, the elderly, scheduled tribes, the physically and intellectually impaired, unorganized 
workers, and agricultural and landless labourers. (Ranjana Sehgal, Social Legislation and Role of Social 
Worker in Legal Assistance).

certainty and allowing those affected to rely on the ordinary and plain 
meaning. 
 
‘Remedial social statutes’ and legislation of a paternal character favour 
a purposive interpretation and are said to be construed as widely and 
liberally as can fairly be done within the constitutional limits of the 
courts’ interpretative role. This formula has been repeated in a number 
of cases. It has been codified to some extent in some jurisdictions. 
Remedial social statutes are enactments which seek to put right a social 
wrong and provide some means to achieve a particular social result. 
The interpretative approach to remedial enactments can be related to 
the mischief rules and purposive approach, in that interpretations that 
promote the remedy that the legislature has appointed are preferred.”11 
8. 
 
In LD v. Chief Appeals Officer, [2014] IEHC 641 at para 38, 
Peart J. stated that remedial social statutes should be “interpreted as 
widely as the words reasonably permit in order to reflect the permissive 
nature of the legislation.” 
9. 
 
In Lalappa Lingappa & others v. Laxmi Vishnu Textile 
Mills Ltd., Sholapur (AIR 1981 SC 852), the Supreme Court of India 
held that when construing a social welfare legislation, the court should 
apply the beneficent rule of construction. If there are two plausible 
readings of a provision, the one that best serves the Act’s policy and is 
more beneficial to the people for whom the Act was passed should be 
preferred. However, where the language is explicit, the court must give it 
effect regardless of the ramifications. The argument of inconvenience and 
hardship is only admissible in cases where the meaning of the statute is 
unclear and there are two ways to interpret it. In their eagerness to 
advance the beneficent purpose of the legislation, the judges must resist 
the temptation of seeking ambiguity where none exists. In Edukanti 
Kistamma (Dead) through L.Rs. & others v. S. Venkatareddy (Dead) 
through L.Rs. & others (AIR 2010 SC 313), the Supreme Court held that 
the Act must be read in its whole for purposes of statutory interpretation. 
The court must give full effect to the Act’s objective and intent by using 
the rules of purposive construction. It must construe the enactment in a 
way that promotes its object and advances the purpose for which it was 
passed and strongly oppose any construction that seeks to reduce a 
statute’s utility. In Regional Provident Fund Commissioner v. Hooghly 
Mills Co. Ltd. & others [2012 (2) SCC 489], the Supreme Court held that 
                                          
11 The Supreme Court of Ireland approvingly cited these excerpts in Brigid Wilton McDonagh v. The 
Chief Appeals Officer and another [2021] IESC 33.

the normal canon of interpretation is that a remedial statute or social 
welfare legislation receives liberal construction. In contrast, a penal 
statute calls for strict interpretation. If there is any doubt in the cases of 
remedial laws, it is resolved in favour of the class of persons for whose 
benefit the statute is enacted. In the cases of penal statutes, doubt is 
generally resolved in favour of the accused. 
10. 
 
The Anti-Rape Act aims to effectively deal with the rape and 
sexual abuse crimes mentioned in its Schedules (which are hereinafter 
referred to as the “Scheduled Offences”) committed against women and 
children. It outlines a framework to check the said crimes by establishing 
(i) Anti-Rape Crisis Cell, (ii) Special Sexual Offences Investigation Units, 
(iii) Independent Support Advisors, (iv) Special Prosecutors, (v) Special 
Courts, (vi) a register of sex offences, and (vii) Fund to carry out the 
purposes of the Act. Each thread is meticulously braided; a break in any 
of them would render the statute ineffective. In light of the principles 
discussed above, the courts must interpret the Anti-Rape Act liberally and 
purposively. They must adopt the construction that advances rather than 
defeats the statute’s objectives.  
11. 
 
Section 9 of the Anti-Rape Act provides a special procedure 
for investigating Scheduled Offences. It states: 
9.  
Investigation in respect of scheduled offences.— (1) For the purposes 
of investigation under this Act, special sexual offences investigation 
units (SSOIUs) shall be established in every district by the provincial 
governments and for the purposes of the Islamabad Capital Territory by 
the federal Government. 
(2) 
The SSOIU shall comprise police officers who have received training 
on investigation in relation to sexual offences and preferably one 
member of the unit shall be a female police officer. 
(3) 
The investigation in respect of offences mentioned under this Act shall 
be carried out as follows: 
(i) 
for offences mentioned in Schedule-I, by the SSOIU; and 
(ii) 
for offences mentioned in Schedule-II, by SSOIU under the 
supervision of a police officer not below the rank of BPS-17. 
(4) 
In case the complainant in relation to an offence under Schedule-II 
expresses dissatisfaction which is based on reasonable grounds, the 
investigation shall be transferred to the district head of investigation of 
the police. 
(5)  
The officers of the SSOIUs shall ordinarily be from the area in which 
the occurrence of the offence has taken place: 
Provided that in exceptional circumstances, and where the dictates of 
fair, accurate and technical investigation warrant otherwise, officers 

Writ Petition No. 75596/2022 
 
- 6 - 
from areas other than the area of occurrence, may be deputed in the 
SSOIUs. 
(6) 
Upon completion of investigation, the SSOIU shall, through the 
prosecutor general or special prosecutors, submit the final report under 
section 173 of the Code before the Special Court. 
12. 
 
In exercise of the powers conferred by section 19(1) of the 
Anti-Rape Act, the Ministry of Law and Justice, on the recommendation 
of the Special Committee established under section 15, has framed Anti-
Rape (Investigation) Rules 2022, which were notified in the Gazette of 
Pakistan on 20 February 2023. 
13. 
 
Sections 10 and 22 of the Anti-Rape Act are also relevant to 
discourse. Section 10 empowers the SSOIUs to take cognizance of the 
offences not specified in the Schedules if they are committed in 
connection with the Scheduled Offences. Section 22(1) makes the false 
investigation a crime. It stipulates that if the investigator fails to carry out 
the investigation properly or diligently, or causes a fraudulent 
investigation to be conducted, or fails to pursue the case in any court of 
law, he will be punished with imprisonment of either description up to 
three years and a fine. It is important to point out that section 22(2) makes 
the filing of a false complaint regarding the commission of the Scheduled 
Offence(s) subject to a similar sanction. 
14. 
 
As adumbrated, the Anti-Rape Act is a special legislation 
that would prevail over any regular law on the subjects it addresses. But 
are the provisions of section 9 mandatory? Parliament has used the word 
“shall” in every sub-section thereof. Generally speaking, this word 
connotes that the provision is obligatory. However, the final test is the 
legislature’s true intent, which the court must discern. In Province of 
Punjab through Conservator of Forest, Faisalabad, and others v. Javed 
Iqbal (2021 SCMR 328), the Supreme Court held: 
 
“In order to determine whether the aforesaid proviso is directory or 
mandatory, the duty of the court is to try to unravel the real intention of 
the legislature. The ultimate test is the intent of the legislature and not 
the language in which the intent is clothed. The object and purpose of 
enacting the provision provide a strong and clear indicator for 
ascertaining such intent of the legislature. The intention of the 
legislature must govern and this is to be ascertained not only from the 
phraseology of the provision but also by considering its nature, its 
object, and the consequences which would follow from construing it 
one way or the other. This exercise entails a careful examination of the 
scheme of the Act in order to discover the real purpose and object of 

Writ Petition No. 75596/2022 
 
- 7 - 
the Act. A provision in a statute is mandatory if the omission to follow 
it renders the proceedings to which it relates illegal and void, while a 
provision is directory if its observance is not necessary to the validity 
of the proceeding. One of the important tests that must always be 
employed in order to determine whether a provision is mandatory or 
directory in character is to consider whether the non-compliance of a 
particular provision causes inconvenience or injustice and, if it does, 
the court would say that that provision must be complied with and that 
it is obligatory in its character.” 
15. 
 
Police investigation is a key component of the criminal 
justice system. It consists of identifying, collecting, conserving, and 
presenting evidence in a court of law. The majority of criminal cases fail 
in courts due to defective investigations. Rape and other sexual violence 
crimes require a thorough investigation, like any other criminal case. If 
the victim is not sent for medical examination on time, or if the evidence 
submitted by the medical officer is not processed and transmitted to the 
appropriate labs by the police, the entire case may become weak and thus 
benefit the perpetrator.12 Section 9 of the Anti-Rape Act has introduced 
the concept of trained special units, SSOIUs, to investigate sexual 
offences more effectively. Because of their special training, SSOIUs can 
reduce the delays during the investigation and considerably raise the 
likelihood of conviction in sexual violence cases, which currently has an 
abysmally low rate.13 U.N. Handbook for Legislation on Violence 
against Women states: 
 
“It is critical to ensure that those mandated to implement legislation 
regarding violence against women, including police, prosecutors and 
judges, have an in-depth understanding of such legislation and are able 
to implement it in an appropriate and gender-sensitive manner. When 
public officials involved in the implementation of the law are not 
comprehensively trained regarding its content, there is a risk that the 
law will not be implemented effectively or uniformly. There have been 
many and varied efforts to train public officials, and/or to include 
capacity-building on violence against women in the official curricula 
for these professions. Such trainings and capacity-building efforts have 
been found to be most effective, and implemented rigorously, when 
they are mandated in law and developed in close collaboration with 
non-governmental organizations. 
 
“There is evidence that specialized units are more responsive and 
effective in dealing with violence against women. Experience has 
shown that the establishment of such units may facilitate the 
development of expertise in this area and may result in an increase in

the number of cases investigated and a better quality and more efficient 
process for the complainant/ survivor.”14 
16. 
 
Every SSOIU is required to have one female police officer as 
a member. This helps the victim feel comparatively comfortable during 
the investigation. The importance of a female officer increases manifold 
in cases involving children. 
17. 
 
The above discussion leads me to an ineluctable conclusion 
that section 9 of the Anti-Rape Act is mandatory. Section 9 confers 
special jurisdiction on SSOIUs in respect of Scheduled Offences. For this 
purpose, it mandates the Federal Government to establish SSIOUs for the 
Islamabad Capital Territory and the Provincial Governments in every 
district. 
18. 
 
During the hearing of this case, it was mentioned that the 
Punjab Government had not established SSIUOs in several districts even 
two years after the enactment of the Anti-Rape Act. If that is the situation, 
it is directed to constitute the requisite SSOIUs immediately and to 
arrange necessary training for the police officers assigned to them as 
required by law. 
The case at hand 
19. 
 
The District Police Officer Sialkot (Respondent No.2) has 
submitted a report that SSOIUs and Gender Crime Cells comprising 
female SIs/ASIs, who received training regarding sexual offences and 
gender crimes have been established in the Sialkot District under the 
supervision of the Sub-Divisional Police Officer. The S.P. Investigation is 
the overall in-charge of the Wing. The present case is being investigated 
by an SSOIU consisting of the following: (i) Abdul Hameed Virk 
DSP/SDPO Daska, (ii) Shahid Iqbal S.I./SHO, Police Station Saddar 
Daska, (iii) Samra Yousaf S.I., Police Station Saddar Daska. Respondent 
No.2 has categorically stated that the investigation of this case is 
compliant with section 9 of the Anti-Rape Act.
