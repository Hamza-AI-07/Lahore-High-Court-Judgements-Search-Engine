09.05.2024 Mr. Mahmood Ahmad Bhatti, Advocate for the 
appellants. 
 
 
 
 
This Intra Court Appeal has been filed against 
the order dated 03.05.2024, passed by the learned Single 
Judge in Chambers in the Writ Petition No.3214 of 
2024, whereby the Petition filed by the appellants under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 was dismissed. 
2. 
   The brief facts, necessary for the disposal of the 
instant appeal are that pursuant to the Recruitment 
Policy 2022,the Chief Executive Officer, Bahawalpur 
Health Authority (the Respondent No.2) advertised the 
posts of BS04 within the Bahawalpur Health Authority 
and amongst others the appellants qualified for the 
subject matter posts and through letters dated 

              Intra Court Appeal No.57 of 2024 
 
 
2 
 
 
02.01.2023 were issued Job Offer Letters for the said 
posts however in terms of Clause 5 of the Job Offer 
Letters , upon the completion of the initial contract 
period of one year, the contracts of the appellants were 
accordingly, not extended and the appellants filed the 
Writ Petition No.3214 of 2024 under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
assailing the said termination of their contracts, 
however, the learned Single Judge in Chambers vide the 
order dated 03.05.2024 dismissed the petition as filed 
by the appellants, hence, the appeal.  
3. 
The learned counsel for the appellants submitted 
that the learned Single Judge in Chambers had erred in 
facts and law while passing the order dated 03.05.2024. 
The learned counsel for the appellants further argued 
that the appellants while serving as driver,in the case of 
the appellant namely Ahsan Alahi Zaheer and as a 
Security Guard, in the case of the appellant namely 
Muhammad Zohaib ur Rehman, were employed on 
contracts and their contracts were terminated without 
any just and lawful cause. The learned counsel 
submitted that the learned Single Judge in Chambers 
failed to advert that the services of the appellants were 
always satisfactory and the Appointing Authority 
deprived the appellants of their right to the extension of 
their contracts .

4. 
   We have heard the learned counsel for the 
appellants and perused the record. 
5.     The perusal of the record reveals  that pursuant to 
the Recruitment Policy 2022, the Chief Executive 
Officer, 
Bahawalpur 
Health 
Authority 
(the 
Respondent No.2) advertised the posts of BS04 
within the Bahawalpur Health Authority and amongst 
others the appellants qualified for the subject matter 
posts and through letters dated 02.01.2023 were 
issued Job Offer Letters for the said posts. Two 
clauses of the said Job Offer Letters are important to 
evaluate the rights of the appellants: 
“5- Tenure: 
Your appointment will be purely temporary on contract 
basis for a period of one year.However, it will extend on 
satisfactory performance and in the best public interest. 
12- Seniority/regular appointment: 
       Contract appointment will neither confer any 
right for regular appointment to the same post nor the 
service shall be counted towards seniority.” (emphasis 
supplied)  
 
It is an admitted position that the appellants duly 
agreed and accepted the terms and conditions 
contained in the Job Offer Letters . In terms of Clause 
5 of the Job Offer Letters , upon the completion of the 
initial contract period of one year, the contracts of the 
appellants were accordingly, not extended .We are 
afraid that the subject matter extension of contracts 

              Intra Court Appeal No.57 of 2024 
 
 
4 
 
 
cannot be granted to their appellants as of law as well 
as of right, firstly, for the reasons that on the day 
when the appellants invoked the jurisdiction of this 
Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973,their status was of 
employees whose contracts had expired and this 
Court under its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
through a mandatory injunction cannot force an 
unwilling employer to extend the contracts of service 
which has already expired. Secondly, for granting a 
relief canvassed by the appellants in the petition filed  
under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and now in the instant 
Intra Court Appeal this Court cannot undertake a 
factual inquiry. Thirdly, it is not the case of the 
appellants that non-extension of their contracts 
suffers from mala fide in law as neither the Contract 
Policy, 2004 nor the Recruitment Policy 2022 has 
been challenged nor any statutory instrument or order 
has been assailed. The nature of challenge put 
forward by the appellants at maximum can be termed 
as mala fide in fact, which this Court in the exercise 
of its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
cannot entertain, as such kind of allegations require 

              Intra Court Appeal No.57 of 2024 
 
 
5 
 
 
strict factual proof and recording of evidence. It is 
important to note that the employment of appellants 
was contractual in nature and being contractual 
employees, the appellants have no automatic right to 
continue the employment unless same has specifically 
been provided in law. Being contractual employees, 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
appellants 
and 
respondents will be governed by the principle of 
master and servant and the appellants have to serve 
till the satisfaction of their master. Hence, in view of 
the established principle of law that a contract 
employee is debarred from approaching this Court in 
its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution 
of 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Pakistan, 
1973 
for 
reinstatement or extension of a contract and the only 
remedy available to a contract employee is to file suit 
for damages alleging any breach of contract or failure 
to extend the contract, this Court cannot force the 
employer to reinstate or extend the contract of the 
employees, even in case of any wrongful termination. 
Reliance is placed on case reported as "Ministry of 
IPC through Secretary and others v. Arbab Altaf 
Hussain and others" (2014 SCMR 1573) wherein it 
has been held as under:- 
 
"Secondly, the employment(s) of the said 
respondents admittedly was contractual in nature and 
their services were terminated after due notice as per 

              Intra Court Appeal No.57 of 2024 
 
 
6 
 
 
their contractual terms and conditions of service. And 
even on this account the writ petitions were incompetent 
and had to fail.--------So the writ petitions filed by all 
other respondents, as mentioned earlier, were liable to be 
dismissed on these scores."  
Reference may also be made to the case titled as 
"Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Law, 
Justice and Parliamentary Affairs v. Muhammad 
Azam Chattha" (2013 SCMR 120) wherein it has 
been held as under:-  
 
" In addition to it, it is a cardinal principle of law 
that a contract employee instead of pressing for his 
reinstatement to serve for the leftover period can at best 
claim damages to the extent of unexpired period of his 
service. 
  
15. 
In  Halsbury's  Laws  of  England  (3rd Ed.) Vol. 
11, p.244 Para 414, it is stated that the measure of 
damages for wrongful dismissal, is the loss thereby 
incurred, and that would, subject to the duty of the 
plaintiff to mitigate, normally be the wages due and 
payable for the agreed period of service. In the case of 
Federation of Pakistan v. Ali Ahmed Qureshi (2001 
SCMR 1733) it has been held that in view of the doctrine 
of master and servant, the contract of service cannot be 
specifically enforced, however, in the event of arbitrary 
dismissal or unwarranted termination of employment, an 
employee is entitled to sue for damages equal to wages, 
allowances and other benefits, which would have been 
otherwise due and payable under the contract of 
employment. In the case of Pakistan Red Crescent Society 
and another v. Syed Nazir Gillani  (PLD  2005  SC  806)  
it  has  been  held  that  an  employee  of a  corporation,  in  
the  absence  of  violation  of  law  or  any  statutory rule,  
cannot  press  into  service  the  Constitutional  or  civil  
jurisdiction for seeking relief of reinstatement in service 
and can only claim damages against his wrongful 
dismissal or termination. While holding so, reference has 
been made to the cases of Mrs. M.N. Arshad v. Mrs. 
Naeema Khan (PLD 1990 SC 612), Messrs Malik and Haq 
v. Muhammad Shamsul Islam Chowdhury (PLD 1961 SC 
531), Zainul Abidin v. Multan Central Cooperative Bank 
Limited (PLD 1966 SC 445), Chairman, East Pakistan 
Industrial Development Corporation v. Rustom Ali (PLD 
1966 SC 848), Abdul Salam Mehta v. Chairman, WAPDA

(1970 SCMR 40), Lt. Col. Shujauddin Ahmad v. Oil and 
Gas Development Corporation (1971 SCMR 566), R.T.A. 
Janjua v. National Shipping Corporation (PLD 1974 SC 
146), Principal, Cadet College, Kohat v. Muhammad 
Shoab Qureshi (PLD 1984 SC 1791), Anwar Hussain v. 
Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (PLD 1984 
SC 194), Syed Akbar Ali Bokhari v. State Bank of 
Pakistan (PLD 1977 Lah. 234), Muhammad Yusuf Shah v. 
Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PLD 1981 SC 
224) and Evacuee Trust Property Board v. Muhammad 
Nawaz (1983 SCMR 1275). The same principle has been 
reiterated in the case of Brig. (R.) Sakhi Marjan v. 
Managing Director PEPCO (2009 SCMR 708). Reference 
may also be made to the case of S. S. Shetty v. Bharat 
Nidhi, Ltd. (AIR 1958 SC 12) wherein the Indian Supreme 
Court on the same issue has held as under:-- 
 
"The position as it obtains in the ordinary law of 
master and servant is quite clear. The master who 
wrongfully dismisses his servant is bound to pay him such 
damages as will compensate him for the wrong that he has 
sustained. "They are to be assessed by reference to the 
amount earned in the service wrongfully terminated and 
the time likely to elapse before the servant obtains another 
post for which he is fitted. If the contract expressly 
provides that it is terminable upon, e.g., a month's notice, 
the damages will ordinarily be a month's wages. ... No 
compensation can be claimed in respect of the injury done 
to the servant's feeling by the circumstances of his 
dismissal, nor in respect of extra difficulty of finding work 
resulting from those circumstances. A servant who has 
been wrongfully dismissed must use diligence to seek 
another employment, and the fact that he has been offered 
a suitable post may be taken into account in assessing the 
damages." [Chitty on Contracts, 21st Ed., Vol. (2), p.559 
para. 1040]. 
 
If the contract of employment is for a specific term, 
the servant would in that event be entitled to damages the 
amount of which would be measured prima facie and 
subject to the rule of maitigation in the salary of which the 
master had deprived him. [Vide Collier v. Sunday Referee 
Publishing Co., Ltd. (1940) 4 All E.R. 237]. The servant 
would then be entitled to the whole of the salary, benefits, 
etc., which he would have earned had he continued in the 
employ of the master for the full term of the contract, 
subject of course to mitigation of damages by way of 
seeking alternative employment. Such damages would be 
recoverable by the servant for his wrongful dismissal by 
the master only on the basis of the master having 
committed a breach of the contract of employment." 
The ratio decidendi laid down by the Hon'ble apex 
Court in the judgments mentioned supra has 
further been ratified in judgments reported as 
Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Workers

Welfare Board through Chairman v. Raheel Ali 
Gohar and others (2021 PLC (C.S.) 125), Miss 
Naureen Naz Butt v. Pakistan International 
Airlines through Chairman, PIA and others (2020 
SCMR 1625) and Qazi Munir Ahmed v. 
Rawalpindi Medical College and Allied Hospital 
through Principal and others (2019 SCMR 648). 
Even otherwise, in view of the availability of an 
alternate 
efficacious 
remedy/claim 
of 
damages/compensation, if any, to the appellants  
under the law, the jurisdiction of this Court under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973 is also barred. Reliance can be 
placed 
on 
Indus 
Trading 
and 
Contracting 
Company v. Collector of Customs (Preventive) 
Karachi and others (2016 SCMR 842), Dr. Sher 
Afgan Khan Niazi v. Ali S. Habib and others (2011 
SCMR 1813) and Muhammad Abbasi v. S.H.O. 
Bhara Kahu and 7 others (PLD 2010 SC 969). 
The learned counsel for the appellants has been 
unable to point out any illegality or excess of 
jurisdiction having been committed by the learned 
Single Judge in Chambers while passing the 
impugned order dated 03.05.2024. We find that the 
impugned order dated 03.05.2024 has been passed 
by the learned Single Judge in Chambers after going 

              Intra Court Appeal No.57 of 2024

through the record of the case and taking into 
consideration the facts and circumstances of the 
case.  
6.      
In view of the above discussion, this appeal 
being devoid of merit, is dismissed in limine.
