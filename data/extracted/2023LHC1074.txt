Mr. Raza Imtiaz Siddiqui, Advocate for the Petitioners 
alongwith Miss Sibgha Saqib and Barrister Fasih-ur-
Rehman, Advocates. 
Mr. Muhammad Yahya Johar, ASC/Legal Advisor for 
the Respondent-FBR. 
Mr. Nasir Javaid Ghumman, Deputy Attorney General. 
 
 
Through this constitutional petition under Article 199 
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(the “Constitution”), the Petitioners have impugned show 
cause notice dated 02.07.2021 and subsequent notice dated 
16.08.2021 issued by Respondent No.4 under Section 11(2) 
of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (the “1990 Act”). 
2. 
Mr. Raza Imtiaz Siddiqui, Advocate stated that the 
issue in this case relates to adjustment of input tax by the 
Respondents in terms of the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 
of 1990 Act pursuant to the judgment passed by a learned 
Division Bench of this Court in the case of Nishat Mills 
Limited versus Federation of Pakistan etc. (2020 PTD 
1641), in which the Assessing/Adjudicating Officer was 
directed to interpret Section 8(1)(h) and (i) of 1990 Act on 
case to case basis after determining facts of each case 
without prejudice to the findings in this regard. He 
contended that pursuant to the aforesaid judgment of the 
learned Division Bench, the Respondents have proceeded 
with the matter but wrongly interpreted relevant provisions 
of 1990 Act, while dealing with the Petitioners’ claim of 

2 
W.P.No.52043/2021 
input sales tax on supply of the equipment to their other 
plant and decided the case against them twice. He explained 
that the Respondents are now bent upon to decide the issue 
in hand without following proper procedure provided under 
1990 Act by issuing the impugned show cause notice and 
subsequent notice. He next argued that in the judgment 
passed in Nishat Mills Limited Case (supra), learned 
Division Bench of this Court has interpreted provisions of 
Section 8 of 1990 Act and enunciated certain principles 
with regard to adjustment of the input tax by relying on the 
earlier judgment reported as Coca-Cola Beverages Pakistan 
Ltd. versus Customs, Excise and Sales Tax Appellate 
Tribunal and others (2017 PTD 2380) against which leave 
was also granted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in Civil Petitions No.3222-L to 3227-L of 2017, vide order 
dated 11.12.2018. Mr. Raza Imtiaz Siddiqui, Advocate 
maintained that the issue of input tax has been dealt with in 
detail by learned Division Bench of this Court in 
Paragraph-5 of the supra judgment, the relevant portion of 
which is reproduced hereunder for ready reference:- 
“We have examined the provisions of Sections 7 & 8 
of the Act of 1990. Collective and plain reading of 
both the Sections (ignoring intermediary phrases 
imposing conditions of qualifying these provisions) 
shows that Section 7 is ‘entitling a registered person 
to deduct (adjust) input tax, for the purpose of 
taxable supplies, from the output tax’. The 
entitlement, to deduct/adjust input tax, is subject to 
the “purpose of taxable supplies”. Conversely, 
Section 8 is disentitling reclaim or deductions of 
input tax paid on the goods used for a purpose other 
than taxable supplies. The deduced basic principle is 
that input tax paid on goods can be deducted or 
reclaimed, “only if, such goods are used for the 
purpose of taxable supplies.” 
 
He strenuously stated that the Respondents are not 
complying with the directions/observations given by the 
learned Division Bench of this Court in the afore-quoted 

3 
W.P.No.52043/2021 
paragraph, thus, violating the provisions of Article 201 of 
the Constitution, which clearly states that any decision of a 
High Court shall, to the extent that it decides a question of 
law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law, be 
binding on all Courts subordinate to it as well as 
governmental authorities but in this case, the principles 
settled by the learned Division Bench of this Court in the 
judgment, cited above, are not being followed by the 
Respondents in stricto sensu.  
3. 
Mr. Muhammad Yahya Johar, ASC has objected to 
maintainability of this petition by submitting that claim of 
the Petitioners regarding adjustment of input tax, is not 
justified being barred in terms of Section 8(1)(h) of 1990 
Act, therefore, the same cannot be allowed. 
4. 
In rebuttal, Mr. Raza Imtiaz Siddiqui, Advocate 
contended that neither the Petitioners are contributing to the 
taxable supply nor they have any nexus with the taxable 
supply, therefore, they are entitled to the relief sought for. 
He explained that prior to the issuance of show-cause notice 
the Petitioners had been requesting the Respondents to visit 
the site in actual to see pipes, etc. which have been used in 
expansion of plant. He placed on record the Annual Report 
2019 showing the Plant Capacity and Actual Production by 
stating that after such expansion the production has been 
massively increased. Relevant part of the report is as 
under:-

W.P.No.52043/2021 
However, he while confining his arguments to the extent of 
prayer clause (iv) of this petition, next argued that 
Petitioner No.1 has already requested Respondent No.4, 
vide letter dated 25.08.2021, to carry out an on-site/physical 
verification to determine whether the items, on which input 
tax has been claimed by Petitioner No.1, has been done in 
accordance with law or not, therefore, the Petitioners will 
be satisfied if a specific direction be issued to the said 
Respondent in this regard because Article 10-A of the 
Constitution provides right of fair trial and due process to 
all citizens in determination of their rights and obligations 
while under Article 4 of the Constitution it is an inalienable 
right of the citizens to be treated in accordance with law. 
5. 
Arguments have been heard and record perused. 
6. 
If a quick glance is taken on provisions of Section 8 
of 1990 Act, it will manifest that the exclusion of 
adjustment/refund of input tax does not have a nexus with 
the taxable activity/supply of the registered person and 
parameters regarding adjustment of input tax are given in 
Sub-Sections (a) to (m) of this Section. The mechanism 
provided in Section 8 will be read together with the 
provisions contained in Sections 2 and 7 of 1990 Act when 
such kind of exercise regarding input tax is carried out by 
the competent authority. During the course of arguments, 
learned counsel for the Petitioners has also referred to the 
Doctrine of Textualism developed in the case of Reliance 
Commodities (Private) Ltd. versus Federation of Pakistan 
and others (PLD 2020 Lahore 632)=(2020 PTD 1464) in 
which this Court has vastly discussed scope of the Doctrine 
of Textualism by relying on the quote of a Judge of US 
Supreme Court, Justice Antonin Scalia, who discussed 
responsibilities of judges in interpreting the statutes and the 
regulations by holding as under:- 

5 
W.P.No.52043/2021 
“In exploring the neglected art of statutory 
interpretation, the judges resist the temptation to use 
legislative intention and legislative history. Hence, it 
is incompatible with democratic government to allow 
the meaning of a statute to be determined by what  
the judges think the law givers meant rather than    
by what the legislature actually promulgated. 
Eschewing the judicial lawmaking that is the essence 
of common law, judges should interpret statutes and 
regulations by focusing on the text itself.” 
 
In the present case, according to Mr. Raza Imtiaz Siddiqui, 
Advocate, Sections 2, 7 and 8 of 1990 Act are to be read 
together in totality because they are intertwined. Section 2 
pertains to definition clauses; Section 7 defines the word 
‘distributor’ whereas Section 8 of 1990 Act describes the 
scheme of law relating to the tax credit which is not 
allowed. He contended that the question whether general 
principles set to evaluate and interpret a Statute and more 
importantly, the concept of holistic examination of any law 
as opposed to singular picking and choosing certain 
sections/provisions of the law whilst ignoring others, being 
intertwined with one another, cannot be read in isolation 
and this Court has already developed the Doctrine of 
Intertwined in the case of Tariq Iqbal Malik versus M/s 
Multiplierz Group Pvt. Ltd. and 04 others (2022 CLD  
468). 
7. 
Moreover, the scope of impermissibility concerning 
to the adjustment of input tax with reference to the scope of 
the word “purpose” and/or “direct use” in production or 
manufacture of taxable goods/supplies has already been 
distinguished by a learned Division Bench of this Court in 
the judgment reported as Coca-Cola Beverages Pakistan 
Ltd. versus Customs, Excise and Sales Tax Appellate 
Tribunal and others (2017 PTD 2380). The only point 
involved in the matter is whether the inputs have been 
utilized for the purpose of taxable supplies or not and stance 

6 
W.P.No.52043/2021 
of the Petitioners is that the items, on which input tax has 
been claimed by them, can only be used or have been used 
for the industrial establishment of the Petitioner No.1/DG 
Khan Cement Company Limited, therefore, they are fully 
entitled 
for 
adjustment 
of 
the 
input 
tax. 
The 
Respondent/Federal Board of Revenue (the “FBR”) 
functions under the Federal Board of Revenue Act, 2007 
(the “2007 Act”) and in terms of Section 4(1) (a) and (k) of 
this Act, it has to act in implementing the provisions of all 
fiscal laws, by (i) taking appropriate action; (ii) making 
policy; and (iii) issuing rules & regulations or guidelines in 
a clear, transparent, effective and expedient manner. In the 
cases of Chenab Flour and General Mills etc. versus 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Revenue Division 
etc. (PLD 2021 Lahore 343) and Ramzan Sugar Mills 
Limited versus Federal Board of Revenue and others (2021 
PTD 1321) this Court has already declared the FBR as a 
Regulatory Body to deal with all the tax related affairs 
under relevant provisions of the 2007 Act by holding as 
under:-  
“the FBR is Regulator of all fiscal laws in the 
country and being a Regulator, it vests with the main 
goal of tax collection in the country”, therefore, the 
matter of seeking record and information under 
various Sub-Sections of Section 122 of the 
Ordinance, comes within the domain of the FBR as 
well as the government officers appointed under the 
Income Tax Ordinance and such matters need no 
interference by this Court as required under its 
constitutional jurisdiction.” 
 
8. 
It is noted that the Petitioner in response to show 
cause notice dated 02.07.2021 has specifically made request 
on 25.08.2021 to the Respondents to visit manufacturing 
unit by deputing a team but this exercise has not been done 
so far. While the Respondents in report and parawise 
comments stated that they had already requested the 

7 
W.P.No.52043/2021 
Petitioner to provide relevant record but the same has not 
been done except partial compliance of the order passed in 
I.C.A.No.72329 of 2019.  
9. 
On 27.10.2021 Dr. Ishtiaq A. Khan, Commissioner 
Inland Revenue, Lahore appeared and was confronted 
whether prayer clause (iv) alongwith reply submitted by the 
Petitioner on 25.08.2021 has been taken into consideration 
before filing of this writ petition, he stated that this 
controversy could be resolved if the matter be referred to 
the concerned respondent to that extent. It is mattering to 
note here that the issue whether the inputs have been 
utilized for the purpose of taxable supplies or not, can only 
be conveniently resolved if an on-site/physical verification 
of the utilized inputs of Petitioner No.1 is made, which is 
also the statutory mandate of 1990 Act, and even otherwise 
there is no harm in law if such exercise is done for the 
entire satisfaction of both the Petitioner and the revenue 
hierarchy, before a final decision is rendered in the matter.  
10. 
In view of the above provisions of the “Act”, the case 
law relied by the parties and especially prayer (iv) made by 
the Petitioner, let a certified copy of this petition alongwith 
all the annexures be sent to the Respondent No.4 to decide 
the matter regarding constitution of a team of the 
qualified/expert persons to attain an on-site/physical 
verification clarifying the fact whether the items, on which 
input tax has been claimed by Petitioner No.1, has been 
done strictly as per provisions of 1990 Act or not. The said 
team then, if made, will visit the manufacturing premises of 
Petitioner No.1 in order to verify each and every invoice 
under the relevant heading so as to conclude whether the 
goods thereunder have been used for the purpose of taxable 
activity or making of taxable supply and after completion of 
the said exercise, the matter will be finally adjudicated by 

8 
W.P.No.52043/2021 
the adjudicating authority after taking into consideration the 
legal points, relevant provisions of 1990 Act and the 2007 
Act or any other law applicable thereto as well as the 
judgments mentioned above [specifically the judgment 
passed in Nishat Mills Limited Case (supra)], within the 
prescribed period provided under the law. 
 
Disposed of accordingly.
