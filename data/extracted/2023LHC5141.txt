MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. The matter under consideration 
has a chequered history, which starts with the allotment of property 
No.B.2(b) Liaquat Market, Iqbal Road, Rawalpindi (hereinafter 
referred to as “subject property”) to the predecessors-in-interest of 
the petitioners namely Raja Ali Zaman and Raja Muhammad 
Banaras jointly on 16th May, 1964. As per claim of the petitioners, 
“subject property” was originally in dilapidated condition and 
following the allotment, their predecessors-in-interest reconstructed 
ground floor in the year 1972 after getting permission from the 
respondent-department and the approval of the building plan from 

Writ Petition No.2826-R of 2022 
-2- 
 
the erstwhile Municipal Corporation, Rawalpindi. It is claim of the 
petitioners that respondent-department then sold out the “subject 
property” through registered sale deed to their predecessors-in-
interest on 06th June, 1992 with the permission of the Federal 
Government through letter No.5(20)/77/ETP dated 26th February, 
1992. After the execution of sale deed the predecessors-in-interest 
of the petitioners constructed first and second floor consisting of 
shops, stores and twelve wash rooms, after getting building plan 
approved from the erstwhile Municipal Corporation, Rawalpindi. It 
is asserted that the sale deed was called in question by the 
respondent-department through a suit before the Civil Court, which 
was initially dismissed by the trial court as well as the appellate 
court, however, in Civil Revision No.373 of 2008 filed by the 
respondent-department judgments of both the courts were reversed 
by way of judgment dated 18th January, 2022. The petitioners being 
aggrieved filed Civil Appeal No.668 of 2022 before the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, which too was dismissed by way of judgment 
dated 04th August, 2022. The petitioners then filed a Civil Review 
Petition No.588 of 2022, which has been dismissed during the 
pendency of this petition by way of order dated 06th July, 2023. The 
grievance of the petitioners is that the respondent-department 
without any lawful authority, jurisdiction and without notice sealed 
the “subject property” and started entering into lease agreements 
with their tenants, which act is illegal and not operative upon their 
rights.  
2. 
On this petition notice was issued to the respondent-
department by way of order dated 10th October, 2022 and report 
and parawise comments was requisitioned. In its report respondent 
No.1 stated that the “subject property” vests in the Evacuee Trust 
Property Board in terms of the Evacuee Trust Properties 
(Management and Disposal) Act, 1975 (hereinafter referred to as 
“Act, 1975”). It is also mentioned in the report that one Ali Zaman 
predecessor-in-interest of petitioners No.1 to 3 was previously 
occupying the “subject property” as tenant but he succeeded in 
preparing a forged sale deed No.2477 dated 06th June, 1992, which 

Writ Petition No.2826-R of 2022 
-3- 
 
was questioned through a civil suit and suit was ultimately decreed 
in revision petition before this Court. The petition is resisted by the 
respondent-department on multiple grounds. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that suit 
instituted by the respondent-department was consisting of multiple 
reliefs. He added that though suit was ultimately decreed but decree 
was never put to execution process. Learned counsel emphasized 
that once the respondent-department opted to invoke the 
jurisdiction of Civil Court and succeeded in obtaining a decree it 
cannot then advert to the provisions of the “Act, 1975”. It is argued 
with vehemence that since decree was not put to execution in terms 
of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908), so the 
respondent-department is precluded either to take over the 
possession from the petitioners or to seal the “subject property”. 
Learned counsel submitted that respondent-department is debarred 
from taking any punitive action by invoking the provisions of the 
“Act, 1975” on account of doctrine of election. In support of his 
contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on 
TRADING 
CORPORATION OF PAKISTAN versus DEVAN SUGAR MILLS LIMITED 
and others (PLD 2018 Supreme Court 828), LIAQAT ALI KHAN and 10 
others 
versus 
CHIEF 
SETTLEMENT 
COMMISSIONER, 
MEMBER 
(JUDICIAL-V) and 6 others (2021 YLR 349) and IRFAN ULLAH KHAN 
versus PROVINCE OF THE PUNJAB and others (2020 CLC 594). 
4. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer submitted that after passing 
of the decree in favour of the respondent-department, which 
attained finality with the dismissal of review petition, the 
petitioners have left with no right whatsoever in the “subject 
property”. It is contended that “subject property” is an evacuee 
property and the department is vested with the authority to proceed 
against the petitioners under Section 25 of the “Act, 1975”. Learned 
Law Officer while making reference to the scheme for the 
Management and Disposal of Urban Evacuee Trust Properties, 
1977 submitted that no right is left with the petitioners even qua the 
superstructure raised on the “subject property”.

5. 
Learned Legal Advisor while adopting the arguments of 
learned Law Officer added that the petition is tainted with mala-
fide and the petitioners are lingering on their unauthorized 
possession without any lawful authority. Reliance is placed on ATIF 
RIAZ versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary Ministry of 
Religious Affairs, Islamabad and 6 others (PLD 2023 Lahore 536). 
6. 
Heard. Record perused. 
7. 
The “subject property” was owned by the Evacuee Trust 
Property Board, which was initially rented out to Raja Ali Zaman 
and Raja Muhammad Banaras, predecessors-in-interest of the 
petitioners by the Deputy Commissioner/Chairman defunct 
Evacuee Trust Committee vide order dated 16th May, 1964. During 
the subsistence of tenancy, the predecessors-in-interest of the 
petitioners approached the then Federal Minister for social welfare 
and rural development and solicited outright sale of the “subject 
property” in their favour. The Federal Minister assented to the 
request and accorded approval for sale of the suit land vide 
memorandum dated 22nd March, 1977. The Federal Government 
was when made aware of the said memorandum, it issued another 
memorandum dated 13th May, 1977 and restrained the Evacuee 
Trust Property Board from finalizing the deal. The matter though 
came to an end but the Deputy Administrator Evacuee Trust 
Property Board, Rawalpindi executed a sale deed on 06th January, 
1992 in favour of the predecessors-in-interest of the petitioners. 
Being aggrieved the respondent-department instituted a suit for 
declaration and cancellation of sale deed, permanent and mandatory 
injunction. Suit was initially dismissed by the trial court vide 
judgment and decree dated 08th January, 2002, which was though 
questioned in appeal before the learned Additional District Judge, 
Rawalpindi but appeal too was dismissed vide judgment and decree 
dated 17th January, 2008. It would not be out of place to mention 
here that accompanied cross objections on behalf of the petitioners 
with regard to findings on issue No.1 were allowed. The 
respondent-department then assailed the findings of the courts 

Writ Petition No.2826-R of 2022 
-5- 
 
below before this Court in Civil Revision No.373 of 2008, which 
was accepted by way of judgment dated 18th January, 2022 and suit 
was decreed as prayed for. The petitioners being dissatisfied from 
the said judgment filed Civil Appeal No.668 of 2022 before the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan but same was dismissed through 
judgment dated 04th August, 2022. The petitioners then filed Civil 
Review Petition No.588 of 2022, which was dismissed by way of 
order dated 06th July, 2023 i.e. during pendency of this petition. 
This makes the matter relating to the status of the property and 
rights of the parties appertaining thereto very clear and simple. In 
short it can be observed without even a hint of doubt that the 
“subject property” vests in the Evacuee Trust Property Board and 
the petitioners have left with no right whatsoever to claim qua the 
“subject property”.  
POINT FOR DETERMINATION 
8. 
In the wake of above discussion, the sole point which 
requires determination of this Court is as to “whether the 
respondent-department can resort to the provisions of the 
“Act, 1975” instead of invoking the provisions of Order XXI 
of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter 
referred to as “C.P.C.”)?” 
9. 
“Act, 1975” was promulgated to provide for the management 
and disposal of evacuee properties attached to charitable, religious 
or educational trusts or institutions. Section 2(d) of the “Act, 1975” 
defines “evacuee trust property” as under :- 
“(d) 
“Evacuee trust property” means evacuee trust properties 
attached to charitable, religious or educational trusts or 
institutions or any other properties which form part of the Trust 
Pool constituted under this Act.”  
In terms of Section 6 of the “Act, 1975” evacuee trust property 
shall vest with the Federal Government. As already observed that 
“subject property” was an evacuee trust property, however, it was 
sold out to the predecessors-in-interest of the petitioners on the 
recommendations of the Federal Minister but without approval 
from the competent authority. Sale was challenged through suit 

Writ Petition No.2826-R of 2022 
-6- 
 
which was though initially dismissed but in revisional jurisdiction 
this Court by way of judgment dated 18th January, 2022, while 
setting aside the concurrent findings of the courts below decreed 
the suit as prayed for. The petitioners though challenged the 
judgment before the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Civil Appeal 
No.668 of 2022 but remained unsuccessful. The relevant extract 
from the same is reproduced below :- 
“13. 
On being confronted with the question as to whether 
ETPB’s board had ever moved a resolution to the effect that 
the suit property is to be sold to the Appellants, the Learned 
Counsel for the Appellants was unable to point out any 
document which could reasonably lead us to conclude the 
existence of such a resolution. Even otherwise, no resolution 
from the ETPB’s Board sanctioning sale of the suit property to 
the Appellants was ever placed on record. There is also nothing 
on the record to suggest that the concerned Minister had ever 
directed the ETPB’s board to deliberate on the matter and pass 
a resolution concerning the sale of the suit property to the 
Appellants. If there was never any resolution, then there was 
never any sanction of the sale either. If there was never any 
sanction, then there could have been no approval from the 
Federal Government for sale of the suit property. If there was 
never any approval from the Federal Government, then the Sale 
Deed itself would be illegal as well as ineffective owing to the 
reason that in light of Article 173 of the Constitution, the 
President would not be deemed to have accorded approval for 
the sale of the suit property through the Federal Government. 
The High Court had therefore rightly concluded that being 
bereft of its executive nature, the Sale Deed had been obtained 
without the approval of the Federal Government and was 
therefore illegal and void-ab-initio.” 
Civil Review Petition No.588 of 2022 filed by the petitioners was 
also dismissed by way of order dated 06th July, 2023. Since sale in 
favour of the predecessors-in-interest of the petitioners was void 
ab-initio, so status of the “subject property” remained as an evacuee 
property right from the first day and it has never lost the 
characteristic of evacuee property for a single moment.  
10. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that in ordinary course a 
decree holder can only get the fruits of the decree by putting it to 
the test of execution in terms of Order XXI of “C.P.C.” but on 
account of nature of the property being evacuee it always would 
remain a subject of the “Act, 1975”. Section 25 of the “Act, 1975” 
authorizes the Chairman, Administrator, Deputy Administrator and 
Assistant Commissioner to eject any person in possession or 

Writ Petition No.2826-R of 2022 
-7- 
 
occupation of any evacuee trust property whose possession or 
occupation is unauthorized. Section 31 of the Act ibid provides an 
overriding effect to the “Act, 1975”. Needless to reiterate that when 
once it is declared by the court of competent jurisdiction that the 
“subject property” is an evacuee property and the sale in favour of 
the predecessors-in-interest of the petitioners was void ab-initio, 
status of the petitioners being successors-in-interest of the 
purported vendees becomes that of illegal occupant and trespassers, 
paving way for respondent-department to invoke the penal 
provisions of the “Act, 1975”.  
11. 
So far contention of learned counsel for the petitioners that 
the respondent-department is precluded to invoke the provisions of 
the “Act, 1975” on the basis of doctrine of election as is elaborated 
in the Trading Corporation of Pakistan’s case supra. It is observed 
that though a civil suit was instituted by the respondent-department 
seeking annulment of the sale deed qua “subject property” which 
was ultimately decreed but as the status of the “subject property” 
remained as an evacuee property even with the execution of sale 
deed, so no clog can be imposed upon the respondent-department to 
invoke the provisions of the “Act, 1975”. 
12. 
Adverting to the question as to the effect of decree not put to 
execution process, it is observed without any hint of doubt that 
ownership of a decree holder remained intact even if the decree is 
not put to execution. As already observed that the “subject 
property” is an evacuee property, so it vests with the Federal 
Government as per Section 6 of the “Act, 1975”. While dealing 
with similar proposition in the case of ARSHAD ALI and 3 others versus 
SARTAJ and 8 others (2016 YLR 127) the Division Bench of Peshawar 
High Court observed as under :- 
“6. The only grievance of the petitioners/plaintiffs is that the 
decree dated 20/09/2003 passed in civil suit No.28/1 in favour 
of respondents/defendants Nos.1 and 2 could have been put to 
execution/implementation by respondents/defendants Nos.1 
and 2 within a period of three years, thus the same has lost its 
legal effect and there is no subsisting decree in their favour and 
the said decree in no circumstances could be equated with the 
title decree conferring any title in favour of respondents/ 

Writ Petition No.2826-R of 2022 
-8- 
 
defendants Nos.1 and 2. Since the aforesaid decree has been 
passed just to enforce the agreement to sell earlier executed in 
favour of respondents/ defendants Nos.1 and 2 through 
execution of another registered deed in their favour. Since the 
aforesaid registered deed has not been executed till date in their 
favour, therefore, the respondents Nos.1 and 2 cannot be held 
as owners of the disputed property and until the registered deed 
has not been executed in favour of respondents/ defendants 
Nos.1 and 2 on the strength of court decree dated 20/09/2003, 
the ownership/title shall remain vested in the previous owners 
and the respondents/ defendants cannot claim any title of the 
disputed property. Learned counsel for the petitioners/plaintiffs 
bitterly argued that by passing a prescribed time of six years, 
right conferred on the decree holder, if any, ipso facto stood 
extinguished. The said argument has no force. The decree 
dated 20/09/2003 passed in favour of respondents Nos.1 and 2 
on the basis of compromise and the moment, defendants/ 
judgment debtors in that suit made a consent before the trial 
Court, they have divested of all their rights and liabilities and 
the rights were transferred in favour of the respondents Nos.1 
and 2/decree holders for all purposes. Ownership of the decree-
holder remains intact even if the decree is not put to execution. 
Reference may be made to "Muhammad Latif v. Bashir Ahmad 
and 7 others (2004 CLC 1010). We are also fortified, in our 
view by "Mahboob Khan v. Hassan Khan Durrani" (PLD 1990 
Supreme Court 778). In a case "Sher Muhammad through legal 
heirs v. Member (Judicial) Board of Revenue and 4 others 
(2010 MLD 187), it was also held, "Such decree was not 
required to be put to execution----ownership of decree-holder 
would remain intact even if such decree was not put to 
execution". In another case "Mst. Hussain Bibi v. Siraj Din" 
(PLD 1998 Lahore 548) it has been held that, "Limitation Act 
merely bars the remedy or assistance of Court for execution of 
the decree but does not extinguish the right or title based on 
the decree" 
In the case of ANJUM and 2 others versus Mst. SUFAIDAN and 3 others 
(PLD 1989 Lahore 103) this Court laid down the following 
principles:- 
“Two points arise for consideration. First is in regard to 
possession of the plaintiff and second as to the effect of 
non-execution of decree passed in favour of the plaintiff on 
18-1-1961. Plaintiff gave oral evidence to support her 
possession over the land-in-dispute. She also gave evidence 
that some portion of the land which was under mortgage was 
got redeemed by her and that the tenants paid her the rent in 
respect of the land comprised in their tenancies. In defence, 
Adam defendant No.2 appeared as D.W-1 and deposed that 
possession of the land was with the mortgagee but admitted 
that defendants were not in possession of the land-in-dispute. 
Upon oral evidence and the entries existing in the revenue 
records, possession of the plaintiff over the land-in-dispute was 
established beyond dispute. Solitary statement of the defendant 
was insufficient to discredit the overwhelming evidence 
existing on the plaintiff's side. It is not denied that in the earlier 
round of litigation, her title to the land-in-dispute was 

Writ Petition No.2826-R of 2022 
-9- 
 
acknowledged by the Courts and she was found entitled to 
recover possession of the land in accordance with her 
entitlement. In Mt. Indar Devi v. Kirpa Ram and another AIR 
1930 Lah. 803, it was observed that if a party in whose favour 
a decree for possession was passed went into possession 
without intervention of the Court, its possession would be 
ascribed to the decree. It is well-settled that if a party is in 
possession of the property, execution of the decree was not 
required at all and the decree though not executed yet was alive 
and effective qua the rights acknowledged by it. Limitation 
bars only the remedy and does not extinguish the right itself 
unless the case is covered by section 28 of Limitation Act, 
1908. A person in possession of the property, has obviously no 
need to sue execution for possession thereof. Land-indispute is 
comprised in numerous Khasra numbers. Of it, part is in 
possession of the plaintiff and the rest is shown to be in 
possession of other recorded co-owners. Defendants are not in 
possession. Plaintiff is a co-sharer and even if she is found to 
be in possession of land less than her entitlement in the joint 
Khata, her right to the property cannot extinguish because the 
possession of a co-owner is, in law, the possession of all the 
co-owners. Their rights cannot be extinguished by reason of the 
possession of the co-owner unless there is exclusion of the 
other co-owners for the statutory period. No such exclusion is 
established in the case. Upon the existing records, petitioners 
had no right to deny the entitlement of the plaintiff and cause 
interference with her possession over the land-in-dispute. No 
case for interference has been made out. Second appeal is 
properly concluded by findings of the Courts below. In result, 
appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.” 
To the above effect reference can also be made to Mst. HUSSAIN BIBI 
versus SIRAJ DIN (PLD 1998 Lahore 548) wherein it is held as under :- 
“6. There is considerable force in the arguments raised by the 
respondent's learned counsel. The pre-emption decree was 
passed in favour of the respondent on 25-2-1974 in the 
presence of the petitioner's learned counsel. On-that date the 
petitioner's evidence was closed under Order XVII, rule 3, 
C.P.C. because she had failed to produce her evidence. She was 
aware of the decree but did not challenge it in the higher legal 
forum. Therefore, the decree attained finality and the 
respondent became lawful owner of the disputed land. 
Thereafter, the respondent became entitled to claim physical 
possession of the land. The respondent approached the Court 
for execution of the decree on 21-6-1982 which was rightly 
dismissed as being time-barred on 26-3-1986. Prior to that the 
respondent had also filed a suit for recovery of mesne profits 
on 17-12-1983. The proposition of law is well settled that the 
Limitation Act merely bars the remedy or assistance of Court 
for execution of the decree but does not extinguish the right or 
title based on the decree. In the Full Bench judgment of 
Allahabad High Court in the case of Ram Karan Singh and 
another, it was held that the Limitation Act did not necessarily 
extinguish the right, though it certainly placed a bar against the 
remedy by suit; that in certain cases it provided creation of 

Writ Petition No.2826-R of 2022 
-10- 
 
rights by prescription and the corresponding extinction of 
rights (under section 28 of the Limitation Act). In the case of 
Bala Kushaba, it was held that where right to property had been 
established by a decree for possession the barring of the right 
of execution did not extinguish the right and only the remedy 
had become barred. In the case of Muhammad Fazal, it was 
held that where an application for execution of decree for 
possession had become barred by limitation, it did not ipso 
facto extinguish right and title of the applicant in respect of the 
property. In the case of Ideal Life Insurance Company Ltd., it 
was held:- 
"Rights and remedies are two different aspects of a case 
and if the remedy is barred the right is not automatically 
extinguished." 
In the case of The District Board, Banaras it was held:- 
"The case is different where immovable property is 
involved and a right to claim possession becomes time-
barred. In that event the title to the property itself is 
extinguished by virtue of section 28 of the Limitation Act. 
But in the case of movable property the right to sue itself is 
extinguished but the title does not cease to exist. In this 
view of the matter it is possible to decree the claim for 
compensation while holding that the claim for declaration 
is time-barred." 
In the case of MUHAMMAD LATIF versus BASHIR AHMED and 7 others 
(2004 CLC 1010) this Court in somewhat similar circumstances held 
as under :- 
“7………. Though executability of the decree in favour of 
respondents Nos. 1 to 7 dated 28-9-1989 was not matter, before 
the two Courts below because it will be decided by the 
Executing Court, before whom the execution petition, if any, 
ultimately comes, yet it is a settled phenomena that rights 
conferred by the decree, not brought for execution, remain 
intact. In this manner, if the decree, dated 28-9-1989 declared 
respondents Nos. 1 to 7 owners of the land in dispute, their 
ownership will not extinct only due to non-execution of the 
said decree……….” 
Guidance in this respect can also be sought from ALI AHMAD AND 
ANOTHER versus MUHAMMAD FAZAL AND ANOTHER (1972 SCMR 322). 
The petitioners thus cannot take refuge under the doctrine of 
election to protect their possession, which is not only unauthorized 
but illegal.  
13. 
It is also one of the contentions of learned counsel for the 
petitioners that the petitioners are entitled for the superstructure 
built upon the “subject property”, suffice to observe that in terms of 
clause 18-A(5) Chapter VI-A of the scheme for the Management 
and Disposal of Urban Evacuee Trust Properties, 1977 structure 

Writ Petition No.2826-R of 2022 
-11- 
 
raised on the evacuee trust property vest in the Board. The 
contention is thus highly misconceived.  
14. 
It appears that the petitioners after being unsuccessful in the 
first round arising from the civil suit has now devised a mechanism 
to protect their illegal and unauthorized possession upon the 
“subject property” by filing this petition. The petitioners have no 
right whatsoever in the “subject property” and filing of this 
constitutional petition is nothing but to thwart and circumvent the 
process of law. The constitutional jurisdiction is not meant to 
provide aid to a party, who is adamant to grab the property of the 
State. On account of unauthorized possession, the petitioners have 
already earned a lot of money through rent received from the 
tenants of the shops constructed on the “subject property”. This 
petition is undoubtedly not only frivolous but vexatious, resultantly 
it is dismissed with costs of Rs.2,00,000/-, which shall be 
deposited with the Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of this Court within 
thirty days, failing which the same shall be recovered from the 
petitioners as arrears of land revenue in accordance with law.
