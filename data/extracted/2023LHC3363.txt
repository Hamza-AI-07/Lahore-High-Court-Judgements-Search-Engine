petitioner. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The petitioner has assailed the orders dated 
18.04.2023 and 27.04.2023 passed by the Judge Family 
Court, Sialkot and Additional District Judge, Sialkot 
respectively whereby decision of complaint under section 
6(5) of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ordinance’) on oath on 
Holy Qur’an was refused and appeal filed there-against 
was dismissed. 
2. 
The factual background of the instant case is that 
Mst. Samina Rani, respondent No.3, moved a complaint 
under section 6(5) of the Ordinance against the petitioner 
for contracting a second marriage without permission of 
the Arbitration Council.  The petitioner was summoned, 
and charge was framed to which he pleaded not guilty 
and claimed to be tried.  During the course of cross-
examination upon the complainant/respondent No.3, a 
question regarding birthplaces of her elder children was 
put to her, in response to which she offered that if the 
accused/petitioner took oath on Holy Qur’an that the two 
children were born at his house, she would withdraw the 
complaint, which was accepted by the accused/petitioner.  
However, the Judge Family Court, Sialkot vide order 
dated 18.04.2023 observed that oath on Holy Qur’an was 

2 
                                    W.P.No.30090 of 2023 
not applicable in criminal proceedings.  Feeling 
aggrieved, the accused/petitioner preferred appeal before 
the Sessions Judge, Sialkot, which was dismissed vide 
order dated 27.04.2023, hence this petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that 
provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, except for 
sections 10 and 11, do not apply to the proceedings 
before the Family Court in respect of Part I of Schedule 
as provided in section 17 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’).  He maintains that 
in Part I of Schedule of the Family Courts Act, 1964, the 
matters have been specified regarding which the Family 
Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate upon and Sr.No.10 of 
the said Schedule mentions ‘any other matter arising out 
of Nikahnama, therefore, complaint under section 6(5) of 
the Ordinance will also be considered a family dispute. 
He adds that due to mutuality of the promise between the 
parties, the party making offer has no right to resile from 
it after the offer is accepted and in the absence of any 
satisfactory or sufficient cause, the Court is obligated to 
implement the agreement and record the statement of the 
party concerned. Reliance has been placed on the case of 
Sajid Mehmood v. Mst. Shazia Azad and others (2023 
SCMR 153).  
 
4. 
Heard.   
5.   
Polygamy is a subject matter covered by section 6 
of the Ordinance. Sub-section (1) of section 6 ibid 
postulates that no man, during the subsistence of an 
existing marriage, shall, except with the previous 
permission in writing of the Arbitration Council, contract 
another marriage, nor shall any such marriage contracted 
without such permission be registered under the 
Ordinance. Sub-section (5) of section 6 of the Ordinance 

3 
                                    W.P.No.30090 of 2023 
stipulates consequences for contracting another marriage 
without the permission of the Arbitration Council in 
terms of making him liable to pay immediately the entire 
amount of the dower, whether prompt or deferred, due to 
existing wife or wives, if not so paid, to be recoverable as 
arrears of land revenue and prescribes it to be an offence 
triable upon complaint and punishable on conviction with 
simple imprisonment which may extend to one year and 
with fine of five hundred thousand rupees.  
6. 
Section 20 of the Act deems the Family Court to 
be the Judicial Magistrate of the first class under the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter referred 
to as the ‘Code’) for taking cognizance and trial of any 
offence, inter alia, under the Ordinance. Cognizance of 
such an offence can be taken on the complaint of the 
Union Council, Arbitration Council or the aggrieved 
party and the Family Court is required to conduct the trial 
of an offence in accordance with the provisions of 
Chapter XXII of the Code relating to summary trials. In 
the case of Muzaffar Nawaz v. Ishrat Batool and another 
(2022 YLR 1920), while quashing trial proceedings 
conducted by the Magistrate, it was held by this Court 
that only the Family Court had the jurisdiction to try a 
complaint under section 6(5) of the Ordinance.  
7. 
Section 17 of the Act curtails applicability of 
provisions of the Oaths Act, 1872, the Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984 and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in 
the following terms:- 
 
(1) Save as otherwise expressly provided by or under 
this Act, the provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 
(P.O. No.10 of 1984), and the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908, except sections 10 and 11, shall not apply to 
proceedings before any Family Court in respect of Part 
I of Schedule.  
(2) Sections 8 to 11 of the Oaths Act, 1872 shall apply 
to all proceedings before the Family Courts.   

4 
                                    W.P.No.30090 of 2023 
 
8. 
It is manifest from perusal of section 17(1) ibid 
that application of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 is 
excluded in respect of proceedings on matters falling in 
Part I of the Schedule to the Act. However, such 
exclusion has no applicability vis-à-vis criminal 
proceedings for the offences specified in Part II of the 
Schedule or section 20 of the Act including the offence 
under section 6(5) of the Ordinance. Therefore, the 
provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 are applicable 
in criminal proceedings before the Family Court.  
9. 
Article 163 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 
governs acceptance or denial of claim on oath, 
application whereof to laws relating to criminal cases has 
been expressly excluded under clause (3) of the said 
Article. This view is also supported by judgments of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Mst.Bashiran 
Bibi v. Nisar Ahmad Khan (PLD 1990 SC 83). 
Additionally, section 8 of the Oaths Act, 1873 specifies 
the power of Court to tender certain oaths and section 9 
of the said Act embodies discretionary power of the 
Court to ask party or witness whether he will make oath 
proposed by the opposite party, while section 10 of the 
same Act outlines the administration of oath if accepted 
and  section 11 of the aforementioned statute outlines 
status of the evidence so given to be conclusive proof of 
the matter as against the person who offered to be bound 
as above. However, in the case of Muhammad Amir 
Malik v. the state (1991 MLD 226), Division Bench of 
this Court held the provisions of section 8 to 11 of the 
Oaths Act 1873 to be not applicable to criminal 
proceedings. 
10.        Reliance of learned counsel for the petitioner on 
the case of Sajid Mehmood (supra) is misconceived 

5 
                                    W.P.No.30090 of 2023 
inasmuch as facts of the aforementioned case are distinct 
and distinguishable since that case involved a civil claim 
for the recovery of dower and dowry articles whereas the 
instant case related to criminal proceedings in a 
complaint for the offence under section 6(5) of the 
Ordinance triable by the Family Court under section 20 
of the Act.     
11. 
 As regards the plea that complaint against the 
petitioner is a matter arising out of Nikahnama between 
the parties in view of item No.10 of Part-I of the 
Schedule to the Act,  the same is clearly misconceived as 
the dispute between the parties is about the second 
marriage of the husband without permission which 
constitutes an offence under section 6(5) of the 
Ordinance for which a punishment has been prescribed. 
Jurisdiction 
of 
the 
Family 
Court 
to 
try 
the 
aforementioned offence is clearly specified in section 20 
of the Act and Part I of the Schedule to the Act is of no 
relevance for that purpose.   
12. 
 
For the foregoing reasons, this Court does not 
find any illegality or jurisdictional error in the impugned 
orders of both the Courts below calling for interference 
of this Court in exercise of writ jurisdiction. This 
constitutional petition is accordingly dismissed in limine 
being devoid of any force.
