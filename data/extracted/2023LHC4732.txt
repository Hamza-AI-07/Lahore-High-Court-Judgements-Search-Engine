The Petitioners through this writ Petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) have 
prayed as under: 
 
“It is therefore, respectfully prayed that this honourable 
Court may be pleased to issue a writ of certioraris declaring the 
acts, deeds, designs and motives by CDA respondent No.9 
together with those of respondents No.1(ii), 2 to 5 and 9 in so far 
as they contemplate of creating a new site adjacent to the existing 
one to use the same by the respondent No.9 for dumping garbage, 
waste and stash from the area of ICT, Islamabad as being illegal, 
unlawful, violative of law, oppressive to the lawful rights of 
petitioners and other residents of the vicinity under Article 4, 9, 
14 and 15 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973.  
This honourable court may also issue a writ of mandamus 
directing the respondents to act upon decision/order dated 
18.10.2019 immediately and through a writ of prohibition 
restraining the respondents No.6 and 7 from using the existing 
site in the area of village Lossar, Tehsil & District Rawalpindi 
for dumping of garbage, waste and stash.  
Any additional relief deemed just and proper in view of 
law and principles of justice may also kindly be awarded to the 
petitioners. ” 
 
(I) 
CONTEXT 
3. 
Context of the case is that back in 1986 the Respondent No.6/Municipal 
Corporation, Rawalpindi acquired land measuring 598 kanals 13 marlas under 
the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (the “Act of 1894”) situated in village Losar, 
Tehsil and District, Rawalpindi, which was then handed over to the 
Respondent No.7/Rawalpindi Waste Management Company, who started 
dumping garbage/solid waste at the site. Statedly the site in question was a 
beautiful valley with lush green grassy land, natural water spring and people 
of the vicinity used to bring their cattle for grazing and drinking water but 
quite ironically the same is now become terribly dangerous, injurious and 
hazardous to the lives of the residents. Further averred in the petition that the 
Petitioners already filed a writ Petition No.2327/2019, which was disposed of 
and transmitted to the Respondent No.2/Commissioner Rawalpindi Division, 
Rawalpindi, who passed order dated 18.10.2019 directing the Respondent 

 
 
 
W.P.No.1106 of 2023 
 
 
- 3 - 
No.6 to take positive measures. But the land is now given to the Respondent 
No.9/Capital Development Authority, Islamabad (the “CDA”) for dumping 
the solid waste of the Capital City of Islamabad. Hence, this Petition.  
(II) 
PETITIONER’S SUBMISSIONS 
4. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the Respondent 
No.9/CDA without any lawful authority obtained the land for its use as 
dumping site of solid waste/garbage, which is not permissible even under 
Capital Development Authority Ordinance, 1960 (the “Ordinance”). He added 
that dumping of waste/garbage at site is creating blockage in flow of water of 
the area, which is causing serious health problems and diseases like hepatitis 
and bronchitis, etc. He further stated that in view of the above miserable 
agonies and life-threatening conditions the Petitioners many times approached 
the relevant authorities for implementation of the order dated 18.10.2019, 
passed by the Commissioner Rawalpindi but the Respondent No.9 is adamant 
to use the said land as waste dumping site, hence they are seeking intervention 
of this Court.  
(III) RESPONDENTS’ SUBMISSIONS 
 
(i) Submissions of Respondent No.6/MCR 
5. 
Learned counsel for the Respondent No.6 submitted that the land in 
question was properly acquired and transferred to the Rawalpindi Waste 
Management Company vide mutation No.432 dated 03.05.2001 in 
consideration of Rs.33,80,436/- for the purpose of dumping waste. He stated 
that the site is located almost 30 kilometres away from the Rawalpindi and at 
that time no village was existed within approximately 1.5 kilometre in 
surroundings but now number of brick kilns (Bhattas) and their colonies have 
been constructed. Further stated that due to overwhelming development 
towards that area the land was illegally possessed by land grabbers, which was 
taken back by the Department. He added that the land was handed over to the 
RWMC under Clause 2(d) & 6(i) of the Service and Asset Management 
Agreement dated 28.04.2014 and the waste dumping site was already 

 
 
 
W.P.No.1106 of 2023 
 
 
- 4 - 
established back in 1987 as per rules and regulations, therefore, these Petitions 
are liable to be dismissed.  
 (ii) Submissions of CDA 
6. 
Syed Zeeshan Haider Zaidi, Advocate for Respondent No.9/CDA 
submitted on the basis of their report and parawise comments that the 
Islamabad/Capital City is surrounded by Margala Hills, which provide 
peaceful and serene environment to the residents. He added that the CDA was 
already dumping the solid waste/garbage at Sector H-16 but the residents of 
the area filed a writ Petition before the Hon’ble Islamabad High Court on the 
ground that the garbage was hazardous for their health, which was disposed 
of vide order dated 07.02.2023 with the direction to put up a sustainable waste 
disposal management plan for Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). He added 
that no proper place was located within the limit of the ICT, therefore, it was 
decided to acquire land in question through proper procedure. He objected to 
the maintainability of this Petition by submitting that the site in question is 
suitable and feasible for the purpose of dumping solid waste/garbage.  
7. 
Heard. Record perused.  
(IV) DETERMINATION BY COURT 
8. 
Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case following 
questions arises: 
(I) 
Whether the Respondent No.6/MCR has violated any provision 
of law while granting permission to the Respondent 
No.9/CDA?  
(II) 
Whether the project of dumping solid waste/garbage at site in 
question is being established by the Respondent No.9/CDA in 
violation of fundamental rights i.e. right to life, right to dignity 
and right to movement, guaranteed under the Constitution?  
(III) Whether the Respondent No.9/CDA has fulfilled all the codal 
formalities under the relevant law, rules and regulations prior 
to the acquisition and use of land in question?

9. 
During the Court proceedings, pursuant to the order dated 23.05.2023, 
Mr. Zaheer Abbas Malik, Director General, Punjab Environmental Protection 
Agency, Government of the Punjab, Lahore (the “EPA”) appeared on 
29.05.2023 and filed a Situational Report by stating that they have looked into 
the issue in hand and also suggested certain international best practices to 
resolve this issue of the residents of the area involved as well as the issues of 
the proponent of the project i.e. Solid Waste Department. When confronted 
whether the proponent of a project i.e. Respondent No.9/CDA has obtained 
‘No Objection Certificate’  (NOC) under Section 12(1) of the Punjab 
Environmental Protection Act, 1997 (the “Act”) read with the Punjab 
Environmental Protection (Review of Initial Environmental Examination and 
Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 2022 (the “Regulations”) 
because it has to file an Environmental Impact Assessment (the “EIA”) as per 
the mandatory requirement of law; Director General, EPA submitted that 
under Section 12 read with Regulation 4 of the Regulations [Schedule-II] as 
per the list of projects requiring an EIA, the project falls in category “G. 
Waste Storage and Disposal”, including the landfill sites. He further 
submitted that though the proponent of the project/CDA has filed an EIA but 
it was not completed as per Section 12 of the Act and Regulation 8 of the 
Regulations requiring preliminary scrutiny and, in this regard, certain 
necessary documents were called from the CDA but the same have not been 
provided thus far. He has read from his Situational Report, which suggests 
that the site is not suitable to be used as dumping site/landfill site as per 
international best practices but once the CDA files formal documents before 
him with revised integrated solid management system and a detailed drawings 
alongwith 3-D elevations then the EPA will formally assess this and 
thereafter, publication of the newspaper and hearing will be conducted based 
on that revised report, which will be available to the public at large and 
anybody can object to the same during the process of hearing.  
10. 
Perusal of Section 12 of the Act explains that no proponent of a project 
shall commence construction or operation unless he has filed with the Federal 

 
 
 
W.P.No.1106 of 2023 
 
 
- 6 - 
Agency an Initial Environmental Examination or, where the projects is likely 
to cause an adverse environmental effect, an Environmental Impact 
assessment, and approval from Federal Agency has to be obtained. Statedly 
the proponent of the project/CDA has filed an EIA under Section 12 of the 
Act but it was not completed by the EPA under Regulation 8 of the 
Regulations, due to non-provision of certain necessary documents by the 
CDA. But the procedure as per Section 12 (2), (4) and (7) is still incomplete. 
For ready reference Section 12 is reproduced as under: 
12.  
Initial environmental examination and environmental 
impact assessment. – (1) No proponent of a project shall 
commence construction or operation unless he has filed with the 
Federal Agency an initial environmental examination or, where 
the project is likely to cause an adverse environmental effect, an 
environmental impact assessment, and has obtained from the 
Federal Agency approval in respect thereof.  
(2) 
The Federal Agency shall --- 
(a) review the initial environmental examination and 
accord its approval, or require submission of an 
environmental impact assessment by the proponent; or  
(b) review the environmental impact assessment and 
accord its approval subject to such conditions as it may 
deem fit to impose, or require that the environmental 
impact 
assessment 
be 
re-submitted 
after 
such 
modifications as may be stipulated, or reject the project as 
being contrary to environmental objectives.  
(3) 
 ….  
(4) 
The Federal Agency shall communicate its approval or 
otherwise within a period of four months from the date the 
initial environmental examination or environmental 
impact assessment is filed complete in all respects in 
accordance with the prescribed procedure, failing which 
the initial environmental examination or, as the case may 
be, the environmental impact assessment shall be deemed 
to have been approved, to the extent to which it does not 
contravene the provision of this Act and the rules and 
regulations made thereunder.  
(5) 
…. 
(6) 
…. 
(7) 
The Federal Agency shall maintain separate Registers for 
initial environmental examination and environmental 
impact assessment projects, which shall contain brief 
particulars of each project and a summary of decisions 

 
 
 
W.P.No.1106 of 2023 
 
 
- 7 - 
taken thereon, and which shall be open to inspection by 
the public at all reasonable hours and the disclosure of 
information in such Registers shall be subject to the 
restrictions specified in sub-section (3).  
 
Regulation 8 of the Regulations reads as under: 
8. 
Preliminary scrutiny. (1) The Agency, within ten working 
days of filing of initial environmental examination or 
environmental impact assessment, shall: 
 
(a) 
confirm that the initial environmental examination 
or environmental impact assessment is complete for the 
purpose of initiation of the review process; or  
(b) 
require the proponent to submit such additional 
information as may be required; or  
(c) 
return the initial environmental examination or 
environmental impact assessment to the proponent, 
clearly listing the contents requiring further study and 
discussion.  
(2) 
In case the proponent fails to submit the required 
documents or conduct further study or discussion after three 
notices served to him by the Agency, with a gap of not less than 
seven days, his application shall be closed and he shall be 
required to submit a afresh application for approval.  
(3) 
In case of closure of application under sub-regulation (2), 
the Review Fee shall remain valid for a period of six months from 
the date of closure of Application.  
(4) 
Nothing in sub-regulation (1) shall prohibit the Agency 
from requiring the proponent to submit additional information at 
any stage during the review process.  
 
Hence, the Respondent No.9/CDA is bound to fulfill all the mandatory 
requirements of law and fill up all lacunas on their part so that the EPA should 
decide the EIA before starting use of land in question for the abovesaid 
purposes. As per Section 7 ibid the EPA shall maintain Registers for initial 
environmental examination and environmental impact assessment projects, 
which shall contain brief particulars of each project and a summary of 
decisions taken thereon, which shall be open to inspection by the public at all 
reasonable hours and the disclosure of information in such Registers shall be 
subject to the restrictions specified in sub-section 3 ibid. All shows that the 
public has a right to receive the documents/information before the EPA and 

 
 
 
W.P.No.1106 of 2023 
 
 
- 8 - 
they can also file objection therein. Once the EPA complete the EIA and 
communicate to CDA, who shall complete all the process and then they can 
start work on its project. Guidance is sought from the judgments reported as 
“Naimatullah Khan Advocate and others v. Federation of Pakistan and 
others” (2020 SCMR 1499), “Muhammad Shahid v. Punjab Environmental 
Tribunal, Lahore and others” (2018 CLD 506), “Maple Leaf Cement Factory 
Ltd. v. Environmental Protection Agency and others” (2018 CLD 153), 
“Pakistan Mobile Communication Limited v. Abrar Ahmed and 4 others” 
(2019 CLD 578) and “Haji Sher Zaman Khan v. Government of Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa through Chief Secretary and 8 others” (2020 CLD 1232).  
11. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in the judgment 2020 SCMR 1499 
(supra) on the point of projects having a negative impact on the ecology and 
environment, has observed that: 
“even the Federal Government does not have the authority to sanction 
an Act which is not supported by statutory dispensation and has a direct 
negative impact on the ecology and environment in which future 
generations of the people of Pakistan have an overriding and inherent 
interest.” 
 
12. 
Today, Syed Zeeshan Haider Zaidi, Advocate for Respondent 
No.9/CDA submitted that admittedly the EIA is still incomplete, therefore, 
they be granted an opportunity to submit their documents before the EPA. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners and other Respondents did not raise any 
objection rather conceded with the same provided a direction be issued for its 
expeditious completion.  
13. 
Be that as it may, these Petitions stand disposed of with the direction 
that 
the 
Respondent 
No.9/CDA 
shall 
submit 
all 
the 
required 
documents/records in the EIA before the EPA, who shall conduct scrutiny 
within the time frame, then make publication in newspapers  (Urdu and 
English newspapers), place it in District Council Hall Rawalpindi and 
complete the same in accordance with law, rules, regulations (Section 12 and 
Regulation 8 ibid) and policy applicable thereto, after providing proper

hearing to all the concerned including the Petitioners. Parties are directed to 
appear there and submit their objections/documents, if so advised.
