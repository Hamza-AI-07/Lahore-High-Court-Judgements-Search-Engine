             SADIQ MAHMUD KHURRAM, J: Through the instant 
criminal revision petition, the petitioner has assailed the vires of the 
impugned order dated 01.10.2022, passed by the learned Special judge, 
Anti-Corruption Court, Bahawalpur, whereby the application submitted 
by the petitioner under sections 94 and 540 Cr.P.C. seeking to produce 
copies of certain documents, as part of prosecution evidence, was 
rejected.  
2.              The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner is the 
complainant of case FIR No.226 of 2003, dated 10.08.2003 registered 
at Police Station Cantt. Bahawalpur , District Bahawalpur  in respect of 
offences under sections 409,420, 468 ,471 and 109 of P.P.C.  and under 
section 5 of the Prevention of the Corruption Act (Act No.II) of 1947. 
During the course of the trial, after  the accused  had been examined by 
the learned trial court under section 342 Cr.P.C. on 20.01.2022, the 
petitioner submitted an application under sections 94 and 540 Cr.P.C. 
seeking to produce copies of certain documents as part of prosecution 
evidence on 02.02.2022, which application was dismissed by the 

Criminal Revision  No. 217 of 2022

learned Special judge, Anti-Corruption Court, Bahawalpur, vide order 
dated 01.10.2022, hence, the instant petition.  
 
3.           The learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General  submitted that the order dated 01.10.2022, passed 
by the learned Special judge, Anti-Corruption Court, Bahawalpur, 
whereby the application submitted by the petitioner under sections 94 
and 540 Cr.P.C. seeking to produce copies of certain documents as part 
of prosecution evidence was dismissed, is liable to be set aside being 
against the facts and law; that the learned Special judge, Anti-
Corruption Court, Bahawalpur in its order  had incorrectly held that the 
application  was  made  for  the  purpose  of   vexation  and  delay  in 
the conclusion of the trial.  
 
4.            The respondent No.3, in person, submitted that the order dated 
01.10.2022, passed by the learned Special judge, Anti-Corruption 
Court, Bahawalpur was in accordance with the law and facts and 
merited no interference. 
 
5.            I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General, the respondent No.3 and perused the record 
with their able assistance.  
 
6.         It evinces from the record that during the course of the trial, 
after  the accused  had been examined by the learned trial court under 
section 342 Cr.P.C. on 20.01.2022, the petitioner submitted an 
application under sections 94 and 540 Cr.P.C. seeking to produce 
copies of certain documents as part of prosecution evidence on 
02.02.2022, which application was dismissed by the learned Special 
judge, Anti-Corruption Court, Bahawalpur, vide order dated 
01.10.2022. A perusal of the application submitted by the petitioner 
reveals that it was submitted under sections 94 and 540 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 , however, the prayer made therein was to 
allow the production of the documents as mentioned in the application

as part of prosecution evidence and no person having the custody of the 
said documents was sought to be summoned nor any witness was 
sought to be examined who had prepared the said documents. The 
provisions of sections 94 and 540 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 are very much clear. Section 94 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898 provides as under:- 
“94. Summons to produce document or other thing: (1) Whenever 
any Court, or, any officer incharge of a police-station considers that the 
production of any document or other thing is necessary or desirable for 
the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding 
under this Code by or before such Court or officer, such Court may 
issue a summons, or such officer a written order, to the person in 
whose possession or power such document or thing is believed to 
be, requiring him to attend and produce it or to produce it, at the time 
and place stated in the summons or order:--- 
 
Provided that no such officer shall issue any such order requiring the 
production of any document or other thing which is in the custody of a 
bank or banker as defined in the Banker’s Books Evidence Act, 1891 
(XVII of 1891), and relates, or might disclose any information which 
relates to the bank account of any person except,--- 
 
(a) for the purpose of investigating an offence under Sections 403, 406, 
408 and 409 and Sections 421 to 424 (both inclusive) and Sections 465 
to 477-A (both inclusive) of the Pakistan Penal Code, with prior 
permission in writing of a Sessions Judge; and 
 
(b) in other cases, with the prior permission in writing of the High 
Court. 
 
(2) Any person required under this section merely to produce a 
document or other thing shall be deemed to have complied with the 
requisition if he causes such document or thing to be produced instead 
of attending personally to produce the same. 
 
(3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the Evidence Act, 
1872, Sections 123 and 124, or to apply to a letter, postcard, telegram 
or other document or any parcel or thing in the custody of the Postal or 
Telegraph Authorities.” (emphasis supplied)  

Criminal Revision  No. 217 of 2022

. 
 
Section 540 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 proves as under:- 
 
“540. Power to summon material witness or examine person present: 
Any Court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under 
this Code summon any person as a witness, or examine any person in 
attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or re-call and re-examine 
any person already examined; and the Court shall summon and examine or 
re-call and re-examine any such person if his evidence appears to it 
essential to the just decision of the case.” (emphasis supplied)  
 
A perusal of sections 94 and 540 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 , makes it abundantly clear that the power of the court under 
sections 94 and 540 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 is to 
summon a person having the custody of the said documents or summon 
any person as a witness whose evidence appears to be essential to the 
just decision of the case.  As mentioned above, the petitioner in the 
application submitted by him under sections 94 and 540 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 , had not sought the summoning of any 
person having the custody of the said documents nor sought that any 
person be examined as a witness who had prepared the said documents. 
The learned Special judge, Anti-Corruption Court, Bahawalpur was 
right to observe that the powers of the learned trial court provided under 
sections 94 and 540 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 did not 
allow for the production of any documents without the summoning of 
the person having the custody of the said documents or without the 
summoning of any witness who had prepared the said documents. No 
doubt that under article 88 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, the certified 
copies of the public documents may be  produced in proof of the 
contents of the public documents or parts of the public documents of 
which they purport to be copies, however, still they need to be produced 
in accordance with the procedure provided for their production. It is 
only section 510 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 which allows 
certain documents mentioned therein to be used as evidence in any 

Criminal Revision  No. 217 of 2022

inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898  without calling the maker of the said documents as a witness. The 
documents sought to be used as evidence by the petitioner during the 
trial are not the documents which can be used as evidence without 
calling the maker of the same as a witness under the provisions of 
section 510 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. Then the stage at 
which the petitioner moved the application is also very relevant in this 
particular case. The application was submitted by the petitioner on 
02.02.2022, after  the accused  had been examined by the learned trial 
court under section 342 Cr.P.C. on 20.01.2022. The case was registered 
on 10.08.2003 , the trial of which is yet to conclude.  No one party can 
be allowed to lead evidence just to fill in the lacuna of any party by 
using the provisions of section 540 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898. If this is allowed, trials will never come to an end. The learned 
trial court has certainly been vested with adequate powers under section 
540, Cr.P.C. to summon and examine or re-summon and re-examine 
any witness in the trial before pronouncing the final verdict, but said  
provisions of the Code do not ingrain any such interpretation whereby 
it should be  allowed to be used by a party to fill-in the lacunae of its 
case or to unnecessarily protract proceedings of the trial to defeat the 
ends of justice. This is what the learned trial Court has kept in view 
while dealing with the application of the petitioner.  There was no 
occasion for the learned trial court to have thought in terms, otherwise.  
The impugned order has been passed strictly in accordance with the 
requirement of the law and it did not lack any virtue of a legal order. 
The rejection of the application submitted by the petitioner  does not 
amount to miscarriage of justice in any way. The revisional jurisdiction 
of this Court can be exercised only when there are exceptional 
circumstances and the order impugned is perverse or suffering from any 
type of infirmity however, in the present case ,the order dated 
01.10.2022, passed by the learned Special judge, Anti-Corruption 
Court, Bahawalpu,r does not suffer from any illegality.

7.          In view of the above discussion, this criminal revision petition, 
being devoid of any merit, is dismissed and the order dated 01.10.2022, 
passed by the learned Special judge, Anti-Corruption Court, 
Bahawalpur, is upheld.
