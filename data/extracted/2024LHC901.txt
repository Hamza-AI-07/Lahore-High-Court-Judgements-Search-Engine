(Aamir Hayat v. The State)  
2. 
The edifice of the prosecution story is structured on the statement 
of Allah Yar who being the complainant got recorded his statement as 
(PW.2) which is to the following effect: 
“Stated that on 08.09.2014 at about 7.00 am, my son Aamir 
Shehzad left the house for selling and purchasing milk and was going 
towards dera of Zulfiqar Gondal. When he reached in the landed area of 
Lal Khan, accused Aamir, Imran, Ansar alongwith two unknown 
accused while armed with pistols were already present there. They came 
out there from and intercepted and halted him. Accused Aamir raised 
lalkara that today Aamir Shehzad should not be spared, he with the 
intention to kill him made two fires with his pistol, one hit upon on his 
face near moustaches on right side of the face; whereas, he made second 
fire which hit upon his left arm. Thereafter, accused Imran made fire 
with his pistol which hit upon his abdomen. Other unknown accused 
alnogwith Ansar remained making aerial firing with the threats and 
lalkaras that if any one step forward they would kill him. The occurrence 
was seen by Gul Anaar and Muhammad Asghar.  
Witness Gul Anaar informed me about the occurrence through 
mobile phone. After receiving information I reached the place of 
occurrence, my son Aamir Shehzad was lying on the ground and was 
seriously injured. I arranged a car and shifted him to DHQ Hospital. 
When we reached there, keeping in view the condition of my son the 
doctors referred us to Jinnah Hospital, Lahore for further treatment. 
When we reached in the emergency department of hospital of Jinnah 
Hospital, there he succumbed to the injuries. I returned to DHQ 
Sargodha for conducting postmortem upon the dead body. I asked Azam 
and Liaqat to remain with the dead and I myself went to the police 
station for reporting the matter. On my statement FIR Exh.PB was 
registered.  
Motive behind the occurrence was that as my son and other 
residents of „Deha‟ and Amir Hayat accused were used to play 
volleyball. The accused had forbidden my son to play volleyball. Due to 
this fact quarrel had taken place and due to this grudge, after two days 
the occurrence had taken place. During the course of investigation I and 
the witnesses fully supported the contents of the FIR but local police had 
become collusive with the accused party and declared accused Imran 
innocent. This attitude of the police shattered our confidence due to this 
fact I was constrained to file complaint Exh.PC. 
The local police during the course of investigation came to the 
place of occurrence and inspected the same. Blood stained earth was 
taken into possession through recovery memo Exh.PD. I alongwith Gul 
Anaar signed the same as attesting witness. My signature thereupon are 
Exh.PD/1. Three empties of pistol 30 bore were taken into possession 
from the place of occurrence and was sealed and taken into possession 
through recovery memo Exh.PE. I alongwith Gul Anaar signed the same 
as attesting witnesses. My signatures thereupon are Exh.PE/1.

(The State v. Aamir Hayat) 
Criminal Appeal No.193965 of 2018  
(Aamir Hayat v. The State)  
At the time of occurrence my deceased son was riding on a 
motorcycle bearing registration No.SGN/3974 maker super star and 
same was also lying on the place of occurrence and was taken into 
possession through recovery memo Exh.PF. I alongwith Gul Anaar 
signed the same as attesting witnesses my signature thereupon Exh.PF/1. 
My statement was recorded by the I.O. u/s 161 Cr.P.C.”   
3. 
Before moving further it would not be out of place to mention here 
that initially with regard to the alleged occurrence F.I.R. No.464 dated 
08.09.2014 was registered under Sections 302/ 148/ 149 “PPC” at Police 
Station Jhal Chakian, Sargodha, however, being dissatisfied, the 
complainant filed private complaint which was dealt with by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Sargodha. After noting down the cursory 
statements in the private complaint, the appellant was summoned as 
accused vide order dated 14.09.2015 whereas co-accused namely Imran 
was declared as Proclaimed Offender. The appellant Aamir Hayat being 
accused, however, appeared before the learned trial court who delivered 
the copies of the documents as required under Section 241(2)(a) of the 
“Cr.P.C”. The appellant was formally charge sheeted on 17.06.2016 to 
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.  
4. 
In order to bring home guilt of the appellant the prosecution 
examined as many as nine witnesses in support of the charge and in 
addition thereto Rab Nawaz, S.I, Zaigham Nisar, S.I, Muhammad Ameen, 
S.I, being Investigating Officers appeared as CW-1 to CW-3 respectively 
whereas statement of Dr. Usman Imtiaz, CMO was recorded as CW-4. 
Muhammad Azam being unnecessary witness, was given up by the 
prosecution and after tendering reports of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore (hereinafter referred to as “PFSA”) including blood 
stained earth (Exh.PD) and pistol .30 bore P.1 (Exh.PE), the prosecution 
evidence was closed. On completion of prosecution evidence, the 
appellant got recorded his statement under Section 342 of “Cr.P.C.” 
wherein he pleaded his innocence. The appellant though did not opt to 
record his statement on oath as required under Seciton 340(2) of “Cr.P.C.” 
but he tendered certain documents in his defence. On conclusion of trial, 
the appellant was held guilty of offence under Section 302 (b) of “PPC”

(The State v. Aamir Hayat) 
Criminal Appeal No.193965 of 2018  
(Aamir Hayat v. The State)  
and was sentenced to death vide judgment dated 03.03.2018. He was also 
directed to pay a sum of Rs.200,000/- as compensation to legal heirs of 
Aamir Shehzad deceased under Section 544-A of “Cr.P.C.” In default of 
payment of compensation, the appellant was held liable to further undergo 
a period of six months Simple Imprisonment.  
5. 
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that F.I.R. was lodged 
with a considerable delay. He added that occurrence was unseen and the 
alleged eyewitnesses are only chance witnesses. Learned counsel argued 
with vehemence that ocular account is even not corroborated from the 
medical evidence. It is contended that the prosecution has badly failed to 
prove its case against the appellant. Learned counsel emphasized that 
though motive was alleged in the F.I.R. but it was not proved. It is further 
contended that a pistol was though shown got recovered from the 
appellant but negative report of the “PFSA” discarded such recovery. 
Learned counsel in the last submitted that in view of the available material 
conviction of the appellant cannot sustain.  
6. 
Conversely, learned Additional Prosecutor General assisted by the 
learned counsel for the complainant defended the impugned judgment. It 
is argued that while examining the eyewitnesses, the prosecution has been 
able to successfully bring whom guilt of the appellant. Learned Prosecutor 
submitted that the delay in lodging the F.I.R. was sufficiently explained as 
the deceased was initially taken to District Headquarters Hospital, 
Sargodha in a critical condition whereafter he was shifted to Lahore. 
Learned Additional Prosecutor General added that the alleged occurrence 
took place in the morning and the eyewitnesses are natural witnesses of 
the crime. It is contended that the prosecution has successfully discharged 
its onus with regard to the commission of the crime by the appellant.  
7. 
We have heard learned counsel for the appellant as well as learned 
Additional Prosecutor General assisted by learned counsel for the 
complainant at considerable length and perused the record.

(The State v. Aamir Hayat)

(Aamir Hayat v. The State)  
8. 
The prosecution in this case was set to motion on the statement of 
Allah Yar who is father of deceased Aamir Shehzad. As per his statement, 
his son was assassinated by the appellant along with his co-accused 
through successive fire shots which landed on vital parts of body of Amir 
Shahzad who was shifted to DHQ Hospital, Sargodha though in an 
injured condition but succumbed to the injuries later. As per his statement, 
the alleged occurrence was witnessed by Gul Anaar (PW.3) and 
Muhammad Asghar (PW.4) who informed him through telephone about 
the occurrence. The motive behind the occurrence statedly was that 
appellant Aamir Hayat along with his co-accused forbidden the deceased 
from playing volleyball in the ground which was adjacent to the house of 
appellant. 
9. 
In order to examine the validity of the judgment passed by the 
learned Additional Sessions Judge resulting into conviction of the 
appellant, we when bisected the limbs of prosecution evidence it 
comprises of ocular account in the shape of statements of Allah Yar 
(PW.2), Gul Anaar (PW.3), Muhammad Asghar (PW.4), medical 
evidence, recovery of pistol and at the last motive part. We have noticed 
that the alleged occurrence took place at 07:10 am whereas it was reported 
to the police at 07:30 pm. There is thus delay of more than twelve hours. 
The explanation to this effect is though offered that on account of 
precarious condition of Aamir Shehzad (deceased), he was initially shifted 
to DHQ Hospital, Sargodha from where he was referred to Jinnah 
Hospital, Lahore for further treatment where he succumbed to the injuries 
and took his last breath but it is apparent from the record that despite 
having ample time to report the matter to the police, the complainant took 
considerable time for the said purpose. We entertain no doubt in our mind 
to hold that the prosecution has not been able to ably explain the delay in 
lodging the F.I.R. This delay surely occurred for the purpose of 
deliberation and concoction.  
10. 
The alleged occurrence was not witnessed by complainant Allah 
Yar (PW.2). The complaint was lodged on the basis of information 

6 
Murder Reference No.137 of 2018 
(The State v. Aamir Hayat) 
Criminal Appeal No.193965 of 2018  
(Aamir Hayat v. The State)  
furnished by Gul Anaar and Muhammad Asghar (PW.3) and (PW.4) 
respectively who are purportedly the eyewitnesses of the occurrence. 
While examining their statements we find that both these witnesses were 
not residents of the vicinity and they were residing at faraway places from 
the venue of occurrence. Apparently both these witnesses are chance 
witnesses and in order to establish their presence at the venue of 
occurrence, they were supposed to provide satisfactory explanation with 
regard to their presence at the site at the relevant time. From the perusal of 
their statements it can easily be inferred that they were unable to give a 
plausible explanation with regard to their presence at the place of 
occurrence when the alleged offence took place. Gul Anaar (PW.3) is 
brother of the complainant and uncle of the deceased whereas Muhammad 
Asghar (PW.4) is close friend of the deceased who even failed to justify 
his presence at the place of occurrence in the early hours of the day in the 
company of Gul Anaar (PW.3). A chance witness is a witness who 
claimed that he was present at the crime spot well in time though his 
presence in ordinary course of business was sheer chance. The testimony 
of chance witness is always to be examined by the courts with a hard look 
as in normal course the presumption would be that such witness was not 
present at the crime spot. Needless to observe that a chance witness has to 
undergo strict scrutiny so as to qualify as a reliable witness. Guidance to 
this effect can be sought from the cases reported as “Naveed Asghar and 
2 others v. The State” (PLD 2021 SC 600) and “Mst. Rukhsana Begum 
and others v. Sajjad and others” (2017 SCMR 596).  
11. 
There is yet another aspect which causes serious aspersions qua 
status of alleged eyewitnesses as initially on the basis of their information, 
the complainant nominated the appellant along with Imran as one of the 
perpetrators of the offence along with three unknown assailants but later 
on Gul Anaar (PW.3) disclosed the name of one of unknown accused as 
Ansar without mentioning as to how he became acquainted with the name 
of said accused whereas two of them are still mystery. Furthermore in 

7 
Murder Reference No.137 of 2018 
(The State v. Aamir Hayat) 
Criminal Appeal No.193965 of 2018  
(Aamir Hayat v. The State)  
order to justify their presence at the scene of occurrence both these 
witnesses have introduced notable improvements in their statements.  
12. 
The ocular account furnished by the eyewitnesses does not find 
support from the medical evidence. As per allegations recorded in the 
F.I.R and the statements of the complainant and eyewitnesses, the 
appellant fired two shots with his pistol at the body of the deceased which 
landed on his face and left arm whereas accused Imran fired at the 
deceased which hit him on his abdomen. Contrary to this, Dr. Muhammad 
Asif (PW.7) who conducted postmortem of the deceased when entered 
into witness box while giving description of injuries termed injury No.5 
“a firearm wound of reentry 3 x 1 cm on interio lateral side of left 
forearm, 03 cm below left elbow joint crease” which clearly negates the 
version of the witnesses that the appellant fired two shots one of which hit 
on the left arm of the deceased. This material conflict in the oral account 
and the medical evidence lends support to the conclusion that the 
occurrence was in fact not witnessed by Gul Anaar and Muhammad 
Asghar (PW.3) and (PW.4) respectively.  
13.  
It is though claim of the prosecution that pistol .30 bore was 
recovered from the appellant on 08.03.2016 which was taken into 
possession through recovery memo (Exh.PN) but as per report of “PFSA” 
(Exh.PV), pistol (P.4) purportedly recovered from the appellant, when 
examined was not found matched with the crime empties collected from 
the place of occurrence. The recovery of pistol and the crime empties in 
the circumstances is thus completely inconsequential.  
14. 
We also entertain no doubt in our minds that the prosecution has 
though set up a specific motive for the offence but it was neither stated by 
the witnesses with full heart nor proved at all.  
15. 
It is though argued before us on behalf of the prosecution that the 
appellant had remained fugitive from law for a considerable period but in 
absence of any cogent and confidence inspiring evidence qua his guilt, we 
cannot held him guilty of the offence merely on account of his 

8 
Murder Reference No.137 of 2018 
(The State v. Aamir Hayat) 
Criminal Appeal No.193965 of 2018  
(Aamir Hayat v. The State)  
abscondence which at the most can be termed as a corroborative piece of 
evidence.  
16. 
In the light of above noted threadbare discussion, we are of the 
considered opinion that the prosecution case is fraught with doubts. 
Needless to observe that an accused is always to be treated as innocent 
unless it is proved otherwise. Sections 375 and 376 of “Cr.P.C.” cast a 
duty upon the High Court to examine and reappraise each and every piece 
of evidence before confirming or repelling the view of the trial court qua 
the guilt of the accused. It is an oft repeated principle of law that 
whenever a reasonable doubt emerges with regard to the involvement of 
the accused in the alleged offence, he should be benefitted with the same 
without any hesitation. For the said purpose it is not necessary that there 
should be multiple anomalies creating doubt in the prosecution case but 
even if a single circumstance creates reasonable doubt that would be 
sufficient. We, thus, are of the considered view that the prosecution has 
failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond shadow of doubt.  
17. 
Resultantly, we allow Criminal Appeal No.193965 of 2018 filed by 
Aamir Hayat appellant and set-aside his conviction and sentence awarded 
by the learned trial court vide Judgment dated 03.03.2018. Consequently, 
the appellant namely Aamir Hayat is acquitted of the charge by extending 
him the benefit of doubt and he shall be released forthwith from jail, if not 
required to be detained in connection with any other case. Murder 
Reference No.137 of 2018 is thus answered in NEGATIVE and death 
sentence of present appellant Aamir Hayat is NOT CONFIRMED.
