Muzamil Akhtar Shabir J. The appellants, 
through this First Appeal Against Order have called in 
question order dated 10.5.2024 passed by learned Judge 
Banking Court, Bahawalpur, whereby their application for 
restoration of an earlier application filed by them for 
setting-aside ex-parte judgment and decree dated 
30.7.2017 passed by the learned Judge, Banking Court, 
Bahawalpur, has been dismissed with costs of 
Rs.100,000/-.  
2.   
The contention raised by the learned counsel 
for the appellants is that the appellants earlier had 
challenged the said decree by filing R.F.A.No. 41 of 
2019/BWP before this Court, however, the said Appeal 
had been withdrawn to pursue the remedy of application 
under Order IX Rule 13 of C.P.C, which was also treated 
as an application under Section 12 of Financial 
Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001, 
for setting-aside ex-parte judgment and decree pending 
before the Banking Court, without knowledge that the 
said application had already been dismissed for non-
prosecution by the Banking Court, hence, necessitating 
in filing of application for its restoration, which 
application from the date of knowledge was within time 
but still had been dismissed by holding that this case is 

    F.A.O.No. 41 of 2024/BWP 
2 
 
an example of hide and seek along with abuse of process 
of court by the judgment debtors and without force, 
which observation by the Banking Court is not 
sustainable and the application should have been 
decided on the basis of merit instead of technicalities.  
3.    
On the other hand, learned counsel for the 
respondent-Bank states that the instant Appeal is not 
maintainable as the impugned order dated 10.05.2024 is 
an interlocutory order and not a final order. 
4.  
The appellants had challenged the ex-parte 
decree passed by the Banking Court by seeking two 
remedies side by side i.e. one by filing an application 
under Order IX Rule 13 CPC for setting aside ex-parte 
proceedings and judgment and decree before the 
Banking Court and another by filing R.F.A.No. 41 of 
2019/BWP before this Court. The said appeal was later 
on withdrawn vide order of this Court dated 17.02.2021, 
reproduced below: 
“ 
It is contended by learned counsel for the 
appellants that in order to pursue the remedy of 
application under Order IX Rule 13 of C.P.C for 
setting aside exparte judgment and decree, he does 
not want to press this appeal for time being. 
2.  
Disposed of accordingly.” 
 
5.    
The appellants claim to have thereafter 
approached the Banking Court for decision their 
application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC, where it 
transpired that the same had also been dismissed for 
non-prosecution vide order dated 07.02.2019 resulting 
in filing of restoration application.  
6.    
The impugned order dated 10.05.2024 passed 
by the learned Judge Banking Court, Bahawalpur, 
whereby 
application 
for 
restoration 
of 
earlier 
application of the appellants has been dismissed, is 
reproduced below:- 

    F.A.O.No. 41 of 2024/BWP

“5.  
In this case the loan was disbursed in 2007. 
The suit was instituted in the year 2009. The 
petitioners and their predecessor namely Zamir 
Ahmed were defendant Nos. 1 & 2. The defendants 
submitted application for leave to appear and defend 
the suit which was accepted but thereafter the suit was 
dismissed for non-prosecution after which an 
application for restoration of the suit was made by the 
plaintiff/Bank. The petitioners/defendants did not 
appear despite service and the suit was restored. 
Thereafter nobody appeared on behalf of the 
petitioners/judgment debtors for long time and ex-
parte judgment and decree was passed on 03/10/2017. 
The petitioners made the application for setting aside 
ex-parte decree on 13/12/2017 which was beyond the 
period of limitation. Said application was also 
dismissed vide order dated 07/02/2019. The 
petitioners/judgment debtors also referred RFA No. 
41/2019/BWP which was withdrawn on 17/02/2021 
with the contention that the applicants/petitioners 
wanted to pursue application setting aside ex-parte 
decree. The main point to be considered here is that 
application for setting aside ex-parte decree was 
dismissed for non-prosecution on 07/02/2019 but on 
17/02/2021 
learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
applicants/petitioners 
made 
statement 
before 
Honorable Lahore High Court, Bahawalpur Bench, 
Bahawalpur that he wanted to pursue application for 
setting-aside ex-parte decree. Said application  did 
not exist on 17/02/2021 and on 15/07/2021 the 
petitioners made the application in hand. This case 
pertains to suit for recovery based upon Financial 
Institution (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001. 
The purpose of said Ordinance was to effect the 
recoveries in a fast way that is way in the presence of 
Ordinance procedure Special Courts were continued. 
This case is an example of hide and seek along with 
abuse of process of Court by the petitioner/judgment 
debtors. The application are without force same are 
dismissed with Rs. 100,000/- cost which shall be 
deposited by the petitioner/judgment debtors on next 
date of hearing. The judgment debtor is also directed 
to deposit the decretal amount on next date of hearing. 
Now to come up for payment of cost and decretal 
amount by the judgment debtors on 01/06/2024.” 
 
  
  
The afore-referred order does not show that 
proper consideration has been given to the facts of the 
case while dismissing application on technical grounds 
solely for the reasons that the appellants had sought to 
pursue remedy by filing application for setting-aside ex-

    F.A.O.No. 41 of 2024/BWP 
4 
 
parte decree before the Banking Court, which 
application already stood dismissed for non-prosecution 
on 07.02.2019 and subsequent application filed on 
15.07.2021 for its restoration was held to be not 
maintainable, which reason is not sustainable in view of 
facts of the instant case for the reason that the appellants 
had filed the second application for restoration of the 
first application, which has been dismissed through the 
impugned order without discussing its merits.  
7.    
Perusal of the record also shows that 
application for restoration of earlier application has 
been dismissed by the learned Banking court on 
technical grounds, which had finally disposed of the 
matter agitated through the said application, therefore, 
finality is attached to the said order and the same cannot 
be treated as interlocutory order. The Appeal in terms of 
Section 22 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of 
Finances) Ordinance, 2001, is available against all final 
orders and if it be a decree in the shape of Regular First 
Appeal before this Court and against all final orders in 
shape of an Appeal against Order, therefore, objection 
of the learned counsel for the respondent is not 
sustainable as no other remedy against the said order 
except through filing of appeal against said order is 
available to the appellants.  
8.    
Next question for determination is whether 
the said application for restoration of earlier application, 
which 
was 
dismissed 
for 
non-prosecution 
on 
17.02.2019 was maintainable or not. The appellant had 
challenged the decree dated 03.10.2017 by availing two 
remedies; first by filing Regular First Appeal against the 
said decree on 08.12.2017 before this Court and another 
by filing an application for setting-aside ex-parte decree 

    F.A.O.No. 41 of 2024/BWP 
5 
 
on 13.12.2017 before the Banking Court. Although 
generally in terms of principle laid down in judgment 
reported as 2024  SCMR  518 (CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER NPGCL, GENCO-III, TPS MUZAFARGARRAH 
versus KHALID UMAR TARIQ IMRAN), wherein it has been 
held that when an aggrieved person intends to 
commence any legal action to enforce any right and/or 
invoke a remedy to set right a wrong or to vindicate an 
injury, he has to elect and/or choose from amongst the 
actions or remedies available under the law. Choice to 
initiate and pursue one out of the available concurrent 
or coexistent actions or remedy from a forum of 
competent jurisdiction vests with the aggrieved person. 
Once the choice is exercised and the election is made 
then the aggrieved person is prohibited from launching 
another proceeding to seek relief or remedy contrary to 
what could be claimed and/or achieved by adopting 
other proceeding/action and/or remedy, which in legal 
parlance is recognized as 'doctrine of election’ yet there 
was no bar under the law for availing the said two 
remedies simultaneously in view of the principles laid 
down by the Supreme Court in judgment reported as 
PLD 2018 Supreme Court 828 (Trading Corporation of 
Pakistan versus Devan Sugar Mills Limited and others), 
however, the conclusion of one remedy would have 
resulted in the other remedy as having become 
infructuous. 
9.    
The remedy of filing application for setting- 
aside ex-parte decree initiated on 13.12.2017 resulted in 
dismissal of the said application for non-prosecution on 
07.02.2019 in the manner that the Banking Court 
observed that the case had been repeatedly called since 
morning and even thrice, every time but none had 
entered appearance on behalf of defendants No. 4. The 

    F.A.O.No. 41 of 2024/BWP 
6 
 
time of the court was almost over, therefore, the 
application for setting-aside decree and extension of 
time on behalf of defendant No. 4 was dismissed due to 
non-prosecution.  
  
  
On the other hand in the R.F.A.No. 41 of 
2019/BWP, which was pending before this Court it had 
not been pointed out by either of the parties or their 
counsel, despite their availability before this Court that 
the afore-referred application had already been 
dismissed and on being confronted with the question of 
availability of remedy before the Banking Court, the 
Appeal was withdrawn to further pursue the said 
remedy. Hence, withdrawal of RFA with permission to 
pursue other remedy could not be treated to have 
rendered the remedy of pursuing his application for 
setting-aside ex-parte decree as infructuous, however, it 
appears that on the said date none of the parties was 
aware of dismissal of the application before the Banking 
Court and when the appellants approached the said court 
for availing the said remedy in terms of permission 
sought from this Court, it transpired that the said 
application had been dismissed. Had it been pointed out 
by the counsel for the respondent or was within the 
knowledge of the appellants that the said application had 
already been dismissed, they may have asked for this 
Court to decide the Appeal on its own merits instead of 
permitting them to pursue the remedy before the 
Banking Court for the reason that withdrawal of Appeal 
from this Court had also deprived them of seeking 
further remedy against the order passed in R.F.A. No 41 
of 2019/BWP before any higher forum and in such a 
situation, such an order may cause prejudice to the rights 
of the appellants to seek remedy available to them under 

    F.A.O.No. 41 of 2024/BWP 
7 
 
the law and an act of court cannot be allowed to stand in 
the way of remedy available to a person for the reason 
that act of court should prejudice no one. Reliance is 
placed on 2023 SCMR 334 (Abdul Quddous versus 
Commandant Frontier Constabulary, Khyber Pakhtun 
Khawa, Peshawar and another). In this view of the matter, 
when both parties were ignorant of fact of dismissal of 
application for non-prosecution, the conduct of the 
appellants seeking withdrawal of appeal to seek remedy 
though application for setting aside ex-parte decree 
could not be treated as contumacious to disentitle the 
appellants for pursuing the remedy for its restoration.  
Generally, when both the parties had not appeared in the 
court when a petition/application is dismissed for non-
prosecution, the courts liberally allow application for 
restoration, for which reliance may be placed on 2023 
CLC 963 (KHALID IQBAL and others Versus Mst. 
YASEEN and others), PLD 2019 Lahore 723 (SAEED 
AHMAD Versus Mst. GHULAM FATIMA), 2020 CLC 
1318 (SARDAR TABARIK ALI and another Versus 
ADMINISTRATOR 
MUNICIPAL 
CORPORATION, 
MUZAFFARABAD and 6 others), 2012 MLD 812 (JAN 
Versus. ABDUL RAZZAQ) and PLD 2008 Karachi 103 
(Messrs FATEH TEXTILE MILLS LTD Versus. WEST 
PAKISTAN 
INDUSTRIAL 
DEVELOPMENT 
CORPORATION). Furthermore, limitation for filing 
application for restoration of an earlier application, 
which has been dismissed for non-prosecution  is 
governed by Article 181 of the Limitation Act, 1908, 
providing for limitation of 3-years and the application 
for restoration had been filed prior to its expiry, 
therefore, the same was within time, hence, we have 
refrained ourselves to comment upon the merits of 

    F.A.O.No. 41 of 2024/BWP 
8 
 
application for condonation of delay filed by the 
appellants along with the application for restoration.  
10.    
In view thereof, we are inclined to set-aside 
the impugned order dated 10.05.2024 passed by Judge 
Banking Court, Bahawalpur, with the result that the 
order of dismissal of application for restoration 
application is set aside and the said application is 
allowed with observation that the application for 
setting-aside ex-parte decree shall be deemed to be 
pending before the Banking Court along with its 
accompanying application, if any filed, which shall be 
decided on its own merits in accordance with law. This 
Appeal is allowed in the foregoing terms.
