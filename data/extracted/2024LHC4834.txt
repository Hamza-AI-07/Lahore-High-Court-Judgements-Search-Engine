Objection case 
 
The office has raised the objection at Serial No. 26 
of the objection sheet to file this petition before 
appropriate forum (i.e. Directorate of District Judiciary of 
Lahore High Court, Lahore). 
2. 
As the afore-mentioned office objection relates to 
the maintainability of this petition before this Court, 
therefore, the same is required to be decided at the 
judicial side, hence the office is directed to number this 
petition and fix it for hearing on the judicial side for 
today, where the said objection shall be considered on its 
own merits.  
Main case (Writ Petition No.14846 of 2024) 
3. 
The petitioner namely Mst. Kiran Saba daughter of 
Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, through this petition has prayed 
as under: 

2 
WP No. 14846 of 2024 
Dated 05.11.2024 
“Under the above submissions, it is therefore, most 
respectfully prayed that this writ petition may very kindly 
be accepted and an appropriate writ, order or direction 
may very graciously be issued to the Learned respondent 
No.1 to conclude the family suit of the petitioner 
expeditiously in the light of period specified in West 
Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964, so that the justice may be 
done. 
Any other relief, which this Hon'ble Court deems fit, 
just and proper, may also be awarded to the petitioner.” 
 
4. 
The claim of the petitioner is that she was married 
to the respondent No.2, Faisal Hayat son of Khizer Hayat 
on 28.10.2023 but no child was born from the said 
wedlock. On being expelled from the house of the 
respondent No.2 she filed suit for dissolution of 
marriage, recovery of maintenance allowance, dowry 
articles, gold ornaments, residential house in terms of 
agreement and dower on 01.04.2024 against respondent 
No.2 and his father (Khizar Hayat/respondent No.3), 
which is pending till today in the Family Court, Darya 
Khan, District Bhakkar despite the fact that the Family 
Court was required to decide the same within six months 
in terms of Section 12-A of the Family Court Act, 1964 
(“Act”) whereas much more time has passed. Seeks early 
disposal of the same. 
5. 
Section 12-A of the Act is reproduced below for 
reference: 
“12-A. Cases to be disposed of within a specified 
period. A Family Court shall dispose of a case, 
including a suit for dissolution marriage, within a 
period of six months from the date of institution: 
 
Provided that where a case is not disposed of within 
six months either party shall have a right to make 
an application to the High Court for necessary 
direction as the High Court may deem fit.” 
  
6. 
The Family Court in terms of the Section 12-A of 
the Act is required to decide a case within six months 

3 
WP No. 14846 of 2024 
Dated 05.11.2024 
from the date of institution which mandate is controlled 
by the proviso to the afore referred Section that if the 
case is not disposed of within six months, either party has 
a right to make an application to the High Court for 
necessary direction as the High Court may deem fit. It is 
settled by now that the proviso controls the meaning and 
scope of the main section. Generally a proviso was an 
exception to or qualified the main provision of law to 
which it was attached. Proviso was to be strictly 
construed and it applied only to the particular provision 
to which it was appended. Proviso was limited to the 
provision which immediately precedes it. Purpose of a 
proviso was to qualify or modify the scope or ambit of 
the matter dealt with in the main provision and its effect 
was restricted to the particular situation specified in the 
proviso itself. Before a proviso could have any 
application, the section or provision itself must apply. 
Reliance is placed on 2017 SCMR 339 (Collector of 
Customs Appraisement, Collectorate, Customs House, 
Karachi versus Messrs Gul Rehman, Proprietor Messrs 
G. Kin enterprises, Ghazali street, Nasir Road, Sialkot). 
7. 
In terms of Section 12-A of the Act, Family Court 
is required to decide the matter within six months and the 
afore-mentioned proviso provides right to either of the 
parties to approach the High Court for seeking necessary 
directions, if the family court does not decide the matter 
within the prescribed period. Law does not provide 
specific procedure for approaching this Court through 
writ petition or on its administrative side, hence any 
process or procedure could be adopted by the petitioner. 
Needless, to mention that every procedure which is not 

4 
WP No. 14846 of 2024 
Dated 05.11.2024 
expressly prohibited is permitted unless the same 
specifically violates any provision of law or rules in  
view of principles laid down in judgment reported as 
2003 SCMR 1026 (Additional Collector-II Sales Tax, 
Lahore versus Messrs Abdullah Sugar Mills Ltd. and 
others). Hence the office objection at Serial No. 26 of the 
objection sheet to file this petition before appropriate 
forum (i.e. Directorate of District Judiciary, Lahore High 
Court, Lahore) was not justified being in conflict with the 
express provision of law providing the petitioner remedy 
to approach this Court on its judicial or administrative 
side and the petitioner without resort to remedy before 
the said authority could directly approach this Court to 
seek direction for redress of the afore-mentioned 
grievance, hence the said objection is over ruled and this 
petition is held to be maintainable.   
8. 
As regards the grievance raised through this 
petition, in order to avoid further delay in the matter and 
while dispensing with notice to the other side, as only a 
discretionary order is required to be passed with which 
prejudice shall not be caused to any party, this Court 
deems it appropriate to issue a direction to the concerned 
family court/respondent No. 1 to expeditiously conclude 
the trial without granting unnecessary adjournments to 
either of the parties while also ensuring that prejudice is 
not caused to rights of any of the parties by keeping in 
view both the time tested principles of law that „justice 
delayed is justice denied‟ and „justice hurried is justice 
buried‟ so balance is to be struck between the two 
principles, which legal position has also been reiterated 
by the Supreme Court of Pakistan with approval in the 

5 
WP No. 14846 of 2024 
Dated 05.11.2024 
Judgment reported as 1993 SCMR 550 (Syed SAEED 
MUHAMMAD SHAH and another versus THE 
STATE). Order accordingly. 
9. 
This petition stands disposed of.
