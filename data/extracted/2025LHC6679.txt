Through instant petition under section 561-A of 
Cr.P.C., the petitioner has prayed for setting aside the order 
dated 16.04.2021 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate 
Section-30, Lahore, whereby the learned Judicial Magistrate 
Section-30, Lahore, sine die adjourned the proceedings of the 
private complaint filed by the petitioner, till the decision of the 
civil suits. The petitioner has also prayed for setting aside the 
order dated 22.12.2021, passed by the learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Lahore, whereby the criminal revision petition 
filed by the petitioner challenging the said order of the 
Magistrate was dismissed. Hence, the instant petition.  
2. 
I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by 
the learned counsel for the parties and thoroughly reviewed 
the record.  
3. 
The petitioner filed a private complaint against 
respondents No.2 & 3, with the allegations that they caused 
wrongful damage and loss through “mischief” to the property 
of the petitioner, valued at Rs.27,626,109/-. Learned 
Magistrate, after recording the cursory evidence of the 
petitioner, summoned respondents No.2 & 3 vide order dated 
03.01.2019. The trial was in progress when respondents No. 2 
& 3 filed an application under Section 249-A of the Cr.P.C. 

Crl.Misc. No.10180-M of 2022

for their acquittal. The learned Judicial Magistrate, Section 30, 
Lahore, observed that the civil court shall determine whether 
the accused/respondents committed any act which caused 
damage or loss to the complainant party in the civil suit titled 
“M/S Digital World Pakistan vs. Sohaib Ilyas Sheikh etc.” and 
“Shahjahan Bano Vs. Sohaib Ilyas, etc.” Therefore, the case 
was adjourned sine die until a decision is made on the civil 
suits. Learned counsel for the petitioner admitted that civil 
suits for damages are pending adjudication before the Civil 
Court and are at the stage of recording evidence. Although 
civil liability is independent of criminal liability and no 
invariable rule exists to the effect that the pending decision 
of a civil suit criminal proceedings must stay as it is purely a 
matter of discretion, yet, while exercising discretion, the 
guiding principle should be to see whether the accused is 
likely to be prejudiced if the criminal proceedings have not 
stayed. The petitioner mentioned in the suit titled “M/S 
Digital World Pakistan vs. Sohaib Ilyas Sheikh etc.” that Ms. 
Shah Jahan Bano is the owner of Plot No. 39-A, Sector C, 
Bahria Town, Lahore, where she constructed a commercial 
Plaza, and the petitioner took the first floor of the said plaza 
on rent. Respondent No. 1 initiated excavation of the 
foundation at a vacant plot owned by him (Respondent No. 
1) adjacent to the right side of the plaza, which led to the 
building's collapse. The petitioner filed suit for damages 
amounting to Rs. 27,417,630/- on 12-06-2018 against the 
respondents and others before the civil courts at Lahore.  
On court query, the learned counsel for the petitioner 
and learned DPG admitted that the petitioner filed a private 
complaint against the respondents under Section 200 Cr.P.C. 
for offences falling under Sections 425 and 427 of the PPC 

Crl.Misc. No.10180-M of 2022

before the Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Lahore, on 
24.05.2018.  The learned counsel for the respondent No. 2 
submitted that in the instant case, criminal liability depends 
on the outcome of the civil liability proceedings, as it has 
yet to be established that the plaza's collapse was due to 
deep excavation, which may also result in criminal liability. 
However, when it is clear that criminal liability depends on 
the outcome of civil litigation, criminal proceedings were 
rightly stayed. Learned counsel for the petitioner admitted 
that the suits for recovery of damages are pending adjudication 
before the learned Civil Courts.  
4. 
Although both sides argued the case on its merits of the 
case. Section 249 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 
does not apply to complaints under Section 200 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure 1898. There was no dispute that 
respondent No. 3 filed an application under Section 249-A, 
CrPC, for acquittal, and the trial court, sine die, adjourned the 
proceedings of the complaint filed by the petitioner till the 
decision of the civil suits vide order dated 16.04.2021. The 
trial court has no power to stay the proceedings of the 
complaint case under Section 249 of Cr.P.C., and same is 
hereby reproduced for ready reference:  
“Power 
to 
stop 
proceedings 
when 
no 
complaint. In any case instituted otherwise 
than upon complaint a Magistrate of the first 
clause, or with the previous sanction of the 
Sessions Judge, may for reasons to be recorded 
by him, stop the proceedings at any stage 
without pronouncing any judgment either of 
acquittal or conviction, and may thereupon 
release the accused”. (emphasis added). 
However, both courts below had overlooked this vital aspect 
of the case. Accordingly, impugned orders are set aside and

application under Section 249-A Cr.P.C., (mentioned above) 
would be deemed as pending and, the same would be decided 
by the learned Judicial Magistrate Section 30, Lahore after 
affording opportunity of hearing to the parties in accordance 
with law. The parties are directed to appear before the learned 
Judicial Magistrate, Section 30, Lahore, on 01.12.2025.
