Rs.10,00,000/-, thereafter; and that balance

Page-2 
 
 
ready and willing to perform his part who was 
entitled to enforce the agreement through the 
indulgence of the court as the petitioners were 
attempting to avoid the performance of contract. 
Suit was contested. Issues were framed and 
evidence got recorded. After trial, learned Civil 
Judge vide judgment dated 14.3.2023 decreed the 
suit. Appeal thereagainst of the petitioners/ 
defendants was dismissed by the learned Addl. 
District Judge, Lahore vide judgment dated 
26.6.2023. In the instant revision petition the 
judgments of the courts below are under 
challenge. 
3. 
Learned 
counsel 
for 
the 
petitioners 
submitted that the courts below only discussed 
issues No.1 to 4 and recorded their findings on 
those issues while the remaining issue Nos.5 to 7 
were not considered in the light of the evidence 
available on the file and that certain admissions 
made by PWs in cross-examination were ignored 
and that the impugned orders were legally 
untenable and that judgments of the courts below 
are result of misapplication of law which resulted 
in miscarriage of justice and that the impugned 
findings are not based on legally admissible 
evidence. Contrariwise, learned counsel for the 
respondents/plaintiffs supported the impugned 
judgments and submitted that there were clear 
admissions in the statements of DW-1 and DW-2 
as to the execution of agreement to sell and 
payment of consideration and that concurrent 
finding of fact were recorded by the courts below 
as to the execution of agreement to sell which 

    C.R. No.45106 of 2023 
 
 
 
Page-3 
 
 
were recorded after due consideration and 
appraisal of evidence and that no misreading or 
non-reading was specifically pointed out and that 
the plea of admissions or discrepancies in the 
evidence was  misconceived which had no bearing 
on the findings of the courts below and that the 
findings of fact recorded by courts below on 
correct analysis of evidence could not be expected 
to be interfered with in revisional jurisdiction by 
taking a different view of the same evidence.  
4. 
Points raised by the parties’ learned counsel 
have been duly attended and considered in the 
light of the evidence on record and the findings 
recorded by the courts below. The case of the 
respondents was that petitioners entered into an 
agreement of sale in favour of deceased Haji 
Khalid Mehmood (predecessor-in-interest of the 
respondents) on 06.8.2010 in respect of shop No. 
2 measuring 144 sq ft bearing property No. 
SXVIII-49-S-4 at ground floor of Bilal Shah 
Market, Farooq-e-Azam Bazar, Ichhra, Lahore, 
for a consideration of Rs.90,00,000/-. A sum of 
Rs.20,00,000/- was received as earnest money by 
them through cross cheque dated 06.8.2010. In 
terms of the agreement the remaining amount of 
Rs.70,00,000/- was payable at the time of 
execution of sale deed which was agreed to be 
executed within one year and three months from 
the date of sale agreement. The period was 
extended with the consent of both sides on 
06.10.2011 for two years and nine months and, 
thereafter, on petitioners’ request a further sum of 
Rs.10,00,000/- was paid to them while the 

    C.R. No.45106 of 2023 
 
 
 
Page-4 
 
 
remaining amount of Rs.60,00,000/- was agreed to 
be paid on completion of sale deed and that 
despite readiness and willing of the respondents’ 
predecessor to pay the balance amount and to get 
the sale deed executed, the petitioners adopted 
dilatory tactics and tried to avoid execution of the 
sale deed which resulted in filing of suit for  
enforcement of agreement through indulgence of 
court. Petitioners resisted the suit. Defence taken 
was that the agreement was based on fraud. There 
was no agreement of sale and that as a matter of 
fact the agreement was entered to secure the 
investment of Rs.20,00,000/- by the deceased 
respondent in the business of petitioners and that 
thereafter further investment of Rs.10,00,000/- in 
the business of petitioners was made and in view 
thereof the agreement was liable to be cancelled. 
Issues were framed and evidence was recorded by 
both sides. Late Haji Khalid Mehmood himself 
appeared as PW-1, Sh. Kamran Javaid as PW-2 
and Muhammad Afzal as PW-3. In documentary 
evidence agreement to sell was produced as 
Ex.P1, receipt of payment of Rs.10,00,000/- as 
Ex.P2 and receipt of payment of Rs.20,00,000/- as 
Ex.P3 while receipt of deposit of Rs.60,00,000/- 
as balance consideration was placed as Mark-A. 
Petitioners in response produced Sh. Muhammad 
Arif as DW-1, Muhammad Arshad as DW-2,  
Muhammad Amin as DW-3, Muhammad Mohsan 
as DW-4 and Abdul Haq as DW-5. No 
documentary evidence was produced by them. 
After giving due consideration to the oral and 
documentary evidence and the points raised pro 

    C.R. No.45106 of 2023 
 
 
 
Page-5 
 
 
and  contra, the learned Civil Judge decreed the 
suit vide judgment and decree dated 14.3.2023. 
Petitioners went in appeal which was dismissed by 
learned Addl. District Judge, Lahore vide 
impugned judgment dated 26.6.2023. 
5. 
Findings recorded by the courts below are 
that execution of Ex.P1, Ex.P2 and Ex.P3 was not 
only proved by adducing oral and documentary 
evidence but also the documents were admitted in 
the evidence of the petitioners. Perusal of the 
defence taken by the petitioners shows that the 
stance of petitioners was that in fact there was no 
sale agreement rather it was an agreement for 
investment in the business of the petitioners for 
which they were allegedly paying the profits to the 
respondents. While appearing as DW-1, petitioner 
Muhammad 
Arif, 
in 
his 
cross-examination 
admitted that agreement of sale Ex.P1 bears his 
signatures and thumb-impression and that Ex.P3 
receipt for payment of earnest money also bears 
his signatures and thumb-impression and that it is 
correct that the value of the shop was fixed at 
Rs.90,00,000/- and that as per agreement on 
payment of balance consideration Rs.60,00,000/- 
the shop was to be transferred and that he did not 
have any receipt for payment of profits to the 
respondents nor he had any receipt or writing for 
the return of money and that it was correct that he 
had thumb-marked and signed the document 
Ex.P1 
after 
reading 
it. 
DW-2, 
petitioner 
Muhammad Arshad, in his cross-examination 
admitted that it was correct that his signature and 
thumb-impression existed on Ex.P1 i.e. the 

    C.R. No.45106 of 2023 
 
 
 
Page-6 
 
 
agreement of sale and that the signatures and 
thumb-impression are also available on Ex.P3, the 
document regarding payment of earnest money 
and that he could not produce any document to 
prove his claim about the return of money. He 
admitted that he did not make any application to 
the police regarding their defence taken in the 
written statement about the document. DW-4 
Muhammad Mohsin produced by the petitioners, 
was not a witness to the document. Be that as it 
may, he admitted in cross-examination that 
agreement Ex.P1 did not bear his signatures and 
thumb-impression nor he was present at the time 
of drafting of the document Ex.P1 or at the time of 
signing the same by Muhammad Arif and 
Muhammad Arshad petitioners and that the 
alleged payment of Rs.10,00,000/- was not made 
in his presence. Same was the position of the 
statement of Abdul Haq DW-5 who admitted that 
he was a salesman and that the document Ex.P1 
did not bear his signatures or thumb-impression 
nor he was present at the time of payment of 
Rs.20,00,000/- or at the time of execution and that 
the 
document 
reflecting 
payment 
of 
Rs.10,00,000/- was not written in his presence nor 
it bore his signatures and thumb-impression. It is 
manifest from the evidence of the petitioners that 
they did not deny the execution of agreement 
Ex.P1 or Ex.P2 and Ex.P3 and also that document 
pertained to the sale and transfer of property and 
that they received the payment of the amount as 
claimed by the respondent in terms of Ex.P1, 
Ex.P2 and Ex.P3. They also admitted that they 

    C.R. No.45106 of 2023 
 
 
 
Page-7 
 
 
have no proof in support of defence that the 
arrangement between the parties was in regard to 
the investment in their business or that they had 
been paying the profits to the respondent or that 
the amount received by them was returned. It is 
also in their evidence that the respondent did not 
make any complaint/application  to the police for 
some action in respect of the plea qua the 
document. The petitioners were unable to prove 
their counter-version in regard to document Ex.P1. 
As against the petitioners, the evidence of 
respondent comprised of PW-1 Haji Khalid 
Mehmood, PW-2 Sh. Kamran Javaid and PW-3  
Muhammad Afzal.  In documentary evidence 
agreement to sell Ex.P1, receipt for payment  of 
Rs.10,00,000/- as Ex.P2, and receipt of payment 
Rs.20,00,000/- as Ex.P3 were produced and 
receipt for payment/deposit in court of the 
remaining amount of Rs.60,00,000/- was adduced 
as Mark A. PW-1, plaintiff in the case, deposed 
that he entered into agreement Ex.P1 to purchase 
the property and paid Rs.20,00,000/- through 
cheque and Rs.10,00,000/- thereafter and that he 
had deposited the balance sale price in the court. 
He also deposed that he always remained ready 
and willing to perform his part but the sale deed 
could not be executed due to the evasive 
attitude/conduct of the petitioners and that the 
stance of investment in business was based on 
falsehood. His statement was cross-examined but 
nothing adverse could be extracted therefrom. 
Same was the position of PW-2 and PW-3 who 
were the marginal witnesses of agreement Ex.P1 

    C.R. No.45106 of 2023 
 
 
 
Page-8 
 
 
and deposed in support of respondent’s stance and 
in this way the execution of document of sale 
agreement and payment of consideration were 
proved by the respondent. 
6. 
It is discernible from the evidence that the 
respondent did prove the execution of agreement 
of sale Ex.P1 and the documents showing 
payment thereagainst by producing two marginal 
witnesses. Their statements could not be shaken in 
cross-examination. As against the plaintiff the 
petitioner defendants not only admitted the 
execution of document Ex.P1 in their written 
statement but also in their statements as DW-1 and 
DW-2. Perusal of the defence taken in paragraph 1 
of the preliminary objections of the written 
statement reveals that petitioners admitted that at 
the time of execution of document they did take 
notice of the fact that the document pertained to 
sale of property and not as a security to protect the 
alleged investment in business. Despite that the 
petitioners executed the document, admitted the 
receipt of payment thereagainst and did not 
challenge the document by filing any suit or 
through a complaint/application to the police as 
admitted in their evidence. So much so no notice 
for raising this objection was claimed to have been 
sent. The conduct of the petitioners is manifest 
from the facts which give no other impression 
except that the document is an agreement of sale, 
its contents leave no room for doubt that the 
petitioners agreed to sell the property and received 
compensation as mentioned in Ex.P1, Ex.P2 and 
Ex.P3. Plea raised in the written statement about 

    C.R. No.45106 of 2023 
 
 
 
Page-9 
 
 
the nature of document as security appears to be 
afterthought and, as such, inadmissible and also 
impermissible as per Articles 102, 103 and 104 of 
the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984. Article 102 
contemplates that when the terms of a contract or 
of grant or of any other disposition  of property 
have been reduced to the form of a document no 
evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of 
such contract, grant or other disposition of 
property, or of such matter, except the document 
itself or secondary evidence of its contents in 
cases  in which secondary evidence is admissible. 
Article 103 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
provides that the terms of any such contract, grant 
or other disposition of property or any matter 
required by law to be reduced to the form of a 
document, have been proved according to the last 
above-noted provision of law, no evidence  of any 
oral agreement or statement shall be admitted as 
between the parties to an instrument or their 
representative-in-interest, for the purpose of 
contradicting, varying, adding, or subtracting 
from, its terms. Article 104 of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984 provides that when language used in 
a document is plain in itself and when it applied 
accurately to existing facts, evidence may not be 
given to show that it was not meant to apply to 
such facts. 
7. 
It is manifest from the provisions of law 
referred supra that where the parties to the 
transaction reduced the terms and conditions of an 
agreement in the form of document, then the 
document itself is the only evidence and no oral 

    C.R. No.45106 of 2023 
 
 
 
Page-10 
 
 
evidence can be adduced to add, vary, subtract or 
modify the terms thereof. For the purpose of 
understanding the real intent of the parties therein 
only the document itself is deemed to be final and 
no oral evidence can contradict or vary the same 
and that the parties are bound by the terms as 
specified in the document. Reference in this 
regard can be made to Muhammad Tufail and 3 
others v. Muhammad Aslam Khan and another 
(1999 YLR 934) and Zaheer Uddin Pathan 
through Legal Heirs and 8 others v. Mst. Hajiani 
Zainab through Legal Heirs and another (1999 
YLR 728) wherein it was observed that oral 
evidence, contradicting the terms of written 
instrument, is inadmissible under Article 103 of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984. In view of the rule 
supra, it is manifest that the plea taken by the 
petitioners in defence was not only inadmissible in 
law but also not proved in accordance with law 
and that they were estopped by their conduct to 
raise such plea. To the contrary the respondent 
had proved the agreement of sale and payment of 
earnest money and subsequent payments thereof 
as also the readiness and willingness to perform 
their part and were therefore entitled to the 
enforcement of the agreement through the 
indulgence of the court.  
8. 
Perusal of the judgments of the courts 
below also reveals that the entire evidence of both 
sides as was relevant and material was duly 
scrutinized and it was only after indepth 
consideration of the evidence that the conclusion 
drawn was that execution of agreement and 

    C.R. No.45106 of 2023 
 
 
 
Page-11 
 
 
receipt of payment of earnest money were not 
only admitted in the pleadings and the evidence 
but were also proved in accordance with law and 
that the respondents were entitled to the grant of 
decree in the suit. No misreading or non-reading 
of evidence or any material discrepancy therein 
could be highlighted in the course of hearing of 
the petition which could vitiate the findings of the 
courts below. No ground for interference could be 
made out in the concurrent findings of fact in the 
circumstances. Revision petition is devoid of 
substance and is dismissed.
