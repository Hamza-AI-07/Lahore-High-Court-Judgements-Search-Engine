Rasaal Hasan Syed, J. This judgment will decide the 
instant civil revision as well as civil revision No.21353 of 
2021 against consolidated judgment and decree dated 
04.3.2021 of the learned Addl. District Judge, Kot Radha 
Kishan, District Kasur, wherein by allowing appeals of the 
respondents against consolidated judgment and decree dated 
22.4.2016 of the learned Civil Judge, suit for specific 
performance of the petitioners was dismissed while the suit 
for declaration, cancellation and injunction filed by the 
respondents was decreed. 
2. 
Facts material for the disposal of these petitions are that 
the predecessor of petitioners instituted a suit for specific 
performance titled Barkat Ali v. Ramzan, etc.  to enforce 
agreement of sale dated 31.7.1996 while the respondents filed 
a suit for declaration, cancellation and injunction titled 

C.R. No.19540 of 2021

Rasheed Ahmad v. Barkat Ali, etc.. The suits were contested 
by the respective parties, consolidated issues were framed, 
oral and documentary evidence pro and contra was produced, 
whereafter the learned Civil Judge,  Kot Radha Kishan, 
District Kasur vide judgment and decree dated 22.4.2016 
dismissed the suit for declaration filed by the respondents and 
decreed the suit of the petitioners for specific performance 
against the respondents except the minor defendant (defendant 
No.4 in the suit). Two appeals were filed against the 
consolidated judgment which were allowed by the learned 
Addl. District Judge, Kot Radha Kishan, District Kasur in 
terms whereof the petitioners’ suit for specific performance 
was dismissed in toto while the suit of the respondents for 
declaration with consequential relief was decreed. In the 
instant petitions, the consolidated judgment of the learned 
Addl. District Judge has been assailed.  
3. 
Petitioners’ learned counsel submits that the judgment 
of the appellate court was based on misconception of law and 
facts; that the learned Civil Judge partly decreed the suit for 
specific performance and dismissed the suit for declaration 
filed by the respondents for sound legal reasons while the 
appellate court illegally and by misreading the record reversed 
the findings of trial court; that the execution of agreement was 
proved beyond doubt by oral evidence and also the 
admissions of witness of respondents in cross-examination 

C.R. No.19540 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
Page-3 
 
 
 
were illegally ignored and that non-appearance of attesting 
witnesses of the agreement was not fatal in the peculiar 
circumstances of case; and that the impugned judgment of the 
appellate court is without jurisdiction. In response the learned 
counsel for the respondents supported the impugned judgment 
and submitted that the suit for specific performance was 
rightly dismissed  as the petitioners could not prove the 
execution and genuineness of any sale agreement and that the 
oral and documentary evidence proved beyond doubt that the 
petitioners were lessee in the property which was leased out 
for ten years and who were bound to return the possession and 
that the learned Addl. District Judge correctly analyzed the 
evidence and rightly held that the petitioners could not prove 
the sale transaction and that the suit of the petitioners was 
justifiably dismissed. 
4.  
Points raised by the learned counsel for the parties pro 
and contra have been given due consideration in the light of 
pleadings and evidence annexed with the petitions. Facts as 
are discernible therefrom are that petitioners’ predecessor 
instituted a suit for specific performance for enforcement of 
agreement of sale dated 31.7.1996 against the respondents 
claiming that the respondents executed an agreement of sale 
in his favour in respect of the suit land whereby the land was 
agreed to be sold for Rs. 83,125/-; a sum of Rs. 78,125/- was 
paid as earnest money; it was settled that sale deed would be 

C.R. No.19540 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
Page-4 
 
 
 
executed on acquisition of proprietary rights as the property at 
that time was vesting in the Provincial Government and that 
the possession was delivered under the sale and that despite 
repeated requests matter pertaining final sale was avoided  on 
different pretexts;  thereafter the respondents refused to honor 
their commitments, in result, the suit was filed for 
enforcement of agreement through the indulgence of the 
Court. As against this, the respondents denied the claim and 
also filed a suit for declaration, cancellation and perpetual 
injunction titled Rasheed Ahmad v. Barkat Ali, etc. seeking 
annulment of the document i.e. agreement of sale dated 
31.7.1996. The defence taken was that in point of fact the land 
was leased out for ten years in favour of late Barkat Ali and 
that he in collusion  and in conspiracy with the stamp-
vendor/deed-writer fabricated a sale agreement instead of 
lease agreement and that the respondents never executed any 
agreement of sale. Both suits were consolidated on 
20.10.2015, consolidated issues were framed; parties led their 
evidence. Barkat Ali plaintiff testified as P.W.1, Muhammad 
Hayat son of Ameer Khan appeared as P.W.2 and Muhammad 
Ilyas son of Ameer Khan deposed as P.W.3. Documentary 
evidence comprised sale agreement as Ex.P-1,  mutation No. 
1960 as Ex.P-2,  mutation No. 1958 as Ex.P-3,   mutation No. 
1959 as Ex.P-4 and copy of entry at serial No. 28 of the 
stamp-vendor’s register as Ex.P-5. Respondents produced 

C.R. No.19540 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
Page-5 
 
 
 
Rasheed Ahmad son of  Shahada as D.W.1, Bashir Ahmad 
son of Muhammad Hayat as D.W.2 and Salamat Ali son of 
Mehtab Khan as D.W.3. Documentary evidence produced 
included attested copy of mutation No. 1203 as Ex.D-1, 
attested copy of mutation No. 1958 as Ex.D-2, attested copy 
of mutation No. 1959 as Ex.D-3 and attested copy of mutation 
No. 1960 as Ex.D-4. The learned Civil Judge decreed the suit 
for specific performance filed by the petitioners against 
respondents except Mst. Umran minor daughter of Hafeezan 
Bibi (defendant No.4 in the suit and respondent No.4 in the 
first appeal) and dismissed the suit for declaration filed by the 
respondents by consolidated judgment and decree dated  
22.4.2016 which was challenged in two separate appeals: one 
filed by Rasheed Ahmad respondent titled Rasheed Ahmad v. 
Barkat Ali, etc.  and the other filed by Ramzan, etc. titled 
Ramzan, etc. v. Barkat Ali, etc. These appeals were accepted 
by the learned Addl. District Judge, Kot Radha Kishan, 
District Kasur vide impugned judgment dated 04.3.2021, in 
result, the judgment and decree of the trial court were set 
aside, suit for specific performance filed by the petitioners 
was dismissed while the suit for declaration and cancellation 
of agreement filed by the respondents was decreed. 
5.  
In view of the fact that the judgments of the courts 
below were at variance, the entire evidence as also the 
reasoning recorded by two courts were minutely analyzed. 

C.R. No.19540 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
Page-6 
 
 
 
Admittedly, the petitioners’ predecessor Barkat Ali filed a suit 
on 03.2.2011 for specific performance of an agreement dated 
31.7.1996 i.e. after approximately 15 years, wherein it was 
claimed that respondents had entered into an agreement to sell 
suit property for Rs. 83,125/-, executed the agreement in the 
presence of witnesses, received the earnest money of 
Rs.78,125/- and committed to execute the sale deed after 
acquiring proprietary rights from the Provincial Government. 
As against this the defence taken in the written statement as 
well as in the suit for cancellation of document was that  no 
sale agreement was ever executed; that they had never agreed 
to sell their property to the petitioners’ predecessor and that 
the document had been fabricated by fraud in collusion and 
conspiracy with the stamp-vendor/deed-writer and that the 
land was leased out for ten years and on the expiry thereof the 
same had to be returned to the respondents and that the land 
was inherited by the respondents. Later some of the 
respondents transferred their share in favour of Rasheed 
Ahmad respondent/plaintiff in suit titled Rasheed Ahmad v. 
Barkat Ali, etc. vide mutation Nos. 1958, 1959 and 1960 
dated 30.6.2008 and that the petitioners were only tenant in 
the property. 
6. 
Since the petitioners filed the suit for specific 
performance of agreement dated 31.7.1996 and claimed  a 
sale purchase arrangement with respondents and prayed for 

C.R. No.19540 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
Page-7 
 
 
 
the relief of specific performance to enforce the said 
agreement through the indulgence of court, which plea was 
denied by the respondents, it was for the petitioners/plaintiffs 
to prove the existence and execution of sale agreement, the 
settlement of terms and conditions of the sale and other 
prerequisites in terms of Articles 17 and 79 of Qanun-e-
Shahdat Order, 1984 which mandated to the effect that if a 
document is required by law to be attested it shall not be used 
as evidence until two attesting witness at least have been 
called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be two 
attesting witnesses alive and subject to the process of the 
court and capable of giving evidence.  Perusal of the 
agreement Ex.P-1 shows that the marginal witnesses who 
attested the same were Chanan Din son of Chohr Ali and 
Shahtab Khan, Lumberdar. It was mandatory for the 
petitioners to produce them as witnesses to prove the 
document. Perusal of the agreement Ex.P-1 shows that the 
alleged bargain of sale and execution of document including 
transfer of possession allegedly took place in the presence of 
the marginal/attesting witnesses named supra and no other 
person was claimed to be present either at the time of 
settlement of bargain or at the time of execution of  document, 
therefore, the production of these two persons cited as 
marginal witnesses was necessary. They were not produced as 
such Ex. P-1 could not be deemed to be admissible in 

C.R. No.19540 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
Page-8 
 
 
 
evidence or have been proved as the said provisions of law 
being mandatory no exception could be taken thereto. 
Petitioners produced Muhammad Hayat and Muhammad Ilyas 
sons of Ameer Khan as P.W.2 and P.W.3 in an attempt to 
prove the transaction of sale and also the execution of 
agreement but in view of the peculiar facts of this case their 
testimony was inadmissible apart from being a false 
concoction.  Perusal of the plaint in suit for specific 
performance reveals that the case of the petitioner in 
paragraph 2 thereof  was that “the bargain of sale by the 
defendants was settled for Rs. 83,125/-; the alleged agreement 
dated 31.7.1996 was executed; earnest money of Rs. 78,125/- 
was received in the presence of marginal witnesses and 
possession of land was delivered  to the plaintiff; that the 
agreement was read over in the presence of marginal 
witnesses and same was thumb marked in their presence”. No 
other person was claimed to be present or involved in the deal 
or alleged to have knowledge of the transaction. The 
assertions in paragraph 2 of the plaint supra were in line with 
the contents of the document Ex.P-1. In this view of the 
matter the statement of these two witnesses namely Chanan 
Din and Shahtab Lumberdar were most essential in this case 
to prove the settlement of transaction/bargain, payment of 
alleged earnest money, transfer of possession and execution of 
the document. No effort was made to produce these two 

C.R. No.19540 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
Page-9 
 
 
 
witnesses instead Muhammad Hayat and Muhammad Ilyas 
sons of Ameer Khan  were produced as P.W.2 and P.W.3 who 
did not find mention either in the agreement of sale Ex.P-1 or 
in the pleadings/plaint. It is settled rule that on the facts 
neither pleaded nor incorporated in the plaint, no evidence 
shall be allowed to be led to prove such facts and that the 
evidence can be led on facts founded in the pleadings only. It 
is also a rule that no party can be permitted to lead evidence 
different from the facts mentioned in the plaint and even if 
such evidence comes on record the same could not be 
considered or looked into being inadmissible and against the 
rule secundum allegata et probata. Reference can be made to 
Muhammad Ghaffar (deceased) through LRs and others v. 
Arif Muhammad (2023 SCMR 344), Messrs Chaudhry 
Brothers Limited, Sialkot v. The Jaranwala Central Co-
operative Bank Ltd, Jaranwala and others (1968 SCMR 804), 
Mst. Jannat Bibi v. Sher Muhammad and others (1988 SCMR 
1696) and Major (Retd.) Barkat Ali and others v. Qaim Din 
and others (2006 SCMR 562). In view of the rule supra the 
statements of P.W. 2 and P.W.3 raising a plea which had no 
foundation in the plaint was inadmissible and could not be 
looked into. Even otherwise P.W.2 and P.W.3 could not prove 
their presence at the time of alleged agreement by reference to 
the document itself or any other correspondence between the 

C.R. No.19540 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
Page-10 
 
 
 
parties. Their statements, as such, smacked of concoction and 
being so were unworthy of consideration. 
7. 
Another important fact in respect of Ex.P-1 was that the 
petitioners’ stance was that it was a “transaction of sale” and 
that it was not a “lease” while the respondents’ defense was 
that it was a “lease” which was agreed between the parties and 
that the petitioners in conspiracy with the stamp-vendor/deed-
writer concocted the plea of sale in the document taking 
benefit of the illiteracy of the respondents. In this view of the 
matter, it was the statement of stamp-vendor/deed-writer 
which was necessary to unfold the events as they took place 
and to depose as to the nature of the transaction agreed 
between the parties. To succeed in their case for enforcement 
of sale agreement the petitioners were required as a matter of 
law to produce the deed-writer/stamp-vendor in their evidence 
as they were beneficiary of the agreement and would 
obviously fail if material evidence is withheld particularly 
when some of the executants of the alleged documents were 
claimed to be females and belonged to rural area and were 
also illiterate. No explanation whatsoever could be given for 
non-production of the witnesses who were most material to 
establishing 
the 
case 
which 
raises 
serious 
adverse 
presumption against the petitioners. 
8. 
As  regards the nature of possession of land, the 
petitioner as P.W.1 admitted in cross-examination that his  

C.R. No.19540 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
Page-11 
 
 
 
entry in the revenue record was that of a lessee and did not 
claim to be an intending buyer. The witness P.W.3 
Muhammad Ilyas also admitted that in the revenue record the 
status of the petitioner was recorded as tenant. Petitioners 
claimed transfer of possession under the sale but could not 
produce any document from the revenue hierarchy to show 
that the entry in the revenue record was not as a lessee but as 
an intending buyer  i.e., possession as baa-tasawar baee. 
9. 
Another important fact is that the agreement was 
claimed to have been executed by defendant No.4 Mst. Umran 
daughter of Hafeezan Bibi who was a minor and against 
whom the suit was dismissed by both the courts below. 
Perusal of the agreement Ex.P-1 shows that her name was 
inserted as “Mst. Umran walda Hafeezan Bibi” which creates 
a doubt as to whether the agreement was being executed by 
Mst. Umran or by Hafeezan Bibi. Same name was also 
inserted in the title of plaint where she was reflected as “Mst. 
Umran  walda Hafeezan Bibi”  defendant No. 4. However, 
later the plaint was amended after the filing of written 
statement and her proper particulars were given and reflected 
as Mst. Umran minor daughter through mother Hafeezan Bibi. 
The contract of sale by a minor being legally untenable to 
cover up the fraud, the petitioners in the evidence raised a new 
plea to the effect that the mother of minor had promised to  
get the sale deed concluded by getting a guardianship 

C.R. No.19540 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
Page-12 
 
 
 
certificate which was not the plea in the plaint or in the 
agreement and was thus inadmissible. This factual state of 
affairs also supported the version of the respondents in 
defense to the effect that the thumb-impressions were 
obtained on a blank paper which were affixed being simple 
minded and having trust upon the petitioners and that this 
trust was misused to  insert sale. The learned Civil Judge did 
not accept the plea of the petitioners qua defendant No.4  and 
dismissed the suit to the extent of the minor. 
10. 
Another noteworthy fact is that suit was brought after 
about fifteen years i.e. on 03.2.2011, as the agreement was 
statedly executed on 31.7.1996. No correspondence was 
produced  or claimed to have been made during this period 
with the respondents for the transfer of property. The inaction 
of the petitioners for such a long period raises serious doubts 
about the case set up in the plaint and was therefore, rightly 
disbelieved. Even otherwise the respondents produced  
documentary evidence  Ex.D-1 to Ex.D-4, which are copies of 
mutation of inheritance and sale. Ex.D-1 is the mutation of 
inheritance dated 16.12.1993 whereby the land was mutated 
in the name of respondents as successors of Shah Muhammad 
alias Shahrah (Sardar alias Shahra). Ex.D-2 to Ex.D-4  which 
were also produced in evidence as Ex.P-2 to Ex.P-4 by the 
petitioners/plaintiffs as share of the female respondents, 
purchase and transfer in favour of respondent No.1/Rasheed 

C.R. No.19540 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
Page-13 
 
 
 
Ahmad and mutation attested on 30.6.2008. The fact that the 
sale of rights was permissible would show that if there had 
been any agreement of sale with the predecessor of the 
petitioners, he could have pressed for the enforcement thereof. 
His silence over the matter for more than 14 years supports 
the stance of respondents when they alleged that the “lease” 
was for ten years and that on the expiry of the “lease” the 
petitioners were asked for the vacation of property who made 
lame excuses and thereafter refused to return the property and 
concocted the story of sale for filing a frivolous suit. 
11. 
As regards the argument of alleged admission in the 
statement of D.W.3, the same is devoid of any substance. It 
appears that in response to the misleading suggestion in cross-
examination the witness responded as to the agreement 
between the parties but at the same time he clarified that it 
was a “lease” and that the amount paid was “lease money” for 
ten years. It is a settled rule that the statement of the witness 
has to be read as a whole for proper construal and in this case 
careful reading of the entire statement of D.W. 3 leaves no 
doubt that the witness stated about the agreement of lease and 
payment of lease money and vehemently controverted the plea 
of sale. The objection therefore is misconceived and 
untenable. 
12. 
The circumstances noted supra establish beyond doubt 
that the findings recorded by the court of first appeal in the 

C.R. No.19540 of 2021 
 
 
 
 
Page-14 
 
 
 
impugned judgment, are based on correct analysis of evidence 
and are in accordance with law and no misreading or 
nonreading of any specific part of evidence could be pointed 
out. The conclusions drawn in the impugned judgment are 
legally justified and no ground is made out for interference 
therein. 
13. 
Resultantly, the instant revision petition as well as civil 
revision No.21353 of 2021 titled Zafar Ali and others v. 
Ramzan and others are hereby dismissed.
