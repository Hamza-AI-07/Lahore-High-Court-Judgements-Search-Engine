ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J.  This Election Appeal is 
directed under Section 63 of the Elections Act, 2017 (Act) against 
the order dated 22.03.2023 (impugned order), passed by the 
Returning Officer of PP-77,Sargodha-VI, Punjab, (Returning 
Officer), whereby the nomination papers of the appellant were 
rejected.  
2. 
 
The relevant facts are that appellant contested the election 
of PP-34 in the year 2008 and was elected as a member of Punjab 
Assembly. His rival candidate (Mrs. Nadia Aziz) filed an election 
petition before the learned Election Tribunal, Lahore mainly on the 
ground that appellant does not possess the requisite qualification i.e. 
graduation to contest the election. The said election petition was 

 
 
Election Appeal No.24144/2023                                                 2 
 
 
accepted by the learned Election Tribunal vide order dated 
28.05.2010 and it was held that the graduation certificate appears to 
be fabricated and fictitious and, therefore, the appellant does not 
possess the requisite qualification i.e. graduation. Consequently, the 
election of the appellant was declared to be null and void and his 
seat had fallen vacant to be filled in through fresh election by the 
Election Commission of Pakistan. The said judgment was upheld by 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide judgment dated 14.06.2010 and the 
Election Commission was further directed to initiate action against 
all such persons who were accused of commission of corrupt 
practices, of committing forgery and of using as genuine, documents 
which they knew or at least had reason to believe to be forged. 
Consequently, FIR No.8 dated 08.01.2011 was registered against the 
appellant and in trial vide judgment dated 02.04.2013, the appellant 
was convicted. However, appeal filed by the appellant was accepted 
in toto by the learned Division Bench of this Court on 11.03.2019 
and he was acquitted of the charges in FIR No.8/2011. The 
nomination papers of the appellant for the upcoming provincial 
elections of 2023 for PP-74, Sargodha-VI have been rejected 
through impugned order dated 22.03.2023, hence, this appeal.  
3. 
 
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that as there is 
no declaration against the appellant under Article 62 (1) (f) of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (Constitution), 
therefore, the appellant is not disqualified for lifetime to contest the 

 
 
Election Appeal No.24144/2023                                                 3 
 
 
election. He further submits that when the appellant was acquitted 
by the learned Division Bench of this Court on 11.03.2019, the 
allegations of preparing forged documents and corrupt practice are 
not proved against the appellant. He adds that gradation being no 
more the minimum qualification, it is not relevant whether the 
graduation certificate was or not a genuine document though the 
learned Division Bench in judgment dated 11.03.2019 already held 
that same is a genuine document as per the University record.  
4. 
 
Learned counsel for the respondent No.3, on the other 
hand, supported the impugned order, however, despite notice no 
one entered appearance on behalf of respondent No.2 to contest this 
appeal.  
5. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. Article 62 (1) (f) of 
the Constitution being relevant to the moot issue is reproduced 
hereunder:- 
62(1)   A person shall not be qualified to be elected or chosen as 
 
a member of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) unless:-  
 
(f) 
“he is sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and 
 
ameen, there being no declaration to the contrary by a 
 
court of law;” 
 
 
 
Under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution, a person shall 
not be qualified to be elected or chosen as a member of Parliament 
unless he is sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen, 
there being no declaration to the contrary by a Court of law. In the 
instant matter, the appellant contested the election of PP-34 in the 
year 2008 and was declared a returned candidate, however, he was 

 
 
Election Appeal No.24144/2023                                                 4 
 
 
de-seated by the learned Election Tribunal vide judgment dated 
28.05.2010 on the ground that his graduation certificate appeared to 
be fabricated and, therefore, he does not possess the requisite 
qualification of graduation. The said judgment was also upheld by 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan vide judgment dated 
14.06.2010. However, no specific declaration was made in the said 
judgments under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution to the effect 
that the appellant is not sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest 
and ameen.  
6. 
 
The relevant case law shows that whenever a person is 
required to be disqualified under Article 62 (1) (f) of the 
Constitution by the Court, a specific declaration in this regard is to 
be made. For ready reference, some of the judgments passed by the 
August Supreme Court of Pakistan where such declaration was 
made are mentioned as under:- 
(i)  
In “MUHAMMAD HANIF ABBASI Vs. JAHANGIR 
KHAN TAREEN” (PLD 2018 Supreme Court 114), the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan passed the declaration under Article 
62 (1) (f) of the Constitution in following terms:- 
“Therefore, on account of the above, we hold and 
declare that in view of our findings on the proposition 
about the off-shore company (in short) covered by 
clause (e) of the conclusion, the respondent is 
disqualified in terms of Article 62 (1) (f) of the 
Constitution read with section 99 (1) (f) of ROPA for 
the non-declaration of his property/asset i.e. “Hyde 
House” in his nomination papers, and in making 
untrue statement before this Court, that he has no 
beneficial interest in SVL, therefore, he should cease 

 
 
Election Appeal No.24144/2023                                                 5 
 
 
to hold the office as the member of the National 
Assembly with immediate effect. This petition is 
accordingly allowed.”  
 
 
 
(ii)  
In “IMRAN AHMAD KHAN and others Vs. Mian 
MUHAMMAD NAWAZ SHARIF PRIME MINISTER OF 
PAKISTAN” (PLD 2017 Supreme Court 692), the declaration 
was made in the following manner:- 
“It is hereby declared that having failed to disclose his 
un-withdrawn receivables constituting assets from 
Capital FZE, Jebel Ali, UAE in his nomination papers 
filed for the General Elections held in 2013 in terms of 
Section 12(2)(f) of the Representation of the People 
Act, 1976 (ROPA), and having furnished a false 
declaration under solemn affirmation respondent No.1 
Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif is not honest in terms 
of section 99(f) of ROPA and under Article 62 (1) (f) of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, therefore, he is disqualified to be a member of 
the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament).”  
 
(iii)  
In “IMRAN AHMAD KHAN NIAZI Vs. MIAN 
MUHAMMAD NAWAZ SHARIF, PRIME MINISTER OF 
PAKISTAN/MEMBER NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, PRIME 
MINISTER‟S HOUSE ISLAMABAD and 9 others” (PLD 
2017 Supreme Court 265), the following declaration were 
issued by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan:- 
“As a consequence of the declaration issued regarding 
lack of honesty on the part of respondent No.1 the said 
respondent has become disqualified from being a 
member of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) in terms 
of Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution and section 
99(1)(f) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 
and, therefore, he is liable to be denotified by the 
Election Commission of Pakistan as a member of the 
National Assembly forthwith with a consequence that 
he ceases to be the Prime Minister of Pakistan from 
the date of denotification.”  

 
 
Election Appeal No.24144/2023                                                 6 
 
 
 
 
 
(iv)  
In “MUHAMMAD IJAZ AHMAD CHDUDHRY Vs. 
MUMTAZ AHMAD TARAR and others” (2016 SCMR 01), the 
disqualification of Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution was 
applied in the following terms:- 
“The upshot of above discussion is that the appellant 
intentionally 
misrepresented 
his 
educational 
qualification in his nomination paper and thereby 
made false statement which fails him in meeting the 
qualification prescribed in Article 62(1)(f) of the 
Constitution. His election as member National 
Assembly from constituency NA-108 Mandi Bahauddin 
is illegal and void. The making of a false statement or 
submitting a false or incorrect declaration in a 
nomination paper filed by a candidate also amounts to 
the offence of „corrupt practices‟ under section 78 
(3)(d) of the ROPA. In the cases wherein returned 
candidates had made a false statement in nomination 
papers about their educational qualification, this 
Court has directed action by the Election Commission 
of Pakistan under section 78 of the ROPA. Reference 
may be made to Najeeb-ud-Din Owaisi v. Amir Yar 
(2011 SCMR 180). The Election Commission of 
Pakistan is accordingly directed to commence 
proceedings for the prosecution of the appellant for 
the commission of offence under section 78 of the 
ROPA.”  
(Emphasis supplied).  
 
7. 
 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Sardar YAR 
MUHAMMAD RIND Vs. ELECTION TRIBUNAL BALOCHISTAN, 
QUETTA and others” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 137), held that 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution requires that disqualification of 
an election candidate must be founded on a declaration by a Court 
of law that such person is “not honest” and any judicial declaration 
must necessarily be based on evidence, oral or documentary. In 
“ALLAH DINO KHAN BHAYO Vs. ELECTION COMMISSION OF 

 
 
Election Appeal No.24144/2023                                                 7 
 
 
PAKISTAN and others” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 591), the apex 
Court held that a disqualification under Article 62 (1) (f) of the 
Constitution can only be imposed by or under a declaration made 
by a Court of law. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
“ROSHAN ALI BURIRO Vs. Syed MURAD ALI SHAH and others” 
(2019 SCMR 1939) held that declaration under Article 62 (1) (f) of 
the Constitution cannot be issued by the Returning Officer but only 
a Court of law can issue a declaration of disqualification. In “SAMI 
ULLAH 
BALOCH 
and 
others 
Vs. 
ABDUL 
KARIM 
NOUSHERWANI and others” (PLD 2018 Supreme Court 405), it 
is held that incapacity cast upon a candidate for election under 
Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution to be contingent upon an 
adverse declaration by a Court of law being made against the 
candidate. The similar view was also expressed in “ISHAQ KHAN 
KHAKWANI and others Vs. MIAN MUHAMMAD NAWAZ SHARIF 
and others” (PLD 2015 Supreme Court 275), “Rana AFTAB 
AHMAD KHAN Vs. MUHAMMAD AJMAL and another” (PLD 
2010 
Supreme 
Court 
1066), 
“FAZAL 
MEHMOOD 
Vs. 
GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN and others” (2018 CLC 1664), 
“MUHAMMAD NAWAZ KHAN Vs. ELECTION COMMISSION OF 
PAKISTAN through Secretary and 5 others” (2018 CLC 784), 
“Raja PERVAIZ ASHRAF Vs. ELECTION TRIBUNAL and others” 
(PLD 2013 Lahore 552), “MUHAMMAD JAMEEL Vs. AMIR YAR 
and 6 others” (PLD 2010 Lahore 583) and “FATAHULLAH 

 
 
Election Appeal No.24144/2023                                                 8 
 
 
KHAN Vs. IKRAMULLAH KHAN GANDAPUR and others” (2014 
CLC 1725).  
8. 
 
From the above case laws, it is manifest that where a 
person is to be disqualified under Article 62 (1) (f) of the 
Constitution, a specific order or declaration was passed by the 
learned Courts, however, the order passed by the learned Election 
Tribunal dated 28.05.2010 shows that no such declaration was 
made in respect of the appellant. No doubt, the said judgment of the 
learned Election Tribunal was upheld by the August Supreme Court 
of Pakistan on 14.06.2010 but even in such judgment, no such 
specific declaration under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution was 
passed against the appellant but general directions were issued to 
the Election Commission to initiate criminal proceedings against all 
such persons who were accused of commission of corrupt practices 
or committing forgery. The said general observations cannot be 
treated as declaration against the appellant under Article 62 (1) (f) 
of the Constitution to debar him for lifetime to contest the elections.  
9. 
 
It is not out of place to refer the judgment “Ch. BILAL 
IJAZ Vs. MUDASSAR QAYYUM NAHRA and 4 others” (2010 CLC 
1692), passed by the learned Election Tribunal regarding general 
election of 2008, in which similar allegations of fake degrees were 
leveled against the elected member which was allowed and in said 
judgment beside de-seating him it was specifically declared that he 
is neither righteous nor honest and ameen in terms of under Article 

 
 
Election Appeal No.24144/2023                                                 9 
 
 
62 (1) (f) of the Constitution. However, no such specific declaration 
was passed by the learned Election Tribunal in respect of the 
appellant, though his matter also pertains to general election 2008.  
10. 
 
It is also settled law that election laws more particularly 
disqualification provisions to disenfranchising a candidate, thus 
depriving him of a valuable right of franchise guaranteed under the 
Constitution are to be strictly construed and any ambiguity is to be 
resolved in favour of candidate who could be permitted to 
participate in the electoral process. Reliance in this regard is placed 
on “MUHAMMAD MUJTABA ABDULLAH and another Vs. 
APPELLATE AUTHORITY/ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE 
TEHSIL LIAQUATPUR DISTRICT RAHIM YAR KHAN and 
others” (2016 SCMR 893). In the light of aforesaid rule of 
interpretation, when there is no specific declaration under Article 
62 (1) (f) of the Constitution against the appellant in the judgment 
dated 28.05.2010, passed by the learned Election Tribunal and 
judgment dated 14.06.2010, passed by august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan, then the benefit of no such specific declaration is to be 
given to the appellant, rather construing it otherwise, especially 
when learned Division Bench of this Court has already acquitted 
the appellant of the charges of corrupt practices including 
committing forgery.  
11. 
 
In view of above discussion, as there was no specific 
declaration under Article 62 (1) (f) of the Constitution against the 

 
 
Election Appeal No.24144/2023                                                 10 
 
 
appellant and further he was acquitted by the learned Division 
Bench of this Court on 11.03.2019, it cannot be said that appellant 
is disqualified for life to contest election or he has concealed his 
disqualification through Court in his nomination papers.  
12. 
 
In view of above discussion, this appeal is accepted and 
impugned order dated 22.03.2023 is set-aside. The Returning 
Officer is directed to include the name of the appellant in the list of 
eligible candidates.
