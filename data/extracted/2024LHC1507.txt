the order dated 28.02.2024, passed by the learned Single 
Judge in Chambers in the Writ Petition No.8594 of 
2016, whereby the Petition filed by the appellants under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 was dismissed and the order dated 30th

as 
Inspector 
for 
carrying 
out 
the 
investigation into the affairs of the company in the name 
and style of “M/s  ISAKHEL ESTATE FARMS LTD.” 
was held to be valid. 
2. 
   The brief facts, necessary for the disposal of the 
instant appeal are that Sardar Ghazanfar Ullah Khan, 
the predecessor of the appellants, along with others 

              Intra Court Appeal No.32 of 2024

formed a public limited company in the name and style 
of “M/s ISAKHEL ESTATE FARMS LTD.”, mouza 
Basti Isakhel Estate, Tehsil & District Rahim Yar Khan 
duly incorporated under the provisions of the 
Companies Act, 1913 and later functioning as a public 
limited company in terms of the Companies Ordinance, 
1984. Subsequently, Sardar Arshad Ullah Khan (Late), 
the predecessor of respondent No.2 (i) to (iv),  filed a 
petition under sections 152 and 290 of the  Companies 
Ordinance, 1984, before this Court. The said petition as 
filed by Sardar Arshad Ullah Khan (Late), the 
predecessor of respondent No.2 (i) to (iv),  bearing 
C.O.01 of 1995, was decided by this Court vide order 
dated 10.04.2015 and it was ordered that a copy of that 
petition along with all its annexures be transmitted to 
the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan  
with a direction to treat it as an application and decide 
the same strictly in accordance with the law. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan,  after 
receiving the order of this Court , issued show-cause 
notices to the Chief Executive and Directors of the “M/s 
ISAKHEL ESTATE FARMS LTD.”  under Section 265 
of the Companies Ordinance, 1984. After getting the 
replies to the show-cause notices and providing the 
opportunity of hearing, the Executive Director (C & 
CD), Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, 
Company 
Law 
Division, 
Corporatization 
and 
Compliance Department, passed the order dated 30th of 
August,2016 appointing Mr. Muhammad  Talib, FCA 
of M/s PKF F.R.A.N.T.S., Chartered Accountant, as 
Inspector for carrying out the investigation into the 
affairs of the company in the name and style of “M/s 
ISAKHEL ESTATE FARMS LTD.” as per the terms of

report within 30 days from the date of the 

              Intra Court Appeal No.32 of 2024

communication of the order. Feeling aggrieved of the 
order dated 30th of August,2016 passed by the 
Executive Director (C & CD) , Securities and Exchange 
Commission of Pakistan, Company Law Division, 
Corporatization 
and 
Compliance 
Department, 
appointing Mr. Muhammad   Talib, FCA of M/s PKF 
F.R.A.N.T.S., Chartered Accountant, as Inspector for 
carrying out the investigation into the affairs of the 
company in the name and style of “M/s ISAKHEL 
ESTATE FARMS LTD.”, the appellants filed Writ 
Petition No. 8594 of 2016 before this Court which was 
dismissed 
through 
the 
impugned 
order 
dated 
28.02.2024, passed by the learned Single Judge in 
Chambers, hence this appeal. 
3. 
The learned counsel for the appellants submitted 
that the learned Single Judge in Chambers had erred in 
facts and law while passing the order dated 28.02.2024. 
The  learned counsel for the appellants further argued 
that none of the conditions as enumerated under section 
265 of the Companies Ordinance ,1984 necessitating 
the appointment of an Inspector to investigate the 
affairs of a company were prevalent hence the 
Executive Director (C & CD), Securities and Exchange 
Commission of Pakistan, Company Law Division, 
Corporatization and Compliance Department, could not 
have passed the order dated 30th of August,2016 
appointing Mr. Muhammad  Talib, FCA of M/s PKF 
F.R.A.N.T.S., Chartered Accountant, as Inspector for 
carrying out the investigation into the affairs of the 
company in the name and style of “M/s ISAKHEL 
ESTATE FARMS LTD.” and the Single Judge in 
Chambers had erred in facts and law while passing the 
order dated 28.02.2024 ,dismissing the petition as filed 
by the appellants seeking the setting aside of the order 
dated 30th of August,2016 passed by the  Executive

Director (C & CD), Securities and Exchange 
Commission of Pakistan, Company Law Division, 
Corporatization and Compliance Department. 
4. 
   We have heard the learned counsel for the 
appellants and perused the record. 
5.     The perusal of the record reveals  that Sardar 
Ghazanfar Ullah Khan, the predecessor of the 
appellants along with others formed a public limited 
company in the name and style of “M/s ISAKHEL 
ESTATE FARMS LTD.”, duly incorporated under the 
provisions of the Companies Act, 1913 and later 
functioning as a public limited company in terms of the 
Companies Ordinance, 1984. Subsequently, Sardar 
Arshad Ullah Khan (Late), the predecessor of 
respondent No.2 (i) to (iv),  filed a petition under 
sections 152 and 290 of the  Companies Ordinance, 
1984, before this Court. The said petition as filed by 
Sardar Arshad Ullah Khan (Late), the predecessor of 
respondent No.2 (i) to (iv),  bearing C.O.01 of 1995 
was decided by this Court vide order dated 10.04.2015 
and it was ordered that a copy of that petition along 
with all its annexures be transmitted to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission of Pakistan  with a direction 
to treat it as an application and decide the same strictly 
in accordance with the law. The Securities and 
Exchange Commission of Pakistan, after receiving the 

              Intra Court Appeal No.32 of 2024 
 
 
5 
 
order of this Court, issued show-cause notices to the 
Chief Executive and Directors of the “M/s ISAKHEL 
ESTATE FARMS LTD.”  under Section 265 of the 
Companies Ordinance, 1984. After getting the replies to 
the show-cause notices and providing the opportunity 
of hearing, the Executive Director (C & CD), Securities 
and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Company Law 
Division, Corporatization and Compliance Department, 
passed the order dated 30th of August,2016 appointing 
Mr. Muhammad  Talib, FCA of M/s PKF F.R.A.N.T.S., 
Chartered Accountant, as Inspector for carrying out the 
investigation into the affairs of the company in the 
name and style of “M/s ISAKHEL ESTATE FARMS 
LTD.” as per the terms of reference and the Inspector 
was directed to submit his report within 30 days from 
the date of the communication of the order. Feeling 
aggrieved of the order dated 30th of August, 2016 
passed by the Executive Director (C & CD), Securities 
and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Company Law 
Division, Corporatization and Compliance Department, 
appointing Mr. Muhammad   Talib, FCA of M/s PKF 
F.R.A.N.T.S., Chartered Accountant, as Inspector for 
carrying out the investigation into the affairs of the 
company in the name and style of “M/s ISAKHEL 
ESTATE FARMS LTD.”, the appellants filed  the Writ 
Petition No. 8594 of 2016 before this Court which was 

              Intra Court Appeal No.32 of 2024 
 
 
6 
 
dismissed 
through 
the 
impugned 
order 
dated 
28.02.2024, passed by the learned Single Judge in 
Chambers.  
6.       A perusal of the order dated 30th of August,2016 
passed by the Executive Director (C & CD) , Securities 
and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Company Law 
Division , Corporatization and Compliance Department, 
appointing Mr. Muhammad   Talib, FCA of M/s PKF 
F.R.A.N.T.S., Chartered Accountant, as Inspector for 
carrying out the investigation into the affairs of the 
company in the name and style of “M/s ISAKHEL 
ESTATE FARMS LTD.” reveals that the said order was 
passed in the exercise of the powers under section 265 
of the Companies Ordinance ,1984 read with S.R.O. 
154(1)/2015 dated 19.02.2015 and while passing the 
said order, the Executive Director (C & CD), Securities 
and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Company Law 
Division, Corporatization and Compliance Department 
observed that the participation of the interested director 
in the Board Meeting wherein the  resolution for 
disposal of the agricultural land owned by the Company 
was passed, violated the provisions of section 216 of 
the Companies Ordinance,1984, which provide that no 
director of a company shall, as a director, take any part 
in the discussion of, or vote on, any contract or 
arrangement entered into, or to be entered into, by or on 

              Intra Court Appeal No.32 of 2024

behalf of the company, if he is in any way, whether 
directly or indirectly, concerned or interested in the 
contract or arrangement, nor shall his presence count 
for the purpose of forming a quorum at the time of any 
such discussion or vote and therefore an investigation 
into the affairs of the company became  necessary  and 
that, the Company had not been filing any returns with 
the Registrar concerned since 1995, therefore it needed 
to be ascertained as to whether the Company had been 
holding the election of directors properly and timely in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Ordinance 1984 and that the Company did not furnish 
any evidence in support of its claim regarding 
maintenance of proper books of accounts in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Ordinance 
1984. Section 265 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984 
allows the appointment of an Inspector to investigate 
the affairs of a company in certain prevailing conditions 
as enumerated in section 265 of the Companies 
Ordinance ,1984. It is also clear from the bare reading 
of section 265 of the Companies Ordinance ,1984 that it 
is not necessary that all the conditions as mentioned in 
section 265 (b) of the Companies Ordinance,984 should 
be existing at the same time before the appointment of 
an Inspector, rather even if one of the several conditions 
is, in the estimation of the Commission, existing, as the 

              Intra Court Appeal No.32 of 2024 
 
 
8 
 
word “or” has been used after every condition 
mentioned in section 265 (b) of the Companies 
Ordinance ,1984 allowing for the appointment of an 
Inspector,  then the order of appointment of an 
Inspector to investigate the affairs of the company can 
be validly passed. The rule is that  the word “or” is 
usually disjunctive and the word “and” is usually 
conjunctive and a withdrawal from the same is not 
available unless the very purpose and object of the 
Statute so requires. The reason being that if the 
Legislature wants to use “and” in a special statutory 
provision, then it has each right to do and nothing 
interrupts them from making so. So, if the word “and” 
has not been used and rather the word “or” has been 
used, it is clear that the Legislature has purposely 
applied the word “or”. Except when it is confirmed that 
there was some design or problem that stopped the 
Legislature from using the word “and”, literal 
translation has to be used to read the statutory provision 
and the rule “or” is usually disjunctive and “and” is 
usually conjunctive” has to be provided effect to. We 
have also noted that the order dated 30th  of 
August,2016 passed by the Executive Director (C & 
CD), Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, 
Company 
Law 
Division, 
Corporatization 
and 
Compliance Department had been passed by the 

              Intra Court Appeal No.32 of 2024

Executive Director (C & CD), after due consideration 
of all the circumstances and for sound reasons which 
had been recorded therein. The said observations of the 
Executive Director (C & CD) , Securities and Exchange 
Commission of Pakistan, Company Law Division, 
Corporatization and Compliance Department made in 
the order dated 30th of August, 2016 could not have 
been countered during the proceedings of the petition 
filed by the appellants under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,1973 
and the learned Single Judge in Chambers was right to 
observe that the accuracy and the veracity of the said 
observations of the Executive Director (C & CD), 
Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, 
Company 
Law 
Division, 
Corporatization 
and 
Compliance Department made in the order dated 30th of 
August, 2016 could not be challenged without receiving 
evidence and in a petition filed under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,1973, 
that could not be done.   In addition, we have gone 
through the record and have noted the recalcitrant 
attitude of the appellants who have frustrated the 
investigation of the affairs of the company for the past 
seven years. The appellants themselves should have no 
reluctance in joining the investigation if they can 
explain and answer the significant and well-founded 

              Intra Court Appeal No.32 of 2024 
 
 
10 
 
questions which have been raised in the order dated 
30th of August,2016 passed by the Executive Director 
(C & CD), Securities and Exchange Commission of 
Pakistan, Company Law Division, Corporatization and 
Compliance Department appointing Mr. Muhammad   
Talib, FCA of M/s PKF F.R.A.N.T.S., Chartered 
Accountant, as Inspector for carrying out the 
investigation into the affairs of the company in the 
name and style of “M/s ISAKHEL ESTATE FARMS 
LTD.”,  an order which even otherwise does not dispose 
of the entire case and the case remains pending until the 
report as sought is submitted by the inspector. 
7.    When learned counsel for the petitioner was asked 
to state the reservations of the appellants and he could 
only say that the appointment of the Inspector was 
likely to affect the reputation of the company and cause 
undue inconvenience to the appellants. We are afraid 
that the possibility of inconvenience to the appellants or 
the likelihood of affecting the reputation of the 
company can hardly be grounds for rendering 
redundant the provisions of section 265 of the 
Companies Ordinance,1984. Furthermore, the Inspector 
is directed to ensure that the appellants are not 
inconvenienced in any manner during his investigation.  
8.   The learned counsel for the appellants has been 
unable to point out any illegality or excess of 

              Intra Court Appeal No.32 of 2024 
 
 
11 
 
jurisdiction having been committed by the learned 
Single Judge in Chambers while passing the impugned 
order dated 28.02.2024. We find that the impugned 
order dated 28.02.2024 has been passed by the learned 
Single Judge in Chambers after going through the 
record of the case and taking into consideration the 
facts and circumstances of the case.  
9.      
In view of the above discussion, this appeal 
being devoid of merit, is dismissed in limine.
