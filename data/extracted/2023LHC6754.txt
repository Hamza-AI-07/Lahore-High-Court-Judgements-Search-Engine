Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Petitioner, Manzoor Hussain 
(PW-6), lived in Chak No.336/G.B., District Toba Tek Singh. On 
10.1.2018, he lodged FIR No.15/2018 Exh. PG/1 at Police Station Rajana, 
stating that the same day, around 11:00 a.m. he was going to his factory on 
a motorcycle with his brother, Haji Muhammad Hussain. When they were 
about 100 feet from the Rajana Toll Plaza, Muhammad Iqbal (armed with a 
pistol), Abdul Jabbar, Nisar, Shabbir, and Shakeel (armed with sotas), 
intercepted them. The accused forcibly took the Petitioner to a nearby 
orchard, physically assaulting him. Muhammad Hussain rushed to rescue 
him upon which Iqbal shot Muhammad Hussain with his pistol in the head 
near the right ear, causing him to fall. Iqbal then fired a second shot at 
Muhammad Hussain’s head. Jabbar struck Manzoor Hussain on the head 
above the left ear with a sota, and Nisar inflicted another sota blow on his 
right thigh. The remaining accused kept raising lalkaras during the episode. 
Meanwhile, Jameel Murtaza (PW-7) and Muhammad Boot arrived and 
witnessed the occurrence. Many other people gathered at the scene, and 
upon their arrival, the accused fled towards Chak No.517/G.B. Toba in a 
white car, issuing threats of dire consequences. Muhammad Hussain 
succumbed to his injuries on the spot.

Subsequently, the Petitioner recorded a statement with the 
Investigating Officer, Muhammad Aslam/Inspector, through which he 
identified an error in naming accused Muhammad Khalil, recorded initially

as Shakeel Ahmad, and sought its correction. The Investigating Officer 
rectified the mistake. 
3. 
 
The police investigated the case and submitted a report under 
section 173 Cr.P.C. on its completion. On 16.3.2018, the Additional 
Sessions Judge indicted all the accused persons who pleaded not guilty and 
claimed trial. 
4. 
 
On the conclusion of the trial, vide judgment dated 22.2.2019, 
the Additional Sessions Judge acquitted Shabbir Ahmad and Muhammad 
Khalil. However, he convicted and sentenced Muhammad Iqbal, Abdul 
Jabbar and Muhammad Nisar as follows: 
Muhammad Iqbal 
Convicted under section 302(b) PPC and sentenced to death with a 
direction to pay a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- to the legal heirs of the deceased 
as compensation in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C. and, in default 
thereof, to undergo simple imprisonment for a further period of six 
months. 
Abdul Jabbar 
Convicted under section 337-A(ii) PPC and sentenced to pay Arsh 
Rs.1,02,796/- to Manzoor Hussain. 
Muhammad Nisar 
Convicted under section 337-L(2) PPC and sentenced to pay Daman 
Rs.20,000/- to Manzoor Hussain. 
5. 
 
Muhammad Iqbal, Abdul Jabbar and Muhammad Nisar 
challenged their conviction and sentence through Criminal Appeal 
Nos.11311/2019 and 11527/2019, while the Additional Sessions Judge sent 
Murder Reference No.50/2019 to this Court under section 374 Cr.P.C. for 
confirmation of the death sentence awarded to Muhammad Iqbal. This 
Court, vide judgment dated 17.4.2019, set aside the trial court’s judgment 
to the extent of the above-mentioned three convicts and remanded the case 
with a direction to re-write the judgment after affording an opportunity to 
the parties to present their arguments. Crl. Appeal Nos. 11311/2019 and 
11527/2019 were disposed of accordingly, and Murder Reference 
No.50/2019 was answered in negative. 
6. 
 
In the post-remand proceedings, the Additional Sessions 
Judge, vide judgment dated 27.5.2019, convicted and sentenced 
Muhammad Iqbal, Abdul Jabbar and Muhammad Nasir to the same 
punishments as in the earlier round (see paragraph 3, above).

7. 
 
The Additional Sessions Judge has sent Murder Reference 
No.163/2019 to this Court under section 374 Cr.P.C., seeking confirmation 
of the death sentence imposed on Muhammad Iqbal through the judgment 
dated 22.2.2019 delivered in the post-remand proceedings. On the other 
hand, Muhammad Iqbal, Abdul Jabbar, and Muhammad Nasir have filed 
Criminal Appeal Nos. 38062/2019 and 38065/2019 against that judgment, 
challenging their conviction and sentence. 
8. 
 
On 28.5.2019, Abdul Jabbar and Muhammad Nasir 
(Respondents No. 2 and 3) filed an application before the trial court, 
seeking permission to deposit the Arsh and Daman amount under protest, 
subject to their right to appeal, which they subsequently exercised as 
mentioned above. According to the Petitioner, he did not receive notice of 
that application, though the Public Prosecutor represented the State. During 
the hearing of that application, the counsel for Respondents No.2 and 3 
stated that he had no objection to the above-referred Arsh and Daman 
amount being given to the Petitioner, who was held entitled thereto. By 
order dated 29.5.2019, the Additional Sessions Judge accepted the 
application. Thereupon, Respondents No.2 and 3 deposited the money in 
the government treasury in Madd-e-Amanat (R.D. Account) after which 
they were released from jail.

The Petitioner has assailed the above-mentioned order dated 
29.5.2019 in this Court through this revision petition.

11. 
 
According to section 53 of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 
(PPC), a court of competent jurisdiction, upon conviction for offences 
under the Code, may sentence an offender to one or more of the following 
punishments: (i) Qisas, (ii) Diyat, (iii) Arsh, (iv) Daman, (v) Ta’zir, (vi) 
death, (vii) imprisonment for life, (viii) imprisonment which may be either 
rigorous, i.e., with hard labour, or simple, (ix) forfeiture of property, and 
(x) fine. Clause (b) of section 299 PPC defines “Arsh” as the compensation 
specified in Chapter XVI of the Code to be paid to the victim or their heirs. 
Clause (d) of section 299 defines “Daman” as the compensation 
determined by the court to be paid by the offender to the victim for causing 
hurt, not liable to Arsh. Section 337-Y PPC describes how the court should 
determine the value of Daman, with sub-section (1a) stating that it may be 

Criminal Revision No. 40476/2019 
 
 
- 4 - 
payable in a lump sum or instalments over five years from the date of the 
final judgment. Sub-section (2) outlines the procedure where a convict fails 
to pay Daman or any part thereof within the period specified in sub-section 
(1a). Clause (e) of section 299 PPC states that “Diyat” refers to the 
compensation specified in section 323 [value of Diyat] payable to the legal 
heirs of the victim. Qisas and Ta’zir are defined in clauses (k) and (l) of 
section 299, respectively. 
12. 
 
Chapter XXVIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 
(Cr.P.C.) delineates the procedure for executing orders and the 
punishments imposed upon a conviction. Section 383 Cr.P.C. specifies that 
when an accused is sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment in 
cases not covered by sections 381 and 382-A Cr.P.C., the court that passed 
the sentence must expeditiously dispatch a warrant to the jail where the 
accused is presently held or designated to be confined. If the accused is not 
already in that jail, the court must transfer him to it with the warrant. This 
signifies that, following a conviction, an individual must be taken into 
custody to enforce the imprisonment sentence unless section 381 or 382-A 
is applicable.  
13. 
 
Section 382-A Cr.P.C. is relevant for our present purpose. It 
states that the sentence shall not be executed immediately when a person is 
convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for less than one year, provided 
they furnish bail to the court’s satisfaction for their appearance at the 
designated time and place. This deferral of the sentence continues until the 
period allowed for filing an appeal against the sentence elapses. If an 
appeal is filed within that duration, the implementation of the 
imprisonment sentence is postponed until the appellate court affirms the 
sentence. Nevertheless, the sentence will be carried out as soon as 
practicable after the expiry of the appeal filing period or, in the case of an 
appeal, after the receipt of the appellate court’s order confirming the 
sentence.  
14. 
 
In Muhammad Adnan alias Dana v. The State and others 
(2015 SCMR 1570), the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that the appeal 
against conviction is not maintainable unless the convict surrenders before 
the court. In Riaz Hussain v. The State and others (2022 PCr.LJ 1793), 

Criminal Revision No. 40476/2019 
 
 
- 5 - 
this Court held that when a convict submits bail bonds under section 382-A 
Cr.P.C., it amounts to surrendering before the court. 
15. 
 
Section 426 Cr.P.C. addresses situations where a convict is in 
custody pending an appeal and is not covered by section 382-A Cr.P.C. It 
empowers the court to grant bail by suspending the sentence.  
16. 
 
A review of the relevant legislative provisions and case law 
shows that, upon conviction, the sentence of imprisonment must be carried 
out unless it is deferred or suspended under section 382-A or section 426 
Cr.P.C. It is inpermissible for the trial court to allow the convict to deposit 
Diyat, Arsh, or Daman under protest for release. Any deviation from the 
prescribed course would constitute an act without lawful authority and 
would not be sustainable under the law. 
17. 
 
The Additional Sessions Judge, by order dated 29.5.2019, 
allowed Respondents No.2 and 3 to deposit the Arsh and Daman amount in 
the government treasury under protest. In view of what has been discussed 
above, we hold that the said order is illegal and without jurisdiction and set 
it aside.
