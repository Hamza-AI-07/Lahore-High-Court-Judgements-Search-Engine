Date of hearing:      
     02.02.2023. 
Applicant by: 
 
Mr. Abad-ur-Rehman, Advocate.  
Respondent-Department by: Mr. Izhar-ul-Haq Sheikh, Advocate. 
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J. Through 
instant Reference Application under section 196 of the Customs 
Act, 1969, following question of law asserted to have arisen out of 
impugned judgment dated 01.08.2016, passed by learned Customs 
Appellate Tribunal, Bench-II, Lahore (“Appellate Tribunal”) has 
been pressed and argued for our opinion:- 
Whether the Customs Appellate Tribunal was justified to hold 
that the imported Indian Raw Cotton was subject to sales tax @ 
16% instead of 2% as provided in SRO 1125(I)/2016 as 
amended by SRO 154(I)/2013? 
 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that applicant imported a 
consignment of Indian Raw Cotton, sought clearance vide G.D 
No.19338 dated 12.03.2013 and claimed benefit of SRO 
1125(I)/2011 dated 31.12.2011 to pay sales tax @ 2%, which was 
allowed. However, during course of audit, it was observed that 
applicant was liable to pay sales tax @ 16%, thus, caused loss of 
revenue 
at 
Rs.1,778,540/-. 
This 
audit 
observation 
was 

 
 
Customs Reference No.52 of 2016

communicated to applicant, which culminated in passing order-in-
original dated 08.04.2015, creating demand of said defaulted 
amount and penalty of Rs.15,000/-. Feeling aggrieved, applicant 
filed appeal against said order before Appellate Tribunal, which 
was rejected vide judgment dated 01.08.2016. Hence, instant 
Reference Application. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that learned 
Appellate Tribunal has failed to take into consideration that SRO 
1125(I)/2011, as amended by SRO 154(I)/2013, is also applicable 
on import by registered manufacturers of the five sectors mentioned 
in Condition (i). Adds that the imported raw cotton is an industrial 
input used for further manufacturing by applicant and sales tax @ 
2% is leviable as given in condition (iii) of SRO 154(I)/2011, thus, 
impugned judgment is liable to be struck down on this score alone. 
4. 
Conversely, 
learned 
counsel 
representing 
respondent-
department has opposed the contentions of learned counsel for 
applicant and submitted that from bare perusal of SRO 154(I)/2011 
it is evidently clear that it is applicable upon stages beyond spinning 
and there are two more stages in between ginning and spinning i.e. 
carding and combing. Adds that vide condition (ii) of said SRO, 
ginned cotton is specifically excluded from the purview of 
concession. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
By way of SRO 154(I)/2013 dated 28.02.2013 (effective 
from 01.03.2012), certain amendments were brought in SRO 
1125(I)/2011, and amendments in Conditions (i), (ii) & (ii) are 
relevant to answer the proposed question, thus, are reproduced 
hereunder for ready reference:- 
CONDITIONS 
(i) 
The benefit of this notification shall be available only to 
persons doing business in textiles (including jute), carpets, 
leather, sports and surgical goods sectors, who are 
registered as manufacturer, importer, exporter or wholesaler 
under the Sales Tax Act, 1990, and appear on the Active 

 
 
Customs Reference No.52 of 2016

Taxpayers List (ATL) on the website of Federal Board of 
Revenue; 
(ii) 
this notification shall apply from- 
(a)  
spinning stage onwards, in case of textile sector; 
(b)  
--- 
(c)  
--- 
(d)  
--- 
(e)  
--- 
(iii) 
on import by registered manufacturers of the five sectors 
mentioned in condition (i), sales tax shall be charged at the 
rate of two per cent on goods useable as industrial inputs,; 
 
It is explicit from condition (ii)(a) that SRO 154(I)/2013 duly 
included the spinning stage (in textile sector) and argument of 
learned counsel for respondent-department that said Notification is 
applicable on the stage coming subsequent to spinning stage is 
totally misconceived. Through afore-referred SRO, the concession 
has been given on goods useable as industrial inputs (at spinning 
stage in textile sector) by charging sales tax @ 2%.  
7. 
The next contention of learned counsel for respondent-
department is that two additional steps are available in between 
ginned cotton and spinning stage i.e. carding and combing, 
emphasizing that only after completion of these stages, the 
produce can be termed as raw material for the spinning stage. The 
aforementioned different stages in the production of cotton are 
briefly explained. Ginning of cotton is a process which separates 
the seeds, hull and any foreign matter by passing the cotton 
through a gin. Carding is a process in which the cotton fibers go 
through the process to make them ready for later processing. This 
includes separation and disentanglement of fibers, alignment of 
fibers, removal of short fibers etc. Combing is an optional extra 
stage in the process which improves the quality of the cotton by 
removing short fibers and arranges them into a flat bundle where 
all the fibers go in the same direction. After carding and, if 
carried out, the combing process are complete, the next stage is 
turning the fiber to yarn is spinning.

8. 
Undoubtedly, carding and combing do not change the 
texture or form of material and only line up the fibers nicely to 
make them easier to spin. In these processes, neither textural 
form nor chemical composition is changed inasmuch as these are 
not essential to be performed for forming the cotton as raw 
material for spinning. The moment when cotton is ginned and 
converted into bales, whether or not it is carded and combed, it 
becomes raw material for spinning. 
9. 
Needless to say that words in a taxing statute including 
notifications and orders, unless ambiguous, must be given their 
ordinary and natural meaning. The subject is not to be taxed unless 
the statute / notification clearly imposes the burden of tax, while 
language of the taxing statute / notification must not be strained to 
tax a transaction on the premise that had the Legislature thought of 
the same, it would have covered the events by appropriate words. It 
is now settled that while interpreting a taxing statute / 
notification, equitable consideration is entirely out of place. Nor 
can taxing statute / notification be interpreted on any 
presumptions or assumptions. The Court must look squarely at 
the words of the statute / notification and interpret them. The 
court cannot imply anything that is not expressed; it cannot 
import provisions in the statute / notification so as to supply an 
assumed deficiency. Moreover, interpretation of fiscal statute / 
notification had to be made strictly and any doubts arising 
therefrom must be resolved in favour of taxpayer and even if two 
reasonable interpretations were possible, one favouring taxpayer 
had to be adopted. Reference can be made to Messrs Khurshid 
Soap and Chemical Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. through Sheikh 
Muhammad Ilyas and others v. Federation of Pakistan through 
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources and others (PLD 
2020 Supreme Court 641), Messrs Continental Chemical Co. 
(Pvt.) Ltd. v. Pakistan and others (2001 PTD 570) and Fatima

Fertilizer Company Limited through Duly Authorized Officer v. 
Commissioner-II, Sindh Revenue Board (2021 PTD 484). 
10. 
In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that 
applicant is entitled to the benefit of SRO 1125(I)/2011, as 
amended by SRO 154(I)/2013. Therefore, our answer to the 
proposed question is in negative i.e. in favour of applicant and 
against respondent-department.  
 
The instant Reference Application is decided against the 
respondent-department. 
11. 
Office shall send a copy of this judgment under seal of the 
Court to the Appellate Tribunal as per Section 196(5) of the 
Customs Act, 1969.
