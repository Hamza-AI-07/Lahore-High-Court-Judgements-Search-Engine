……………………………………………………. 
 
MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J:- Allah Ditta and Basharat, 
(hereinafter to be referred as “accused/appellants”) after going through a 
trial in the private complaint arising out of FIR No. 165 dated 13.04.2014 
P/S Mureed Wala District Faisalabad vide judgment dated 30.11.2022 
handed down by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Faisalabad have been 
convicted under section 302(b)/34 PPC and sentenced to imprisonment 
for life each, with further order to pay Rs.500,000/- each as compensation 
under section 544-A Cr.P.C., in default to undergo simple imprisonment 
for one year each, benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended. 
Criminal Appeal No.82543/2022 has been filed by the accused/appellants 
to challenge their above conviction and sentence, whereas, through 
Criminal Revision No.7417/2023 the complainant seeks enhancement of 
sentence, both these matters are subject matter of this judgment. 
2. 
According to the narration of private complaint filed by Shah Jahan 
(complainant), it was on 07.05.2014 at 10:30 p.m. when his brother 
Iftikhar Ahmad Nadeem (deceased) went to Square No.68, Killa No.4 for 
irrigating the fields, whereas, complainant as well as Muhammad Fahad 

 
Crl.A.No.82543/22 and Crl.Rev.No.7417/2023 
2 
 
and Absar Ali were present nearby, suddenly, accused/appellants along 
with Zohaib Ehtisham alias Rashid (since PO), all armed with hatchets 
came out of the wheat crop and raised lalkara to teach Iftikhar Ahmad 
Nadeem a lesson for quarrel. Basharat Ali, accused/appellant inflicted 
hatchet blow on Iftikhar Ahmad Nadeem which hit on back of his right 
leg; Zohaib Ehtisham caused hatchet blow on right arm, whereas, hind 
side of hatchet blows by Allah Ditta landed on his back and left arm, 
thereafter, all the accused escaped from the place of occurrence along 
with their respective weapons. The witnesses claimed to have seen the 
occurrence and identified the accused in the light of torch and moonlit. 
Iftikhar Ahmad Nadeem was taken to RHC, Mureed Wala, but the doctor 
referred him to Civil Hospital, Faisalabad, who on 13.05.2014 at 06:10 
p.m. succumbed to the injuries. 
 
The motive behind the occurrence was said to be a few days’ earlier 
quarrel between the accused persons and the deceased. 
3. 
On filing of private complaint, cursory evidence was recorded and 
the accused persons were summoned. Initially, Zohaib Ehtisham alias 
Rashid attended the trial but Basharat Ali and Allah Ditta did not appear 
in response to process, therefore, they were declared proclaimed 
offenders. Trial was in progress and some evidence stood recorded when 
Zohaib Ehtisham alias Rashid absented him from the trial and is 
proclaimed offender till today. However, subsequently accused/appellants 
Basharat Ali and Allah Ditta were arrested and faced the trial. When 
charge sheeted, they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial, whereupon, the 
prosecution produced Shah Jahan complainant (PW-1), Muhammad 
Fahad (PW-2) as eye witnesses; Muhammad Ilyas (PW-3) identified the 
dead body at the time of autopsy, Khalid Hussain Sub-Inspector (CW-3), 
Ghulam Mustafa SI (CW-8) and Junaid Afzal SI (CW-9), respectively 
conducted investigation of the case, Muhammad Ijaz, Senior Clerk RHC 
Mureed Wala (CW-10) appeared as witness to give secondary evidence of 
Postmortem report on behalf of Dr. Muhammad Amjad (since dead) who 
had medically examined and later conducted postmortem examination of 
the deceased, whereas, rest of the witnesses are formal in nature. The 

 
Crl.A.No.82543/22 and Crl.Rev.No.7417/2023 
3 
 
prosecution case was closed by tendering in evidence the PFSA report 
(Ex.PF). The accused/appellants were examined under section 342 
Cr.P.C. who denied the prosecution evidence, however, neither they 
produced any evidence in defence nor appeared as their own witnesses in 
terms of section 340(2) Cr.P.C., and the trial ended in the terms as 
detailed above. 
4. 
Narratives and expressions in their respective case theories 
advanced by the proponents were heard at considerable length in the light 
of legal queries and provisions involved in the case while reading the 
evidence in the Court.  
5. 
The occurrence of this case dated 07.05.2014 was reported to the 
police on 13.05.2014 with a delay of six days which though prosecution 
tried to explain that complainant remained busy in treatment of his brother 
and on his death, matter was reported to the police, yet such explanation 
did not find support from any other material available in evidence. 
Medico-legal examination of injured was got conducted through police 
showing availability of firsthand information of the occurrence. This fact 
gets further support from the statement of Khalid Hussain, SI 
(retired)/Investigating Officer (CW-3) who during cross-examination 
deposed that injured himself appeared before him and stated that due to an 
altercation he had received some injuries. It is also in the evidence of PWs 
that from the place of occurrence hospital is just at a few paces; so much 
so there is another astonishing fact that Faizan, another son of the 
deceased is also a police constable, therefore, the sole explanation of 
prosecution about delay in lodging the crime report falls to the ground and 
possibility of due deliberation and consultation by Shah Jahan 
complainant (PW-1) before reporting the occurrence to the police cannot 
be ruled out of consideration. Reliance is placed on the case reported as 
“FARMAN AHMAD Versus MUHAMMAD INAYAT and others” (2007 
SCMR 1825), wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under; 
“The F.I.R. was lodged by the complainant after considerable delay of 17 hours 
without explaining the said delay in spite of the fact that complainant had stated 
in the written complaint that there was two eye-witnesses at the spot and none of 
them informed the police before filing a written complaint by the complainant. 
17 hours delay in F.I.R. provides sufficient time for deliberation and consultation 

 
Crl.A.No.82543/22 and Crl.Rev.No.7417/2023 
4 
 
when complainant has given no explanation for delay in lodging the F.I.R.”  
This first loophole in the prosecution case in the form of delay in FIR is 
further attended in the light of remaining evidence.  
6. 
It was claimed by the prosecution that occurrence took place on 
07.05.2014 at 10:30 p.m., the deceased and the witnesses were present in 
Square No.67 allegedly busy in irrigating the land through approved 
schedule of ‘Wara Bandi’ (turn of water); no source of light was shown 
available at the site except holding of a torch and moonlit as claimed by 
the prosecution; torch was not taken into possession by the Investigating 
Officer and it was also not proved that it was a night with moonlit when 
PW-1 conceded that it was 6th night of Islamic Month, therefore, non-
availability of sufficient  light at the place of occurrence provides doubts 
about the identity and precision on the part of PWs about roles of the 
accused persons. Thus, the very identity of the assailants remained fishy. 
Reliance is on the case reported as “HAROON SHAFIQUE Versus THE 
STATE and others” (2018 SCMR 2118). The Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in the case “SARDAR BIBI and another Versus MUNIR AHMAD and 
others” (2017 SCMR 344) has held as under;  
“….. The source of light i.e., bulbs etc. was not taken into possession during 
investigation to establish that the witnesses who were allegedly at the 
distance of more than 100 feet could identify the assailants. So, the 
identification of the assailants was also doubtful.” 
So much so it was admitted by the PWs during cross-examination that 
though clothes of the deceased were contaminated with soil but no mud 
was found which is not possible in the light of nature of work he was 
allegedly doing at the crime scene. Even otherwise, last worn clothes of 
the deceased when he received injuries were not produced during 
investigation nor before the trial Court. The fact of irrigating the land in 
Square No.67 was further under doubt when square number was later 
changed by the complainant through supplementary statements as 68. The 
final nail in coffin was the deposition of PW-1 who stated that Iftikhar 
deceased owned the land in Square No.47. No revenue documents were 
produced about ownership of Square Nos.67 or 68 nor any tenancy 
agreement was made available, so much so, schedule for turn of water 

 
Crl.A.No.82543/22 and Crl.Rev.No.7417/2023 
5 
 
issued by the Irrigation Department was also not produced, therefore, the 
place of occurrence remained doubtful and effort of prosecution to show 
collection of blood-stained earth from the place of occurrence after 6 days 
was nothing but mere an eye wash, which was not useful for prosecution 
in any manner. 
7.       Shah Jahan complainant (PW-1) and Muhammad Fahad (PW-2) 
appeared for ocular account. PW-1 was not resident of the place of 
occurrence and during cross-examination admitted as under; 
“It is true that we have our residential dharies and houses at Tehsil Chishtian, 
District Bahawal Nagar. I cannot rebut the suggestion of the defence that 
Tehsil Chishtian is at the distance of more than 500 KM from the place of 
occurrence.” 
Further deposed that “I have the photocopy of my identity card which is 
Ex.DA bearing No.31102-6448333-7 and on it my permanent as well as 
present residential address has been mentioned as of Chak No.207 
Murad, Tehsil Chishtian, District Bahawalnagar and said ID card was 
issued in the year 2012 prior to the present occurrence”. His residence 
near the place of occurrence was also doubtful when he remained unable 
to tell names of persons cultivating the land in Square No.67 and presence 
also becomes doubtful from his reply that he does not remember as to 
whether his clothes were smeared in blood while attending the deceased 
or not. These facts show that he was not present at the place of occurrence 
at the relevant time. Fahad PW-2 though was son of the deceased, 
expected to be residing in the same area but he also could not prove his 
presence at the place of occurrence when he deposed during cross 
examination that “I am unable to tell the name of any other owner of the 
surrounding lands of the place of occurrence”. It has also been observed 
that accused/assailants were not armed with any firearm weapons rather 
with hatchets, and witnesses admitted that PW-1 maintains height of six 
feet, other witness Absar was also of good height and in 18/19 years of his 
age, similarly, PW-2 Fahad was also of 22/23 years of age with good 
height and physique but against the natural human conduct they did not 
try to capture the accused or to intervene in order to save the life of 
deceased because they did not sustain any injury or scratch during the 

 
Crl.A.No.82543/22 and Crl.Rev.No.7417/2023 
6 
 
occurrence as admitted by the PWs during cross examination. Even 
injuries on the person of deceased remained on non-vital part of body i.e., 
knee, arm and back, and the injuries on his back were simple in nature, 
therefore, it was not a big fight between the parties so as to desist the 
complainant party not to intervene into the matter. From all such 
observation it is clear that both the PWs were not present at the relevant 
time at the place of occurrence, therefore, their testimony cannot be 
stretched in favour of the prosecution to be used against the present 
accused/appellants. Reliance is placed on judgment reported as “PATHAN 
Versus The STATE” (2015 SCMR 315). 
8. 
In order to get support for ocular account, medical evidence was 
essential but it has been observed that doctor who conducted the medico-
legal examination followed by postmortem examination was later died 
and Muhammad Ijaz, Senior Clerk of hospital appeared as CW-10 who 
straight away tendered the medicolegal and postmortem reports without 
narrating the contents of such reports, therefore, description of injuries, 
nature of injuries, kind of weapon and cause of death could not be brought 
on the record. Without appearance of doctor such MLR and PMR were of 
no use for the prosecution because doctor has not been tested through 
cross-examination with respect to his observation/findings made in such 
reports. Learned counsel for the complainant stated that support of 
medical evidence is available in the terms that during the stage when only 
Zohaib Ehtisham alias Rashid co-accused was facing the trial, Dr. Amjad 
appeared as witness and his statement was also recorded as CW-8. It has 
been noted that even such statement has not been tendered in evidence by 
the prosecution against the accused/appellants which cannot be used 
against them by mere referring it from the record because it was recorded 
in their absence, therefore, by all means prosecution hardly have support 
of medical evidence in this case.  
9.    The above anomaly about the admissibility of postmortem report 
without calling the doctor as a witness needs to be settled. It was attended 
in the light of arguments of learned counsel (s) as well as learned DPGs 
and thorough examination of relevant case laws efficiently collected by 

 
Crl.A.No.82543/22 and Crl.Rev.No.7417/2023 
7 
 
Mr. 
Muhammad 
Afzil, 
Civil 
Judge/Research 
Officer. 
Legally, 
Postmortem report is viewed as a documented expert opinion, therefore, 
its production in the evidence through primary evidence though is 
admissible yet contents of it cannot be read unless doctor appears as a 
witness to authenticate and verify that it was the report he had prepared. If 
doctor is not available then such report available in the Court record can 
be produced as secondary evidence through any person who had seen 
preparation of such document, knows handwriting or signature of the 
doctor on the report while showing a comparison with any proved 
document in the handwriting of such doctor, and this can also be done by 
production of another doctor or record keeper of the concerned hospital. 
This being so in the context of Article 78 of Qanun-a-Shahadat Order, 
1984 which requires that execution of a document must be proved through 
the mode and manner as suggested in law. A case reported as “SIRAJ DIN 
versus Mst. JAMILAN and another” (P L D 1997 Lahore 633) throws 
light on the subject as under; 
(i)    that execution of each and every instrument is to be proved unless it is 
admitted under Article 113, presumed under Article 102 of the Act or some 
other provisions of law. Ordinarily a document does not prove itself. It may 
be proved by following methods:  
 (a)        By calling and examining writer himself; 
 (b)        by evidence of person who saw the document being written 
 (c)        by evidence of person acquainted with the handwriting of 
the writer; or  
 (d)        by comparison of disputed writing/signatures/impressions with 
the admitted ones by an Expert's evidence. 
These methods are not exhaustive and any other recognised by law can be 
pressed into service. The proof of execution means the proof of 
writing/signatures/impressions of the author. The proof of execution, 
however, is not synonymous with the proof of the contents of documents. 
The burden to prove the contents of documents, in addition to proof of 
execution, is on the beneficiary of that document, who is to lead 
primary/secondary circumstantial internal evidence to prove the truth of that 
document. 
                                                                                      (emphasis supplied) 
Thus, despite proof of execution of a document by above means, truth of 
contents of document is to be proved. Neither the medicolegal or 
postmortem reports are the categories of documents as mentioned in 

 
Crl.A.No.82543/22 and Crl.Rev.No.7417/2023 
8 
 
Article 102 so as to dispense with a formal proof of its execution nor in 
this case it was claimed to have been admitted by the parties so as to rule 
out necessity of formal proof. In a case reported as “Ch. MUNEER 
HUSSAIN Versus Mst. WAZEERAN MAI alias Mst. WAZIR MAI”            
(PLD 2005 Supreme Court 658), the observation of Supreme Court 
was to the following effect; 
“9. Therefore, with reference to Article 78 of Qanoon-e-Shahadat, 1984, it 
was held that if a document is alleged to be signed or to have been written by 
any person, the signature or writing must be proved in that person's 
handwriting, the said Article places emphasis on the proof of identity of 
author of questioned documents and this Article does not say that mere proof 
of handwriting/signatures/thumb-impressions of executant will prove truth of 
the said document.”  
                                                                                       (emphasis supplied) 
10.    Thus, mere production of postmortem report is not sufficient to be 
read in the evidence as a support to the prosecution case. A like situation 
was attended in a case reported as “MUHAMMAD NAZIM and others 
Versus The STATE and others” (2022 P Cr. L J Note 82) [Lahore] when 
medical evidence was not furnished by the concerned doctor who had 
conducted the postmortem examination rather one Imran Shahid, record 
keeper appeared as CW-5, who stated that Dr. Afzal has died and 
produced the original record of postmortem report, it was observed that 
oral statement with respect to contents of document was not given by any 
expert witness, therefore, question of description of injury, its angle or 
trajectory and presence of burning around the wounds remained an 
unanswered story. Opinion of doctor could only be deposed by the said 
doctor as per Article 71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 which says that 
oral evidence must, in all cases whatever be direct, that is to say, if it 
refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it 
must be the evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those 
grounds. Thus, it was held as under;  
“Secondary evidence for doctor should have been given by another 
doctor/expert in order to assist the Court to understand the nature of injuries. 
Even postmortem was conducted on the next morning at 9.35 a.m. with a 
delay of around 8 hours without any plausible explanation. No time of 
receiving the dead body in the mortuary is mentioned in the postmortem 
report. Question of targeted or accidental fire could also not been explained 
which was the job of expert only, prosecution has not produced any expert 

 
Crl.A.No.82543/22 and Crl.Rev.No.7417/2023 
9 
 
for explanation. Therefore, medical evidence has no support for 
prosecution.” 
With almost in similar situation Jharkhand High Court in a case reported 
as “Dayanand Khatik vs The State of Jharkhand” decided on 6 February, 
2020 by a Division Bench, while discussing relevant provisions of law 
held as under; 
“18., ……………. A document in original if produced during the trial is a 
primary evidence, however, contents of a document unless the maker is 
examined cannot be read in evidence. In terms of section 293 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure a post-mortem report needs to be proved by the doctor 
who has conducted the examination or a person who is conversant with the 
facts of the case and can satisfactorily depose in the court on behalf of the 
doctor. In "Munna Kumar Vs. State of Bihar" reported in (2005) 12 SCC 209 
case, finding that the post-mortem report was not proved in terms of section 
293 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Supreme Court has observed that 
the appellant was entitled for the benefit of doubt. It has been held that the 
prosecution should have produced the best evidence by proving the post-
mortem report by examining the doctor or any other person acquainted with 
the hand-writing of the doctor who had prepared post-mortem report. 
19. The maker of the post-mortem report has not been examined during the 
trial and the person who has proved his writing and signature has admitted 
that he is not a medical expert and, therefore, the cause of death of Binay 
Kumar Khatik has not been proved by the prosecution.  
 
11.     Corresponding to section 293 of Indian Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1973, in ours section 510 exists but with slight difference, 
which is not applicable for medical reports. Mode of recording evidence 
of a doctor is mentioned in Section 509 of Cr.P.C. This Section falls in 
Chapter XLI which contains heading as “Special Rules of Evidence”, of 
course an overriding effect on all other provisions, consists of four 
Sections 509, 510, 511 and 512 of Cr.P.C. which with some connotation 
to cut short the process provides an expeditious mode of recording of 
evidence as well as securing the evidence for trial. Section 509 of Cr.P.C., 
is reproduced as under; 
 
509. Deposition of medical witness: (1) The deposition of a Civil Surgeon 
or other medical witness, taken and attested by a Magistrate in the presence 
of the accused, or taken on commission under Chapter XL, may be given in 
evidence in any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code, although 
the deponent is not called as a witness.  
 
(2) Power to summon medical witness: The Court may, if it thinks fit, 
summon and examine such deponent as to the subject-matter of his 
deposition. 
 

 
Crl.A.No.82543/22 and Crl.Rev.No.7417/2023 
10 
 
 According to Section 509 of Cr.P.C., deposition of a medical witness 
taken and attested by a Magistrate in the presence of accused or taken on 
Commission may be given in evidence in an inquiry, trial or other 
proceedings under this Code without calling the medical witness, 
however, Court does have a power to summon the medical witness as and 
when thinks fit. This section has like connotation as that of Section 164 of 
Cr.P.C., which also ensures securing of evidence of a witness but 
unfortunately Section 509 Cr.P.C., has lost sight of legal practitioners and 
by the learned Courts, therefore, on the eve of death of a medical witness 
or his migration to other country, medical evidence falls short of probative 
value which cannot be brought on record properly or if it is brought on 
record its probative value decreases due to non-availability of medical 
witness to depose about the nature, locale, size of injuries and other 
observation made at the time of examination and test/protocols performed 
to arrive at an opinion with respect to cause of death or other matters 
which are also relevant as per Article 65 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984. Thus, this Section is must to be adhered by all the concerned in 
future and Criminal Prosecution Service (CPS) should attend to the 
provision for securing statement of medical witness at the earliest 
opportunity while producing him before the concerned Magistrate so that 
on the eve of non-availability of doctor such statement could be used 
during the trial before the Court concerned. Necessity and utility of 
Section 509 Cr.P.C., has also been highlighted in Rule 6, Chapter-18, 
High Court Rules & Orders, Volume III. 
 
12.     Before producing secondary evidence of medical reports, it is 
essential to prove the non-availability of doctor. In a case reported as 
“SOOBA and 3 others Versus THE STATE” (1994 P Cr. L J 1323), this 
Court while referring cases reported as Allah Ditta v. The State (P L D 
1958 SC (Pak.) 290), Fazal Muhammad and another v. The state (1970 
SCMR 405), Hussain Bakhsh v. The State (1971 P Cr. L J 1331) 
(Lahore) and Muhammad Siddique and another v. The State (1974 P Cr. 
L J 180) (Lahore), held that absence of doctor must be proved before 
bringing on record the postmortem report as secondary evidence. Above 
judgment speaks as under; 

 
Crl.A.No.82543/22 and Crl.Rev.No.7417/2023 
11 
 
 
“The law laid down in the said precedents is to the effect that secondary 
evidence in such cases could only be allowed when the prosecution proves to 
the satisfaction of the Court that the doctor who conducted post-mortem 
examination was not available or had become incapable of giving evidence 
or his attendance could not be procured without an amount of delay or 
expense which in the circumstances of the case was unreasonable. It has been 
laid down that where any such evidence is allowed without complying with 
the provisions of section 32(2) of the Evidence Act (now Article 46 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984), such evidence shall be excluded from 
consideration.” 
 
In a case reported as “MUHAMMAD SHAM AND 3 OTHERS versus THE 
STATE” (P L D 1972 Lahore 661), while referring the cases Allah Ditta 
v. The State (P L D 1958 S C 290) & Nityananda Roy v. Rash Behari Ray 
(A I R 1953 Cal. 456), matter was remanded to the trial court to examine 
the foot constable for proof of absence of doctor and, then by calling 
original postmortem report, record the statement of dispenser who 
reportedly worked with the doctor well conversant with his writing and 
signature, and thereafter by comparing the carbon copy of postmortem 
report with the original allow its tendering through secondary evidence to 
prove the postmortem report.  
 
13.    In the light of above references, prosecution has failed to bring on 
the record the secondary evidence of medicolegal and postmortem reports 
in accordance with law and contents of such reports if deposed by the 
doctor in the absence of accused/appellant cannot be used against them. 
Even acclaimed contents of both reports allegedly deposed by late Dr. 
Amjad as CW-8 were not put to the accused/appellants in their statement 
under section 342 of Cr.P.C., therefore, medical evidence has no support 
to prosecution case. 
14. 
This Court is conscious of the fact that an occurrence can be 
motiveless, but here in this case in the FIR the prosecution gave a clue of 
some days’ earlier trivial quarrel between the deceased and the accused 
persons, which according to the prosecution formed basis behind this 
occurrence. Even in the private complaint, on motive part it was 
incorporated that  )اور جملہ ملزمان نے للکارا کہ آج افتخار ندیم کو جھگڑا کرنیکا مزہ چکھا دو). 
Except such simple words, no reference was given by either of the PWs 

 
Crl.A.No.82543/22 and Crl.Rev.No.7417/2023 
12 
 
that anyone from them had seen such earlier quarrel and what was the 
reason behind said quarrel. Thus, it can safely be held that though motive 
was set up yet the same could not be established by the prosecution and it 
is trite that though the prosecution is not required to prove motive in every 
case, yet the same, if set up, should be proved through independent source 
of evidence other than the words of mouth and in case of failure to do so, 
the prosecution should have faced the consequences and not the defence. 
Reliance is placed on judgment reported as “HAKIM ALI AND 4 
OTHERS Versus THE STATE AND ANOTHER” (1971 SCMR 432), 
which has further been adopted in case titled “RIASAB KHAN Versus 
NOOR MUHAMMAD and another” (2010 SCMR 97). 
15. 
Admittedly, no recovery of crime weapon could be effected from or 
on the lead of accused/appellants, thus, this element is yet another factor 
going against the prosecution and even otherwise, when the ocular 
account has failed, recovery even if had been effected, it being just of 
corroborative nature, could not have been considered and made basis for 
recording conviction.  
16. 
 It is on the record that accused/appellants remained absconders, 
however, when question was put to them about the abscondence, they 
categorically denied the same and both unanimously stated that fake 
reports were prepared by the police and in fact they were never informed 
by the police regarding the above said proceedings. There is also plethora 
of authorities of superior Courts on this point that mere abscondence of 
accused is not a conclusive proof of the guilt of the accused. The value of 
abscondence depends upon the fact of each case and abscondence alone 
cannot take the place of guilt unless and until the case is otherwise proved 
on the basis of cogent and reliable evidence. The accused persons 
generally disappear due to fear of police or because of the feelings of the 
guilt, and in this case during cross examination accused/appellants put the 
apprehension of their fake police encounter because son of the deceased 
was a police man; therefore, in view of the dictum handed down in 
“RAHIMULLAH JAN Versus KASHIF and another” (PLD 2008 SC 298) 
mere abscondence would not be taken as a conclusive proof of guilt of

accused. If any other authority in respect of abscondence is needed, 
reliance can also be placed upon “ZALEY MIR versus THE STATE” (NLR 
1999 AC 564), wherein abscondence of four years of the accused was not 
taken as a ground for conviction of the accused and accordingly the 
conviction was set-aside. 
17. 
For what has been discussed above, I am of the firm opinion that 
prosecution has not been able to establish the charge against the 
accused/appellants beyond any shadow of doubt. In the case “NAJAF ALI 
SHAH versus The STATE” (2021 SCMR 736), the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held that for giving benefit of doubt to an accused a single 
circumstance creating reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about guilt of 
accused is sufficient to make him entitled to such benefit. Here in this 
case as discussed above the prosecution has squarely failed to bring home 
the guilt against the accused persons. Consequently, the instant appeal is 
allowed, the impugned judgment of conviction and sentence is set-aside 
and the accused/appellants are acquitted of the charges levelled against 
them. They shall be released forthwith if not required in any other case or 
proceedings. Case property shall be retained for trial of absconding co-
accused Zohaib Ehtisham alias Rashid, whereas record of the learned trial 
court be sent back immediately. 
14. 
For the above reasons, Criminal Revision No.7417/2023 fails and is 
dismissed.
