Through this petition under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, petitioner Rai Muhammad Usama seeks 
quashing of case FIR No.337/24 dated 13.08.2024, 
in respect of offence under Section 16 of the 
Punjab Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 
1960 (Ordinance) read with Section 341 PPC, 
registered at Police Station, Muhammad Wala 
District Chiniot.  
2. 
Learned 
counsels 
for 
the 
petitioner 
submitted that the impugned FIR is result of 
malafide and ulterior motive; that the petitioner 
and other co-accused were celebrating 77th 
Independence day of Pakistan and have not taken 
the law into their hands; that neither the petitioner 
made any speech nor taken any action detrimental 
to the public peace and tranquility, as such 
provision of Section 16 of the Ordinance does not 
attract; that similarly there is nothing on the record 
to suggest that the petitioner or his companions 
wrongly restrained any individual, as such offence 
U/S 341 PPC is not made out; that no permission 
from the Deputy Commissioner before lodging of 

W.P. No.50329-Q/24  
 
 
                        2 
 
the impugned FIR was sought; that mens rea 
which is essential requirement to constitute an 
offence is patently missing; that there is no 
likelihood of conviction of the petitioner and 
continuation of the trial would be wastage of the 
precious time of the Court; that the impugned FIR 
is a result of political victimization and is liable to 
be quashed.  
3. 
Conversely, learned  Law Officer submits 
that offence U/S 16 of the Ordinance is cognizable 
and non-bailable, as such the complainant was 
vested with authority to get lodge the impugned 
FIR; that a number of accused persons including 
the petitioner blocked the road and chanted slogans 
which resulted in breach of peace; that due to the 
act of the petitioner and his companions traffic 
flow and public order was disturbed as such the 
complainant, being a police official, rightly lodged 
the impugned FIR; that the investigation is 
underway wherein the claim of the petitioner that 
he has not committed any crime will be 
determined; that quashing of FIR during process of 
investigation amounts to hamper and jeopardize 
the entire investigation process prior to its 
finalization which is not warranted under the law. 
In the end, a prayer has been made for dismissal of 
instant writ petition. 
4. 
I have heard the arguments advanced by the 
learned counsels for the petitioner, learned Law 
Officer and gone through the record.  
5. 
By way of this petition the petitioner has 
invoked extraordinary Constitutional jurisdiction 
of this Court for quashing of aforementioned 
impugned FIR. Ordinarily, time and again this 
Court has shown reluctance in interfering in the 

W.P. No.50329-Q/24  
 
 
                        3 
 
ongoing investigating process on the well 
cherished 
principle 
that 
the 
functions 
of 
Investigating 
Agency 
and 
judiciary 
are 
complementary and not overlapping and the 
combination of individual liberty with  due 
observance of law and order can only be achieved 
if both the organs are allowed to function 
independently. However, this principle in any way 
cannot be construed an absolute bar on the power 
of this Court in quashing of FIR in cases where the 
Court is satisfied that investigation is launched 
with malafide intention, without jurisdiction or 
there is no likelihood of the conviction of the 
accused persons. In case reported as “Anwar 
Ahmad Khan ..Vs.. The State (1996 SCMR 24)”, 
the Apex Court has laid down as under:- 
“ It is well settled principle that where 
investigation is malfide or without jurisdiction, the 
High Court in exercise of its Constitutional 
jurisdiction under Article 199 is competent to 
correct such proceedings and pass necessary order 
to ensure justice and fair play. The Investigating 
Authorities do not have the entire and total authority 
of running investigation according to their whims”.  
In case reported as Raja Rustam Ali Khan 
..Vs.. Muhammad Hanif (1997 SCMR 2008), it has 
been observed as under:- 
“ It would, therefore, be seen that if an 
investigation 
is 
launched 
malafide 
by 
the 
Investigating Agencies, the same is open to 
correction 
by 
invoking 
the 
constitutional 
jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 of 
the Constitution.” 
In case reported as “Muhammad Irshad 
Khan ..Vs..  Chairman, National Accountability 
Bureau and 2 others (2007 P Cr. LJ) 1957 the 

W.P. No.50329-Q/24  
 
 
                        4 
 
learned    Division Bench of Sindh High Court, 
observed as under:- 
“ Thus the consensus of the Honourable 
Supreme Court of Pakistan from the year 1971 and 
onward is that High Court  has jurisdiction under 
Article 199 of the Constitution and competent to 
correct such proceedings and pass necessary orders 
to ensure justice and fairplay. The Investigating 
Authorities do not have the entire and total authority 
of running investigation according to their whims, 
therefore, if the investigation is launched malafidely 
or beyond the jurisdiction of investigating agency, 
then the same can be corrected and appropriate 
orders can be passed.” 
The question what is “ malafide” has been 
answered by the Apex Court in case reported as 
“The Federation of Pakistan through Secretary 
Establishment Division, Government of Pakistan, 
Rawalpindi .V.. Saeed Ahmad Khan (PLD 1974 SC 
151) in the following way:- 
“ Mala fides” literally means “in bad faith”. 
Action taken in bad faith is usually taken 
maliciously in fact, that is to say, in which the 
person taking the action does so out of personal 
motives either to hurt the person against whom the 
action is taken or to benefit oneself. Action taken in 
colourable exercise of powers, that is to say, for 
collateral purposes not authorized by the law under 
which the action is taken or action taken in fraud of 
the law are also malafide. It is necessary, therefore, 
for a person alleging that an action has been taken 
mala fide to show that the person responsible for 
taking the action has been motivated by any one of 
the considerations mentioned above.” 
6. 
On the touchstone of above criteria, I have 
to determine the fate of instant case. In the 
impugned FIR the petitioner was charged under 
Section 16 of the Ordinance and Section 341 of 

W.P. No.50329-Q/24  
 
 
                        5 
 
PPC. Before proceeding further it is appropriate to 
reproduce said sections for ready reference.  
“Section-16. Dissemination of rumours, 
etc. Whoever— 
(a)   Makes any speech, or  
(b)   By words whether spoken or written or by 
signs or by visible or audible representations or 
otherwise publishes any statement, rumours or 
report,  
shall be punishment with imprisonment which may 
extend to three years, or with fine, or with both if 
such speech, statement, rumour, or report  
(i) 
Causes or likely to cause fear or 
alarm to the public or to any section 
of the public;  
(ii) 
Furthers or is likely to further any 
activity prejudicial to public safety 
or the maintenance of public order.”  
Similarly, definition of “wrongful restraint” 
contained in Section 339 PPC attracting the 
provision of Section 341 of PPC reads as under:- 
“Whoever voluntarily obstructs any person so as to 
prevent that person from proceeding in any 
direction in which that person has a right to 
proceed, is said wrongfully to restrain that person.” 
 Now in order to determine as to whether 
from the contents of impugned crime report, both 
the offences alleged against the petitioner are made 
out or not, it is appropriate to reproduce the 
impugned FIR, which reads as under:- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

W.P. No.50329-Q/24  
 
 
                        6 
 
First of all, we have to see whether Section 
16 of the Ordinance attracted from the contents of 
the impugned FIR, the answer is big NO. In order 
to attract the provision of said offence not only 
making of speech or words whether spoken or 
written or by signs or by visible or audible 
representations 
or 
otherwise 
publishes 
any 
statement, rumour or report is necessary but as a 
consequence thereof fear or alarm to the public or 
any section of the public or any activity prejudicial 
to the public safety or the maintenance of public is 
sina qua non.  It is manifestly clear from the 
contents of the crime report that on receiving an 
information, the complainant attracted at the spot 
and saw the petitioner and his companions were 
chanting slogans but what kind of slogans were 
being chanted by them was conspicuously missing 
in the crime report.  Since the nature of words, 
speech or rumour is necessary to determine the fate 
of its consequences that may occur due to said act 
is missing, therefore, it can safely be said that 
provision of said section is not attracted in the 
facts and circumstances of the case.  
7. 
   Now coming to attraction of Section 341 
PPC. Bare reading of definition of “wrongful 
restraint” contained in Section 339 PPC attracting 
the provision of Section 341 of PPC it is 
manifestly clear that obstruction should be of a 
human being and mere allegation that due to the 
act of the petitioner flow of the traffic was 
disturbed was not sufficient to constitute said 
offence. Reliance is placed on case reported as 
“Mst. Riaz Bibi ..Vs.. S.H.O. Police Station, 
Zahirpir (2002 P Cr.LJ 530)”, wherein it has been 
laid down as under:- 

W.P. No.50329-Q/24  
 
 
                        7 
 
“Where it is not disclosed that a human 
body was obstructed and that the obstruction was 
only to vehicle and passage was common to both, 
thus no offence would be committed under section 
341, P.P.C.” 
Since neither in the crime report, the 
complainant cited that any particular person was 
wrongfully restrained by the petitioner or his 
companion nor anyone step forward during the  
course of investigation to raise accusing finger 
towards the petitioner or his companion for 
wrongfully obstructing him/them, as such to my 
mind offence U/S 341 PPC is not made out.  
8. 
Needless to observe that mens rea is a basic 
component in order to establish that a crime has 
taken place.  It is derived from the maxim “ actus 
reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea”  which 
means “that an act is not guilty unless the mind is 
not guilty”. No person can be held accountable 
under the criminal law unless he can be proved to 
have acted with intention to commit a crime. Here 
in the instant case, the defence of the petitioner 
was that they were celebrating 77th Independence 
Day of our beloved country and the prosecution is 
unable to bring on record anything contrary to the 
claim of the petitioner. The prosecution is not 
equipped with any evidence that the petitioner and 
his companions were inclined to take the law into 
their hands and creating any law order situation. 
From the contents of the crime report, it is 
abundantly clear that the accused persons were 
going on motor-cycles in the shape of rally, as 
such in that backdrop question of blockage of road 
does not arise.  According to the complainant, 
accused persons were 16/17 in numbers, so if they 

W.P. No.50329-Q/24  
 
 
                        8 
 
have any intention to cause any loss to the vehicle 
or the police officials, they could do so but nothing 
such like has taken place. Even according to the 
impugned crime report on seeing the police party 
the accused persons scattered, which shows the 
respect of the law enforcement agencies in the 
mind of the petitioner and his companions. Had 
they any intention to create a law and order 
situation or disturb the public peace and 
tranquility, they could easily achieve desired 
result, thus, I have no hesitation in holding that in 
order to establish a crime against the petitioner 
basic ingredient of mens rea is patently missing in 
the instant case. In the words of Sir Matthew Hale 
one of the greatest scholars on the history of 
English Common Law and Jurist “Where there is 
no will to commit an offence there can be no just 
reason to incur the penalty.”   
9. 
Besides above, we are living in a democratic 
country and peaceful assembly is very important 
right for preservation of a democratic political 
system. This right has also been guaranteed under 
Article 16 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973, which reads as under:- 
“Every citizen shall have the right to assemble 
peacefully and without arms, subject to any 
reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the 
interest of sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan, 
public order or morality.”  
 From the very language of this Article four 
necessary preconditions are necessary for exercise 
of this right. Firstly, person should be a citizen of 
Pakistan. Secondly, gathering must be peaceful. 
Thirdly, the participants of such gathering should 
be weaponless. Fourthly, the right is subject to 

W.P. No.50329-Q/24  
 
 
                        9 
 
reasonable restriction imposed by ‘law’ in the 
interest of ‘public peace’. The term ‘law’ here 
clinches both primary and secondary legislation 
and implies that restrictions placed upon the right 
of an individual must have backing of law. Here in 
the instant case neither the nationality of the 
petitioner or his companion is disputed nor it was 
the case of the prosecution that the participants 
were armed or turned violent. Therefore, in the 
absence of any reasonable restriction imposed by 
law, the fundamental right of the petitioner for 
peaceful assembly cannot be curtailed. It was not 
the case of the prosecution that at the time of 
alleged occurrence, Section 144 of Cr.P.C. was in 
place, therefore, lodging of the impugned FIR is in 
sheer disregard to the fundamental rights of the 
petitioner.   
10. 
For what has been discussed above, instant 
writ petition is allowed as a consequence thereof 
impugned FIR is quashed.
