MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This regular first appeal under 
Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter 
referred to as “C.P.C.”) stems from the judgment and decree dated 
06th March, 2021, whereby the learned Civil Judge Class-I, 
Rawalpindi proceeded to dismiss the suit instituted by appellant 
No.1 namely Abdul Ghafoor (hereinafter referred to as “appellant”). 
2. 
Facts forming background of this appeal are that “appellant” 
executed general attorney in favour of respondent No.1 namely 
Babar Sultan Jadoon (hereinafter referred to as “respondent”) on 12th 
December, 2005 alongwith an agreement to sell of same date. In 
furtherance of the general attorney “respondent” executed registered 
sale deeds No.5041 & 5042 dated 15th July, 2006 in favour of 
respondents No.2 & 3, who are his real brothers. Being offended 
with the execution of sale deeds, the “appellant” instituted a suit 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-2- 
 
seeking cancellation of sale deeds and revocation of general power 
of attorney alongwith recovery of an amount of rupees four crore 
coupled with damages amounting to rupees two crore and possession 
of plot. Suit was resisted by respondents No.1 to 3, who submitted 
their written statement wherein they asserted that in pursuance to the 
general attorney executed in favour of “respondent” by the 
“appellant” coupled with agreement to sell dated 12th December, 
2005, he was left with no right to suit property and as such 
“respondent” rightly executed the registered sale deeds in favour of 
his brothers. On the other hand, appellant No.2 and respondent No.4 
being defendants were proceeded against ex-parte vide order dated 
02nd December, 2010. In the light of divergent pleadings of the 
contesting parties following multiple issues were framed :- 
ISSUES

15.07.2006 are result of fraud and misrepresentation and are 
liable to be cancelled, if so its effect? OPP

After framing of issues both the sides produced their respective 
evidence on completion whereof, suit was dismissed through 
impugned judgment and decree. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellants contended that in 
pursuance to the general power of attorney “respondent” got 
executed agreement to sell in his favour while practicing fraud and 
misrepresentation. He added that on the basis thereof, “respondent” 
though claimed protection of Section 202 of the Contract Act, 1882 
that the attorney has become irrevocable but it is not so. Learned 
counsel argued with vehemence that the “appellant” has been non-
suited on extraneous reasons. It is contended that execution of sale 
deeds in favour of his own brothers without seeking independent 
advice from the “appellant” being principal rendering the sale deeds 
invalid. Learned counsel submitted that though suit was well within 
time but it has been adjudged otherwise without adverting to the 
material pieces of evidence. It is emphatically contended that in the 
circumstances the limitation would be governed under Article 120 of 
the Limitation Act, 1908 and as such suit was well within time. In 
order to supplement his contentions, learned counsel placed reliance 
on Mst. IZZAT versus ALLAH DITTA (PLD 1981 Supreme Court 165), FIDA 
MUHAMMAD versus Pir MUHAMMAD KHAN (DECEASED) THROUGH 
LEGAL HEIRS AND OTHERS (PLD 1985 Supreme Court 341), 
MUHAMMAD AJAIB versus MUGHAL HUSSAIN and 2 others (2004 YLR 
690) and MEDIA MAX (PVT) LTD. through Chief Executive versus ARMY 
COMMUNICATION PVT. LTD. through Chief Executive and another (PLD 
2013 Sindh 555).

4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 
submitted that suit was covered under Article 91 of the Limitation 
Act, 1908 and it was clearly barred by time. Learned counsel argued 
that suit instituted by the “appellant” was in terms of Section 39 of 
the Specific Relief Act, 1877 and it is not to be governed under 
Article 120 of the Act ibid at all. Learned counsel contended that 
overwhelming evidence is available on the record with regard to the 
execution of agreement to sell in favour of “respondent” by 
“appellant”. It is maintained that after the creation of interest in the 
suit property, power of attorney which is even otherwise is admitted 
became irrevocable. Learned counsel contended that possession of 
the suit property lies with respondents No.1 to 3 and the “appellant” 
has concealed material facts, while instituting the suit. Learned 
counsel further contended that suit was rightly dismissed by the trial 
court and as such impugned judgment is unexceptionable. It is also 
one of the arguments of learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 
that documents were produced by the “appellant” in the statement of 
his counsel, which is not permissible at all. Placed reliance on Dr. 
MUHAMMAD JAVAID SHAFI versus Syed RASHID ARSHAD and others (PLD 
2015 Supreme Court 212), IMAM DIN and 4 others versus BASHIR AHMED 
and 10 others (PLD 2005 Supreme Court 418), S.K. SHAH through LRs versus 
JAMALUDDIN and others (2017 SCMR 626), MUHAMMAD ASLAM versus 
Mst. FEROZI and others (PLD 2001 Supreme Court 213) and MANZOOR 
HUSSAIN (deceased) through L.Rs. versus MISRI KHAN (PLD 2020 Supreme 
Court 749). 
5. 
Heard. Record perused. 
6. 
 The property in dispute is a commercial plot measuring 26 
Marla situated at near Tipu Road, revenue estate of Mareer Hassan, 
Qasbati, within the area of Tehsil Municipal Authority, Rawalpindi 
(hereinafter referred to as “suit property”), which was jointly owned 
by the appellants and respondent No.4. Being the owners of the “suit 
property”, the appellants as well as respondent No.4 executed a 
general power of attorney bearing No.2936 dated 12th December, 
2005 in favour of “respondent”, who in furtherance thereof executed 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-5- 
 
registered sale deed bearing No.5041 and 5042 dated 15th July, 2006 
in favour of respondents No.2 and 3, who are his brothers, which 
became the root cause of litigation interse parties. Being offended 
with the registered sale deeds, the “appellant” instituted the suit 
seeking cancellation of sale deeds as well as general power of 
attorney, recovery of amount of rupees four crore or the market value 
of the “suit property” alongwith possession. The validity of the sale 
deeds is questioned by “appellant” on two fold grounds; firstly, that 
the same were executed by the “respondent” in violation of the 
general power of attorney and agreement to sell dated 12th 
December, 2005 executed by him in favour of “appellant” and 
secondly the sale deeds are the product of fraud. Contrary to this, 
while submitting joint written statement it was pleaded by the 
respondents No.1 to 3 that general power of attorney executed in 
favour of “respondent” was with consideration as it was coupled 
with an agreement to sell of even date. From the pleadings of the 
parties there emerges some undisputed facts which are as follows :- 
• Suit property was originally owned by the appellants and 
respondent No.4. 
• All the owners executed general power of attorney in favour 
of “respondent”. 
• “Respondent” while acting upon general power of attorney 
executed sale deeds No.5041 and 5042 dated 15th July, 2006 in 
favour of his brothers i.e. respondents No.2 & 3. 
Parties are, however, at poles apart with regard to following aspects:- 
7.  
As per claim of the “appellant” after execution of general 
attorney the “respondent” executed an agreement to sell in his favour 
of even date whereunder he bound himself to pay the sale proceeds 
as per terms settled therein. on the contrary, “respondent” denied 
execution of any such agreement in favour of “appellant”. Similarly, 
agreement to sell pleaded by “respondent” being executed in 
furtherance of general power of attorney in his favour was seriously 
disputed by “appellant”. The factum of possession is also in dispute 
amongst the parties as per respective pleadings. In this backdrop, the 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-6- 
 
appellants assert that the general power of attorney was not coupled 
with any interest and as such the registered sale deeds executed in 
favour of respondents No. 2 and 3 are without any lawful authority 
unless the “respondent” being the attorney sought a permission from 
his principal i.e. “appellant”. On the contrary, claim of respondents 
No.1 to 3 is that general power of attorney was since coupled with 
agreement to sell and the principal has also received the sale 
consideration, so it was irrevocable and there was no need to seek 
permission from the “appellant” being principal. In addition suit was 
also resisted on the ground of limitation. From the respective 
pleadings of the parties and contentions of their counsel, following 
points for determination emerge :- 
i).  
Distinction between a suit for cancellation and suit for 
declaration. 
ii).  
Applicability of Articles 91 and 120 of the Limitation 
Act, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as “Act 1908”) 
iii).  Scope and import of Section 202 of the Contract Act, 
1872 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1872”). 
8.  
Before delving into the moot points, it would not be out of 
context to mention here that points No.(i) & (ii) are interconnected 
and dependent to each other. The applicability of Articles 91 and 120 
of the “Act 1908” is dependent upon the actual nature of the suit. 
9.  
From the perusal of plaint, it is apparent that it was captioned 
as suit for cancellation. Though learned counsel for the appellants 
while making reference to MUHAMMAD AJAIB versus MUGHAL 
HUSSAIN and 2 others (2004 YLR 690) submitted that nature of the suit 
is not dependent on its caption, rather it is to be gathered from its 
contents. In order to address this issue, it would be advantageous to 
have a comparative analysis of Sections 39 and 42 of the Specific 
Relief Act, 1877 (hereinafter referred to as “Act 1877”). Both the 
provisions are reproduced below for the purpose of comparative 
analysis:- 
“39. When cancellation may be ordered. Any person against 
whom a written instrument is void or voidable, who has 
reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-7- 
 
outstanding, may cause him serious injury, may sue to have it 
adjudged void or voidable; and the Court may, in its discretion, 
so adjudge it and order it to be delivered up and cancelled. 
      If the instrument has been registered under the Indian 
Registration Act,  the Court shall also send a copy of its decree to 
the officer in whose office the instrument has been so registered; 
and such officer shall note on the copy of the instrument 
contained in his books the fact of its cancellation.” 
“42. Discretion of Court as to declaration of status or 
right. Any person entitled to any character, or any right to any 
property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or 
interested to deny, his title to such character or right, and the 
Court may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is 
so entitled, and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any 
further relief: 
      Provided that no Court shall make any such declaration 
where the plaintiff, being able to seek further relief than a mere 
declaration of title, omits to do so. 
      (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law 
for the time being in force, a suit filed under sub-section (1) 
shall be decided by the Court within six months and the 
appellate court shall decide the appeal not later than ninety 
days, as the case may be.” 
Section 39 is part of Chapter V which deals with the cancellation of 
instruments whereas Chapter VI relates to declaratory decrees and 
Section 42 forms part of the same. In terms of former provision any 
person having reasonable apprehension that a written instrument 
being void or voidable to his extent, if left outstanding, may cause 
him serious injury can sue to have it adjudged void or voidable and 
the court may in its discretion, so adjudge it and order it to be 
delivered up and cancelled whereas in terms of latter any person 
entitled to any character, or any right to any property, may institute a 
suit against any person denying, or interested to deny, his title to 
such character or right, and the court may in its discretion make 
therein a declaration that he is so entitled and such person need not 
in such suit to ask for any other relief. 
10. 
The notable distinction between the above two provisions of 
the “Act 1877” is that Section 39 presupposes that the document 
whose cancellation is sought through the suit is void or voidable qua 
the plaintiff whereas in terms of Section 42 a person entitled to any 
character or to any right to any property being offended from the 
denial of such character or right or title from any other person, seeks 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-8- 
 
a declaration of his status or right without asking for cancellation in 
furtherance of such declaration.  
11. 
In the case of KHALID HUSSAIN and others versus NAZIR AHMAD 
and others (2021 SCMR 1986), the Supreme Court of Pakistan outlined 
the distinctive features of Sections 39 & 42 of the “Act 1877” in the 
following words:- 
“4. 
There is a marked yet subtle distinction between a 
suit for cancellation of a document under section 39 of the 
Act of 1877, and a suit for declaration of a document under 
section 42 of the Act of 1877. The crucial feature 
determining which remedy the aggrieved person is to adopt, 
is: whether the document is void or voidable. In case of a 
voidable document, for instance, where the document is 
admitted to have been executed by the executant, but is 
challenged for his consent having been obtained by coercion, 
fraud, misrepresentation or undue influence, then the person 
aggrieved only has the remedy of instituting a suit for 
cancellation of that document under section 39 of the Act of 
1877, and a suit for declaration regarding the said document 
under section 42 is not maintainable. On the other hand, in 
respect of a void document, for instance, when the execution 
of the document is denied as being forged or procured 
through deceit about the very nature of the document, then 
the person aggrieved has the option to institute a suit, either 
for cancellation of that instrument under section 39 of the 
Act of 1877, or for declaration of his right not to be affected 
by that document under section 42 of the Act of 1877; it is 
not necessary for him to file a suit for cancellation of the 
void document.” 
12. 
To the above effect, reference can also be made to Mst. 
HALIMAN BIBI versus MUHAMMAD BASHIR and 2 others (1989 CLC 1588). 
The relevant extract from the same is reproduced below:- 
“5. Both the contentions of the learned counsel are well 
founded. As regards the first contention, from the perusal of the 
plaint it is apparent that the petitioner had sought a declaration 
that the gift deed in question was illegal, unlawful, void and 
not binding on her. The plaint did not contain any prayer that 
she be declared as owner of the suit land and no declaration 
was asked for with regard to her title. On a bare reading of the 
plaint it appears that the suit was governed by section 39 of the 
Specific Relief Act and not by section 42 thereof. The 
distinction between a suit under section 39 of the Act and a suit 
under section 42 is quite obvious. In the former case the 
plaintiff does not seek a declaration regarding his title but only 
about invalidity of a deed while in the latter case relief asked 
for is regarding the title of the plaintiff or right in any property 
or status. In Bahadurmull Chawdhury and others v. Nagarmull 
Madangopal and others AIR 1941 Calcutta 534 it was observed 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-9- 
 
that though the Court's power to make declaratory decrees are 
limited by section 42 which apply only to cases in which the 
plaintiff, being entitled to any legal character or to any right to 
any property, brings a suit against a person denying his title to 
such character or right; but a suit to adjudge and declare that a 
contract is void and order it to be delivered up and cancelled is 
competent by reason of section 39. Similarly in Maneshier Gir 
v. Rehmatullah and others AIR 1936 Allahabad 710 it was held 
that where the plaintiff sought to have two deeds in question 
adjudged void, section 39 and not section 42 of the Specific 
Relief Act, 1877 applied. 
6. In order to determine whether a suit falls under section 39 or 
section 42 of the Act, it is the plaint as a whole which is to be 
considered. Even if, like the present case, the petitioner only 
prays for a declaration that the deed is void or invalid without 
asking for further relief of cancellation of the document, still 
the suit falls within section 39 of the Specific Relief Act, for, it 
is well settled that the prayer for cancellation need not be 
specifically made but is inherent and flows from the relief 
regarding the prayer for adjudging the document void. A 
Division Bench of Allahabad High Court in Akhlaq Ahmad 
and others v. Mst. Karam Elahi AIR 1935 Allahabad 207 was 
of the view that a suit under section 39, Specific Relief Act, for 
avoiding an instrument, even if there be no prayer for 
cancellation carries with it by implication a prayer that the 
Court may further use the discretion given to it by section 39 so 
as to order the said instrument to be delivered up and cancelled. 
Similarly in Bulakram and another v. Ganga Bishum 
Chaudhury AIR 1940 Patna 133 it was observed that it is open 
to the Court though there is no prayer for it to order the 
document to be delivered up and cancelled in a suit brought by 
the plaintiff for a declaration that the document is void. It thus 
becomes clear that even in the absence of prayer for 
cancellation, the suit of the petitioner was governed by section 
39 of the Specific Relief Act and not section 42 thereof. 
Under the law it is not necessary that in a suit governed by 
section 39 of the Specific Relief Act the plaintiff should in 
addition to a prayer for having the document adjudged void 
claim any further relief available to him. Section 39 of the Act 
does not contain provision similar to the proviso to section 42 
of the Act which bars the Court from granting a declaration if 
the plaintiff being entitled to further relief, omits to do so. This 
question was examined by a Division Bench of this Court in 
Nur Muhammad v. Mst. Karim Bibi PLD 1959 Lah. 932 
wherein it was observed that a suit under section 39 of the 
Specific Relief Act cannot be held to be non-maintainable on 
account of the omission of the plaintiff to sue for further relief 
even if such a relief is available to him. The learned District 
Judge did not advert to this aspect of the case.” 
13. 
On the above laid analogy when the suit at hand is examined, 
it is quite obvious therefrom that the appellants did not deny the 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-10- 
 
execution of general power of attorney and while admitting its 
execution are seeking cancellation. The registered sale deeds are 
clearly offshoot of general power of attorney. Moreover, the 
appellants are not seeking a declaration regarding their title but their 
concern is with regard to the validity of the deeds in question. In this 
background, suit was in the nature of cancellation and that’s why it 
was also captioned so, falling within the domain of Section 39 of the 
“Act 1877”.   
14. 
After having an answer with regard to the nature of the suit, it 
became very easy to hold that the suit would be governed under 
Article 91 of the “Act 1908”. Needless to observe that had it been a 
suit under Section 42 of the “Act 1877” it would certainly be 
governed by Article 120 of the “Act 1908”. Article 91 provides 
limitation of three years from the date when the facts entitling the 
plaintiff to have the instrument cancelled or set aside become known 
to him. It is asserted by “appellant” in the plaint that cause of action, 
firstly accrued to him on 12th December, 2005 on the execution of 
general power of attorney and it remained operative till the execution 
of sale deeds by the “respondent” in favour of respondents No. 2 and 
3 on 15th July, 2006, which stance is even evident from his 
statement, when he appeared as PW.1. The relevant extract is 
reproduced below:- 
 
Suit was admittedly instituted on 31st  May, 2010, which was thus 
clearly barred by time. Reliance in this respect can be placed on Mst. 
HAMIDA BEGUM versus Mst. MURAD BEGUM AND OTHERS (PLD 1975 
Supreme Court 624). The relevant extract from the same is reproduced 
below:- 
“Learned counsel for the appellant is right in contending that 
Article 91 does not apply to a suit where the cancellation of the 
instrument is merely incidental or ancillary to the substantial 
relief claimed by the plaintiff, for example, recovery of 
possession, or a declaration that the instrument is ineffective as 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-11- 
 
against the plaintiff's rights. This proposition finds support 
from a number of precedent cases, namely, Bachchan Singh v. 
Kamta Prasad (I L R 32 All. 392), Mt. Bageshra v. Shoo Nath 
(A I R 1916 All. 339), Chhaju Mal v. Multan Singh (A I R 
1936 Lah. 996), Unni v. Kunchi Amma (I L R 14 Mad. 26) and 
Rampal Singh v. Balbhaddar Singh (I L R 25 All. 1). In all 
these cases the principle enunciated is that if the plaintiff is not 
bound by the document, or if he is not claiming under the 
same, and the substantial relief prayed for by him is not the 
cancellation or setting aside of the instrument, then the suit is 
not governed by Article 91. Applying this principle to the case 
before us, we find that the plaintiff, claiming, as she does, 
through the executor of the impugned instruments cannot 
succeed in recovering her share in the inheritance unless she 
prays for the cancellation or setting aside of these documents. 
As a successor-in-interest of Sh. Mehar Din she is bound by 
these instruments as long as they remain operative, with the 
result that the property in dispute would not be available for 
her to inherit. 
It follows from what we have said in the preceding paragraphs 
that the appellant's suit was indeed governed by Article 91 of 
the Limitation Act. The question, however, is regarding the 
starting point of limitation. The learned Judge in the High 
Court has taken the view that the right to sue had accrued to the 
plaintiff during the lifetime of her father, Sh. Mehar Din; that 
time started to run against her from the date of the execution of 
the deeds; and that in any case she had come to know about 
these instruments on or about the 14th of November 1945, on 
which date her Mukhtar, Taj Din, had applied for copies of the 
mutations attested in this behalf on the 4th of August 1945. On 
these facts, the learned Judge has concluded that the suit filed 
on the 2nd of October 1950 was clearly barred by limitation, as 
the period allowed under the law was only three years.” 
15. 
In the case of MUHAMMAD SHARIF and 13 others versus INAYAT 
ULLAH and 24 others (1996 SCMR 145) the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
reiterated the above principles in the following words:- 
“12. Article 95 of the Limitation Act provides a limitation 
period of three years for a suit "To set aside a decree obtained 
by fraud, or for other relief on the ground of fraud" and the 
terminus a quo is the date "When the fraud becomes known to 
the party wronged". Now the suit of the plaintiffs in the present 
case is a suit for declaration and recovery of possession of the 
land in dispute and not for setting aside any decree or 
document based on fraud. It is manifest from the body of the 
plaint and the prayer made therein that the plaintiffs sought it 
to be declared that the power of attorney purporting to have 
been executed by them on the basis whereof, defendant No.l 
having obtained the allotment of the suit land further sold it to 
other defendants was a forged and fictitious document. Case of 
the plaintiffs is that they never executed any power of attorney 
in favour of defendant No.l and consequently they sought a 
further declaration that the sales made by defendant No.l in 
pursuance of the impugned power of attorney were not binding 
on them and were inoperative qua their rights. Prayer was also 
made for a decree for possession with a direction to be issued 
to the Registrar for canceling all the registered-deeds in favour 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-12- 
 
of the defendants. It is an established proposition of law that 
when the plaintiff is not a party to a decree or fraudulent 
transaction, Article 95 will have no application. Refer Mst. 
Sheedi v. Muhammad Siddique and 2 others (PLD 1980 
Lahore 477) wherein it was observed that for so long as a 
person is not actually a party to a document or to a decree, he 
will not be bound by it and for this reason, it would not be 
necessary for him to get it cancelled. His purpose will be 
served by merely getting it declared as void. Reliance in the 
aforenoted case was also placed on a judgment of this Court 
reported as Mst. Hamida Begum v. Mst. Murad Begum and 
others (PLD 1975 SC 624) wherein while interpreting Article 
91 of the Limitation Act which, too, provides a period of three 
years for a suit to cancel or set aside an instrument not 
otherwise provided for, it was held that this Article will not 
apply when the cancellation of the instrument is not an 
essential part of the plaintiffs relief. That is to say where the 
deed or instrument is ab initio null and void in which case it 
can be treated as a nullity without having to be cancelled or set 
aside. For instance, if a person who executes a document had 
no authority in law to do so or he is suffering under a legal 
disability, at the time of its execution, say by reason of 
minority, unsoundess of mind etc., the document will be null 
and void. It was further observed in the said judgment that 
"Article 91 does not apply to a suit where the cancellation of 
the instrument is merely incidental or ancillary to the 
substantial relief claimed by the plaintiff, for example, 
recovery of possession, or a declaration that the instrument is 
ineffective as against the plaintiff's rights". In an earlier case 
Shamshad Ali Shah v. Hassan Shah (PLD 1964 SC 143) also, 
this Court examined the question as to whether it is always 
necessary to seek the setting aside and/or cancellation of 
instruments obtained by fraud and it was observed that "A 
person who claims that a deed which purports to be executed 
by him is a forgery is not asking that the deed be set aside and 
is not bound to sue within three years". In the present case, as 
seen above, the plaintiffs have not sought the setting 
aside/cancellation of the impugned power of attorney. They 
only sought it to be declared as void and the sales made in 
pursuance thereof as not binding on them. In fact, on the 
allegations made in the plaint, which were not controverted by 
the defendants by filing any written statement as on their 
request, the plaint itself was rejected, it was not necessary for 
the plaintiff's to seek setting aside/cancellation of the power of 
attorney.” 
16.  
So far facts of the case Mst. Izzat supra heavily relied upon by 
learned counsel for the appellants is concerned, the same runs on 
entirely different premises. The said suit was mainly for declaration 
whereas cancellation was claimed as an ancillary relief and the 
plaintiff in that suit was in possession of the suit property, which is 
not in the case of the “appellant” whereas in the case of Muhammad 
Ajaib supra, the matter was related to inheritance and one of the 
legal heirs being aggrieved of the gift deeds and mutations, 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-13- 
 
sanctioned while excluding him from the estate left by his 
predecessor, instituted the suit challenging the gift on the ground that 
donor was suffering with “Marz-ul-Maut” at the time of alleged gift 
deeds. To the above effect, case of Dr. MUHAMMAD JAVAID SHAFI 
versus Syed RASHID ARSHAD and others (PLD 2015 Supreme Court 212) is 
very relevant wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under :- 
“In our candid view if an instrument is alleged to have been 
obtained 
by 
fraud, 
undue 
influence, 
coercion 
or 
misrepresentation, it is not a document which can be held to be 
void ab initio or on the face of it void, but it requires to be 
determined and adjudged by the court of law as voidable or 
void as the case may be and in such an eventuality, the matter 
shall squarely be covered by section 39 of the Specific Relief 
Act, which mandates:-- 
"39. When cancellation may be ordered.-- Any person 
against whom a written instrument is void or voidable, 
who has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, 
if left outstanding, may cause him serious injury, may 
sue to have it adjudged void or viodable; and the Court, 
may, in its discretion, so adjudge it and order it to be 
delivered up and cancelled. 
 
If the instrument has been registered under the 
Registration Act, the Court shall also send a copy of its 
decree to the officer in whose office the instrument has 
been so registered; and such officer shall note on the 
copy of the instrument contained in his books the fact of 
its cancellation.

(c)

And where the case is basically and primarily covered by 
section 39 ibid, Article 91 of the Limitation Act shall be 
attracted, which ordains and reads as under:-- 
Description of suit 
Period 
of

Time from which period 
begins to run 
91. To cancel or set 
aside an instrument 
not otherwise provided 
for. 
Three years When the facts entitling 
the plaintiff to have the 
instrument cancelled or set 
aside became known to 
him. 
In the instant case, the contents of the plaint, especially prayer 
part thereof which has been reproduced in one of the preceding 
paragraphs of this opinion clearly and undoubtedly envisages 
that the respondent is challenging the documents as being 
invalid against him on the ground of fraud, forgery, 
misrepresentation etc., and as a consequential relief per prayer 
clause (d) he unambiguously is seeking a decree for possession 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-14- 
 
of the plot in dispute by further asking for the demolition of the 
superstructure existing thereupon. This part of the relief upon 
proper construction of the plaint and the frame of the suit is 
merely ancillary, incidental, consequential and dependent upon 
the primary relief of cancellation of the documents which is the 
basic and the foundational relief being sought (emphasis 
supplied). If the main relief is time barred and the bar is not 
surmounted by the respondent, the incidental and consequential 
relief has to go away along with it and the suit is liable to be 
dismissed on account of being time barred. 
6. 
In context of the above, let us examine when did a 
cause of action arise in favour of the respondent entitling him 
to seek the relief of cancellation of document(s); and in this 
regard it may be pertinent to mention here, that in his 
examination-in-chief, the plaintiff in unequivocal terms has 
stated 
 "سال1974
"میں علم ہوا کہ پالٹ متنازعہ فروخت ہو چکا ہے 
In the cross-examination, he in similar words have stated 
 "سال1971
"میں میرے علم میں آگیا تھا کہ مختار نامہ بن گیا تھا۔ 
Though in the cross-examination, he mentioned that 
 "سال1978
 
"میں علم ہوا تھا کہ فضل عظیم نے پالٹ آگے منتقل کر دیا ہے 
In the examination-in-chief he states to have moved an 
application with martial authorities on the basis of which a case 
was registered against Chaudhry Muhammad Sharif, who is 
close relative of Fazal-e-Azeem and in the cross-examination 
he admitted that the application was moved in February/March, 
1971; he further admits 
"
Exemption
 سے متعلق مارشل ال کو درخواست دینے سے قبل علم ہوا تھا
 کہ استسنا ہو
کر پالٹ فروخت ہو چکا ہے"۔ 
He also admitted that he saw the said plot about 6/7 years 
before the date of his statement (which was recorded on 30-1-
1989) and at that time the bungalow had been constructed 
thereupon. Moreover unimpeachable evidence was adduced by 
the appellant in the form of the site plan for the construction of 
bungalow, which was approved by the competent authority on 
8-12-1973; the construction whereof was completed within two 
years; all the amenity connections such as electricity 
connection, water connection and gas connection were installed 
during that period and had been existing since then despite 
which the respondent never approached the court of law. All 
these factors put together leave no room for doubt, that the 
respondent had the knowledge of the GPA since 1971. He also 
had the knowledge about all the transaction(s) of sale in favour 
of Manzoor and the appellant made through the attorney Fazal-
e-Azeem on the basis of GPA since 1974, but did not bring any 
legal action under Section 39 ibid within the prescribed period 
of limitation per Article 91. Therefore, we are of the candid 
view that the suit filed by the respondent was barred by time.” 
17. 
Adverting to the last point for determination relating to scope 
and import of Section 202 of the “Act, 1872”, it is observed that 
power of attorney is a written instrument in the shape of 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-15- 
 
authorization by virtue of which the principal assigns to and confers 
upon a person, as his agent, the authority to perform specified acts on 
his behalf. In other words, the primary purpose of instrument of 
attorney is to assign or delegate the authority of principal to another 
person as his agent. The main object behind it is that the agent has to 
act in the name of principal and the principal also purports to rectify 
all the acts and deeds of his agent done by him under the authority 
conferred through the instrument. Power of attorney can either be 
general or special but in all circumstances, it must be strictly 
construed in the light of its recitals to ascertain the manner of 
exercise of the authority in relation to the terms and conditions 
specified in the instrument. A principal can revoke the deed of 
attorney at any time whereas Section 201 of the “Act, 1872” lays 
down the principles as to termination of agency in the following 
modes:- 
i). 
by the principal revoking his authority; or 
ii). 
by agent renouncing the business of the agency, or 
iii). 
by business of the agency being completed; or 
iv). 
by either the principal or agent-dying or becoming of 
unsound mind; or 
v). 
by either the principal or agent being adjudicated an 
insolvent under the provisions of any Act for the time 
being in force for the relief of insolvent debtors; 
vi). 
by expiry of the period of agency, if any; 
vii). 
by the destruction of a material part of the subject-
matter of the agency; 
viii). 
the happening of any event which renders the agency 
unlawful or upon the happening of which, it is agreed 
between the principal and the agent that the authority 
shall determine; or 
ix). 
by dissolution of the principal, where the principal is 
a firm or a company or other corporation. 
18. 
Before moving further, it would not be out of context to 
mention here that in ordinary course whenever an attorney intends to 
alienate or transfer the property subject matter of the deed of 
attorney in favour of his near relation or kith and kin, he has to seek 
specific permission from the principal to that effect before entering 
into such transaction. The above are the general rules regulating the 
power of attorney. Section 202 of the “Act, 1872” is, however, an 
exception and depart from the general rules. Section 202 of the “Act, 
1872” is reproduced below:- 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-16- 
 
“202. Termination of agency where agent has an interest in 
subject matter.—Where the agent has himself an interest in the 
property which forms the subject-matter of the agency, the 
agency cannot, in the absence of an express contract, be 
terminated to the prejudice of such interest.” 
From the bare perusal of the above referred provision of law, it 
becomes abundantly clear that when the agent has himself interest in 
the property, which forms the subject matter of the agency, the 
agency cannot in absence of an express contract, be terminated to the 
prejudice of such interest. Now the question arises as to “whether 
the deed of attorney executed in favour of “respondent” was 
coupled with interest and irrevocable? 
19.  
As already observed that execution of deed of attorney is not 
denied by the principals including the “appellant”. The “appellant” 
however claimed that the deed of attorney was not coupled with any 
interest and no agreement to sell whatsoever was executed in favour 
of “respondent” in furtherance thereof, rather it is the “respondent” 
who executed an agreement to sell in favour of “appellant” for 
securing his rights in the suit property. Though agreement to sell 
purportedly executed in favour of “appellant” was pleaded and 
brought on record as Exihibit-P6 but it was denied by respondents 
No.1 to 3. In that eventuality the “appellant” was obliged to prove 
the agreement to sell (Exhibit-P6) but to this effect only anecdotal 
evidence was brought on record and even marginal witnesses except 
Omer Hayat (PW.2) were not examined to ensure compliance of 
Articles 17 & 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. On the 
contrary, agreement to sell pleaded by respondents No.1 to 3 statedly 
executed in furtherance of the deed of attorney (Exhibit-D1) was 
though denied by “appellant” in the plaint but while appearing in the 
witness box as PW1 he took a somersault in the following words:- 
 
 
 
It is trite law that admitted facts need not be proved. When once it is 
established on the record that deed of attorney was coupled with 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-17- 
 
agreement to sell whereunder the “appellant” also received whole 
consideration, there remains no cavil that deed of attorney was 
irrevocable. There was thus no need for the attorney (“respondent”) 
to obtain the consent of the principals (appellants) before executing 
the sale deeds in favour of respondents No.2 and 3.  
20. 
To the above effect learned counsel for the appellants has 
though made reference to the case of Media Max (Pvt) Ltd. supra 
and contended that Section 202 of the “Act, 1872” would only come 
into play when an interest in the property is created prior to the 
execution of attorney, which is not so in the present case, but such 
contention seems to be the outcome of improper analysis of the facts 
involved therein. Guidance to this effect can be sought from 
MUHAMMAD YOUSAF versus Mst. AZRA PARVEEN (2012 SCMR 380) 
wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under :- 
“8. The finding of the learned Judge of the High Court appears 
to be correct. The amount so received cannot be given a colour 
of loan when preponderance of the evidence on the record does 
not tend to support it. Even the power of attorney and for that 
matter the agreement to sell, whose execution has been 
established through aboveboard evidence, leave no foothold for 
the appellant to stand upon and deny their execution with his 
chin up. The judgment rendered in cases of Fida Muhammad v. 
Pir Muhammad Khan, Jamil Akhtar v. Las Baba and others and 
Muhammad Ashraf and 2 others v. Muhammad Malik and 2 
others (supra) cannot, in any way, advance the case of the 
appellant when the power of attorney was executed on receipt 
of sale consideration. It is clearly a case where the subject-
matter of agency is coupled with an interest. The purpose 
behind creating this agency, inasmuch as it can be gleaned 
from the evidence on the record, was to secure and protect an 
interest accruing to respondent No.2 upon payment of the 
amount mentioned above. We, therefore, don't agree with the 
learned counsel for the appellant that no transfer could validly 
be made by the donee of the power of attorney without 
obtaining the consent of its donor.  It  is,  quite  obviously,  a  
case  of  authority  coupled  with  an  interest  falling  within  
the  purview  of  section  202  of  the  Contract Act, 1872. 
Though the section itself is clear yet para 868 of Halsbury's 
Laws of England  would be quite illustrative in this behalf, 
which reads as under:-- 
"868. Authority coupled with interest.---Where the agency 
is created by deed, or for valuable consideration, and the 
authority is given to effectuate a security or to security or to 
secure the interest of the agent, the authority cannot be 
revoked. Thus, if an agreement is entered into on a 
sufficient consideration whereby an authority is given for 
the purpose of securing some benefit to the donee of the 
authority, the authority is irrevocable on the ground that it 
is coupled with an interest. So, an authority to sell in 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-18- 
 
consideration for forbearance to sue for previous advances, 
an authority to apply for share to be allotted on an 
underwriting agreement a commission being paid for the 
underwriting,  and  an  authority  to  receive  rents  until  
the  principal  and  interest  of  a  loan  have  been   paid  of  
or  to receive  money  for  a  third  party  in  payment  of  a 
debt, have been held to be irrevocable. On the other hand, 
an authority is not irrevocable merely because the agent has 
a special property in or a lien upon goods to which the 
authority relates, the authority not being given for the 
purpose of securing the claims of the agent." 
21. 
There is yet another important aspect, agreement to sell 
(Exhibit-P1) was tendered in evidence through the statement of 
counsel which was never confronted to the “respondent”. In the case 
of Mst. AKHTAR SULTANA versus Major Retd. MUZAFFAR KHAN MALIK 
through his legal heirs and others (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 715) the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan outlined the true import of the relevant 
provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 dealing with the 
relevancy and admissibility of the documentary evidence. The 
relevant extract from the same is reproduced below : - 
“(i) Relevant and admissible evidence  
10. The Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 ("Qanun-e-Shahadat") 
governs the law of evidence in our country. The expression 
"relevancy" and "admissibility" have their own distinct legal 
implications under the Qanun-e-Shahadat as, more often than 
not, facts which are relevant may not be admissible. On the one 
hand, a fact is "relevant" if it is logically probative or 
disprobative of the fact-in-issue, which requires proof. On the 
other hand, a fact is "admissible" if it is relevant and not 
excluded by any exclusionary provision, express or implied. 
What is to be understood is that unlike "relevance", which is 
factual and determined solely by reference to the logical 
relationship between the fact claimed to be relevant and the 
fact-in-issue, "admissibility" is a matter of law. Thus, a 
"relevant" fact would be "admissible" unless it is excluded 
from being admitted, or is required to be proved in a particular 
mode(s) before it can be admitted as evidence, by the 
provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat. As far as the latter is 
concerned, and that too relating to documents, admissibility is 
of two types: (i) admissible subject to proof, and (ii) admissible 
per se, that is, when the document is admitted in evidence 
without requiring proof. 
(ii) Mode of proof  
11. Mode of proof is the procedure by which the "relevant" and 
"admissible" facts have to be proved, the manner whereof has 
been prescribed in Articles 70-89 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat. In 
other words, a "relevant" and "admissible" fact is admitted as a 
piece of evidence, only when the same has been proved by the 
party asserting the same. In this regard, the foundational 
principle governing proof of contents of documents is that the 
same are to be proved by producing "primary evidence" or 
"secondary evidence". The latter is only permissible in certain 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-19- 
 
prescribed circumstances, which have been expressly provided 
in the Qanun-e-Shahadat.  
12. What is important to note is that, as a general principle, an 
objection as to inadmissibility of a document can be raised at 
any stage of the case, even if it had not been taken when the 
document was tendered in evidence. However, the objection as 
to the mode of proving contents of a document or its execution 
is to be taken, when a particular mode is adopted by the party 
at the evidence-recording stage during trial. The latter kind of  
objection cannot be allowed to be raised, for the first time, at 
any subsequent stage. This principle is based on the rule of fair 
play. As if the objection regarding the mode of proof adopted 
has been taken at the appropriate stage, it would have enabled 
the party tendering the evidence to cure the defect and resort to 
other mode of proof. The omission to object at the appropriate 
stage becomes fatal because, by his failure, the party entitled to 
object allows the party tendering the evidence to act on 
assumption that he has no objection about the mode of proof 
adopted. 
13. It is also important to note that the objection as to "mode of 
proof" should not be confused with the objection of "absence 
of proof". Absence of proof goes to the very root of 
admissibility of the document as a piece of evidence; therefore, 
this objection can be raised at any stage, as the first proviso to 
Article 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat commands that "the 
judgment must be based upon facts declared by this Order to be 
relevant, and duly proved". In other words, when the Qanun-e-
Shahadat provides several modes of proving a relevant fact and 
a party adopts a particular mode that is permissible only in 
certain circumstances, the failure to take objection when that 
mode is adopted, estops the opposing party to raise, at a 
subsequent stage, the objection to the mode of proof adopted. 
However, when the Qanun-e-Shahadat provides only one mode 
of proving a relevant fact and that mode is not adopted, or 
when it provides several modes of proving a relevant fact and 
none of them is adopted, such a case falls within the purview of 
"absence of proof", and not "mode of proof"; therefore, the 
objection thereto can be taken at any stage, even if it has not 
earlier been taken. 
(iii) Evidentiary value  
14. Once a fact crosses the threshold of "relevancy", 
"admissibility" and "proof", as mandated under the provisions 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, would it be said to be admitted, for 
its evidentiary value to be adjudged by the trial court. The 
evidentiary value or in other words, weight of evidence, is 
actually a qualitative assessment made by the trial judge of the 
probative value of the proved fact. Unlike "admissibility", the 
evidentiary value of a piece of evidence cannot be determined 
by fixed rules, since it depends mainly on common sense, logic 
and experience and is determined by the trial judge, keeping in 
view the peculiarities of each case.” 
To be above effect guidance can be sought from MANZOOR HUSSAIN 
(deceased) through L.Rs. versus MISRI KHAN (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 
749) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under :- 
“4. 
Before parting with this case we would like to 
comment 
on 
a 
related 
matter. 
Copies 
of 
the 
acknowledgement receipt (exhibit P4), aks shajarah kishtwar 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-20- 
 
(exhibit P2), registered post receipt (exhibit P3), mutation 
(exhibit P5) and jamabandi for the year 2000-2001 (exhibit 
P6) were produced and exhibited by the pre-emptor's 
counsel, but without him testifying. We have noted that 
copies of documents, having no concern with counsel, are 
often tendered in evidence through a simple statement of 
counsel but without administering an oath to him and 
without him testifying, especially in the province of Punjab. 
Ordinarily, documents are produced through a witness who 
testifies on oath and who may be cross-examined by the 
other side. However, there are exceptions with regard to 
facts which need not be proved; these are those which the 
Court will take judicial notice of under Article 111 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and are mentioned in Article 
112, and facts which are admitted (Article 113, Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984). 
5. 
The acknowledgement receipt was stated to have 
been signed when the envelope said to contain the Talb-i-
Ishhad notice was purportedly received by the respondent. 
However, the respondent had not admitted receipt of the said 
notice, therefore, the acknowledgement receipt (exhibit P4) 
could not be stated to be an admitted document and did not 
constitute an admitted fact. Therefore, delivery to and/or 
receipt by the respondent of the notice had to be established. 
We also note that in this case the said counsel had furnished 
copies of all five documents (exhibits P2 to P6), which were 
produced by him. The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
explicitly sets out the documents which must be produced in 
original, which in the present case would be the registered 
post receipt (exhibit P3) and acknowledgment receipt 
(exhibit P4), and photo copies, that is secondary evidence, 
could only be produced as permitted; and as regards extracts 
of official records, that is, the aks shajarah kishtwar (exhibit 
P2), mutation (exhibit P5) and jamabandi (exhibit P6), 
certified copies thereof had to be tendered in evidence. In 
not 
observing 
the 
rules 
of 
evidence 
unnecessary 
complications for litigants are created, which may result in 
avoidable adverse orders or in the case being remanded on 
such score, which would be avoided by abiding by the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.” 
The above principles were even reiterated by this Court in the case of 
NATIONAL COMMAND AUTHORITY through D.G. SPD, Rawalpindi and 
others versus ZAHOOR AZAM and others (2024 CLC 1).  
22. 
After having an overview of the principles noted hereinabove 
it can be held without any hint of doubt that agreement to sell 
(Exhibit-P1) which was produced in the statement of learned counsel 
for the “appellant” is not permissible at all. 
23.  
So far possession of “suit property” is concerned it is observed 
that the “appellant” in his plaint claimed that the possession of the 
suit property lies with him but it was only an half hearted assertion, 
which is even evident from the prayer clause. This was the reason 

R.F.A. No.71 of 2021 
-21- 
 
that when he appeared in the witness box made the following 
statement:- 
 
In view of above admission, it can safely be inferred that the 
appellants are clearly out of possession. 
24.  
It would be also noteworthy that suit was only instituted by the 
“appellant” and appellant No.2 was amongst the defendants, though 
he appeared as DW.2. The other executants of the deed of attorney 
neither challenged the same till to date nor came forward to question 
its validity.  
25.  
As a nutshell of thread bare discussion mentioned 
hereinabove, we are of the unanimous view that suit was rightly 
dismissed by the trial court, as a result this appeal is devoid of any 
merits, resultantly it is dismissed with no order as to costs.
