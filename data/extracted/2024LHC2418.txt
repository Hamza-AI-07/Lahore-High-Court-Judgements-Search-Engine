Mr. Ehsan Ullah Manj, Advocate for petitioners. 
Rai Mazhar Hussain Kharal, Assistant Advocate General. 
Mr. Zafar Iqbal Sheikh, Advocate for respondent No.3.  
 
This constitutional petition is directed against order 
dated 27.03.2024, whereby respondent No.2 - Presiding 
Officer District Consumer Court Bahawalnagar - had 
dismissed the application preferred by the petitioners 
seeking rejection / return of complaint, brought by 
respondent No.3. Petitioners plead that respondent No.2, 
exercising powers under the provisions of Punjab 
Consumer Protection Act, 2005 (‘Act 2005’), lacks 
jurisdiction to hear, entertain and adjudicate the complaint 
and in fact jurisdiction to inquire into allegations of 
maladministration, malpractices and alleged failure on the 
part of the Healthcare Service Provider – [claimed that 
Chughtai Lab Jail Road Lahore is the Healthcare Service 
Provider] exclusively vests in the Healthcare Commission 
under the provisions of Punjab Healthcare Commission 
Act, 2010 (‘Act of 2010’). 
2. 
Facts essential for deciding instant constitutional 
petition are that respondent No.3 hired services for 
carrying out certain clinical tests. Respondent No.3 
questioned the veracity of clinical reports by the 
petitioners and put service provider to notice, whereafter 

W.P. No.2863/2024 
 
-:2:- 
 
 
complaint was filed for recovery of damages, claiming 
liability for faulty or defective services, by invoking 
jurisdiction of Consumer Court. Jurisdiction of respondent 
No.2 to proceed with complaint was questioned and 
objection repelled. Hence, this petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners pleaded that in 
terms of sub-section (2) of section 26 and section 29, read 
with section 4 (e) of the Act of 2010, jurisdiction to 
investigate 
with 
respect 
to 
allegations 
of 
maladministration, malpractice and failure in provisioning 
of 
healthcare 
services 
vests, 
exclusively, 
in 
the 
Commission, which jurisdiction can be triggered upon 
bringing grievance to the notice of Commission in terms of 
section 4(7)(a) of the Act 2010. It is emphasized that issue 
came up for adjudication earlier and decided vide decision 
in the case of Dr. Riaz Qadeer Khan vs. Presiding Officer, 
District Consumer Court, Sargodha and others (PLD 2019 
Lahore 429). Adds that ratio was followed in the case of 
Lady Dr. Nafesa Saleem and another vs. Justice of 
Peace/Additional Sessions Judge, Multan and 2 others 
(PLD 2022 Lahore 18) and also in an unreported decision 
in the case of “Mariam Sajjad vs. Prof. Dr. Rasool Ahmed 
Chaudhry (RFA No.70634/2023). 
4. 
Conversely, 
learned 
counsel 
appearing 
for 
respondent No.3 submits that jurisdiction of 
the 
Commission, which is otherwise discretionary, is restricted 
to imposition of penalty and Commission had no power to 
adjudicate claim of damages and grant damages, 
contractual or tortuous, which jurisdiction is either vested 
in the Consumer Court or Civil Court, depending on the 
facts of the case. He relies upon unreported decision in the 
case of “Mariam Sajjad vs. Prof. Dr. Rasool Ahmed

Chaudhry (RFA No.70634/2023), Dr. Muhammad Asif 
Osawala vs. Mrs. Qamar-un-Nisa Hakro through Attorney 
and another (PLD 2022 Singh 430), Dr. Shamshad 
Hussain Syed vs. District Consumer Court, Lahore and 
another (PLD 2010 Lahore 214) and Shifa International 
Hospitals Ltd. and others vs. Mst. Hajira Bibi and others 
(PLD 2018 Islamabad 372). 
5. 
Heard.  
6. 
Arguments 
advanced 
by 
the 
petitioners, 
if 
appreciated would result in rendering various provisions of 
Act 2005 redundant, which was neither intended through 
legislative endeavour in shape of Act 2010 nor could such 
an intent be implied. No inconsistency is found in the 
enactments, which clearly define the path and the 
destination. Upon perusal of both statutes no case for 
express or implied repeal is made out. Principles of 
harmonious construction are attracted and applicable. 
7. 
A bird’s eye view is imperative to understand the 
scope of the authority and powers available to the 
Commission and the Consumer Court, conspicuous 
distinctiveness in the functions to be performed and 
jurisdictional context, respectively enjoyed and exercised 
under each enactment. Section 2(k) of Act 2005 defines 
services, which inter alia included ‘medical services’; 
section 13 of Act 2005 defines liability in the context of 
faulty or defective services. Section 25 of Act 2005 
describes the nature of the claim, that is „A claim of 
damages arising out of the contravention of any provision 
of this Act shall be filed before a Consumer Court set up 
under this Act‟.  

W.P. No.2863/2024

8.  
Conversely, the scope of authority / control 
conferred unto the Commission under the Act 2010 is akin 
to a regulatory control – needed to be appreciated in the 
context that Commission is the regulator of the Healthcare 
Services establishment or service provided, being the 
licensee. There is no cavil that Commission is empowered 
to enquire and investigate into maladministration, 
malpractice and failure in provisioning of Healthcare 
services – section 4(e) of Act 2010 but in the capacity of 
regulator, ensuring improvement of quality of healthcare 
services. Commission may exercise powers on the 
application of the aggrieved person, which assumption and 
exercise of authority is evidently discretionary – 
distinction has been drawn vis-à-vis the application of the 
aggrieved person and a reference by the Government or 
direction by Constitutional Court(s), sub-section (7) of 
section 4 of Act, 2010. Fundamental difference in 
assumption and exercise of jurisdiction is with respect to 
orders Commission could pass, in the context of the 
grievance raised, if it acted upon the application of the 
aggrieved person. In terms of section 28 of the Act 2010, 
Commission is empowered to impose fine / penalty, in 
wake of contravention of any provision of Act 2010, which 
cannot exceed of Rs.500,000/-, depending upon the gravity 
of the offence. Use of expression ‘offence’ is section 28 of 
Act 2010 is meaningful.  
  
For the purposes of this case, complaint filed by 
respondent No.3 is not seeking imposition of penalty for 
any alleged offence committed by the Healthcare Services 
provider but damages for faulty and defective services. 
Services rendered being the licensee and services rendered  
towards the hirer or consumer are different and this 
distinction sheds light on the distinctiveness of the 

W.P. No.2863/2024 
 
-:5:- 
 
 
enactments and scope of powers defined therein. A 
consumer can file a claim of damages before the Consumer 
Court and simultaneously seek indulgence of the regulator 
/ licensor for action against licensee. Section 29 of Act 
2010 has to be construed in the context of the authority of 
the Commission, which provision of law cannot be 
employed to restrict or discourage claim of damages. 
Choices of the hirer of services cannot be limited for 
seeking penalty only but evidently the option of subjecting 
service provider to contractual or tortuous damages is 
otherwise available before the Consumer Court or the Civil 
Court, depending upon the facts of the case. These two 
streams of remedies manifest true intent of the legislature 
and address the purpose/objective of each of the 
enactment.  
9. 
Learned counsel for petitioners failed to convince 
that how damages could be granted by the Commission 
under the Act 2010. Argument that no claim of damages 
could be filed unless allegation of maladministration or 
malpractice is adjudicated upon and endorsed by the 
Commission is misconceived. Role of the Commission to 
act as gatekeeper for determining the existence and pursuit 
of damages is mere figment of imagination, and not 
conceived by the provisions of Act 2010. Learned counsel 
for the petitioner failed to give any explanation when 
confronted with the mandate of sub-section (11) of section 
4 of Act, 2010, which reads as,  
“The Commission shall not investigate or inquire 
into any matter subjudice before a Court of 
competent jurisdiction on the date of the receipt of a 
complaint. Reference or motions.”  
10. 
Reliance of the petitioner on sub-clause (2) of 
section 26  of Act, 2010 is also misconceived, when 

W.P. No.2863/2024 
 
-:6:- 
 
 
considered in the context of the narrative in paragraphs 
supra. Learned counsel for the petitioners concedes that 
complaint of respondent No.3 does not fall within the 
context of medical negligence, as contemplated and 
defined in the Act of 2010. 
11. 
Learned counsel emphasized on the ratio settled in 
the case of Dr. Riaz Qadeer Khan vs. Presiding Officer, 
District Consumer Court, Sargodha and others (PLD 2019 
Lahore 429), without appreciating that therein claim 
pleaded before the Consumer Court was regarding medical 
negligence. Penultimate paragraph of decision in the case 
of Dr. Riaz Qadeer Khan‟s (supra) is relevant and calls for 
reproduction, which reads as, 
“For what has been discussed above, we are 
persuaded to hold that Healthcare Commission is 
the only competent forum to investigate into the 
allegations of maladministration or malpractice by 
a health service provider and the Consumer Court 
has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon such matters. 
Resultantly, all these writ petitions are allowed and 
the 
complaints 
pending 
before 
the 
learned 
Consumer Court are directed to be returned for its 
presentation before the appropriate forum.”  
 
 
 
 
 
[Emphasis supplied] 
  
It is evident that in wake of allegations of 
maladministration or malpractice by the Health service 
provider, the Commission and not the Consumer Court has 
the jurisdiction, to impose penalty or pass other 
consequential orders, which per se excludes claim of 
damages 
from 
the 
jurisdictional 
domain 
of 
the 
Commission. It is interesting that one of the Judges-in-
Chambers being co-signatory of the decision in the case of 
Dr. Riaz Qadeer Khan‟s, has authored the decision dated 
19.12.2023 while deciding RFA No.70634/2023 (supra), 
wherein pertinent observations are made by learned 
Division Bench, which are reproduced hereunder:- 

W.P. No.2863/2024 
 
-:7:- 
 
 
“The 
Punjab 
Healthcare 
Commission 
can 
investigate into the allegations of malpractice of 
failure on the part of healthcare service provider 
and can announced order in this regard but it has 
no jurisdiction to grant damages to a person 
affected by such service whereas said relief can only 
be granted by the Civil Court if an aggrieved person 
proves his case. Furthermore, under the Act ibid 
even no bar has been imposed upon an aggrieved 
person to approach Civil Court for claim of 
damages against any healthcare service provider. 
As such the argument of learned counsel for the 
respondent have no force and same is repelled.”    
12. 
It is evident that learned author Judge-in-Chambers 
provided requisite explanation, observing that claim of 
damages is distinguishable from the power to impose 
penalty, 
jurisdiction 
otherwise 
extended 
to 
the 
Commission under the law. Yes, as far as the question of 
imposition of penalty by the regulator, Commissions may 
claim exclusivity to the extent thereof. The ratio settled in 
the case of Dr. Muhammad Asif Osawala (supra) also 
provides 
an 
insight 
into 
distinctive 
jurisdictional 
domain(s), respectively available to the Commission and 
Consumer Court, and scope thereof. 
13. 
In view of the aforesaid, this petition is devoid of 
merits and same is hereby dismissed. It is pertinent to 
observe that any observation herein made is solely for the 
purposes of deciding the case, which shall neither 
prejudice determination of the claim before Consumer 
Court nor affect the case of any party.
