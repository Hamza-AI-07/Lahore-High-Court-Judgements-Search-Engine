Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 has been filed with the 
following prayer: - 
“In view of the above facts and submissions, it is 
therefore, most respectfully prayed that instant petition may 
kindly be accepted and the impugned detention order of the 
detainee bearing No.HC(G)/1823 dated 10.05.2023, passed 
by respondent No.3, be declared illegal, unconstitutional and 
null and void upon the rights of the detainee, hence, liable to 
be quashed and also issue appropriate directions to the 
respondents to release the detainee from the jail at once. 
Any other relief which this Honourable Court may 
deem fit and appropriate under the given circumstances may 
also be awarded to the petitioner. ” 
 
2. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that real brother of the 
petitioner namely “Zeeshan Razzaq” has been arrested and detained vide 
aforementioned impugned order passed under Section: 3 (1) of the West Pakistan 
Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960 for a period of 30-days by Deputy 
Commissioner, Narowal/respondent No.3; further adds that there is no 
evidence/material available against him to show that he was acting or was about to 
act in a manner which was prejudicial to public safety or maintenance of public 
order; also adds that respondent No.3 has passed the impugned order (mentioned 
above) merely on the basis of asking/recommendations of District Police Officer, 

Writ Petition No.34019/2023       
 
 
 
 
             
        2 
                              
Narowal/respondent No.4 and without application of his own mind; finally prays 
that aforementioned impugned order is against the law as well as facts of the case, 
therefore, same is liable to be set-aside.  
3. 
 
On the other hand, learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab 
while producing report & parawise comments to this petition prepared by Deputy 
Commissioner, Narowal/respondent No.3 as well as report and parawise comments 
to this petition prepared by District Police Officer, Narowal/respondent No.4 (which 
have been placed on record of instant petition) and supporting the impugned order 
submits that since detenu has not availed alternative/departmental remedy by filing 
representation before the Government of Punjab, therefore, instant petition is not 
maintainable; finally adds that impugned order is in accordance with law and 
instant petition is liable to be dismissed.  
4.   
 
Arguments heard and available record perused.  
5.   
 
As far as objection raised by learned Assistant Advocate General, 
Punjab with respect to maintainability of instant petition due to non-filing of 
representation by the detenu before Government of Punjab, is concerned, suffice it 
to say that right to file petition of instant nature i.e. habeas corpus is remedy 
provided by the constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 in all matters of 
illegal confinement as one of fundamental rights; it goes without saying that if 
arrest of a person for the purpose of “Preventive Detention” cannot be justified in 
the eyes of law, then there is no reason that why said person should not invoke 
jurisdiction of this Court for his immediate release; in this regard, case of  
“Muhammad Irshad versus Government of the Punjab and others”  
(2020 P Cr.L J 206) and “Abdul Rauf versus Govt. of Punjab, etc.” 
(2023 LHC 2697) can be advantageously referred; relevant portion from former 
case law is hereby reproduced: - 
“I also do not agree with the learned Law Officer that prior to 
filing the writ petition against the order of detention, it is 
necessary to assail the same before the Secretary, Home 
Department, Lahore (Punjab). Reliance is placed on “Abdul Latif 
Shamshad Ahmad v. District Magistrate, Kasur” (1999 PCr.LJ 
2014) in which by tackling such legal observation the Hon’ble 
Bench observed as under: - 
 
“At the very outset I would express that before the filing 
of this writ petition, the making of the representation or 
preference of appeal before the Secretary Home 
Department, Government of the Punjab is not 
necessary. It has been held in Maulana Shah Ahmad 
Noorani v. Government of the Punjab PLD 1984 Lah. 
222 and Azad Papers (Jasarat) v. Province of Sindh 
and others PLD 1974 Kar. 81 that availability of 
alternate remedy of making representation to the 

Writ Petition No.34019/2023       
 
 
 
 
             
        3 
                              
provincial Government against the impugned order 
does not oust and eclipse the jurisdiction of the 
Constitutional Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction 
in a matter of the instant nature. This objection of the 
learned Assistant Advocate General is overruled.” 
Reliance is also placed on the cases of “Mst. Sana Jamil v. 
Government of the Punjab through Secretary and 5 others” (2016 
PCr.LJ 424) and “Syed Mubbashar Raza v. Government of 
Punjab through Secretary Home Department and 2 others”  (PLD 
2015 Lahore 20). Keeping in view the law laid down in judgment 
supra the objection of the learned AAG is overruled.” 
 
Therefore, objection (mentioned above) is overruled and instant petition is 
maintainable.  
6.  
 
Now coming to the merits of the case, it has been noticed that 
Deputy Commissioner, Narowal/respondent No.3 has passed the impugned order 
No.HC(G)/1823 dated: 10.05.2023 qua petitioner’s brother namely Zeeshan 
Razzaq under Section: 3 (1) of the West Pakistan Maintenance of Public order 
Ordinance, 1960 merely on the recommendations of District Police Officer, 
Narowal/respondent No.4 and relevant portion of report & parawise comments 
submitted on behalf of Deputy Commissioner, Narowal/respondent No.3 is 
reproduced for ready reference: -  
“It is submitted that the District Police Officer, Narowal through 
his letter No. 1203/SB dated 10/05/2023 (Annex-1) intimated that 
Zeeshan Razzaq W/O Abdul Razzaaq, Caste Pathan, R/O Bara 
Manga, Tehsil Shakargarh, District Narowal was delivering 
speeches against Pakistan Government, National Security 
Agencies and was instigating/provoking the people to create law & 
order situation. There was strong apprehension that the said 
Individual might exploit the public sentiments with the objective to 
commit violence, deliver unlawful speeches to cause civil 
commotion and damage the human live, Govt./public properties, to 
overawe the Government and to obstruct the Government 
machinery in discharging its lawful functions/duties which might 
led to lawlessness and anarchy. Accordingly, DPO Narowal 
recommended that In order to prevent the said anti-social element 
from his unlawful activities and acting in a manner prejudicial to 
the public safety and maintenance of public order, the said that 
Zeeshan Razzaq W/O Abdul Razzaaq be detained for a period of 
30 days. Therefore, in view of the recommendation of the DPO 
Narowal and in order to prevent the said Individual from acting in 
any manner prejudicial to the public safety and maintenance of 
public order, that Zeeshan Razzaq W/O Abdul Razzaaq was 
detained vide order No. HC(G)/1823 dated 10/05/2023 for a 
period of 30 days from the date of his entrance in district Jail 
Narowal In terms of section 3(1) of the Maintenance of Public 
Order, 1960 to avoid any likelihood of breach of peace/unlawful 
assembly in the district (Annex-II).” 
 
Similarly, relevant portion of the report of District Police Officer, 
Narowal/respondent No.4, is also reproduced below: - 

Writ Petition No.34019/2023       
 
 
 
 
             
        4 
                              
“2.  
It is further submitted that as per report of Incharge 
Security of this office Zeeshan Razzaq s/o Abdul Razzaq caste 
Pathan r/o Bara Manga, Tehsil Shakargarh, District Narowal was 
delivering speeches against Government of Pakistan, National 
Security Agencies and persuading the people to create law & order 
situation in the District. Therefore, there was apprehension that he 
may exploit the public sentiment with the object to commit 
violence, deliver unlawful speeches to cause civil commotion and 
damage to human life, Government/public properties, to overawe 
the government and to obstruct the Government Machinery in 
discharging lawful functions/duties and his free movement was 
likely to disturb the public peace, safety and tranquility which may 
lead to anarchy in the country. Due to above said circumstances 
and in order to prevent the said anti social element and his 
unlawful activities and to maintain the public order, he was 
recommended to be kept in detention in the best interest of public 
peace. 
3.  
Consequently, Deputy Commissioner, Narowal vide order. 
WHCIG)/1823 dated 10.05.2023 (copy enclosed Annex-'A') has 
detained Zeeshan Razzaq s/o Abdul Razzaq caste Pathan r/o Bara 
Manga, Tehsil Ghakargarh, District Narowal for a period of 30 
days from the date of his entrance in District Jail Narowal to avoid 
any likelihood of breach of peace/unlawful assembly, please. 
  
Report is submitted for kind perusal, please.” 
 
It is trite law that before passing detention order of a person under Section: 3 of 
the Ordinance ibid, the competent authority must have reasons to believe that said 
person within his territorial jurisdiction has acted, is acting or is about to act in a 
manner which is prejudicial to public safety or maintenance of public order; 
however, perusal of the available record reveals that allegations against the detenu 
is general in nature i.e. he was delivering speeches against Government of 
Pakistan, National Security Agencies and persuading the people to create law & 
order situation in the district but any solid or cogent evidence/material in order to 
establish the same, was not produced before Deputy Commissioner, Narowal/ 
respondent No.3 at the time of passing impugned order (mentioned above); 
furthermore, any audio/video recording of speech, voice transcript in said regard 
or exact wording in written form of the same has not been mentioned in the 
impugned order as well as reports and parawise comments  (mentioned above) and 
even any such like material/evidence has not been produced today before the 
Court; it is also not out of place to mention here that except aforementioned 
recommendations of District Police Officer, Narowal/respondent No.4, there is no 
material available against the detenu to establish that he was acting or was about to 
act in any manner, which was prejudicial to the public safety or maintenance of 
the public order. Learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab (on Court’s query) 
could not refer or produce any material to prove that detenu is member of any 
banned group, proscribed organization or involved in any anti-State activities. 

Writ Petition No.34019/2023       
 
 
 
 
             
        5 
                              
Even perusal of report of District Police Officer, Narowal/respondent No.4 does 
not reflect any material to invoke sub-section (1) of Section: 3 of the Ordinance 
ibid except apprehensions. But mere apprehension without any valid reason and 
also not supported by any cogent material, cannot be allowed to be made basis for 
curtailing right/liberty or freedom of any citizen which is even otherwise 
guaranteed by the constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.  Learned 
Assistant Advocate General, Punjab under instructions of police official (present 
in Court) submits that any criminal case regarding alleged speeches against 
Government of Pakistan, has not been registered against the detenu. In the 
circumstances, mere apprehension cannot be per se made basis for issuance of 
impugned detention order. It goes without saying that when law requires a thing to 
be done in a particular manner, it should have been done in that manner otherwise 
same would be deemed as illegal in the light of maxim “A communi observantia 
non est recedendum” and in this regard case of “Muhammad Zafar Iqbal 
versus Sadozai Khan and two others” (2021 YLR 1206) and case of “Maqsood 
Yameen versus R.P.O. Multan and others” (2015 PCr.LJ 923) can be referred. 
7.  
 
In view of what has been discussed above, it is crystal clear that the 
impugned detention order No.HC(G)/1823 dated: 10.05.2023 has been passed 
against the settled principles of law on the subject as well as relevant facts; 
therefore, same is set aside, and Zeeshan Razzaq (detenu/brother of the petitioner) 
is ordered to be released forthwith, if not required in any other case. Instant 
petition stands accepted.
