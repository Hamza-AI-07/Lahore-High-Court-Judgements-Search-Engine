Judge in Chambers in Writ Petition No.3254 of 2016, 
whereby the Petition filed by the respondents No.5 to 15

by

ICA No.49 of 2023 
 
application on 03.05.2014 (inadvertently 
mentioned 
as 
10.09.2014 in the order dated 28.02.2023, passed by the learned Single 
Judge in Chambers)  before the Commissioner/Chairman 
Divisional Verification Committee constituted under 
notification No.705-2010-74/0.1.R. dated 06.05.2011, 
alleging therein that Hamid Ali (predecessor-in-interest 
of the respondents No.5 to 15) was not the owner of the 
land through any valid order or document, but the revenue 
staff, without any order of the competent authority, 
showed him as owner in possession of land measuring 
544 kanals 18 marlas in Mouza Uch Moghla, 200 kanals 
in Mouza Makhdoompur, 72 kanals 19 marlas in Mouza 
Rasulpur, 46 kanals in Mouza Budhwali and 130 kanals 7 
marlas in Mouza Uch Bukhari since 1959-60, and entered 
inheritance mutations on the basis of RL II No.1, 6, 9, 34, 
37, 76, 84, 87 and as such the same were required to be 
verified. This application was marked to respondent No.2 
namely Additional District Collector /Member Divisional 
Verification Committee, on whose direction a detailed 
report dated 08.09.2014 was filed by respondent No.3 
namely Assistant Commissioner , Ahmedpur East, 
according to which entries regarding names, casts and the 
mutations were declared bogus and requiring verification. 
Respondent No.2 namely Additional District Collector 
/Member Divisional Verification Committee, having 
gone through the report dated 08.09.2014 as submitted by 
respondent No.3 namely Assistant Commissioner, 

3 
ICA No.49 of 2023 
 
Ahmedpur East, vide order dated 13.09.2014, directed the 
respondent No.3 namely Assistant Commissioner, 
Ahmedpur East, to implement the order dated 13.09.2014 
and to scrutinize the matter of the title of the houses 
No.121 to 126  and prepare a detailed report for 
submission to the Chairman Verification Committee so 
that the same could be determined. The respondents No.5 
to 15 filed the Writ Petition No.3254 of 2016, and vide 
order dated 28.02.2023 passed by the learned Single 
Judge in Chambers, the same was allowed and the order 
dated 13.09.2014 passed by respondent No.2 namely 
Additional District Collector /Member Divisional 
Verification Committee, Bahawalpur was set aside being 
illegal and void as having been passed without 
jurisdiction, hence this appeal. 
3. 
The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that 
the learned Single Judge in Chambers had erred in facts 
and law while passing the order dated 28.02.2023. The 
learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that 
the learned Single Judge in Chambers lacked the 
jurisdiction to pass the impugned order. The learned 
counsel for the appellant also submitted that the 
respondent No.2 namely Additional District Collector 
/Member 
Divisional 
Verification 
Committee, 
Bahawalpur had the jurisdiction to pass the order dated 
13.09.2014. The learned counsel for the appellant further 
submitted that the learned Single Judge in Chambers did 

4 
ICA No.49 of 2023 
 
not consider the impact of the dismissal of the suit and 
appeal as filed by the respondents No.5 to 15 regarding 
the same property. 
4. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant 
and perused the record.  
5.   Admittedly as per the facts, the appellant,  filed an 
application on 03.05.2014 (inadvertently 
mentioned 
as 
10.09.2014 in the order dated 28.02.2023, passed by the learned Single 
Judge in Chambers)  before the Commissioner/Chairman 
Divisional Verification Committee constituted under 
notification No.705-2010-74/0.1.R. dated 06.05.2011, 
alleging therein that Hamid Ali (predecessor-in-interest 
of the respondents No.5 to 15) was not the owner of the 
land through any valid order or document, but the revenue 
staff, without any order of the competent authority, 
showed him as owner in possession of land measuring 
544 kanals 18 marlas in Mouza Uch Moghla, 200 kanals 
in Mouza Makhdoompur, 72 kanals 19 marlas in Mouza 
Rasulpur, 46 kanals in Mouza Budhwali and 130 kanals 7 
marlas in Mouza Uch Bukhari since 1959-60, and entered 
inheritance mutations on the basis of RL II No.1, 6, 9, 34, 
37, 76, 84, 87 and as such the same were required to be 
verified. The appellant in his application did not name 
Hatim Ali and Sajida Begum though they were also   the 
predecessors-in-interest of the respondents No.5 to 15 and 
the respondent No.2 namely Additional District Collector 
/Member Divisional Verification Committee passed the 

5 
ICA No.49 of 2023 
 
order dated 13.09.2014 regarding the property of Hatim 
Ali and Sajida Begum ( the predecessors-in-interest of the 
respondents No.5 to 15) also. This application of the 
appellant was marked to respondent No.2 namely 
Additional District Collector /Member Divisional 
Verification Committee, on whose direction a detailed 
report dated 08.09.2014 was filed by respondent No.3 
namely Assistant Commissioner, Ahmedpur East, 
according to which entries regarding names, casts and the 
mutations were declared bogus and requiring verification. 
Respondent No.2 namely Additional District Collector 
/Member Divisional Verification Committee, having 
gone through the report dated 08.09.2014 as submitted by 
the respondent No.3 namely Assistant Commissioner , 
Ahmedpur East, vide order dated 13.09.2014, directed the 
respondent No.3 namely Assistant Commissioner , 
Ahmedpur East, to implement the order dated 13.09.2014 
and further directed to scrutinize the matter of the title of 
the houses No.121 to 126  and prepare a detailed report 
for submission to the Chairman Verification Committee 
so that the same could be determined. The application ,as 
mentioned above, was submitted by the appellant on 
03.05.2014 to the Commissioner/Chairman Divisional 
Verification Committee. The provisions of the Evacuee 
Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975 
in this regard are clear and unambiguous. When we go 
through the wording of section 2 of the Evacuee Property 

6 
ICA No.49 of 2023 
 
and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act (XIV of 1975), 
it clearly provides that all proceedings relating to evacuee 
property which were pending on the cutoff date, that is, 
30.06.1974 or any matter which was pending before a 
superior court in appeal or revision, or which was pending 
because of remand by a superior court, at the time of 
Repeal of Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws 
(Repeal) Act (XIV of 1975) will fall within the definition 
of pending cases. Only such matters, which were either 
actively pending consideration before Authorities for 
final disposal or had been remanded by the High Court or 
Supreme Court, were to be finalized by the Notified 
Officer. Settlement or Rehabilitation Authorities, by 
express positive assertion had no jurisdiction to entertain 
any fresh petition or representation. Where question of 
entitlement concerning agricultural property was neither 
remanded by Supreme Court nor any such directions were 
made by the High Court whereby Notified Officer on its 
strength could commence proceedings, any petition or 
representation filed with regard to matter which otherwise 
stood finalized long back or even where aggrieved person 
might believe to have legitimate claim, could not be 
entertained by Chief Settlement Commissioner or 
Notified Officer or any other Settlement Authority by 
virtue of Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws 
(Repeal) Act, 1975. Section 2 of the Evacuee Property 
and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act (XIV of 

7 
ICA No.49 of 2023 
 
1975),before being amended through the Evacuee 
Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) 
(Amendment) Act 2022 (XXI of 2022), read as under :- 
“2.   Repeal of certain laws.– (1) The following Acts and 
Regulations are hereby repealed, namely:- 
(i)            the Registration of Claims (Displaced Persons) 
Act, 1956 (III of 1956); 
(ii)        the Pakistan Rehabilitation Act, 1956 (XLII of 1956); 
(iii)       the Pakistan (Administration of Evacuee Property) 
Act, 1957 (XII of 1957); 
(iv)       the Displaced Persons (Compensation and 
Rehabilitation) Act, 1958 (XXVIII of 1958); 
(v)        the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 1958 
(XLVII of 1958); 
(vi)       the Scrutiny of Claims (Evacuee Property) 
Regulation, 1961; and 
(vii)      the Price of Evacuee Property and Public Dues 
(Recovery) Regulation, 1971. 
 (2)     Upon the repeal of the aforesaid Acts and Regulations, 
all proceedings which, immediately before such repeal, 
may be pending before the authorities appointed thereunder 
shall stand transferred for final disposal to such officers as 
may be notified by the Government in the official Gazette 
and all cases decided by the Supreme Court or the Lahore 
High Court after such repeal which would have been 
remanded to any such authority in the absence of such repeal 
shall be remanded to the officers notified as aforesaid” 
 

8 
ICA No.49 of 2023 
 
The appellant moved the application on 03.05.2014 i.e.  
after 39 years of Repeal of Evacuee Property and 
Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act (XIV of 1975). 
Therefore, we are of the considered view that the 
application of the appellant could not be considered as  a 
pending case under  the Evacuee Property and Displaced 
Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975 . Reliance is placed on 
the case of “Muhammad Din Versus The Deputy 
Settlement Commissioner” (2022 SCMR 1481) wherein 
the august Supreme Court Of Pakistan has held as 
under:- 
“10.  There is no cavil to the legal stance taken by the learned 
counsel for the Appellant that in case any proceedings 
relating to evacuee property is pending on the cutoff date, 
that is, 30.06.1974, the officer notified under section 2(2) of 
the Repealing Act was competent to proceed and decide the 
same in accordance with the repealed laws. However, there 
is nothing on the record of the present case that the 
application made by the Appellant to the Chief Settlement 
Commissioner for cancellation of the PTD (Exh-P7), 
wherein the Deputy Settlement Commissioner had filed the 
report (Exh-P15), was pending on the cutoff date. The mere 
pendency of the application of the Appellant, before the 
Deputy Settlement Commissioner, for transfer of the suit 
property to him under Scheme No. VIII could not make the 
issue of the validity of the PTD (Exh-P7) alive and bring it 
within the scope of a "pending proceeding" under section 2 
of the Repealing Act. In absence of any such pending 
proceeding as to the validity of the PTD (Exh-P7), the 
notified Deputy Settlement Commissioner rightly referred 

9 
ICA No.49 of 2023 
 
the Appellant to have recourse to Civil Court to get adjudged 
the validity of the PTD (Exh-P7). It hardly needs reiteration 
that after the promulgation of the Repealing Act, the officers 
notified under that Act, do not possess the jurisdiction to 
declare any PTO or PTD regarding which no proceedings 
were pending on the cutoff date, as null and void on the 
grounds of alleged fraud or forgery; they can only deal with 
and decide the pending proceedings and cannot initiate any 
new proceeding. Anyone who wants to challenge any PTO 
or PTD issued under the repealed laws, and has locus standi 
to do so, is to knock at the doors of Civil Court, a court of 
plenary jurisdiction, for the redress of his grievance.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of "Nawabzada Zafar 
Ali 
Khan 
and 
others 
v. 
Chief 
Settlement 
Commissioner/Member Board of Revenue, Punjab 
Lahore and others”, reported as 1999 SCMR 1719. 
6.     We have also considered that by virtue of 18th 
Amendment in the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973, the Evacuee Property and Displaced 
Persons Laws (Repeal) Act (XIV of 1975) was adapted, 
with amendments, for the province of the Punjab by the 
Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) 
(Amendment) Act 2012 (XXXVIII of 2012) and though 
an amendment has been made in section 2 of the Evacuee 
Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 
1975 through the Evacuee Property and Displaced 
Persons Laws (Repeal) (Amendment) Act 2022 (XXI of 
2022) and section 2(A) has been added according to 
which all properties allotted after the repeal of the Acts 
and Regulations mentioned in subsection (1) shall be 

10 
ICA No.49 of 2023 
 
subject to scrutiny at any time, and after observing due 
process of law, if it is found that any land or property was 
allotted in contravention of any law or through fraud, 
forgery or misrepresentation, such allotment shall be 
cancelled however the property in the instant case had 
been allotted much before the repeal of the Acts and 
Regulations by the Evacuee Property and Displaced 
Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975. According to the 
facts, the land was transferred in the names of Hamid Ali, 
Hatim Ali and Sajida Begum (the predecessors-in-
interest of the respondents No.5 to 15) during the period 
1963 to 1970. Furthermore an amendment has been 
made in the section 2 (2) of the Evacuee Property and 
Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975 through the 
Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) 
(Amendment) Act 2022 (XXI of 2022)  and now section 
2(2) provides that all proceedings pending before any 
notified officer immediately before the commencement 
of the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws 
(Repeal)  (Amendment) Act 2022, shall stand transferred 
for final disposal to the Full Board, and all cases decided 
by the Supreme Court  or the Lahore High Court after the  
commencement of the said Act of 2022 which would 
have been remanded to the notified officer shall be 
remanded to the Full Board. Full Board means                     
the    Full      Board    consisting   of      three     Members  

11 
ICA No.49 of 2023 
 
of the Board of Revenue, constituted by the Senior 
Member, Board of Revenue from time to time. In this 
case the order was passed by the respondent No.2 namely 
Additional District Collector /Member Divisional 
Verification Committee, Bahawalpur who had no 
jurisdiction in the matter, and not by  Full Board as 
defined under section 1A (aa) of  the Evacuee Property  
and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975 as 
inserted by the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons 
Laws (Repeal) (Amendment) Act 2022 (XXI of 2022). 
The learned counsel for the appellant has been unable to 
point out any illegality or excess of jurisdiction having 
been committed by the learned Single Judge in 
Chambers while passing the impugned order dated 
28.02.2023. We find that the impugned order dated 
28.02.2023 has been passed by the learned Single Judge 
in Chambers after going through the record of the case 
and taking into consideration the facts and circumstances 
of the case.  
7.      
In view of the above discussion, this appeal 
being devoid of merit, is dismissed in limine.
