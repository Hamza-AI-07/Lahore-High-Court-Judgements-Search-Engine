Date of Hearing: 
21.10.2024  
Appellant by: 
Mr. Muhammad Maalik Khan Langah, 
Advocate.  
Respondents 
No.1 & 2 by: 
Malik Javed Akhtar Wains, Advocate 
assisted by Ms. Aqsa Zahid, Advocate.  
Muhammad Asadullah Khan, Respondent 
No.2 in person. 
Respondent No.6 
by: 
Mr. Mumtaz Fazal Mirza, Advocate.  
 
Anwaar Hussain, J. Through this single judgment, the 
present as well as connected appeal, bearing RFA No.270/2019, are 
simultaneously being decided as both these appeals are directed 
against the same judgment and decree dated 09.11.2019 vide which 
the suit for declaration with permanent injunction instituted by the 
appellant in the present appeal (“the appellant”) was dismissed, 
whereas the suit for specific performance of contract instituted by 
respondents No.1 & 2 (“the respondents”) was decreed. The 
connected appeal has been preferred by respondent No.6, namely, 
Naseer Ahmed, who is step-brother of the appellant.  
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
respondents purportedly entered into an agreement to sell dated 
03.02.2014 (“the agreement”) with the appellant in respect of land, 
measuring 15 kanal 17 marla, situated in Mauza Neel Kot Tehsil 
City, Multan for which the suit for specific performance was 
instituted, whereas the appellant instituted the suit for declaration 

RFA No.267/2019  
2
with permanent injunction regarding the suit property with the 
averments that the agreement is result of fraud.  
3. 
It is the case of the appellant that he had been residing abroad 
for approximately 45 years and respondent No.1, namely, Amanullah 
Khan Durrani Saduzai was his class-fellow and a close friend and on 
account of said cordial relationship, the appellant appointed 
respondent No.1 as his special attorney to pursue suit for declaration 
titled “Naseer Ahmed v. Nasir Ahmed”, which was instituted by the 
appellant of the connected appeal, bearing RFA No.270/2019, and in 
the garb of execution of the said attorney, forged documents 
including the agreement were prepared, which are liable to be so 
declared and cancelled. Conversely, it is the case of the respondents 
that the appellant sold land measuring 86 marla @ Rs.600,000/- per 
marla to respondent No.1 and 09 kanal-14 marla at the rate of 
Rs.225,000/- per marla to the respondents (the total amount was to 
be calculated as per final measurement of the total land) and sum of 
Rs.5,000,000/- was paid at the time of execution of the agreement 
whereas for the purpose of payment of balance consideration 
amount, cut-off-date was fixed as 03.02.2015. The respondents claim 
that Rs.16,000,000/- (Exh.D2), Rs.15,500,000/- (Exh.D3) and 
Rs.14,000,000/- (Exh.D4) were paid on 04.02.2014, 30.01.2015 and 
05.02.2014, respectively. Additionally, an amount of US $ 42,000/- 
was also transferred in the bank account of the appellant and the 
respondents remained willing to clear the balance sale consideration, 
however, when the appellant did not receive the same, the suit for 
specific performance was instituted. Both the suits were 
consolidated, and issues were accordingly framed, whereafter the 
evidence was led and recorded. Admittedly, after the decree was 
passed in favour of the respondents, the balance sale consideration 
amounting to Rs.40,250,000/- has also been deposited by the 
respondents.  
4. 
Learned counsel for the appellant contends that the agreement 
is forged and so are the payment receipts brought on record as 

RFA No.267/2019  
3
Exh.D2, Exh.D3 and Exh.D4, which could not be proved in 
accordance with the mandate of Article 17 read with Article 79 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (“QSO”).  
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents supported the 
impugned judgment and decree, however, states that even if the 
receipts, brought on record as Exh.D2, Exh.D3 and Exh.D4, could 
not be proved in accordance with mandate of Article 17 read with 79 
of the QSO, the agreement stood proved and the respondents are 
always ready and willing to pay the aggregate amount forming part 
of the said receipts as the respondents have not only paid the earnest 
money but also transferred US $ 42,000/-, which the appellant is 
utilizing for the last more than a decade and the balance sale 
consideration of Rs.40,250,000/- has also been deposited after 
passing of the impugned judgment and decree that constitute 
substantial performance of the agreement.  
6. 
On behalf of respondent No.6 – the appellant in the connected 
appeal, it has been argued that the suit property is joint in nature and 
the decree can only operate to the extent of actual share of the 
appellant for which proper partition proceedings are required to be 
carried out in accordance with law.  
7. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
8. 
Out of the divergent pleadings of the parties, vide order dated 
18.12.2018, following consolidated issues were framed by the Trial

9. 
In view of the arguments advanced before us, following are the 
core points of determination before this Court:  
(i) 
Whether the agreement was executed and proved 
in accordance with Article 17 read Article 79 of 
the QSO? 

RFA No.267/2019  
6
(ii) 
If the agreement stood proved, whether the 
receipts were proved in accordance with law? If 
not, what are the consequences? 
10. 
Insofar as first point of determination is concerned, it is 
imperative to note that the appellant took the stance that he wanted to 
appoint respondent No.1, namely, Amanullah Khan Durrani Saduzai 
as his special attorney for which stamp paper bearing No.8289 was 
obtained, and the said respondent must have cleverly obtained the 
signatures of the appellant on white papers, which were later on 
misused to prepare the agreement and the receipts. The averment and 
contention do not sit well with the record of the case, which reflects 
otherwise. It is also noted that the appellant in terms of order VI Rule 
4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 has not given the particulars 
and details as to how the fraud was committed since only one stamp 
paper was statedly got issued by the appellant and the same was used 
for the purpose of appointing respondent No.1 as his special attorney. 
Therefore, it is unclear as to what persuaded the appellant to affix his 
signatures on the blank white papers. In fact, factum of allegation of 
procuring signatures on the blank papers was not pleaded in suit for 
declaration, instituted on 06.04.2015, but casually mentioned while 
filing written statement, filed on 18.04.2015, in suit for specific 
performance instituted by the respondents. Moreover, when the 
appellant appeared as PW.1, he further improved his stance by 
stating that the blank white papers were signed by the appellant for 
the purpose of opening of the bank account and also in respect of the 
litigation with NHA, however, nowhere in the pleadings or in the 
evidence, the appellant has referred to any litigation with the NHA 
etc., and this fact rightly persuaded the Trial Court to hold that the 
agreement was executed by the appellant. Even otherwise, the said 
aspect of the evidence is beyond pleadings and it is settled law that 
evidence beyond pleadings cannot be read and considered. Operative 
part of the impugned judgment reads as under:  
“20. During the course of cross-examination PW-1 
admitted that the defendant No.1 belong to a financial 
and strong sound family, the alleged agreement to sell i.e. 

RFA No.267/2019  
7
Ex.D-1 was shown to PW-1, at page No.2 of the cross 
examination PW-1 admits that in his written statement 
filed in the suit titled as “Amanullah Khan vs Nasir 
Ahmad” on 27.07.2016, the plaintiff has not denied his 
signatures or thumb impression in the Exh.D-1. He 
further admitted that the marginal witnesses namely 
Malik Muhammad Asghar is his friend. PW-1 further 
stated that on 03.02.2014, he never appeared before 
Muhammad Faisal Siddique stamp vendor bearing 
license No.20 Pak gate Multan. However, in the second 
line he himself admitted that on 03.02.2014 he appeared 
before Muhammad Faisal Siddique and purchased a 
stamp paper for appointment of special attorney PW-1 is 
blowing hot and cold in the same breath. At page No.5 
of the cross-examination he states that on 03.02.2014 in 
garb of special attorney stamp vendor and the 
defendant No.1 obtained his signatures at different 
papers. He admitted it as correct that Exh.D-2 to Exh.D-
4 bears his signature as Exh.D2/1 to Exh.D4/1 are his 
signatures but are a result of same conspiracy. In the 
same breath, PW-1 states that on 03.02.2014 he signed 
white the paper for the litigation with NHA and for bank 
account and for transfer of money.  
21.  
Perusal of record reflects that nowhere in the 
pleadings or in the evidence, plaintiff has filed any 
litigation with the NHA.” 
The fact that the agreement was executed gets further traction 
inasmuch as the suit for declaration was filed on 06.04.2015 much 
prior to the suit for specific performance of the agreement instituted 
by the respondents, which raises the question as to how the appellant 
came to know that some fraud had been committed with him in 
February, 2014, when the appellant only wanted to appoint 
respondent No.1 as his special attorney. The appellant, while filing 
suit for declaration on 06.04.2015, claimed having knowledge of the 
fraudulent agreement since January 2015, without disclosing details 
of alleged fraud practised by the respondents. Why the appellant was 
economical with the truth and had not disclosed factum of alleged 
fraud is another demerit of the case of the appellant. This lapse, 
coupled with other shortcomings, conspicuously discredits the plea 
of non-signing of the agreement. This tumble also reflects a strange 
case of pre-emption based on presumption on the part of the 
appellant that the respondents might have procured the agreement 

RFA No.267/2019  
8
fraudulently. Moreover, it is evident from the perusal of Exh.D16, 
which is copy of the application submitted for intimating factum of 
cancellation of special power of attorney, wherein factum of alleged 
fraud was not stated but plea of some personal disputes was raised, as 
the reason for cancellation. When confronted, there was no plausible 
explanation available with learned counsel for the appellant for such 
lapses in stance of the appellant. Therefore, we are of the opinion 
that the agreement was duly executed and proved, and denial on the 
part of the appellant is an unsubstantiated attempt to shirk away for 
performance of established contractual obligations. 
11. 
Insofar as the second point of determination is concerned, it is 
imperative to state that the appeals were variously heard at length, by 
this Court, in the month of January 2024. One of the contested issues 
was that whether payment of part consideration amount, pursuant to 
the agreement, and claimed to have had paid by the respondents 
through Exh.D2, Exh.D3 & Exh.D4, stood proved. The appellant 
contested the claim of the receipt of part consideration. We, in 
exercise of powers under Order XLI Rule 25 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure 1908 and in order to ascertain genuineness of the receipts, 
had framed an additional issue and directed the Trial Court to refer 
the questioned documents to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency for 
verification of the signatures of the appellant, inter alia, by 
comparison with appellant’s Passport/Identity Card for Overseas 
Pakistanis. We further directed the Trial Court to record expert 
evidence, enable parties to cross-examine witnesses, and record 
findings on the additional issue, for our consideration. For quick 
comprehension, the additional issue is reproduced hereunder: 
Whether purported signatures of Nasir Ahmad 
on receipts, Exh.D-2, Exh.D-3 and Exh.D-4 are 
genuine? [Onus on the parties] 
  
The Trial Court recorded the evidence and submitted the order 
with inconclusive findings, for the reasons stated. Paragraphs 8, 9, 10 
and 11 of the order of the Trial Court dated 22.06.2024 are 

RFA No.267/2019  
9
reproduced hereunder, which have had relevance in the context of the 
conclusive findings recorded through the instant judgment:  
“8.  
CW-1/Forensic Scientist submitted her report and 
her observation was given on the report which is 
reproduced as under:- 
Result(s) & Conclusion(s): 
 
After careful examination and comparison 
of the Questioned Signatures of Nasir Ahmed 
Fiqia on items no.1.1 to 1.3 with routine 
signature of Nasir Ahmad Fiqia on item no.1.4, 
no conclusion could be drawn on the basis of 
provided evidence. 
Additional Comments: 
The term ‘no conclusion’ has been used in 
conclusion because only one routine signature of 
Nasir Ahmad Fiqia has been provided which is 
insufficient to establish natural range of 
variation (differences/variations in his own 
signature specimen). 
9. 
This court was directed by the Hon’ble High Court, 
Multan Bench, Multan vide order dated 24.01.2024 to 
procure report from the Agency, invite objections, call 
expert for evidence and enable parties to cross examine 
said witness. Furthermore, direction was also issued by the 
Hon’ble High Court to get record findings and reasons 
thereof. 
10. 
Instant case files were received to this court on 
01.02.2024. On 06.02.2024, Malik Jamshed Akhtar Wains 
Advocate, appeared on behalf of defendants No.1 & 2, Mr. 
Mumtaz Fazal Mirza Advocate appeared on behalf of 
defendant No.6 and Miss Najma Aziz Advocate appeared 
and submitted her memo of attendance on behalf of 
plaintiff Nasir Ahmad. Approximately eight adjournments 
were availed by the learned counsel for the plaintiff (Nasir 
Ahmad) for submission of passport of Nasir Ahmad On 
25.03.2024, passport of concerned Nasir Ahmad was 
submitted. Later on learned counsel for the defendants 
No.1 & 2 filed an application with the stance that 
concerned Nasir Ahmad plaintiff has submitted his 
passport which is already cancelled one. At the time of 
alleged disputed agreement to sell said passport was in 
filed. Furthermore, Nasir Ahmad never appeared before 
this court rather he appeared through his special attorney 
Miss Najma Aziz Advocate. CW-1 has got recorded her 

RFA No.267/2019  
10
statement that according to Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, she is unable 
to get comparison of signatures of Nasir Ahmad while 
relying upon only one document (passport). Report of 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency with no conclusion has 
been submitted. So, in the presence of report of no 
conclusion, this court is unable to get record any findings 
regarding genuineness of signatures of Nasir Ahmad on 
Exh.D-2, Exh.D-3 and Exh.D-4. 
11. 
In the light of my findings and reasons, report of 
Forensic Scientist was submitted with no conclusion. So, 
both these files of above said cases with due respect be 
placed before the Hon'ble Lahore High Court, Multan 
Bench, Multan for further necessary direction through the 
office of Worthy District & Sessions Judge, Multan. 
Ahlmad of this court is directed to transmit the files after 
its due completion and compilation.” 
Suffice to observe that we expressed our doubts qua the 
receipts, claiming payment of part consideration and extended 
opportunity to the parties to bring additional evidence to prove or 
disprove the factum of consideration, besides affording 
opportunity to the appellant to facilitate comparison of his 
signatures on questioned documents. Task assigned to the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency remained incomplete because sufficient 
signatures of the appellant were not available, and an exercise for 
undertaking comparison between questioned documents with 
admitted signatures could not be carried out. It is apparent from 
the order dated 22.06.2024 of the Trial Court, in the context of the 
additional issue, that the appellant was represented through 
attorney, and he had not appeared before the Trial Court during 
the proceedings, which remained pending therefrom February 
2024 to June 2024, to facilitate an exercise of comparison of the 
signatures. This lack of cooperation is contrary to the normal 
human conduct, in a like situation where the appellant is placed in 
context of the plea of denial of execution of the agreement and the 
receipts, and further suggests an adverse inference against the 
appellant. There is no cavil that presumption of fact is rebuttable, 
but in appropriate circumstances, it suggests an affirmative 
inference, when examined in the context of ordinary conduct of 

RFA No.267/2019  
11
human beings/ homo sapiens. Why would someone not step-
forward/appear and facilitate an exercise for conducting 
comparison of signatures, especially when his valuable property is 
at stake in the legal proceedings and the dispute relates to the 
genuineness or otherwise of the signatures – you can lead a horse 
to water but cannot make it drink. Absence of the appellant to 
facilitate task of comparison of signatures provides sufficient 
reasons for inferring presumption of fact against appellant–
conduct of the appellant is contrary to normal/ordinary human 
conduct. 
12.   Even otherwise, we have noticed that there were two 
witnesses of the receipt amounting to Rs.16,000,000/- (Exh.D2), 
namely, Malik Khair Muhammad and Muhammad Jameel Akhtar 
and out of them, Malik Khair Muhammad appeared before the 
Court in examination-in-chief but did not come in the witness box 
for cross-examination whereas the other witness, namely, 
Muhammad Jameel Akhtar appeared as DW.4. Same was the 
position with regard to witnesses of the receipt amounting to 
Rs.14,000,000/- (Exh.D4). As regards the receipt amounting to 
Rs.15,500,000/- (Exh.D3), there were two witnesses, namely, 
Allah Ditta and Muhammad Nadeem Khan Durrani and since 
Muhammad Nadeem Khan Durrani died, respondent No.1 himself 
appeared as DW.13 in secondary evidence. The Trial Court has 
erred in appreciating the fact that respondent No.1 himself 
appeared as DW.13 in secondary evidence to prove the signatures 
of deceased Muhammad Nadeem Khan Durrani on Exh.D3 by 
ignoring the fact that even though respondent No.1 was close 
relative of deceased Muhammad Nadeem Khan Durrani but he was 
not familiar with signatures of deceased Muhammad Nadeem 
Khan Durrani as they have neither worked together nor concluded 
any transaction between them. Therefore, we are of the opinion 
that the respondents were not able to prove the part payment of the 
balance sale consideration per Exh.D2, Exh.D3 and Exh.D4.   

RFA No.267/2019  
12
13. 
As regards amount of US$ 42,000/-, the same has been 
deposited, partly through internal transfer and partly by way of 
deposit through instrument of cheque, in the bank account of the 
appellant, however, it is the case of the appellant that it was 
deposited without consent of the appellant which averment is 
misconceived and not persuasive inasmuch as the payments were 
made in February, 2014 whereafter the appellant has been operating 
the bank account for his benefit and has not raised any objection qua 
the said payments/entries at any relevant forum. Bank Statements of 
the accounts were produced showing corresponding credit entries in 
the accounts of the appellant. Payment of consideration is one of the 
critical fact-in-issue, and the appellant failed to bring compelling 
evidence to dispute existence of the beneficial entries in his account, 
and the benefits reaped. In the absence of any plausible explanation 
there is no alternative but to hold that the payment through US 
dollars formed part of the consideration of the agreement.  
14. 
The above discussion on the second point of determination 
leads this Court to opine as to what is the effect if the agreement 
stood proved, however, the factum of payment of part of the balance 
sale consideration as claimed by the respondents could not be 
substantiated. In this regard, this Court is to keep insight the settled 
legal position that the jurisdiction of the Courts to issue a decree of 
specific performance is discretionary/equitable in nature and in terms 
of Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (“the Act”), which 
facilitates and provides statutory classification of the instances where 
exercise of discretion by the Court(s) was limited and cases where 
such discretion could be liberally exercised. Paragraph III of section 
22 of the Act reads as under:  
“22.  
Discretion 
as 
to 
decreeing 
specific 
performance.–The jurisdiction to decree specific 
performance is discretionary, and the Court is not 
bound to grant such relief merely because it is lawful 
to do so; but the discretion of the Court is not 
arbitrary but sound and reasonable, guided by 
judicial principles and capable of correction by a 
Court of appeal. 

RFA No.267/2019  
13
I. 
….. 
II. 
….. 
III. 
Where the plaintiff has done substantial acts 
or suffered losses in consequence of a contract 
capable of specific performance.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
In view of the narrative above, we opine that execution of the 
agreement stood proved, where part of the consideration, in shape of 
earnest money and US dollars, constitute substantial performance, 
hence, it is just and equitable to exercise discretion for ordering 
specific performance of the agreement as equity mandates that in a 
suit for specific performance, it is the duty of the Court to find out, 
which party has not performed and is trying to wriggle out of his 
contractual obligations. In exercise of such discretion, the Court may 
consider the conduct of the parties which becomes relevant in 
granting and/or refusing decree for specific performance being 
discretionary and based on principles of equity. In cases involving 
specific performance, the primary part of the contract is the 
consideration to be paid by the vendee for which he must exhibit his 
willingness and readiness, at all times. In present case, admittedly, 
the cut-off date for payment of the balance sale consideration was set 
as 03.02.2015. The respondents took the stance that they were always 
ready and willing to perform their part of agreement and get the sale 
deed executed in their favour on payment of remaining sale 
consideration and deposited the amount when the decree was passed 
in their favour. It has not been pleaded before us that the respondents 
were not willing and ready to pay the balance sale consideration. 
Even when this Court indicated that the receipts of part of the 
balance consideration could not persuade us, the respondents have 
shown their willingness to pay the said amount as oppose to the 
appellant side which remained adamant that the agreement was never 
executed. Moreover, a huge amount has admittedly been paid to the 
appellant (US$ 42,000/- and earnest money amounting to 
Rs.5,000,000/-), which the appellant is utilizing since long. 

RFA No.267/2019  
14
15. 
For what has been discussed above, we hold that the Trial 
Court was justified in decreeing the suit of the respondents for 
specific performance of the agreement, however, the impugned 
judgment and decree is modified in the terms that the respondents are 
directed to deposit the amount of Rs.45,500,000/- (aggregate of the 
amount recorded in Exh.D2, Exh.D3 and Exh.D4) within two months 
from today with the Executing Court. Office to draw the decree sheet 
accordingly.  
16. 
Insofar as the connected appeal is concerned, the same is 
disposed of with the observation that the impugned decree shall
