Mian Tariq Ahmad, Advocate for petitioners. 
  
Through the instant revision petition judgments and 
decree dated 13.4.2022 and 04.3.2023 of the courts below 
have been called into question whereby the suit of the 
petitioners was dismissed by the trial court and appeal 
thereagainst was also dismissed. 
2. 
Petitioner No.1 and predecessors-in-interest of 
petitioner Nos. 2 to 9 and 10 to 15 instituted a suit for 
declaration against the respondents alleging that the 
predecessor-in-interest of the respondents, namely, Sadiq 
son of Saee had executed a sale agreement dated 
15.7.2002 in their favour with respect to suit property 
measuring 31 acres, 7 kanals and 16 marlas in khewat 
No.201/190 situated at Estate Qazian, Tehsil and District 
Chiniot for consideration of Rs.7,10,000/- out of which 
Rs.6,60,000/- was received at the time of execution of the 
agreement and that it was stipulated that the remaining 
sale consideration of Rs.50,000/- shall be paid at the time 
of attestation of mutation or execution of registered sale 
deed. Case built up was that the predecessor-in-interest of 
the respondents during his lifetime had transferred 
possession to them and neither denied the agreement nor 
refused to perform under it but kept on postponing to 
receive the balance sale consideration of Rs.50,000/- from 
them or executing the sale deed in their favour until his 
death and that after his death when the legal heirs were 

C.R. No.20075 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-2- 
 
 
approached they initially did not refuse to perform the 
agreement either but thereafter they declined to do so and 
mutation of inheritance was entered in their name and that 
in such circumstances the said vendees were compelled to 
file the suit. Declaration was claimed from the court to the 
effect that the petitioners were owners-in-possession of the 
suit property under the agreement dated 15.7.2002 and 
decree was liable to be accordingly passed in their favour 
and against the respondents or in the alternate a decree for 
specific enforcement of contract dated 15.7.2002 may be 
passed by the court and further that the respondents may 
be permanently restrained from forcibly dispossessing 
them or alienating the suit property to any third party. In 
their written statement the respondents denied the 
existence of the agreement which was claimed to be a 
product of fraud, forgery and fabrication. Issues were 
framed, evidence was led by both sides whereafter the suit 
of the petitioners was dismissed by the learned Civil Judge 
vide judgment dated 13.4.2022. The petitioners filed an 
appeal thereagainst which too was dismissed vide 
judgment dated 04.3.2023 by the learned Addl. District 
Judge, Chiniot. Through the instant revision petition these 
decisions of the courts below have been called into 
question. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners inter alia 
contended that the findings of the courts below were 
untenable, that suit was within time from the date of actual 
refusal to perform the contract, that execution of the 
agreement was proved and that evidence was not properly 
considered and construed. 
4. 
Submissions made in support of the instant petition 
have been given due consideration in the light of the oral 
and documentary evidence on record as also the reasoning 

C.R. No.20075 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-3- 
 
 
as prevailed upon the courts below for dismissing the suit 
and also the appeal of the petitioners. Perusal of the 
available documents shows that the suit for declaration or 
in the alternative for possession through specific 
performance was instituted on 30.7.2008 to enforce an 
agreement dated 15.7.2002. In terms of the purported sale 
agreement, plea taken in the suit was that the respondents’ 
predecessor-in-interest agreed to sell the suit land in 
consideration of Rs. 7,10,000/- and allegedly received 
earnest money of Rs. 6,60,000/- and that the possession 
was also transferred to petitioner No.1 and the 
predecessors of the rest of the petitioners who were 
alleged intending buyers. Execution of sale agreement was 
denied by the respondents who took the stance that no 
such transaction was ever entered into nor any payment 
was ever remitted by late Sadiq, their predecessor, nor the 
possession of land was transferred and that the suit was 
otherwise barred by time having been filed after more than 
six years from the date for completion of sale under 
alleged agreement. Main reason which prevailed with the 
courts below was that a specific date for the completion of 
the deal was mentioned in the disputed agreement; 
therefore, the suit would fall in the first part of Article 113 
of Limitation Act, 1908 which provides a period of three 
years from the date mentioned in the agreement for the  
completion of the transaction and that in terms of the 
document Exh.P-1 claimed by the petitioner, the 
transaction was to conclude by 15.10.2002 while the suit 
was filed on 30.7.2008 after six years and as such it was 
barred by time.    
5. 
Perusal of the alleged agreement dated 15.7.2002 
Exh.P-1 reveals that in terms thereof, the vendor had 
allegedly agreed to receive the balance sale consideration 

C.R. No.20075 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-4- 
 
 
and transfer the suit land in favour of the petitioners’ 
predecessor through sale deed or mutation till 15.10.2002 
and in case the vendor fails to complete the transaction by 
the stipulated date, the purported  vendee will be entitled 
to enforce the same through suit for specific performance 
and that in the event the purchaser failed to get the land 
transferred, the earnest money will stand forfeited. Perusal 
of the document provides in clear terms the cut-off date for 
the completion of transaction as 15.10.2002. Time was 
essence of the contract as the document indicates that the 
default would result in forfeiture of earnest money as per 
Exh.P-1, the transfer was to take effect either through 
attestation of mutation or sale deed on payment of balance 
consideration.  
6. 
The provision of Article 113 of the Limitation Act, 
1908 mandates that in the cases where date is fixed for the 
performance of the contract in the agreement itself then 
three years period will commence from the date so 
mentioned therein and if no such date is fixed then from 
the date the buyer had noticed that the performance was 
refused. There was no issue of title, the seller was 
considered to be owner of the property and competent to 
sell the same and as per terms the transaction was to be 
completed through mutation or sale deed till 15.10.2002. 
Being so  the case would fall in the first part of Article 113 
of the Limitation Act, 1908 in terms thereof suit could be 
filed till 14.10.2005 which was filed on 30.7.2008. The 
arguments that the case would fall in the second part of the 
Article is devoid of any legal reason. 
7. 
As observed supra, the terms of the alleged 
agreement Exh.P-1 clearly provides for the performance of 
the contract till 15.10.2002 and any breach thereof, could 
entail the consequences of either recission of contract, 

C.R. No.20075 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-5- 
 
 
forfeiture of the money or in the alternative, in the event of 
default on vendor’s part a right to seek  specific 
performance to enforce the agreement before the court of 
law. Provision on the face of it being specific and provided 
for time limit and cut-off date for the completion of the 
deal, the plea of the petitioner that their case would fall in 
second category of the cases covered by Article 113 of the 
Limitation Act, 1908 is devoid of substance. Petitioner’s 
plea that the possession of the property was delivered in 
pursuance of the agreement and as such section 53-A of 
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 was attracted, is untenable 
in view of the evidence on record. While considering the 
plea of delivery of possession under the sale agreement, it 
was observed by the court of first instance that the 
petitioner produced khasra girdawari Exh.P-6 since 2009 
wherein their names were mentioned as tenants and not as 
owners and that the khasra girdawari from July 2002 till 
2009 were not produced which was material in this regard 
and was relevant to verify if transfer of possession had 
ever taken place under any alleged agreement to sell on 
15.7.2002.  
8. 
In any case the petitioner was not mentioned in the 
column of possession in khasra girdawari for the year 
2009-10  Exh.P-6 as in possession under the sale rather 
they were described as tenants which obviously belies the 
stance of the petitioners as to the alleged delivery of 
possession under the sale agreement. In the course of 
hearing learned counsel could not point out any 
misreading in the entries of revenue record nor could show 
from the record any entry of possession “under the sale” 
i.e. “ba-tasawar baee”. The petitioner was  also required to 
produce khasra girdawari from 15.10.2002 till 2008 to 
support his plea that the possession under sale was 

C.R. No.20075 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-6- 
 
 
transferred but no such document was produced which 
obviously raised adverse inference against the petitioner. 
The courts below, therefore, rightly observed that the 
petitioner had failed to prove not only the agreement of 
sale but also transfer of possession under any alleged 
agreement and that the suit could be filed within three 
years from the date mentioned in the disputed agreement 
to sell which having not been filed, it was hopelessly 
barred by time. Learned counsel’s reliance on the case of 
“Syed Hakeem Shah (deceased) through L.Rs.  and others 
v. Muhammad Idrees and others” (2017 SCMR 316) is 
not helpful in supporting the petitioner’s plea inasmuch as 
in the said case it was observed that where the sale 
consideration was totally paid, possession was delivered to 
transferee and only on account of ban on the registration of 
lease their transfer document was not executed the 
transferee was well within his right to seek execution of 
sub-lease in his favour when the ban got lifted.  
9. 
The rule in this case does not apply to the 
petitioner’s suit as there was no ban on transfer of land in 
the case of the petitioner nor was there any legal or factual 
impediment in the transfer of the property by the 
predecessor of the respondents. As per petitioner’s own 
evidence the alleged vendor remained alive for six years 
who allegedly entered the agreement with full title, the 
only thing which was to be done was to transfer the 
ownership right by mutation or sale deed on receiving 
balance sale consideration till 15.10.2002. This being so, 
the suit ought to have been filed within three years from 
the date claimed in Exh.P-1 for the completion of 
transaction as there was no such restriction to the 
alienation of the property. In “Syed Athar Hussain Shah v. 
Haji Muhammad Riaz and another” (2022 SCMR 778) it 

C.R. No.20075 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-7- 
 
 
was observed to the effect that suit for specific 
performance of an agreement could be filed within three 
years as provided by Article 113 of the Limitation Act, 
1908 and that the alleged agreement of sale even if proved 
could not give any title in favour of the intending buyer as 
under:  
“11… 
The first suit had sought the specific performance 
of the agreement and the second suit also the cancellation 
of the sale deed. For both these causes of action the 
prescribed period of limitation is three years as respectively 
provided under Article 113 and Article 91 of the First 
Schedule of the Limitation Act, 1908. The petitioner’s third 
suit had sought the specific performance of the agreement, 
the cancellation of the sale deed, which was executed 
when there was no suit pending, and a declaration with 
regard to the ownership of the land. The third suit was filed 
after three years and was time barred with regard to 
seeking the specific performance of the agreement and for 
the cancellation of the sale deed. We are now left to 
consider whether the third suit was saved because it had 
also sought a declaration of ownership of the land as 
submitted by the petitioner’s learned counsel for which 
Article 120 prescribes six years period of limitation… An 
examination of the petitioner’s plaint makes it clear that the 
petitioner had primarily sought the specific performance of 
the agreement, then the cancellation of the sale deed and 
had added the declaratory relief to primarily save the third 
suit from the consequence of having been filed, beyond the 
period of limitation. 
12. 
The petitioner’s reliance on section 53-A of the 
Transfer of Property Act would also not save him from the 
vicissitude of the period of limitation. Section 53-A does not 
confer or creates a right, and its use is defensive as has 
been continuously held by this Court … The  linking or 
combining of section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act 
with the petitioner’s suit will not benefit him by extending 
the period of limitation and save the third suit.” 
It may be observed from the rule supra that petitioners’ 
reliance on the provisions of section 53-A of Transfer of 
Property Act, 1882 would not render any assistance for 
enlarging the period of limitation so as to allow the 
petitioner to file the suit after the alleged refusal. The facts 

C.R. No.20075 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-8- 
 
 
of the petitioners’ case are clearly distinguishable  as in the 
petitioners’ case, they could not prove transfer of 
possession under the sale and entries in the revenue record 
reflect their status as tenant and not as intending buyer 
and, being so, the provisions of section 53-A, Transfer Of 
Property Act, 1882 would otherwise not lend any support  
for helping hand to the petitioner to save them from the 
rigour of limitation. The findings of courts below on the 
question of limitation could not be shown to be either 
perverse or based on any misreading of the evidence nor 
any ground could be made out for interference therein. 
Suit being barred by time was liable to be dismissed and 
was rightly dismissed as such. 
10. 
Another important aspect of the matter is that in the 
instant case the execution of Exh.P-1 and existence of any 
intending sale transaction was disputed by the respondents 
who had categorically stated that neither any agreement 
was made nor any payment was received nor the 
possession was ever transferred in favour of the petitioner. 
The findings recorded by the court of first instance were 
that the pleadings of the petitioner did not show any 
negotiation of oral sale  if made prior to the written 
agreement to sell dated 15.7.2002 Exh.P-1 but all the PWs 
attempted  to take different  stands by claiming different 
dates of negotiation of sale prior to the sale agreement. 
The oral assertion being not founded in the pleadings, the 
evidence in this regard was rightly overlooked. It is also 
observed that from the evidence it was discernible that the 
deceased Sadiq predecessor of the respondents was 90 
years old when he died. The agreement Exh.P-1 was not 
claimed to have been made or executed  in the presence of 
any of the male member of the family though he was 
stated to have an elder son. It is also observed that from 

C.R. No.20075 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-9- 
 
 
15.7.2002 till the filing of the suit on 30.7.2008 the 
petitioner did not claim to have ever issued notice to the 
deceased Sadiq though he remained alive for six years. It 
is in the evidence that Sadiq died on 20.7.2008 i.e., after  
more than seven years from the date of alleged sale 
agreement dated 15.7.2002 but no evidence was produced 
to show that any notice whatsoever was given to him for 
transfer of property nor any suit was filed despite the 
expiry of limitation. The inaction on the part of the 
petitioner was quite conspicuous and raised serious 
suspicious as to the execution of document. The entire oral 
evidence was minutely scrutinized by the courts below 
whereafter the findings were recorded to the effect that 
execution of Exh.P-1 could not be proved nor any payment 
of alleged earnest money through Exh.P-2 could be 
established . No misreading or non-reading of any material 
part of evidence could be referred or shown in the course 
of hearing nor any error of law could be pointed out so as 
to warrant interference.  
11. 
 An argument was raised by the learned counsel 
that the appellate court could have exercised the powers 
under Order XLI, Rule 27, C.P.C. to seek additional 
evidence by way of referring the matter to expert for 
forensic examination and report as to the genuineness  of 
thumb-impression of Sadiq and that in not doing so an 
error of law was committed. The argument is 
misconceived. It is discernible from the file that the suit 
was instituted on 30.7.2008, it was dismissed on  
13.4.2022 during this period no application was filed for 
any comparison of thumb impression through the expert 
on the part of the petitioner. Under Rule 27 of Order XLI, 
C.P.C. the appellate court had jurisdiction to consider the 
permission for additional evidence provided the evidence 

C.R. No.20075 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-10- 
 
 
was refused by the court below illegally or the appellate 
court while considering the evidence on record  reaches 
the conclusion that additional evidence is necessary for the 
correct determination of the case or that  the existing 
evidence is not sufficient to reach the conclusion one way 
or the other. None of these circumstances existed as the 
petitioner had never applied for additional evidence before 
the trial court nor it was a case of refusal to grant 
permission of additional evidence; nor the court ever 
observed that the evidence was not sufficient to decide the 
case rather the circumstances noted in the reasoning of the 
court of first instance shows beyond doubt that  number of 
reasons were given to disbelieve the plea of the petitioner 
as to the  execution of document. Even otherwise the 
evidence on record was sufficient to conclude that the 
petitioner had failed to prove the existence of sale 
transaction with the deceased Muhammad Sadiq nor the 
agreement could prove the purported agreement by any 
credible evidence. No misreading or non-reading of 
evidence could be shown in the findings of the trial court 
and as such same were  rightly not interfered with in  
appeal by the learned Addl. District Judge.  
12. 
As to the argument that issue-wise findings were 
not recorded, the same is also untenable. Order XX, Rule 
5, C.P.C. applies to the suit and to the judgment of the trial 
court, the trial court decided the case issue-wise and 
recorded independent findings for rendering decision on 
all the issues. In appeal under Rule 31 of Order XLI, 
C.P.C. the court was required to consider the points raised 
in appeal at the time of hearing, the reasons recorded by 
the trial court and to decide the same by recording the 
reasons thereof. Appellate court is not required to decide 
the appeal by recording issue-wise findings but only the 

C.R. No.20075 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
-11- 
 
 
points raised at the time of hearing were to be looked into. 
Reference can be made to the case of “Kareem Bux v. P.O. 
Sindh and others” (1998 CLC 27). In the instant case the 
learned Addl. District Judge took note of the entire 
evidence, the reasoning recorded by the court below and 
after considering the same on the touchstone of law 
recorded findings to the effect that the suit was barred by 
time; which as also findings of the court on other points 
did not suffer from any misreading of record nor any error 
of law could be pointed out as to warrant interference. For 
the reasons above there is no substance in this revision 
petition which is accordingly dismissed.
