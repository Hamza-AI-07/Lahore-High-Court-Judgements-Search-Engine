Mr. Muzamal Aslam Khan, Advocate for the Petitioner. 
 
Mr. Waqas Umer, AAG, with Murtaza A.S.I. 
 
Rao Nasir Ilyas, Advocate for respondent No.5. 
Through the instant petition, under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the 
legality and validity of the impugned order dated 12.12.2023 
passed by Judicial Magistrate Section-30, District Courts, 
Lahore, 
have 
been 
challenged, 
whereby 
the 
accused/respondent No.5 was discharged from the case for 
insufficient incriminating material regarding the accused's 
implication.  
2. 
Heard. Record perused.  
3. 
Bare facts and perusal of the impugned order show that 
the investigating officer, through the application, requested for 
further physical remand of respondent No. 5. The physical 
remand of respondent No.5 was asked for by the police as 
some document had to be recovered from him for completion 
of the investigation. The Judicial Magistrate Section-30, 
Lahore, while discharging the accused (respondent No. 5), 
turned down the request for further physical remand of the 
accused (respondent No. 5). The accused (respondent No. 5) 
was discharged on the following grounds:- 
“I.O through this application requested for further 
physical remand of the accused person. 
The record shows the accused as nominated in FIR 
for preparing a false and forged agreement to sell

belonging to the property of Naziran Bibi (late), 
the mother of complainant. Previously seven days 
physical remand was accorded for the completion 
of investigation and recovery of alleged document. 
Presently, the matter is sub-judice between the 
parties on civil side, where the alleged document is 
used for obtaining stay orders. The court is the 
competent forum to proceed u/s 195 Cr.P.C., if the 
document is found to be false and fictitious. A 
private person is barred by Sec.195 Cr.P.C. make 
any complaint in this regard. 
So far as facts are concerned, during the 
investigation conducted till so far no forgery is 
established on part of present accused. As per 
report by ADC (R) license in the name of 
Muhammad Sharif (Stamp Vendor) is found to be 
valid from 1974 to 23.01.2015 (when cancelled). 
However, Stamp vending register for 2013-14 was 
not deposited by said Stamp Vendor but it could 
not be termed that stamp papers issued during this 
period are fake and fictitiousl. Nothing is 
recovered from the possession of present accused 
despite of 07 days physical remand. In such 
circumstances, I do not found any incriminating 
material on record and turn down the request of 
I.O for physical remand. The accused is discharged 
from this case FIR and be released, if not required 
in any other case.” 
Coming to the contention of the learned counsel for 
respondent No. 5 that an effort should be made to avoid 
conflict of findings between the civil and criminal courts, it is 
necessary to point out that the standard of proof required in the 
two proceedings is entirely different. Civil cases are decided 
based on preponderance of evidence, while in a criminal case, 
the entire burden lies on the prosecution, and proof beyond 
reasonable doubt has to be given. There is neither any 
statutory provision nor any legal principle that the findings 
recorded in one proceeding may be treated as final or binding 
in the other, as both cases have to be decided based on the

evidence adduced therein. Section 195 CrPC would be 
attracted only when the offenses enumerated in the said 
provision have been committed concerning a document after it 
has been produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any 
court. The existence of the document is not denied. The 
learned counsel for respondent No. 5 admitted that the 
document had not been produced or given in evidence. 
Findings of the Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Lahore, are 
perverse and against the law. The findings of the Judicial 
Magistrate Section-30, Lahore, are perverse and result from 
misreading and non-reading the oral and documentary 
evidence on the record and file. The order dated 12.12.2023 
passed by the Judicial Magistrate Section-30, Lahore, is set 
aside. The matter is referred to the learned District and 
Sessions Judge, Lahore, to entrust the case to any other 
Judicial Magistrate Section-30 to decide the matter afresh after 
issuing notice to all the concerned parties and allowing them 
to be heard by the law. 
4. 
With the above observations, the instant petition stands 
disposed of.
