Syed Hashim Raza Shamsi, learned counsel for the 
revision-petitioner.   
Mr. Muhammad Salman Asif Warraich, learned Assistant 
Advocate General.  
 
 
     
Through this single order, the captioned civil 
revision as well as civil revision No. 25021 of 2023 shall 
be decided.  
2.  
On 02.09.2003 the revision-petitioner filed 
suit titled “Zulfiqar Ali Versus Mirza Altaf Hussain and 
another” (the „suit‟) for specific performance of 
agreement dated 23.07.2003 (the „agreement‟) allegedly 
executed in his favour by respondent No. 1, permanent 
injunction and cancellation of sale deed dated 13.06.2009 
(the „sale deed‟) in favour of respondent No. 3 with 
respect to property as detailed in the suit (the „suit 
property‟). The suit was contested by the parties and the 
learned trial Court framed the relevant issues, which was 
followed by the process of producing evidence by the 
parties. On 22.09.2020 learned trial Court decreed the suit 
in favour of the revision-petitioner directing the District 
Collector, Chiniot to cancel the sale deed in favour of

respondent No. 3 with certain other observations. Being 
dissatisfied from this decision, the revision-petitioner and 
respondent No. 3 filed civil appeals No. PB-CHT-CA 43 
and PB-CHT-CA 46 of 2020. The learned Appellate 
Court while setting aside judgment and decree dated 
22.09.2020 of the learned trial Court reached to the 
conclusion that respondent No. 3 is prior purchaser of the 
suit property, therefore, the sale deed cannot be cancelled, 
however, the revision-petitioner was granted relief in 
terms of section 65 of the Contract Act-1872 vide 
judgment and decree dated 29.10.2021. Being aggrieved 
from the same, present civil revisions have been filed.  
3.  
It is observed that the civil revisions were 
instituted on 09.02.2022 when they were allocated diary 
Nos. 18258 of 2022 and 18240 of 2022. The concerned 
branch of the office raised several objections including the 
objection of incomplete file and failure of the revision-
petitioner to append the required court fee with civil 
revision No. 25021 of 2023. The revision-petitioner was 
given time of three days to remove the objections. The 
revision-petitioner received the files from the office on 
18.02.2022 and then re-filed the civil revisions on 
12.04.2023. The gap between the judgment and decree of

the learned Appellate Court and re-filing the civil 
revisions is five hundred and thirty (530) days.  
4.  
The learned counsel for the revision-
petitioner remained adamant in course of his arguments 
that the civil revisions are filed within ninety days. He 
stated that after excluding the time period consumed in 
preparing certified copy on 88th day the civil revisions 
were instituted, therefore, the question of limitation does 
not arise. The controversy, if the limitation stops running 
when application or appeal is filed within time and then 
returned for removing objections to re-file the same 
within given time frame and then the litigant fails to file 
the same within the given time period, was resolved by 
the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled 
“Asad Ali and 9 Others Versus The Bank of Punjab and 
Others” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 736), wherein, it has 
been held that in the cases in which certain objections are 
raised by the office which rendered the institution of case 
in itself invalid or incompetent should be held to be time 
barred unless the objections or deficiencies indicated by 
the office are met within the time specified by the office. 
Paragraphs No. 15 and 16 of the aforesaid judgment reads 
as under:- 
  
“15. The said principle of law has 
repeatedly been laid down, followed, approved, 
affirmed and reiterated in a large number of 

 
 
 
 
 
Civil Revision Nos. 25008 and 25021 of 2023

judgments of this Court as well as the High Courts. 
Starting from the judgment of the Lahore High Court 
Lahore reported as Ghulam Hussain v. Bahadar 
(PLD 1954 Lahore 361) till judgment of this Court 
reported as Lahore Development Authority v. 
Muhammad Rashid (1997 SCMR 1224), there is 
consistency in the principle that if objections raised 
by the office are not removed during the period 
allowed by the office and meanwhile the limitation 
period expires, the petition would become barred by 
time. There are two subsequent judgments of this 
Court reported as Mst. Sabiran Bi v. Ahmad Khan 
(2000 SCMR 847) and Farman Ali v. Muhammad 
Ishaq (PLD 2013 SC 392) which are incorrectly 
understood to have decided that so long as the initial 
institution is within the limitation period, removal of 
objections raised by the office after expiry of the 
limitation period does not render the petition to be 
barred by time. The said judgments have been 
rendered 
in 
a 
different 
set 
of 
facts 
and 
circumstances, do not lay down the entire law on the 
subject and are distinguishable on points of law as 
well as facts. 
  
16. Be that as it may, since the LDA case 
(ibid) was decided by three learned Judges, it has to 
be followed instead of the two subsequent judgments 
rendered by two learned Judges. In addition to the 
above, following judgments also hold that if 
objections raised by the office are not removed 
within the time specified by the office and in the 
meanwhile  limitation for filing the appeal expires, 
the appeal would be rendered time-barred: 
Lahore 
Development 
Authority 
v. 
Muhammad Rashid (1997 SCMR 1224); 
Naheed Ahmad v. Asif Riaz (PLD 1996 
Lahore 702); Ghulam Hussain v. Bahadar 
(PLD 1954 Lahore 361); Ellahi Bakhsh and 
8 others v. Ahmad Bakhsh and 2 others (1999 
YLR 777); Ghulam Dastgir Khan Lak v. 
Hayat (2000 CLC 781); Muhammad Idrees v. 
Abdul Rehman (2001 YLR 2294); Mazhar 
Iqbal v. Muhammad (2001 YLR 819); Protein 
and Fats International (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Capital 
Assets Leasing Corporation Limited (2005 
CLD 857); and Controller Land Acquisition 
v. Fazal-ur-Rehman (2009 SCMR 767).  
  
The above judgment was then relied by this 
Court in cases titled “Saleem Khan Versus Mst. Zeenat 
and Others” (2023 CLC 1217) and “Province of Punjab 

 
 
 
 
 
Civil Revision Nos. 25008 and 25021 of 2023

and Others Versus Muhammad Arif and Company” (PLD 
2022 Lahore 596). 
6.  
At the bottom of objection-sheets, received 
by the revision-petitioner on 18.02.2022, it is clearly 
stipulated that the objections are to be removed within 
three (3) days,  however, the revision-petitioner despite 
receiving the files remained unable to return the same 
after removing the objections within the given time 
period.  
7.  
When the learned counsel for the revision-
petitioner was confronted with the above position, he 
stated that another learned advocate dealing with the case, 
in the process of shifting his office, misplaced the files 
and as a result of the same he could not re-file the same 
within the specified time. The civil revisions are 
accompanied with applications (C. M. No. 02 of 2023 in 
titled civil revision and C. M. No. 02 of 2023 in civil 
revision No. 25021 of 2023) for condonation of delay. 
Paragraph No. 3 of the said application(s) reads as 
follows:- 
 
“3.  
That after receiving the case file the 
undersigned Counsel shift his office and due 
to this reason the case file was misplace and 
the case could not be re-filed within specific 
time.” 

 
 
 
 
 
Civil Revision Nos. 25008 and 25021 of 2023

The applications are signed by the present 
learned counsel (Syed Hashim Raza Shamsi). The 
applications are also accompanied by his affidavits. It is 
stated in the reproduced paragraph that the undersigned 
counsel (Syed Hashim Raza Shamsi) was shifting his 
office, whereas, today the learned advocate has argued 
totally contrary to the above ground and attempted to 
attribute the delay to some fellow learned advocate. In the 
entire application(s) no date of shifting the office or when 
the files were traced is given. The stance adopted by the 
learned counsel for the revision-petitioner has no leg to 
stand on. In “Lahore Development Authority v. 
Muhammad Rashid” (1997 SCMR 1224) the similar 
ground regarding change of office was taken, which was 
repelled for the reason that it is too implausible and 
unbelievable that the file could not be located for about a 
year as well as the affidavit attached was silent as to 
material aspects. In the present case, the delay in re-filing 
the civil revisions is about fourteen months. Mr. 
Muhammad Salman Asif Warraich, learned law officer, 
also has correctly referred to the case titled “Province of 
Punjab through District Officer Revenue, Rawalpindi and 
others versus Muhammad Sarwar” (2014 SCMR 1358) 
and stated that party aggrieved from an order or judgment 
of a subordinate Court is required to invoke the revisional 

 
 
 
 
 
Civil Revision Nos. 25008 and 25021 of 2023

jurisdiction within the time period given in second proviso 
of section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure-1908, 
which unambiguously stipulates that “provided that such 
application shall be made within ninety days of the 
decision of the subordinate Court” and after failing to 
invoke this jurisdiction within the aforesaid time period 
the litigant cannot be permitted to rely upon the 
supervisory powers and discretion of this Court.  
8.  
In order to satisfy and to avoid any 
possibility of miscarriage of justice, I have gone through 
the entire available documents as well as the judgments of 
the learned two Courts below. The learned Appellate 
Court has refused to grant specific performance or to 
cancel the sale deed in favour of respondent No. 3 for the 
reason that the agreement dated 15.03.2001 (Exh. D6) in 
his favour is prior to the one in favour of Zulfiqar Ali / the 
revision-petitioner. The sale deed (Mark-DC) in favour of 
respondent No. 3 was admittedly registered with Sub-
Registrar-Bhowana on 13.06.2009. The record does not 
reflect any denial on the part of Mirza Altaf / the seller 
vis-à-vis agreement (Exh. D6) and the sale deed.  I have 
also asked the learned counsel for the revision-petitioner 
to show it from the record if Mirza Altaf / the seller has

ever denied Exh. D6, however, he failed to give any 
convincing answer.  
9.  
For what has been discussed above, the 
miscellaneous applications to condone the delay are 
dismissed and as a consequence of the same, titled civil 
revision along-with civil revision No. 25021 of 2023 are 
also dismissed in limine. No order as to costs.
