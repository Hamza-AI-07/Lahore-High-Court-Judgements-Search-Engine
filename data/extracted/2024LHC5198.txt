Relief.   
Respondent, in oral evidence, himself appeared in the witness box 
as PW-1 and examined Ansar Atta Ullah as PW-2 and Adnan Dar, 
Advocate as PW-3. In documentary evidence, respondent produced 
pronote and its receipt as Exh.P1 & Exh.P2, respectively. On the 
other hand, appellant himself appeared as DW-1 and closed his 
evidence. Learned Trial Court, after recording evidence and 
hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties, proceeded to 
decree the suit as prayed for vide judgment & decree dated 
16.12.2022. Hence, this appeal.  
3. 
Learned counsel for appellant submits that only one attesting 
witness, namely Adnan Dar, Advocate (PW-3) was produced by 
the respondent, in whose presence the alleged pronote (Exh.P1) 
was executed and allegedly received by the respondent vide receipt 
(Exh.P2). He adds that even the said attesting witness has denied 
payment of any loan in his presence. He maintains that there are 
material contradictions in the statements of PWs. He argues that 
respondent’s objection upon deficiency of stamp duty has not been 
dealt with in accordance with law while passing impugned 
judgment & decree, which is unsustainable in the eye of law.  
4. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent defends 
impugned judgment & decree and submits that appellant has failed 
to point out any illegality or legal infirmity in the impugned 
judgment, which is liable to be upheld under the law. He states that 
appellant had the choice to produce a Handwriting Expert when he 
disputed his signature upon the pronote, but he opted not to 
produce any such expert. In support of his stance, learned counsel 
for respondent has referred to Sheikh Muhammad Shakeel v. Sheikh 
Hafiz Muhammad Aslam (2014 SCMR 1562), Abdul Rasheed v.

Syed Fazal Ali Shah (2016 SCMR 2163), Najaf Iqbal v. Shahzad 
Rafique (2020 SCMR 1621), Sardar Ali Muhammad v. 
Muhammad Ayyub (2015 YLR 1649), Aziz Ahmad v. Akbar 
Shamsher (PLD 2016 Lahore 502) and Muhammad Nawaz v. Qazi 
Muhammad Rashid [2018 CLC Note 34].  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
6. 
In application for leave to appear and defend the suit, 
appellant specifically denied execution of the pronote and receipt 
of payment / loan, therefore, initial burden was on the shoulders of 
respondent to prove payment of loan consideration, besides valid 
execution of pronote and receipt. Respondent (PW-1), in her 
examination-in-chief, stated that on 09.02.2016, appellant 
borrowed an amount of Rs.10,00,000/- from respondent and profit 
at the ratio of 5% per month was fixed and in this regard a pronote 
dated 09.02.2016 was executed in presence of witnesses, namely 
Adnan Dar and Ch. Ata Ullah and a receipt was also executed; that 
both these documents were attested by witnesses and appellant also 
affixed signatures & thumb impression on these documents; that 
the parties and the witnesses were present in his house where Ex.P-
1 & Ex.P-2 were reduced into writing and signed & thumb marked 
by all the concerned in the same meeting. Whereas Adnan Dar 
(PW-3), Advocate admitted, during cross-examination, that 
appellant did not sign the pronote in his presence; that loan was not 
paid in his presence; and that the other witness of promissory note, 
namely Atta Ullah did not come to house of plaintiff in his 
presence at the time when the promissory note was being written. 
For ease of reference, relevant part of the statement of PW-3 is 
reproduced hereunder:- 
“….. The defendant did not sign the promissory note in my 
presence. After writing of promissory note, I left the house of 
plaintiff within 15 minutes, thereafter, I did not visit the 
plaintiff again on that day. No payment of loan was made in 
my presence. The other witness of promissory note namely 
Atta Ullah did not come to house of plaintiff in my presence 
at the time when the promissory note was being written. …..”

7. 
Only one of the attesting witnesses i.e. PW-3 was produced, 
who has not supported the stance of respondent and his depositions 
are in contradiction to the statement of PW-1. The other attesting 
witness had died so could not be produced in evidence, however 
his son (PW-2) identified the signatures of his father on Ex.P-2. In 
these circumstances, evidence produced by respondent was not 
sufficient to hold that the disputed amount had been paid and 
pronote and receipt had been duly executed. The Courts below 
while passing the impugned decision has misinterpreted the 
evidence brought on record and erred in law, hence the same are 
unsustainable in the eye of law. Reference can be made to Gulzar 
Mehmood Khan v. Abdul Whaeed (2016 CLC 848) and Khawaja 
Aftab Ahmad v. Qazi Abdul Ali (2016 YLR 1552). 
8. 
There is another important aspect of the matter. Respondent 
was required under the law to establish that there was a 
relationship between the parties business or family ties which 
pondered him to lend such a handsome amount. The contents of 
the plaint are not reflecting such averment, however in cross-
examination as PW-1, respondent simply stated that appellant was 
his relative without further elaborating the nature of relation and 
family terms, if any, thus in absence of any explicit stance qua 
relationship, it is not understandable that how respondent gave 
such a considerable amount to appellant as loan, hence his claim 
was not sustainable on this score also. This view is supported by a 
recent verdict of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case 
reported as Mehr Noor Muhammad v. Nazir Ahmed (PLD 2024 
Supreme Court 45). 
9. 
Respondent produced pronote and receipt thereof in 
evidence, respectively, and an objection was raised by the 
adversary counsel qua insufficient stamp duty and learned Trial 
Court vowed to address the aforesaid objection at the time of final 
decision, however exhibited the documents. Learned counsel for 
appellant has pleaded that the aforesaid objection has not been 

5 
R.F.A. No.1829 of 2023 
 
appropriately addressed by learned Trial Court at the time of final 
decision, thus, the said documents could not have been given 
evidentiary value and impugned judgment and decree is not legally 
sustainable. The submission is totally misconceived firstly in view 
of Section 36 of the Stamp Act, 1899, which provides that once a 
document has been admitted in evidence, such admission cannot 
be called into question at any stage of the suit or in proceedings, 
on the ground that the instrument has not been duly stamped; 
and secondly it has been enunciated by the Hon’ble Apex Court in 
the case of Mehr Noor Muhammad supra that such objection has 
to be decided there and then when the document is tendered in 
evidence; once the Court, rightly or wrongly, admits the 
document in evidence and allows the parties to use it in 
examination and cross-examination, so far as the parties are 
concerned, the matter is closed; that the the party challenging the 
admissibility of the document must be alert to see that the 
document is not admitted in evidence by the Court. In the 
present case as the promissory note had been admitted in 
evidence, the same cannot be reviewed or revised by the same 
Court or a Court of superior jurisdiction. 
10. 
In view of the above, instant appeal is allowed and   
impugned judgment & decree dated 16.12.2022 is set aside. 
Consequently, respondent’s suit is dismissed.
