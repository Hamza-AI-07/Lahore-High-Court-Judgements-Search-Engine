Petitioner by 
Mr. Allah Nawaz Khosa, Advocate. 
Respondents by 
Ms. Baby Tabassum, Law Officer LG&CD 
Department. 
Mr. Omer Farooq Khan, Assistant Advocate-
General, 
Punjab 
alongwith 
Muhammad 
Saleem, M.O. (F), MC TT Sing. 
 
ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. Through this Constitutional 
Petition, the petitioner has challenged four impugned orders 
passed by respondents No.1 and 2 i.e. order dated 21.07.2017 
(wrongly mentioned as 27.07.2017 in the petition), whereby his 
representation for grant of pensionary benefits against the post of 
“Assistant Finance” (BS-16) was declined, order dated 19.08.2017, 
whereby his promotion as “Assistant” (BS-11) was withdrawn, 
Corrigendum dated 08.01.2020, whereby his retirement order dated 
14.04.2016 was modified mentioning the retirement against the 
post of “Senior Clerk” and the order dated 25.01.2020, whereby he 
was held eligible to get his pensionary benefits of “Senior Clerk”, 
and consequently seeking his pensionary benefits against the post 
of “Assistant Finance” (BS-16).  
2. 
Relevant facts are that the petitioner was appointed as 
“Clerk” (BS-5) in Municipal Committee (MC), Toba Tek Singh 

[-2-] 
Writ Petition No.66980/2017 
 
 
 
 
(TT Singh) on 06.06.1984 and finally he was retired on 30.09.2016 
as “Assistant Finance” (BS-16), however, his pension was not 
released and consequently, the impugned order dated 21.07.2017 
was passed by respondent No.1 to the effect that petitioner’s 
promotion as “Assistant” in BS-11, vide order dated 13.10.2005, 
was not valid under the relevant Rules, therefore, he will receive 
the pension against the post of “Senior Clerk” and not “Assistant 
Finance” (BS-16), however, while taking lenient view the salary 
already received by him as “Assistant Finance” (BS-16) was not to 
be recovered. Consequently, the impugned order dated 19.08.2017, 
Corrigendum dated 08.01.2020 and order dated 25.01.2020 were 
passed by respondent No.2, hence, this Constitutional Petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner 
being a retired employee of the Punjab Local Government and not a 
Civil Servant, this Constitutional Petition is maintainable. He 
submits that the petitioner was promoted from time to time and 
finally retired in BS-16, therefore, he is entitled for pensionary 
benefits of BS-16. He, in support of his arguments, placed reliance 
on “CDA THROUGH CHAIRMAN, ISLAMABAD and others Vs. 
SHABIR 
HUSSAIN 
and 
others” 
(2022 
SCMR 
627), 
“MUHAMMAD ISRAR, ASI and 138 others Vs. GOVT. OF 
KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA and others” (2017 PLC(CS) 1128) 
and “TANVEER HUSSAIN Vs. DIRECTOR, AGRICULTURE 

[-3-] 
Writ Petition No.66980/2017 
 
 
 
 
(ECONOMICS AND MARKETING), PUNJAB, LAHORE and 3 
others” (2012 PLC(CS) 948).  
4. 
Learned Law Officer, on the other hand, submits that the 
petitioner was appointed as “Clerk” (BS-5) in MC, TT Singh on 
06.06.1984 and later on promoted as “Senior Clerk” (BS-7) on 
04.02.1992. Submits that after promulgation of the Punjab Local 
Government Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance), Tehsil Municipal 
Administrations (TMAs) were established and District Councils 
were dissolved. Submits that the employees of defunct District 
Councils were adjusted in TMAs. Contends that the petitioner was 
promoted as “Assistant” (BS-11) on 13.10.2005 against the post of 
defunct District Council, whereas he was an employee of MC, TT 
Singh and not District Council, hence, the said promotion being not 
valid the subsequent upgradations of the petitioner are also nullity 
in the eyes of law.  
5. 
Arguments heard.  Record perused. There is no dispute that 
the petitioner was appointed as “Clerk” (BS-5) in MC, TT Singh on 
06.06.1984 and was promoted as “Senior Clerk” (BS-7) on 
04.02.1992 and served as “Perokar”. Subsequently, after 
promulgation of the Ordinance, TMAs were established and 
District Councils were dissolved and the petitioner was promoted 
against the post of “Assistant” (BS-11) on 13.10.2005 by the 
relevant authority and his post was twice upgraded to BS-14 on 

[-4-] 
Writ Petition No.66980/2017 
 
 
 
 
01.07.2007 and to BS-16 on 01.01.2016 and he stood retired as 
“Assistant Finance” (BS-16) on 14.04.2016 w.e.f. 30.09.2016. It is 
not the case of the respondents that petitioner’s promotion order 
dated 13.10.2005 was not passed by the competent Authority or he 
had no prescribed qualification or he lacked experience against the 
post of “Assistant” (BS-11) but the only ground, raised by the 
respondents to deny him pensionary benefits of BS-16, is that said 
post was relating to District Council whereas the petitioner was 
employee of MC, TT Singh. This defect in the promotion 
proceedings is not attributable to the petitioner rather at best it was 
a fault or irregularity on part of the Department. It is well settled 
that in absence of any fraud, misrepresentation or fault on part of 
the employee in promotion proceedings, he cannot be deprived of 
his right of pensionary benefits after lapse of considerable period.  
6. 
Some of the judgments and the law settled therein, on 
aforesaid proposition, are reproduced as under:- 
(I) 
The 
Supreme 
Court 
of 
Pakistan 
in 
“CAPITAL 
DEVELOPMENT 
AUTHORITY 
through 
Chairman, 
Islamabad and others Vs. SHABIR HUSSAIN and others” 
(2022 SCMR 627) held as under: 
“In the instant case, on the face of it, neither 
any fault or defect of respondents was pointed 
out by CDA nor any oversight or error on the 
part of DPC members or its composition or 
jurisdiction which could result an un-
ceremonious withdrawal of promotion order 
after considerable period. In these set of 
circumstances, the doctrine of vested right is 

[-5-] 
Writ Petition No.66980/2017 
 
 
 
 
quite applicable which conserves that once a 
right is lawfully created, its existence should 
be recognized and acknowledged, therefore, 
the benefit of promotions earned on DPC re-
commendations have become an undeniable 
and incontrovertible right of the respondents 
which could not be cancelled or withdrawn. 
.………………..The 
existing 
Rules 
or 
Regulation if amended and notified by CDA 
will obviously come into field prospectively 
and not retrospectively. No such ground or 
reason was assigned in the withdrawal/ 
cancellation 
order, 
albeit, 
the 
alleged 
intention or idea to amend the rules or 
regulation could not justify to undo or 
withdraw the promotion orders of the 
respondents 
under 
the 
garb 
of 
future 
amendments of rules/regulations which are 
non-est. Even the rules are amended, the CDA 
would not be able to upset or disturb the past 
and closed transaction. It is not the case of 
CDA that promotion was accorded to the 
respondents due to some misunderstanding, 
error, misconception of law or without 
sanction of competent authority, therefore, the 
principle of locus poenitentiae is also 
attracted to ameliorate and ventilate the 
sufferings of the respondents. 
 
(II) 
The law laid down in “Mian TARIQ JAVED Vs. 
PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through Chief Secretary, 
Government of Punjab, Lahore and 2 others” (2008 
SCMR 598) is as follows: 
“5-A. There is no cavil to the proposition 
that the appointment in departure to the 
rules is against the policy of law but 
notwithstanding the legal defect in the 
initial appointment, the principle of locus 
poenitentiae would not permit the competent 
authority to undo an appointment after such 
a long time on the ground that the 
appointment was in violation of rules and 
remove the incumbent from the office. The 
Tribunal without adhering to the principle 

[-6-] 
Writ Petition No.66980/2017 
 
 
 
 
of equality and equal treatment before the 
law as enshrined in Article 25 of the 
Constitution that the persons placed in 
similar situation in the alike circumstances, 
cannot be dealt with differently in departure 
to the rule of fairness and equal treatment, 
disposed of the appeal of the appellant with 
conversion of penalty of removal from 
service awarded to him into compulsory 
retirement. The Tribunal also did not attend 
the 
pivotal 
question 
regarding 
the 
retrospective application of the Ordinance 
to the transaction past and closed.” 
 
(III) In “PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through Secretary, 
Agriculture, Government of Punjab and others Vs. 
ZULFIQAR ALI” (2006 SCMR 678) it was held as under: 
“7. We are afraid that the contention so 
raised by him is not correct as the Director 
Agriculture appointed him on 10-11-1990 
and thereafter his service was regularized 
w.e.f. the same date in the year of 1993. He 
served the department for about 11 years 
as a regular employee and during course 
whereof, there was no complaint of 
whatsoever nature against him, calling for 
action under the Punjab Civil Servants 
(Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1975. It 
may be noted that these rules contemplate 
an action against an employee who is 
guilty for the breach of good service order, 
indiscipline, misconduct etc. but it does 
not, contain any provision on the basis of 
which appointment of an employee can be 
cancelled on the ground that it has been 
made illegally. In other words in such-like 
situation instead of taking action against 
an appointee it is appropriate if an action 
is taken against the Appointing Authority 
who apparently committed a misconduct by 
making such appointment, as it has been 
observed by this Court in the case of Abdul 
Hafeez Abbasi and others v. Managing 
Director, Pakistan International Airlines 

[-7-] 
Writ Petition No.66980/2017 
 
 
 
 
Corporation, Karachi and others 2002 
SCMR 1034.” 
 
(IV) This Court in “AMMAD AHMAD Versus NATIONAL 
HIGHWAY AUTHORITY through its Chairman and 5 
others ” (2018 PLC (C.S.) Note 187) held as follows: 
“14. There is nothing on record to show 
that respondents No.5 and 6 procured 
their appointments, regularization and 
promotion through fraud and illegal 
means. In this eventuality, when the 
appointees are not at fault, the appointing 
authority ought to have been proceeded 
against. It is settled law that party should 
not be made to suffer for action or 
inaction of the authority, who was obliged 
to follow the law. The Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, vide judgment dated 
11.06.2014, passed in C.P. No.51-L of 
2014 titled Ahsan Jabbar v. Government 
of Punjab, and others has held that if some 
fault was committed by the departmental 
authorities while assessing eligibility for 
appointment, the employee could not be 
deprived from his job due to faults of the 
department. 
At 
this 
belated 
stage, 
respondents No.5 and 6 cannot be 
penalized due to irregularities, if any, 
committed in the process of appointment 
and subsequent steps…………15. Under 
the law, decisive steps taken by the 
authority cannot be withdrawn. Law is 
well settled that once a right is created by 
extending benefit for no default of a 
person, the same cannot be taken away on 
mere assumption, supposition, whims and 
fancy. Such right, once vested, could not 
be destroyed or withdrawn as legal bar 
would come into play under the doctrine 
of locus poenitentiae. Even in presence of 
any legal defect in initial appointment, 
principle of locus poenitentiae would not 
permit competent authority to undo same 
after a long time and remove incumbent 

[-8-] 
Writ Petition No.66980/2017 
 
 
 
 
from service.” 
 
(V) 
In “MUHAMMAD ISRAR, ASI and 138 others Versus 
GOVERNMENT OF KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA and 
others” (2017 PLC (C.S.) 1128) held as follows: 
“17. Lastly learned AAG while relying on 
2013 
SCMR 
1752, 
contended 
that 
perpetual rights cannot be claimed on an 
illegal order, therefore, the authority 
cancelled the promotion orders of the 
petitioners and the same cannot be 
granted as of right. Indeed, perpetual 
rights cannot be claimed on an illegal 
order, but in the instant case, the order of 
promotion dated 24.07.2015 is quite legal 
and lawful, because the same has been 
issued 
with 
the 
approval 
by 
of 
Departmental Promotion Committee, by 
the Competent Authority and nowhere in 
the comments, so filed by the respondents 
and 
arguments 
at 
bar, 
they 
have 
contended that petitioners were neither fit 
nor eligible for promotion, rather it has 
been 
proved 
on 
record 
that 
the 
cancellation order is of no lawful 
authority and a void order. The principle 
of locus poenitentiae could be invoked by 
competent authority till the time the 
decisive stage was not reached. In the 
instant case it is established that the 
orders were conveyed and acted upon, the 
said orders were even published in the 
gazette part-II and petitioners have 
reported to their place of posting as well, 
then a valuable right have accrued to the 
petitioners and as such they cannot be 
deprived of vested right by the authority, 
in view of which this writ petition is 
allowed as prayed for. Petitioners are 
deemed to be promoted from the date of 
their promotion order dated 24.7.2015.” 
 
(VI) In 
“TANVEER 
HUSSAIN 
Vs. 
DIRECTOR, 
AGRICULTURE (ECONOMICS AND MARKETING), 

[-9-] 
Writ Petition No.66980/2017 
 
 
 
 
PUNJAB LAHORE and 3 others ” (2012 PLC (C.S.) 948) 
also held as follows: 
“14. Needless to mention that it was 
incumbent upon the Competent Authority 
to apply its conscious mind while 
scrutinizing the petitioner’s case and 
antecedents for promotion before issuing 
the promotion order in his favour. Once 
petitioner 
has 
been 
promoted 
after 
fulfilling all the codal formalities by the 
Competent Authority the same could not 
be questioned or reverted on the flimsy 
ground that the post of Auctioneer had to 
be filled in through initial recruitment 
under some Rules. Certainly a matter 
being past and closed transaction cannot 
be re-opened under the principle of locus 
poenitentiae. The impugned orders dated 
16-3-2011 and 28-6-2011, therefore, are 
neither based on principle of justice and 
equity nor tenable in law.” 
 
(VII) The law settled by this Court in “ASAD ALI ALVI Versus 
SECRETARY, 
GOVERNMENT 
OF 
PUNJAB, 
IRRIGATION AND POWER DEPARTMENT, LAHORE 
and 8 others” (2007 PLC (C.S.) 924) is as under: 
“5. It is admitted fact that the petitioner 
was 
awarded 
promotion 
on 
the 
recommendation of the DPC and he  
was appointed as officiating Circle 
Superintendent and on that post he worked 
and performed his duties honestly and if 
the proceedings of the DPC were defective 
or there was any irregularity committed by 
the Department, the petitioner could not 
be held responsible for the same. Recovery 
of amount paid on basis of incorrect order 
received by the petitioner on a bona fide 
belief that he was entitled to it, as such the 
respondents were not entitled to recover 
the amount from the petitioner during the 
period when incorrect order remained in 
field and principle of locus poenitentiae 

[-10-] 
Writ Petition No.66980/2017 
 
 
 
 
would be applicable to this case.” 
7. 
In crux, the law settled in aforesaid judgments is that when 
there are no allegations of fraud, misrepresentation or using of 
illegal means on part of the promotee and order is also passed by 
the Competent Authority then merely due to defect in the 
proceedings on part of the Department, the promotion order cannot 
be withdrawn at belated stage. In such situation, the promotion 
order is protected under the principles of “vested right”, “past & 
closed transaction” and “locus poenitentiae”. 
8. 
In view of above discussion, this Constitutional Petition is 
allowed and the impugned orders passed by respondents No.1 & 2, 
being illegal and without lawful authority, are set-aside. 
Consequently, the petitioner shall be extended his pensionary 
benefits against the post of “Assistant Finance” (BS-16) with effect 
from the date of his retirement i.e. 30.09.2016.
