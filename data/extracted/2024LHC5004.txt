 Petitioner seeks benefit of appointment under 
Rule 17-A of Punjab Civil Servants (Appointment & 
Conditions of Service) Rules 1974 (Rules, 1974), 
claims right to be considered for appointment, statedly 
accrued before the omission of Rule 17-A of the Rules, 
1974 vide Notification No. SOR-III(S&GAD)2-
60/2024 dated 26.07.2024. Pursuant to the order dated 
04.11.2024, 
relevant 
documents 
are 
provided, 
wherefrom it transpired that invalidation certificate of 
petitioner’s father was affirmed on 21st December 
2023. Notably, process for considering petitioner for 
the purposes of appointment under Rule 17-A of the 
Rules, 1974 had commenced before omission of Rule 
17-A ibid, took effect.  
  
 
  
Grievance alleged is that despite entitlement to be 
considered and fulfilling all conditions, grant of 10% 
marks had been denied by Punjab Public Service 
Commission (PPSC) upon giving retrospective effect 
to the omission of Rule 17-A of the Rules 1974. PPSC 
regretted petitioner’s request for grant of additional 
marks.

2. Question of law involved is whether PPSC’s 
interpretation of the omission of Rule 17-A of the 
Rules 1974 is lawful, which read and enforced it 
retrospectively. 
This 
Court 
already 
held 
that 
retrospective effect could not be extended to the 
Notification of the omission of Rule 17-A of the Rules 
1974, while deciding constitutional petition, vide order 
of 
14.10.2024, 
in 
the 
case 
bearing 
W.P. 
No.13444/2024 
titled 
“SYED 
NOOR-UL-HADI 
SHAH VS. GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB, etc”. 
 
3. Upon perusal of Rule 17-A of the Rules 1974, it 
appears that entitlement for grant of additional marks 
was provided therein, which was denied by giving 
retrospective effect to an omitted rule. Entitlement for 
additional marks is apparently available, subject to the 
conditions prescribed.   
 
4. Learned Law Officer opposed this petition, who 
read few paragraphs from recent decision of Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan of 26.09.2024 – which was 
announced in open Court on 18.10.2024 – passed in 
case bearing Civil Petition No.3390 of 2021, titled 
“General Post Office, Islamabad & others Vs. 
Muhammad Jalal”(2024 SCP 358), to emphasize that 
concession(s) extended in the nature of Rule 17-A 
appointments 
were 
declared 
discriminatory 
and 
respective governments were directed to withdraw all 
such policies / rules, etc. Decision is examined, which 
had not declared Rule 17-A of the Rules, 1974 void ab 
initio or invalid from inception – from the date it was 
introduced by the Government. Evidently, Government 
of Punjab had issued Notification of omission of Rule 
17-A of the Rules 1974 even before hearing of referred 
case on 26.09.2024, which was announced in open 

3 
W.P. No.12771 of 2024 
 
court on 18.10.2024. How could this court extend 
retrospective effect to the Notification of omission of 
Rule 17-A, when no such intention was evident from 
the Notification, whereby the delegatee / rule making 
authority had given prospective effect to such 
Notification. In these circumstances, element of 
retrospectivity could not be read into or extended to the 
Notification – such is not the scope and extent of 
judicial review jurisdiction, i.e., to read words in the 
Notification or to provide something, not intended to 
be there in the first place. There is no cavil that 
judgments, unless given retrospective effect qua 
enforceability, are prospective. No retrospectivity 
could be extended to the ratio settled in the case of 
General Post Office, Islamabad & others (supra). 
Effect of repeal in terms of section 4 of the Punjab 
General Clauses Act 1956 cannot be overlooked while 
attending to the grievance of the petitioner.       
 
5. In view of the above, it is reiterated that 
retrospective effect extended to the Rule 17-A of the 
Rules 1974 by PPSC constitutes misreading of the law, 
an error apparent, which erroneous interpretation is 
declared 
infective 
and 
of 
no 
legal 
effect. 
Simultaneously, 
the 
scope 
of 
judicial 
review 
jurisdiction is clear, which cannot be extended to 
embark upon determination of eligibility claimed by 
the petitioner, for the purposes of considering right to 
be considered for appointment under Rule 17-A of the 
Rules, 1974. This, undoubtedly, is the domain of the 
authority(ies) concerned, including PPSC.  
 
6. This petition is disposed of with the direction to 
respondent No.2 to re-visit the case of the petitioner by 
giving prospective effect to the omission of Rule 17-A 

4 
W.P. No.12771 of 2024 
 
of the Rules, 1974; and consider petitioner’s 
entitlement qua additional marks in accordance with 
the conditions prescribed and limitations provided in 
terms of Rule 17-A of the Rules, 1974.
