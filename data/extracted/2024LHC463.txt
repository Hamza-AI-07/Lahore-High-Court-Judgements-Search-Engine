Shahid Karim, J:-. This judgment will decide a cluster 
of Intra Court Appeals (Appendix-I) brought by the 
Income Tax Department / Federal Board of Revenue 
(FBR) and (Appendix-II) brought by the private parties 
to challenge the judgment passed by a learned Single 
Judge of this Court in W.P No.52559 of 2022 and a 
large number of connected constitutional petitions which 
were decided by the same judgment (The Impugned 
Judgment). At the centre of controversy is the 
provisions of Section 7E in Chapter II (Section 7E) with 
the caption ‘charge of tax’ in the Income Tax Ordinance, 
2001 (The 2001 Ordinance) which was inserted by the 
Finance Act, 2022.  The petitioners before the learned 
Single Judge (respondents in these ICAs) contended that 
section 7E is ultra vires the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (The Constitution) and 
beyond the powers of the National Assembly to 
promulgate as an impost of tax.  In conclusion, the 
learned Single Judge held that: 
27. For what has been discussed, it is held that; 
i. 
To treat the market value of immovable property 
as income under Entry 47 is beyond the 
competence of Federal Legislator, hence is 
declared ultra vires. 
ii. 
The provisions of Section 7E are read down to 
save the taxation on Capital Value of Assets, 
which 
is 
within 
competence 
of 
Federal 
Legislature under Entry 50. 
iii. 
The Entry 50 for taxing Capital Value of Assets 
requires that the assets should be valued as a 
whole and taxed inseparably. Curative legislation 
is expected to bring the provisions, of Section 7E, 
within the spirit of taxing Capital Value of Assets, 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
4 
 
and to harmonies it with other provisions of the 
Ordinance of 2001. 
iv. 
Exclusion of persons under clauses (i), (iii) and 
(iv) of Section 7E(2)(d), is discriminatory, 
offending the Article 25, therefore, are declared 
ultra vires. 
 
 
However, the legislature is expected to remove the 
pointed out expropriatory and confiscatory aspects in the 
provisions of Section 7E. 
 
 
The petitions are allowed to the extent and in the 
manner, noted in this judgment. 
 
2. 
The conclusion set out above makes it clear that 
the learned Single Judge held that treating the market 
value of immovable property as income under Entry 47 
of Fourth Schedule of the Federal Legislative List of the 
Constitution (Entry 47) was beyond the competence of 
the 
Parliament 
and 
proceeded 
to 
declare 
it 
unconstitutional on that basis.  Further, Section 7E was 
read down to save the levy as a Capital Value Tax 
(CVT) which was held to be within the competence of 
the Federal Legislature under Entry 50 of the Federal 
Legislative List of the Constitution (Entry 50).  Finally, 
the learned Single Judge expressed his “expectation” 
that the provisions of Section 7E would be amended by 
bringing about “curative legislation” in order to 
harmonize Section 7E “with other provisions of the 
Ordinance of 2001”.  This was directed on the notion 
that Entry 50 for the purpose of taxing capital value of 
assets requires that the “assets should be valued as a 
whole and taxed inseparably”.  The relief granted went 
on to hold that the exclusions contained in 7E (2) (d)(i), 
(iii) and (iv)  were discriminatory and offended Article 
25 of the Constitution. On that basis these provisions 
were also declared unconstitutional. 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023

3. 
The respondents who were the petitioners before 
the learned Single Judge have chosen not to challenge 
the Impugned Judgment.  Our analysis of the Judgment 
is that it does not strike down Section 7E and in terms of 
the conclusion set out above at paragraph 27(ii), the 
provisions of Section 7E were merely read down to save 
the taxation on capital value of assets which was held to 
be within the competence of Federal Legislature under 
Entry 50.  In the same vein, the learned Single Judge did 
not deem it proper to consider the tax to be within the 
field of Entry 47 as in the opinion of the learned Single 
Judge it was merely a tax on the market value of 
immovable property which could not be treated as 
income.  In sum, the learned Single Judge considered the 
tax to be one covered by Entry 50 as a tax on the capital 
value of assets but merely required an amendment to 
bring the entire set of capital assets within the ambit of 
the law.  If we were to view the conclusion drawn by the 
learned Single Judge holistically, the result reached was 
that the provisions of Section 7E were saved as also the 
tax which was imposed thereby.   
Counsel’s submissions: 
4. 
Learned counsel for the appellants, however, 
submitted that notwithstanding the conclusion set out 
above, the learned Single Judge took an erroneous view 
of Entry 47 as a field of legislative competence.  
According to the arguments in this Court, tax under 
Section 7E is squarely covered under Entry 47 and to 
transpose the tax to Entry 50 by the learned Single Judge 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
6 
 
was clearly erroneous.  The Appellants discountenanced 
the construction put on Section 7E and asserted that 
despite a clear holding by the superior courts, the 
learned Single Judge while ignoring those precedents 
went on to hold that tax on deemed income was 
unconstitutional.  Finally, it was stated that the Sindh 
High Court had upheld the provisions of Section 7E and 
the challenges made in Sindh to Section 7E were 
dismissed. 
5. 
Mr. Shahryar Kasuri, Advocate one of the 
counsels for the respondents contended that Section 7E 
was not covered by Entry 50 as the Federal Legislature 
could not impose CVT on immovable property.  
Secondly, that the assets which had been acquired and 
on which income tax had already been paid were exempt 
from payment of tax subsequently.  Thirdly, the plea of 
double taxation was also taken and in this regard it was 
argued that Section 7E would be tantamount to 
exproprietary taxation.  The learned counsels for 
respondents addressed more or less the same arguments 
while Mr. Shahbaz Butt, Advocate additionally argued 
that the tax was akin to one paid under Section 37 of the 
2001 Ordinance which was capital gain tax and therefore 
according to him Section 7E suffered from the vice of 
double taxation.   
6. 
Mr. Nasar Ahmad, learned Addl. Attorney 
General made submissions on behalf of the Federal 
Government and while supporting the appeals contended 
that a number of taxes on income could be levied and 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
7 
 
the Legislature was not constrained in any way to do so.  
He also alluded to the purpose of Section 7E which was 
not only to generate revenues but also to discourage a 
certain set of behaviour on the part of taxpayers.  The 
Appellants and the learned Addl. Attorney General 
placed entire reliance upon a case decided by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan and reported as Elahi Cotton 
Mills v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1997 SC 582) to 
which we shall advert during the course of our opinion. 
Taxation and its Attributes: 
7. 
It has been said by Martin Loughlin in ‘Idea of 
Public Law’ (Oxford OUP, 2003) that tax law is a 
practice of public law and is therefore a constitutive of 
the State.  It shapes the distribution of goods in society 
by allocating tax burden and tax transfers in furtherance 
of political decisions (John Snape in a book titled ‘Legal 
Interpretation of Tax Law (2nd Edition)).  We may 
emphasize the political nature of tax law as embodying 
reasons of state.  It has famously been said by Rowlatt J. 
in Cape Brandy Syndicate v IRC (1921) 12 TC 358 that 
“there is no equity about a tax”.  It was said in 
Lehnhausen v lake Shore Auto Parts Co. 410 U.S 356, 
364 (1973) by the US Supreme Court that a ‘tax is 
presumed to be constitutional and the burden is on the 
one attacking legislative arrangement to negative every 
conceivable basis which might support it”.  In ‘Treatise 
on the Law of Taxation” by Thomas M. Cooley (relied 
upon by the learned Addl. Attorney General and a 
masterpiece on the law of taxation), the taxing power 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
8 
 
has been stated to be an incident to sovereignty.  The 
concept has been articulated in the following words: 
“The taxing power an incident to sovereignty. The power 
of taxation is an incident of sovereignty, and is possessed 
by the government without being expressly conferred by the 
people. It is a legislative power; and when the people, by 
their constitutions, create a department of government 
upon which they confer the power to make laws, the power 
of taxation is conferred as part of the more general power. 
Even a wrongful government, if it be for the time being a 
government de facto, maintaining its authority and 
enforcing obedience to its laws, may exercise the power of 
taxation, and the power, so far as it has been completely 
enforced, must be recognized as lawful. But the overthrow 
of the de facto government defeats the power; and the 
rightful government will not thereafter aid in enforcing the 
uncollected levies.  
Every thing to which the legislative power extends 
may be the subject of taxation, whether it be person 
or property, or possession, franchise or privilege, or 
occupation 
or 
right. 
Nothing 
but 
express 
constitutional limitation upon legislative authority 
can exclude anything to which the authority extends 
from the grasp of the taxing power, if the legislature 
in its discretion shall at any time select it for revenue 
purposes. And not only is the power unlimited in its 
reach as to subjects, but in its very nature it 
acknowledges no limits, and may be carried to any 
extent which the government may find expedient. It 
may therefore be employed again and again upon the 
same subjects, even to the extent of exhaustion and 
destruction, and may thus become in its exercise a 
power to destroy. If the power be threatened with 
abuse, security must be found in the responsibility of 
the legislature which imposes the tax to the 
constituency who are to pay it. The judiciary can 
afford no redress against oppressive taxation, so long 
as the legislature in imposing it, shall keep within the 
limits of legislative authority and violate no express 
provision of the constitution. The necessity for 
imposing it addresses itself to the legislative 
discretion and it is or may be an urgent necessity 
which will admit of no property or other conflicting 
right in the citizen while its remains unsatisfied.” 
 
 
From the portion of the ‘Treatise’ set out above, 
it is clear that the power of taxation is unlimited in its 
reach as to subject and by its very nature it 
acknowledges no limits and may be carried to any extent 
which the government may find expedient.  The 
judiciary can afford no redress against taxation so long 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
9 
 
as the legislature in imposing it keeps within the limits 
of legislative authority and violate no express provisions 
of the constitution.  The ‘Treatise’ by Cooley relied 
upon hereinabove is a seminal study of taxation and is 
considered as an authority on the subject of taxes and 
their nature and kinds. 
8. 
In the context of the true construction of the word 
‘income’ as used in the Constitution and 2001 
Ordinance, we may refer to the observations made by a 
prominent US Supreme Court Judge Justice Oliver 
Wendell Holmes who stated in 254 US 418 with regard 
to the meaning to be ascribed to a word that “a word is 
not crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of 
a living thought and may vary in colour and content 
according to the circumstances and the time in which it 
is used”.   
9. 
This is true basis on which we have proceeded to 
consider the extent and meaning of the word ‘income’ as 
used in the Constitution and the law and have arrived at 
the conclusion by recognizing that the word ‘income’ 
has taken colour and content according to the 
circumstances and the times in which it has been used in 
the 2001 Ordinance. 
10. 
The sixteenth amendment to the US Constitution 
grants power on the Congress to impose taxes.  It 
provides that “the Congress shall have power to lay and 
collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, 
without apportionment among the several States and 
without regard to any census or enumeration.”   

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
10 
 
11. 
The courts in the U.S have had the occasion to 
dwell upon the power of the Congress to lay and collect 
taxes on incomes and the question regarding true import 
of what constitutes income have also arisen in various 
cases.  We may refer to some of the statements in 
‘Words and Phrases Permanent Edition Volume 20B’, 
which on the basis of the decisions of the courts referred 
to the interpretation of the word ‘income’ by the courts 
in the US. The distilled essence of the decisions and the 
conclusions drawn by courts on the term ‘income’ has 
been stated in the ‘Treatise’ in the following terms: 
“U.S 1947. “Income” within Sixteenth Amendment is not 
limited to direct receipt of cash. U.S.C.A. Const. Amend. 
16.__Crane v. C.I.R., 67 S.Ct. 1047, 331 U.S 1, 91 L.Ed. 
1301.__ Int Rev 3110 
C.C.A.2 1946. Income which is subject to a man’s 
unfettered command, and which he is free to enjoy at his 
own option, may be taxed to him as his “income” whether 
he sees fit to enjoy it or not. __ Hedrick V. C.I.R., 154 F.2d 
90, certiorari denied 67 S.Ct. 53, 329 U.S 719, 91 
L.Ed.623.__Int Rev 3110 
The term “income” as used in the Sixteenth Amendment 
and in the revenue statutes is not limited to cash income. “ 
12. 
“In all interpretations, our starting point of 
course is the language of the statute itself”. (464 U.S 
206, 214 [1984]).  Judge Learned Hand’s statement 
remains a classic invocation of the interpretive approach 
of purposivim.  The judge said “it is one of the surest 
indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to 
make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember 
that statutes always have some purpose or object to 
accomplish, 
whose 
sympathetic 
and 
imaginative 
discovery is the surest guide to their meaning”.  Cabell v 
Markham 148 F.2 d 737, 739. 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
11 
 
13. 
The chargeability to tax of deemed income is a 
universally accepted notion.  The subject, in the context 
of United Kingdom, is discussed in Halsbury’s Laws of 
England (Fourth Edition) (23) in the following words: 
“54.  Deemed income. For the purpose of preventing 
the avoidance of tax by such devices as settlements on 
infant children, gratuitous covenants to pay income to 
others, and the transfer of assets abroad, the Income 
Tax Acts contain provisions which deem for the 
purpose of those Acts income arising under such 
transactions to be that of someone other than the 
person to whom under the general law it would 
belong. In the absence of specific statutory authority 
income once deemed to be that of someone else 
cannot be further deemed to be that of yet another 
person.” 
 
14. 
The subject of statutory definitions has been at 
the forefront of our thoughts throughout the opinion.  
“Statutory definitions are a common feature in 
legislation and are typically used for one or more 
purposes… to enlarge or narrow the natural meaning of 
a term”.  (Bennion, Bailey and Norbury on Statutory 
Interpretation, Eighth Edition).  Bennion further refers 
to the kinds of definition as Inclusive and Exclusive 
definitions.  The term Inclusive definition has been 
stated to mean: 
(1) “An inclusive definition modifies the natural meaning of 
the defined term by enlarging it or clarifying potential 
doubt about what is covered. This kind of definition 
typically takes the form ‘X includes’. 
 
An inclusive definition is used to enlarge the meaning of the 
defined term to cover things that are not or might not 
otherwise be caught. It ‘does not normally affect the width 
of the term being enlarged’. The term as used in the Act has 
its natural meaning (which is left undefined) and in 
addition has the special meaning given to it by the inclusive 
definition. 
15. 
The term ‘income’ as defined in the 2001 
Ordinance, is a case of inclusive definition and is used to 
modify the natural meaning of ‘income’.  The definition 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
12 
 
has enlarged the meaning of the term to cover things that 
are not or might not otherwise be caught.  This is where 
a link may be established with an expanding field of 
fiscal sociology around the globe to emphasise that the 
terminology applies broadly to the role of taxation in 
social change.  In the contemporary constitutions of 
modern developed states, the institutional focus on the 
Economic and Political Constitution resonates strongly 
with the study of questions of tax law.  Scholars are 
influenced by the idea that a constitution is made up of a 
series of political decisions as to the basic structure of 
economic life.  (For a fuller discussion, see Tax Law, 
State-Building and the Constitution by Dominic de 
Cogan).  
16. 
In the words of John McEldowney, (The 
Changing Constitution, 8th edn. (Oxford, 2015): 
Political and economic pressures for the reduction of the 
budget deficit continue to require major cuts in public 
expenditure. This has had simultaneous effects on the 
delivery of many public services across most sectors of the 
economy. The financial crisis and political influences 
dominate the technical rules of financial reporting and 
control, with significant constitutional ramifications… 
17. 
Applying 
the 
purposive 
approach 
to 
the 
interpretation of Section 7E, we have no doubt that the 
purpose that the provision was enacted to accomplish, 
was to treat as income chargeable to tax, an amount 
equal to five percent of the fair market value of capital 
assets, which the taxpayers use for increase in wealth on 
account of rise in value of the immovable property.  The 
purpose is also clear from the speech of the Finance 
Minister and the accomplishment of the object of section 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
13 
 
7E cannot be frustrated by holding that the legislature 
does not have power to tax deemed income. 
Statutory and Constitutional framework: 
18. 
Section 7E of the 2001 Ordinance provides that: 
“7E. Tax on deemed income.- (1) For tax year 2022 
and onwards, a tax shall be imposed at the rates 
specified in Division VIIIC of Part-I of the First 
Schedule on the income specified in this section. 
 
(2) A resident person shall be treated to have derived, 
as income chargeable to tax under this section, an 
amount equal to five percent of the fair market value 
of capital assets situated in Pakistan held on the last 
day of tax year excluding the following, namely:– 
 
(a) one capital asset owned by the resident 
person; 
 
(b) self-owned business premises from where 
the business is carried out by the persons 
appearing on the active taxpayers’ list at any 
time during the year; 
 
(c) 
self-owned 
agriculture 
land 
where 
agriculture activity is carried out by person 
excluding farmhouse and land annexed 
thereto; 
 
(d) capital asset allotted to – 
(i) a Shaheed or dependents of a 
shaheed belonging to Pakistan Armed 
Forces; 
 
(ii) a person or dependents of the 
person who dies while in the service of 
Pakistan armed forces or Federal or 
provincial government; 
 
(iii) a war wounded person while in 
service of Pakistan armed forces or 
Federal or provincial government; and 
 
(iv) an ex-serviceman and serving 
personal of armed forces or ex-
employees or serving personnel of 
Federal and provincial governments, 
being original allottees of the capital 
asset duly certified by the allotment 
authority; 
 
(e) any property from which income is 
chargeable to tax under the Ordinance and 
tax leviable is paid thereon; 
 
(f) capital asset in the first tax year of 
acquisition where tax under section 236K has 
been paid; 
 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
14 
 
(g) where the fair market value of the capital 
assets in aggregate excluding the capital 
assets mentioned in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), 
(e) and (f) does not exceed Rupees twenty-five 
million; 
 
(h) capital assets owned by a provincial 
government or a local government; or (i) 
capital assets owned by a local authority, a 
development 
authority, 
builders 
and 
developers 
for 
land 
development 
and 
construction, subject to the condition that such 
persons are registered with Directorate 
General 
of 
Designated 
NonFinancial 
Businesses and Professions. 
 
Provided that the exclusions mentioned at 
clauses (a), (e), (f) and (g) of this sub-section 
shall not apply in case of a person not 
appearing in the active taxpayers’ list, other 
than persons covered in rule 2 of the Tenth 
Schedule.] 
 
(3) The Federal Government may include or exclude 
any person or property for the purpose of this section. 
(4) In this section– 
(a) “capital asset” means property of any kind 
held by a person, whether or not connected 
with a business, but does not include – 
(i) any stock-in-trade, consumable 
stores or raw materials held for the 
purpose of business; 
 
(ii) any shares, stocks or securities; 
 
(iii) any property with respect to which 
the person is entitled to a depreciation 
deduction 
under 
section 
22 
or 
amortization deduction under section 
24; or 
 
(iv) any movable asset not mentioned 
in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii); 
 
(b) “farmhouse” means a house constructed 
on a total minimum area of 2000 square yards 
with a minimum covered area of 5000 square 
feet used as a single dwelling unit with or 
without an annex: 
 
Provided that where there are more than one 
dwelling units in a compound and the average 
area of the compound is more than 2000 
square yards for a dwelling unit, each one of 
such dwelling units shall be treated as a 
separate farmhouse. 
 
19. 
It would be relevant to set out the definition of 
the term ‘income’ in the 2001 Ordinance which provides 
that: 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
15 
 
“2(29) “income” includes any amount chargeable to tax 
under this Ordinance, any amount subject to collection or 
deduction of tax under section 148, 150, 152(1), 153, 154, 
156, 156A, 233,  sub-section (5) of section 234, section 
236Z and any amount treated as income under any 
provision of this Ordinance] and any loss of income. 
 
20. 
The two entries in the Fourth Schedule to the 
Constitution at the heart of the arguments in this Court 
are Entry 47 and Entry 50, which provide that: 
“Entry 47: 
Taxes 
on 
income 
other 
than 
agricultural income. 
 
Entry 50: 
Taxes on the capital value of the 
assets, not including taxes on immovable property.” 
 
Section 7E: 
21. 
Section 7E would require unpacking as this would lend 
actuality to the analysis. Upon its reading, the first impression 
that comes out starkly is the essence of the tax given in 
subsection (1) to impose “a tax… on the income specified in 
this section.” This is bolstered by sub-section (2) which 
further articulates the intention of legislature to assume that a 
resident person derives an income chargeable to tax on capital 
assets situated in Pakistan held on the last day of the tax year. 
That income shall be treated to have been derived and will be 
taxed accordingly. Having defined the incidence of tax, the 
measure of tax is given as an “amount equal to five percent of 
the fair market value of capital assets.”   
22. 
But the incidence of tax, in essence, falls on the 
presumptive income of a resident person which he shall be 
deemed to derive from capital assets held by him. Thus the 
legislature presumes that a capital asset in the hands of a 
resident person, in the ordinary course is likely to yield 
certain income chargeable to tax. There is no doubt in our 
estimation that the tax is on income (though deemed) in 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
16 
 
contradistinction to tax on capital value of an asset covered 
by Entry 50. The two taxes are distinct and cannot be 
muddled inter se. The attempt on the part of the learned 
Single Judge to save section 7E by treating of it under Entry 
50 has no legal legs to stand upon. The concept of an income 
out of a capital asset has to be contrasted with the capital 
value of an asset. The definition of “capital asset” considered 
objectively leaves it in no manner of doubt that the tax 
ensnares immovable property of a resident person (barring 
certain exceptions enumerated therein) and no other capital 
assets. The budget speech made it evident that the 
Government of the day had reasonable grounds to believe that 
a substantial amount of investment was parked in real estate 
with potential for exponential growth in value. Section 7E is 
simply an attempt to treat the increment in value of a capital 
asset as income and the resident person cannot be left 
immersed in the thought of deriving double benefit viz. one, 
increase in value of his capital asset and, two, zero tax. In 
case he disposes of his capital asset, no tax is leviable under 
Section 7E. But beyond six years, the resident person does 
not pay capital gain tax on such sale, too. 
23. 
The tax has been levied on notional income but not a 
notional asset (from which it is deemed to arise). The 
legislature has intended to tax an asset apparently lying 
dormant and not generating an income in cash but indeed 
capable of increment in value. It is that value addition that 
section 7E seeks to tax. Notionally the augmentation in value 
does become part of taxpayer’s income. 
 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
17 
 
Taxing Land and Benefit from Land: 
24. 
“Land” observed Anthony Trollope “is about the only 
thing that can’t fly away”. When income tax was first 
introduced it was called a tax on property, profits and income. 
This was because the original rules did not tax income from 
property (or land) but imposed annual charges based on the 
value of land. For most part of long and tangled history, tax 
on property was by reference to value not income.  
(For this statement we are indebted to Davies: Principals of 
Tax Laws, Geoffery Morse and Sandra Eden, Ninth Edition) 
25. 
Section 7E in our opinion is a species of taxing income 
from property business (not from property as such) and more 
appropriately labelled as property income. We may pause 
here to emphasis a concept which ought to be borne in mind. 
What these provisions tax is the benefit that arises from 
exploiting a legal interest in land not the land itself. (See 
Lowe v Ashmore [1971]1 AllER 1057.)  
26.  
Further, income tax charge is on income and not 
capital receipts. The essence of the distinction between 
capital (a stock) and income (a flow) is of utmost 
importance.  Capital receipts are caught by Capital 
Gains Tax enacted by Section 37 of 2001 Ordinance. In 
ordinary parlance, although capital gain is not income 
per se, yet it has been treated as taxable income in 2001 
Ordinance. This is an illustration of  treating as income a 
sum which would not be income on a conceptual plane. 
In many jurisdictions, property income is now charged 
under provisions similar to those for trading income. In 
the case of section 7E as well, the legislature is 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
18 
 
convinced that persons holding properties in excess of a 
certain threshold are, in actual fact, trading in properties 
and must be taxed accordingly. In short, income tax is 
also imposed on receipts that are not income tax receipts 
but rather capital receipts. If such can be treated as 
income for purposes of income tax, then, by same 
analogy, deemed income can also be subjected to charge 
of income tax, by treating it as income. In other words 
this is taxing potential earning and would be considered 
imputed income from actual return on investment in the 
form of use rather than money. 
27. 
In the Fourth Schedule, Entries 43 to 54 deal with 
fields of legislation for taxation purposes for the 
Parliament.  As explicated, we are here concerned with 
Entries 47 and 50 which have been reproduced above.  
Entry 47 relates to taxes on income other than 
agricultural income.  The words used in Entry 47 are 
broad based and open-ended.  We will bear in the mind 
the oft-quoted and settled principles regarding entries in 
the Fourth Schedule to reiterate that these entries are not 
the actual source of power to vest in the Parliament. 
That power is derived from the substantive provisions in 
the Constitution. They are merely fields of legislation 
and these fields cannot be read restrictively so as to 
constrict the powers of the Parliament to pass 
legislation.  The term ‘income’ has not been defined in 
the Constitution and would take colour from its ordinary 
meaning or as a term of art which has acquired a 
definition historically and by the precedents of the 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
19 
 
superior courts.  The simple proposition in our opinion is 
that if the term ‘income’ has not been defined in a 
certain manner by the Constitution, it must be given its 
widest and broadest meaning and the amplitude of the 
term cannot be confined to mean a certain thing and not 
the other.  It would then be left to the legislature to 
define the term ‘income’ which has been done by 
providing a definition in the 2001 Ordinance as set out 
above. 
28. 
The definition of ‘income’ given in the 2001 
Ordinance does not restrict the meaning of the term 
‘income’ but uses the word ‘includes’ which would 
leave it open for a specific sum to be included in the 
term ‘income’ as the case may require.  By the Finance 
Act, 2003 the words “any amount treated as income 
under any provision of this Ordinance” were added to 
the definition.  With the addition of these words in the 
term ‘income’, we cannot help concluding that the 
legislature would deem any amount to be income if it 
has been treated as such under any provision of the 2001 
Ordinance.  It does not matter whether the amount so 
treated is tangible income in the form of cash or money 
or rather notional or deemed income.  If the legislature 
treats a certain amount as income then it must be held to 
be income for the purposes of chargeability of tax.  This 
is precisely what Section 7E has done by treating an 
income to be the notional income of a taxpayer at a 
certain time.  We may clarify however that the notional 
income is not such that it is incapable of being realised 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
20 
 
at a future time and in fact the premise of taxation under 
Section 7E is that in the foreseeable future that notional 
income would be converted into real tangible income in 
the hands of the taxpayer.  Section 7E presumes that a 
resident person has certain capital assets situated in 
Pakistan which though do not generate any income 
chargeable to tax but may be so charged to a notional 
income which the resident person shall be treated to 
have derived.  The measure of tax is an amount equal to 
5% of the fair market value of capital assets situated in 
Pakistan.  Thus, we have no doubt in our mind that 
Entry 47 applies to the provisions of Section 7E and is a 
tax on income duly covered by the term as defined in 
section 2(29) of the 2001 Ordinance.  The legislature has 
treated deemed/ notional income of a taxpayer holding a 
capital asset situated in Pakistan as a category of income 
and so the taxpayers cannot turn around and say that he 
cannot be taxed on such income being ultra vires.  If this 
were the case, the petitioners before the learned Single 
Judge ought to have challenged the words inserted by 
Finance Act, 2003 by which the notion of deemed 
income was introduced in the 2001 Ordinance.   
The case of Elahi Cotton: 
29. 
We will now advert our attention to the watershed 
case of Elahi Cotton which was the subject of discussion 
by both the learned counsel for the appellants and the 
respondents and each one of them attempted to draw an 
inference to suit his own case. 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
21 
 
30. 
Elahi Cotton squarely related to presumptive tax on 
income and the question dilated by a powerful Bench of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan was whether deemed income 
could be made part of the term ‘income’ and taxed 
accordingly.  The distilled essence of the precedents 
considered in Elahi Cotton  as well as the concepts regarding 
the term ‘income’ were encapsulated in paragraph 31 of the 
judgment and the learned counsel for the appellants have 
relied upon this paragraph in support of their arguments.  But, 
priorly, the provisions of section 80D of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 1979 (which was amongst others considered by 
the Supreme Court) may be set out below in order to bring 
home the similarity in the concept permeating the two 
provisions: 
80D. Minimum tax on income of certain companies and 
registered firm—(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in 
this Ordinance or any other law for the time being in force, 
where no tax is payable or paid by a company or a 
registered firm resident in Pakistan or the tax payable or 
paid is less than one-half per cent of the amount 
representing its turnover from all sources, the aggregate of 
the declared turnover shall be deemed to be income of the 
said company or a registered firm and tax thereon shall be 
charged in the manner specified in Sub-section (2). 
(2) 
The company or a registered firm referred to in 
Sub-section (1) shall pay as income tax: 
(a) 
an amount, where no tax is payable or paid 
equal to one-half per cent of the said turnover; and 
(b) 
an amount, where tax payable or paid is less 
than one-half per cernt of the said turnover, equal 
to the difference between the tax payable or paid 
and the amount calculated in accordance with 
clause (a).”  
31. 
The impost levied through section 80D above is, 
doubtless, on deemed income.  Apart from the measure of tax, 
there is no difference in the incidence of tax and the 
underlying intention to levy tax on deemed income.  For the 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
22 
 
purposes of the present appeals, the following observations 
made in Elahi Cotton are relevant and are set out below: 
“(ix) That the law should be saved rather than be 
destroyed and the Court must lean in favour of upholding 
the constitutionality of a legislation keeping in view that the 
rule of Constitutional interpretation is that there is a 
presumption in favour of the constitutionality of the 
legislative enactments unless ex facie it is violative of a 
Constitutional provision. 
(x) That as per dictionary the word 'income' means "a 
thing that comes in". Its natural meaning embraces any 
profit or gain which is actually received. However, while 
construing the above word used in an entry in a 
legislative list, the above restricted meaning cannot be 
applied keeping in view that the allocation of the subjects 
to the lists is not by way of scientific or logical definition 
but by way of mere simplex enumeration of broad 
categories. 
(xi) That the expression "income" includes not merely what 
is received or what comes in by exploiting the use of a 
property but also what one saves by using it oneself. For 
example, use of a house by its owner. 
(xii) That what is not "income" under the Income Tax Act 
can be made "income" by a Finance Act. An exemption 
granted by the Income Tax Act can be withdrawn by the 
Finance Act or the efficacy of that exemption may be 
reduced by the imposition of a new charge, of course, 
subject to Constitutional limitations. 
(xvii) That generally the effect of a deeming provision in a 
taxing statute is that it brings within the tax net an 
amount which ordinarily would not have been treated as 
an income. In other words, it brings within the net of 
chargeability income not actually accrued but which 
supposedly to have accrued notionally. 
(xviii) That when a statute enacts that something shall be 
deemed to have been done which in fact and in truth was 
not done, the Court is entitled and bound to ascertain for 
what purposes and between what persons the statutory 
fiction is to be resorted to. 
(xix) That where a person is deemed to be something the 
only meaning possible is that whereas he is not in reality 
that something, the Act required him to be treated as he 
were with all inevitable corollaries of that state of 
affairs.” 
32. 
The Supreme Court in Elahi Cotton firstly alluded to 
the well established principle that a law must be saved rather 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
23 
 
than destroyed and courts must lean in favour of 
constitutionality of a legislation.  Secondly, it was held that 
while construing the words in an Entry in the Legislative List 
restricted meaning cannot be applied keeping in view the rule 
that the allocation of the subjects to the lists is not by way of 
scientific or logical definition.  Thirdly, that the expression 
‘income’ includes not merely what is received or what comes 
in by exploiting the use of a property but also what one saves 
by using it oneself.  Fourthly, the effect of deeming provision 
of a taxing statute was discussed and it was stated that a 
deeming provision brings within the tax net an amount which 
ordinarily would not have been treated as income.  In short, it 
brings within the ambit of chargeability income not actually 
accrued but supposedly to have accrued notionally. 
33. 
Further alluding to the term ‘income’ it was observed 
in Elahi Cotton “The word "income" is susceptible as to 
include not only what is in ordinary parlance it conveys or it 
is understood, but what is deemed to have arisen or accrued. 
It is also manifest that income-tax is not only levied in the 
conventional manner i.e., by working out the net income 
after adjusting admissible expenses and other items, but the 
same may also be levied on the basis of gross receipts, 
expenditure etc. There are new species of income tax, 
namely, presumptive tax and minimum tax.”  
34. 
The above observations leave it in no manner of doubt 
that in Elahi Cotton the Supreme Court clearly held deemed 
income as part of the word ‘income’ used in Entry 47 of the 
Constitution and wide leeway has been given to the 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
24 
 
legislature to include notional income as income of a taxpayer 
and to impose tax accordingly.  While so holding the 
Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of section 80C 
and section 80D of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 which 
related to presumptive tax on deemed income. Our system of 
administration of justice is founded on the law of precedents 
and this also finds expression in Article 189 of the 
Constitution which clearly states that decisions of the 
Supreme Court are binding on other courts.  The decision in 
Elahi Cotton decided a question of law and is based upon and 
enunciates a principle of law and is thus binding on this 
Court.  It would be improper and erroneous on the part of this 
Court to ignore the clear ratio decidendi in Elahi Cotton as 
we do not find any distinction between what was decided in 
Elahi Cotton and the present appeals where a challenge has 
been laid to tax on deemed income and section 7E more 
particularly.  When juxtaposed, we do not find any sunlight 
between the present cases and Elahi Cotton and the question 
of law decided therein applies on all fours to these cases.  
Any challenge to section 7E should have been thrown out on 
the basis that the concept of deemed income has been 
recognized and upheld by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
Elahi Cotton and nothing further remains to be decided. 
35. 
Similar challenges were brought before the Sindh High 
Court and a Division Bench at Karachi proceeded to dismiss 
the petitions in inter alia C.P No.4614 of 2022. The Sindh 
High Court relied upon the judgment of Elahi Cotton and 
stated as follows: 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
25 
 
“As to the argument that a tax has been levied without 
there being any transaction not resulting in any income, it 
would suffice that again the same does not appear to be a 
correct approach as apparently holding of property beyond 
the threshold as provided in Section 7E(2)(g) is by itself a 
transaction which has been deemed to be an income within 
the ambit of Section 7E ibid. Similarly, the argument that a 
transaction only occurs when an actual amount of income 
has been received is also misconceived as apparently a 
deemed income concept has been upheld by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court in Elahi Cotton case and we need not go 
any further to elaborate the said concept of deemed income 
which apparently is an income, notwithstanding that it is 
being received in terms of money or otherwise. It is a 
fictional income concept, and if at all, it is to be relatable 
to an actual transaction or an attempt to generate an 
income, as contended, it would then not be an income 
deemed to have arisen. Deemed income of a tax-payer is 
always not an actual income; hence, if the conditions of an 
enactment are satisfied, it is deemed income, irrespective of 
the actual transaction. This is what the concept of a 
deemed income is. Any other interpretation and meaning 
would not be a deemed income; but an actual income. A 
fictional income is not needed to create a situation which 
already exists in reality. It is an income which is deemed to 
have arisen and that is all. Once it is so, then any other 
relative happenings are materially irrelevant. 
The 
definition of income is an inclusive definition; it enlarges 
the meaning of income. An income from property which has 
been made liable to tax is not its actual income in money 
but an artificial or statutory income as explained in the 
impugned section 7E of the Ordinance. In fact, by way of 
insertion of this Section another head of income has been 
created; though fictionally. Therefore the fact that the 
owner of the property receives no income in fact or even 
that there is no possibility of his receiving an income is 
irrelevant for the consideration of the question as to what 
the artificial or statutory income of an assessee is from 
property.” 
36. 
While on the subject, a reference may also be made to 
section 113 of 2001 Ordinance which is headed ‘minimum 
tax on the income of certain persons’.  The provision applies 
to certain taxpayers who have declared loss for the years, are 
exempt from tax or after claiming of allowances or 
deductions, no tax is payable for the tax year.  In such cases, 
by Sub-section (2), the aggregate of the persons’ turnover (as 
defined in Sub-section (3) shall be treated as the income of 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
26 
 
the person for the year chargeable to tax.  Again the notion 
of deemed income has been applied to treat the turnover of a 
person, as income.  In this manner, these categories of 
taxpayers are also made chargeable to tax by treating the 
amount of turnover as their income based upon the extended 
meaning given in section 2(29) of 2001 Ordinance.  Sections 
7E and 113belong to the same genre and such provisions are 
now woven into the fibre of our tax laws. 
37. 
Learned counsel for the respondents relied upon a 
judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan which is a three-
members judgment and reported as Pakistan Industrial 
Development Corporation v. Pakistan through Secretary 
Ministry of Finance (1992 SCMR 891) (PIDC case).  This 
case came under discussion in Elahi Cotton and was 
distinguished.  The observations made in PIDC case were not 
approved in Elahi Cotton which was decided by larger Bench 
of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the following terms: 
“As regards cases of Pakistani origin referred to 
hereinabove in para.29, it may be observed that the learned 
counsel for the appellants heavily relied upon the case of 
Government of Pakistan and others v. Muhammad Ashraf 
and others (supra) mentioned in sub-para. (viii) of para.29 
hereinabove, the same has been again dealt with herein-
below in para.44. Reliance was also placed by the learned 
counsel for the appellants on certain observations in the 
case of Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation v. 
Pakistan (supra) mentioned at para. 29(vii) hereinabove, 
particularly on the general observation that "thus the 
deeming provision in section 4 of the Act By this provision 
anything which is not income cannot be treated as income 
Before charging tax an assessee must be shown to have 
received income or it has arisen and accrued or deemed to 
be so", (which has been referred to hereinabove in sub-
para. (xxxiii) of para. 31). 
The above observations no doubt seemingly support the 
learned counsel for the appellants, but the same are to be 
viewed with reference to the context in which they were 
made, namely, whether the definition of income as extended 
by newly-added section 2(6-C) of the late Act, whereby 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
27 
 
even free reserves exceeding paid-up ordinary share 
capital of the company as on the last day of the previous 
year, was included in the income. The above provisions 
were not declared ultra vires by this Court in the above 
report. Furthermore, the above general observation 
founded on traditional approach cannot be pressed into 
service to examine the Constitutional validity of the above 
three impugned sections.” 
38. 
It can be seen that the observations made in PIDC case 
were not approved in Elahi Cotton and it was specifically 
stated that general observations founded on traditional 
approach could not be pressed into service to examine the 
Constitutional validity of three sections impugned in Elahi 
Cotton.  In short, Elahi Cotton did not favour restrictive 
meaning of the term ‘income’ as used in Entry 47.  The High 
Court of Sindh in the case referred to above, was also of the 
opinion that no reliance could be placed on PIDC case and 
that the holding in PIDC case had been disapproved by the 
Supreme Court in the later case of Elahi Cotton. 
Error Regarding Source of Levy: 
39. 
The controversy before the learned Single Judge 
turned on whether the levy was covered by Entry 47 or 
Entry 50. 
40. 
Entry 50 was the subject matter of discussion in a 
number of appeals before a Division Bench of which 
one of us (Shahid Karim, J.) was a member and it was 
held that tax on capital value of immovable property was 
beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament and 
was within the power of the Provincial Assemblies to 
legislate upon.  We will advert to this aspect and the 
holding of this Court in the later part of this judgment. 
41. 
At the cost of repetition, it is reiterated that the 
allocation of the subjects to the lists is not by way of 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
28 
 
scientific or logical definition but by way of mere simple 
enumeration of broad categories.  A single tax may 
derive its sanction from one or more entries and many 
taxes may emanate from one single entry. An entry in 
the Legislative List must be given a wide and liberal 
interpretation. 
42. 
Entry 47 simply says that the legislature has the 
power to impose taxes on income other than agricultural 
income.  The learned Addl. Attorney General is right 
when he contends that the words used would mean a 
wide array of different taxes which may be imposed on 
income and this is clearly discernible from reading of 
the Ordinance which indeed imposes taxes of different 
nature on the income of a person or different persons.  It 
may be that the legislature chooses to impose a tax on 
certain set of persons and to grant exemption in respect 
of the other set of persons.  By this mere categorization 
the tax will not be unconstitutional.  Moreover, a person 
may be subjected to more than one taxes on his income 
to be caught by double taxation.  In case the law permits 
clearly and without equivocation, such a tax would not 
be unlawful by the mere fact that it taxes the same 
income twice over.  It has been said that “the power to 
tax twice is as ample as to tax once”.  (Cited with 
approval in a number of U.S Supreme Court cases). 
43. 
As stated earlier, the term ‘income’ has not been 
defined in the Constitution.  The intention is clear and 
we do not harbour any doubt in this regard viz. that the 
framers of the Constitution intended the term to be 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
29 
 
elastic in the hands of the legislature to define it in 
whatever manner it deems appropriate in a given case.  
This is the very essence of Entry 47 and to attribute an 
intention to restrict or circumvent the powers of the 
legislature to define the term ‘income’ would be an 
unconstitutional argument. 
44. 
For the purposes of these cases, the important 
words in the definition are “any amount treated as 
income under any provision of this Ordinance”.  These 
words do not convey the meaning as proffered by the 
learned Single Judge to mean that the word “amount” 
used in this sentence would relate to a tangible and 
realisable amount and not an amount which is notional.  
This would be reading the word ‘amount’ separately and 
out of context with the entire sentence reproduced 
above.  The sentence “any amount treated as income 
under any provision of this Ordinance” has to be read as 
a whole.  Clearly, these words, when read as a whole, 
would convey ineluctably that the legislature may treat 
any amount as income and the use of word ‘treated’ is 
crucial and would connote an amount which may be 
deemed or imputed as income.  Otherwise there was no 
logical basis for insertion of these words so as to confer 
power on the legislature to treat certain amounts as 
income.  The purpose of these words cannot be defeated 
by a fantastic set of reasoning to achieve a desired result. 
45. 
It may be noted that income tax is imposed for 
each tax year at the rate specified in different Divisions 
of Part I of the First Schedule on every person who has 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
30 
 
taxable income for the year (Sec. 4 of the Ordinance).  
Section 9 relates to the term ‘taxable income’ and 
provides that: 
“9. Taxable income.—The taxable income of a person 
for a tax year shall be the total income under clause 
(a) of section 10 of the person for the year reduced 
(but not below zero) by the total of any deductible 
allowances under Part IX of this Chapter of the 
person for the year.” 
 
46. 
Thus, taxable income as envisaged in the Ordinance 
would mean the total income of a person for the year reduced 
by the total of any deductible allowances.  Section 10 of the 
Ordinance further defines the term ‘total income’ to mean a 
persons’ income under all heads of income for the year. The 
heads of income have been provided in section 11 and include  
salary, income from property, income from business, capital 
gains and income from other sources.  These heads of income 
clearly relate to real and tangible income and so the 
legislature in including the words “any amount treated as 
income under any provision of this Ordinance’ was cognizant 
of what taxable income was and so proceeded to extend the 
meaning of the term ‘income’ to include deemed and notional 
income imputable to a taxpayer. 
47. 
Notwithstanding the above and even if we were to 
ignore the definition of the word ‘income’ used in the 
Ordinance, section 7E refers to an amount which has been 
treated  as income under the provisions of the Ordinance and 
the legislature has sought to do so under its powers conferred 
by Entry 47 which, to reiterate, does not give a restrictive and 
cloistered meaning to the term ‘income’.  In our considered 
view, a resort to the definition of income as given in the

dictionaries cannot be had since the term has already been 
defined in the Ordinance and section 7E clearly refers to tax 
on deemed income.  In doing so, the legislature is imposing a 
tax on deemed income being fully aware of the sweep of the 
term ‘income’ as used in the Constitution to include deemed 
income.   
Parliamentary Debates: 
48. 
The learned counsel for the appellants also referred to 
the budget speech of 2022-23 by the Finance Minister who 
while placing before the National Assembly the budget 
proposals stated that: 
“The major part of the wealth of rich people is parked in 
the real estate sector in Pakistan.  This is a double-faceted 
menace.  It leads to the accumulation of unproductive 
assets and raises the prices of housing for the poor and 
lower-income groups.  We intend to correct this imbalance.  
Therefore, all persons who have more than one immovable 
property exceeding Rs.25 million situated in Pakistan shall 
be deemed to have received rent equal to 5% of the fair 
market value of the immovable property and shall pay tax 
at the rate of 1% of the fair market value of the said 
property.  However, one house of each individual will be 
excluded.” 
49. 
It is not unusual for the courts to rely upon 
Parliamentary debates as an extrinsic material to gauge the 
intention of the legislation.  The milestone case in relation to 
looking beyond the legislative wording was Pepper v. Hart 
(1992) 65 TC 421 which opened up transcendent 
interpretative 
possibilities 
by 
allowing 
reference 
to 
parliamentary record to establish parliamentary intention 
while interpreting legislation which is ambiguous or obscure.  
The case of Pepper has been cited with approval by our 
superior courts which have also used the concept to analyse 
the parliamentary debates for reaching the true intention 
behind a legislative measure.  Although in this case we do  

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
32 
 
not find the legislation to be ambiguous or obscure, we have 
merely referred to the budget speech in order to establish that 
the impugned tax was directed at the wealth of rich people 
parked in real estate sector in Pakistan. This aspect of the 
matter is widely known and governments over the years have 
struggled to bring this sector within the tax net.  Real estate 
sector in Pakistan which, in the opinion of the Finance 
Minister, is accumulation of unproductive assets raises the 
price of housing for the poor and lower income groups.  It 
was under these circumstances that the persons who have 
more than one immovable properties exceeding worth 25 
million and resident in Pakistan, will be deemed to have 
received income equal to 5% of the fair market value of the 
immovable property.  In doing so, legislature was acutely 
aware that tax is very much a social and institutional practice 
and therefore proceeded to tax a social practice having 
significant ramifications. 
Reading Down: 
50. 
The learned Single Judge has employed the rule 
of reading down to recast the provisions of section 7E in 
an attempt to “save the legislation, within competence 
under Entry 50”.  Thus, although the learned Single 
Judge was of the opinion that the tax was outwith the 
powers under Entry 47, it was nevertheless covered by 
Entry 50 and should be deemed as a tax on the capital 
value of assets within the meaning of Entry 50.  By this 
method, the learned Single Judge in fact saved the levy 
under Section 7E.  Since we have held that the tax is 
covered by Entry 47 and is a tax on income, though 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
33 
 
deemed, this portion of the impugned judgment falls to 
the wayside.  We may however observe that the rule of 
reading down is rarely applied by the courts in Pakistan 
and in fact, in our opinion, is a rule to be disapplied for 
countries with a written constitution.  It is a concept 
peculiar to the U.K administration of justice which does 
not have a written constitution and the courts have fallen 
back on the rule of reading down (or reading in) to save 
a statutory provision or to conform it with constitutional 
principles.  What the learned Single Judge has in fact 
done is to resort to judicial legislation by deleting some 
words from section 7E and substituting the others.  In 
conclusion, the learned Single Judge also impressed 
upon the legislature to harmonize section 7E with the 
spirit of “taxing capital value of assets” so that the assets 
could be valued as a whole and taxed inseparably.  Once 
again this was in the nature of Advisory declaration.  
That is why we have failed to understand as to how the 
respondents have felt satisfied with the ultimate 
conclusion drawn in the impugned judgment.  Suffice to 
say that the courts cannot use the device of reading 
down in order to re-write a statutory provision.  There is 
no compulsion on the courts to save legislation and if it 
is 
beyond 
the 
legislative 
competence 
and 
is 
unconstitutional, it must be struck down and not saved.   
Section 7E & Section 37 of the 2001 Ordinance: 
51. 
Mr. Shahbaz Butt, Advocate, representing some 
of the respondents drew a comparison between section 
7E and section 37 of the Ordinance to assert that the 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
34 
 
taxpayers were being subjected to double taxation as 
these were taxes of same genus.  This argument was not 
raised before the learned Single Judge and thus there is 
no obligation on us to consider it at the appellate stage.  
Yet, the argument is rebutted with the following 
observations: 
 Section 7E concerns with tax on income whereas 
section 37 is a tax on capital gains. 
 Income is either earned or deemed to be earned 
from various sources during the tax year 
regardless of sale or disposal of any asset whereas 
tax on capital gains is a tax on profits arising 
from eventual sale/ disposal of an asset. 
 
52. 
It is the realization of gains from appreciation in 
the value of an asset and clearly if no gain arises from 
disposal of asset then no tax on capital gains is liable to 
be paid.  In other words, while income tax is applied on 
the entire amount of the taxable income, capital gains is 
applied to the extent of gain in amount from a particular 
asset and not on the entire money received by the 
taxpayer from the disposal of asset.  Sub-clause (2)(f) of 
section 7E provides that for a property on which tax 
under Section 236K (advance tax on purchase or transfer 
of immovable property) has been paid that taxation will 
be excluded from the ambit of section 7E for the first tax 
year of acquisition.  Further, section 8 of the Ordinance 
provides that tax under Section 7E shall be a final tax on 
the amount in respect of which the tax is imposed. 
53. 
Capital gain tax is imposed under Section 37 at 
the rates given in Division VIII of Part I of the First 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
35 
 
Schedule to the Ordinance and presupposes that i) the 
immovable property was purchased by the taxpayer, ii) 
sold by the taxpayer; iii) at a price higher than the 
purchase price resulting in capital gain, iv) sold within 
five years of its purchase.  It is pertinent to mention that 
rate of capital gains tax on the holding period exceeding 
six years is zero per cent.  Therefore, it is not guaranteed 
that the property will be sold at all and meet the 
conditions (i) to (iv) above so as to attract capital gains 
tax.  Ms. Asma Hamid, Advocate who prepared a Note 
in this regard and from which we have had the benefit of 
making the distinctions above further supported her 
arguments with illustrations in order to underline the 
difference between incidence of tax under Section 7E 
and section 37 of the Ordinance: 
i. 
“Assume that a Purchases a property in tax year 2002, 
which he later sells within that tax year for a higher price. 
A’s income is taxable under Section 37 as he incurred 
capital gains, however, it is not taxable under Section 7E 
because that property was not held on the last day of the 
tax year.  
 
ii. 
Similarly, assume that A purchases a property in tax year 
2022 for which withholding tax under Section 236K has 
been paid, and which he later sells for a higher price in tax 
year 2023. A is liable to pay tax under Section 37 at the 
prescribed rate as he incurred capital gains for tax year 
2023. A is not liable to pay tax under Section 7E in respect 
of deemed income from this immovable property either in 
tax year 2022 (as per sub-clause 2(f) of Section 7E), and 
neither in tax year 2023 because the property was not held 
on the last day of the year 2023.  
 
iii. 
Assume that A inherits a property in tax year 2022 and 
holds it till the last day of that tax year, A will be liable for 
tax under Section 7E as he is holding the property on the 
last day of the tax year 2022. However, A may not be liable 
to pay tax under Section 37 as there is no disposal of the 
property by A.  
 
iv. 
Assume that A purchased a property in tax year 2022 for 
which tax under Section 236K has been paid, and sells the 
same at a higher price in tax year 2025. In this situation, A 
is liable to pay tax under Section 7E for tax year 2023 and 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
36 
 
tax year 2024. The gain earned by A is also liable to be 
taxed under Section 37 in tax year 2025. 
 
54. 
It is clear from the above illustrations that the 
incidence of tax in respect of both sections 7E and 37 of 
the Ordinance are distinct and separate and are triggered 
under different circumstances.  There is no duplication 
in the imposition of taxes under Section 7E and 37 and 
the question of double taxation does not arise. 
Exemptions and Discrimination: 
55. 
Sub-section (2) of section 7E excludes certain 
capital assets from the ambit of tax under Section 7E.  
We are here concerned with the following capital assets 
which were declared to be unconstitutional by the 
learned Single Judge on the ground that Article 25 of the 
Constitution did not permit such classification to be 
made.  Clause (d) of Sub-section (2) of section 7E 
provides that: 
(d) capital asset allotted to – 
 
(i) a Shaheed or dependents of a 
shaheed belonging to Pakistan 
Armed Forces; 
 
(ii) a person or dependents of the 
person who dies while in the service 
of 
Pakistan 
armed 
forces 
or 
Federal or provincial government; 
 
(iii) a war wounded person while in 
service of Pakistan armed forces or 
Federal or provincial government; 
and 
 
(iv) an ex-serviceman and serving 
personal of armed forces or ex-
employees or serving personnel of 
Federal 
and 
provincial 
governments, 
being 
original 
allottees of the capital asset duly 
certified by the allotment authority; 
 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
37 
 
56. 
The capital assets enumerated above have been 
excluded from taxation under Section 7E but in the 
impugned judgment this exclusion was held to be 
unconstitutional.  The learned Single Judge relied upon 
the well-worn test regarding discriminatory legislation 
as vouched by respectable authority and the superior 
courts have relied upon it in a number of precedents.  
These principles have also been reiterated in Elahi 
Cotton Mills where it was stated that persons similarly 
situated are to be treated alike and if there is a 
reasonable classification to be made, it must be founded 
on intelligible criteria having rational nexus to the 
objectives sought to be achieved by such classification. 
57. 
The classification which was made in section 7E 
is in respect of capital assets allotted to certain persons 
which include Shaheeds of Pakistan Armed Forces or 
their dependents, persons who died while in the service 
of Pakistan Armed Forces or Federal or Provincial 
Government etc.  It must be borne in mind that the 
exclusion is in respect of capital asset and not in respect 
of persons and strictly therefore the provisions of Article 
25 are not attracted.  If the rule applied by learned Single 
Judge were to hold sway, the entire Sub-section (2) 
should have been struck down being discriminatory and 
not merely clause (d) of Sub-section (2). 
58. 
Notwithstanding the above, we do not find clause 
(d)(i to iv) to be suffering from vice of discriminatory 
legislation which could be held to offend Article 25 of 
the Constitution.  Sub-section (2) (d)(i to iv) indeed 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
38 
 
carves out categories of persons which are distinct and 
apart from general category of taxpayers.  There is no 
cavil that the legislature is indeed empowered to create 
categories of taxpayers and to tax one and not other.  
The only rule which constrains that power has been set 
out above.  We do not find the categories so made to 
violate that rule. 
59. 
Section 7E (2)(d)(i) has been held to be 
unconstitutional as in the opinion of the learned Single 
Judge, Shaheeds and dependents of police and other 
forces have been left out of this class who are similarly 
placed.  Suffice to say that next paragraph (ii) has been 
held to be not discriminatory although that paragraph 
contemplates Shaheed and dependents of police and 
other forces.  Therefore, the very basis of holding of (i) 
is erroneous.  Similarly, section 7E (2)(d)(iii) has also 
been held to be unconstitutional and the learned Single 
Judge has equated this category with a labourer who also 
should be compensated for a wound or being disabled.  
We will reiterate that this category relates to person in 
the service of Pakistan Armed Forces or Federal or 
Provincial Government who are wounded in times of 
war.  Certainly, a labourer will not be employed at the 
time of war and it will only be the persons in service of 
Pakistan Armed Forces and other security forces 
attached with Federal or Provincial Government.  Thus, 
in our opinion, it creates a distinct category which is not 
discriminatory at all.  Lastly, section 7E (2)(d)(i) is also 
a category apart and relates to ex-service men and 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
39 
 
service personnel of armed forces or serving personnel 
of Federal and Provincial Governments who are original 
allottees of a capital asset duly certified by the allotment 
authority.  Once again, this category cannot be equated 
with persons generally who have purchased capital 
assets from their own earning.  The category relates to 
salaried class in the service of Federal and Provincial 
Government who have limited means and are allotted a 
capital asset during the tenure of their service.  They 
have limited financial means to acquire an asset 
otherwise and should not be burdened with the 
imposition of tax under Section 7E.  This portion of the 
impugned judgment contained in paragraph 25 is also set 
aside having been issued on an erroneous view of law. 
60. 
Before we tear ourselves away, it is indeed 
incredulous to note that the respondents chose not to 
challenge the Impugned Judgment which has, in actual 
fact, upheld the levy by saving it under Entry 50.  This 
was done by reading down.  The respondents were not 
spared the taxation under Section 7E. 
61. 
In conclusion, we allow the appeals (Appendix-I 
attached with this judgment).  The Impugned Judgment 
is set aside. 
62. 
The Appeals at Appendix-II (attached with this 
judgment) have been filed by the appellants (petitioners 
before the Single Bench) on the ground that the relief granted 
by the learned Single Judge is materially opposed to what was 
sought in the constitutional petitions. We allow these appeals 
on the same basis as above. But, in the same vein, the 

 
ICA No.35908 of 2023 
40 
 
respective constitutional petitions brought by these appellants 
will be dismissed for the reasons enumerated above.
