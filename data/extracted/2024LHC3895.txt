Ms. Nosheen Nazeer Raja, Advocate for the 
Appellant. 
Mr. 
Irshad 
Hussain 
Wattoo, 
Advocate 
for 
Respondent. 
 
  
This regular first appeal under Section 96 of The 
Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (the “CPC”) is 
directed against the judgment and decree dated 08.11.2023, 
whereby the Additional District Judge, Mianwali decreed 
the suit filed by the Respondent as ex-parte. 
2. 
Brief facts of instant appeal are that the Respondent 
instituted a suit for recovery of Rs.70,000,000/- in terms of 
Order 
XXXVII 
of 
the 
“CPC” 
against 
the 
Appellant/defendant claiming therein that the Appellant 
misappropriated an amount of Rs.79,617,591/- by 
committing criminal breach of trust and in this respect, a 
criminal case bearing F.I.R.No.100/22 u/s 406 PPC, P.S. 
Daud Khel was registered. It was further claimed that an 
amicable settlement was effected, pursuant thereto, the 
Respondent wrote off an amount of Rs.9,617,591/- 
however, for remaining amount the Appellant/defendant 
issued a cheque No.77953245 dated 17.01.2023 for the 
purposes of payment of remaining amount. The cheque, 

R.F.A.No.20 of 2024 
 
           2 
when presented in the concerned bank, the same was 
dishonoured. The Appellant was proceeded against ex parte 
on 30.05.2023. The learned trial court thereafter recorded 
ex-parte evidence and consequently decreed the suit as such 
vide judgment and decree dated 08.11.2023.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the Appellant inter alia 
submitted that the impugned judgment is not tenable under 
the law; that the Appellant was not afforded proper 
opportunity of hearing and ex-parte judgment is not tenable; 
that despite ex-parte proceedings, the Respondent was 
obliged to lead cogent and convincing evidence for proving 
its claim; that evidence to this effect was deficient but the 
Additional District Judge decreed the suit on extraneous 
reasons. 
4. 
Conversely, 
learned 
counsel 
the 
Respondent 
defended the impugned judgment with hilt. 
5. 
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and 
also perused the record.  
6. 
As the suit was in a summary character and it was 
instituted while invoking the provisions of Order XXXVII 
the “CPC”, so on receipt of the plaint, summons were 
issued to the Appellant in the prescribed form. In pursuance 
thereof, the Appellant put his appearance and filed 
application for leave to defend the suit on 10.04.2023 which 
was accepted vide order dated 06.05.2023 subject to his 
furnishing surety bond backed by some immovable property 
equal to the amount of cheque to the satisfaction of the 
Court. Thereafter, the Appellant filed petition for review of 
order dated 06.05.2023 that was dismissed vide order dated 
20.05.2023 with direction to the Appellant to furnish 
requisite surety bond otherwise his application for leave to 
appear and defend the suit shall be deemed to be rejected. 
On 30.05.2023, application for leave to defend was rejected 

R.F.A.No.20 of 2024 
 
           3 
due to non-submission of surety bond and case was fixed 
for recording of ex parte evidence that was ultimately 
decreed vide ex parte judgment and decree dated 
08.11.2023.   
7. 
Adverting to the merits of the case, it is observed that 
suit was instituted on the basis of Exh.P1 (Company board 
resolution, copy of F.I.R.No.100/2022 as Exh.P2 and copy 
of Cheque as Exh.P3) purportedly issued by the Appellant, 
which was dishonoured on presentation to the concerned 
bank. The Respondent in order to prove the validity of the 
cheque 
produced 
Mehmood-ul-Hassan, 
Executive 
Marketing Maple Leaf as PW1 and Muhammad Usman as 
PW-2. It evinces from the record that the Appellant had 
categorically denied the issuance of cheque (Exh.P3) in 
favour of the Respondent however, for the purpose of 
recording of evidence, leave to defend was conditionally 
allowed vide order dated 06.05.2023. When confronted 
whether there is any agreement between the parties to show 
the relationship of the Appellant and the Respondent; in 
response, learned counsel for the Appellant stated that 
cheque was given through some agreement which is not on 
the file of this case rather in another file of criminal 
proceedings but the Respondent has not shown any 
relationship before the Court. Chapter-II of the Negotiable 
Instrument Act, 1881 deals with promissory note, bill of 
exchange and cheques etc. Cheque is defined under Section 
6 of the Act ibid which reads: 
A “cheque” is a bill of exchange drawn on a 
specified banker and not expressed to be 
payable otherwise than on demand”.  
 
8. 
Order XXXVII Rule 2 of the “CPC” envisages that a 
suit can be instituted in a summary character on the basis of 
bills of exchange, hundies or promissory notes. As the 

R.F.A.No.20 of 2024 
 
           4 
cheque is a negotiable instrument under the Negotiable 
Instrument Act, 1881 and without negotiation of the parties 
on an agreement, no such suit could be filed. When 
confronted to counsel for the Respondent, whether he has 
copy of agreement, he stated that he does not have such copy 
however, the same will be produced before the trial Court if 
an opportunity is provided. He further stated that the 
Appellant was the employee of the Respondent who 
misappropriated certain amount as a result whereof criminal 
cases were registered against him during the proceedings of 
which, he agreed to pay certain amount as per agreement 
between the parties which shows the relationship for filing 
of suit. We have examined the judgment and observed that 
the Respondent has only exhibited three documents (Exh.P1 
to Exh.P3), mentioned above. It has been held in a number 
of cases that suit under Order XXXVII of the “CPC” has to 
be filed alongwith supporting negotiable instruments of the 
parties, instrument through a contract or through any 
relationship, which must be express, implied or in written 
form or oral. At this stage, learned counsel for the 
Respondents requested some time to file the agreement 
before the trial Court. It is settled law that for the purpose of 
filing suit there has to be a relationship between the parties 
as has been held by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in  
“Mehr NOOR MUHAMMAD Versus NAZIR AHMED” 
(PLD 2024 Supreme Court 45) wherein it has held that 
“the plaintiff, in his cross-examination, admitted that he 
had no business relationship with the defendant or family 
ties with him. This statement causes eyebrows to be raised 
as given a fillip to ponder how the plaintiff could lend a 
considerable amount to a stranger”. In another 
pronouncement cited in “TELENOR MICROFINANCE 
BANK LIMITED Versus SHAMIM BANO and others” 

R.F.A.No.20 of 2024 
 
           5 
(2023 SCMR 1560) it has held that “where a person signs 
an instrument otherwise than as a maker, drawer or 
accepter, he incurs the liabilities of an indorser to a holder 
in due course. However, if there is ambiguity as to the 
capacity in which a party signed an instrument, the whole 
facts and circumstances attendant upon the making, issue 
and transfer of the instrument may be legitimately referred 
to for the purpose of ascertaining the true relation of the 
parties to each other; and reasonable inferences, derived 
from these facts and circumstances are admitted to the effect 
of qualifying, altering or even inverting the relative 
liabilities which the law merchant would otherwise assign 
to them”.  Moreover, in “CHAND BAGH FOUNDATION 
through Authorized Representative Versus STANDARD 
CHARTERED BANK LIMTIED through Manager and 
another” (PLD 2011 Lahore 473), it has held that “the 
reasons given by the learned trial Court for dismissing the 
suit of the appellant namely absence of relationship of 
debtor and creditor and existence of a loan, are neither 
sustainable nor in line with dicta of the Supreme Courts”. 
When further confronted to counsel for the Appellant 
whether the Appellant had submitted surety bond as 
directed in aforesaid order, he stated that the Appellant 
could not furnish surety bond due to his poor financial 
position and incapacity at that time, however, he is now 
ready to furnish surety bond.  
9. 
In this view of the matter, without going into the other 
merits of the case, we are inclined to allow this appeal 
subject to furnishing of surety bond backed by some 
immovable property to the extent of 50% of the amount of 
cheque (Exh.P3) before the trial Court. The impugned 
judgment and decree is therefore, set aside. Consequently, 
petition for leave to defend stands accepted and trial Court 

R.F.A.No.20 of 2024 
 
           6 
shall decide the suit afresh after recording the evidence of 
the parties, in accordance with law preferably within a 
period of four months. The Respondent shall also file 
certain documents before the trial Court through proper 
application. The parties shall appear before the Court 
concerned on 25.09.2024.
