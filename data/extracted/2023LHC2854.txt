Mr. Ijaz Ahmad Toor, Advocate for appellant.  
 
 
  
MUZAMIL AKHTAR SHABIR, J:- Through this 
Intra Court Appeal filed under Section 19 of the 
Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003, the appellant has 
called in question order dated 28.03.2023 passed by 
learned Single Judge of this Court, whereby petition 
under Article 204 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, filed by the appellant for 
proceeding against the respondent for committing 
contempt of court for non-compliance of order dated 
05.12.2022 passed in W.P.No. 10448 of 2019, has 
been dismissed.  
2.  The grievance of the appellant is that through the 
afore-referred order dated 05.12.2022 while setting-
aside the previous order dated 21.06.2019 passed by 
the respondent/Chairman, Pakistan Atomic Energy 
Commission, by declaring the same as without lawful 
authority, the matter was remanded to the said 
respondent for decision of the same afresh, who 
instead of complying with the direction issued by the 
court and in contravention of said order has repeated 
the order earlier passed by him without treating the 
previous order as illegal and not sustainable, 

2 
 
 
 
              I.C.A.No.118 of 2023 
therefore, he is liable to be proceeded against for 
committing contempt of court for violating the order 
dated 05.12.2022 passed by this Court.  
3.  We have gone through the record and heard the 
arguments raised by the learned counsel for the 
appellant.  
4.  The appellant filed W.P.No. 10448 of 2019, 
which was decided along with W.P.No. 10444 of 
2019, in which the main order was passed. Through 
his petition, the appellant had called in question order 
dated 21.06.2019 passed by the respondent, whereby 
the respondent had refused to extend the appellant’s 
contract and had relieved him from service with 
immediate effect. The said Writ Petitions were 
disposed of vide order dated 05.12.2022 while issuing 
direction as under:- 
“4. Under the law, respondents are under legal 
obligation to give same treatment to petitioners 
as already given to similarly placed other 
employees, if their case is on same footing. 
However, the aspect of discrimination has not 
been kept in mind while passing the impugned 
orders, hence, the same do not conform to the 
provisions of Section 24-A of the General Clauses 
Act, 1897. 
5. In this view of the matter, the impugned orders 
in instant and connected petitions are declared to 
be illegal and without lawful authority. Office is 
directed to transmit copies of this as well as 
connected petitions, along with all the annexures, 
to respondent No. 2, with direction to look into 
the grievance of the petitioners, while treating the 
same as representations, and redress the same 
strictly in accordance with law as well as office 
order dated 22.08.2022, referred above, after 
hearing petitioners and all concerned, through 
speaking orders within a period of thirty days 
from the date of receipt of certified copy of this 
order. Till then, if petitioners are still in service, 
they shall not be disturbed.  
6. In view of above, all these writ petitions are 
disposed of accordingly.” 
 
5.  The claim of the appellant is that as order passed 
by the respondent dated 21.06.2019 had been declared 

3 
 
 
 
              I.C.A.No.118 of 2023 
as illegal and without lawful authority, therefore, the 
respondent should have extended the contract of the 
appellant but instead the respondent through the 
impugned order dated 21.02.2023 had again relieved 
the appellant from duty. The operative part of which 
is reproduced below:- 
“In pursuance of PAEC HQs OM No. LAD.23 
(1748)/19 dated 21-02-2023 and PAEC NMC-I OM 
of even number dated 21-02-2023 on the subject 
cited above. Mr. Muhammad Ali (PIN-68842, 
CNIC No. 32102-8929430-3) S/O Muhammad 
Jamil Arshad, Date Entry Operator (SPS-2) 
Contract (Cat-I), NMC-I is hereby relieved off from 
his duty with immediate effect with pending 
clearance.” 
  
The afore-referred order was not the only order 
passed on 21.02.2023 rather through an office 
memorandum of even date another order dated 
20.02.2023 was conveyed to the appellant as speaking 
order of the competent authority passed in compliance 
of direction issued by this Court vide order dated 
05.12.2022. The operative part of speaking order 
dated 20.02.2023 is reproduced below:- 
 
“9. So far as the other alleged cases are 
concerned, it is found after looking at the record 
that they were either appointed through fresh 
appointment by way of merit or their services 
were extended as per the policy prevailing at that 
time. However, this policy was abandoned in 
2015, which is before the appointment of 
petitioner. No employee, appointed under the 
Death Compensation Package, has been granted 
extension after 2015. Hence, no discrimination 
whatsoever has been meted out with the present 
petitioner. 
10. For the reasons stated above, I, being the 
Appellate Authority am satisfied that the case of 
the Petitioner is not covered under the rules/law 
on the subject. Accordingly, his representation is 
hereby dismissed through this order and the 
order dated 21.06.2019 is upheld as it does not 
suffer from any illegality. The contract of 
petitioner has already expired on 12.01.2018 and 
the injunctive order along with the instant Writ 

4 
 
 
 
              I.C.A.No.118 of 2023 
Petition has been disposed of, hence, the service 
contract of the petitioner stands terminated.” 
6.  The learned Single Judge of this Court vide order 
dated 05.12.2022 while allowing the Writ Petition No. 
10448 of 2019 had directed the respondents to 
reconsider the case of the appellant on the ground that 
the previous order dated 21.06.2019 was a non-
speaking order as the question of discrimination had 
not been considered and had not declared the said 
order to be absolutely void for all intents and 
purposes. The respondent after reconsidering the case 
of the appellant on various grounds including the 
ground of discrimination vide order dated 20.02.2023 
has declined the relief to the appellant and order of 
this Court to the extent of decision afresh while 
considering the question of discrimination has been 
complied with, therefore, there was no need to 
proceed further with the contempt of court petition 
filed by the appellant, which aspect of the matter has 
rightly been considered and the petition for contempt 
of court has rightly been dismissed by the learned 
Single Judge of this Court vide order dated 
28.03.2023 (impugned herein). The appellant has 
challenged the dismissal of his contempt of court 
petition by the learned Single Judge by claiming that 
previous order being void could not be repeated by the 
respondent but we do not find any illegality or 
jurisdictional defect arising in the matter on that 
account to interfere in the order passed by the learned 
Single Judge. 
7.  Even otherwise, where a court itself passed an 
order and refused to proceed with the contempt of 
court matter on the ground that there was no reason to 
proceed with the same, the appellate court does not 

5 
 
 
 
              I.C.A.No.118 of 2023 
ordinarily interfere in the order passed by the said 
court. The said principle has been laid down in 
judgments reported as 2021 CLC 1 (Muhammad 
Rafique and others versus M/s. Siddiqui and Company), 
and PLD 1979 SC 912 (West Pakistan Water and 
Power Development Authority through its Chairman 
versus 
Chairman, 
National 
Industrial 
Relations 
Commission). The relevant portion of latter reproduced 
in earlier judgment is as under:- 
“The matter of contempt is essentially between 
the Court and the contemnor. If the Court 
concerned for reasons of its own and in the 
exercise of its discretion does no feel inclined to 
take any action or for example accepts an 
apology in a given case, it is not for any other 
Court much less an appellate Court or authority 
to direct the said Court that it must proceed in 
the matter or to reject the apology. This is on the 
principle that the power to punish for contempt 
is to be exercised only by the High Court whose 
contempt has been committed and not by another 
Court.” 
8.  When confronted of the afore-said position, 
learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance 
on order dated 20.05.2022 passed in Civil Petition No. 
34-Q of 2019 (Abdul Baqi, etc versus Haji Khan 
Muhammad, etc) reported as PLD 2022 Supreme 
Court 546 to state that the afore-referred principle is 
not absolute principle of law and the appellate court 
may interfere in the matter if facts of the case so 
required. There is no cavil to the afore-referred 
principles of law enunciated by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court and this Court while hearing the Appeal can 
look into the matter to decide whether any contempt 
of court has been committed in view of the principles 
laid down in afore-referred judgment of the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan but the said judgment has 
also laid down certain principles for proceeding with 

6 
 
 
 
              I.C.A.No.118 of 2023 
contempt of court matter in appeal. The operative part 
is reproduced below:- 
“7. 
In the neighbouring jurisdiction also, 
their apex court has held in Midnapore People’s 
Cooperative Bank v. Chunilal Nanda, that in 
special circumstances, an order declining to 
initiate proceedings for contempt may be open to 
challenge before it, by seeking special leave to 
appeal under Article 136 of their Constitution, 
which is similar to Article 185(3) of Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 
(“Constitution”). Thus, while this Court does not 
ordinarily interfere with the order of a High 
Court, 
declining 
to 
initiate 
contempt 
proceedings, but where such order, particularly 
passed on a petition of an aggrieved party for 
civil contempt, is found to be arbitrary, perverse 
or against the settled principles of law, the same 
may be corrected by this Court in exercise of its 
jurisdiction 
under 
Article 
185(3) 
of 
the 
Constitution on a petition of the aggrieved party.  
8.  
It would also be pertinent to observe here 
that the ultimate jurisdiction of this Court under 
Article 185(3) of the Constitution to grant leave 
to appeal against any judgment, decree, order or 
sentence of a High Court is not circumscribed by 
any limitation by the Constitution. The principles 
governing the exercise of this jurisdiction are of 
self-restraint, settled by the Court itself, keeping 
in view the considerations of propriety and 
practice. This Court thus ordinarily exercises its 
jurisdiction 
under 
Article 
185(3) 
of 
the 
Constitution, and grants the leave to appeal, as 
held by a six-member larger bench of this Court 
in Noora v. State, in cases where some serious 
question of law is prima facie made out or some 
case of grave miscarriage of justice is 
established either by reason of the fact  that the 
findings sought to be impugned could not have 
been arrived at by any reasonable person or that 
the findings are so ridiculous, shocking or 
improbable that to uphold such a finding would 
amount to a travesty of justice. Therefore, only 
when the finding of a High Court refusing to 
initiate proceedings for civil contempt is 
arbitrary, perverse, ridiculous or improbable, 
can the same be interfered with by this Court in 
exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 185(3) 
of the Constitution .” 
(emphasis supplied) 

7 
 
 
 
              I.C.A.No.118 of 2023 
9.  The principle laid down in the afore-referred case 
is that the appellate court can interfere in an order 
passed in contempt of court petition refusing to 
initiate proceedings against the contemnor where 
some serious question of law is prima facie made out 
or some case of grave miscarriage of justice is 
established either by reason of the fact that the 
findings sought to be impugned could not have been 
arrived at by any reasonable person or that the 
findings are so ridiculous, shocking or improbable 
that to uphold such finding would amount to a 
travesty of justice. Therefore, only when the finding 
of a High Court refusing to initiate proceedings for 
civil contempt is arbitrary, perverse, ridiculous or 
improbable, can the same be interfered with by the 
appellate court.  
10.  In the present case, in the opinion of this Court as 
already mentioned above, the order passed by learned 
Single Judge dated 05.12.2022 has already been 
complied with by the respondent while passing order 
dated 20.02.2023 and the question that whether the 
said order passed by the respondent is based on 
correct determination of factual position or not is not a 
question that can be summarily determined in the 
contempt of court petition or proceeding arising 
therefrom as the same requires deeper probe into 
internal working of the respondent-department and 
determination of disputed facts. Besides the grounds 
for interfering in the matter in terms of principles laid 
down in the afore-referred judgment of the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court apparently do not exist in the matter in 
hand especially when the order passed by the 
respondent and the learned Single Judge prima facie 

8 
 
 
 
              I.C.A.No.118 of 2023 
appear to be based on proper appreciation of facts and 
conclusions reached by the said forums is not prima 
facie arbitrary, ridiculous, shocking or improbable. 
This Court would also not like to interfere in the 
matter for the reason that such interference may 
prejudice case of either of the parties if further remedy 
available under the law is pursued in the matter. 
Moreover, the appellant’s counsel when queried that 
whether the impugned order had been called in 
question through any proceedings, states that the 
appellant has already challenged the same by filing 
constitutional petition before this Court and in view 
thereof this Court does not find any reason to proceed 
further with the matter relating to contempt of court as 
the main relief of reinstatement in service sought by 
the appellant, if permissible under the law, could be 
granted in the proceeding arising out of afore-referred 
petition filed by the appellant and not through 
contempt of court proceedings or appeal arising 
therefrom.  
11.  For what has been discussed above, this Intra 
Court Appeal being devoid of any merit is dismissed 
in limine.
