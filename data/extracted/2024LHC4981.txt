JUDGMENT 
 
 
Date of Hearing: 
29.10.2024 
Petitioners by: 
Agha Abu-al-Hassan Arif, ASC.  
Respondents by: 
Mr. Safdar Ali Bhatti, Advocate for the 
Respondents No.1, 2, 7 and 9. 
Mr. Javaid Akhtar, Advocate with Arzoo 
Sarwat, Advocate for the Respondents 
No.3, 4 and 6.  
Nemo for the remaining Respondents. 
 
JAWAD HASSAN, J. The Petitioners through this writ 
Petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”) have impugned the orders dated 
30.03.2024 and 05.09.2024, passed by the learned Courts below, 
being illegal and unlawful.  
2. 
The brief facts of the case are that a suit for partition filed by 
the Respondents was decreed through a judgment and decree dated 
16.06.2021. This decision was subsequently challenged before the 
learned Appellate Court by way of an appeal which was allowed and 
the matter was remanded to the learned trial Court for a fresh 
decision. Upon remand, the learned trial Court again adjudicated the 
matter, which was once more challenged before the learned 
Appellate Court. The Appellate Court accepted the appeal and, for 

 
W.P. No.57227 of 2024

the second time, remanded the case to the learned trial Court for a 
fresh decision. Thereafter, internal auction proceedings were 
initiated and the impugned orders were passed. Hence, this Petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners Agha Abu-al-Hassan Arif, 
ASC  submitted that both the learned Courts below did not follow 
the procedure for internal auction as required under Sections 9 and 
10 of the Punjab Partition of Immoveable Property Act, 2012 (the 
"Act") and the same has been conducted in absence of the 
Petitioners. He further submitted that the Petitioners are widowed 
women who have been residing in their ancestral home for decades. 
The Respondents have purchased the shares of some co-sharers, and 
Respondent No.1, without paying anything to the co-sharers and are 
attempting to evict them from their home, which is illegal and 
unlawful. 
4. 
On the other hand, Mr. Safdar Ali Bhatti and Mr. Javed 
Akhtar, Advocate for the representing Respondents defended the 
impugned orders having been passed as per law. 
5. 
Heard. Record Perused.  
6. 
As the case revolves around internal auction of the property 
amongst co-sharers/co-owners, which purely falls within the ambit 
of Section 10 of the Act. For ready reference Section 10 ibid is 
reproduced as under: 
10.    Internal auction.– (1) If on the date fixed by the 
Court for the purpose, the co-owners fail to submit 
written agreement about the partition of the immovable 
property through appointment of a referee or the 
referee is of opinion that the property is not partible or 
the Court finds that the proposal of the referee is in 
contravention of any law, the Court shall determine the 
reserve price of the immovable property and direct sale 
of the property through internal auction on the next 
date of hearing. 
(2)  The Court shall require the co-owners to be present 
in person or through their authorized agents on the 
date of internal auction. 

 
W.P. No.57227 of 2024 
 
 
- 3 -
(3)  The internal auction shall be conducted in the 
Court and the Court shall maintain record of internal 
auction which shall form part of the suit. 
(4)  Any two or more co-owners of the immovable 
property may submit their written offers or counter 
written offers until one of them makes the highest 
written offer. 
(5)  The Court shall declare the highest bidder as 
auction purchaser in internal auction and direct the 
auction purchaser to deposit the auction price within 
fifteen days of the auction but the auction purchaser 
may deduct from the auction price to be deposited such 
amount as equals his share in the immovable property. 
         (6)  If the auction purchaser deposits the auction 
price under subsection (5) within the prescribed time, 
the Court shall confirm the sale, put the auction 
purchaser in possession of the property and distribute 
the auction price amongst the other co-owners 
according to their respective shares. 
         (7)  If the auction purchaser fails to deposit the 
auction price under subsection (5) within the 
prescribed time, the Court shall fix another date for 
internal auction but such auction purchaser shall not 
participate in the subsequent internal auctions. 
         (8)  The second or subsequent internal auction 
shall be held, as far as possible, in accordance with the 
procedure contained in this section for the first internal 
auction. 
 
7. 
Perusal of record reveals that the controversy started from the 
order dated 07.02.2024, wherein the trial Court observed that the 
Defendants are not interested to participate in the internal auction 
and in order to secure the rights of the Parties, one last opportunity 
was granted to both the Parties to appear in person to participate in 
the internal auction in light mandate of Section 10 of the “Act”. For 
ready reference the same is re-produced as under: 
“Learned counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that 
the plaintiffs are not interested in internal 
auction. The defendants are also not interested to 
participate in internal auction, however, in the 
interest of justice and to safeguard the valuable 
rights of the parties, absolute last opportunity is 

 
W.P. No.57227 of 2024 
 
 
- 4 -
granted to both the parties to appear in person to 
participate in internal auction in the light of 
section 10 of the Punjab Partition of Immoveable 
Property Act, 2012 for 17.02.2024.” 
 
  
Although the direction was passed qua the personal 
appearance of the Parties yet the order sheet is silent with respect to 
the fact that either on the said date learned counsel for any of the co-
owner/Defendant including the Petitioners was present in Court. In 
this backdrop the fact of issuance of direction appears to be having 
no legal consequences as it is silent as to whom it was addressed. In 
absence of this legal requirement the subsequent proceedings 
appears to be standing on the meek and mild foundations liable to be 
collapsed.  
8. 
Subsequently, learned trial Court passed the impugned order 
dated 30.03.2024, the following manner: 
“30.03.2024 
Present: 
Counsel for the plaintiff, Safdar Ali 
Bhatti, Advocate 
Counsel for the defendants No.1 & 
2, 
Mian 
Ali 
Raza 
Kamobh, 
Advocate.” 
 
Today, the case is fixed for the internal 
auction proceedings. The plaintiff No.1 & 
defendants No.1 & 2 alongwith their counsel are 
present. The proceedings of the internal auction 
have been made in the open court. Defendants 
No.1 and 2 submitted written bid by mentioning 
price of per Marla as Rs.25,50,000/-. The 
auction proceedings ended with the highest bid 
Rs.70,00,000/- per Marla price, offered by the 
plaintiff. Proceedings of the internal auction 
have been taken on the separate sheet and the 
same has been made part of the file. Now, 
plaintiff No.1 is directed to deposit the auction 
price after deducting his own share within fifteen 
days. Now, to come up for submission of auction 
price on 15.04.2024.” 
 

 
W.P. No.57227 of 2024

9. 
There is no denial of the fact that the “Act” is a procedural 
law which enunciates certain steps i.e. filing of the suit, summoning 
of Defendants, appearance of Defendants and filing of written 
statement within a stipulated period, ascertainment of mesne profit, 
determination of question of title, if any or share; appointment of 
referee for partition, internal auction, open auction and private 
settlement. While conducting proceedings it is incumbent upon the 
court of law to adhere to each and every step so that the requirement 
of law and justice should be complied with. One of the steps is 
“internal auction”, whose proceedings were not conducted in 
consonance with law by approval of all co-owners and parties as per 
Section 10(2) of the “Act”. It is settled principle of law that where a 
law requires to be done in a particular manner it should be done in 
that manner as anything done in conflict with command of law shall 
be unlawful and being prohibited. In this regard reliance is placed on 
the judgments reported as “Khalid Saeed versus Shamim Rizvan and 
others” (2003 SCMR 1505), “GOVERNMENT OF THE PUNJAB, 
FOOD DEPARTMENT through Secretary Food and another versus 
Messrs. UNITED SUGAR MILLS LIMITED and another” (2008 
SCMR 1148), “MUHAMMAD ANWAR and others versus Mst. 
ILYAS BEGUM and others” (PLD 2013 SC 255) and “GHULAM 
FAREED and another versus SHER REHMAN through LRs” (2016 
SCMR 862).  
10. 
From the language of Section 10(2) of the "Act” it 
unambiguously clears that the Court has to require all the co-owners 
to be present in person or through their authorized agents on the date 
of internal auction. The rationale behind the presence of all the co-
owners either personally or through their learned counsel is that 
opportunity of hearing is to be given to the parties so that the ends of 
justice may be procured. In absence of relevant stakeholders of the 
proceedings, jumping upon another step/procedure learned trial 

 
W.P. No.57227 of 2024 
 
 
- 6 -
Court has not only deprived the absentee co-owners from the 
opportunity of hearing but also violated the principle of fair trial. 
After insertion of Article 10-A of the “Constitution” in the list of 
“fundamental rights” it has become obligatory upon the Court to 
adhere to the procedural steps and to avoid from doing anything 
which caused prejudiced to the rights of the Parties. Article 10-A of 
the “Constitution” provides right of fair trial and due process for 
determination of rights and obligations. Because it is the ceremonial 
principle of law that the act of the Court should not cause prejudiced 
to the rights of the Parties, which finds its basis in old latin maxim 
Actus Curiae Neminem Gravabit. Reliance is paced on the judgment 
of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as “Faqir 
Muhammad versus Khursheed Bibi and others” (2024 SCMR 107), 
wherein it has been observed that:  
“Moreover, it is also a well settled elucidation of 
law that an inadvertent error or lapse on the part 
of Court may be reviewed in view of the 
renowned legal maxim “actus curiae neminem 
gravabit”, recognized by both local and foreign 
jurisdictions which articulates that no man 
should suffer because of the fault of the Court or 
that an act of the Court shall prejudice no one. 
This maxim is rooted in the notion of justice and 
is a benchmark for the administration of law and 
justice to ensure that justice has been done with 
strict adherence to the law and for undoing the 
wrong so that no injury should be caused by any 
act or omission of the Court.” 
 
  
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in another judgment reported 
as “Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Finance, Islamabad 
and another V. E-Movers (PVT.) Limited and another” (2022 
SCMR 1021) has observed that: 
“The due process requirement must be met in the 
determination of rights and obligations. The 
Constitution does not define due process. 
Therefore, it would not be appropriate to limit its 

 
W.P. No.57227 of 2024 
 
 
- 7 -
scope by defining it. But this does not mean that 
the due process requirement is a meaningless 
concept. Rather due process incorporates 
universally accepted standards of justice and is 
not dependent upon any law or laws. It is an all-
encompassing expression which may not be 
curtailed with reference to particular laws. Due 
process is to be understood holistically by 
keeping in mind the entire Constitution, which 
excludes arbitrary power, authoritarianism and 
autocratic rule.” 
 
  
In this regard further reliance is placed on “Muhammad Aslam 
(deceased) through LRs and another Versus Molvi Muhammad 
Ishaq (deceased) through LRs and others” (2024 SCMR 1390).  
11. 
From the above it is very much clear that the affecting person 
should not be condemned unheard and should be allowed 
opportunity of hearing in case any order is passed against him/her. 
This Court in the judgment reported as “MUHAMMAD ASLAM v. 
MEMBER (COLONIES) BOARD OF REVENUE PUNJAB LAHORE 
and others” (2019 C L C 1141), held that:  
10. The Latin maxim, 'Audi Alteram Partem' is the 
principle of natural justice where every person gets a 
chance of being heard. Audi alteram partem means 
'hear the other side', or 'no man should be condemned 
unheard' or 'both the sides must be heard before 
passing any order'. Meaning thereby the maxim itself 
says no person shall be condemned unheard. Hence, no 
case or judgment can be decided without listening to 
the point of another party. Natural justice means that 
justice should be given to both the parties in a just, fair 
and reasonable manner. Before the court, both the 
parties are equal and have an equal opportunity to 
represent them. Natural justice is the concept of 
common law which implies fairness, reasonableness, 
equality and equity. In our country, the principles of 
natural justice are the grounds of Article 10-A of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(the "Constitution") which Article enshrines that every 
person should be treated equally. The law and 
procedure must be of a fair, just and reasonable kind. 

 
W.P. No.57227 of 2024

The principle of natural justice comes into force when 
prejudice is caused to anyone in any administrative 
action. The principle of audi alteram partem is the 
basic concept of the principle of natural justice. This 
doctrine states the no one shall be condemned unheard. 
This ensures a fair hearing and fair justice to both the 
parties. Under this doctrine, both the parties have the 
right to speak. No decision can be declared without 
hearing both the parties. The aim of this principle is to 
give an opportunity to both the parties to defend 
themselves. No proposition can be more clearly 
established than that a man cannot incur the loss of 
liberty or property for an offence by a judicial 
proceeding until he has had a fair opportunity of 
answering the case against him. A party is not to suffer 
in person or in purse without an opportunity of being 
heard. This is the first principle of civilized 
jurisprudence and is accepted by laws of men. 
Generally, this maxim includes two elements: (A) 
Notice; and (B) Hearing.  
(A) Notice:  
Before any action is taken, the affected party must be 
given a notice to show cause against the proposed 
action and seek his explanation. It is a sine qua non of 
the right of fair hearing. Any order passed without 
giving notice is against the principles of natural justice 
and is void ab initio. Before taking any action, it is the 
right of the person to know the facts. Without knowing 
the facts of the case, no one can defend himself. The 
right to notice means the right of being known. The 
right to know the facts of the suit or case happens at the 
start of any hearing. Therefore, notice is a must to start 
a hearing. A notice must contain the time, place and 
date of hearing, jurisdiction under with the case is filed, 
the charges, and proposed action against the person. 
All these things should be included in a notice to make 
it proper and adequate. Whenever a statute makes it 
clear that a notice must be issued to the party and if no 
compliance or failure to give notice occurs, this makes 
the act void. Non-issue of the notice or any defective 
service of the notice do not affect the jurisdiction of the 
authority but violates the principle of natural justice.  
(B) Hearing: - Oral or Personal Hearing- How Far 
Necessary: 
The second ingredient of audi alteram partam (hear the 
other side) rule is the rule of hea ring. If the order is 

 
W.P. No.57227 of 2024 
 
 
- 9 -
passed by the authority without providing the 
reasonable opportunity of being heard to the person 
affected by it adversely will be invalid and must be set 
aside. The reasonable opportunity of hearing which is 
also well known as 'fair hearing' is an important 
ingredient of the audi alteram partem rule. This 
condition may be complied by the authority by 
providing written or oral hearing which is the 
discretion of the authority, unless the statue under 
which the action being taken by the authority provides 
otherwise. It is the duty of the authority who will ensure 
that the affected party may be given an opportunity of 
hearing. However, the above rule of fair hearing 
requires that the affected party should be given an 
opportunity to meet the case against him effectively.  
11. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the Bank 
of Punjab case supra in which this Court while relying 
upon the principles enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, has held as follows:  
"Such principle is applicable to judicial as 
well as non-judicial proceedings and 
executive acts and it has to be read into 
every statute subject to certain exceptions. 
If right of hearing has not been expressly 
provided in a statute, provisions of the 
Constitution can be put into service." 
 
  
Further reliance is placed on Muhammad Nasrullah Khan 
versus Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority through 
Chairman and others (PLD 2019 Lahore 486). 
12. 
It is also pertinent to mention here that Article 4 of the 
Constitution clearly states that it is inalienable right of every citizen 
including Petitioners to be treated in accordance with law by the 
Respondents and no action detrimental to the reputation, life, and 
liberty shall be taken except as per law. Article 4 of the Constitution 
is an established practice that is deep rooted in the custom and usage 
of law and, therefore, it cannot be overlooked and disregarded by 
any Court. It is held in judgment reported as Taj Wali Shah V. 
Bakhti Zaman (2019 SCMR 84) that “In fact, any right vested in a 
person to seek his remedy under the law should be liberally 

 
W.P. No.57227 of 2024 
 
 
- 10 -
construed, as this would bolster his recognized fundamental right of 
access to justice.”  A well settled principle is reiterated in case titled 
“SYED TAHIR HUSSAIN MEHMOODI and others Versus AGHA 
SYED LIAQAT ALI and others” [2014 SCMR 637] reading as 
follows:   
“to apply and to adhere to law is not a 
mere technicality, rather it is a duty cast 
upon the Court as per Article 4 of the 
Constitution”.   
 
13. 
It is observed that the learned trial Court has not adhered to 
the mandatory requirements of Section 10(2) of the “Act”, which 
necessitates the presence of co-owners in person or through their 
authorized agents during the internal auction proceedings. The 
internal auction process, as laid down in Section 10, was not 
followed properly, including the determination of the reserve price 
and the procedure of submitting offers by co-owners in accordance 
with law. Moreover, the Petitioner’s contention that the Respondents 
have failed to pay their share and have sought to evict the Petitioners 
from their ancestral property is a matter that requires careful 
consideration, as it involves the rights of vulnerable parties. 
14. 
What has been discussed above, this Court is of the view that 
the principles of Audi Alteram Partem and Actus Curiae Neminem 
Gravabit, as well as Articles 4 and 10-A of the “Constitution” are 
central to the present case. The maxim Audi Alteram Partem ensures 
that no party shall be condemned unheard, mandating that all parties 
affected by judicial proceedings must be given a fair opportunity to 
present their case, while Actus Curiae Neminem Gravabit dictates 
that no one should suffer as a result of a judicial error or omission. 
Article 10-A guarantees the right to a fair trial and due process, 
enshrined as a fundamental right, and Article 4 affirms that every 
citizen is to be treated in accordance with law, with no action taken 

 
W.P. No.57227 of 2024 
 
 
- 11 -
to their detriment except as per the law. In the instant case, the 
orders dated 07.02.2024 and 30.03.2024 passed by the learned trial 
Court are illegal and unlawful, having violated the procedural 
requirements under Section 10(2) of the “Act”. The failure to ensure 
the presence of all co-owners or their authorized agents during the 
internal auction proceedings, along with the absence of a properly 
determined reserve price and the lack of opportunity to submit 
written offers, has deprived the Petitioners of their constitutional 
right to a fair hearing and due process. These procedural 
irregularities not only undermine the legality of the orders but also 
violate the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, as 
emphasized by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in judgments (2024 
SCMR 107) and (2022 SCMR 1021), (mentioned supra) which 
stress adherence to the law to prevent injustice. 
15.  
When confronted, learned counsel for the Respondents 
submitted that the learned trial Court had conducted the internal 
auction proceedings in open court, and the highest bidder was 
directed to deposit the auction price, which he duly deposited. 
However, no satisfactory explanation was provided as to why the 
legal requirements under Section 10(2) of the “Act” were not 
followed, and the internal auction proceeded without the mandatory 
presence of all co-owners or their authorized agents/representatives.  
16. 
Furthermore, the Appellate Court, vide its order dated 
05.09.2024 (impugned herein), failed to properly apply its judicial 
mind to the facts and legal requirements of the case. It overlooked 
the serious procedural irregularities committed by the learned trial 
Court, thereby upholding an illegal and unlawful order in disregard 
of the principles of natural justice and settled law. 
17.  
In view of the above, it is crystal clear that the basic order 
dated 07.02.2024; and its subsequent orders dated 30.03.2024 and 
05.09.2024 (impugned herein), passed by the learned Courts below 

 
W.P. No.57227 of 2024 
 
 
- 12 -
were passed without complying with the mandatory procedural 
framework laid down in Section 10 of the “Act”. Accordingly, this 
writ petition is allowed, the impugned orders are set aside, and the 
case is remanded to the learned trial Court with the direction to 
conduct the internal auction afresh, strictly in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 10 of the “Act”, ensuring proper notice to all 
co-owners and adherence to the procedural steps outlined in the law.
