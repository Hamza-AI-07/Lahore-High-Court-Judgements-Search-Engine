This and connected constitutional petition 
bearing W.P No.13876/2024 manifest grievance 
arisen out of transfer orders of the petitioners, 
former petition relates to order of cancellation of 
transfer and latter is directed against the transfer 
effected. Transfer orders, being part of terms and 
conditions of service, are not interfered under 
constitutional jurisdiction, unless some element 
of 
apparent 
mala 
fide, 
vindictiveness 
or 
nefariousness is manifested. These cases are 
different, where the orders subject matter 
commonly traced their source in the Notification 
No.PS/SCM/CMO/24/OT47/ dated 01.03.2024 
(the 
‘Notification’), 
through 
which

-:2:- 
 
Chief Minister Punjab had imposed complete ban 
on all kinds of transfers / postings with 
immediate effect. Office of the Advocate General 
Punjab was put on notice to explain that under 
what authority of law blanket ban was imposed 
on transfers / postings of civil servants. This 
petition will only decide the question that 
whether exercise of authority by the Chief 
Minister, through issuance of Notification, is 
justiciable under and endorsed by any applicable 
law? 
2. 
Learned Law Officer submits that in terms 
of the constitutional mandate the executive 
authority of the province vests in the Chief 
Minister, who is otherwise empowered to extend 
approval to appointments, postings, promotions 
and transfers in terms of Rule 23 of the Punjab 
Government Rules of Business, 2011. Further 
law officer sought protection of section 9 of the 
Civil Servants Act, 1974.  
3. 
Heard. Rule 23 of Punjab Government Rules 
of Business, 2011 is not attracted, which relates 
to the appointments, postings, promotions and 
transfers to the posts in fourth schedule, thereof. 
Rule 23, ibid, speaks of approval and does not

authorize the Chief Minister to place complete 
ban on postings / transfers. Reference to section 9 
of the Civil Servants Act, 1974 is misplaced, 
which does not permit issuance of such 
Notification, placing ban comprehensively. It 
appears that Notification further creates an 
exception and permit transfers / postings, subject 
to circumstances stated therein existing, and 
approval of the Chief Minister. Notably subject 
posts are not covered under the fourth schedule 
of Punjab Government Rules of Business, 2011. 
  
It is appropriate to examine text of the 
Notification for clarity, which is reproduced 
hereunder, 
“SUBJECT: 
BAN 
ON 
POSTINGS/ 
TRANSFERS. 
 
Chief Minister Punjab is pleased to impose 
complete ban on all kinds of transfers/postings with 
immediate effect, till further orders.  
2. 
In case of any posting / transfer, which is 
required to be made on extreme hardship / 
compassionate or administrative grounds, prior 
approval will be sought from the Chief Minister 
through summary containing details of tenure of the 
officer and vacancy position, etc.” 
 
 
4. 
Executive authority so vested in the 
Government or Chief Minister is circumscribed 
by the law, to the extent legislated by the 
legislature. Chief Minister can exercise powers 
and perform functions within the limitations

W.P. No.13876/2024. 
 
-:4:- 
 
defined 
and 
contours 
prescribed 
through 
legislative fiat. There is no cavil that Postings 
and transfers are governed and regulated in terms 
of section 9 of the Civil Servants Act 1974 and 
rules framed thereunder, and according to the 
policy of the Government, unless aligned with 
the permissible limits, prescribed by law. 
Executive, by no stretch of imagination, could 
assume the role of the legislature(s), and proceed 
to legislate in garb of exercise of executive 
authority. If the legislature intends to extend 
powers to the Chief Minister to centralize and 
regulate postings and transfers of civil servants 
operating in the province, same may legislate and 
make requisite amends in relevant laws. No law / 
judicial precedent is cited that supports or 
endorses action of imposition of complete ban on 
all kinds of transfers / postings, which act of 
arbitrarily encompassing all power unto the Chief 
Minister is nothing but sheer abuse of executive 
authority. Text of the Notification manifest 
centralization 
of 
powers 
/ 
control 
and 
aggrandizement of authority, at the expense of 
subduing, 
effectively 
controlling 
and 
conspicuously undermining the independence 
and working of the civil servants / bureaucracy,

including Police department – in connected

petition 
Sub-Inspector 
was 
transferred while acting under the effect of 
Notification. Such an overreach by the executive 
authority tantamount to an obvious encroachment 
and otherwise disturbs administrative equilibrium 
of checks and balances. Notification, appears to 
be a remnant of colonial legacy. Nothing is 
placed on record to demonstrate that legal 
opinion was solicited from the principal law 
officer of the province, before introducing the 
Notification of 01.03.2024. Notification without 
the support of law has no authority or legal 
effect. Reliance is placed on the ratio settled in 
the case of “Pakistan Muslim League (N) 
through Khawaja Muhammad Asif, M.N.A and 
others Vs. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary Ministry of Interior and others” (PLD 
2007 Supreme Court 642), relevant portion reads 
as,  
26. It may not out of place to mention here that 
“There is no inherent power in the executive, except 
what has been vested in it by law, and that the law 
is the source of power and duty. The structure of the 
machinery of government, and the regulation of the 
powers and duties which belong to the different 
parts of this structure are defined by the law, which 
also prescribes, to some extent the mode in which 
these powers are to be exercised or those duties 
performed. From the all pervading presence of law, 
as the sole source of governmental powers and 
duties, there follows the consequence that the 
existence or nonexistence of a power or duty is, a

matter of law and not of fact, and so must be 
determined by reference to same enactment or 
reported case. Consequently there are no powers or 
duties inseparably annexed to the executive 
Government. It cannot be argued that a vague, 
indefinite and Writ Petition No. 15453/2024 Writ 
Petition No. 29024/2024. Writ Petition No. 
34713/2024. 9 wide power has keen vested in the 
executive to invade upon the proprietary rights of 
citizens and that such invasion .cannot be subjected 
to judicial scrutiny if it is claimed that it is a mere 
executive order. This is not the position in law. Any 
invasion upon the rights of citizens by anybody no 
matter whether by a private individual or by a 
public official or body, must be justified with 
reference to some law of the country. Therefore, 
executive action would necessarily have to be such 
that it could not possibly violate a Fundamental 
Right. The only power of the executive to take 
action would have to be derived from law and the 
law itself would not be able to confer upon the 
executive any power to deal with a citizen or other 
persons in Pakistan in contravention of a 
Fundamental Right. Functionaries of State, are to 
function strictly within the sphere allotted to them 
and in accordance with law. No Court or Authority 
is entitled to exercise power not vested in it and all 
citizens have an inalienable right to be treated in 
accordance with law. Therefore, an action of an 
Authority admitted to be derogatory to law and 
Constitution, is liable to be struck down.” 
 
 
Reference is made to the decision in the case 
of “Province of Punjab through its Home 
Secretary, and 3 others Vs. Gulzar Hassan, 
Advocate and 8 others” (PLD 1978 Lahore 
1298) 
“59. 
In view of the above observations of the 
Supreme Court, it is absolutely clear that no 
executive authority can take any executive action 
without the support of a valid law and any action 
taken in violation of the above rule can be struck 
down by the High Court under Article 199 of the 
Constitution as being without lawful authority.”

be misplaced and otherwise misconceived, when 
examined in the context of clause 7 of Article 
202A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan 1973 (‘Constitution of Pakistan 1973’), 
which provides mechanism for triggering of 
Article 202A of the Constitution of Pakistan,

membership of respective Provincial Assembly 
to give effect  to the provision of Article 202A.

In view of the above, these constitutional 
petitions are allowed only to the extent of 
holding / declaring the Notification dated 
01.03.2024 without lawful authority and of no 
legal effect. To avoid administrative disruption or 
disorder, any and all transfer orders made or 
cancelled, purportedly under the dictates of the 
Notification shall continue to hold field, unless 
affirmed, endorsed or cancelled by the authorities
