……………………………………………………. 
MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J:- Muhammad Sajid accused/ 
appellant being juvenile faced trial in case FIR No.353 dated 10.10.2020 
under sections 377/377-B PPC Police Station City B-Division,  
Chishtian District Bahawalnagar and on conclusion of trial, vide 
judgment dated 01.07.2021, learned Juvenile Court, convicted the 
appellant under section 377 PPC and sentenced him to ten years’ simple 
imprisonment along with fine Rs.10,000/-; in default whereof to undergo 
further two months’ simple imprisonment. The appellant was also 
convicted under section 377B PPC and sentenced for fourteen years’ 
simple imprisonment along with fine of Rs.10,00,000/-; in default 
whereof to undergo six months’ simple imprisonment. Both the 
sentences were ordered to run concurrently and benefit of section 382-B 
of Cr.P.C. was extended to him. The conviction and sentences have been 
questioned through the instant criminal appeal. 
2. 
Brief facts of the complaint (Exh.PB), a base for the registration 
of formal FIR (Exh.PD) shows that on 10.10.2020 at 5:00 p.m., when the 
complainant was returning to his house situated within the area of Canal 
Rest House, Chishtian; on hearing the noise of his child, he along with 
Muhammad Nasir and Muhammad Naeem Khan reached to the deserted  
and dilapidated quarter of Canal Rest House, saw the appellant while

committing sodomy with his son namely Muhammad Nouman Saleem 
who, on seeing the witnesses, ran away from the place of occurrence.  
3. 
After observing all codal formalities, report under section 173 of 
Cr.P.C. was sent to learned trial court, accused was charge sheeted to 
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried; upon which, 
prosecution examined Mehboob Manzoor 1123/C (PW.1), Ghulam 
Haider 129/HC (PW.2), Dr. Hafiz Muhammad Mudassar Haleem, who 
conducted potency test of accused/appellant (PW.3), complainant of the 
case namely Muhammad Saleem Anwar (PW.4), victim of the case 
Muhammad Nouman Saleem (PW.5), Muhammad Naeem Khan, eye-
witness (PW.6), Fazal Abbas, SI/I.O. (PW.7), Dr. Hafiz Humayun 
Rasool, M.O. (PW.8) who conducted medical examination of the victim 
and gave opinion about commission of sexual act and Saqib Hussain 
T/SI(PW.9). Learned ADPP after giving up Muhammad Nasir being 
unnecessary and tendering the report of DNA (Exh.PH/1-2), closed the 
prosecution evidence. On close of prosecution evidence, statement of 
accused under section 342 of Cr.P.C. was recorded, he did not opt for his 
statement under section 340(2) of Cr.P.C., however, produced Form-B 
of NADRA (Exh.DA) and School certificate (Exh.DB) in defence 
evidence.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
Learned counsel for the appellant though initiated the arguments 
but having foreseen the result, he turned to his alternate prayer that 
section 377 & 377-B PPC cannot be attracted simultaneously under the 
doctrine of merger and sentence under section 377 PPC is a harsh one; 
therefore, conviction and sentence u/s 377-B PPC may be set aside and 
he would not challenge the conviction under section 377 PPC but while 
referring the documents (Exh. DA & DB) prays that the petitioner is 
juvenile, first offender and is a student, therefore, his sentence under 
such section may kindly be reduced.  
6. 
Record shows that prosecution has established its case against the 
appellant through the ocular account which though has a little touch of 

Crl.A.No.301 of 2021.

support from the medical evidence yet positive report of PFSA proves 
the act of sodomy/unnatural lust and the learned trial court after proper 
and correct appreciation of the entire evidence has held the appellant to 
be guilty and no misreading or non-reading of evidence could be found 
to justify interference in the conviction of the appellant under section  
377 PPC, but so far as applicability of section 377-B PPC relating to 
offence of ‘Sexual abuse’ is concerned and the prayer of learned counsel 
for the appellant to apply principle of merger, it is necessary to thrash 
the true intent of legislator for enacting offence of ‘Sexual abuse’ and its 
applicability in the situation when major offence overlaps the minor 
offence.   
7. 
The rationale, object and circumstances that culminated into 
enacting the offence of ‘Sexual abuse’ took a rout when this Court while 
disposing of an appeal decided a case reported as “THE STATE versus 
ABDUL MALIK alias MALKOO” (PLD 2000 Lah 449); wherein this Court 
reproduced the following observation of the Special Court constituted 
under the Anti-terrorism Act 1997 in a case pertained to sexual abuse of 
a 7-year-old girl child: - 
The offence against the accused under Section 10 (4), Offence of Zina 
(Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance 1979 is not made out. As regards 
the offence under Section 7, Anti-terrorism Act 1997, no such case 
against the accused is made out from the facts and circumstances of the 
case. As regards contention of the learned D.D.A about the allegation of 
child molestation against the accused, the said offence is neither 
punishable in any Section of Pakistan Penal Code nor any amendment has 
been made to make that offence punishable under Offence of Zina 
(Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance 1979 and mere mentioning of the 
word child molestation in the Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 
does not make the case against the accused triable by this court. 
The Court further observed: 
As proponent of Islamic faith which lays special stress on the welfare of 
family and child, as a member of the United Nations and in accord with 
the afore-referred mandate, it is our religious, moral and constitutional 
duty to bring the required legislative and structural changes to honour our 
commitments to the rights of child and family. There is need to suitably 
amend the penal law with a view to make certain acts/wrong against the 
children punishable. There is need to create socio-economic institutions 
to fully realize the objectives of the International Convention. There is 
need to give a new and a fair deal to the child. 

Crl.A.No.301 of 2021.

The Court also observed that child molestation which is sometimes used 
as synonymous to child abuse is committed in the following forms: -  
i. physical beatings to a child or subjecting him to severe beating, burns, 
strangulation, or human bites;  
 
ii. neglecting a child by not providing the basic necessities of life 
including refusal or delay in providing food, clothing, shelter, medical 
care, education as well as abandonment and inadequate supervision; 
 
iii. emotional abuse including constant criticizing, belittling, insulting, 
rejecting and providing no love, support or guidance; and 
 
iv. sexual exploitation of a child, including rape, incest, fondling of the 
genitals, pornography, or exhibitionism.  
8.    It was also the demand of international community to legislate for 
children in order to prevent them from sexual abuse and other related 
exploitations as mentioned in “The United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child 1989” which Pakistan ratified in 1990; related articles 
contemplate and stipulate as under: - 
Article 19. 
1.   State Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, 
social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of 
physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent 
treatment, maltreatment or exploitation including sexual abuse, while in 
the care of parents, legal guardians or any other person who has the care 
of the child. 
2.   Such protective measures should, as appropriate, include effective 
procedures for the establishment of social programmes to provide 
necessary support for the child and for those who have the care of the 
child, as well as for other forms of prevention and for identification, 
reporting, referral, investigation, treatment and follow up of instances of 
child maltreatment described hereafter, and, as appropriate, for judicial 
involvement. 
   Article 33. 
State Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislative, 
administrative, social and educational measures, to protect children from 
the illicit use of narcotic drugs, and psychotropic substances as defined in 
the relevant international treaties, and to prevent the use of children in the 
illicit production and trafficking of such substances. 
Article 34. 
States Parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral 
measures to prevent- 
(a)   the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful 
sexual activity; 

Crl.A.No.301 of 2021. 
5
(b)   the exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful 
practices. 
(c)   the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and 
materials.  
Article 35. 
States Parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral 
measures to prevent the abduction, the sale of or traffic in children for 
any purpose or in any form. 
9.      Taking into consideration the above decision of this Court as well 
as the international demand, the Law and Justice Commission of 
Pakistan conducted a study and formulated a Report 42, for an addition 
of ‘Offence of Molestation’ to the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 which 
revealed in following terms; 1 
A perusal of our criminal statutes reveals that there was no specific law 
on the subject to meet various situations and acts of molestation. 
Some provisions of the PPC touch the subject only partially e.g.: 
(i)         S. 354.           Assault or criminal force to woman with intent 
to outrage her modesty. - Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any 
woman, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby 
outrage her modesty shall be punished with imprisonment of either 
description for a term which may extend to two years or with fine, or with 
both; 
  (ii)        S. 354-A.       Assault or use of criminal force to woman 
and stripping her of her clothes. - Whoever assaults or uses criminal 
force to any woman and stripes her of her clothes and, in that condition 
exposes her to the public view, shall be punished with death or with 
imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine; 
 (iii)       S. 366-A.       Procreation of minor girl. -            Whoever by 
any means whatsoever, induces any minor girl under the age of eighteen 
years to go from any place or to do any act with intent that such girl may 
be or knowing that it is likely that she will be forced to illicit intercourse 
with another person shall be punishable with imprisonment which may 
extend to ten years and with fine; and 
(iv)      S. 509.-          Word, gesture or act intended to insult the 
modesty of a woman.- Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any 
woman, utters any word, makes any sound  or gesture, or exhibits any 
object, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such 
gesture or object shall  be seen, by such woman or intrudes upon the 
privacy of such woman, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for 
a term which may extend to one year, or fine, or with both.

                The above provisions of law do not fully attract various other 
forms/acts of molestation as observed by the High Court, hence there was 
need to enact a specific law on the subject. This need was also highlighted 
in the report of National Workshop on Child Sexual Abuse and 
Exploitation in Pakistan, organized by the Lawyers for Human Rights and 
Legal Aid (LHRLA) in April 2000 at under the action aid programme of 
the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the 
Pacific (UNESCAP). The report states that, sexual abuse involves any 
violation of the rights of a child including severe forms i.e., rape or 
sodomy and also includes other activities of sexual nature that fall short 
of rape or sodomy e.g., acts, like fondling, stroking, exposure to adult 
genitalia, caressing, etc. The report further highlighted that the crucial 
difference between abuse and exploitation is that when a child is exposed 
to or abused for the purpose of monetary gain. So, the trafficking of 
children, sale for prostitution or any other purpose would categorize as 
exploitation. 
                In 1997, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the 
Pacific carried out a study on sexually exploited and abused children. The 
study was conducted with data and research from 12 countries in the 
South Asia Region including Pakistan. The purpose was to confirm the 
incidence of child sexual abuse and its redress in all provinces of the 
country and to follow a campaign of creating general awareness about 
this neglected issue. The study was carried on children under 18 and, was 
carried out by the National Commission for Child Welfare and 
Development (NCCWD) and the provinces were delegated to various 
N.G.Os working within the indigenous areas. This study uncovered child 
sexual abuse and exploitation to be one of the least acknowledged and 
most neglected area of development. The study revealed that there exists 
no monitoring bodies to investigate complaints on any level within the 
country and that there is a shocking lack of awareness as regards this 
issue. It was further stated that sexual abuse is a taboo subject, more so if 
girl child is the victims, and in some areas, such incidents are suppressed. 
Moreover, in many areas, child sexual abuse is accepted as normal and 
child sexual exploitation is also condoned in the name of tradition. The 
study goes on to state that girl children are married off, boys and girls 
sold into prostitution and surprisingly, despite being illegal, it is a very 
openly conducted vice. Certain localities and venues were found to be 
more renowned for such practices for example local hotels, parks, 
brothels, shops and transport depots. The effects of this accepted cultural 
trend on children’s physical and mental health were found to be more 
disturbing, with no knowledge of HIV testing or AIDS despite the 
thriving demand for unprotected sexual practice being the norm. The 
study identified certain factors as contributing to the exploitation and 
vulnerability of children including the prevalence of large-scale illiteracy 
and lack of education in both adults and children, which further 
deteriorate the situation. This study finally gives recommendations for 
devising a national strategy and plan of action to ensure the recovery and 
reintegration of the victims of this practice and taking preventive 
measures to eradicating this evil. 
               In an article published in the News dated 19 September 2001, it 
is mentioned that, child sexual abuse plays a vital role in deforming a 
society’s moral and emotional health. It is now scientifically proven that 
sexual abuse suffered during childhood causes significant harm to adult 
survivors of such abuse. In short child molestation should be 
acknowledged as not a domestic problem but a social problem.

              The recommendations of the Commission were sent to the 
Government for amending the Pakistan Penal Code as well as for taking 
required administrative measures, and through a draft Ordinance 
following amendment was proposed:- 
2. Insertion of Section 354-B, Act XLV of 1860.- In the Pakistan Penal 
Code 1860 (XLV of 1860), after Section 354-A, the following new 
Section shall be inserted, namely; - 
 354-B.  Molestation with sexual motive: - Whoever with sexual motive 
resorts to act of fondling, stroking, caressing, pornography, exhibitionism 
or inducing or intimidating any person, with or without his knowledge, to 
submit for such act, shall be punished with imprisonment of either 
description for a term which may extend to seven years or with fine or 
with both.  
          Legislature attended the above articles of The United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 and legislated different 
offences to save the children, by amending the Pakistan Penal Code, 
1860 in year 2016 which are like section 292-A ‘exposure to seduction’, 
section 292-B & 292-C, ‘Child pornography’, section 328-A, Cruelty to 
child’ section 369-A, ‘trafficking of human being’, section 377-A &  
377-B ‘Sexual abuse’. The subject of this case, ‘Sexual abuse’ was 
drafted in following manner; 
 
Section 377-A; Sexual Abuse; Whoever employs, uses, forces, 
persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any person to engage in, or assist 
any other person to engage in fondling, stroking, caressing, 
exhibitionism, voyeurism, or any obscene or sexually explicit conduct or 
simulation of such conduct either independently or in conjunction with 
other acts, with or without consent where the age of person is less than 
eighteen years, is said to commit the offence of sexual abuse. 
 
Such offence was later remained the subject of discussion in different 
cases reported as “MUHAMMAD SAJID alias SAJO Versus The STATE and 
others” [2022 P.Cr.LJ 151 (Lahore)],  “NAUMAN HUSSAIN Versus The 
STATE and another” [2022 MLD 958 (Islamabad)], “MUBEEN AHMAD 
Versus The STATE and another” (PLD 2021 Islamabad 431) and “Mst. 
MUMTAZ BIBI Versus QASIM and 4 others” (2022 PLD Islamabad 228). 
10.     The offence was primarily punishable with sentence of seven 
years’ imprisonment but later amended in a more stringent form with 
sentence of imprisonment up to 20 years, not less than 14 years with fine

of Rs. one million. The section 377-A PPC being definition clause of 
offence of ‘Sexual abuse’ contains more than one situation, but limit of 
sentence is same for all sort of acts mentioned therein. Proposing such 
sort of sentence was not the demand of international community nor a 
compulsion under a ratified United Nations Convention cited above, 
rather a wish of our legislative body which shows lack of proper study 
and care; otherwise, some countries under such covenant have proposed 
different types of offences with various forms of sentences. A 
comparative analysis of laws of some countries throws light as under;  
UK government legislated ‘Sexual Offences Act, 2003’ to cater to the 
situation which entails different punishments for different types of sexual 
activities like as under; 
Exposure; he intentionally exposes his genitals, and (b) he intends that 
someone will see them and be caused alarm or distress. 
Voyeurism; for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification, he observes 
another person doing a private act, and (b) he knows that the other person 
does not consent to being observed for his sexual gratification. He 
operates equipment with the intention of enabling another person to 
observe, for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification, a third person 
(B) doing a private act, and(b) he knows that B does not consent to his 
operating equipment with that intention.  
Other offences include ‘Causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage 
in sexual activity’. ‘Engaging in sexual activity in the presence of 
child’. ‘Causing a child to watch the sexual activity’. ‘Arranging or 
facilitating commission of a child sex offence’. ‘Inciting a child family 
member to engage in sexual activity’. 
All the acts differently defined in such Act are punishable with different 
sentences which are cited below; 
‘Exposure’ (Section-66), imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years. 
‘Voyeurism’ (Section-67), imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 
years. ‘Causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual 
activity’ (Section-8), imprisonment for life. ‘Engaging in sexual 
activity in the presence of child’ (Section-11), imprisonment for a term 
not exceeding 10 years. ‘Causing a child to watch the sexual activity’ 
(Section-12), imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years. 
‘Arranging or facilitating commission of a child sex offence’ (Section-
14), like sentence as for offence committed. ‘Inciting a child family 
member to engage in sexual activity’ (Section-26), if offender is above 
18, imprisonment for a term no exceeding 14 years; in any other case, 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years.  
     
Note; These sentences are on indictment, otherwise all above offences in 
summary trial is punishable for a term not exceeding 6 months or a fine 
not exceeding the statutory maximum or both;

In United States of America, CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 
envisage a chapter 109-A on ‘Sexual Abuse’ which deals with different 
situations; Section 2246 defines the terms ‘sexual act’ which means; 
(A) contact between the penis and the vulva or the penis and the anus, 
and for purposes of this subparagraph contact involving the penis 
occurs upon penetration, however slight; 
 
(B) contact between the mouth and the penis, the mouth and the vulva, 
or the mouth and the anus; 
 
(C) the penetration, however slight, of the anal or genital opening of 
another by a hand or finger or by any object, with an intent to abuse, 
humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of 
any person; or 
 
(D) the intentional touching, not through the clothing, of the genitalia of 
another person who has not attained the age of 16 years with an intent 
to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual 
desire of any person; 
 
likewise sexual contact means; 
 
the intentional touching, either directly or through the clothing, of the 
genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with 
an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the 
sexual desire of any person; 
  
Such acts are punishable with sentences which are reflected below;  
‘Section 2243. Sexual abuse of a minor, a ward, or an individual in 
Federal custody’, imprisonment for not more than 15 years. ‘Section 
2244. Abusive sexual contact’, different situations but imprisonment 
not more than three years; however, offences involving young children, 
twice the punishment for different abusive sexual contact mentioned in 
the section. 
The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (India) 
defines offences as ‘Sexual assault’ & ‘Aggravated sexual assault’ in 
following terms;  
Section-7; Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or 
breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or 
breast of such person or any other person, or does any other act with 
sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration is said 
to commit sexual assault. 
 
Aggravated sexual assault is a situation when sexual assault is committed 
in different situations as mentioned in section-9 by Police Officer, 
member of armed forces, public servant, management or staff of jail, 
hospital, educational or religious institution or gang sexual assault.  
It makes the ‘sexual assault’ and ‘aggravated sexual assault’ punishable 
as under; 

Crl.A.No.301 of 2021.

Section-8; Whoever, commits sexual assault, shall be punished with 
imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than 
three years but which may extend to five years, and shall also be liable to 
fine. 
Section-10; Whoever, commits aggravated sexual assault shall be punished 
with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less 
than five years but which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable 
to fine 
Penal Code of Turkey labels the offence as ‘Child Molestation’ and  
Sexual molestation covers the following acts; 
 
a) All kinds of sexual attempt against children who are under the age of 
fifteen or against those attained the age of fifteen but lack the ability to 
understand the legal consequences of such act, 
 
b) Sexual behaviours committed against other children by force, threat, 
fraud or another reason affecting the willpower. 
punishable as under; 
Any person who abuses a child sexually is sentenced to an imprisonment 
from eight years to fifteen years. If the said sexual abuse ceases at the 
level of sexual importunity, the term of imprisonment shall be from three 
years to eight years. 
If offence is committed by more persons, some relatives, tutor, instructor, 
custodial parents, at employment and in some other situations mentioned 
therein; sentence shall be increased by one half.  
In case of performance of sexual abuse by inserting an organ or 
instrument into a body, the offender is sentenced to a term of 
imprisonment no less than sixteen years. 
 
In case of vegetative state or death of a person as a result of the offense, 
the offender is sentenced to aggravated life imprisonment. 
 
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 through defines offence of ‘Sexual Abuse’

abuse shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a 
term which may extend to twenty years but shall not less than 14 years 
and liable to fine of rupees one million.

11.    The language, legislator applied to draft the offence of ‘Sexual 
abuse’ contains each and every thing in a boat for its omnibus sailing on 
all sorts of acts and that too without the definition of terms used for 
explaining such offences in one section of law which not only makes its 
applicability difficult but creates problems for investigators/ prosecutors 
and the courts to propose particular charge or to find out standards to 
evaluate the charge for appropriate sentences. While proposing sentence 
for all sorts of acts mentioned in the section, legislator has completely 
failed to attend the sentencing principles and purposes which can be like; 
Principles of sentencing 
• 
Parsimony – the sentence must be no more severe than is necessary 
to meet the purposes of sentencing. 
• 
Proportionality – the overall punishment must be proportionate to 
the gravity of the offending behaviour. 
• 
Parity – similar sentences should be imposed for similar offences 
committed by offenders in similar circumstances. 
• 
Totality – where an offender is to serve more than one sentence, the 
overall sentence must be just and appropriate in light of the overall 
offending behaviour. 
Purposes of sentencing  
• 
Just punishment – to punish the offender to an extent and in a way 
that is just in all the circumstances. 
• 
Deterrence – to deter the offender (specific deterrence) or other 
people (general deterrence) from committing offences of the same or a 
similar character. 
• 
Rehabilitation – to establish conditions that the court considers will 
enable the offender’s rehabilitation. 
• 
Denunciation – to denounce, condemn or censure the offending 
conduct. 
• 
Community protection – to protect the community from the 
offender. 
          The words used in section 377-A PPC for describing different 
types of offences require different sentencing zones to meet above 
principles and purposes of sentencing, but legislator has not taken care 
of such requirement which is causing serious prejudice, damage and 
injustice to oppressed people who are easy prey for false implication as 
scapegoat. So much so legislator has not defined the words ‘fondling, 
stroking, caressing, exhibitionism, voyeurism’ used in section              

Crl.A.No.301 of 2021. 
12
377-A PPC, therefore, its self-interpretation can produce inconsistent 
approaches to reach out for proof of such offence. However, what they 
stand for in its ordinary dictionary meanings reflect something like as 
below;  
Fondling: The touching of private body parts of another person for the 
purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, 
including instances where victim is incapable of giving consent because 
of his/her age or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental 
capacity. 
Stroking: to move a hand, on another part of body or an object gently 
over something or someone, usually repeatedly and for pleasure. 
Caressing: to touch or kiss someone in a gentle and loving way. 
Exhibitionism: involves exposing the genitals to become sexually 
excited or having a strong desire to be observed by other people during 
sexual activity.  
Voyeurism: is the act of gaining sexual pleasure through watching or 
recording someone in a private act. To fall under this offence, it must be 
non-consensual.  
These terms have also been defined like as under;

           In addition to above it is also mentioned in section 377-A PPC 
that any other obscene act shall also be included in the definition of 
sexual abuse. The above definitions clearly reflects that they cannot be 
offences of same gravity but all of them entail minimum sentence of 14 
years; therefore, do not cater to the requirement of sentencing for an 
offence in true sense. Thus, it can be termed as a bad piece of legislation, 
consequently a bad law, open to exploitation very easily.  
 
12.     This type of legislation give rise to consideration that in fact, it 
may be said that all newly-made statutes are at first merely nominal law, 
and it requires a further process of growth, adaptation to the actual 
conditions of society, and confirmation by tacit consent of the members

of the community, before they can attain the rank of essential law; 
however, instead of ripening gradually into essential law, such statutes 
are eliminated in the course of time by one of the three processes: repeal; 
obsolescence; and destructive interpretation by the courts. 
 
            In one German principality it became a proverb that "storms from 
the East and laws from Bayreuth last three days." And long before the 
days of imperial Rome even, Aristotle had said: " Law derives its 
authority from nothing but custom, and this grows only in the course of 
a long time, so that an easy changing from existing laws to different and 
new ones is to weaken the force of law." 
 
           An article “Some Neglected Factors in Law-Making” Authored 
by Ernest Bruncken; Source: The American Political Science Review, 
May, 1914, Vol. 8, No. 2 (May, 1914), pp. 222-237 Published by: 
American Political Science Association, has aptly throws light on 
requirement of law making with following expression; 
 
“Somewhere in the Corpus juris civilis I found the sentence: "Non ex 
regula jus sumatur, sed ex jure quod est regula fit-The law is not to be 
gathered from rules, but the rules grow out of the existing law." And the 
distinguished president of Yale, speaking of the true character of our 
constitution, puts a similar thought into a striking metaphor when he says: 
"A fence does not make a boundary-it marks it. The constitution is the 
evidence of a limitation, not the cause." Both sentences, the one referring 
to the body of the unwritten, the other to a written law, express the same 
idea: That the mere enactment of a statute, or the enunciation of a rule by 
a court, is not of itself sufficient to make law in any true sense. Of itself, 
it is merely what I should like to call nominal law. It will not be true or 
essential law until it has proven itself to be founded upon the sense of 
right generally prevailing in the community, or, to use the words of 
Isidore of Sevilla, until it is seen to be " secundum naturam, secundum 
contudinem patriae, loco temporique conveniens" "in accordance with 
human nature, in accordance with the settled habits of the people, fit for 
the place and the time." As long as it lacks these qualities, it may indeed 
be enforced for a while by courts and executive officers, but it is certain, 
within no distant period, to be repealed, to become disregarded and 
obsolete, or to be modified by judicial interpretation and construction 
until it has been brought into conformity with the requirements of 
essential law.” 
 
           We have experienced that Laws do not affect poor or rich alike, it 
has deteriorating effect on rich more than poor or on intellectuals than 
ordinary man; balance is the standpoint to raise or reduce harshness in 
penalties. The ideal would be, that all bills introduced and all statutes 
passed should be adapted perfectly to the common sense of right. 

Crl.A.No.301 of 2021. 
15
            Ernest Bruncken in cited article has well expressed that “I may 
be permitted to offer a bit of advice to those who dislike the activity of 
the courts in revising our nominal law. They might forestall the greater 
part of all this judicial work by promoting better work on the part of the 
legislatures. If all statutes, before being adopted, were skill- fully drawn 
by trained draughtsman; if the present anarchy in our legislative bodies 
could give way to responsible leadership, so as to make a consistent 
policy feasible at least within each legislative session; and if lawyers, 
and other men in positions of influence, had some knowledge of the 
theory of legislation, there would be very little need for censorship by 
the courts.” In the cited article it has been recommended as under; 
“The process of making law is not exclusively the work of legislative 
bodies, as the formal juridic theories would make us believe; nor even the 
work of the legislative combined with that of the judicatory organs of the 
state. The really determining factor is not the arbitrary will of individual 
men, nor even of groups of individual men acting consciously and with a 
deliberate purpose. The most important element in the entire process of 
law formation is that silent working of a million individual minds, each 
forming and expressing opinions, beliefs, feelings; setting up ideas, 
analyzing and judging the myriad facts and events of daily life; having all 
the time no conscious purpose of helping in any task of making laws, yet 
creating by their combined influence that environment which moulds the 
minds and shapes the purposes of those who at one time or other act in 
the capacity of legislators and judges. These silent forces have sometimes 
been called the folk-spirit, a term convenient and brief, yet one which will 
have to be used circumspectly by political scientists, on account of certain 
speculative and fanciful notions clustered around it. This folk-spirit is at 
work in the legislature as well as in the court, and the words applied to 
judicial decisions by an eminent American lawyer apply equally to the 
statutes: ".... these .... changes have usually been in accord with and due 
to the spirit of the age. The court really doing little more than registering 
the modifications of the national common consciousness. Hence these 
changes, in most cases, have passed unnoticed."  
 
13.     Law does not work properly if the punishments prescribed do not 
meet the standards which the jurists suggest depending upon the nature 
of offence and composition of society.  JEREMY BENTHAM expressed 
his view about the Punishments which ought not to be inflicted; 
according to him it may be reduced to four heads: when punishment 
would be—1st, Misapplied; 2nd, Inefficacious; 3rd, Superfluous; 4th, Too 
expensive. 
I. PUNISHMENTS MISAPPLIED. — Punishments are misapplied 
wherever there is a no real offence, no evil of the first order or of the 
second order; or where the evil is more than compensated by an attendant 

Crl.A.No.301 of 2021. 
16
good, as in the exercise of political or domestic authority, in the repulsion 
of a weightier evil, in self-defence, & c. 
          If the idea of what constitutes a real offence has been clearly 
apprehended, it will be easy to distinguish real from imaginary 
offences—from those acts, innocent in themselves, which have been 
arranged among offences by prejudice, antipathy, mistakes of 
government, the ascetic principle, in the same way that several 
wholesome kinds of food are considered among certain nations as 
poisonous or unclean. Heresy and witchcrafts are offences of this class. 
II. INEFFICACIOUS PUNISHMENTS. - I call those punishments 
inefficacious which have no power to produce an effect upon the will, and 
which, inconsequence, have no tendency towards the prevention of like 
acts. Punishments are inefficacious when directed against individuals 
who could not know the law, who have acted without intention, who have 
done the evil innocently, under an erroneous supposition, or by irresistible 
constraint. Children, imbeciles, idiots, though they may be influenced, to 
a certain extent, by rewards and threats, have not a sufficient idea of 
futurity to be restrained by punishments. In their case laws have no 
efficacy. 
If a man is determined to act by a fear superior to that of the 
heaviest legal punishment, or by the hope of a preponderant good, it is 
plain that the law can have little influence over him. We have seen laws 
against dueling disregarded, because men of honour are more afraid of 
shame than of punishment. Punishments directed against religious 
opinions generally fail to be effectual, because the idea of everlasting 
reward triumphs over the fear of death. According as these opinions have 
more or less influence, punishment in such cases, is more or less 
efficacious.  
III. SUPERFLUOUS PUNISHMENTS.-. Punishments are superfluous in 
cases where the same end may be obtained by means more mild--
instruction, example, invitations, delays, rewards. A man spreads abroad 
pernicious opinions: shall the magistrate therefore seize the sword and 
punish him? No; if it is the interest of one individual to give currency to 
bad maxims, it is the interest of a thousand others to refute him. 
IV. PUNISHMENTS TOO EXPENSIVE. - If the evil of the punishment 
exceeds the evil of the offence, the legislator will produce more suffering 
than he prevents. He will purchase exemption from a lesser evil at the 
expense of a greater evil. 
Two tables should be kept in view-- one representing the evil 
of offences, the other the evil of punishments. 

Crl.A.No.301 of 2021. 
17
JEREMY BENTHAM further says that the following evils are produced 
by every penal law:--  
1st. Evil of coercion. It imposes a privation more or less painful according 
to the degree of pleasure which the thing forbidden has the power of 
conferring. 2nd. The sufferings caused by the punishment, whenever it is 
actually carried into execution. 3rd. Evil of apprehension suffered by 
those who have violated the law or who fear a prosecution in 
consequence. 4th. Evil of false prosecutions. This inconvenience 
appertains to all penal laws, but particularly to laws which are obscure 
and to imaginary offences. A general antipathy often produces a frightful 
disposition to prosecute and to condemn upon Suspicions or appearances. 
5th. Derivative evil suffered by the parents or friends of those who are 
exposed to the rigour of the law. 
Such is the table of evils or of expenses which the legislator 
ought to consider every time he establishes a punishment. 
            He concluded that it is from this source that the principal reason 
is drawn for general amnesties, in case of those complicated offences 
which spring from a spirit of party. In such cases it may happen that the 
law envelopes a great multitude, sometimes half the total number of 
citizens, and perhaps more than half. Will you punish all the guilty? Will 
you only decimate them? In either case the evil of the punishment is 
greater than the evil of the offence. 
            If a delinquent is loved by the people, so that his punishment will 
cause national discontent; if he is protected by a foreign power whose 
good-will it is necessary to conciliate; if he is able to render the nation 
some extraordinary service; - in these particular cases the grant of pardon 
is founded upon a calculation of prudence. It is apprehended that 
punishment of the offence will cost society too dear.2  
 
14.     In our jurisdiction, the Supreme Court and the High Court have 
focused on the principles of legislation which ought to be applied while 
defining an offence and suggesting a punishment. Some observations of 
the Courts are reproduced cited in the following reported judgments: - 
 
“JAMAT-I-ISLAMI PAKISTAN through Syed Munawar Hassan, Secretary-General 
versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary, Law, Justice and 
Parliamentary Affairs” (PLD 2000 Supreme Court 111).

“12. It is well-settled that Statutes must be intelligibly expressed and 
reasonably definite and certain. An act of the Legislature to have the force 
and effect of law must be intelligibly express and statutes which are too 
vague to be intelligible are a nullity. Certainty being one of the prime 
requirements of a statutes, a statute in order to be valid must be definite 
and certain. Anticipated difficulty in application of its provisions affords 
no reason for declaring a statute invalid where it is not uncertain. 
Reasonable definiteness and certainty is required in statutes and 
reasonable certainty is sufficient. Reasonable precision, and not absolute 
precision or meticulous or mathematical exactitude, is required in the 
drafting of statutes, particularly as regards those dealing with social and 
economic problems.  
 
Clearly, the language of the statute and, in particular, statute creating an 
offence must be precise, definite and sufficiently objective so as to guard 
against an arbitrary and capricious action on the part of the State 
functionaries who are called upon to enforce the statute. It is well-settled 
that penal statutes contemplate notice to ordinary person of what is 
prohibited and what is not.” 
 
“GHULAM ABBAS NIAZI Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others” 
(PLD 2009 Supreme Court 866). 
 
“12. It is settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that while legislating 
a penal statute that aims at creating an offence, the legislature sets down 
the definition in such simplest possible manner of drafting that it is 
capable of being comprehended by ordinary persons, of what is 
prohibited and what is not. The word of a penal statute is always objective 
and not at all subjective. It has to be intelligibly expressed and reasonably 
defined. The interpretation of the definition of a crime is not, therefore, 
needed at all and becomes so needed only when language employed is 
ambiguous.  
 
“Ch. EHSAN SABRI Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary, 
Ministry of Law Justice, Human Rights and Parliamentary Affairs, Islamabad”  
[2002 PLC (C.S.) 113]. 
 
“The statutes which are penal in nature must be definite, clear and certain 
so as to guard against any arbitrary and capricious action against any 
person.” 
 
            The referred contents, in fact, are the forms of recommendations 
which are the eye opener for our legislator, and it is expected that a 
composite language used for defining offence of ‘Sexual abuse’ and its 
form of omnibus sentencing shall be reconsidered for a better way out.  
 
15.   Coming back to the case in hand, as far as the conviction and 
sentence under section 377-B PPC is concerned, the appellant was also 
charged for an offence under section 377 PPC and sentence provided 
thereunder has also been imposed upon the appellant for such offence, 
therefore, doing obscene acts, if any, during commission of offence of 

Crl.A.No.301 of 2021. 
19
sodomy/unnatural lust would definitely merge in that offence  and there 
was no legal mandate available to the learned trial court to have 
convicted the accused/appellant under section 377-B PPC for a lesser 
offence which is contrary to the provision of section 71 PPC because the 
graver offence would engulf the minor under the doctrine of merger, it 
is defined as under; 
“In criminal law, if a defendant commits a single act that simultaneously 
fulfills the definition of two separate offenses, merger will occur. This 
means that the lesser of the two offenses will drop out, and the accused 
will only be charged with the greater offense. This prevents double 
jeopardy problems from arising.” 
 Reliance in this respect is placed on the judgments referred hereunder: - 
“BASHIR AHMAD versus THE STATE” [1985 P.Cr.LJ 1516 
(Lahore)]. The learned trial Court has overlooked the provisions of 
section 307, PPC and has ordered two convictions in respect of the 
injuries to Muhammad Anwar P.W. This is not legally permitted. The 
graver offence would include the minor offence and, therefore, the 
conviction under section 326, P.P.C. is set aside.  
 
“LASHKAR and 3 others versus THE STATE” [ 1987 P.Cr.LJ 1034 
(Lahore)]. The learned trial Magistrate has chosen to convict Lashkar 
and Falak Sher of offences under section 363 and 366 of the Pakistan 
Penal Code. It is to be noticed that the offence under section 366 is an 
aggravated form of the offence under section 363 and by operation of 
section 71 of the Pakistan Penal Code, they could not be convicted in 
respect of both the offences. Since the offence under section 366 is a 
graver one I would set aside the conviction and sentences of these two 
appellants for the offence under section 363. There convictions under 
section 366 are maintained.  
 
“AHMAD DAUD-UL-HUSSAINI Versus THE STATE” (2008 SCMR 
111). The petitioner was tried for more than one offence emanating from 
the same transaction. Section 71 of the P.P.C. inter alia Mandates that 
where several acts of which one or more than one would be itself or 
themselves constitute an offence “the offender shall not be punished with 
a more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could award 
for any one of such offences”. 
 
“FIAZ MUHAMMAD Versus THE STATE” [1981 P.Cr.LJ 12 
(Karachi)]. The appellant had caused both grievous and simple 
injuries to Hussain Bux and the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Hyderabad has convicted the appellant under both sections 326 and 324, 
P.P.C. and separate sentences have been awarded. The trial Court was 
clearly in error in giving two separate convictions and sentences for 
injuries given to Hussain Bux. Under the law, in these circumstances, the 
appellant could have been convicted only under section 326, P.P.C. and 
given one sentence and not two convictions and two sentences. Section 
71, P.P.C. and the illustrations to this section leave no room for any doubt 
on this point. 
 
“ZAFAR IQBAL alias KALA Versus THE STATE” [2013 P.Cr.LJ 645 
(Lahore)]. So far as contention of learned counsel for the appellant qua 

Crl.A.No.301 of 2021. 
20
reduction in his sentence under sections 396 and 460, P.P.C. is 
concerned, admittedly both the offence under section 396, P.P.C., as well 
as offence under section 460, P.P.C., though are different but fall in the 
same definition.  
 
“KHALID IQBAL Versus THE STATE” [1991 P.Cr.LJ  443 
(Federal Shariat Court)]. According, we lay down a rule that as 
and when an offender is charged for transportation or possession of 
different narcotics at one and the same time during the same transaction 
and the transportation or possession of some narcotics is punishable with 
enhanced sentence the offender shall be liable to the punishment for a 
joint offence of narcotics to the maximum sentence provided for the 
transportation or possession of certain narcotics and the transportation 
and possession of intoxicant punishable with lesser sentence shall be 
accordingly merged into the major offence of transportation and 
possession of narcotics punishable with enhanced sentence.  
 
“MUHAMMAD SARFRAZ Versus THE STATE” [2009 YLR 1131 
(Lahore)]. A combined examination of section 71, P.P.C. and its 
illustration (a) and the case law, referred to above provides a basis to 
conclude that an assailant causing different kinds of hurts to a person 
falling within the ambit of different and separate penal provisions of law, 
however, during the course of same transaction cannot be convicted and 
sentenced for each and every hurt separately and simultaneously and will 
be liable for the major injury only. We, therefore, hold that the appellant 
is liable to only one punishment under section 337-F(ii), P.P.C. for the 
whole beating. Resultantly, the conviction and sentence under section 
337-F(i), P.P.C. imposed on the appellant by the learned trial Court is set 
aside being violative of section 71, P.P.C. and the same law discussed 
above.  
 
“KHALID ALAM Versus PROVINCE OF SINDH through Home 
Secretary Sindh and 5 others” [2022 P.Cr.LJ 1094 (Sindh)]. As to 
section 71, P.P.C., it unambiguously speaks of limit of punishment to be 
inflicted to an accused for having committed an offence made up of part 
constituting separate offences instead of punishing him for each such 
separate offence and would be attracted only for executing sentence for 
that offence when the accused has been convicted, which is not the 
situation in hand. 
 
“HAFIZUDDIN AND 2 OTHERS Versus THE STATE AND OTHERS” 
[1969 P.Cr.LJ 610 (Dacca)]. The learned Advocate for the 
petitioners has next contended that in view of the provisions of section 
71 of the Penal Code, separate sentences under sections 147 and 324 or 
325, P.P.C. for the offences or rioting and simple hurt or grievous hurt 
are bad in law. He wants to say that the common object alleged of the 
unlawful assembly being “to assault or cause hurt”, separate sentences 
for rioting and hurt simple or grievous is illegal and contrary to the 
provisions of section 71, P.P.C.  
 
16.    In the light of above discussion, the conviction and sentence of 
appellant u/s 377-B PPC is set aside and conviction u/s 377 PPC is 
upheld due to credible evidence of prosecution including positive report 
of PFSA. However, as regards the quantum of sentence, it has been 
observed that medical evidence does not show any bestiality on part of 

Crl.A.No.301 of 2021. 
21
the appellant because during medical examination doctor has observed 
the condition of victim like as under; 
“On further examination there are no marks of violence or any injury 
present on cheeks or neck. A small bruise present on the back of right 
elbow but no marks of violence was present around knees or between 
legs. No fluid or any mark present around hips or anal opening. Anal tone 
is normal.”  
 
            Further. admittedly, appellant is a juvenile and trial was 
conducted by the learned Juvenile Court, Chishtian District 
Bahawalnagar and the appellant, during trial, in order to prove the fact 
of juvenility has referred his birth certificate (Exh.DA) and school 
certificate (Exh.DB), therefore, keeping in mind that the appellant is 
juvenile, he is first offender and was student of class-9 at the time of 
commission of the offence, the sentence recorded under section 377 PPC 
is reduced to simple imprisonment for a period of two years with fine of  
Rs. 10,000/- (ten thousand rupees), in case of default in payment of fine, 
appellant would further undergo two months’ simple imprisonment. 
Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. is also extended. With above 
modification in sentence, this appeal is dismissed. Case property if any 
be disposed of in accordance with law. Record of learned trial court be 
sent back immediately.
