IN THE PUNJAB SUBORDINATE JUDICIARY 
SERVICE TRIBUNAL LAHORE 
 
Service Appeal No. 15 of 2023 
 
 
Syed Faizan e Rasool 
Versus 
The Lahore High Court, Lahore through its Registrar  
J U D G M E N T 
 
Date of hearing:     
  25.04.2024. 
Appellant by: 
 In person. 
 
Respondent by: 
Mr. Muhammad Nauman Sarwar, 
Advocate.   
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J. / CHAIRMAN:- 
Through instant appeal, appellant has challenged letter dated 
25.08.2023, issued by respondent, whereby his representation for 
permission to apply for a Master Degree in Law from a foreign 
university, was declined.  
2. 
The appellant, in person, submits that impugned direction to 
approach a local university for admission in LLM is not in 
consonance with declared policy of this Court. He further submits 
that appellant has been subjected to gross discrimination in the 
matter as his other colleagues have been granted such permissions. 
Adds that appellant’s submissions have not been dilated upon while 
deciding his representation. In support, he has placed reliance on 
Usman Ali Chhachhar v. Moula Bux Chachhar and others (2019 
SCMR 2043), Muhammad Amin Muhammad Bashir Limited v. 
Government of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Finance, 
Central Secretariat, Islamabad and others (2015 SCMR 630), Abid 
Hassan and others v. P.I.A.C. and others (2005 SCMR 25), 
Chairman, Regional Transport Authority, Rawalpindi v. Pakistan 
Mutual Insurance Company Limited, Rawalpindi (PLD 1991 
Supreme Court 14), Pakistan Medical and Dental Council through 
Authorized Representative v. Muhammad Junaid Alam and others 
(PLD 2019 Lahore 234), Ameer Afzal etc. v. Govt. of Punjab (NLR

Service Appeal No. 15 of 2023 
2016 Service 34) and Dr. Sikandar Ali v. Government College 
University, Lahore through Vice-Chancellor [2012 PLC (C.S.) 
1119].  
3. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent submits that 
appellant failed to provide reasons motivating him at this stage of 
service to get higher education from a foreign university and how 
the degree would play a pivotal role in his personal growth and add 
value to his job. He contends that the qualification / education i.e. 
Gender Sensitization, possessed by appellant and mentioned in the 
contents of his application / appeal, has no relevance with the duties 
and functions as a judicial officer. He argues that appellant’s 
representation was decided after providing reasonable opportunity of 
hearing and attending all the grounds raised by him. He contends 
that question of discrimination does not arise in view of peculiar 
facts and circumstances of this case.  
4. 
Heard. Available record perused. 
5. 
Earlier, appellant’s request for permission to apply for Fulbright 
Scholarship and Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship Program 2024 was 
not acceded to vide letter dated 04.05.2024, however the same is not 
assailed through this appeal. Presently, the matter of declining 
permission to apply for a Master’s Degree in Law from a Foreign 
University is before this Tribunal. Record shows that in response to 
appellant’s request, the respondent-department, vide letter dated 
14.06.2023, required appellant to justify his stance in the following 
manner:- 
a. 
to 
place 
on 
record 
his 
achievements 
at 
College/University/Local/National Level, in field of Law, prior 
to and after joining his service as Civil Judge, with 
documentary proofs in form of Certificates, Research 
work/papers, land-mark judgments etc. including distinctions 
he made during his trainings/courses at Federal/Punjab 
Judicial Academy(s), to support his keen interest in specific 
subjects for LLM from a foreign university. 
b. 
to submit that how much time he took to join his service as 
Civil Judge after his graduation in Law and what academic 
achievements he gained during that period specifically. 
c. 
to give reason(s) (at least three in number) that 
instigate/motivate him at this stage of service to get higher 
education from foreign university and how that particular 
degree will play a pivotal role in his personal growth and how 
his personal growth can add value in his work and ultimately 
to this institute. 

3 
Service Appeal No. 15 of 2023 
d. 
to indicate the name(s) of the local university(s), he 
approached and how his desired foreign work/syllabus 
University(s)'s course superior to course work/syllabus of 
those local universities. 
e. 
to state the tentative amounts of direct and indirect expenses 
involved for his foreign studies i.e. Tuition Fees, 
Accommodation expenses, Travelling expenses, meal 
expenses etc. and to pinpoint the sources, by which he 
intends to meet them all. 
6. 
The stance of respondent, inter-alia, is that appellant could not 
satisfy the competent authority in answering the questions put to him 
whereas appellant vehemently contends that he is equipped with 
plausible reasons and material to justify his request coupled with the 
argument of discriminatory treatment. We are not inclined to enter 
into factual aspects of the matter, rather intend to decide the matter 
on legal plane.  
7. 
As per law, grant of permission to apply for higher education 
and that too from a foreign university is not a rule of thumb for 
every judicial officer, and the same is also not backed by any 
express provisions of law or rules or policy instructions or prevalent 
practice and this legal position is not disputed by appellant. This 
matter pertains to discretion of the authority to be exercised in the 
light of attending facts and circumstances of each case, saddled with 
certain requirements / qualifications. In this case, the authority is not 
persuaded to exercise discretion for a number of reasons. The 
appellant, despite arguing the case at some length, could not 
convince us that the authority can be compelled to exercise the same 
in each and every case, especially when there is scarcity of Judicial 
Officers as compared to bulk of pending cases and in view of the 
prevalent policy of the authority circulated vide letter dated 
25.03.2024.  
8. 
In matters of grant of leave, it is well-settled that such 
discretion cannot be claimed as of right, but for seeking such relief 
the applicant must follow the proper procedure provided under the 
rules and he is not supposed to avail any kind of leave entirely in his 
discretion and choice in departure to the rules and service discipline.  
Reference can be made to Muhammad Ali  Bukhari  v Federation of 
Pakistan through Establishment Secretary, Islamabad and 2 others 
(2008 SCMR 214) and Allah Ditta v. Director of Education,

Service Appeal No. 15 of 2023 
Colleges, Bahawalpur Division, Bahawalpur and another [1992 
PLC (C.S.) 571] 
 
In Indian context, the Delhi High Court in the case reported as 
Anita Malik  v.  A.I.I.M.S. & another  [2006(129) DLT 136] observed 
that it is no doubt true that the rule talks of eligibility and enables the 
Government or the concerned employer to grant study leave if the 
employee desirous of such a facility, fulfills the conditions. However, 
the rule is not cast in imperative terms. It is only an enabling 
discretionary provision and necessarily has to be exercised having 
regard to the circumstances of the case. 
 
Furthermore, the High Court of Kerala  in P. Geetha v. Kerala 
Livestock Development Board Ltd. And another (2015(1) Ker L.J. 
494) while discussing the Kerala Livestock Development Board 
Limited Staff Rules & Regulations, 1993 opined that leave cannot be 
claimed as a matter of right, and that under exigent circumstances, the 
leave sanctioning authority has the discretion to refuse, postpone, 
curtail or revoke leave of any description and/or  to recall to duty any 
employee on leave. 
9. 
In view of the foregoing, we are not inclined to interfere in the 
impugned order. The case law, relied upon by appellant, is 
distinguishable and not applicable to the facts of this case.  
10. Resultantly, this appeal being devoid of any merit is dismissed. 
However, appellant may apply again for such permission at an 
appropriate stage.
