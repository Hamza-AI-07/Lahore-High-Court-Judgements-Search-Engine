JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
Date of hearing 
 
 
08-10-2024  
 
 
Appellant by: 
 
 
Rana Maqbool Hussain, 
learned Advocate. 
 
 
Respondent by: 
 
 
Mr. Summair Jabbar, Mr. 
Bilal Ahmad and Mr. Anser 
Jabbar, learned Advocates. 
 
 
 
Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:– The present Regular 
First Appeal is directed against judgment and decree 
dated 18.01.2017 passed by the learned Additional 
District Judge Sialkot, whereby, the suit of the appellant 
filed under Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (the ‘Code’) has been dismissed. 
2.   
Brief facts of the case are that the appellant 
filed suit No. 19 of 2016 dated 12.07.2006 (the ‘suit’) 
on the basis of promissory note dated 22.11.2003 (the 
‘promissory note’) seeking to recover Rs.500,000/- 
from the respondent. The leave was granted to the 
respondent to contest the suit, vide order dated 

        
      R.F.A. No. 92515 of 2017 
 
 
 
2 
28.04.2007. Thereafter, issues were framed on 
06.06.2007 which followed the process of producing 
evidence. Learned trial Court decreed the suit vide 
judgment and decree dated 14.12.2009. The same was 
assailed in regular first appeal No. 31 of 2010. On 
05.10.2015 this Court remanded the case and then the 
following issues were framed by the learned trial 
Court:- 
1. Whether the defendant obtained a loan of 
Rs.500,000/- from the plaintiff and executed 
promissory note dated 22.11.2003 in favour of 
the plaintiff? OPP 
2. If the above issue is proved, then whether the 
plaintiff is entitled to recover Rs.500,000/- 
from the defendant as prayed for? OPP 
3. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is false and 
baseless, therefore, defendant is entitled to 
recover compensatory cost U/S 35-A of CPC? 
OPD 
4. Relief. 
 
 
 
 
3.  
The appellant availed several opportunities to 
produce evidence but upon his failure to do the needful 
his right to produce evidence was closed. On 
18.01.2017 the learned trial Court proceeded to dismiss 
the suit. Being aggrieved from the same, the present 
appeal has been instituted.  
4.    
Rana Maqbool Hussain, learned counsel for 
the appellant, has submitted that it was incumbent upon 
the learned trial Court to discuss the evidence led by the 
parties prior to the order of remand; that if the same is 
considered, the result could be different. He further 
submitted that the learned trial Court has acted in   
haste while closing the right of the appellant and he 
relied upon case titled “Hasham Khan and others 

        
      R.F.A. No. 92515 of 2017 
 
 
 
3 
versus Haroon ur Rashid and others”1.  
5.  
Mr. Summair Jabbar, learned counsel for the 
respondent has vehemently opposed the appeal and in 
course of his arguments he relied upon several 
judgments including in the cases Duniya Gul2, Moon 
Enterprises CNG Station3, Rana Tanveer Khan4, Syed 
Tahir Hussain Mehmoodi5, Atta Elahi6 and Abdul 
Ghaffar7. 
6.  
Heard. 
7.  
The following two questions have emerged 
from the arguments of the learned counsel for the 
parties:- 
 
(i)  
If the learned trial Court fell to error 
while not discussing or considering the 
evidence adduced by the parties prior to 
the order of remand dated 05.10.2015? 
and 
 
(ii) Whether the learned trial Court has 
failed to consider the facts of the case by 
applying correct law?  
8.  
It is well settled principle that on remand the 
learned Court trying the suit has to regulate the 
proceedings or proceed with the case in terms of order 
of remand passed by the higher Court as settled in 
Jameel Ahmed8 case. Attempt to sidetrack issue or 
decision in a manner, not directed by Higher Court, can

2 “Duniya Gul and another versus Niaz Muhammad and others” (PLD 2024 Supreme 
Court 672) 
3 “Moon Enterprises CNG Station, Rawalpindi versus Sui Northern Gas Pipelines 
Limited through General Manager, Rawalpindi and another”(2020 SCMR 300) 
4 “Rana Tanveer Khan versus Naseer-ud-Din and others” (2015 SCMR 1401) 
5 “Syed Tahir Hussain Mehmoodi and others versus Agha Syed Liaqat Ali and others”

6 “Atta Elahi versus Allah Bachaya and others” (2024 CLC 29) 
7 “Abdul Ghaffar versus Hafiz Atta ur Rehman and another” (2022 YLR 2174) 
8 “Jameel Ahmed versus Saifuddin” (PLD 1994 Supreme Court 501)

result into defiance of remand order9. In order to 
correctly appreciate the argument as to the first question 
reproduced above, it is now appropriate to reproduce 
the relevant part of order of remand passed in R.F.A. 
No. 31 of 2010. Paragraph Nos. 3 and 4 reads as under:- 
“3.   In view of the above, the impugned 
judgment dated 14.12.2009 in Civil 
Appeal No. 06 of 2006 titled Shahid 
Hussain versus Abdul Jabbar Tassadaq 
passed by learned Additional District 
Judge, Sialkot is set aside. The matter is 
remanded back to the learned trial 
Court i.e. learned District Judge, Sialkot 
where the parties, who are being 
represented 
through 
their 
learned 
counsel, will appear on 19.10.2015 and 
the 
learned 
District 
Judge, 
after 
requisitioning the record, either himself 
hear the matter or entrust it to some 
other court of competent jurisdiction to 
try the suit afresh after putting the onus 
of proving execution and signing of 
promissory note on the plaintiff of the 
suit and also after referring the matter 
to the finger expert as also hand writing 
expert in order to verify signatures / 
thumb impressions of the defendant 
shown to have been put on promissory 
note with his admitted thumb marks and 
signatures.  
4. The suit was filed in the year 2006 
and it would be appreciated if after 
19.10.2015, the first date of hearing of 
the parties in post remand proceedings 
before the learned District Judge, the 
matter will be finally concluded within 
next six months…” 
  
 
 
  (Underlining is added) 
 
9.  
A reading of above order reflects that the 
learned trial Court is ordered to try the suit after placing 
 
9 “Masood Rahim and 7 others versus Abdul Majeed and 9 others” (2009 MLD 106) 
 

        
      R.F.A. No. 92515 of 2017 
 
 
 
5 
onus of proving of execution and signing of the 
promissory note by the respondent and also to refer the 
matter to verify the signatures / thumb impressions on 
the promissory note. Para No. 4 of the above order 
reveals that post remand proceedings were directed to 
be completed within stipulated time. It is not the case 
that the learned trial Court was directed to merely frame 
the “issue” or “issues” and then return the findings to 
this Court. There is no direction in the order of remand 
to return matter after recording the evidence. The case 
visibly is not covered under Order XLI Rule 25 of the 
Code. This Court remanded the matter as a whole 
which falls within the scope of Order XLI Rule 23 of 
the Code, which provides …order to the Court from 
whose decree the appeal is preferred, with directions to 
re-admit the suit under its original number in the 
register of civil suits, and proceed to determine the suit; 
and evidence (if any) recorded during the original trial 
shall, subject to all just exceptions, be evidence during 
the trial after remand. 
10.  
Perusal of Order XLI Rule 23 of the Code 
does not reflect if the legislature has envisaged to 
discard the pre-remand evidence altogether. It says the 
evidence recorded during the trial shall be the evidence 
after remand, which is subject to all just exceptions. 
The case has to be re-admitted by the learned trial Court 
on the number allocated to it originally in the register. 
A similar question was considered by the Supreme 
Court of India in United Bank of India10 case and in 
paragraph No. 16 of the judgment it was observed that 
 
10 “United Bank of India, Calcutta versus Abhijit Tea Co. Pvt. Ltd. and others” (AIR 
2000 Supreme Court 2957) 

        
      R.F.A. No. 92515 of 2017 
 
 
 
6 
any evidence if already recorded would be evidence in 
remanded suit. The said paragraph reads as under:-  
“16.  But, it is now well settled that an order 
of remand by the appellate Court to the trial 
Court which had disposed of the t suit revives 
the suit in full except as to matters, if any 
decided finally by the appellate H Court. 
Once the suit is revived, it must, in the eye of 
the law, be deemed to be pending from the 
beginning when it was instituted. The 
judgment disposing of the suit passed by the 
single Judge which is set aside gets effaced 
altogether and the continuity of the suit in the 
trial Court is restored, as a matter of law. The 
suit cannot be treated as one freshly 
instituted on the date of the remand order. 
Otherwise serious questions as to limitation 
would arise. In fact, if any evidence was 
recorded before its earlier disposal, it would 
be evidence in the remanded suit and if any 
interlocutory orders were passed earlier, they 
would revive. In the case of a remand, it is as 
if the suit was never disposed of (subject to 
any adjudication which has become final, in 
the appellate judgment). The position could 
have been different if the appeal was disposed 
of once and for all and the suit was not 
remanded.”  
 
  
 
 
     (Emphasis Supplied) 
  
A contention of the learned counsel who 
sought to challenge the vires of a judgment on the point 
that the same is based on evidence recorded prior to 
remand order was repelled by this Court in Noor and 
other11 case.  
11.  
The matter essentially is one of interpretation 
of the order of remand and in my reading of this order 
the learned Judge deciding appeal No. 31 of 2010 has 
never intended that pre-remand evidence should be 
discarded in totality rather order was passed to place the 
 
11 “Noor and others versus Mst. Sattan through Legal Representatives and others” 
(PLD 2013 Lahore 30) 

        
      R.F.A. No. 92515 of 2017 
 
 
 
7 
onus on plaintiff and with the direction to take 
assistance of expert. Upon receipt of the same the 
learned Judge who received the file correctly perceived 
the order of remand when after framing the issues, by 
placing the burden on appellant as ordered by this 
Court, the parties were directed to get recorded the 
additional evidence. This order dated 06.01.2016 reads 
as under:- 
 
“…No other issue sought. Now to come up for 
recording additional evidence of the plaintiff, 
if any, on 11.01.2016...” 
  
However, the learned Judge passing the final 
judgment has not considered the pre-remand evidence. 
12.  
Now coming to another aspect of the 
argument regarding closing the evidence of the 
plaintiff. In this regard learned counsel for the appellant 
relied on Hasham Khan and others case (supra) and 
stated that even in case of failure of party to comply 
with order to produce evidence, the Court can ask the 
failing party to record its statement and then to proceed 
with the matter. There is no dispute as to this settled 
law but the record reflects that while closing right to 
produce evidence or invoking penal provision of Order 
XVII Rule 3 of the Code no violation of settled law has 
taken place. Reading of record as well as the judgment 
assailed before this Court reflects that plaintiff was 
directed to record his statement but he remained 
reluctant and attempted to seek an adjournment. This 
fact is recorded in the impugned judgment in the 
following words:-  
 
“…Plaintiff was directed to record his own 
statement but he was reluctant. By such right 

        
      R.F.A. No. 92515 of 2017 
 
 
 
8 
of plaintiff to adduce evidence was closed 
U/O XVII Rule 3 of CPC...” 
The reference made by the learned counsel for the 
appellant to Hasham Khan and others case (supra), 
therefore, is misplaced. 
13.  
Rana Maqbool Hussain, learned counsel for 
the appellant then sought an order of remand. I am not 
inclined to do the same. The entire evidence and the 
material is before this Court and keeping in view the 
fact that the promissory note pertains to the year 2003 
and the suit was instituted eighteen years ago, another 
order of remand will serve no purpose but adding to the 
agony of the litigants. Since I am of the opinion that 
right to produce evidence was rightly closed, therefore, 
I would like to give my findings, keeping in view the 
language of the order of remand and the law already 
settled and discussed above that the learned trial Court 
was supposed to stay within the scope of order of 
remand. 
14.  
In pursuance to the order of remand the matter 
was referred to Finger Print Bureau, Punjab for 
comparison of thumb impressions, which reaches to the 
conclusion that impression marked on the promissory 
note is dim and is not enough to permit the comparison. 
Thereafter, vide order dated 13.01.2016 the case was 
sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Home 
Department, Government of the Punjab, after accepting 
the objections of the plaintiff for ascertaining expert 
evidence as to the signatures of the plaintiff. The report 
dated 23.09.2016 is part of the record, which has the 
following conclusion:-  

        
      R.F.A. No. 92515 of 2017 
 
 
 
9 
 
“…After careful examination and comparison 
of original Questioned Signatures of Abdul 
Jabbar 
Tasaduq 
on 
Original 
Questioned 
Promissory Note dated 22-11-2003 (item no. 03) 
with routine signature of Abdul Jabbar Tasaduq 
on photocopy of CNIC (item no. 04) and with 
original dictated signature exemplars of Abdul 
Jabbar Tasaduq (item no. 05 & 06), it is 
concluded that Questioned Signatures on 
original Questioned Promissory Note dated 22-
11-2003 (item no. 03) are not done by Abdul 
Jabbar Tasaduq. Hence, Abdul Jabbar Tasaduq 
is not the author of original Questioned 
Signatures on Original Questioned Promissory 
Note dated 22-11-2003 (item no. 03)…” 
 
 
  
 
 
     (Emphasis Supplied) 
15.  
After receipt of the report adjournment was 
sought on 05.10.2016. The case was then fixed for 
13.10.2016 when the evidence of the appellant was not 
present. On 28.10.2016 the Court found that the 
evidence of the appellant once again is not present and 
another adjournment was given with the clear warning 
that no further opportunity will be granted. Same 
remained the position on 10.11.2016. This continued 
for some dates of hearing and then the case was fixed 
on 05.01.2017 when another warning was given. On 
07.01.2017 the case was adjourned because the learned 
counsel for the appellant was on general adjournment. 
The warning was repeated and the case was then fixed 
for 18.01.2017 when the following order was passed:-  
 
“18.01.2017  
 
Present:  Plaintiff present in person. 
 
 
  
Counsel for defendant present. 
 
 
  
Plaintiff seeks adjournment. 
  
  
This is suit for recovery under Order 
XXXVII CPC. 
 
  
This 
suit 
was 
instituted 
on 
12.07.2006. Earlier it was dismissed by the 

        
      R.F.A. No. 92515 of 2017 
 
 
 
10 
predecessor of this court vide judgment dated 
14.12.2009. However, the Honourable High 
court vide judgment dated 05.10.2015, 
remanded the case for its decision afresh after 
putting the onus of proving execution and 
signing of promissory note on the plaintiff. 
Thereafter the learned predecessor of this 
court re-casted the issues on 06.01.2016 and 
directed the appellant to adduce evidence. 
Since then the file is coming up for evidence 
of 
plaintiff. 
Plaintiff 
was 
given 
last 
opportunity 
for 
10.11.2016, 
then 
for 
7.01.2017 and lastly for today i.e 18.01.2017. 
Today plaintiff has no evidence. He was 
directed to record his own statement but he is 
reluctant 
to 
have 
adjournment. 
Since 
warning of last opportunity has already been 
given any further indulgence will amount to 
abuse of process of court. Accordingly right 
of plaintiff to adduce is hereby closed U/O 17 
Rule 3 CPC and through separate judgment, 
suit is dismissed....”  
16.  
In pursuance to the order of remand expert 
evidence was sought which went against the interest of 
the plaintiff. It looks that after knowing the same the 
plaintiff 
started 
adopting 
delaying tactics. 
The 
respondent categorically denied execution of the 
promissory note; his thumb impression or signing the 
same. This remained his stance in his written statement 
as well as examination-in-chief when he appeared as 
DW-1. He deposed in his examination-in-chief that 
false suit has been filed because in some other case he 
was appointed as referee against the interest of the 
appellant. The question was put to him as to why he has 
not lodged any criminal proceeding against the 
appellant which was convincingly answered by 
deposing that he gained knowledge of fake promissory 
note at belated stage. He denied the suggestion that he 
has given his thumb impressions or signatures on the 

        
      R.F.A. No. 92515 of 2017 
 
 
 
11 
promissory note.  
17.  
The scope of remand was to place the burden 
on the appellant (plaintiff) to prove the execution of the 
promissory note and soliciting the expert evidence. I 
have gone through the entire pre-remand evidence as 
well as the post remand record and I have reached to 
the firm opinion that the appellant has failed to 
discharge the burden.  
18.  
The remand order was passed giving six 
months’ time to complete the process of post remand 
proceedings. The appellant (plaintiff) delayed the 
matter for about fifteen (15) months, thus, neither any 
leniency can be shown nor appellant remained able to 
prove his case. This appeal is, therefore, dismissed with 
costs of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty-five thousand  
only).
