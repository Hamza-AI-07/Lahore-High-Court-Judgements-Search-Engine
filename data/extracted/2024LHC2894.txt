JAWAD HASSAN, J. M/s AG Signs (Pvt.) Ltd. (the 
“Petitioner”) has filed this Civil Revision under Section 115 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (the “CPC”) challenging 
judgment and decree dated 11.03.2017 whereby learned Additional 
District Judge, Rawalpindi, while dismissing its appeal upheld the 
judgment and decree dated 23.01.2013 passed by learned Civil Judge 
Rawalpindi. Besides, the “Petitioner” has also challenged order dated 
15.01.2013, whereby his right to produce evidence was closed. 
I. 
BRIEF 
2. 
The background of the present controversy is that Gashoo 
Advertiser (the “Respondent”) filed a suit for recovery of 
Rs.1,06,45,000/- on 17.07.2008 against the “Petitioner” who stormily 
contested it by filing a written statement on 06.04.2009 before the trial 
Court. The issues were framed by the trial Court vide order dated 
08.02.2010 and the case was fixed for the evidence of “Respondent” 
which was completed on 05.11.2012 and later the case was adjourned 
for evidence of the “Petitioner”. However, despite availing numerous 
opportunities to produce evidence, the “Petitioner” remained failed 
and the trial Court vide its order dated 15.01.2013 closed the 
Petitioner’s right to produce evidence and fixed the case for final 
arguments on 17.01.2023. Ultimately the suit was decreed partially 

Civil Revision No.449/D of 2017

vide judgment and decree dated 23.01.2013. Being dissatisfied, the 
“Petitioner” filed appeal before the Additional District Judge, 
Rawalpindi which was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 
17.03.2017. Hence this petition.  
II. 
SUBMISSIONS OF THE PETITIONER 
3. 
Barrister Talha Ilyas Sheikh, counsel for the “Petitioner” has 
inter alia argued that before closing the right of evidence, the trial 
Court was required to provide ample opportunities as afforded to the 
“Respondent”; that judgments and decrees of both the Courts below 
are the result of gross mis-reading and non-reading of evidence; that 
by closing the evidence of the “Petitioner”, the Courts below have 
denied the substantial rights to the “Petitioner” on the basis of 
technicalities. He has relied on “HASHAM KHAN and others versus 
HAROON UR RASHID and others” (2022 SCMR 1793), “Sheikh 
KHURSHID MEHBOOB ALAM versus Mirza HASHIM BAIG and 
another” (2012 SCMR 361), “HAMIDULLAH KHAN and another 
versus Ch. MUHAMMAD JAMEEL and others” (2003 SCMR 995), 
“MUHAMMAD YAQOOB and others versus RAHEELA YOUSAFL 
and others” (2024 CLC 49), “SOHAIL NIAZ GILL versus SENIOR 
CIVIL JUDGE, ISLAMABAD and others” (2023 MLD 708) and 
“Messrs IJAZ NIZAM versus NIB BANK and others” (2017 CLD 
361).  
III. 
SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENT 
4. 
Conversely, Ms. Elysee Nazir, Advocate counsel for the 
“Respondent” supported the impugned judgments and decrees and, 
while resisting the instant petition, submitted that there are concurrent 
findings of facts recorded by both the Courts below which are based 
on proper appraisal of evidence and unless some material illegality or 
irregularity is pointed out, the same cannot be interfered with in 
revisional jurisdiction. She argued that the “Petitioner” was found 
responsible for prolonging the matter on various pretexts. She has 
relied on “MUHAMMAD SARWAR and others versus HASHMAL 
KHAN and others” (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 13), “Mst. 
ZARSHEDA versus NOBAT KHAN” (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 21), 

Civil Revision No.449/D of 2017

“SHAHBAZ GUL and others versus MUHAMMAD YOUNAS KHAN 
and others” (2020 SCMR 867) and “CANTONMENT BOARD 
through Executive Officer, Cantt. Board, Rawalpindi versus IKHLAQ 
AHMED and others” (2014 SCMR 161).  
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for both the sides at considerable 
length and also perused the record with their assistance. 
IV. 
DETERMINATION  
6. 
The record indicates that initially, the evidence of the 
“Respondent” was completed on 05.11.2012, and the case was

11 
15.01.2013 
-do- 
Despite clear cut waring, evidence 
was not produced. The “Petitioner” 
right was closed under Order XVI 
Rule 3 of CPC.  
 
7. 
It is apparent from the above tabled detail of proceedings of 
the trial Court that the “Petitioner” was afforded eleven adjournments 
spreading over more than two months for the production and 
recording of its evidence. Even, despite clear warnings i.e. “last 
opportunity”, “absolute last opportunity” for more than once and even 
warning as to application of penal provision under Order XVII Rule 3 
of the “CPC” by the trial Court, the “Petitioner” failed to produce 
any evidence which shows its adamant attitude towards the orders of 
the trial Court. Resultantly, the trial Court was left with no option but 
to pass following order: 
“15.01.2013     Present:  Counsel for the parties. 
 
 
Evidence 
of 
defendant 
is 
not 
available. Many opportunities have already been 
given to defendant for production of evidence but 
defendant has neither presented any evidence nor 
disclosed any reason for non-production of same, 
rather, defendant has not made any request for 
further adjournment. Consequently, defendant’s 
right to produce evidence is closed. Now to come 
up for final arguments on 17.01.2013.” 
 
8. 
Under Rule 1(1) of Order XVII of the “CPC”, the trial Court 
is vested with powers to adjourn the case on showing sufficient cause 
by either of the party and from time to time adjourn the hearing of the 
suit and Rule 1(2) of the said Order empowers the Court seized of the 
matter to fix a day for further hearing of the suit subject to costs 
occasion by the adjournment. Order XVII, Rule 3 of the “CPC” 
empowers the Court to proceed to decide the suit forthwith if a party, 
to whom time has been granted, fails to produce evidence, secure the 
attendance of witnesses, or perform any other act necessary for the 
further progress of the suit. For convenience, the said Rule 3 is 
reproduced hereunder for ease of reference: 

Civil Revision No.449/D of 2017   
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
“3. Court may proceed notwithstanding either 
party fails to produce evidence, etc: Where any 
party to a suit to whom time has been granted 
fails to produce his evidence, or to cause the 
attendance of his witnesses, or to perform any 
other act necessary to the further progress of 
the suit, for which time has been allowed, the 
Court may, notwithstanding each default, 
proceed to decide the suit forthwith.” 
 
9.  
The above provision of law was thoroughly considered and 
deliberated upon by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in “MOON 
ENTERPRISER CNG STATION, Rawalpindi, versus SUI NORTHERN 
GAS PIPELINES LIMITED through General Manager, Rawalpindi, 
and another” (2020 SCMR 300) holding two conditions to be 
satisfied before applying above penal provision of law to close the 
right of a party to produce evidence, which reads as:  
i. 
that time must have been granted at the request 
of a party to the suit to adduce evidence with a 
specific warning that said opportunity will be 
the last and failure to adduce evidence would 
lead to closure of the right to produce evidence; 
and  
ii. 
that the same party on the date which was fixed 
as the last opportunity fails to produce its 
evidence. 
 
10. 
In the present case, the learned trial Court used the discretion 
in favour of the “Petitioner” many a time by granting it adjournments 
for production of complete evidence (as tabulated above) but it failed 
to catch up the said leniency shown by the learned trial Court and 
even authorized representative of the “Petitioner” did not enter into 
the witness box so as to record his statement. The above picture of 
affairs makes it crystal clear that how the “Petitioner” pursued its 
case and also shows his disobedience and indifferent demeanour 
towards the orders of the Court; thus, such like indolent person cannot 
seek favour of law, because law favours the vigilant and not the 
indolent. In this regard reliance is placed on judgment reported as 
“RANA TANVEER KHAN versus NASEER-UD-DIN and others” 
(2015 SCMR 1401), wherein it has been unequivocally held:- 

Civil Revision No.449/D of 2017   
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
 
‘…………… it is clear from the record that the 
petitioner had availed four opportunities to 
produce his evidence and in two of such dates 
(the last in the chain) he was cautioned that 
such opportunities granted to him at his 
request shall be that last one, but still on the 
day when his evidence was closed in terms of 
Order XVII, Rule 3, C.P.C. no reasonable 
ground was propounded for the purposes of 
failure to adduce the evidence and justification 
for 
further 
opportunity, 
therefore, 
notwithstanding 
that 
these 
opportunities 
granted to the petitioner were squarely fell 
within the mischief of the provisions ibid and 
his evidence was rightly closed by the trial 
court. As far as the argument that at least his 
statement should have been recorded, suffice it 
to say that the eventuality in which it should be 
done has been elaborated in the latest verdict 
of this Court (2014 SCMR 637). From the 
record it does not transpire if the petitioner 
was present on the day when his evidence was 
closed and/or he asked the court to be 
examined; this has never been the case of the 
petitioner throughout the proceedings of his 
case at any stage; as there is no ground set out 
in the first memo of appeal or in the revision 
petition. 
 
  
It was further held that:-  
 
‘2. … Be that as it may, once the case is fixed 
by the Court for recording the evidence of the 
party, it is the direction of the court to do the 
needful, and the party has the obligation to 
adduce evidence without there being any fresh 
direction by the court, however, where the 
party makes a request for adjourning the 
matter to a further date(s) for the purpose of 
adducing evidence and if it fails to do so, for 
such date(s), the provisions of Order XVII, 
Rule 3, C.P.C. can attract, especially in the 
circumstances when adequate opportunities on 
the request of the party has been availed and 
caution is also issued on one of such a date(s), 
as being the last opportunity(ies).’

11. 
The above said view was further affirmed by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in “MOON ENTERPRISER CNG STATION, supra 
by holding that “the order to close the right to produce evidence must 
automatically follow failure to produce evidence despite last 
opportunity coupled with a warning. The trend of granting (Akhri 
Mouqa) then (Qatai Akhri Mouqa) and then (Qatai Qatai Akhri 
Mouqa) make a mockery of the provisions of law and those 
responsible to interpret and implement it. Such practices must be 
discontinued, forthwith.” In latest pronouncement on the identical 
issue, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in “IMRAN AHMAD KHAN 
NIAZI 
versus 
Main 
MUHAMMAD 
SHAHBAZ 
SHARIF”  
(2023 SCMR 636) has held that “leniency shown on part of judges 
of Trial Court in the matter of accommodating unjustified requests 
for adjournment, even at the cost of disregarding the timelines 
provided in the relevant laws, is unwarranted….Orders granting 
repetitive adjournments with warnings of "last and final" and 
"absolute last and final" opportunity become meaningless and 
shatter the confidence of the litigant public in the court orders and 
consequentially weaken the authority and fiat of the court” 
12. 
In view of law laid down in aforesaid judgments, the trial 
Court was quite justified in closing the right of the “Petitioner” 
through impugned order dated 15.01.2013 which, even otherwise, has 
not been challenged before any forum, thus attained finality. Without 
first getting obstacle of aforementioned order dated 15.01.2013, the 
“Petitioner” walked before lower Appellate Court mere to agitate 
against the judgment and decree in question passed by the trial Court 
and no justifiable reason backed by law is available in scenario at this 
belated stage to dislodge aforementioned order dated 15.01.2013.   
13. 
Returning to the merits of case in hand, it evinces from the 
impugned judgments and decrees that Exh.P2 is an admitted 
document, contents whereof have not been denied by the 
“Petitioner”, as is evident from para 2 and 3 of this petition. 
Important to mention here that Exh.P-2 is the agreement that was 
executed between the parties on 15.08.2006 according to which the 

Civil Revision No.449/D of 2017   
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
 
“Petitioner” had to handover 43 electric sign poles on the agreed sites 
however, the “Petitioner” remained unable to perform its undertaken 
commitments whereas on the other hand, Muhammad Umer Farook, 
Clerk Cantonment Board appeared in the witness box as PW-1 while 
Muhammad Iqbal Butt appeared as PW-2, both were cross examined 
by the “Petitioner”. Moreover, the “Petitioner” has neither denied the 
receiving of Rs.645,000/- from the “Respondent” nor receiving of 
three cheques given to the “Petitioner” by the “Respondent” on 
account of installment.  The parties cannot be allowed to blow hot and 
cold in single breath nor can they be allowed to assume divergent 
stances in their acts and conduct in connection with litigations in court 
of competent jurisdiction. Above indicated admission of Exh.P-2 on 
part of the “Petitioner” otherwise leaves behind no room for its 
challenge to the judgment and decree in issue. 
14. 
Furthermore, there are concurrent findings of facts recorded 
by both the courts below which are based on proper appraisal of 
evidence. No jurisdictional defect or material irregularity is 
pointed out by the “Petitioner” in either of the judgments and 
decrees under challenge. The revisional powers are limited and 
can only be exercised when the “Petitioner” succeeds in 
establishing that the impugned judgments suffers legal infirmities 
hedged in Section 115 of the “CPC”. As already observed that 
the “Petitioner” has failed to point out any illegality, material 
irregularity, mis-reading or non-reading in the judgments and 
decrees as well as order of both the Courts below, so the 
revisional jurisdiction is not meant to re-appraise the evidence in 
order to devise an inference other than the Courts below. It is 
observed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as 
“Mst. Farzana Zia and others Vs. Mst. Saadia Andaleeb and 
others” (2024 SCMR 916) that “the High Court has the powers 
to reevaluate the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the 
lower courts in appropriate cases but cannot upset such 

Civil Revision No.449/D of 2017   
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 
 
crystalized findings if the same are based on relevant evidence or 
without any misreading or non-reading of evidence. The first 
appellate court also expansively re-evaluated and re-examined 
the entire evidence on record. If the facts have been justly tried 
by two courts and the same conclusion has been reached by both 
the courts concurrently then it would not be judicious to revisit it 
for drawing some other conclusion or interpretation of evidence 
in a second appeal under Section 100 or under revisional 
jurisdiction under Section 115, C.P.C., because any such attempt 
would also be against the doctrine of finality.” Even earlier, it is 
held by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case cited as “Nasir Ali 
Vs. Muhammad Asghar” (2022 SCMR 1054) that “the High 
Court has very limited jurisdiction to interfere in the concurrent 
conclusions arrived at by the courts below while exercising 
power under section 115, C.P.C. … After scanning and browsing 
the evidence comprehensible on record, we reached to an 
irresistible conclusion that the interference made by the High 
Court in exercise of powers conferred under section 115, C.P.C. 
in the concurrent findings recorded by the Trial Court and 
Appellate Court was unjustified and unwarranted. Neither the 
Courts below have ignored material evidence or acted without 
evidence or drawn wrong inferences or conclusions from proved 
facts by applying the law erroneously, nor do the findings 
recorded amount to a dearth of evidence or suffering from any 
jurisdictional error or perversity.” Further it is settled by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as “Khudadad Vs. 
Syed Ghazanfar Ali Shah alias S. Inaam Hussain and others” 
(2022 SCMR 933) that “The High Court has a narrow and 
limited jurisdiction to interfere in the concurrent rulings arrived 
at by the courts below while exercising power under section 115, 
C.P.C. These powers have been entrusted and consigned to the 
High Court in order to secure effective exercise of its 

Civil Revision No.449/D of 2017   
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
 
superintendence and visitorial powers of correction unhindered 
by technicalities which cannot be invoked against conclusion of 
law or fact which do not in any way affect the jurisdiction of the 
court but confined to the extent of misreading or non-reading of 
evidence, jurisdictional error or an illegality of the nature in the 
judgment which may have material effect on the result of the case 
or the conclusion drawn therein is perverse or contrary to the 
law, but interference for the mere fact that the appraisal of 
evidence may suggest another view of the matter is not possible 
in revisional jurisdiction, therefore, the scope of the appellate 
and revisional jurisdiction must not be mixed up or bewildered. 
The interference in the revisional jurisdiction can be made only 
in the cases in which the order passed or a judgment rendered by 
a subordinate Court is found to be perverse or suffering from a 
jurisdictional error or the defect of misreading or non-reading of 
evidence and the conclusion drawn is contrary to law.” More or 
so the same principles have been elaborated, highlighted and 
settled by Supreme Court of Pakistan in cases reported as 
“Shahbaz Gul and others Vs. Muhammad Younas Khan and others” 
(2020 SCMR 867), “Noor Muhammad and others Vs. Mst. Azmat-e-
Bibi” (2012 SCMR 1373), “Hazara and others Vs. Muhammad Yar 
and others” (2011 SCMR 758), as that if evidence available on 
record is thoroughly examined by trial Court as well as First 
Appellate Court, the learned High Court, in exercise of its 
revisional jurisdiction, was not called upon to re-appraise and re-
evaluate the merits of evidence of the parties in the absence of 
any illegality or non-reading/ misreading of evidence. Moreover, 
the judgments referred to by learned counsel for the Petitioners cannot 
be relied upon being distinguishable from the facts and circumstances 
of the case as each and every case has its own merits. 
15. 
In view of above, this civil revision, being without any merit, 
is dismissed with no order as to costs.
