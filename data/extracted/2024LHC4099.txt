Date of Hearing: 
24.09.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Syed Riaz ul Hassan Gilani, 
Advocate. 
Respondent No.3 by: 
 
Malik Sajjad Haider Maitla and Malik 
M. Akram Bhatti, Advocates.  
 
      Anwaar Hussain, J. The petitioner filed an ejectment petition 
under the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (“the Act”) against 
respondent No.3 (“the respondent”) on the basis of a written tenancy 
agreement dated 25.01.2021 (“the tenancy agreement”) on grounds 
of default in payment of monthly rent for the months of November, 
2022, December, 2022, March, 2023 and September, 2023; sub-
letting; and damage to the rented premises. Leave to appear and 
contest the ejectment petition (“PLA”) was filed by the respondent. 
Plea was taken that the respondent is not defaulter. Through order 
dated 01.02.2024, learned Special Judge (Rent), Multan (“the Rent 
Tribunal”) declined the PLA on the ground that the rent has not been 
paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the tenancy 
agreement, which mandates that the rent shall only be paid in the bank 
account of the petitioner. Against order dated 01.02.2024 passed by 
the Rent Tribunal, an appeal was preferred by the respondent under 
Section 28 of the Act, which was accepted through the impugned 
judgment dated 05.07.2024 on the ground that the tenancy was valid 
till 31.01.2027 and since the respondent had cleared the amount due 
and in respect of allegations of sub-letting as well as damage to rented 
premises, recording of evidence is required, therefore, he is entitled to 
leave to defend in order to substantiate that he has not violated any 
terms and conditions of the tenancy agreement including payment of 
rent, hence, this constitutional petition.

2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that although expiry 
date of tenancy agreement is 31.01.2027, but the respondent has 
defaulted in payment of monthly rent, as a result of which eviction 
order was passed by the Rent Tribunal, but the same has been set 
aside by the Appellate Court below, without appreciating the factum 
of default and breach of the tenancy agreement committed by the 
respondent.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has supported 
the findings of the Appellate Court below with the averments that the 
payment of monthly rent for the disputed period was made in cash on 
the verbal direction of the petitioner on account of some health 
emergency and on one occasion in the bank account of brother of the 
petitioner. 
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
5. 
The nub of the matter is to examine whether a tenant, who fails 
to deposit the rent, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
tenancy agreement, is entitled to the acceptance of PLA in order to 
establish that he is not a defaulter.  
6. 
Before rendering the opinion on the legal question formulated 
hereinabove, it is pertinent to observe that the Act aims to consolidate 
the law relating to the relationship of landlord and tenant, inter alia, as 
to how the tenant is to be inducted in the rented premises and the 
eviction thereof can be obtained. Under the Act, a landlord shall not 
let out a premises to a tenant, except by a written and registered 
tenancy agreement as provided under Section 5 thereof and in terms 
of Section 6 of the Act, a tenancy agreement, inter alia, contain 
particulars of the landlord and tenant, description of the premises, 
period of tenancy, rate of rent, due date and mode of payment and 
particulars of bank account of the landlord if the rent is to be paid 
through a bank. The payment of the rent and what constitutes default 
thereof, under the law, is governed and determined by a conjunctive 

 
 
 
W.P. No.10130/2024

application of various provisions of the Act including Section 7 that 
reads as under:  
“7. Payment of rent.– (1) A tenant shall pay or 
tender the rent to the landlord in the mode and by 
the date mentioned in the tenancy agreement.” 
 
 
 
 
 
          (Emphasis supplied) 
In present case, the relationship of landlord and tenant is admitted 
between the parties. Clause-2 of the tenancy agreement, explicitly 
provides the mode of payment of rent in the following manner:

Once the parties had a consensus that monthly rent will be deposited 
on or before a particular date in a specified bank account of the 
petitioner-landlord, there is no room for the respondent-tenant to pay 
or tender the rent, through any mode other than one envisaged under 
the tenancy agreement, unless the landlord agrees in writing. Suffice 
to observe that the contracts are meant to be performed and the 
obligation undertaken by the parties are to be strictly adhered to, 
which, admittedly, has been violated by the respondent. In fact, the 
respondent took contradictory stance qua payment of rent. In his PLA, 
the respondent stated as under:

Whereas in ground (ii) of his appeal, before the Appellate Court 
below, the respondent admitted that he paid the monthly rent in cash 
for few months, which is reproduced hereunder:- 
“ii. 
That the allegation leveled by the respondent/ 
landlord against the appellant/tenant is totally false 
and illegal because the appellant paid the said rent 
amount for the month of November 2022, 
December 2022 and March 2023 through cash 
payment received by the respondent himself and 
for the month of September 2023 Rs.40,000/- of 
rent was transferred through bank account of 
appellant to Safeer Munawar on the direction of 
respondent, hence the appellant is not willful 
defaulter in any manner and continuously paying 
the rent amount, as such it was the case of 
evidence but the learned trial court without 
framing of issues and recording of evidence of 
both the parties dismissed the application for leave 
to defend and accepted the ejectment petition 
illegally and unlawfully.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
  
Once the respondent admitted that he has not paid the monthly rent in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the tenancy agreement, 
there was no room for allowing the PLA of the respondent enabling 
him to lead evidence after framing of issue qua default or other 
grounds of eviction. Such an exercise will defeat the intent of 
legislature as also the parties who have executed a written tenancy 
agreement containing specific terms and conditions. It is not 
permissible for the Courts to read into the contract-the tenancy 
agreement in present case, an implied or tacit term (payment in cash 
by the respondent in the present case) that is in direct conflict with its 
express terms and conditions i.e., clause-2 of the tenancy agreement 
reproduced hereinabove. A Court cannot allow a party to deviate from 
the terms and conditions of the contract, rather, it is a duty of the 
Court to intervene where enforcement of an agreement between the 

 
 
 
W.P. No.10130/2024 
 
 
 
5
parties is required. It is also not permissible for the Courts to excuse 
any of the parties from the consequence of the contract that they have 
freely and voluntarily accepted, even if they are shown to be onerous 
or oppressive. This is so as a matter of policy. This legal aspect of the 
matter has not been kept in sight by the Appellate Court below while 
passing the impugned judgment. Moreover, on a pointed question by 
this Court, learned counsel for the respondent admitted that the 
respondent is not seized with any receipt of payment of rent in cash, 
hence, this is a case where the principle of express or implied 
novation is also not attracted.  
7. 
In view of the above discussion, this petition is allowed and the 
impugned judgment passed by the Appellate Court below is set aside 
and order of the Rent Tribunal is upheld.
