Mr.Muhammad Masood Bilal, Advocate for the 
petitioners. 
Through this Civil Revision, the petitioners have 
assailed the order dated 16.07.2025 passed by the learned 
Appellate Court. 
2. 
The brief facts of the case are that respondents 
No.1 to 3 instituted a suit for specific performance of 
agreement to sell dated 29.01.2023 against respondents 
No.4 to 6. The suit, after recording of affirmative 
statement by defendant No.1/respondent No.4 and 
leading of evidence by the plaintiffs, was decreed 
through judgment and decree dated 23.09.2024. The 
petitioners, feeling aggrieved, preferred an appeal before 
the learned Appellate Court. During pendency thereof, 
respondents No.7 and 8 filed an application under 
Section 12(2) CPC before the trial court seeking setting 
aside of the judgment and decree dated 23.09.2024. In 
this backdrop, the petitioners moved an application 
before the learned Appellate Court seeking adjournment 
of the appeal sine die, which was dismissed through the 
impugned order dated 16.07.2025. Hence, the present 
Civil Revision.

C.R.No.1079 of 2025 
 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the 
impugned 
order 
dismissing 
their 
application 
is 
unwarranted, uncalled for, and liable to be set aside. It is 
submitted that the learned Appellate Court misread and 
misinterpreted the record as well as the settled principles 
of law, and thus failed to exercise jurisdiction vested in it 
in accordance with law. 
4. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners 
at length and perused the available record with due care. 
5. 
From the record, it emerges that the petitioners 
have already challenged the judgment and decree of the 
trial court in appeal before the learned Appellate Court, 
while their real brothers respondents No.7 and 8 have 
instituted a separate application under Section 12(2) CPC 
before the trial court against the very same judgment and 
decree. On that premise, the petitioners sought 
adjournment of their appeal sine die till the decision of 
the application under Section 12(2) CPC pending before 
the trial court. 
6. 
During the course of arguments, learned counsel 
for the petitioners was confronted to point out any lawful 
basis for adjourning the appellate proceedings sine die. 
The only justification offered was that, in the event the 
application under Section 12(2) CPC succeeds, the 
instant appeal would become infructuous. In other words, 
the entire purpose of the appellate proceedings would be 
eclipsed by the outcome of the said application. 
7. 
The contention so advanced by learned counsel is 
wholly misconceived. It is a settled principle of law that 
each lis must be adjudicated upon its own facts, 
circumstances, and merits. The appellate forum cannot 

3 
C.R.No.1079 of 2025 
 
withhold or defer adjudication merely on the speculations 
that some collateral proceedings, initiated by third 
parties, may eventually affect the outcome of the case at 
hand. Such an approach would not only paralyze the 
judicial process but also defeat the very object of 
expeditious disposal of litigation. The appellate forum is 
bound to decide the appeal on its own merits, 
independent of speculative consequences of collateral 
proceedings. 
8. 
It is further noteworthy that the scope of 
proceedings under section 12(2) CPC proceedings and 
appellate proceedings are in distinct legal domains. The 
pendency of one cannot furnish a lawful ground to 
suspend or frustrate the other. If the petitioners brothers 
succeed in their application under section 12(2) CPC, the 
law provides adequate remedies for parties to avail; 
however, till such eventuality arises, the appellate court 
cannot be compelled to put its own proceedings into 
abeyance. The Islamabad High Court in the case reported 
as National Highway Authority vs. M/s.China Petroleum 
Engineering Corporation (PLD 2017 Islamabad 1) held 
as under:-  
“.... True, the mere filing of an application under Section 
12(2) C.P.C. against the said judgment and decree dated 
20.04.2015 
would 
not 
render 
the 
instant 
appeal 
incompetent but, for the reasons mentioned above, this 
appeal cannot be kept pending or adjourned sine die until 
the decision of the appellant's application under Section 
12(2) C.P.C. by the Trial Court. An appeal is a 
continuation of the proceedings before the lower courts and 
should, in arbitration matters, be decided as expeditiously 
as possible.” 
9. 
It is also well settled that principle of finality of 
litigation is of paramount importance. Allowing appellate 
proceedings to be stalled indefinitely would encourage 
dilatory tactics, undermine the authority of Courts and 

4 
C.R.No.1079 of 2025 
 
compromise the administration of justice. The Appellate 
Court rightly refused to permit such abuse of process. 
10. 
In view of the above discussion, it is manifest that 
the learned Appellate Court committed no illegality or 
material irregularity while dismissing the application for 
sine die adjournment. The impugned order is well-
reasoned, in consonance with the settled principles of 
law, and calls for no interference in revisional 
jurisdiction. The petitioners have failed to point out any 
jurisdictional defect or legal infirmity in the impugned 
order. Consequently, this Civil Revision is devoid of 
merit and is hereby dismissed.
