hand raised to save herself. Perusal of description of given 
by the Women Medical Officer of MLC No.1188 of 2024 
reveals that she was having a sole injury on the back of her 
left hand and the Medical Officer could observe the 
availability of swelling without contusion, abrasion or 
laceration at the given seat of injury. Perusal of the order 
impugned dated 08.08.2024 passed by the learned 
Magistrate reveals that reasons which prevailed to decline 
the application moved by the petitioner for re-medico legal 
examination are that application was not carrying specific 
allegation regarding fabrication of injury and mainly that 
the application was to be moved within twenty-one days. 
In view of this Court, description of the injury given by 
the medical Officer, prima-facie, requires re-medico legal 
examination as according to the contents of crime report 
the injury was caused with a forceful blow of iron rod, a 
heavy blunt object but surprisingly injured was not having 
any contusion, abrasion or laceration on or around the 
given seat of injury. So far as the ground taken by the 
learned Magistrate to the effect that the application was to 
be moved within twenty-one days is concerned, in this 
regard two letters issued by Government of the Punjab, 
Health Department, being relevant are being reproduced 
hereunder:-

SUBJECT: CONSTITUTION OF SPECIAL MEDICAL BOARD

permanent District Boards for re-examination/re-post- 
mortem for 2nd medical opinion. The judicial officers may be 
advised to approach the relevant Boards whenever required. 
However, such orders may be passed within three weeks of 
the first examination. The opinion of the respective Boards

In the light of above mentioned two letters, this Court in a 
case titled Muhammad Anwar v. Dr. Ghulam Murtaza and 
5 others reported as (PLD 1998 Lahore 223) has observed 
as under:- 
 
“4. 
In the aforesaid letter dated 12-2-1990 the 
maximum period for medical re-examination was 
fixed as three weeks which stands enhanced to 
indefinite period vide letter dated 8-2-1992. The 
wisdom behind the issuance passed by the District 
Magistrate as a Judicial Officer for medical 
re-examination and in this regard he has to hear the 
adverse party interested in the matter and issue/pass 
the order containing the facts of the dispute, his 
reasons and his final decision thereof. The 
permanent 
District 
Medical 
Boards 
for 
re-examination/re-post-mortem for second medical 
opinion have been constituted in all the Districts in 
the Province of the Punjab and indulgence of this 
Court through the issuance of the writ for proposed 
relief is uncalled for. The petitioner can invoke the 
assistance of the District Magistrate, Kasur on the 
judicial side. It shall not be out of place to express 
that even though the time of three weeks from first 
medical examination stands enhanced vide aforesaid 
policy letter dated 8-2-1992 I would observe and 
hold that the same should be reasonable according to 
the discretion of the District Magistrate keeping in 
view the fact that the injuries on the person of 
injured to be medically re-examined are healed with 
the passage of time.” 
 
Further reference can also be made to the cases reported as 
Muhammad Rizwan v. The State & others (2017 MLD 
1828) and Maratab Mukhtar v. Government of The Punjab 
& others (2022 P.Cr.L.J 1293). In consideration of the 
facts mentioned above, this petition is allowed and
