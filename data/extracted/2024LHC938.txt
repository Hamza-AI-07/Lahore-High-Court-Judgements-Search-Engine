         13.03.2024 Mr. Javed Imran Ranjha, Advocate for the petitioner.  
 
Ms. Nuzhat Bashir, Deputy Prosecutor General for the State along with 
Malik Muhammad Idrees, Additional Inspector General of Police 
(Investigation), Punjab, Lahore, Anoosh Masood, Senior Superintendent 
of Police (Investigation), Babar Joiya, Superintendent of Police

Raja Amanat Ali Khan, Advocate for and with Ghaneem Aabir 
(respondent No.1, identified by his learned counsel).   
 
  
Through instant petition filed under Section: 497 (5) Cr.P.C.,                   
Muhammad Rafie (petitioner/complainant of case) has challenged the vires of 
order dated: 02.11.2023 passed by learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Lahore 
whereby Ghaneem Aabir (respondent No.1/accused) was granted pre-arrest bail 
in case arising out of F.I.R. No.847/2023 dated: 12.06.2023 registered under 
Sections: 420, 468, 471 PPC read with Section: 58 of the Legal Practitioners and 
Bars Councils Act, 1973 at Police Station: Civil Lines, Lahore.  
2.  
  
Briefly as per crime report (FIR) got recorded by the then Assistant 
Secretary, Punjab Bar Council, the Anti-Corruption Committee, Punjab Bar 
Council, while probing the matter came to the conclusion vide its order dated: 
20.05.2023 that Raja Ghaneem Abir (present respondent No.1) is posing himself 
as an advocate without having legal justification and defrauding general public. 
As per computer record, such person was not enrolled in the office of Punjab Bar 
Council and he was illegally posing himself as an advocate and appearing in the 
Courts of law. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that respondent No.1 has been 
granted bail before arrest vide impugned order against the law as well as facts of 
the case, therefore, same is liable to be cancelled by setting aside the impugned 
order. 
4. 
Learned counsel for respondent No.1 while supporting the impugned order 
submits that challan has been submitted in the court and there is no justification to 
recall the bail granted to the respondent No.1 at this stage.

5. 
Learned Deputy Prosecutor General while opposing the impugned order 
submits that allegation levelled against respondent No.1 has been established 
during investigation of the case and there was no justification to grant pre-arrest 
bail to respondent No.1; finally prays for setting aside the impugned order.   
 
6. 
Arguments heard and available record has been perused.  
 
7. 
It has been noticed that respondent No.1 is nominated in the crime report 
(FIR) with the specific allegation that he was not advocate but while posing 
himself as advocate, has committed fraud. Aforementioned allegation levelled 
against respondent No.1 has been established during investigation of the case and 
detail of some reported cases in which he appeared as advocate has been 
appended at pages No.9-12 of this petition as Annexure “B”. Sufficient material is 
available on the record to connect respondent No.1 with the commission of 
alleged offences. It goes without saying that Advocate is such a trusted statutory 
entity that person comes to him, shares most confident and valuable issues of 
his/her life with him, hands over documents including valuable instruments along 
with fee to him/her but if he/she is not advocate, then it is not mere cheating with 
the clients/public-at-large and actual advocates but also with the courts where he/ 
she appears while posing himself/herself as advocate. So, it is heinous/serious 
offence against the entire legal system of the country.  Any mala fide, malice or 
ulterior motive on part of complainant or investigating agency could not be 
referred in the case. Pre-arrest bail is an extra-ordinary concession, which is 
meant for protecting innocent people and same is granted only and if reasonable 
grounds are existing on the record to show that accused is not guilty of the 
alleged offence rather the case is of further inquiry and furthermore intended 
arrest of the accused is an outcome of mala fide, malice and ulterior motive for 
humiliating him; in this regard, case of “AHTISHAM ALI versus The STATE” 
(2023 S C M R 975) can be safely referred and its relevant portion from  its 
paragraph No.7 is hereby reproduced: - 
 
7.  
It is a well settled exposition of law that the grant of pre-
arrest bail is an extraordinary relief which may be granted in 
extraordinary situations to protect the liberty of innocent persons in 
cases lodged with mala fide intention to harass the person with 
ulterior motives. By all means, while applying for pre-arrest bail, the 
petitioner has to satisfy the Court with regard to the basic conditions 
quantified under section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 ("Cr.P.C.") vis-à-vis the existence of reasonable grounds to 
confide that he is not guilty of the offence alleged against him and 
the case is one of further inquiry. In the case of Rana Abdul Khaliq 
v. The State and others (2019 SCMR 1129), this Court held that 
grant of pre-arrest bail is an extra ordinary remedy in criminal 
jurisdiction; it is a diversion of the usual course of law, arrest in

cognizable cases; it is a protection to the innocent being hounded on 
trumped up charges through abuse of process of law, therefore a 
petitioner seeking judicial protection is required to reasonably 
demonstrate that the intended arrest is calculated to humiliate him 
with taints of mala fide; it is not a substitute for post arrest bail in 
every run of the mill criminal case as it seriously hampers the course 
of investigation. Ever since the advent of Hidayat Ullah Khan's case 
(PLD 1949 Lahore 21), the principles of judicial protection are 
being faithfully adhered to till date, therefore, grant of pre-arrest 
bail essentially requires considerations of mala fide, ulterior motive 
or abuse of process of law, situations wherein Court must not 
hesitate to rescue innocent citizens; these considerations are 
conspicuously missing in the present case. While in the case of                             
Rana Muhammad Arshad v. Muhammad Rafique and another 
(PLD 2009 SC 427), this Court has discussed the framework and 
guidelines for granting bail before arrest under section 498, Cr.P.C. 
by the High Courts and Courts of Session. It was held that the 
exercise of this power should be confined to cases in which not only 
a good prima facie ground is made out for the grant of bail in 
respect of the offence alleged, but also it should be shown that if the 
petitioner were to be arrested and refused bail, such an order would, 
in all probability, be made not from motives of furthering the ends of 
justice in relation to the case, but from some ulterior motive, and 
with the object of injuring the petitioner, or that the petitioner would 
in such an eventuality suffer irreparable harm. This Court laid down 
the following parameters for pre- arrest bail:- 
 
(a) grant of bail before arrest is an extraordinary relief to be 
granted only in extraordinary situations to protect innocent 
persons against victimization through abuse of law for 
ulterior motives;  
 
(b) pre-arrest bail is not to be used as a substitute or as an 
alternative for post-arrest bail; 
 
(c) bail before arrest cannot be granted unless the person 
seeking it satisfies the conditions specified through 
subsection (2) of section 497 of Code of Criminal Procedure 
i.e. unless he establishes the existence of reasonable grounds 
leading to a belief that he was not guilty of the offence 
alleged against him and that there were, in fact, sufficient 
grounds warranting further inquiry into his guilt;  
 
(d) not just this but in addition thereto, he must also show 
that his arrest was being sought for ulterior motives, 
particularly on the part of the police; to cause irreparable 
humiliation to him and to disgrace and dishonour him; 
 
(e) such a petitioner should further establish that he had not 
done or suffered any act which would disentitle him to a 
discretionary relief in equity e.g. he had no past criminal 
record or that he had not been a fugitive at law; and finally 
that;  
 
(f) in the absence of a reasonable and a justifiable cause, a 
person desiring his admission to bail before arrest must in 
the first instance approach the Court of first instance i.e. the 
Court of Sessions, before petitioning the High Court for the 
purpose.”

So, respondent No.1 has been granted pre-arrest bail in the case against the settled 
principles of law on the subject as well as material available on the record and 
impugned order is perverse, capricious, arbitrary as well as fanciful and thus not 
sustainable in the eyes of law.  It is by now also well settled that if bail has been 
granted to accused while ignoring sufficient material available against him on the 
record, then it is to be recalled; in this regard, guidance has been sought from the 
case of “MUHAMMAD RAFIQUE versus The STATE and others” (P L D 
2022 Supreme Court 694) and its paragraph No.6 is hereby reproduced: - 
“6.  
Although this Court ordinarily refrains from interfering with bail 
granting orders of the High Courts, it does not shy away to perform its 
constitutional obligation to set the matter right for the safe 
administration of criminal justice when a High Court has made such an 
order in derogation of some settled principle of law, or when the order 
is found to be perverse or arbitrary. In the present case, while allowing 
the bail petition of respondent No.2 and making the impugned order the 
High Court has acted against the above said settled principle of law, 
and its finding recorded on the basis of an unsubstantiated cross-version 
is perverse, that is, against the weight of the material available on 
record of the case. Therefore, we convert this petition into appeal and 
allow the same: the impugned bail granting order is set aside and the 
bail petition of respondent No.2 is dismissed. Respondent No.2 shall 
surrender before the trial court.” 
 
Since respondent No.1 was not entitled to grant of pre-arrest bail (as discussed 
above), so submission of challan, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, 
cannot place any embargo for cancellation of bail and case of “AMIR FARAZ 
versus The STATE” (2023 SCMR 308) can be advantageously referred in this 
regard.  
8. 
 
In view of what has been discussed above, impugned order dated: 
02.11.2023 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore, whereby 
Ghaneem Aabir (respondent No.1/accused person) has been granted pre-arrest bail 
in the case, is hereby set aside;  resultantly, pre-arrest bail granted to respondent 
No.1 vide aforementioned impugned order is hereby recalled. With this 
observation, instant petition stands allowed. It is, however, clarified that 
observations made herein are just tentative in nature and strictly confined to the 
disposal of instant bail petition. Station House Officer, Police Station: Civil Lines, 
District Lahore shall proceed in accordance with law.
