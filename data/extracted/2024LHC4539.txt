applicant-department. 
Mr. Khubaib Ahmad, Advocate for the respondent-
taxpayer.  
 
 
Through instant Sales Tax Reference Application, 
following questions are proposed for determination, in 
the context of the order of 24.08.2021, 
i) 
Whether on the facts and circumstances of the 
case Ld. ATIR was justified to entitle benefits of 
a registered person to the persons liable to be 
registered in terms of Section 2(25) by ignoring 
the proviso attached to Section 2(25) and by 
bypassing the express provisions set out in 
Section 73(4) of the Sales Tax Act, 1990? 
 
ii) 
Whether on the facts and circumstances of the 
case Ld. ATIR was justified to overstep express 
provisions of law provided u/s 73(4) of the 
Sales Tax Act, 1990 and strike down the 
demand under the garb of ‘liable to be 
registered’ as provided u/s 2(25) of the Sales 
Tax Act, 1990? 
 
2. 
Questions raised primarily seek interpretation of 
sub-section (4) of Section 73, in the context of the scope 
and effect of section 2(25) of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 
(Act, 1990). It is appropriate to reproduce relevant 
provisions, under discussion, which read as,  
 
“Subsection (4) of section 73 of Act, 1990.  

                                      S.T.R. No.34/2023.

A registered person shall not be entitled to deduct input tax 
(credit adjustment or deduction of input tax) which is 
attributable to such taxable supplies exceeding, in 
aggregate, one hundred million rupees in financial year or 
ten million rupees in a tax period as are made to certain 
person who is not a registered person under this Act.” 
 
Section 2 (25) of the Act, 1990. 
“Registered person” means a person who is registered or is 
liable to be registered under this Act: 
Provided that a person liable to be registered but 
not registered under this Act shall not be entitled to 
any benefit available to a registered person under 
any of the provisions of this Act or the rules made 
thereunder.” 
 
3. 
It is case of the applicant department that in terms 
of sub-section (4) of section 73 of the Act, 1990, benefit 
was only extended to the registered person, in the context 
of taxable supplies made to the person not registered, 
within prescribed monetary limits. Submits that proviso 
to section 2(25) of the Act, 1990 is not available to 
respondent for claiming benefit, outside the scope of sub-
section (4) of section 73 of the Act, 1990. And no 
question of claiming benefit by non-registered recipient 
of taxable supplies arose.    
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the registered 
person, respondent, contends that by legislative fiat status 
of deemed registration is acknowledged, qua the person 
not registered but otherwise liable to be registered. Adds 
that negligence of the department to effect registration of 
an eligible person cannot be instrumental in denying 
benefit to the respondent, who is entitled to seek input tax 
adjustment(s) against supplies made to persons, even 
liable to be registered, irrespective of the monetary limits 
prescribed. Explains that recipient of supply is liable to 
be registered under section 14 (e) of the Act, 1990.  
5. 
Heard. 
6. 
At the outset, it appears that submission by the 
counsel suffers from self-contradiction. Appellate 

                                      S.T.R. No.34/2023.

Tribunal recorded findings to the effect that supplier in 
this case, which is respondent, had paid further tax 
against the supplies made to persons not registered, who 
had not obtained registration number in terms of section 
3 (1A) of Act, 1990. If recipients of supplies, who have 
had not obtained registration number, are treated as not 
registered persons for the purposes of further tax, how 
could they be treated as deemed registered person for the 
purposes of sub-section (4) of Section 73 of the Act, 
1990. It is axiomatic that on one hand respondent had 
paid further tax qua the supplies made to person, without 
obtained registration number, and on the other, benefit is 
claimed simultaneously qua the supplies to person not 
registered, but simply claim to be potentially registerable 
persons under section 2(25) of the Act, 1990. 
  
Sub-section (4) of section 73 of the Act, 1990 
contemplates and extends specific / exclusive benefit to 
the registered person, upon allowing claim of input tax 
qua taxable supplies when made within the limits 
prescribed, which benefit, by any stretch of imagination, 
cannot be doled out to non-registered recipient by 
banking upon section 2(25) of the Act, 1990, which 
section cannot be construed contrary to the subject and 
context of sub-section (4) of section 73 of the Act, 1990. 
We have no ambiguity that in case of inconsistency 
between section 2(25) of the Act and sub-section (4) of 
section 73 of the Act, 1990, latter provision of the law 
would prevail – definition clause starts with qualification 
that ‘In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the 
subject or context”. Sub-section (4) of section 73 of the 
Act, 1990 cannot be rendered repugnant by extending 
preference to the definition / interpretation clause. Even 
otherwise proviso to section 2(25) of the Act, 1990 
envisaged benefit for potentially registerable person and 
such benefit cannot be extended or claimed by the 

                                      S.T.R. No.34/2023.

registered person. Sub-section (4) of section 73 of the 
Act, 1990 is a special provision, dealing with specific 
situation and providing special concession / benefit, and 
effect thereof cannot be invalidated in the context of 
general provisions. Reference to section 8(1)(m) of the 
Act, 1990 by Appellate Tribunal is misplaced, which 
provision specifically deals with input goods, attributable 
to the supplies. 
7. 
In view of the aforesaid, Appellate Tribunal 
misconstrued scope, extent and distinctiveness of sub-
section (4) of section 73 of the Act, 1990, which erred in 
law while extending unwarranted preference to section 
2(25) of the Act, 1990, which construction and treatment 
constitute an illegality. 
8. 
First and second questions are answered in 
negative. Reference Application is decided in favour of 
applicant department. 
9. 
Office shall send a copy of this order, under seal of 
the Court, to learned Appellate Tribunal, in terms of sub-
section (5) of section 47 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
