20.05.2014 against which the department filed an appeal (RI-
332/2014) before PLAT which stood dismissed vide judgment, 
dated 16.06.2015. The department put a challenge to the

order, dated 02.11.2015. Later on, services of said respondents, 
alongwith others, were regularized by the department vide Office 
Order bearing No.DAF/WASA/501/683, dated 16.12.2015.   
On the same footing, respondents No.15 & 16, alongwith 
others, preferred Grievance Petition (No.101/2015) before the 
Labour Court seeking regularization of their services against the 
posts held by them which was accepted vide judgment, dated 
04.02.2016, against which the department filed an appeal (RI-

2. 
In the second round, the private respondents filed 
complaints under sections 33(8), 65 & 66 of the Punjab Industrial 
Relations Act, 2010. Through order, dated 16.10.2018, the 
Labour Court directed the Managing Director and the Director 

 
 
WP No. 3439 of 2019/RWP. 
--4-- 
 
(Admin) WASA, Rawalpindi, to regularize services of the 
private respondents (petitioners therein) against the posts 
mentioned in Para No.7 of said order and fixed the matter for 
compliance, for 20.11.2018. Being aggrieved of order, dated 
16.10.2018, the department filed revision petition (RI-515/2019) 
before PLAT which was dismissed vide judgment, dated 
20.09.2019; hence this petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel representing the department submits that 
while implementing the decisions of the Labour Court, which 
remained intact upto this Court, services of the private 
respondents were regularized against the posts mentioned by 
them in their Grievance Petitions, thus, they were debarred to file 
implementation petitions out of which present petition has 
emanated. Adds that while passing the impugned verdicts both 
the fora below failed to consider that no party can claim relief 
beyond its pleadings. Further adds that both the forums below 
omitted to note that after regularization of their services the 
private respondents have been enjoying perks and privileges of a 
regular employee, hence, they could not approach the Labour 
Court seeking regularization against the posts other than those 
mentioned by them in their Grievance Petitions. Argues that not 
only their respective designations were mentioned in the 
Grievance Petitions but the same were also incorporated in their 

 
 
WP No. 3439 of 2019/RWP. 
--5-- 
 
affidavits, hence, they were estopped to claim anything contrary 
to the recitals of the said documents. 
4. 
Mr. Naseer Ahmad Tanoli, Advocate for respondents No. 
8, 9, 12, 14, 15 & 16 states that since services of his clients were 
not regularized against the posts for which they were appointed, 
no illegality has been committed by the fora below while 
rendering the impugned decisions. 
5. 
In rebuttal to the arguments advanced by learned counsel 
representing private respondents No. 8, 9, 12, 14, 15 & 16, 
learned counsel for the department states that since service rules 
for WASA employees were framed in the year 2012 and the 
employees, who were deficient in respect of eligibility criteria 
against the posts held by them, were regularised against other 
available posts, thus, no ill-will or mala-fide can be attributed to 
WASA authorities in that regard. 
6. 
Khawaja Muhammad Arif, Advocate appearing on behalf 
of respondents No.3 to 7, 10, 11, 13 & 16, while supporting the 
impugned decisions, states that there is no mention of any 
designation under Standing Order No.1(b) of the Schedule 
attached with Industrial & Commercial Employment (Standing 
Order) Ordinance, 1968 (the Ordinance, 1968) in terms of 
section 2(g) thereof, thus, the private respondents were entitled 
for confirmation against the posts on which they were working 
at the relevant time. Adds that section 33(8) of the Punjab 

 
 
WP No. 3439 of 2019/RWP. 
--6-- 
 
Industrial Relations Act, 2010 (PIRA, 2010) empowers the 
Labour Court to get enforced its decision, thus, no illegality was 
committed by fora below while rendering the impugned 
decisions. 
7. 
While rebutting the arguments advanced by learned 
appearing on behalf of respondents No.3 to 7, 10, 11, 13 & 16, 
learned counsel for the department states that according to the 
law laid down in Mahmood-ul-Hassan v. Munir Ahmad and 3 
others (2018 MLD 771) no relief can be given to any party 
beyond its pleadings and when the private respondents 
themselves incorporated their designations in their respective 
Grievance Petitions, they could not be awarded anything in 
excess thereof.  
8. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at considerable 
length and have also gone through the documents, annexed with 
this petition, as well as the case-law, cited at the bar.  
9. 
It is admitted position that the private respondents filed 
four sets of Grievance Petitions by incorporating nomenclatures 
of the posts held by them. According to Standing Order No.1(b) 
of the Schedule attached with the Ordinance, 1968, a workman 
who performs duties for more than three months against a post 
of permanent nature attains status of a permanent workman. 
When the private respondents themselves incorporated their 
respective designations in their Grievance Petitions , no contrary 

 
 
WP No. 3439 of 2019/RWP. 
--7-- 
 
view could be adopted by the fora below while dealing with 
implementation petitions. 
10. 
Indisputably, the Grievance Petitions filed by the private 
respondents were accepted by the Labour Court and the said 
decisions remained intact upto this Court. A bare reading of the 
decisions rendered by the Labour Court, accepting the Grievance 
Petitions filed by the private respondents which were upheld by 
the PLAT as well as this Court, shows that there was no mention 
of any designation against which the private respondents were to 
be regularized. However, while dealing with implementation 
petitions, the Labour Court and PLAT introduced scheme of 
designations of the private respondents, for the first time, in utter 
violation of Standing Order No.1(b) ibid and their earlier 
decisions, which had attained finality. 
11. 
The inconsistent attitude of the private respondents is 
evident from the fact that on the one hand Khawaja Muhammad 
Arif, Advocate, representing respondents No. 3 to 7, 10, 11, 13 
& 16, pleaded that the private respondents were entitled to 
regularization against the posts being held by them in terms of 
Standing Order No.1(b) ibid, irrespective of any service rules 
framed by the department subsequently, but on the other was 
unable to convince this Court as to how the private respondents 
can claim particular designations in violation of Standing Order 
No.1(b) ibid as it speaks about permanent status of a workman 

 
 
WP No. 3439 of 2019/RWP. 
--8-- 
 
on completion of three months against a post likely to be 
continued for more than nine months. 
12. 
It is well established by now that the Executing/ 
Implementing Court cannot sit over the judgment/decision 
implementation whereof has been sought. Reliance in this regard 
is placed on the case reported as Irshad Masih and others v. 
Emmanuel Masih and others (2014 SCMR 1481), Tauqeer 
Ahmad Qureshi v. Additional District Judge, Lahore and 2 
others (PLD 2009 SC 760) and Mst. Naseem Akhtar and 4 others 
v. Shalimar General Insurance, Company Limited and 2 others 
(1994 SCMR 22). Though learned counsel representing the 
private respondents addressed the Court at length but has not 
been able to convince this Court as to how the private 
respondents were entitled to regularization against the posts out 
of those mentioned in their Grievance Petitions or for which they 
were not eligible. 
13. 
This Court is cognizant of the fact that respondents No.8, 
9, 12, 14, 15 & 16 were not regularized against the posts 
mentioned by them in their Grievance Petitions, however, the 
explanation provided by the learned counsel representing the 
department that as they did not fulfill the eligibility criteria for 
appointment/regularization against the posts being held by them 
in terms of the service rules framed for the employees of WASA 
Rawalpindi, in the year 2012, being persuasive, cannot be 

 
 
WP No. 3439 of 2019/RWP. 
--9-- 
 
discarded lightly. Though, learned counsel appearing on behalf 
of the private respondents claimed that the eligibility of their 
clients was to be determined at the time of their induction in 
service but when they completed the requisite period, they were 
entitled for regularization against the post being held by them but 
I do not agree with the learned counsel for the reason that it is 
admitted position that the private respondents were hired without 
adopting the due process, thus, their eligibility to hold any post 
on regular basis could not be bypassed especially when the 
service rules were framed by WASA much prior to issuance of 
orders regarding their regularization. Had the private 
respondents been inducted in service upon fulfilment of requisite 
criteria they could have claimed exemption from the scrutiny at 
the time of regularization of their services. A learned Division 
Bench of this Court in the case of University of Agriculture and 
others v. Tasneem Kausar and others (2018 PLC (C.S.) Note 
183), while dealing with the powers of the competent authority 
to determine the eligibility of an employee for regularization has 
inter-alia concluded as under:- 
“16. In our view suitability and eligibility of a candidate 
cannot be compromised at the cost of length of service or 
any other consideration without going through a process 
and any such exercise would be against the dictates of 
Articles 240 and 242 of the Constitution……” 
If the explanation provided by the learned counsel representing 
the department is considered in the light of the afore-quoted 

 
 
WP No. 3439 of 2019/RWP. 
--10-- 
 
decision of a learned Division Bench of this Court there leaves 
no ambiguity that the same is worth consideration.  
14. 
It is imperative to note that bona-fide of the departmental 
authorities is established from the fact that instead of dispensing 
with the services of the employees, who were deficient in respect 
of eligibility criteria, vis-à-vis the service rules framed in the year 
2012, regularized them against other available posts. In this 
scenario, instead of forming any adverse opinion against the 
departmental authorities same should be lauded and the 
impugned direction issued by the Labour Court, upheld by 
PLAT, to the Managing Director and the Director (Admin), 
WASA, Rawalpindi does not seem to be reasonable.  
15. 
While addressing the Court, learned counsel representing 
the private respondents took specific plea that since grievance of 
their clients with respect to their regularization in terms of their 
appointment orders was not redressed, their implementation 
petitions were maintainable and no illegality was committed by 
the Labour Court while issuing impugned direction. In this 
regard, I do not see eye-to-eye with learned counsel for the 
private respondents for the reason that if the private respondents 
were of the view that still any grievance existed in respect of their 
regularization, instead of filing implementation petitions they 
were supposed to file fresh Grievance Petition(s). In this 

 
 
WP No. 3439 of 2019/RWP. 
--11-- 
 
backdrop, the impugned decisions rendered by the fora below are 
not sustainable. 
16. 
Now coming to the case-law, referred by Mr. Tanoli, I am 
of the view that the same is inapplicable to the facts and 
circumstances of the present case inasmuch as in the said case 
the petitioners were inducted in service upon fulfilment of 
eligibility criteria prevalent at that time whereas in the matter in 
hand the service rules were framed first time in the year 2012, 
their eligibility to hold a post on regular basis was to be 
determined by the departmental authorities in the light of the said 
rules. Moreover, the rules in the referred case were also relaxed 
by the Chief Minister of the province which is not the position in 
the case in hand. Thus, the said case is polls apart from the case 
in hand. 
17. 
For what has been noted above, I have no hesitation to hold 
that the Labour Court travelled beyond its jurisdiction while 
issuing the impugned direction. Likewise, PLAT instead of 
applying its independent mind toed the line of the Labour Court, 
thus, their findings cannot be considered as sacrosanct. 
Consequently, this petition is accepted and the impugned 
decisions of the fora below are set-aside with no order as to 
costs.
