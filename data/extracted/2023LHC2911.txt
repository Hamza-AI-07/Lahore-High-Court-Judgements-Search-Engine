Crl. Rev. No.340 of 2013.

aggrieved with the impugned judgments, petitioner has preferred instant 
revision petition.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that on 02.5.2010 the complainant along 
with his two sons namely Ghulam Shabbir and Ghulam Farid 
accompanied by Muhammad Anwar and Muhammad Arshad sons of 
Bashir on their way to village while riding on two motorcycles 
No.8400/HDF 125-CC and 7817/FS when reached at Shahkot Jaranwala 
Road near Madni Mohallah, there Irshad alias Taidi armed with 12-bore 
repeater and Zulfiqar Ali armed with pistol were standing on motorcycle 
who while calling Ghulam Farid and Muhammad Arshad stopped them; 
in the meanwhile, a police van came from front wherefrom, Iftikhar 
constable (convict) deboarded with his official Kalashnikov and he along 
with his brothers Zulfiqar and Irshad started indiscriminate firing in 
order to murder Ghulam Farid and Muhammad Arshad who sustained 
injuries.  
 
Motive behind the occurrence was the registration of an FIR by 
the complainant against accused Iftikhar etc. for committing fraud of 
tractor. 
3. 
After observing all codal formalities, report under section 173 of 
Cr.PC was submitted before the learned trial Court. Charge was framed 
against the accused to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be 
tried. 
4. 
At the trial, prosecution examined Abdul Qadeer complainant 
(PW.1), Muhammad Arshad injured witness (PW.2), other injured 
witness namely Ghulam Farid (PW.3), Rafaqat Ali ASI (PW.4), Abdul 
Khaliq SI (PW.5), Muhammad Ilyas 186/C (PW.6), Dr. Muhammad 
Ashraf (PW.7) and Zaheer-ud-Din ASI (PW.8). On close of prosecution 
evidence, statement of accused under section 342 Cr.PC was recorded 
wherein he denied the prosecution version, however, did not opt to 
produce defence evidence nor to record his own statement under section 
340(2) Cr.PC.  
5. 
Though a report of Superintendent District Jail Sheikhupura is 
available on file, according to which the petitioner has been released 
from jail on 07.06.2016 after expiry of sentence and payment of Arsh as 

 
Crl. Rev. No.340 of 2013.  
3 
 
well as Daman amount imposed upon him, however, learned counsel for 
the petitioner urges decision of the case on merits while raising various 
grounds including that occurrence was result of grappling and fires hit 
by mistake. 
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
7. 
Occurrence was of 02.05.2010 at 10:00 p.m. (night), wherein, as a 
result of indiscriminate firing made by the petitioner and his two 
brothers namely Zulfiqar Ali and Irshad alias Taidi, two persons namely 
Ghulam Farid and Muhammad Arshad received injuries which resulted 
into amputation of leg of Muhammad Arshad and fracture of leg of 
Ghulam Farid. Prosecution has produced Abdul Qadeer complainant 
(PW.1) who by reiterating the story of FIR stated that on the alleged day 
of occurrence, three brothers including the present petitioner started 
firing with their respective weapons upon injured Ghulam Farid and 
Arshad, whereas, the injured witnesses namely Muhammad Arshad and 
Ghulam Farid while appearing as PW.2 and PW.3, respectively, deposed 
with a different version that on the alleged day, a police dala came from 
front, police officials by signaling light stopped them, Iftikhar Ahmad 
deboarded from the vehicle and opened burst of his Kalashnikov upon 
them. They had not given any role to other two accused. During cross-
examination, they deposed that petitioner Iftikhar Ahmad after coming 
out from the vehicle started abusing them and in response they also used 
same language against him. PW.2 though deposed that after 15/20 days 
of the occurrence when he read FIR, he came to know that complainant 
got lodged FIR against Irshad, Zulfiqar and Iftikhar, wherein, allegation 
of firing and causing injuries was levelled against all above three 
accused, however, he did not disclose to the complainant that firing was 
not made by all the three accused and it was only the petitioner who 
made firing and FIR has been wrongly registered against all the accused. 
In the light of above circumstances, the presence of complainant at the 
place of occurrence is doubtful and even his statement is contrary to the 
statement of injured witnesses as well as the other eye-witness namely 
Ilyas constable who stated that only two injured were available at the 

 
Crl. Rev. No.340 of 2013.  
4 
 
crime scene and reviling continued for one or two minutes and after 
sustaining injuries by the injured persons, police took them to the 
hospital within half an hour. Even PW.5 admits that after receiving 
information of the occurrence, he took the injured within 10/15 minutes 
to the hospital and confined the accused in police lock-up on the same 
night. However, in his statement recorded under section 342 Cr.PC 
petitioner stated that he volunteered his arrest at the crime scene and this 
fact has been supported by the statement of Abdul Khaliq (PW.5) who 
admitted that he had confined the accused after returning from hospital. 
Even application for medical examination of the injured was submitted 
by Abdul Khaliq SI and not the complainant. This fact also doubts the 
presence of complainant at the spot. Moreover, Ghulam Sabir and 
Anwar who were also in the company of complainant as alleged in FIR 
have not been produced during trial.  
8. 
Admittedly, in the instant occurrence, two persons received 
firearm injuries at the hands of present petitioner and whether his 
intention was to kill them, the defence has taken the stance that there 
was exchange of hot words between the petitioner and injured persons 
and, during this altercation, they tried to snatch official rifle from the 
petitioner which suddenly went off during grappling, otherwise, the 
petitioner had no intention to inflict injuries. The fact of using filthy 
language against each other has been admitted by the injured witnesses 
namely Muhammad Arshad (PW.2) and Ghulam Farid (PW.3) during 
their cross-examination. Moreover, fire hit the legs from a short distance, 
therefore, in such circumstances; possibility cannot be brushed aside that 
during grappling rifle suddenly went off and hit the legs of injured. Dr. 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW.7) medically examined both the injured and 
observed ‘blackening’ around injury No.2 of Ghulam Farid and in injury 
No.1 of Muhammad Arshad. Such observation of doctor regarding 
blackening establishes the fact that there was a short distance in between 
petitioner and injured and they might have received injuries during 
grappling. Learned trial court in para-17 of the judgment though 
observed that: 

 
Crl. Rev. No.340 of 2013.  
5 
 
“Even prosecution story is not proved as in the manner 
mentioned in the complaint and injured witnesses made false 
improvement while giving evidence, yet, admission on the 
part of accused about presence at the place of occurrence 
and of the injured is sufficient to prove that the accused 
armed with official rifle opened the fire”.  
 
Yet admission or confession made by the accused should have been 
considered as a whole. Reliance in this respect is placed in the case 
reported as “ALI AHMAD and another versus The STATE and others” 
(PLD 2020 Supreme Court 201) wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
has held that “When prosecution fails to prove its case the statement of 
the accused, under section 342 Cr.P.C. is to be considered in its entirety 
and accepted as a fact”. This has been held in following manner; 
 
20. The principles surrounding section 342, Cr.P.C have evolved for 
over a period of the last about two hundred years beginning with the 
case of Sarah Jones34 (decided in 1827) and taking shape in 
Balmakund35 as follows: 
 "...where there is no other evidence to show affirmatively that 
any portion of the exculpatory element in the confession is false, 
the Court must accept or reject the confession as a whole and 
cannot accept only the inculpatory element while rejecting the 
exculpatory element as inherently incredible." 
 
In the same judgment it has further been held; 
 
Muhammad Munir, J., in Rahim Bakhsh22, regarding statement under 
section 342, Cr.P.C. wrote: "I know of no law which says that an 
admission made by an accused person in or out of court unless it is 
vitiated by any such circumstances as are mentioned in the Indian 
Evidence Act, cannot be considered to be a matter which the court may 
take into consideration in coming to its conclusion." The 
circumstances which can vitiate an admission or confession, referred 
to by the learned Judge, may be of inducement, threat or promise 
under which a particular statement is made. A statement under section 
342, Cr.P.C. having been made by an accused before court in presence 
of his counsel has little chance of suffering from such circumstances. 
 
9. 
In the circumstances, since the injuries caused by the petitioner are 
established but as observed above, there was no intention of the 
petitioner to cause such injuries and occurrence was result of a hustle 
bustle and grappling wherein rifle of accused/petitioner went off. Such 
grappling is also comprehensible when there exists an enmity between 
the parties; therefore, injuries were caused by Mistake (khata) attracting 

 
Crl. Rev. No.340 of 2013.  
6 
 
section 337-I PPC and the conviction and sentence of the petitioner 
under section 337-F(v) PPC is not sustainable. Section 337-I is 
reproduced hereunder for reference; 
 
337-I. Punishment for causing hurt by mistake (khata).__ 
Whoever causes hurt by mistake (Khata) shall be liable to arsh or 
daman specified for the kind of hurt caused. 
 
Though there is no definition of mistake (khata) in PPC but import of 
section 318 PPC makes it clear that causing harm either by mistake of 
act or mistake of fact amounts to khata and section 319 PPC labels a rash 
and negligent act as khata, therefore, in the light of above observation, 
while setting aside the conviction and sentence under section 337 F(v) 
PPC, petitioner is convicted under section 337-I PPC and sentenced to 
pay Daman Rs.1,00,000/- to injured Ghulam Farid.  
10. 
As regards the conviction under section 324 PPC is concerned, it 
is observed that section 324 PPC is attracted only in case of attempt to 
commit qatl-i-amd but when there is no evidence of intention or 
knowledge, question of attempt to commit qatl-i-amd does not arise. 
Since there was no intention of the petitioner in causing injuries, 
therefore, in the absence of intention, section 324 PPC would not be 
attracted, thus, the conviction under section 324 PPC and also the 
sentence recorded thereunder are set aside.  
11. 
As regards the conviction under section 334 PPC, though itlaf-i-
udw was result of injury but when it is caused by mistake, offender is 
liable only to Arsh for the injury under section 337-I of PPC. Thus, 
conviction and sentence against the petitioner imposed by the trial Court 
under section 334 PPC is set aside and accused/petitioner is convicted 
u/s 337-I PPC and sentenced to Arsh of Rs.5,47,408/- liable under 
section 334 PPC for payment to the injured Muhammad Arshad. As per 
jail report petitioner has already paid the amount of Daman and Arsh as 
mentioned above, therefore, there is no need to send the petitioner 
behind the bars for recovery thereof.  
12. 
So far as the conviction and sentence under Article 155 (1) (c) of 
Police Order, 2002 is concerned, Article 155 (2) of the said Order 

 
Crl. Rev. No.340 of 2013.  
7 
 
requires sanction of prosecution for trial of such offence which sanction 
is also missing in this case, therefore, it was not incumbent upon learned 
trial court to try such offence and to pass sentence, therefore, conviction 
and sentence under Article 155 (1) (c) of Police Order, 2002 are also set 
aside.    
13.  The contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that petitioner 
was in police service before the occurrence and upon his conviction he 
has been removed from service in his absence without waiting for 
outcome of this criminal revision, therefore, he may be reinstated into 
service because no imprisonment has been awarded to him which could 
stand in his way to reinstatement into service. Though no order can be 
passed in the present proceedings but for clarity of legal position, it is 
necessary to dilate upon this issue which arises almost in like cases when 
the offence is committed by a government service and upon conviction, 
he is removed from the service straight away without adverting to spirit 
of law and discretion vest upon the authorities under the relevant law.  
14.    Though primarily Police Rules are applicable for an action against 
the delinquent police officer of any rank, yet by the promulgation of 
Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006 
(PEEDA, 2006), the inquiry was being conducted against the police 
officers/officials under said Act till year 2012, but later by amendment 
its application on police employees was restricted. However, both 
regimes are being discussed.  
 
Rule.16.1 (1) of Police Rules, 1934 says that no police officer shall be 
departmentally punished otherwise than as provided in these rules; 
whereas sub-rule (2) mentions the authorities competent to inflict 
punishments on officers of the various ranks in tabulated form with 
following authorized punishments;  
i. Dismissal 
ii. Reduction in rank 
iii. Stoppage of increment or forfeiture of approved service for increment  
iv. Entry of censure 
v. Confinement to quarters 
vi. Extra guard fatigue or other duty 
vii. Punishment drill 

 
Crl. Rev. No.340 of 2013.  
8 
 
Punishment for dismissal can only be passed keeping in view the 
following rules of Chapter XVI of Police Rules, 1934; 
16.2          Dismissal—Dismissal shall be awarded only for the 
gravest acts of misconduct or as the cumulative effect of 
continued misconduct proving incorrigibility and complete 
unfitness for police service.  In making such an award regard shall 
be had to the length of service of the offender and his claim to 
pension. 
(2) an enrolled police officer sentenced judicially to rigorous 
imprisonment exceeding one month or to any other punishment 
not less severe, shall, if such sentence is not quashed on appeal or 
revision, be dismissed. An enrolled police officer sentenced by 
a criminal court to a punishment of fine or simply imprisonment, or 
both or to rigorous imprisonment not exceeding one month, or 
who, having been proclaimed under Section 87 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure fails to appear within the statutory period of 
thirty days may be dismissed or otherwise dealt with at the 
discretion of the officer empowered to appoint him. Final 
departmental orders in such cases shall be postponed until the 
appeal or revision proceedings have been decided, or until the 
period allowed for filling an appeal has lapsed without appellate or 
reversionary proceedings having been instituted. Departmental 
punishments under this rule shall be awarded in accordance with 
the powers conferred by rule 16.1. 
                                                           (Emphasize supplied)  
 
The above rules clearly indicate that authority is clutched only if judicial 
sentence exceeds one month’s imprisonment otherwise it is discretionary 
with the authority to go for dismissal or award a lesser sentence.  
15.   Awarding of punishment even on judicial sentence is not an 
automatic phenomenon rather a departmental inquiry is must and 
procedure is explained in Rule 16.24; conclusion of departmental inquiry 
is subject to decision on review under Rule 16.28 or on appeal under 
Rule 16.29. Even otherwise Rule 16.2 (2) above does not require to 
impose punishment if the civil servant is convicted rather it is the 
sentence that decides taking of departmental action and there is 
difference between conviction and sentence. Such rule authorizes 
infliction of punishment of dismissal only if the police officer is 
sentenced to rigorous imprisonment exceeding one month or to any other 
punishment not less severe. But in this case, petitioner has been finally 
sentenced to Arsh and Daman which are compensatory punishments. 
Therefore, under the Police Rules he should not have been dismissed 

 
Crl. Rev. No.340 of 2013.  
9 
 
from service but this situation could only be attended after departmental 
inquiry.   
 
16.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has informed that the petitioner 
has been removed from service under Punjab Employees Efficiency, 
Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006 (PEEDA, Act 2006) after his 
conviction by the learned trial court. It is observed that PEEDA Act, 
2006 is not applicable now on employees in police service. According to 
Section 1 (4) of PEEDA Act, 2006, it is applicable on followings; 
 
      (4)  It shall apply to– 
               (i)   employees in government service; 
              (ii)   employees in corporation service; and 
             (iii)   retired employees of government and corporation service; 
provided that proceedings under this Act are initiated 
against them during their service or within one year of 
their retirement. 
 
And “employee in government service” is defined in the said Act in 
Section 
2(h) 
but 
later 
its 
clause 
(ii) 
was 
substituted 
by 
the Punjab Employees 
Efficiency, 
Discipline 
and 
Accountability 
(Amendment) Act 2012 (XLVI of 2012) as under; 
                 (ii)   in Government service or who is a member of a civil 
service of the province or who holds a civil post in 
connection with the affairs of the province or any 
employee serving in any court or tribunal set up or 
established by the Government but does not include– 
 
                         (aa)   a Judge of the Lahore High Court or any 
court subordinate to that Court or an employee of 
such courts; and 
 
                             (bb)   an employee of Police.] 
 
Even otherwise under such Act, dismissal from service is not mandatory 
on conviction in all types of offences. Relevant section is reproduced; 
 
8.   Action in case of conviction or plea bargain under any law: –
 Where an employee is convicted by a court of law or has entered 
into plea bargain or has been acquitted by a court of law as a result of 
compounding of an offence involving moral turpitude or affecting 
human body under any law for the time being in force, the competent 
authority, after examining facts of the case, shall– 
 
(a)  dismiss the employee, where he has been convicted of 
charges of corruption or has entered into plea bargain and has 
returned the assets or gains acquired through corruption or 
corrupt practices voluntarily; or 
 

 
Crl. Rev. No.340 of 2013.  
10 
 
(b) proceed against the employee under section 7, where he has 
been convicted of charges other than corruption; or 
 
(c)  proceed against the employee under section 9, where he has 
been acquitted by a court of law as a result of compounding 
of an offence involving moral turpitude or affecting human 
body. 
 
As per clause (a) above, dismissal on conviction is only for offence of 
corruption etc. whereas for all other offences action under sections  7 or 
9 of the Act is mandatory. Section-9 regulates the process of imposition 
of penalty after regular inquiry whereas section 7 though authorizes the 
authority to dispense with conduct of an inquiry and pass sentence after 
giving a show cause notice, yet it says that it must be in the presence of 
accused civil servant and in said eventuality authority can impose any 
one or more penalties mentioned in section 4; which makes it clear that 
penalty of dismissal from service is not mandatory in every situation. 
Authority can exercise discretion keeping in view the nature of 
allegations, past conduct of police official and length of service.  
 
This expression has also a support from excerpts of Rule 7.5 of Civil 
Service Rules (Punjab) Volume-I which is reproduced for reference; 
 
In other cases, the authority shall decide as to whether any 
penalty should follow as a result of the decision of the case and 
if so, he may be punished in accordance with the Rules 
applicable to him and punishment should be ordered with 
retrospective effect from the date of trial court’s order of 
conviction. If the authority decides not to impose any penalty 
the government servant shall be deemed to be on extra 
ordinary leave for the period he was unable to perform his 
functions as a result of his conviction by the trial court. 
 
                                                                   (Emphasize supplied) 
  
As held above, PEEDA Act, 2006 is not applicable on employees of 
Police, they obviously would be governed under Chapter-XVI of Police 
Rules, 1934 and when they are being dealt under such rules, above 
excerpts shall also be kept in the mind. It is concluded that if any order 
adverse to the interest of petitioner has been passed at his back, it can 
well be challenged under the law.                                                                     
17. 
The revision petition, however, is dismissed with modifications in 
conviction and sentence and observation made above. Case property, if 

 
Crl. Rev. No.340 of 2013.  
11 
 
any, be disposed of in accordance with law and record of learned trial 
court be sent back immediately.   
This 
judgment 
was 
pronounced on 10.05.2023 
and after dictating and 
preparing, it was signed 
on 06.06.2023.
