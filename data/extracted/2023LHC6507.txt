Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial court, the 
appellants, Abaid-ur-Rehman, Rehman Siddique, and Muhammad Bilal, have 
assailed their convictions through filing instant Criminal Appeal No.76964-J of 
2019 whereas the complainant being dissatisfied with the impugned judgment 
dated 22.08.2019, preferred a Criminal Revision No.59543 of 2019 for 
enhancement of sentence of the respondents No.1 to 3, from life imprisonment 
to capital punishment. As both matters arise from the same judgment, they are 
being disposed of through a single judgment.   
3. 
 
The prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex.PA/1) lodged on 
the complaint (Ex.PA) of Naz Parveen (PW-13)-the complainant is that on 
22.01.2019, at about 02:00 p.m. complainant’s son namely Faisal Ali (since 
dead) went out of the house and did not return after that, the complainant (PW-
13) sent her Bhanja and nephew, Wajahat Anwar and Muhammad Shahid-PWs 
in search of her son and when they reached the house of accused Abaid-ur-
Rehman, the prosecution witnesses, Wajahat Anwar and Muhammad Shahid 
were made hostages on gunpoint and detained in a room, where Faisal Ali (since 
dead) was already detained, who told them (Wajahat Anwar and Muhammad 
Shahid-eye witnesses) that the accused persons had abducted him from railway 
station, at about 5:00 p.m.  The accused persons were demanding 
Rs.1,000,0000/- as ransom, and when he, Faisal Ali (since dead) tried to escape, 
the accused persons inflicted butt blows on his head. Later on, the accused, 
Abaid-ur-Rehman, made two fire shots with his pistol, which hit the left side of 
the waist of Faisal Ali (since dead), whereas the accused, Rehman, also made a

fire shot, which landed at the right side of the waist of Faisal Ali (since dead),

postmortem examination on the body of the deceased, Faisal Ali, and found the 
following injuries on his person: -

After conducting the postmortem examination, the doctor rendered 
the following opinion: - 
OPINION 
“All injuries were ante-mortem in nature. Injuries 
No.6, 7, and 8 were caused by firearm and main 
injuries, damaging the vital organs and massive loss 
of blood, leading to shock and cardiopulmonary 
arrest, which is sufficient to cause death in the 
ordinary course of nature.  
The probable time that elapsed between injuries and 
death was kept under observation, which he declared 
after going through the relevant reports as within one 
hour, and the time that elapsed between death and 
postmortem was 12 to 14 hours.”  
Ex. PT is the correct carbon copy of the postmortem 
report, whereas Ex.PT/1 and Ex.PT/2 are pictorial 
diagrams of injuries.

The statements of the remaining prosecution witnesses are formal.

The learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up Zaheer 
Abbas, Tariq Mehmood 290/C, Maqsood 296/HC, Muhammad Farooq being 
unnecessary and closed the prosecution evidence on 10.07.2019 after tendering 
the reports of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Ex. PV, Ex. PW, Ex. 
PX and Ex.PY).   
9. 
 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the appellants were 
examined under Section 342 of Cr.P.C., wherein they refused to appear as their 
own witnesses in terms of Section 340 (2) Cr.P.C., in proof of the allegations 
leveled against them, but each of the appellants opted to produce defense 
evidence. In response to a particular question that why this case was against 
them and why the PWs had deposed against them, Abaid-ur-Rehman, Rehman 
Siddique, and Muhammad Bilal-appellants made the following depositions: - 
“I am innocent. It was an unseen and dark night 
occurrence and same was not witnessed by anyone. I 
neither abducted Faisal Ali (deceased) nor demand 
any ransom. In fact, officials of Rescue 1122 Sialkot 
recovered the dead body of Faisal Ali from said 
canal and handed over the same to Faiz Ahmad, S.I 
of Police Station, Sambrial. Complainant in 
consultation with witnesses maneuvered a false story 
of kidnapping and murder of deceased and 
thereafter, falsely implicated me in this case due to 
suspicions and surmises. PWs deposed against them 
being closely relatives of the complainant.”  
 
 
Irfan Yaoob, In-charge Control Room, Rescue 1122, Sialkot, 
appeared as DW-1. In documentary evidence, the appellant, Abaid-ur-Rehman, 
tendered an electronic copy of “Urdu Point” (Ex. DC) (under objection) and 
closed the defense evidence on 15.07.2019.  
10. 
 
After evaluating the evidence available on record in the light of 
arguments advanced from both sides, the learned trial court found the 
prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, resulting in 
the appellants' conviction in the afore-stated terms.

We have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for 
the parties and have minutely perused the record on the file. 
12. 
 
According to the prosecution, the occurrence occurred at 5.00 p.m. 
on 22.01.2019 and falls within the jurisdiction of police station Kotwali, whereas 
the incident was reported to the police on 23.01.2019 at 02:00 p.m. by Naz 
Parween (PW-13)-the complainant, mother of Faisal Ali (deceased). The police 
station is one kilometer from the house of Naaz Parween (PW-13)-the 
complainant. Naz Parween (PW-13) reported the incident at the police station 
through the written complaint (Ex. PA), and FIR (Ex.PA/1) was computerized 
by Zeshan Muzamal T/ASI (PW-1) through the POLCOM operator. Naz 
Parween (PW-13)-the complainant mentioned in the written complaint (Ex. PA) 
and FIR (Ex. PA/1) that yesterday, i.e., 22.01.2019 at around 02:00 p.m., her son 
left the house and did not return till around 05:00 p.m., when she called her 
son’s cell phone, the son’s number was being switched off. After that, Wajahat 
Anwar (PW-11), the complainant’s sister’s son, and Muhammad Shahid (PW-
12), the complainant’s brother’s son, went out for searching her son Faisal Ali. 
Who also did not make the phone call to the complainant and other relatives 
after 05:30 p.m. on 22.01.2019 in the evening. The complainant and other 
relatives became helpless to search for her son in the city. Later on, on 
23.01.2019 at around 12:00 noon, Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and Muhammad 
Shahid (PW-12) reached the complainant’s house worried and unwell, who told 
the complainant that they had gone to the house of Abaid-ur-Rehman last 
evening at 05:30 p.m. in search of complainant’s son. Abaid-ur-Rehman, along 
with the accused Rehman and Muhammad Bilal, also locked them in their house 
at gunpoint and, on seeing them, the complainant’s son told them that at around 
05:00 in the evening, they abducted him in their car from the front of the railway 
station at gunpoint and the accused has locked him in the house of Abaid-ur-
Rehman. They were demanding one crore rupees for his release. Later, Faisal 
Ali tried to secure himself from the clutches of the accused persons, and the 
accused persons inflicted the butt of their pistols which hit the head of the 
complainant's son. Then, the accused, Abaid-ur-Rehman, fired two shots from 
his pistol, which hit Faisal Ali on the left side of his back. Faisal Ali died after 

Crl. Appeal No.76964-J of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.59543 of 2019

being beaten. Later, at 11:00 p.m., the accused put the body of the complainant’s 
son in the car and took it somewhere while the accused, Rehman, kept watching 
over him at home. On 23.01.2019. at around 12:00 p.m., some people knocked 
on the door of the house of the accused, Abaid-ur-Rehman, but the accused, 
Rahman, did not open the door. Later, in frustration, the accused, Rehman, 
escaped from the spot by locking the door from outside. The complainant’s 
sister’s son and brother’s son made hue and cry, and unknown persons broke the 
door, and they reached the complainant’s house after saving their lives. 
Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) deposed during cross-examination that when he 
received the information about the missing of Faisal Ali (deceased) through the 
complainant, he informed 15. However, the record of 15 calls was not secured 
by the police nor produced by the prosecution. Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) stated 
that he did not inform the police about the missing of Faisal Ali (deceased) when 
he left the house of the complainant for the search of Faisal Ali. However, the 
police station is at a distance of one kilometer. Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) deposed 
during cross-examination, “On 22.01.2019, I came to know about missing of 
Faisal Ali (deceased) at 5.00 PM. Volunteers, this fact was told to me by 
complainant as I was present in her house, at that time. I had reached house 
of complainant at 5.00 PM, on that day. I proceeded from my residence to 
the house of complainant, on that day. I got free from my business at 3.00 
PM, on that day. The moment, I came to know about missing of Faisal Ali 
(deceased), we departed from the house of complainant on that day. Faisal 
Ali (deceased) was a tutor. He used to do tuition at an academy and was not 
a home tutor. The said academy was in his name and was situated in 
Factory Area, Sialkot. On 22.01.2019, we did not go to said academy. We 
did not contact any employee of said academy. Volunteers, on that day, we 
contacted accused Abaid ur Rehman, who used to run said academy in 
absence of deceased. I contacted said accused through cell phone. The cell 
phone of said accused was not available with me on that day. Volunteers, I 
obtained the same from complainant. I obtained cell phone of accused 
Abaid ur Rehman from complainant, at her house, on that day. I did not 
tell this fact to the police, during investigation. ---------- On coming to know 
about missing of Faisal Ali (deceased) on 22.01.2019 through complainant, I 

Crl. Appeal No.76964-J of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.59543 of 2019 
 
9
did not inform the police.” Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) deposed during cross-
examination that, “I reside in Mohallah Deputy Bagh, Sialkot. I reside in the 
house of Faisal Ali (deceased). ------------ Faisal Ali (deceased) was tutor and 
had academy with his name situated at Shahab Pura. Faisal Ali (deceased) 
had no specific time for attending academy. Volunteers, he also tutored in 
his house. Faisal Ali (deceased) was also a home tutor. He used to visit 8/10 
houses for the said purpose. I do not know the names of owners of houses, 
in which Faisal Ali (deceased) used to visit for tuition. Faisal Ali (deceased) 
was the only tutor of his academy. --------- I received information of missing 
of Faisal Ali (deceased) at about 5.00 PM and I was informed by 
complainant. I did not inquire from the complainant the routine arrival of 
Faisal Ali (deceased) in his house after tuition work. I also did not inquire 
from the complainant that in whose house deceased used to visit for 
tuition.” Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) resides in the complainant's house, but he 
was not aware of the timing of the arrival of Faisal Ali (deceased), nor did he 
inquire from the complainant. The prosecution has not brought on the record any 
evidence revealing that Faisal Ali (deceased) was the tutor and had an academy 
with his name situated at Shahab Pura or Factory Area, Sialkot. Both 
prosecution witnesses, i.e., PW-11 and PW-12, admitted during cross-
examination that when they returned after being released from the house of the 
accused-Abaid-ur-Rehman situated at Khadim Ali Road, Gali School Wali, 
Sialkot, to the house of the complainant their close relatives and dear ones were 
present there, but they did not report the missing of them along with Faisal Ali 
(deceased) to police. There is no explanation regarding the delay in lodging the 
FIR. Besides, during examination-in-chief, Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) deposed, “I 
and PW Muhammad Shahid went to the house of Mst. Naz Parveen and 
narrated the whole incident to her.” Similarly, Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) 
deposed during his testimony. During cross-examination, Wajahat Anwar (PW-
11) deposed, “We got drafted application through computer from my 
brother Muhammad Ahmad, for lodging report of the occurrence. On 
23.01.2019, after reaching complainant’s house, we left for Police Station 
and reached there at about 1.45/2.00 PM and remained present at said 
Police Station for about 15/20 minutes and from there, we did not proceed 

Crl. Appeal No.76964-J of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.59543 of 2019 
 
10 
to our house.” Whereas, Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) deposed during cross-
examination that, “We left the house of complainant for registration of case 
at about 2.00 P.M. The nephew of the mother of Faisal Ali (deceased) 
drafted application for registration of the case. Volunteers, his name is 
Ahmad. The said Ahmad is under Metric. We stayed at Police Station for 
35 minutes.”  Naz Perveen (PW-13), the complainant, deposed in examination-
in-chief that, “I filed an application Ex. PA for registration of the case, 
which bears my signature.” An entire criminal case depends on the first 
information rendered through a complaint before the police, and the entire 
evidence depends on said document. The complainant (PW-13), as per the 
complaint (Ex. PA), went to the police station to report the incident, but before 
visiting the police station, Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and Muhammad Shahid 
(PW-12) deposed that the complainant’s nephew "Muhammad Ahmad," 
prepared the application for the registration of a criminal case on the computer 
which was presented before the police. Non-mentioning this fact in the 
application/complaint (Ex. PA) indicates that Naz Perveen (PW-13)-the 
complainant, had not stated the complete truth and that the F.I.R. came into 
existence after due deliberations and consultations.  The author of the complaint 
(Exh. PA) should have stated that they prepared the complaint under the 
instructions of the complainant. It is also not a case of the prosecution that Naz 
Perveen (PW-13)-the complainant, asked Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and 
Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) to prepare a complaint and accordingly, the 
complaint was prepared by "Muhammad Ahmad," which was read over to the 
complainant and after that she (PW-13) signed the complaint. Even the 
complainant (PW-13) had not stated the preparation of the complaint in the 
complaint (Ex. PA) and her statement before the trial court; therefore, in these 
circumstances, the chance of consultations and deliberations on the part of the 
complainant (PW-13), cannot be ruled out. However, it is obligatory on the part 
of the court to take notice of the delay and examine in the backdrop of the case 
whether the prosecution has offered any acceptable explanation and, if such an 
explanation has been offered, whether the same deserves acceptance being found 
to be satisfactory. Let us analyze the prosecution evidence to see whether the 

Crl. Appeal No.76964-J of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.59543 of 2019 
 
11 
prosecution has proved its case that the accused persons-appellants abducted for 
ransom and committed the offence of murder of Faisal Ali. 
13. 
 
We have gone through the evidence produced by the prosecution. 
The prosecution case is that Faisal Ali (deceased) was first abducted for ransom 
and then assaulted at the rented premises of the accused-appellant Abaid-ur-
Rehman situated at Khadim Ali Road, Gali School Wali, Sialkot, and 
subsequently, he was killed and his dead body was thrown in Upper Chanab, 
Pull Nehar Malkhanwala Canal. None of the witnesses stated that at the relevant 
time and relevant date, they had seen the accused-appellants at “Front of 
Railway Road,” where Faisal Ali (deceased) was abducted. The prosecution put 
reliance on the statements of Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and Muhammad Shahid 
(PW-12) that they informed Naz Perveen (PW-13), the complainant and mother 
of the deceased, that “Faisal Ali (deceased) stated to the PWs that he was 
abducted at about 5.00 PM, in front of Railway Road, by accused persons 
Abaid ur Rehman, Muhammad Bilal and Rehman and they demanded Rs. 
1 Crore for his release.” Naz Perveen (PW-13), the complainant, deposed 
about the abduction of her son, Faisal Ali, from the front of the Railway Road on 
the information given to her by Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and Muhammad 
Shahid (PW-12). Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) 
were the prime witnesses in the case of Faisal Ali’s abduction for ransom and 
murder. They had deposed in court, alleging that the accused-appellants were 
responsible for the abduction for ransom and murder of Faisal Ali. Wajahat Ali 
(PW-11) deposed during examination-in-chief that, “Faisal Ali (deceased) 
stated to us that he was abducted at about 5.00 PM, in front of Railway 
Road, by accused persons Abaid ur Rehman, Muhammad Bilal and 
Rehman (present in court) and they demanded Rs. 1 Crore for his release. 
On resistance of Faisal Ali (deceased), accused persons gave butt blows at 
his head ---------” Similarly, Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) deposed during his 
testimony. The fact that Faisal Ali (deceased) was abducted from the front of the 
Railway Road was not verified during the investigation. Muhammad Arif 
Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating officer admitted during cross-examination, 
“I did not verify the factum of abduction of Faisal Ali (deceased) from 

Crl. Appeal No.76964-J of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.59543 of 2019 
 
12 
neighboring shop keepers. Vounteers, I called 2/3 shop-keepers to associate 
them in the said proceedings but they refused to do so. I did not mention 
this fact in my case diary. I did not verify above mentioned factum of 
abduction from the vicinity of Railway Station from 23.01.2019 to onward 
till the submission.”  So, the first part of the occurrence relates to the abduction 
of Faisal Ali (deceased) on 22.01.2019 at 05:00 p.m. from the front of Railway 
Road could not be verified. No incriminating material was found from the first 
place of occurrence. Besides, Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the 
investigating officer, deposed that he summoned the draftsman Mirza Tahir 
Tasleem (PW-3) on 25.01.2019. He visited the place of abduction of Faisal Ali 
(deceased) situated at Band Gali, Mohallah Deputy Bagh Sialkot, Railway Road 
near Railway Station Sialkot. He took rough notes on the pointing of Wajahat 
Anwar (PW-11), Muhammad Shahid (PW-12), and Naz Perveen (PW-13), the 
complainant. It is relevant to mention here that the place of abduction, allegedly 
told by Faisal Ali (deceased), is at a distance of one kilometer from the house of 
the deceased/complainant. During cross-examination, Wajahat Ali (PW-11) 
deposed that “Railway Station, Sialkot is surrounded by busy commercial 
area comprising many shops.” It is an admitted fact that Wajahat Anwar (PW-
11), Muhammad Shahid (PW-12), and Naz Perveen (PW-13), the complainant, 
were not witnesses of the abduction of Faisal Ali (deceased). So, the site plan 
(Ex. PC) prepared by Mirza Tahir Tasleem (PW-3) on the pointing of the place 
of abduction with details of the positions of accused persons by Wajahat Anwar 
(PW-11), Muhammad Shahid (PW-12), and Naz Perveen (PW-13), the 
complainant is irrelevant. The statements of Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and 
Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) that Faisal Ali (deceased) told them that the 
accused persons abducted him from the front of the Railway Station are not 
admissible in evidence. The same are unreliable, unbelievable, and 
untrustworthy for it to be considered substantive evidence.

Per the prosecution evidence, the complainant’s son, Faisal Ali, 
went missing at about 05:00 p.m. on 22.01.2019. At 05:30 p.m., Wajahat Anwar 
(PW-11) and Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) reached the house of the accused-
Abaid-ur-Rehman situated at Khadim Ali Road, Gali School Wali, Sialkot, in 

Crl. Appeal No.76964-J of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.59543 of 2019

search of Faisal Ali (deceased). The accused persons-appellants assaulted and 
killed Faisal Ali, and at 11:00 p.m., the accused put the body of the 
complainant’s son in the car and took it somewhere. The accused persons, the 
appellants, in the rented premises of Abaid-ur-Rehman, detained Wajahat Anwar 
(PW-11) and Muhammad Shahid (PW-12). Unknown persons released them at 
12:00 noon by breaking the lock of the door of the house of accused-Abaid-ur-
Rehman. Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) went to the 
house of the complainant. They told her about the incident, drafted the 
application for registration of the case, and went to the police station at 
01:45/2:00 p.m. to report the incident. The formal FIR was got computerized 
(Ex.PA/1) by Zeeshan Muzammil T/ASI (PW-1), chalked out through the 
POLCOM operator (not produced as a witness) at 02:35 p.m. Muhammad Arif 
Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating office deposed during examination-in-chief 
that, “On 23.01.2019, I was posted as Incharge, Homicide Investigation Unit, 
City Circle, Sialkot. On the same day, investigation of this case was 
entrusted to me. I alongwith Muhammad Sarwar, Muhammad Afzal, 
Maqsood Ahmad and Tayyab Ali constables reached the place of abduction 
i.e. Railway Road near Railway Station in the area of P.S Kotwali, Sialkot, 
by official vehicle bearing registration No.STG-14, driven by Muhammad 
Arif 226/DC, where Muhammad Riaz Dar Inspector/SHO, Police Station 
Kotwali alongwith complainant Naz Parveen and PWs Wajahat Anwar, 
Muhammad Shahid were present. I associated them with investigation and 
recorded statements u/s 161 Cr.P.C of above said PWs and supplementary 
statement of complainant. I inspected the place of abduction and on the 
pointation of PWs, prepared rough site plan Ex.PO thereof. Thereafter, I 
searched for accused persons. On receipt of spy information, I apprehended 
accused Abaid ur Rehman (present in court) from Greenwood Street, 
Sialkot, interrogated him and caused his formal arrest, who during 
interrogation in presence of said PWs, made disclosure and he could get 
recovered dead body of deceased Faisal Ali. After said disclosure, I firstly 
took said accused to the place of murder i.e. rented house of accused Abaid 
ur Rehman where complainant alongwith PWs, police of Police Station 
Kotwali and P.F.S.A team comprising Muhammad Rizwan Junior Scientist,

Crl. Revision No.59543 of 2019 
 
14 
who collected forensic evidence from the crime scene and made the same 
into eight sealed parcels and handed over the same to me------------” 
Contrary to the above deposition, Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the 
investigating office deposed during cross-examination that, “I straight away 
went to Greenwood Street from the place of abduction to arrest accused 
Abaid ur Rehman.--------------I arrested accused Abaid ur Rehman (present 
in court) from Greenwood Street, near Pakorra shop. I did not associate 
with investigation the persons of locality including owner of said Pakorra 
shop, at the time of arrest of accused Abaid ur Rehman. At the time of 
arrest of accused Abaid ur Rehman (present in court), SHO, Police Station 
Kotwali Sialkot was also present there beside the raiding party who came 
with me from Homicide Unit, City Circle Sialkot including eye-witnesses. I 
did not mention this fact in my case diary. From above mentioned place of 
arrest of accused Abaid ur Rehman, I straight away went to the place of 
murder of Faisal Ali (deceased) i.e. Mohallah Chah Lalariyan which falls 
within the territorial limits of Police Station Civil Line, Sialkot and is 
situated at a distance of about 1/ 1½  K.M from the place of arrest of 
accused Abaid ur Rehman.------------- When I reached at the place of 
murder, members of crime scene unit were not present there. Volunteers, 
they arrived there soon after my arrival. PWs Wajahat and Shahid were 
already present with me, at that time. I did not mention this fact in my case 
diary.” In all eventuality, as per the prosecution case, the dead body of Faisal 
Ali was recovered by Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating 
officer, who on the disclosure of the accused-Abaid-ur-Rehman reached the 
place of recovery of a dead body at about 05:00/05:15 p.m. on 23.01.2019. 
However, Rizwan Mehmood, Junior Forensic Scientist (PW-7), deposed during 
cross-examination that, “On 23.01.2019, I was on duty in second shift, which 
was from 3.00 PM to 11.00 PM. On the said date, I received call from D.P.O 
Office at 7.37 PM. I did not get mentioned the said time of receiving call in 
my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C.--------------After departing from our office, 
firstly, we went to Police Station Kotwali and then the police took us to the 
Crime Scene. I did not get mentioned this fact in my statement u/s 161 
Cr.P.C. We reached the Crime Scene at 9.18 PM, on that day.” From the 

Crl. Appeal No.76964-J of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.59543 of 2019 
 
15 
deposition of Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating officer 
reveals that before reaching the place of recovery of the dead body of Faisal Ali 
at about 05:00/05:15 p.m., he met with members of the Forensic Science Agency 
at the rented house of the accused-Abaid-ur-Rehman situated at Khadim Ali 
Road, Gali School Wali, Sialkot. Rizwan Mehmood, Junior Forensic Scientist 
(PW-7), stated that at 09:18 p.m. on 23.01.2019, the forensic team reached the 
place of the murder of Faisal Ali. This suggests that Muhammad Arif Inspector 
(PW-14)-the investigating officer, had deliberately concealed facts from the 
court.  
15. 
 
The other circumstance that throws a cloud of doubt on the 
testimony of the prosecution witnesses, including Muhammad Arif Inspector 
(PW-14)-the investigating office, is that he deposed that the dead body was got 
recovered by accused Abaid-ur-Rehman on 23.01.2019 at 5:00/5:15 p.m. 
Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating office deposed during 
cross-examination that, “One cannot reach at the gate of place of murder 
situated at Mohallah Chah Lalariyan, in four wheel vehicle.” Muhammad 
Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating office further deposed during cross-
examination that, “It took 3/4 hours in whole proceedings carried out at 
Upper Chenab Canal, Pull Malkhan Wala. I did not prepare relevant police 
papers at above mentioned place. Volunteers, I prepared police papers at 
Allama Iqbal Hospital, Sialkot.-------------------I prepared injury statement 
Ex.PQ and inquest report Ex.PR after midnight. Column No.2 of inquest 
report is over written. Volunteers, the same was corrected due to clerical 
mistake. I have not mentioned the corresponding hole upon clothes 
mentioned in column No.7 of inquest report Ex.PQ.”  Wajahat Anwar (PW-
11) deposed during examination-in-chief that, “On the same day i.e. 
23.01.2019, I and PW Muhammad Shahid joined the investigation. In our 
presence, accused Abaid ur Rehman (present in court) in custody, got 
recovered dead body of deceased Faisal Ali from Canal of Upper Chenab, 
Pull Nehar Malkhan Wala. I and PW Muhammad Shahid identified dead 
body of deceased Faisal Ali. I.O prepared identification memo Ex.PM, 
which was attested by me and PW Muhammad Shahid.” Similarly 

Crl. Appeal No.76964-J of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.59543 of 2019 
 
16 
Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) deposed during examination-in-chief. Wajahat 
Anwar (PW-11) also deposed during examination-in-chief that, “I alongwith 
PW Shahid escorted the dead body of deceased to Civil Hospital Sialkot and 
remained for 3/4 minutes at said hospital.” It has been noticed that in the 
inquest report (Ex. PQ) even the names of Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and 
Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) have not been mentioned. The inquest report of 
Faisal Ali (Ex. PR), if prepared after registration of the FIR and the investigating 
officer (PW-14) met with the complainant (PW-13), Wajahat Anwar (PW-11), 
and Muhammad Shahid (PW-12), and they identified the dead body at the place 
of recovery of dead body, there is no reason that why the details which we have 
found missing from the inquest report of Faisal Ali (Ex. PR) should not have 
been there. Besides, FIR (Ex. PA/1) was lodged at 02:35 p.m. on 23.01.2019. In 
the column No.3 of the inquest report (Ex. PR), the timing and date regarding 
receiving information of the incident is mentioned at 2:00 p.m. on 23.01.2019. 
On the last page of the inquest report (Ex. PR), the date of preparation was 
mentioned as 24.01.2019, whereas the column relating to the place where the 
inquest report was prepared was left blank. In addition, there is cutting and 
overwriting in column No.2 regarding the place where the dead body was 
recovered, creating doubt about the time of reporting the incident. The absence 
of those details is indicative of the fact that the prosecution story was still in the 
embryo and had not been given any shape and that the FIR was recorded later on 
after due deliberations and consultations and was then ante-timed to provide it 
with the colour of a promptly lodged FIR. At the bottom of the column of the 
brief history of the inquest report of Faisal Ali (Ex. PR), it was mentioned as 
under: -

Interestingly, as per the prosecution case, Muhammad Arif 
Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating officer had stated that on 23.01.2019, the 
accused Abaid-ur-Rehman led to recover the dead body of Faisal Ali from 
Upper Chanab, Pull Nehar Malkhanwala Canal at 05:00/05:15 p.m. on 
23.01.2019. The column of brief facts does not mention that the appellant-
accused Abaid-ur-Rehman got recovered the dead body. Further, as per the 
postmortem report (Ex. PT) and Dr. Zafar Iqbal (PW-15), police papers were 
received in the hospital on 24.01.2023 at 03:30 AM, though the dead body was 
received a day earlier, i.e., on 23.01.2019 at 09:30 p.m. and the autopsy was 
conducted at 03:40 a.m. on 24.01.2019. Dr. Zafar Iqbal (PW-15) deposed during 
cross-examination, “The police papers were handed over to me 3.30 AM 
(night) on 24.01.2019. According to police papers, the dead body was 
reportedly found from Canal Upper Chenab near Police Station Ugoki, 
Sialkot” Dr. Zafar Iqbal (PW-15) also deposed during examination-in-chief that, 
“I did not find any piece of cloth/fabric while observing injuries No.6 & 7.” 
It creates doubt that the time of the alleged occurrence is not the same as stated 
by Wajahat Anwar (PW-11), Muhammad Shahid (PW-12), and Naz Perveen 
(PW-13)-the complainant. The prosecution witnesses, i.e., Wajahat Anwar (PW-
11) and Muhammad Shahid (PW-12), deposed that on 22.01.2019 at 11:00 p.m., 
the accused persons Abaid-ur-Rehman and Bilal took away the dead body of 
Faisal Ali, and the appellant-accused Abaid-ur-Rehman got recovered the dead 
body at 05:00/05:15 p.m. on 23.01.2019. Whereas, Dr. Zafar Iqbal (PW-15) 
deposed that the time lapse between the death and postmortem examination of 
the dead body was 12 to 14 hours. If we go backward from 03:40 a.m. on 
24.01.2019, the 12 to 14 hours would be between 3:40 p.m. to 1:40 p.m. on 
23.01.2019. This shows that death had not occurred as deposed by Wajahat 
Anwar (PW-11) and Muhammad Shahid (PW-12). We further noticed that Dr. 
Zafar Iqbal (PW-15), who conducted the postmortem examination, had noted 
that the duration between the injury and death is one hour. It indicated that the 
incident did not occur as stated by the prosecution. This also created doubt about 
the prosecution story and the time of occurrence.

Wajahat Anwar (PW-11), Muhammad Shahid (PW-12), and Naz 
Perveen (PW-13)-the complainant, have made dishonest improvements in their 
statement before the court. We straightway come to the material 
improvements/discrepancies/contradictions in the prosecution evidence brought 
on the record by the defence. Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) deposed during cross-
examination that “On seeing Faisal Ali (deceased) present in said house of 
accused Abaid ur Rehman, we did not raise hue & cry, at that time. We also 
did not raise hue & cry, at the time of occurrence of murder. Volunteers, we 
were at gun point, at that time. Accused Abaid ur Rehman was armed with 
gun, when he opened the door. I did not get this fact mentioned in my any 
statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C.------------------I do not remember whether I got 
mentioned that accused Rehman Siddique detained us on gun point whole 
the night. Confronted with Ex.DB where the fact of gun point is not 
mentioned. I got mentioned in my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C that on 
23.01.2019, accused Rehman made a telephonic call to Mst. Naz Parveen 
through cell phone of Faisal Ali (deceased) and demanded Rs.1 Crore as 
ransom. Confronted with Ex.DB where said date is not mentioned.” Naz 
Perveen (PW-13)-the complainant, deposed during cross-examination that “I 
had not seen the academy of my son (deceased). My son (deceased) was also 
a home tutor. He use to visit 5/6 houses in connection with Tuition. I did not 
inform to the Police Station regarding missing of my son (deceased), 
however, I told to the Wajahat and Shahid PWs on 22.01.2019. I had got 
mentioned in application Ex.PA that accused Rehman detained the PWs in 
the house on gun point whole the night confronted in Ex.P.A, where gun 
point is not mentioned. No other my statement was recorded by the police.” 
The prosecution failed to prove that the accused-appellants demanded ransom 
and kept Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) at gunpoint. The 
improvements and discrepancies in the evidence of Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and 
Naz Perveen (PW-13), the complainant, were material, and the same is enough 
proof for disbelieving and discrediting their evidence. In such circumstances, 
witnesses may not inspire confidence. If their evidence is found to be in conflict 
and contradiction with other evidence or with the statement already recorded, in 
such a case, it cannot be held that persecution proved its case beyond reasonable

doubt. Respectful reliance in this regard is placed on the judgment of the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Rafique and others  v.  
The State and others” (2010 SCMR 385), wherein it has been held as under: - 
“This Court in the case of Saeed Muhammad Shah v. 
State 1993 SCMR 550 observed that if a witness 
improves his statement on material aspects of the case 
then such improvement is not worthy of reliance and the 
evidence of such witness requires corroboration. In the 
case of Khalid Javed  v.  State 2003 SCMR 1419 while 
reiterating the above rule, it was further observed that 
such witness is to be considered to be wholly unreliable 
and it is not advisable to place explicit reliance upon his 
evidence.”   
 
 
The fact that Faisal Ali was murdered by the accused-appellants at 
the rented premises of Abaid-ur-Rehman situated at Khadim Ali Road, Gali 
School Wali, Sialkot, has been relied upon by the prosecution to show that 
Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) were eye-witnesses 
of the murder of Faisal Ali. After the murder of Faisal Ali by them on 
22.01.2019 at 11:00 p.m., the accused persons- appellants Abaid-ur-Rehman and 
Bilal, took the dead body of Faisal Ali (deceased) and went away by car, and the 
accused-appellant Abaid-ur-Rehman detained them. Wajahat Ali (PW-11) 
deposed during examination-in-chief that, “On resistance of Faisal Ali 
(deceased), accused persons gave butt blows at his head. Later on, accused 
Abaid ur Rehman made two fire shots with his pistol which hit on left side 
of waist of Faisal Ali (deceased). Accused Rehman also made fire shot with 
his pistol which also hit at the right side of waist of Faisal Ali (deceased) 
who died there. At about 11.00 PM, accused Abaid-ur-Rehman and Bilal 
took the dead body of deceased Faisal Ali and went away by a car.” 
Similarly, Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) deposed during his testimony. 
Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) deposed during cross-examination that, “The 
rented house of accused Abai ur Rehman is at a distance of ½ K.M from 
Khadim Ali Road. The vehicle cannot reach at the gate of above said house. 
The shops are situated on both the sides of said street and this street is busy 
one. The said shops are of surgical instruments and there is also factory of 
manufacturing surgical instruments. The said house is situated in the Abadi 

Crl. Appeal No.76964-J of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.59543 of 2019 
 
20 
and same is double storey. The ground floor and first floor are rented.” 
Contrary to the deposition of Muhammad Shahid (PW-12), Wajahat Ali (PW-
11) deposed during cross-examination that, “The said street is not such a busy 
public place. There is no shop of surgical instruments in the said street.” 
The witnesses examined by the prosecution tried to prove that Faisal Ali 
(deceased) was murdered at the rented premises of Abaid-ur-Rehman situated at 
Khadim Ali Road, Gali School Wali, Sialkot. After that, his dead body was 
shifted into the car, and after that, the dead body was thrown into Upper Chanab, 
Pull Nehar Malkhanwala Canal. During cross-examination, Wajahat Ali (PW-
11) said, “The house is double storey building. On ground floor of said 
house, some other tenant lives. Accused Abaid ur Rehman resides at first 
floor of said house. No other tenant lives on the first floor besides accused 
Abaid ur Rehman.” Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating 
Officer deposed during cross-examination that, “The place of murder i.e. 
rented house is a double story building. I do not know that owner of above 
mentioned house resides with his family at ground floor. First floor of above 
mentioned house is divided into two portions, in one portion, family of 
accused Abaid ur Rehman was residing and in other portion, another other 
family on rent was residing. I did not try to ascertain that who was actual 
owner of said house as well as tenant of other portion of upper storey of 
said house. I did not associate any neighbourer or Mohallah Dar of place of 
murder.”  Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating Officer also 
admitted during cross-examination that, “I did not verify the occurrence of 
murder from owner of said house as well as the tenant and neighbourers of 
said place, during my whole investigation.” Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-
14)-the investigating Officer further deposed during cross-examination that, “I 
have not collected the proof of ownership of house of murder. I also did not 
collect any rent deed of said house. I did not record any statement of any 
person of the locality to establish this fact that accused Abai ur Rehman 
was tenant of said house.”  The prosecution could not establish that Abaid-ur-
Rehman, the accused, resided at the rented premises at Khadim Ali Road, Gali 
School Wali, Sialkot. There is no proof that he owned the premises on rent.

Regarding the alleged recovery of black colored Toyota Corolla 
bearing registration No.LEB-13-3917 taken on rent by the appellant-accused 
Abaid-ur-Rehman on 22.01.2019 at 08:00 p.m. from Sultan Zaman (PW-4), 
owner of Al-Karam rent-a-car is concerned, Sultan Zaman (PW-4) deposed 
during examination-in-chief that, “On 22.01.2019, at 8.00 PM, my Mohallah 
Dar namely Abaid ur Rehman accused (present in court) alongwith my 
friend PW Shafique ul Imran as guarantor came at my said shop for 
obtaining car on rent by stating that accused Abaid ur Rehman and his 
friends had to attend a marriage ceremony within city Sialkot and rent was 
settled to the tune of Rs.2000/-. I received an amount of Rs.1000/- in 
advance and remaining amount Rs.1000/- would be treated as arrear.--------
------On 23.01.2019, PW Shafique ul Imran, guarantor returned the said car 
to me alongwith outstanding amount of Rs.1000/-.” Contrary to the deposition 
of Sultan Zaman (PW-4), Shafique-ul-Imran (PW-5) deposed during 
examination-in-chief that, “Prior to this, I often used to arrange car on rent 
for him. I settled rent of car for Rs.3000/-, with accused Abaid ur Rehman. I 
paid Rs.2000/- to PW sultan Zaman and kept Rs.1000/- with me as 
commission. I took black coloured Toyota Corolla car bearing registration 
No. LEB-13-3917 from Sultan Zaman and handed over to accused Abaid ur 
Rehman (present in court).” Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and Muhammad Shahid 
(PW-12) deposed that on 22.01.2019, they reached the rented house of Abaid-ur-
Rehman at 05:30 p.m., saw and met with Faisal Ali, the appellants killed Faisal 
Ali and the dead body was taken away at 11:00 p.m. on the same day. 
Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the Investigating Officer had not traced 
blood stains from the car. Besides, medical evidence reveals that Faisal Ali died 
between 1:40 p.m. and 3:40 p.m. on 23.01.2019. The prosecution failed to 
establish the link of the vehicle with the occurrence of abduction and shifting of 
the dead body of Faisal Ali. So, the recovery is of no avail to the prosecution 
case.

So far as the positive report of Forensic DNA and Serology 
Analysis report (Ex. PV/1-2) regarding the pieces of mattress, pieces of cloth, 
and bed sheet is concerned, during the investigation, Muhammad Arif Inspector 

Crl. Appeal No.76964-J of 2019 
Crl. Revision No.59543 of 2019 
 
22 
(PW-14)-the investigating Officer secured 08 sealed parcels prepared and 
collected by crime scene unit Gujranwala of Forensic Science Agency from the 
crime scene situated at the rented premises of Abaid-ur-Rehman situated at 
Khadim Ali Road, Gali School Wali, Sialkot. The prosecution evidence is silent 
about when, where, and by whom eight sealed parcels were handed over to 
Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the Investigating Officer, in the presence of 
Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and Muhammad Shahid (PW-12). Wajahat Anwar 
(PW-11) deposed during examination-in-chief that, “The member of crime 
scene also visited the spot and took into possession the different articles and 
made six parcels, which I.O took into possession vide recovery memo 
Ex.PL, which was attested by me and PW Muhammad Shahid.” Similarly, 
Muhammad Shahid (PW-12) deposed during examination-in-chief. The contents 
of the recovery memo (Ex. PL) reveal that eight sealed parcels were handed over 
to Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the Investigating Officer by the crime 
scene unit Gujranwala of Forensic Science Agency and same were deposited by 
him on 30.01.2019 with the Punjab Forensic Science Agency for analysis. There 
is a contradiction in the statements of Wajahat Anwar (PW-11) and Muhammad 
Shahid (PW-12) and between the contents of the recovery memo (Ex. PL), 
deposition of Rizwan Mehmood (PW-7) and Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-
14)-the Investigating Officer. Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the 
Investigating Officer prepared a recovery memo of secured 08 sealed parcels 
prepared and collected by crime scene unit Gujranwala of Forensic Science 
Agency from the crime scene situated at the rented premises of Abaid-ur-
Rehman on 23.01.2019 whereas same was handed over by him to Gulzar Ahmad 
1667/HC (PW-6)-the moharrar malkhana, on 24.01.2019. to Gulzar Ahmad 
1667/HC (PW-6)-the moharrar malkhana admitted during cross-examination 
that, “The aforementioned parcels were handed over to me by the said I.O, 
on 24.01.2019, at 12.15 AM (night). I entered rapt regarding receipt of said 
parcels in the daily register on the said date. I did not get mentioned the 
said rapt in my statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C, before the I.O.” Rizwan Mehmood 
(PW-7), Junior Forensic Scientist, has not deposed about the details of the 
evidence collected by crime scene unit Gujranwala of the Forensic Science 
Agency from the crime scene. Rizwan Mehmood (PW-7), Junior Forensic

Scientist, has not deposed about the details of the evidence collected by the 
crime scene unit Gujranwala of the Forensic Science Agency, nor did he state 
that he handed over the same to Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the 
Investigating Officer. It is admitted fact that the mattress was not secured by 
Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating Officer from the spot 
rather members of the Forensic Science Agency from the crime scene, including 
Rizwan Mehmood (PW-7) Junior Forensic Scientist, collected evidence from the 
alleged rented house of Abaid-ur-Rehman (the appellant) and handed over to 
Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the Investigating Officer. Muhammad Arif 
Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating Officer admitted during cross-examination 
that he had not shown any articles lying in the room where the murder of Faisal 
Ali (the deceased) took place. In this regard, Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-
14)-the investigating Officer, admitted during cross-examination that “I have 
not shown any household article in rough site plan Ex.PP.” Similarly, 
draftsman, Mirza Tahir Tasleem (PW-3), admitted that he had not shown the 
household articles in the site plan (Ex. PD and Ex, PD/1). In the un-scaled site 
plan (Ex. PP) prepared by Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the Investigating 
Officer, and the scaled site plan (Ex. PD and Ex, PD/1) prepared by Mirza Tahir 
Tasleem (PW-3)-draftsman the points where household articles, i.e., mattress, 
bed sheets were present. In this background, a positive report of Forensic DNA 
and Serology Analysis Report (Ex. PV/1-2) is of no consequence and could not 
be based for conviction.  
19. 
 
So far as recovery of the weapon of offence, i.e., pistol 30-bore (P-
6) alongwith three live bullets (P-7/1-3), from the possession of the appellant-
Abaid-ur-Rehman and positive report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency 
(Ex.PW/1-2), are concerned, as per the prosecution case, on 23.01.2019, the 
accused-Abaid-ur-Rehman was arrested from Greenwood Street, Sialkot and 
upon his disclosure, pistol 30-bore (P-6) and three live bullets (P-7/1-3) were 
recovered on 06.02.2019 and prepared recovery memo (Ex. PN). Muhammad 
Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating officer stated that on 23.01.2019, he 
secured 03 crime empties of pistol 30-bore (P-5/1-3) through recovery memo 
(Ex. PK), which were handed over to the Moharrar Malkhana 24.01.2019.

Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the investigating Officer deposed during his 
deposition before the recovery of the dead body at 05:00/5:30 p.m. on 
23.01.2019 the crime scene unit collected evidence and sealed in eight parcels, 
and after that, he collected 03 empties (P-5/1-3) of pistol 30 bore from the spot. 
Thereafter, the accused, Abaid-ur-Rehman, led to recover the dead body of 
Faisal Ali from Pull Nehar Malkhan Wala. Whereas, one of the members of the 
crime scene unit, Rizwan Mehmood (PW-7) Junior Forensic Scientist, deposed 
during cross-examination that, “We reached the Crime Scene at 9.18 PM, on 
that day”, which negates the deposition of Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-
the Investigating Officer that he reached the place of occurrence before 05:00 
p.m. on 23.01.2019 and completed the proceedings at the place where Faisal Ali 
was murdered and secured 03 empties (P-5/1-3) of pistol .30 bore from the spot. 
The sequence of events deposed by Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the 
Investigating Officer has not gotten support from the documentary evidence 
placed on the record as well as the deposition of prosecution witnesses. In the 
un-scaled site plan (Ex. PP) prepared by Muhammad Arif Inspector (PW-14)-the 
investigating Officer, and the scaled site plan (Ex. PD and Ex, PD/1) prepared 
by Mirza Tahir Tasleem (PW-3)-draftsman, the points where from the 
investigating officer secured crime empties have not been shown. Practically, the 
prosecution took upon itself the risk of losing the case. In our opinion, the 
inconsistencies above and the contradictions considered cumulatively lead to an 
irresistible inference that the prosecution has not been able to prove safe custody 
of the recovered substance through material and convincing evidence. In these 
circumstances, the Firearms & Toolmarks Examination Report (Ex. PW/1-2) is 
of no consequence. 
20. 
 
From the detailed discussion above, we are convinced that the 
prosecution has failed to establish its case.  The truth was seen buried under the 
debris, and a different story was structured perhaps to lug the appellants into trial 
under the serious offense.  It is often said “that Fouler the crime higher the 
decree of proof.” we have gone through the process of keen examination of the 
entire material and found compelling reasons, as stated above, to disgrace with 
the conclusion recorded by the learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court-II,

Crl. Revision No.59543 of 2019

Gujralwala and also found that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the 
guilt of the accused-appellants beyond reasonable doubt. Per the dictates of law, 
the benefit of every doubt will be extended in favor of the accused. In the case of 
“Muhammad Akram v. The State” (2009 SCMR 230), it is held as under: - 
“Benefit of doubt….Principles----For giving the benefit 
of doubt, it is not necessary that there should be many 
circumstances creating doubts----Single circumstance 
creating reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the 
guilt of the accused makes him entitled to its benefit, not 
as a matter of grace and concession, but as a matter of 
right”. 
21. 
 
We, therefore, accept in toto Criminal Appeal No.76964-J of 2019 
filed by the appellants-Abaid-ur-Rehman, Rehman Siddique and Muhammad 
Bilal; as a result, whereof conviction and sentence recorded by the trial Court 
vide judgment dated 22.08.2019 is set-aside, and the appellants are acquitted of 
the charge in case F.I.R. No.21/2019 dated 23.01.2019, offences under Sections 
302, 365-A, 201, 34 P.P.C. registered at Police Station Kotwali, District Sialkot. 
They (the appellants) are directed to be released forthwith, if not required in any 
other case. 
22. 
 
So far as Criminal Revision No.59543 of 2019 filed by the 
complainant, Mst. Naz Parveen for enhancement of sentence of the respondents 
No.1 to 3 awarded by the trial court is concerned, for the reasons afore-stated, 
the same is devoid of any legal force, which is accordingly dismissed.
