Muhammad Naeem 
Vs. Additional District Judge etc. 
 
              
Date of hearing 
25-11-2024 
Petitioner by 
Syed Muhammad Usman Hadi Bukhari, 
Advocate. 
Respondents No.3 & 
4 by 
Ms. Areesha Sajid, Advocate. 
 
ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. Through this Constitutional 
Petition the petitioner has challenged the impugned orders dated 
01.03.2021, 13.09.2021 & 18.09.2021 (impugned orders) passed by 
the Executing Court and the Appellate Court, whereby his Objection 
Petition against the attachment and auction of his immovable 
property was dismissed and the auction schedule was announced. 
2. 
Relevant facts are that contesting-respondents No.3 & 4 (wife 
& minor-daughter — contesting respondents) filed a family Suit for 
Dissolution of Marriage, Recovery of Dower, Dowry Articles and 
Maintenance Allowance (Suit) against respondent No.5/defendant 
(Muhammad Akbar). Respondent No.6 (Abdul Aziz) appeared on 
behalf of the defendant through Special Power-of-Attorney/Exh.D2 
(hereinafter referred to as Special Attorney). He contested the Suit 
by filing written-statement; however, the Suit was decreed on 
06.05.2015 against respondent No.5. During execution, the said 
decree could not be satisfied against respondent No.5/Judgment-
debtor (hereinafter referred to as Judgment-debtor), resultantly, the 
Special Attorney was sent to Civil Prison. The Petitioner stood 
Surety on behalf of Special Attorney by tendering his Surety Bond 
dated 31.05.2019 (Surety Bond). Subsequently, Petitioner’s 
immovable property, mentioned on the Surety Bond, was attached 
on account of failure to satisfy the decree by the Judgment-debtor 
and the Special Attorney. The Petitioner filed Objection Petition, 

[-2-] 
Writ Petition No.65675/2021 
 
 
 
 
 
which was however dismissed through the impugned order dated 
01.03.2021, which was assailed by the Petitioner in Appeal and his 
Appeal was also declined on 13.09.2024, thereafter, Petitioner’s 
attached immovable property was put to auction while announcing 
the auction schedule vide impugned order 18.09.2021; hence, this 
Constitutional Petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the decree was 
passed against the Judgment-debtor and not against the Special 
Attorney, hence, since the Petitioner stood Surety on behalf of the 
Special Attorney, his attached immovable property could not be put 
to auction for satisfaction of the decree. 
4. 
Learned counsel for contesting-respondents, on the other 
hand, supported the impugned orders and submits that the Petitioner 
executed Surety Bond on behalf of the Judgment-debtor and Special 
Attorney, therefore, his attached immovable property was lawfully 
put to auction for failure to satisfy the decree. She further submits 
that because respondents No.5 & 6 have common interest with the 
Petitioner and they are intentionally delaying this matter, therefore, 
this case may be decided on merits after hearing the contesting-
respondents. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Perusal of the record transpires that the Suit 
was filed by contesting-respondents against respondent No.5, which 
was decreed by the Trial Court on 06.05.2015. The Special Attorney 
on behalf of respondent No.5 was neither impleaded as defendant in 
the Suit nor the Suit was decreed against him, rather he appeared in 
the Court only in the capacity of Special Attorney on behalf of the 
Judgment-debtor. In absence of any decree against the Special 
Attorney or specific clause to this effect in Special Power-of-attorney 
(Exh.D2), the Executing Court could satisfy the decree only against 
the Judgment-debtor but not against the Special Attorney, who never 
appeared in the Suit in his personal capacity but only as Special 

[-3-] 
Writ Petition No.65675/2021 
 
 
 
 
 
Attorney of the Judgment-debtor. In the circumstances, order for 
arrest of the Special Attorney and sending him in Civil Prison for 
execution of the decree was not warranted in law. Consequently, the 
Surety Bond by the petitioner for release of Special Attorney was 
also neither required nor enforceable. 
6. 
The same view was also expressed by this Court in 
“Muhammad Aslam Vs. Ayyan Ghazanffar and 2 others” (PLD 2012 
Lahore 392), where it is held as under:- 
“12. Whenever the question of interpretation of Power 
of Attorney is considered, it is now a consensus on the 
point that deed of power of attorney is strictly to be 
construed and a power which has not been assigned in 
specific terms cannot be presumed to have been given by 
the principal to the attorney. The attorney in this case 
when extended the power to defend the suit on behalf of 
the defendant was never provided with any liability to the 
effect that in case of any possible decree against 
defendant/judgment debtor, the same can equally be 
executable against the attorney. Even in Muhammad 
Pervez’s case (Supra) the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan is of the view that it is the judgment debtor 
Fazal-e-Haq who is bound to satisfy the decree either 
himself or through attorney. Keeping in view such 
findings of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, the 
attorney in his independent capacity cannot be booked 
for satisfaction of decree which was never granted 
against him.” 
 
Same opinion was expressed by this Court in “Muhammad Nawazish 
Ali Vs. Family Judge and others” (2021 CLC 1841) in following 
words:- 
“27. The counsel for Respondents No.2 and 3 half-
heartedly attempted to argue that the decretal `amount 
payable to Respondent No.3 could be realized from the 
Petitioner as he was pursuing the cases on behalf of 
Sarfraz Hussain. This contention deserves a short shrift. 
The Petitioner is the special attorney of Sarfraz Hussain 

[-4-] 
Writ Petition No.65675/2021 
 
 
 
 
 
and never assumed any liability on his behalf. He neither 
posted surety bond nor otherwise gave an undertaking to 
the Court at any point of time for payment of any money.” 
 
The Islamabad High Court in “Muhammad Mohsin Fawad Vs. Hina 
Tayyaba Khalil and another” (2018 YLR 2199) reiterated this view 
as under:- 
“25. The fact remains that the petitioner is not the 
judgment debtor. The petitioner was not a party to the 
suit instituted by the respondents. The petitioner 
happened to be pursuing the case on behalf of Dr. 
Qureshi before the Courts. It is not disputed that the Plot 
was owned by the petitioner and not by Dr. Qureshi. 
Therefore, the decree dated 03.10.2014 could not be 
satisfied by attaching or selling the property which 
belonged to the petitioner. The said decree is to be 
executed against the judgment debtor i.e., Dr. Qureshi, 
and none other.” 
 
No doubt the Hon’ble Supreme Court in “Muhammad Pervez Vs. 
Mst. Nabila Yasmeen and 2 others” (2004 SCMR 1352) held that 
judgment debtor is bound to satisfy the decree either himself or 
through the attorney, however, in the present case it is not shown 
from the Special Power-of-Attorney (Exh.D2) that the Judgment-
debtor required the Special Attorney to burden the liability for 
satisfaction of decree. This legal position is also explained by this 
Court in the case of Muhammad Aslam, supra. 
7. 
From the above case law, there is no doubt that the Special 
Attorney was not liable for execution of the decree, consequently, 
the Surety Bond executed by the Petitioner for release of the Special 
Attorney cannot be made basis to attach his immoveable property for 
the satisfaction of decree. Though the Surety Bond is also on behalf 
of the Judgment-debtor besides the Special Attorney, however, when 
the Petitioner was not required at first place to execute the Surety 
Bond for release of Special Attorney, then the whole superstructure 
on the basis of illegal detention order will crumble down and 

[-5-] 
Writ Petition No.65675/2021 
 
 
 
 
 
Petitioner’s property cannot be auctioned merely because he 
mentioned the name of Judgment-debtor in his Surety Bond, which 
was not required to be executed at the first instance. 
8. 
There is a clear distinction between "surety" & "special-
attorney''; Rules 1 & 2 of Order III of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908 (CPC) deal with the Special Attorney. For convenience Rules 
1 & 2 of Order III of the CPC are reproduced hereunder:- 
“1. 
Appearances, etc., may be in person, by 
recognized agent or by pleader.– Any appearance, 
application or act in or to any Court, required or 
authorized by law to be made or done by a party in such 
Court, may, except where otherwise expressly provided 
by any law for the time being in force, be made or done 
by the party in person, or by his recognized agent, or by 
a pleader [appearing, applying or acting, as the case 
may be,] on his behalf: 
 
Provided that any such appearance shall, if the 
Court so directs, be made by the party in person. 
2. 
Recognized Agents.– The recognized agents of 
parties by whom such appearances, applications and 
acts may be made or done are— 
(a) 
persons 
holding 
powers-of-attorney, 
authorizing them to make and do such 
appearances, applications and acts on behalf of 
such parties; 
 
(b) persons carrying on trade or business for and 
in names of parties not resident within the local 
limits of the jurisdiction of the Court within which 
limits the appearance, application or act is made 
or done, in matters connected with such trade or 
business only, where no other agent is expressly 
authorized to make and do such appearances, 
applications and acts.” 
 
9. 
Plain reading of Rule 1 of Order III of the CPC shows that a 
recognized agent can appear, file applications or act in or to any 
Court on behalf of any party; Rule 2 of Order III of the CPC refers 
to a class of persons who could be treated as recognized agents of 
parties, which include a person holding power-of-attorney 

[-6-] 
Writ Petition No.65675/2021 
 
 
 
 
 
authorizing him to make and do such appearance, application and act 
on behalf of a party. The words “appearance”, “application” and 
“act” used in Rules 1 & 2 ibid are not defined therein. However, 
applying ordinary meaning to these words the word “appear” means 
to be present and to represent the party at various stages of litigation. 
The words “application” or “act” mean necessary steps, which can 
be taken on behalf of a party in the Court or in the offices of the Court 
in the course of litigation. Thus, the recognized agent or Special 
Attorney is entitled to appear, file application and act for a party but 
not liable for satisfaction of the decree passed against the Judgment-
debtor; whereas a “surety” is governed under Section 128 of the 
Contract Act, 1872 (Act) and enforceable for performance of any 
decree or any part thereof under Section 145 CPC. Though CPC does 
not strictly apply in family matters but its principles are applicable.  
10. 
From the above legal position, it is evident that the Special 
Attorney will only appear on behalf of a person and will not be liable 
as a surety unless he executes surety bond on behalf of a judgment-
debtor for the satisfaction of decree. 
11. 
In view of above discussion, this Writ Petition is allowed and 
the impugned orders are set-aside being without lawful authority and 
of no legal effect. However, this judgment will not preclude the 
Executing Court to proceed against the Judgment-debtor through all 
modes available under the law for satisfaction of the decree.
