Dr. Khalid Ranjha, Advocate for the petitioner 
 
 
 
Through this writ petition filed under Article 199 
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, 
the petitioner has voiced his grievance as under:- 
 
“In view of the above circumstances, it is most 
respectfully prayed that the above titled writ petition 
may kindly be allowed and the case be referred back to 
learned magistrate for retrial and there after for 
criminal revision before learned ASJ. 
 
Any other adequate relief which this Honorable 
Court deems fit just and proper may also be awarded 
to the petitioner in order to meet the ends of justice.” 
 
2.  
Tersely, the facts of the case are that the petitioner 
had instituted a private complaint under section 6(5) of 
the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, before the 
learned Judicial Magistrate, Sargodha, against respondent 
No.1 with the allegation that he had contracted second 
marriage without her permission and, thus, committed an 
offence. After recording cursory evidence, learned J 
udicial Magistrate, Sargodha, summoned respondent 
No.1 to face the trial in terms of section 6(5) of the 
Ordinance ibid. Respondent No.1 joined the proceedings 
of the case and during the pendency of said proceedings, 
he filed an application under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. with 
the assertion that the allegation of contracting second 
marriage without the permission of petitioner was totally 
against the facts and the private complaint had been filed 
by petitioner just to blackmail him. In fact, he had 

2 
W.P. No.59534 of 2022 
 
 
already divorced the petitioner which was effected on 
06.07.2021 and thereafter he contracted second marriage. 
It was further asserted by the petitioner that there was no 
probability of his conviction in the private complaint, for 
the reason, he may be acquitted of the charge under 
section 249-A, Cr.P.C. This application was accepted by 
learned Magistrate Section-30, Sargodha, vide order 
dated 18.05.2022. Aggrieved by the above-mentioned 
order, the petitioner filed a criminal revision under 
section 439-A, Cr.P.C. before the court of learned 
Sessions Judge, Sargodha, which was entrusted to the 
court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sargodha, 
who, after hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner 
as well as learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor, 
dismissed the same vide order dated 16.07.2022. The 
petitioner has challenged both the orders of learned fora 
below through the instant writ petition with the prayer 
that the case may be referred back to learned Judicial 
Magistrate for re-trial and criminal revision may also be 
remanded back to learned Additional Sessions Judge. 
3. 
It is inter alia contended by learned counsel for the 
petitioner that against the order of acquittal under section 
249-A, Cr.P.C. a criminal revision in terms of section 
439-A, Cr.P.C. was competent, because, acquittal order 
had not been passed on merits. Learned counsel for the 
petitioner has placed reliance upon the case-law titled as 
“The State through Advocate-General, Sindh High Court 
of Karachi v. Raja Abdul Rehman” (2005 SCMR 1544).  
4.  
I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner 
at length on the above short point and also gone through 
the documents appended with this petition.

W.P. No.59534 of 2022 
 
 
5. 
Although petitioner has not challenged any 
specific order in the prayer clause as well as in the 
caption of instant writ petition yet he has prayed for the 
remand of case to the trial court as well as criminal 
revision to the court of Additional Sessions Judge. I am 
afraid that the prayer of the petitioner is misconceived, 
because, matter cannot be referred back to both the fora 
below at the same time. Even otherwise, supplication of 
the petitioner is without the backing of law. After going 
through the documents available with the file, I have 
noticed that the petitioner had filed a private complaint 
under section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws 
Ordinance, 1961, against respondent No.1, wherein 
respondent No.1 filed an application under section     
249-A, Cr.P.C. which was accepted by the trial court vide 
order dated 18.05.2022 whereby respondent No.1 was 
acquitted mainly on the ground that he had already 
divorced the petitioner before contracting second 
marriage. Being aggrieved, the petitioner filed criminal 
revision against the acquittal of respondent No.1, which 
was dismissed by Additional Sessions Judge, Sargodha, 
vide order dated 16.07.2022 with the following 
observations:- 
“3. According to assistance of learned counsel for the 
petitioner, learned ADPP, and record reveals that 
through impugned order learned lower court acquitted 
the respondent No.2, u / s 249-A Cr.P.C, and present 
petitioner challenged the acquittal of respondent No.2, 
through instant revision petition. Order of acquittal u/s 
249-A Cr.P.C, not amenable to revision in view of 
remedy available to the petitioner u / s 417 (2) Cr.P.C. 
Sub-section 5 of section 439-A Cr.P.C, clearly provide 
that where in a court an appeal lies and no appeal is 
brought, not proceeded by way of revision shall be 
entertain at the instance of petitioner who could have 
appealed. Learned ADPP also added that instant 
revision is not proceedable. Hence, instant revision 

4 
W.P. No.59534 of 2022 
 
 
petition is accordingly dismissed. The certified copy of 
this order be sent to the learned Lower Court for 
information. The file of this revision petition be 
consigned to record room after its due completion.” 
6. 
The question, whether the order of acquittal under 
section 249-A, Cr.P.C. was amenable to criminal revision 
or the same was assailable before this Court through a 
petition for special leave to appeal as provided under 
section 417(2) Cr.P.C. has not been satisfactorily 
answered by learned counsel for the petitioner. For 
reference, section 417(2) Cr.P.C. is reproduced as infra:- 
“4l7. Appeal in case of acquittal: (2) If such an order 
of acquittal is passed in any case instituted upon 
complaint and the High Court, on an application made 
to it by the complainant in this behalf grants special 
leave to appeal from the order of acquittal, the 
complainant may present such an appeal to the High 
Court.” 
 
Likewise by virtue of section 439(5), Cr.P.C. there 
is bar on the revisional jurisdiction of the court in the 
cases where remedy of appeal is provided under the Code 
ibid. Sections 439 and 439-A, Cr.P.C. are described as 
infra for the purpose of clarity:- 
“439. High Court’s powers of revision: (1) In the case 
of any proceeding the record of which has been called 
for by itself, […] or which otherwise comes to its 
knowledge, the High Court may, in its discretion, 
exercise any of the powers conferred on a Court of 
Appeal by section 423, 426, 427 and 428 or on a Court 
by section 338, and may enhance the sentence, and, 
when the Judges composing the Court of Revision are 
equally divided in opinion, the case shall be disposed 
of in manner provided by section 429. 
(2) No order under this section shall be made to the 
prejudice of the accused unless he has had an 
opportunity of being heard either personally or by 
pleader in his own defence. 
(3) Where the sentence dealt with under this section 
has been passed by Magistrate […], the Court shall 
not inflict a greater punishment for the offence which, 
in the opinion of such Court, the accused has 

5 
W.P. No.59534 of 2022 
 
 
committed, than might have been inflicted for such 
offence by Magistrate of the first class.  
(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to 
authorize a High Court: 
(a) to convert a finding of acquittal into one of 
conviction, or  
(b) to entertain any proceedings in revision with 
respect to an order made by the Sessions Judge 
under section 439-A.] 
(5) Where under this Code an appeal lies and no 
appeal is brought, no proceedings by way of revision 
shall be entertained at the instance of the party who 
could have appealed. 
(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, 
any convicted person to whom an opportunity has been 
given under sub-section (2) of showing cause why his 
sentence should not be enhanced, shall, in showing 
cause, be entitled also to show cause against his 
conviction.” 
“439-A. Sessions Judge’s powers of revision: (1) In 
the case of any proceeding before a Magistrate the 
record of which has been called for by the Sessions 
Judge or which otherwise comes to his knowledge, the 
Sessions Judge may exercise any of the powers 
conferred on the High Court by section 439. 
(2) An Additional Sessions Judge shall have and may 
exercise all the powers of a Sessions Judge under this 
Chapter in respect of any case which may be 
transferred to him under any general or special order 
of the Session Judge]. 
7. 
Another intriguing aspect of this case which 
cannot be ignored is that whether a petition under Article 
199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, is competent against the order of acquittal under 
section 249-A, Cr.P.C, in this regard, I am of the firm 
view that when the statute has provided a specific 
alternate 
remedy 
of 
appeal 
against 
acquittal, 
constitutional petition is not competent against such an 
order, therefore, the writ petition in hand is not 
maintainable in the eyes of the law.  
8. 
So far as the wisdom laid down by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case-law titled as “The State through 
Advocate-General, Sindh High Court of Karachi v. Raja 

6 
W.P. No.59534 of 2022 
 
 
Abdul Rehman (2005 SCMR 1544) is concerned, 
although it has been held in the aforementioned case-law 
that the order of acquittal of accused under section      
249-A, Cr.P.C. would not have the same sanctity as order 
of acquittal on merits and the principles applicable to 
second category of acquittal would not apply to first 
category of acquittal, but I am of the view that it does not 
mean that the acquittal order passed under section 249-A, 
Cr.P.C. is amenable to revisional jurisdiction as 
enshrined in section 439-A, Cr.P.C. After going through 
the above mentioned case-law, it manifests that even in 
the said case also, appeal in terms of section 417, Cr.P.C. 
was filed before the Sindh High Court against the 
acquittal of accused under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. which 
was dismissed in limine and the same was challenged 
before the Supreme Court of Pakistan. In this way, it is 
abundantly clear that the case-law relied upon by learned 
counsel for the petitioner is not helpful to him.  
9. 
It is noteworthy that criminal appeal and revision 
have different features. Appeal is filed on question of law 
and facts in the light of section 418, Cr.P.C. whereas in 
criminal revision only correctness, legality and propriety 
of any finding, sentence or order is to be seen. A criminal 
revision is not competent against the order of acquittal, 
because, it is prohibited according to section 439(4)(a) 
Cr.P.C. 
10. 
Aftermath of above discussion is that the criminal 
revision before the court of learned Additional Sessions 
Judge was not competent, because, an order of acquittal 
can only be assailed by way of remedy provided under 
section 417(2), Cr.P.C. and not otherwise, therefore, 

7 
W.P. No.59534 of 2022 
 
 
there is no illegality or perversity in the order passed by 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, who has rightly 
dismissed the criminal revision. Resultantly, this 
constitutional petition has no force and the same is 
hereby dismissed in limine.
