Muhammad Talal co-accused, convicted and sentenced Muhammad 
Nawaz appellant as under:-  
Under Section  302(b) PPC: - 
Life Imprisonment for committing murder of Salman Ali 
with direction to pay compensation under Section 544-A, 
Cr.P.C. to the tune of Rs.5,00,000/- to the legal heirs of 
deceased, recoverable as arrears of land revenue, or in 
default thereof to further undergo simple imprisonment for 
six months. However, benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. was 
extended in his favour.  
 
2. 
The prosecution story as given in the judgment of the trial court 
reads as under:- 
“…Facts leading to filing of instant private complaint 
are that complainant party is having agricultural land 
at Mouza Lakhaodair. On 21.11.2021, complainant’s 
brothers Muratab Ali, Salman Ali, and Sakhawat Ali 
were sowing wheat crop in their fields where they saw 
that accused Nawaz and Talal opened water in their 
fields. Complainant’s brothers Salman etc. forbade 
them due to which accused Muhammad Nawaz 
became infuriated and went away while extending 
threats to them. At about 01:30 p.m. complainant’s 
brother Muratab Ali called the complainant through 
mobile phone No. 0308-4124726 on his mobile phone 
No.0300-4046035 and told the entire episode. 
Complainant asked him not to quarrel with them and 
that he himself was coming. Thereafter, complainant 
on his own vehicle ACG-730 reached at the spot and 
saw that accused Muhammad Nawaz was quarreling 
with his brothers Salman Ali, Sakhawat Ali and 
Muratab Ali and in his view accused Muhammad 
Nawaz made fire shot with his pistol which landed on 
left arm and armpit of Salman Ali who fell down in 
injured condition. Complainant stepped ahead to save 
Salman Ali on which accused Muhammad Talal made 
fire-shot on Muratab Ali with his pistol which landed 
on his left thigh and he also fell down in injured 
condition. The accused persons while making firing 
fled away from the spot. Complainant made call on 
mobile police emergency number and while boarding 
Salman Ali in vehicle was shifting him to Shalimar 
Hospital who succumbed to the injuries on reaching 
hospital 
which 
was 
confirmed 
by 
doctors. 
Complainant then went to police station and moved 
application Ex-PA for registration of case. Muratab Ali

injured was shifted to Services Hospital by Sakhawat 
Ali, who remained under treatment there. 
 
Initially FIR No.2559/2021, under sections 302, 
34, 324, 337-F(iii) PPC, at police station Manawan, 
Lahore was registered against the accused persons, but 
feeling aggrieved with investigation of said case FIR, 
the complainant filed the instant private complaint Ex-
PE.….” 
3. 
After recording cursory statements of complainant and PWs, the 
accused were summoned to face trial. The trial court, after observing all 
the pre-trial codal formalities, framed charge against the appellant and his 
acquitted co-accused under sections 302, 34, 324 and 337-F(iii) PPC, to 
which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove its case, 
the prosecution produced as many as 02 PWs and 10 CWs. The ocular 
account of the incident in issue had been furnished by Sharafat Ali 
complainant (PW.1) and Muratab Ali injured (PW.2). Syed Muhammad 
Younus Bukhari, Draftsman appeared as CW.1, who prepared scaled site 
plan of the place of occurrence. Ulfat Hayat, Inspector (CW.10) was the 
investigating officer of the case, who stated about various steps taken by 
him during the course of investigation. Medical evidence was furnished 
by Doctor Waqas Ahmad (CW.4) and Doctor Mohsin Munawar (CW.9).  
The remaining evidence produced by the prosecution was formal in 
nature. The prosecution gave up Irfan Ali 5368/C, Ghulam Sabir 17396/C 
and Adil Saeed 5393/C PWs being unnecessary and while tendering in 
evidence reports of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PG 
and Exh.PH) closed its evidence. 
4. 
Thereafter, statements under section 342 Cr.P.C. of the appellant 
and his acquitted co-accused were recorded in which they denied the 
allegations leveled against them and professed their innocence. While 
answering to a question, “why this case is against you and why PWs 
deposed against you? Muhammad Nawaz appellant stated as under:- 
“The real facts have been suppressed by complainant. In 
fact, at about 12:00/01:00 noon time, deceased and 
Muratab Ali came to our Dera alongwith brothers and they 
made indiscriminate firing upon me. His brothers were 
armed with 'kulhari'. The deceased and Sakhawat Ali gave

Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024.

'kulhari' blows on my father's head and other parts of body. 
Resultantly, he was injured, whereas, the deceased made 
indiscriminate firing upon him. Our vehicles were also 
parked at our Dera. Fires made by complainant party hit to 
the vehicles and the bullets reflected from vehicles and one 
of the bullet hit to Salman Ali at his left armpit while other 
one bullet hit to Muratab Ali on his left thigh. As I was 
seriously injured by them, Muratab Ali alongwith deceased 
decamped. Muratab Ali was shifted to Services Hospital, 
Lahore where he was admitted at 01:15 p.m, on 
21.11.2022, whereas, deceased was shifted to his house, 
who ultimately succumbed to the injuries. The complainant 
was not present there and later on after 3/4 hours of death 
of deceased, the deceased was shifted to hospital. When 
complainant who was on duty in traffic police at Lahore 
City reached in the hospital and came to know this fact that 
Salman Ali had expired and Muratab Ali was injured, then 
he cooked up a false and fabricated story of occurrence at 
02:00 p.m on 21.11.2021. He lodged FIR with due 
deliberation and consultation after about 4/5 hours. It is 
also pertinent to mention here that the complainant has not 
mentioned that he was wearing his uniform and his shirt 
became blood stained due to lifting of his brother, neither 
in FIR nor in inquest report and even in his evidence 
before the Court. The complainant party after legal advice 
thought that presence of complainant be established in any 
manner, because he was on his duty as traffic constable at 
Lahore City, then he cooked up a false and incorrect story 
of blood stained uniform/shirt just to prove his presence at 
the scene of occurrence. This story is also false from the 
fact that if the blood stained shirt of complainant was 
available at the time of lifting dead body of the deceased, 
the name plate of the complainant must have been on the 
shirt, which was later on taken into possession but same is 
not available on the said shirt. The availability of shirt and 
taking the same into possession on very first day is also not 
proved. If the shirt had been taken into possession on very 
first day of registration of FIR, then same must had been 
sent to Punjab Forensic Science Agency when empties and 
blood stained earth were sent to Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency. Non-sending of shirt with the blood stained earth 
and empties also proves that it was not in possession of 
police. Furthermore, till 28.12.2021 this shirt was not sent 
to Punjab Forensic Science Agency, when allegedly 
recovered pistol was sent to Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency on 29.12.2021 with delay of about one month and 
eight days after alleged occurrence and this delay shows 
the false managing of shirt of the complainant. It is also 
important to mention here that the place of occurrence has 
been changed because it is admitted by the prosecution 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024.

witnesses that there was no place in the land of the accused 
party, where any source of watering of agricultural field of 
complainant was available at the alleged place of 
occurrence. The said land belongs to three other persons 
who are neither witnesses nor having any concern with the 
complainant party. The place where alleged occurrence has 
been shown by the complainant party is on the lower 
pedestal than the land of complainant party and there is a 
"Banna" (heap) of four feet height from alleged place of 
occurrence and land of complainant and no water can flow 
from place of occurrence to the land of complainant party. 
Hence, whole story of occurrence narrated by complainant 
party in FIR as well as in complaint is false, fabricated, 
concocted having no legs to stand upon. As, we have 
separated our land from the complainant party and we were 
in possession of Dera, complainant party wants to usurp 
our land and Dera that is why deceased etc. attacked upon 
our Dera and injured me as well as my father Nawaz and 
by suppressing all these injuries on our persons, they have 
concocted up a false and fabricated story of occurrence, 
which has been proved as false during the trial. 
 
The appellant and his acquitted co-accused did not opt to appear as 
their own witnesses on oath as provided under Section 340(2) of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1898, in disproof of the allegations leveled against 
them, however, appellant produced Doctor Shah Rukh (CW.11) in his 
defence evidence.   
5. 
The trial court vide judgment dated 01-12-2023 found the appellant 
guilty, convicted and sentenced him as mentioned above, however, 
acquitted his co-accused namely Muhammad Talal of the charges through 
the same judgment by giving him the benefit of doubt, hence, these 
appeals and criminal revision before this Court. 
6. 
It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that although 
FIR is shown to have been promptly lodged within a period of just 45 
minutes after the occurrence but being dissatisfied from the police 
investigation, Sharafat Ali complainant (PW.1) filed private complaint 
(Exh.PE) with a delay of five months and six days just to fill up the 
lacunas left in FIR, similarly post mortem examination on the dead body 
of Salman Ali (deceased) was conducted with a considerable delay of nine 
hours which reflects that prosecution witnesses were not present at the 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023,

Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024.

time and place of occurrence and police remained busy in procuring and 
planting fake eyewitnesses and cooking up a false story for the 
prosecution before preparing police papers necessary for getting a 
favourable postmortem examination report; that although Muratab Ali 
(PW.2) has been shown as injured PW but it is not necessary that 
whatever he has stated is a gospel truth and his statement is to be seen in 
the light of parameters and guidelines settled by the superior Courts of the 
country; that the prosecution has badly failed to prove the mode and 
manner of occurrence described in the crime report; that presence of 
Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) at the time and place of occurrence, i.e. 02.00 
p.m. on 21.11.2021 is negated from Rapat No.11 dated 21.11.2021 
(Exh.DE), according to which, on the same day at 01.15 p.m. he was 
admitted in Services Hospital, Lahore; that the alleged eyewitnesses have 
made dishonest improvements to their previous statements, for the reason, 
their evidence is not reliable; that with regard to the recovery of pistol 
from the possession of Muhammad Nawaz appellant and positive report 
of PFSA, learned counsel for the appellant stated that the same are 
inconsequential for the prosecution case because empties were sent to the 
office of PFSA on 06.12.2021, i.e. after 15 days of the occurrence which 
shows that empties were secured subsequently and not during spot 
inspection after the occurrence; that motive has already been disbelieved 
by the trial court through cogent and convincing reasons; lastly submitted 
that the appeal filed by Muhammad Nawaz appellant be allowed and he 
be acquitted of the charge.  
7. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for the complainant argued that it was a 
daylight occurrence, the appellant and the accused party being inter se 
close relatives and residents of the same vicinity were known to each 
other, for the reason, there was no chance of misidentification of the 
accused; that the FIR had also been promptly lodged, leaving no room for 
the accused to claim that the matter was reported to the police with due 
deliberation and consultation; that so far as the delay in post mortem 
examination on the dead body of Salman Ali (deceased) is concerned, one 
person Muratab Ali (PW.2) was in injured condition whereas Salman Ali 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023,

Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024.

had already lost his life, therefore, it was prime consideration of the 
complainant party to save the life of Muratab Ali injured (PW.2), in this 
way, delay in post mortem examination is not helpful to the defence; that 
the presence of Sharafat Ali, complainant (PW.1) and Muratab Ali injured 
(PW.2) is fully proved and despite lengthy cross-examination upon the 
above mentioned PWs, nothing favourable to the defence could be 
brought from their mouths; even otherwise, Muratab Ali (PW.2) is also 
injured witness which further established his presence at the time and 
place of occurrence; that mere this fact that both the PWs are real brothers 
of Salman Ali (deceased) is not a justifiable ground to disbelieve their 
evidence, because, they admittedly had no previous animosity to falsely 
entangle the accused persons in this case, similarly, this fact does not 
appeal to a prudent mind that due to their kinship with the deceased, they 
would spare the real perpetrator and entangle the accused falsely; that 
Rapat No.11 dated 21.11.2021 (Exh.DE) is a photocopy and has illegally 
been exhibited by the trial court despite objection of complainant’s 
counsel and the same can be brushed aside by this Court. To substantiate 
this contention, learned counsel for the complainant has placed reliance 
upon case-law titled as “Sana Ulah vs. The State” (1990 P.Cr.L.J. 466). 
He further maintained that the prosecution witnesses were not cross-
examined on material points and it is settled proposition of law that if a 
portion of examination-in-chief is not cross-examined then the same will 
be deemed to have been admitted. Reference was made to the case-laws 
titled as “Dr. Javed Akhtar vs. The State” (PLD 2007 SC 249), “Ghulam 
Qadir Patani vs. The State” (2007 P.Cr.L.J. 1435) and “Arbab Tasleem 
vs. The State” (PLD 2010 SC 642); that defence has taken a specific plea 
during cross-examination upon the PWs that complainant party of FIR 
case assaulted upon the accused party on 21.11.2021 at 01.30 p.m. but 
failed to prove the same, in this way, occurrence is admitted by the 
defence, although with a slightly different mode and manner. Further 
argued that if a party takes a specific plea then the burden of proof shifts 
upon him. Reliance was placed upon the case-laws titled as “Ashiq 
Hussain alias Muhammad Ashraf vs. The State” (PLD 1994 SC 879), 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024.

“Mst. Mumtaz Begum vs. Ghulam Farid and another” (2003 SCMR 647) 
and “Muhammad Javed vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 864); that site plan 
is not substantive piece of evidence as observed in the case-law reported 
as “Elahi Bakhsh vs. Rab Nawaz and another” (2002 SCMR 1842); that 
the trial court has acquitted Muhammad Talal accused merely on the basis 
of ipse dixit of police which is not binding upon the court. Learned 
counsel for the complainant has placed reliance upon the case-law titled 
as “Anwar Shamim and another vs. The State” (2010 SCMR 1791). 
Lastly submitted that the prosecution has proved its case up to the hilt 
through trustworthy and confidence inspiring ocular account, which is 
duly supported by medical evidence and corroborated by recovery of 
weapon of offence, for the reason, the appeal filed by Muhammad Nawaz 
(appellant) be dismissed; criminal revision filed by the petitioner 
(complainant) be accepted and normal penalty of death be awarded to 
Muhammad Nawaz appellant/respondent and impugned judgment of 
acquittal of Muhammad Talal co-accused/ respondent be set aside and he 
be also punished in accordance with law.  
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General while adopting the 
arguments of learned counsel for the complainant supplicated for the 
dismissal of appeal against conviction filed by Muhammad Nawaz 
appellant.  
8. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the appellant as 
well as learned counsel for the complainant and learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General assiduously and also scanned the record minutely with 
their able assistance.  
9. 
The occurrence in this case allegedly took place on 21.11.2021 at 
02.00 p.m. and the matter was reported to the police on the same day at 
02.45 p.m., i.e. within a period of 45 minutes but post mortem 
examination on the dead body of Salman Ali (deceased) was conducted 
on 21.11.2021 at 11.00 p.m., i.e. with the delay of nine hours. It has been 
clearly mentioned in crime report (Exh.CW6/A) and private complaint 
(Exh.PE) that after the occurrence, Sharafat Ali complainant (PW.1) made 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024.

a call to police emergency number and escorted Salman Ali, in injured 
condition, to Shalamar Hospital who succumbed to the injuries while 
reaching hospital, whereas, other injured namely Muratab Ali was shifted 
by his brother Sakhawat Ali to Services Hospital for the purpose of 
treatment. In this way, both the injured were shifted to hospitals 
immediately. According to the statement of Dr. Mohsin Munawar 
(CW.9), time that elapsed between injury and death of Salman Ali was 
within few minutes, while between death and post mortem examination 
was 9 to 15 hours. His (CW.9) statement further reflects that the dead 
body of Salman Ali (deceased) was received in the department on 
21.11.2021 at 04:00 p.m. He (CW.9) further stated in his cross-
examination that documents were received at 10:15 p.m. on 21.11.2021 
and post mortem examination was conducted by Dr. Zain Asif at 11:00 
p.m. Besides, Ulfat Hayat, Inspector/I.O. (CW.10) has admitted in his 
cross-examination that the police documents were provided to the doctor 
at 10:45 p.m. i.e. eight hours and forty minutes after the occurrence, thus, 
the delay in conducting post mortem examination cannot be attributed to 
the doctor. Keeping in view the above mentioned gross delay in the post 
mortem examination, an adverse inference can be drawn that the 
prosecution witnesses were not present at the time and place of 
occurrence and the intervening period had been consumed in fabricating a 
false story after preliminary investigation, otherwise there was no 
justification of such delay for conducting post mortem examination on the 
dead body of the deceased. Wisdom is derived from the case-laws tilted as 
“Muhammad Ilyas vs. Muhammad Abid alias Billa and others” (2017 
SCMR 54), “Muhammad Adnan and another vs. The State and others” 
(2021 SCMR 16) and “Iftikhar Hussain alias Kharoo vs. The State” 
(2024 SCMR 1449). 
10. 
Furthermore, Sharafat Ali complainant (PW.1), while changing the 
prosecution version as reproduced supra, filed private complaint (Exh.PE) 
with the delay of five months and six days that too without giving any 
plausible reasoning qua such delay, meaning thereby, the private 
complaint was filed after due deliberation and consultation just to fill up 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024.

the lacunas left in the FIR. I fortify my view from the dictum laid down in 
case-law titled as “Muhammad Azad vs. Ahmad Ali and 2 other” (PLD 
2003 Supreme Court 14) wherein it was held as under:-   
“Admittedly the private complaint on the basis which the 
cognizance was taken by the trial Court and the entire 
evidence was adduced against the respondent Ahmad Ali 
was filed belatedly i.e. after about three months and four 
days, for which no explanation of any sort was furnished 
either at the trial or thereafter”. 
11. 
Coming to the ocular account, I have observed that both the 
eyewitnesses, i.e. Sharafat Ali complainant (PW.1) and Muratab Ali 
injured (PW.2) were the real brothers of Salman Ali (deceased). Record 
reflects that on the day of occurrence, Sharafat Ali complainant (PW.1) 
and Muratab Ali (PW.2) were serving in police department. I have noted 
that Sharafat Ali complainant (PW.1) has failed to justify his presence at 
the time and place of occurrence because he could not establish through 
any solid evidence that he was on leave at the date and time of 
occurrence. Relevant portion of his cross-examination is mentioned 
below:-  
“I have been serving in Police Department since 
26.07.1997. On 21.11.2021, I was closed to line. Generally 
police officials enter their arrival and departure in 
Roznamcha. I used to enter my departure and arrival in 
Roznamcha of Mobeen Shaheed, Manawan Police Lines. 
On 20.11.2021, I received message on my phone when I 
was at my home that I had to proceed to Mall-II for duty at 
03.00 p.m. Said message was transmitted be duty officer 
lines. I do not remember his name. On 20.11.2021 I was 
posted at Shadman traffic sector and I departed from there 
to my home. I was closed to line from said Shadman traffic 
sector. 
Rapat 
regarding 
my 
said 
departure 
was 
incorporated in Roznamcha of Shadman traffic sector. 
Again said departure Rapat is not incorporated in the 
Roznamcha. I do not remember that on 20.11.2021 who 
was Muharrer of the said traffic sector. On 21.11.2021 my 
arrival was not incorporated in Roznamcha but I was told 
that my duty was at Mall Road. On 21.11.2021, I had not 
yet joined my duty. I do not remember whether I had 
produced the said text message before the investigating 
officer sent to me by the duty officer lines. It is incorrect to 
suggest that I have deliberately suppressed this fact. It is 
incorrect to suggest that I am intentionally concealing and 
suppressing the name of Muharrer. It is incorrect to 
suggest that I am also suppressing this fact that on 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024. 
 
 
11
21.11.2021, I was on my duty and my duty was assigned 
by Muharrer through Rapat Roznamcha.” 
So far as the duty hours of Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) are 
concerned, he has stated in his cross-examination as under:- 
“I am serving in Police Department. During the days of 
occurrence I was performing duty at office of CCPO, 
Lahore. My place of duty is at a distance of ten kilometers 
from my residence. It is incorrect to suggest that I am 
deposing falsely in this regard. My duty starts at about 
09.00 a.m. and ends at about 05.00 p.m. or 10.00 p.m. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Being driver my departure and arrival is not to be 
incorporated in Roznamcha. It is correct that when 
departure of police officer is incorporated in Roznamcha 
then name of accompanying driver is also mentioned 
therein. On 21.11.2021, I was posted as driver with Syed 
Mubashar Hussain Shah, PR-II to CCPO, Lahore. I was on 
leave on 21.11.2021. I had not produced any written proof 
before the I.O. during investigation that I was on leave on 
21.11.2021. ” 
  
In the light of above-mentioned portion of cross-examination upon 
Muratab Ali injured (PW.2), it is abundantly clear that he also remained 
unable to prove that he was on leave on the date and time of occurrence.  
To establish his presence at the spot, Sharafat Ali complainant  
(PW.1) produced his blood-stained shirt before Ulfat Hayat, Inspector/ 
I.O. (CW.10) on 21.11.2021, which was allegedly taken into possession 
vide memo (Exh.CW3/C), but contrary to the above stance of the 
complainant, Ulfat Hayat, Inspector/ I.O. (CW.10) has stated in his cross-
examination that the complainant had also not mentioned that he produced 
his blood stained shirt to the police at the time of recording of FIR. He 
(CW.10) further stated that he had not described in the site plan that the 
complainant showed him any blood-stained shirt. He (CW.10) has also 
not mentioned this fact in the police proceedings or in the inquest report. 
Ulfat Hayat, Inspector/I.O (CW10) has stated in his cross-examination as 
infra:- 
“It is correct that no name plate of name of complainant 
Sharafat Ali was on the shirt P-9. It is also correct that in 
the recovery memo Ex.PC it is not mentioned that the shirt

of complainant which is shirt of uniform of city traffic 
police contains the name plate of Sharafat Ali. ” 
Similarly, Faqeer Hussain 12655/C (CW.3) who is a witness of 
recovery of Shirt (P-9) has narrated in his cross-examination as infra:- 
“I had mentioned in my statement u/s 161 of Cr.P.C. that I 
and Amjad Ali/C alongwith Ulfat Hayat/ Inspector reached 
the place of occurrence. Confronted with Exh. DC wherein 
not so recorded. I had not mentined in my statement u/s 161 
of Cr.P.C. the date and time of our reaching the place of 
occurrence. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
It is correct that on recovery memo Ex. CW.3/C regarding 
taking into possession shirt (P-9) of complainant Sharafat 
his signatures are not available. It is correct that name of 
Sharafat is also not mentioned on the uniform as per 
recovery memo. It is correct that in my presence statement 
of Sharafat complainant was also not recorded in this regard 
by the investigating officer. It is correct that seal of Ulfat 
Hayat is made out as UH but he did not affix the said seal 
rather with MS.” 
 
Ulfat Hayat, Inspector/I.O. (CW10) has also admitted in his cross-
examination as under:-  
“It is correct that since the Zimni No. 1 to Zimni No. 5 
dated 21.11.2021 to 03.12.2021 I have not specifically 
mentioned that the shirt of complainant was handed over to 
Muharrer” 
 
Insofar as the evidence of Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) is concerned, 
although he is alleged to have a stamp of injury on his body but it is not 
necessary that whatever he has stated is a gospel truth. I have to take his 
evidence in the light of settled rule of prudence. As per prosecution story, 
he (PW.2) sustained firearm injury at the time and place of occurrence but 
he was medically examined on 4th day of the occurrence, i.e. 25.11.2021. 
While appearing in the witness box during his cross-examination, he 
stated that he was medically examined on 21.11.2021 and denied this fact 
that he was medically examined on 25.11.2021. Relevant lines of his 
cross-examination are mentioned below:-      
“On 21.11.2021, I was medically examined. It is incorrect 
to suggest that I am deposing falsely in this regard as I was 
medically examined on 25.11.2021. It is incorrect to 
suggest that on 25.11.2021  at 07.20 p.m. Irfan Ali/C took

me for medical examination. It is not confirmed in my mind 
that I was medically examined at 07.20 p.m. on 25.11.2021. 
It is not in my knowledge that on 25.11.2021 my medico 
legal examination was conducted by the doctor by the order 
of the learned Magistrate” 
Contrary to the above, Dr. Waqas Ahmad (CW.4) has categorically 
stated that he had medically examined Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) on 
25.11.2021 at 07.30 p.m. Moreover, he has disclosed in his examination-
in-chief that surgical notes from Services Hospital, Lahore under diary 
No. 44476 dated 26.11.2021 were received where date of admission of 
Muratab Ali injured was mentioned as 21.11.2021 and he was also 
discharged on 21.11.2021 as he was vitally stable. According to the 
statement of Ulfat Hayat, Inspector/I.O. (CW.10) on 22.11.2021 he was 
present at Lakhodair where Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) joined the 
investigation with him and he recorded his statement under section 161, 
Cr.P.C. There is no exegesis of one day’s delay in recording his statement 
under section 161, Cr.P.C. which diminishes his credibility as observed 
by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case-law reported as “Khial 
Muhammad vs. The State” (2024 SCMR 1490).  
Similarly, it is mentioned in FIR (Exh.CW6/A) that Muratab Ali 
injured (PW.2) was shifted to Services Hospital, Lahore, but the 
prosecution has no satisfactory explanation that why he was not got 
medically examined by the concerned doctor at Services Hospital, Lahore, 
and why his Medico-legal Certificate was not obtained on the same day. 
Moreover, on the following day i.e. 22.11.2021, he (PW.2) joined the 
investigation and got recorded his statement under section 161, Cr.P.C. 
but even on this day, he was not sent by the Investigating Officer (CW.10) 
for his medical examination and issuance of Medico-legal Certificate.  
Another crippling feature of this case is that at the time of joining 
police investigation on 22.11.2021, Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) did not 
produce his blood stained clothes and subsequently on 27.11.2021, he 
produced the same but on that day, he (PW.2) had not produced his 
Medico-legal Certificate which was produced by Irfan Ali constable 
before the investigating officer on 03.12.2021. I have noted that there is 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024. 
 
 
14
no evidence that who had directed Irfan Ali constable to get Muratab Ali 
injured (PW.2) medically examined from Rural Health Centre (RHC), 
Awan Dhai Wala, Lahore. Moreover, Irfan Ali constable has not been 
produced in the evidence. I have also observed that no plausible 
explanation has been given by the prosecution qua delayed medical 
examination of Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) especially when the matter 
was allegedly reported promptly to the police and it has been specifically 
mentioned in crime report (Exh.CW6/A) that Sakhawat Ali (jettisoned 
PW) escorted Muratab Ali, in injured condition, to Services Hospital, 
Lahore, for the purpose of treatment.  
 
In the light of above circumstances, I am of the view that if the 
above-mentioned PW had sustained the injury at the hands of Muhammad 
Talal co-accused (since acquitted) at the time and place of occurrence 
then he should have been immediately examined by the concerned 
medical officer and issued his Medico-legal Certificate. Furthermore, it 
has also come on the surface of record that Dr. Waqas Ahmad (CW.4), 
who medically examined Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) on 25.11.2021 at 
07.30 p.m. and issued his Medico-legal Certificate (Exh.CW4/A), stated 
in his cross-examination that he had not mentioned the injury No.1-A as 
entry or inverted wound in MLC. He had also not mentioned injury No.1-
B as exit or everted wound in MLC, however, he had mentioned therein 
whatever was told to him by the injured. He further admitted in his cross-
examination as infra:-  
No record of Services Hospital, Lahore was produced before 
me by the injured that is why I have not recorded the same in 
my report. I have mentioned in my report the words "that 
wound was surgically debrided having rough margins from 
Services Hospital, Lahore" because it was told to me by the 
injured. The duration of four days was also told to me by the 
injured. This medico legal was conducted by me through 
Court orders. It is correct that I have not mentioned in MLC 
Ex-CW.4/A that MLC was conducted as per Court order. I 
annexed the said Court order with the MLC. (At this stage, 
the file was examined but no such Court order is available 
on file on the basis of which MLC was conducted by the 
doctor). 26684-85 mentioned on document is not the diary 
number of our Rural Health Center, Lahore. Awan 
Dhayewala. Diary number mentioned on our Rural Health

15
Center, Awan Dhayewala, Lahore is 44474, dated 
26.11.2021/1 referred the injured for x-ray of left thigh and 
consultant radiologist opinion regarding injuries No.1-A.1-8 
plus presence of metallic dust and 1.5 x 1 cm wound over 
lateral aspect of left thigh and 2 x1.5 cm wound on posterior 
aspect but these x-rays were not produced before me. No 
fracture was seen in the x-ray of left thigh and no metallic 
dust was also seen. The opinion mentioned overleaf MLC as 
EMR-84422934, dated 21.11.2021 was not authored by me. 
No document concerning to the same of Services Hospital, 
Lahore was produced before me. The date is mentioned as 
01.12.2021 on the document. 
He also admitted that Rural Health Centre (RHC) Awan Dhai Wala, 
Lahore, is closer to village Lakhodair than Services Hospital, Lahore. He 
also conceded that from 21.11.2021 to 24.11.2021, the injured never 
appeared in Rural Health Centre (RHC) Awan Dhai Wala, Lahore.  
 
In the light of above-mentioned facts, possibility cannot be ruled 
out that Medico-legal Certificate of Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) was 
subsequently maneuvered by the prosecution as both the eyewitnesses, i.e. 
PW.1 and PW2 were police officials. If PW.2 was injured in the same 
occurrence, he should have been examined on the day of occurrence. This 
fact raises a question about the genuineness of his injury. I have observed 
that according to prosecution story, after the occurrence Salman Ali (since 
deceased) was escorted to Shalamar Hospital in injured condition by 
Sharafat Ali complainant (PW.1) whereas Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) 
was shifted to Services Hospital, Lahore by his other brother Sakhawat 
Ali (jettisoned PW). It does not appeal to a prudent mind that why both 
injured were taken to different hospitals, because, if they had sustained 
injuries at the same time then they should have been taken by their real 
brothers to one and the same hospital. This fact is sufficient to hold that 
Salman Ali (since deceased) and Muratab Ali (PW.2) had not sustained 
injuries at the same time and place. It is obvious that the occurrence had 
not taken place as per mode and manner described by the prosecution.  I 
have noted that due to the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, 
the trial court has rightly held in paragraph No. 17 of the impugned 
judgment that:- 
“It stands established that both the parties have suppressed 
true and actual facts from the Court and they have not 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024. 
 
 
16
spoken the whole truth. The alleged occurrence had not 
taken place in the mode and manner as claimed by both the 
parties.” 
12. 
Another important aspect of this case is that occurrence allegedly 
took place upon forbidding the accused party from diverting canal water 
in the land of complainant party as the wheat crop could not be sowed by 
them. According to the site plan (Exh.CW10/E) occurrence took place in 
Khasra No.4622, which was owned by Ameen and Idrees and was being 
cultivated by Shafique, etc. but not by the complainant party. More so, it 
is not mentioned in the site plan of the place of occurrence that the land of 
the complainant party was irrigated by the accused persons or there was 
any proof of sowing wheat crop. Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) failed to 
disclose Khasra number of land owned by them. Relevant portion of his 
cross-examination reads as under:-     
“I cannot say about any khasra numbers which are in our 
ownership.” 
Similarly, Ulfat Hayat Inspector/I.O (CW.10) has stated in his 
cross-examination as infra:- 
“It is correct that the place where occurrence took place and 
from where I collected blood stained earth is owned and 
cultivated by Ameen, Idres and Shafique. It is correct that at 
the place of occurrence there was a partition (بنہ) as well as 
heap of mud. It is correct that agricultural land of Haji 
Muhammad Yousaf, etc. is four feet high than the place of 
occurrence, owned by Ameen, Idrees and Shafique. It is 
correct that in the land owned by complainant, no occurrence 
took place. It is correct that I had not shown any watercourse 
(اھکہل) in the land of complainant party. It is correct that no 
water can flow from the place of occurrence to the land of 
complainant party because it is four feet high than the place of 
occurrence. It is correct that no equipment for sowing wheat 
crop such as tractor, wheat seed or any other kind of 
machinery was available at the place of occurrence, necessary 
for sowing wheat crop.” 
It is noteworthy that Syed Muhammad Younas Bukhari (CW.1) has 
stated in his cross-examination as under:-  
“I prepared scaled site plan on instructions of I.O. pointation of 
complainant and witnesses as well as my visualization at the 
place of occurrence. Place of occurrence is situated in Khasra 
No. 4622 which is owned by Ameen and Idrees while 
cultivated by Shafique, etc. I have not mentioned in the site 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024. 
 
 
17
plan that the place of occurrence is owned by the complainant 
or witnesses as it was neither told to me by them nor intimated 
by the investigating officer. It is correct that I have not 
mentioned that on place of occurrence wheat crop was being 
cultivated as it was neither intimated to me by the investigating 
officer nor pointed out by the complainant and witnesses. It is 
correct that I have not shown any agricultural property of the 
deceased, complainant and eyewitnesses in my scaled site plan 
Exh.CW-1/A and Ex.-CW.1/B on the northern, western and 
southern side of the place of occurrence as neither it was 
intimated to me by the investigating officer nor pointed by the 
complainant and witnesses. It is correct that I have not shown 
any water-channel in the scaled site plan as neither it was 
intimated to me by the investigating officer nor told by the 
complainant and witnesses. ” 
In the light of above-mentioned facts, I am quite confident to hold 
that first episode of the occurrence is not proved.  
So far as the contention of learned counsel for the complainant that 
site plan is not a substantive piece of evidence and cannot be given 
preference over the direct evidence of eyewitnesses is concerned, I am in 
agreement with the proposition that although site plan is not a substantive 
piece of evidence as held in case of “Ellahi Bakhsh vs. Rab Nawaz and 
another” (2002 SCMR 1842) but it reflects the view of crime scene and 
the same can be used to contradict or disbelieve the eyewitnesses. In the 
above-mentioned case law, which has been referred by learned counsel 
for the complainant, it has been held as under:- 
We have also examined the esteemed view of Sardar 
Muhammad Latif Khan Khosa, learned Senior Advocate. 
Supreme Court that it was physically impossible for Ellahi 
Bukhsh (P.W.7) to see the place of occurrence as he was 
shown to have been standing on a long distance. In this 
regard site plan (Exh.P.M at page 147 of the paper book) 
has been referred with specific mention to point No. l and 
point No.4. It is worth mentioned that in fact the site plan 
is Exh.P.C (page 133 of the paper book) wherein it has 
been clarified that the place of occurrence was without a 
boundary wall and accordingly Ellahi Bukhsh (P.W.7) was 
in a position to see point No.4 (place of occurrence) from 
point No.1 (place where Ellahi Bukhsh was present). In 
this regard we have also perused carefully the statement of 
Ellahi Bukhsh (P.W.7) and cross-examination conducted 
by learned defence counsel which makes it abundant clear 
that Ellahi Bukhsh (P.W.7) was never confronted with site 
plan (Exh.P.C) and, therefore, the said contention deserves 
no consideration. Even otherwise the site plan is not a 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024. 
 
 
18
substantive piece of evidence and can be ignored when the 
witness was not confronted with it. 
 
I am, however, of the view that there must be some purpose behind 
the preparation of site plan which is arranged twice during the course of 
investigation. Initially, the investigating officer himself prepares a rough 
site plan at the time of his first visit to the place of occurrence and 
thereafter, a scaled site plan is also drafted by the expert under the 
direction of investigating officer and on pointation of eyewitness(es). If it 
has to be treated as a waste-paper and cannot be given any consideration, 
then there must have been no necessity at all for its preparation that too 
for twice. It is also not the case that the investigating officer of his own 
prepares the rough site plan and then gets prepare a scaled site plan from 
the expert as of routine or without any purpose rather he is required to 
carry this exercise in terms of Rule 13, Chapter-25, Volume-3 of the 
Punjab Police Rules, 1934, which is hereby described as under: - 
25.13. Plan of scene. - (1) In all important cases two plans 
of the scene of the offences shall be prepared by a qualified 
police officer or other suitable agency one to be submitted 
with the charge sheet or final report and the other to be 
retained for departmental use.  
(2) The following rules shall govern the preparation of 
maps or plans by patwaris or other expert :-  
(i) Pursuant to paragraph 26 of the Patwari Rules, 
the Financial Commissioner, with the concurrence 
of the Inspector General of Police, issues the 
following instructions concerning the preparation by 
patwaris of maps needed to illustrate police 
inquiries.  
(ii) In ordinary cases no demands for such maps will 
be made upon patwaris.  
(iii) In the case of heinous crime, especially in cases 
of murder or riots connected with land disputes, the 
police officer investigating the case will, if he 
considers an accurate map is required, summons to 
the scene of the crime the patwari of the circle in 
which it occurred and cause him to prepare two 
maps, one for production in court as evidence and 
the other for the use of the police investigating 
agency. In the former reference relating to facts 
observed by the police officer should be entered 
while in the latter references based on the statement 
of witnesses which are not relevant in evidence may 
be recorded. He will be careful not to detain the 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024. 
 
 
19
patwaris longer than is necessary for the preparation 
of maps.  
(iv) It is necessary to define clearly the 
responsibility of the patwari and police officer in 
respect of these maps.  
(v) The police officer will indicate to the patwari the 
limits of the land of which he desires map, and the 
topographical items to be shown therein. The 
patwari will then be responsible for drawing the 
maps correctly, by tracing, if necessary, the second 
copy, for making accurately on maps all these items 
and for entering on the maps due distances. He will 
not write on the map, intended for production as 
evidence in the court any explanations. The police 
officer may write any explanations on the traced 
copy of the map.  
(vi) It is for the police officer himself to add to the 
second copy of the map such remarks as may be 
necessary to explain the connection of the map with 
the case under inquiry. He is also responsible 
equally with the patwaris for the correctness of all 
distances, but on the copy of the map drawn by the 
patwari for presentation, in court he will make no 
remarks or explanations based on the statements of 
witnesses.  
(vii) It will be convenient if all the entries made by 
the patwari are made in black ink, and those added 
by the police officer in red ink.  
(viii) Patwaris will not in any case be required by a 
police officer to make a map of an inhabited 
enclosure or of land inside a town or village site. 
 
Similarly, Rule 33(5), Chapter-25, Volume-3 of the Punjab Police 
Rules, 1934, also requires the investigating officer to draw a correct plan 
of the scene of death including all features necessary to a right 
understanding of the case and Rule 35(4)(a) of the Rules ibid forms it as a 
part of the inquest report. This means that there is definitely some purpose 
behind the preparation of site plan. 
It is true that ocular account is given preference over the site plan 
yet there is a condition precedent that the ocular account must be cogent, 
trustworthy and not tainted, otherwise, site plan can be used to 
corroborate or contradict other evidence, because, it is used to give true 
picture and salient features of the occurrence. In the present case, the 
defence has denied the place of occurrence as well as presence of 
eyewitnesses at the spot. It is also noteworthy that the purported 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024. 
 
 
20
eyewitnesses have been duly confronted with site plan, which was 
prepared by the draftsman at the instructions of investigating officer and 
pointation of complainant as well as eyewitnesses. It can, therefore, be 
referred to determine the location of incident as well as respective 
positions of the deceased and the injured. Reliance in this respect is 
hereby placed upon the case-law titled as “Mst. Rukhsana Begum and 
others vs. Sajjad and others” (2017 SCMR 596). 
13. 
What to say about the untrustworthy, unreliable and tainted ocular 
account which is even not synchronized with medical evidence. 
According to the crime report (Exh.CW6/A), Muhammad Nawaz 
appellant has been burdened with the responsibility of making fire shots 
with his pistol, which landed on left arm and armpit of Salman Ali 
(deceased) but while appearing before the trial court, Sharafat Ali 
complainant (PW.1) and Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) have attributed only 
one pistol fire shot to Muhammad Nawaz appellant. Moreover, according 
to the statements of eyewitnesses, fire shot made by Muhammad Nawaz 
appellant had hit on left arm and armpit of Salman Ali (deceased) 
whereas, according to the post mortem report of Salman Ali (deceased) 
and statement of Dr. Mohsin Munawar (CW.9), entry wound was on the 
outer top right shoulder which is described as injury No.1-A. He (CW.9) 
further clarified in his cross-examination as under:-   
“It is correct that when single firearm foreign body made 
more than one injuries, then all those injuries are written as 
1-A, 1-B, 1-C and 1-D. It is correct that as per post mortem 
examination report all the four injuries are the result of one 
bullet. ” 
According to cross-examination on Ulfat Hayat, Inspector/I.O. 
(CW.10) the accused and the injured as well as deceased, as per site plan, 
were standing on a plain agriculture land, meaning thereby, the deceased 
and the appellant were standing at equal footing, whereas, Dr. Mohsin 
Munawar (CW.9) has disclosed in cross-examination that injury No.1-A 
is on upper part of body, whereas injuries No.1-B, 1-C and 1-D are on 
lower side of body. He admitted it correct that direction of injuries was in 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024. 
 
 
21
form of upward to downward. He also stated in his cross-examination as 
under:- 
“It is correct that possibility cannot be ruled out that the 
assailant was on the higher pedestal than the victim. ”     
Similarly, he (CW.9) also admitted in his cross-examination that in 
the whole post mortem report, it is not mentioned that entry wound was 
received by the deceased on his armpit. In the light of above, I am of the 
considered view that ocular account is not in unison with medical 
evidence, making the prosecution case further doubtful. A reference in 
this respect may be made to the cases of “Zahir Yousaf and another vs. 
The State and another” (2017 SCMR 2002), “Mian Sohail Ahmad and 
others vs. The State and others” (2019 SCMR 956) and “Khalid 
Mehmood and another vs. The State and others” (2021 SCMR 810).  
14. 
There is another significant fact that Sharafat Ali complainant 
(PW.1) and Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) made blatant and dishonest 
improvements to their earlier statements with which they were duly 
confronted and for the purpose of clarity, relevant lines from their cross-
examination highlighting those improvements are as under:- 
Sharafat Ali complainant (PW.1) 
“….Earlier my cursory statement was also recorded 
before the Court. I had stated in my cursory statement that 
I went to police station and moved application Ex-PA for 
registration of case. Confronted with cursory statement 
Ex/DA, wherein it is not so recorded. I had stated in my 
cursory statement that I identified dead body of my 
deceased brother at hospital on which I.O prepared memo 
of identification Ex-PB, attested by me, Maalik and Nasir 
PWs. Confronted with cursory statement Ex-DA, it is not 
so recorded. I had got recorded in my cursory statement 
that then I came back at police station and handed over 
my blood stained shirt (uniform) before the I.O, which he 
took into his possession vide recovery memo Ex-PC, 
attested by witnesses. Confronted with cursory statement 
Ex-DA, it is not so recorded. I also recorded in my 
cursory statement that then I went to dead house and 
received dead body of my brother through receipt Ex-PD, 
attested by me, Maalik and Nasir PWs and that I.O also 
recorded my statement u/s 161 of Cr.P.C. Confronted with 
cursory statement Ex-DA, wherein it is not so recorded”  
Muratab Ali (PW.2) 
“Police recorded my statement in this case. I had recorded 
in my statement before police u/s 161 Cr.P.C that at 01:30

recorded in my statement before police u/s 161 Cr.P.C. 
that after sometime, my brother Sharafat Ali on his own 
vehicle ACG-730 reached at the spot. Confronted with 
Ex-DB, wherein it is not so recorded in this form. I had 
recorded in my statement before police that I stepped 
ahead to save Salman Ali on which accused Muhammad 
Talal made fire-shot on me with his pistol which landed 
on my left thigh کو

is not so recorded in this form. I had recorded in my 
statement before police that my brother Sharafat Ali made 
call on mobile police emergency. Confronted with Ex-
DB, wherein it is not so recorded….”  
 
In a slew of decisions, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has declared 
that the witnesses are untrustworthy if they make dishonest improvements 
in their statements on material aspects of the case in order to fill up the 
lacunas and gaps in the prosecution case or to bring their statements in 
line with the other prosecution evidence. Reference in this respect may be 
made to the judgments of Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as “Mst. 
Saima Noreen and another vs. The State” (2024 SCMR 1310) and 
“Muhammad Jahangir and another vs. The State and others” (2024 
SCMR 1741). 
15. 
Learned counsel for the complainant has also drawn the attention of 
this Court towards an application submitted by Muhammad Nawaz 
appellant to the Superintendent of Police (Investigation), Cantt, Lahore, 
for registration of cross version wherein it has been narrated by 
Muhammad Nawaz appellant that on 21.11.2021 at 01:30 p.m. he along 
with his son namely Talal was working in his fields, when his paternal 
cousins namely Muratab Ali injured (PW.2), Salman Ali (since deceased) 
and Sakhawat Ali armed with hatchets and sota entered in the fields while 
abusing and raising lalkara that the appellant should be taught a lesson for 
stopping them from irrigating the crops with dirty water to the crops, 
therefore, he should not be spared. The appellant requested that they will 
resolve the matter amicably but in the meantime Sakhawat Ali, who was 
armed with hatchet, made a hatchet blow from the front side. The

appellant saved his head from the blow and raised his right hand in the air, 
upon which, the hatchet blow was landed on his right hand and the same 
was injured. Salman Ali (since deceased) also made straight hatchet blow 
which landed on his right arm, thereafter, Salman Ali (since deceased) 
again made hatchet blow which landed on the chest of the appellant and 
upon receipt of those injuries, he fell down. When son of the appellant 
namely Talal tried to rescue him, the supra-mentioned persons gave fists, 
kicks and sotas blows to Talal. In order to save his life, he (Talal) ran 
away from the spot, whereupon, Salman Ali (since deceased) made two 
hatchet blows from the back side which landed on the back of appellant. 
Thereafter the appellant took out his licensed pistol from the box of 
tractor in order to save his life and made aerial firing and extended threats 
and because of the injury on his right hand made firing with his left hand 
then the bullet was stuck in the pistol. In the meantime, Sakhawat Ali 
(jettisoned PW) asked to first snatch his pistol and then done him to death 
with his own pistol, upon which the above mentioned PWs suddenly 
attempted to snatch the pistol from the appellant and during the scuffle the 
appellant made attempt to retrieve the bullet from the pistol which was 
stuck in the chamber of pistol. The above mentioned PWs tried to snatch 
the pistol but due to pressing the trigger fire went off. When the PWs did 
not get the pistol from the appellant then Muratab Ali made hatchet blow 
from the front side which landed on the head of the appellant. Upon 
receipt of those injuries the appellant fell down and became unconscious. 
The occurrence was witnessed by Ghaffar son of Muhammad Hussain and 
Talal (son of the appellant). Thereafter the appellant was shifted to nearby 
Health Centre namely Awan Dhai Wala, Lahore, for medical treatment. It 
was also alleged that during scuffle for snatching pistol, one fire hit 
Salman Ali which resulted in his death.   
 
Learned counsel for the complainant has contended that although 
said application has not been exhibited but the same is available on 
judicial file and this Court for the sake of justice can look into its contents 
according to which the defence has admitted the occurrence. He has also

placed reliance upon the case-law titled as “Muhammad Azam vs. 
Muhammad Iqbal and others” (PLD 1984 SC 95). 
 
There is no cavil to the proposition that for safe administration of 
justice and fair play, the Court can look into the averments of any 
document which is available on judicial file but at the same time, it does 
not mean that the contents of the same can be referred in the judgment 
because it is a well settled principle of law that the document, which has 
not been produced and exhibited in evidence, cannot be read and relied 
upon. In case titled as “Mazhar Iqbal vs. The State and another” (2022 
MLD 752) it has been held as under:- 
 “It is a well settled law that document which has not been 
exhibited, cannot be read in the evidence. It is also settled 
that no conviction can be based upon the evidence which 
has not been put to accused in his statement under Section 
342, Cr.P.C. In this regard, reliance is placed on a case 
titled as "State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan and 
another v. Javaid Iqbal" (2011 SCMR 1013), wherein it 
has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
that:  
"We are not convinced that, such document, which 
has not been produced and proved in evidence but 
only "marked", can be taken into account by the 
Courts as a legal evidence of a fact.” 
16. 
Now coming to the objection of complainant’s counsel that the trial 
court has wrongly exhibited the photocopy of Rapat No.11 dated 
21.11.2021 as Exh.DE, despite the objection of complainant’s counsel and 
the same should be brush aside. It is not disputed that the photocopy of 
any document cannot be exhibited and read in evidence except as a 
secondary evidence. It is true that in absence of any evidence with regard 
to loss of any document, photocopy of the same even if taken on record 
and exhibited without any objection would not qualify the document as 
admissible in evidence, in this way, I agree with the contention of learned 
counsel for the complainant that the trial court has wrongly exhibited 
photocopy of Rapat No.11 dated 21.11.2011 as Exh.DE but at the same 
time, I have also taken into account that Amjad Shakeel 9036/C (CW.7) 
and Ulfat Hayat, Inspector/I.O. (CW.10) who were posted at police station 
Manawan on the day of occurrence, have categorically admitted in their

cross-examination that Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) was admitted in 
Services Hospital, Lahore, on 21.11.2021 at 01.15 p.m. and Moharrar 
Chowki of police post Services Hospital informed telephonically at the 
police station about the admission of Muratab Ali in injured condition. 
Relevant portion of cross-examination upon Amjad Shakeel 9036/HC 
(CW.7) is hereby reproduced as under:- 
“It is correct that vide Rapat No. 11 dated 21.11.2021 
roznamcha of our police station, a telephonic message was 
received at 01.15 p.m. from the Services Hospital, Lahore 
through Tallat Muharrer police post service hospital that 
Muratab son of Yousaf is admitted in the Services Hospital 
vide COD No. 8422934 in injured condition, so any 
investigating officer may be deputed. Abdul Majeed ASI 
was deputed for said purpose (At this stage, learned defence 
counsel requested to place on record copy of Rapat No. 11 
dated 21.11.2021, which is objected by learned counsel for 
the complainant. Since, Rapat in question is relevant to 
instant controversy, therefore, copy of Rapat No. 11 is 
placed on  record as Exh. DE.”  
Similarly, Ulfat Hayat, Inspector (CW.10) being the investigating 
officer was well aware about the facts concerning to the case and he has 
also conceded regarding the admission of Muratab Ali (PW.2) in injured 
condition in Services Hospital, Lahore as well as the information in this 
respect made at Police Station Manawan by Moharrar Chowki Services 
Hospital, Lahore on 21.11.2021 at 01.15 p.m. Relevant lines of his cross-
examination read as under:-  
“It is correct that in the Roznamcha vide Rapat No. 11 
dated 21.11.2021 at 01.15 p.m it is written that at 01.15 
p.m. Muharrer chowki Services Hospital lodged report 
through telephone that one Muratab Ali son of Muhammad 
Yousaf aged 42 years is admitted in the COD No. 8422934 
in injured condition in Services Hospital, hence, 
investigating officer be deputed and on the basis of said 
telephonic message said Rapat was incorporated in the 
Roznamcha and Abdul Majeed ASI was informed in this 
respect. I have not written throughout the investigation qua 
to Rapat No. 11 dated 21.11.2021 that Muratab Ali was 
injured prior to 01.15 p.m. dated 21.11.2021 that Murtab 
Ali was injured prior to 01.15 p.m. dated 21.11.2021 and 
was shifted to hospital prior to present occurrence. I did 
not obtain any MLC of injured Muratab Ali on 21.11.2021 
concerning to COD No. 84422934 from Services Hospital, 
Lahore 
 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024. 
 
 
26
It is noteworthy that when it has been clearly mentioned in the 
crime report (Exh.CW6/A) that Muratab Ali injured PW2 was taken to 
Services Hospital, Lahore in injured condition for the purpose of 
treatment then this fact is sufficient to hold that Rapat No.11 dated 
21.11.2021 was entered at Police Station Manawan. Although it was 
incumbent upon the prosecution to prove that Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) 
was not admitted in Services Hospital, Lahore on 21.11.2021 at 01.15 
p.m. but the prosecution witnesses themselves have conceded about the 
admission of Muratab Ali injured (PW.2) in the Services Hospital, 
Lahore. I have also observed that the whole prosecution evidence is silent 
on the point that Muratab Ali (PW.2) was admitted in the Services 
Hospital after 02.00 p.m. on 21.11.2021. As the witnesses namely Amjad 
Shakeel 9036/HC (CW.7) and Ulfat Hayat, Inspector/ I.O. (CW.10) have 
admitted in their evidence that Muratab Ali (PW.2) was admitted in 
Services Hospital at 01.15 p.m. on 21.11.2024, in this way, defence 
version is proved that the occurrence had not taken place at the time 
alleged by the prosecution. 
 
17. 
Now coming to the stance of learned counsel for the complainant 
that the evidence regarding the occurrence deposed by the eyewitnesses in 
their examination-in-chief on some material aspects has not been cross-
examined by the defence, for the reason, the portion of uncross-examined 
evidence should be admitted as correct. In this context, I have observed 
that record clearly reflects that the defence has taken the plea that the 
occurrence has not taken place as stated by the prosecution in crime report 
(Exh.CW6/A) rather the complainant party assaulted upon the accused 
party at their Dera and caused injuries to them.  
So far as the case-laws referred by learned counsel for the 
complainant about the above-mentioned proposition are concerned, the 
same are not relevant because every criminal case is to be decided on the 
basis of totality of impressions gathered from the circumstances of the 
case and not on the narrow ground of cross-examination. Even otherwise 
the point agitated by learned counsel for the complainant is applicable in 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024. 
 
 
27
the civil cases and not in criminal cases. Guidance in this respect has been 
sought from the cases reported as “Juwarsing and others v. The State of 
Madhya Pradesh” (AIR 1981 Supreme Court 373) and “Nadeem 
Ramzan v. The State” (2018 SCMR 149).  
 
Similarly in case of “Mst. Asia Bibi vs. The State and others” (PLD 
2019 Supreme Court 64) it has been held as under:- 
“In this regard it is important to note that this Court has 
held that the principle, namely, the part of the statement 
which remains un-rebutted amounts to admission, does 
not attract in criminal cases. In criminal cases, the 
burden to prove the guilt of the accused rests heavily 
upon the prosecution, who has to prove its case beyond 
any shadow of doubt. Reliance in this behalf may be 
made to judgments of this Court reported as Nadeem 
Ramzan v. the State (2018 SCMR 149), S. Mahmood 
Aslam Shah v. the State (PLD 1987 SC 250) and State v. 
Rab Nawaz and another (PLD 1974 SC 87). Thus, the 
learned High Court has erred in law while deciding this 
aspect of the matter.” 
18. 
Another argument of learned counsel for the complainant is that the 
defence has taken a specific plea during the cross-examination upon the 
PWs, which it failed to prove, for the reason, inference can be drawn 
against the defence. It is well settled by now that general principle in 
criminal jurisprudence is that the prosecution has to stand on its own legs 
and this burden does not shift from prosecution even if accused takes up 
any particular plea and fails to prove it. Reliance can be placed upon the 
case-laws titled as “Hakim Ali and four others vs. The State and another” 
(1971 SCMR 432) and “Ashiq Hussain vs. The State” (1993 SCMR 417).   
19. 
With regard to the recovery of pistol (P-6) taken into possession 
vide recovery memo Exh.CW2/C on 28.12.2021 at the pointation of 
appellant from his Dera situated at Lakhodair and positive report of PFSA 
(Exh.PH), I have noticed that Ulfat Hayat, Inspector/I.O. (CW10) has 
admitted in his cross-examination that on 06.12.2021 after 15 days of the 
occurrence he sent blood stained earth, crime empties  and live bullets, 
parcel seven in number to the PFSA for analysis. The above highlighted 
unexplained delay in sending the crime empties to the office of Punjab 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024. 
 
 
28
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, creates a reasonable doubt qua the 
authenticity of this corroborative evidence against the appellant. Reliance 
is placed upon the case-law reported as “Muhammad Farooq and another 
vs. The State” (2006 SCMR 1707). 
Furthermore, he (CW.10) also admitted that from 21.11.2021 till 
the completion of investigation of the case, there is no mentioning in the 
Roznamcha that he handed over the parcel to Moharrar and deposited the 
same in the Office of PFSA. In the attending circumstances, safe custody 
of pistol P-6 and its transmission to the office of PFSA becomes highly 
doubtful, therefore, recovery of pistol (P-6) and its positive report of 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PH) is inconsequential to 
the prosecution case.  
 
Apart from the above, it is an admitted position of the case that in 
column No.23 of the inquest report (Exh.CW10/A), no crime empty has 
been shown present near the dead body, albeit in the recovery memo 
(Exh.CW3/A) and site plan (Exh.CW10/E), thirteen empty cartridges had 
been shown recovered lying very close to the dead body of deceased. This 
deliberate omission creates further reasonable doubts regarding the 
credibility of recovery of weapon of offence as well as PFSA report as 
held by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case-law titled as “Mst. 
Rukhsana Begum and others vs. Sajjad and others” (2017 SCMR 596). 
20. 
   Now the only piece of evidence which still remains in the field is 
the motive advanced by the prosecution behind the unfortunate incident, 
which, as per prosecution case was that the complainant party forbade the 
accused from diverting the flow of water in the land of the complainant 
party as they were sowing wheat crop. I have noted that prosecution has 
failed to prove the alleged motive and the PWs have not produced any 
cogent or convincing evidence to prove the same. Similarly, Ulfat Hayat, 
Inspector/I.O. (CW.10) has admitted this fact in his cross-examination. In 
this view of the matter, the trial court has rightly disbelieved the motive 
part. Even otherwise, law is quite settled by now that if the prosecution 
asserts a motive but fails to prove the same, then such failure on the part 
of prosecution may react against a sentence of death/life on the charge of 

 
 
Crl. Appl. No. 83167 of 2023, 
Crl. Appl. No. 2404 of 2024 &  
Crl. Rev. No. 2407 of 2024. 
 
 
29
murder and reliance in this regard can be placed upon the cases reported 
by the  Supreme Court of Pakistan as “Muhammad Hassan and another 
vs. The State and others” (2024 SCMR 1427), “Iftikhar Hussain alias 
Kharoo vs. The State” (2024 SCMR 1449) and “Muhammad Jahangir 
and another vs. The State and others” (2024 SCMR 1741).  
21. 
 After analyzing the prosecution case from every angle, I have 
concluded that the case against the appellant is replete with doubts and his 
conviction and sentence cannot be upheld on the basis of such a shaky and 
untrustworthy evidence. The  apex Court of the country has time and again 
held that in the event of a doubt, its benefit must be given to the accused 
not as a matter of grace, but as of right. Reliance is placed upon case laws 
titled as “Sajjad Hussain vs. The State and others” (2022 SCMR 1540) 
and “Saghir Ahmad vs. The State and others” (2023 SCMR 241).  
22. 
For the foregoing reasons, Criminal Appeal No.83167 of 2023 is 
accepted and Muhammad Nawaz appellant is acquitted of the charge by 
extending the benefit of doubt to him. Muhammad Nawaz appellant is in 
jail; he be released forthwith if not required in any other case.  
23. 
As a natural corollary, Criminal Appeal No.2404 of 2024 filed 
against the acquittal of Muhammad Talal respondent No.1 and Criminal 
Revision No. 2407 of 2024 preferred by Sharafat Ali complainant for 
enhancement of sentence and compensation amount are dismissed.
