Mr. Amjad Iqbal Khan, Advocate for the complainant/respondent No.2.  
 
 
Through instant petition, Syed Muhammad Ali (petitioner/accused) has sought 
post-arrest bail in case arising out of F.I.R. No.1042/2024 dated: 03.02.2024 
registered under Section: 489-F PPC at Police Station: Raiwind City, District: Lahore.  
 
2.   
After hearing learned counsel for the parties, learned Deputy District Public 
Prosecutor and going through the available record with their able assistance, it has 
been noticed that briefly, as per Crime Report (F.I.R.) got recorded by Syed Tallat 
Imran (complainant), he had to take Rs.32,00,000/- (Rupees thirty two hundred 
thousands only) from Syed Muhammad Ali  (accused in the case, now petitioner) 
and he (present petitioner) issued cheque of Rs.32,00,000/- to the complainant 
which was dishonoured on presentation by the bank.  
Undeniably, Section: 489-F PPC was brought on the statute for the purpose 
of awarding punishment to the person, who issues the cheque dishonestly for 
repayment of a loan or fulfilment of an “obligation”, which is dishonoured on 
presentation; for the purpose of ready reference, Section: 489-F PPC is hereby 
reproduced: - 
“489-F PPC Dishonestly issuing a cheque.--Whoever  
dishonestly issues a cheque towards re-payment of a loan or 
fulfilment of an obligation which is dishonoured on 
presentation, shall be punishable with imprisonment which 
may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both, unless 
can establish, for which the burden of proof shall rest on him, 
that he had made arrangements with his bank to ensure that 
the cheque would be honoured and that the bank was at fault 
in not honouring the cheque.”   
             (emphasis added) 
 
Bare perusal of aforementioned provision of law reflects that for invoking Section: 
489-F PPC, mere issuance of cheque or its dishonouring is not sufficient rather 
first of all it will have to be proved as a “must” that cheque was issued for 
repayment of loan or fulfilment of obligation, meaning thereby that there must be 
material available on the record to show loan or obligation. 
On Court’s query, learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor under 
instructions of investigating officer of the case (present before the Court) and after 

Crl. Misc. No.18392-B/2024

herself going through available record apprises that though it is mentioned in the 
first information report that complainant had to take Rs.32,00,000/- from the 
petitioner yet during entire investigation of the case, it has not come on the record 
that when, before whom and for which reason as well as for what purpose, said 
amount was given by the complainant to the petitioner and how it was due to 
complainant from the petitioner, therefore, applicability of Section: 489-F PPC in 
this case itself requires further probe/inquiry within the purview of sub-Section (2) 
of Section: 497 Cr.P.C. 
It goes without saying that Section: 489-F PPC was not brought on the 
statute for using the same as a tool for recovery of the amount rather for the 
purpose of awarding punishment to the person, who issues the cheque dishonestly 
for payment of a loan or fulfilment of an “obligation”, which is dishonoured on 
presentation. Although cheque involving huge amount has been dishonoured in the 
case yet punishment for the offence under Section: 489-F PPC is three years, or 
fine, or both and of course said punishment does not fall within the ambit of 
prohibition contained in Section: 497 Cr.P.C.; grant of bail in such like cases is a 
rule and refusal is an exception.   
 
Though it is contention of learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor that 
case was registered on 03.02.2024, non-bailable warrants of arrest of the petitioner 
were issued on 08.02.2024, proclamation against him was issued on 15.02.2024 
whereas challan report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. for proceedings under Section: 
512 Cr.P.C. was submitted on 17.02.2024 yet at the same time apprises that 
petitioner was arrested in this case on 08.03.2024 and sent to jail on 09.03.2024 
where he is confined till now. Since proclamation was issued on 15.02.2024, and 
period in the proclamation for appearance of the accused cannot be less than 30 
days as per statute and admittedly petitioner was arrested on 08.03.2024 i.e. before 
expiry of said period, therefore, he cannot be termed as proclaimed offender; in 
this regard, case of “Waheed alias Naheed versus The State and another” 
(2013 YLR 335) and  “Nasir Khan and others versus State and another” {PLJ 
2014 Cr.C. (Lahore) 659 (DB)} can be referred.  
 
Even otherwise, if Court has come to the conclusion that case of the 
prosecution against the accused requires further probe/inquiry, then bail is granted 
to him as of right and same cannot be withheld due to abscondance; in this regard, 
case of “QAMAR alias MITHO versus THE STATE and others” (PLD 2012 
Supreme Court 222), “CHAIRMAN NAB through PGA NAB Islamabad 
versus MUHAMMAD KHALID” (2016 SCMR 676),  “MUKARAM versus 
The STATE and another” (2020 SCMR 956) and “SAEED YOUSAF versus 

Crl. Misc. No.18392-B/2024 
   
3 
 
The STATE and another” (2021 SCMR 1295), “SAAD ZIA versus The 
STATE and others” (2023 SCMR 1898) and “ABDUL RASHEED versus The 
STATE and another” (2023 SCMR 1948) can be advantageously referred.  
  
Petitioner was arrested in the case on 08.03.2024 and sent to jail on 
09.03.2024 where he is confined till now. Mere detention of the petitioner in 
jail would serve no useful purpose to the case of prosecution. It is trite law that 
bail cannot be withheld as advance punishment. 
3.  
When all aforementioned factors are taken into consideration in totality, 
then case for grant of post-arrest bail to the petitioner/accused has been made out. 
Therefore, instant petition filed by the petitioner is accepted/allowed and he is 
admitted to post-arrest bail in the case subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the 
sum of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees five hundred thousand only) with two sureties each 
in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial court.  
4. 
It goes without saying that observations mentioned above are just tentative 
in nature, strictly confined to the disposal of instant bail petition and will have no 
bearing upon trial of the case, which will be concluded on its own merits by the 
trial court expeditiously. Needless to add that if petitioner or any other person 
acting on his behalf creates any hurdle in the way of conclusion of trial, then 
complainant as well as the State would be at liberty to move for recalling of this 
order.
