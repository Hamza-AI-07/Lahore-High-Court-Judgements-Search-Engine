JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing:  20.11.2025 
Appellant by: 
Malik 
Muhammad 
Shahzad

Advocate. 
Mr. Muhammad Suleman Bhatti, Advocate 
in ITR No. 29/2024. 
 
 
 
Respondent by: Mr. Muhammad Imran Ghazi, Advocate.  
 
ASIM HAFEEZ, J. This and Income Tax Reference 
applications bearing I.T.R Nos. 49/22 and 29/2024 (‘Applications’) 
are heard and decided though this single judgment, in wake of 
commonality of the questions of law raised for soliciting our opinion, 
which questions read as follows, 
i) 
“Whether 
on 
the 
facts 
and 
in 
the 
circumstances of the case, the learned 
Appellate Inland Revenue (ATIR) was justified 
to ignore that gift received otherwise through 
banking channel is rightly treated as income 
of the taxpayer?” 
 
ii) 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances 
of the case, the learned Appellate Tribunal 
Inland Revenue was justified to ignore the 
requirements of Section 39(3) of the Income 
Tax Ordinance, 2001, is mandatory in 
nature?”

2. 
 Incidentally, there is an element of commonality of facts as 
well – in these cases son(s) had claimed gifts from father(s) and 
explained those transaction(s), either as source of investment or 
payments received in cash. Plea of the Applicant department is that 
amounts received as gift(s), otherwise than by a crossed cheque 
drawn on a bank or through banking channel, are per se treatable / 
taxable as ‘Income from other Sources’ and no further explanation is 
essential to determine the taxability of those gifts, which are non-
compliant in terms of section 39(3) of the Income Tax Ordinance 
2001 (‘Ordinance’). 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel representing respondent(s) – 
donee(s) – submit that taxpayer(s) is entitled to an opportunity to 
explain and substantiate that why transaction of gift was not effected 
as per the requirement(s) of section 39(3) of the Ordinance. Adds 
that provision(s) for offering explanation is inbuilt in the mechanism 
provided for amendment of assessment, either by way of mandatory 
notice under section 122(9) of the Ordinance, read with sub-section 
(5) or (5A) of section 122 of the Ordinance, as the case may be and 
factum of taxability of the receipt of gift(s) and treatment thereof is 
subject to factual explanations under section 111 of the Ordinance. It 
is emphasized that gifts effected between close relations, like, 
parents and offspring(s) and spouses, create as exception to the 
categorization of gift done through section 39(3) of the Ordinance.   
Analysis.  
4. 
Notably, one of the Reference applications bearing I.T.R 
No.49/2022, which arose out of ITR No.60/MB/2020, relates to Tax 

I.T.R No. 48 of 2022

year 2020, and preceded amendment made in section 39(l) of the 
Ordinance by virtue of Finance Act 2019, whereby clause (la) was 
inserted and it reads as; 
“subject to sub-section (3), any amount or fair 
market value of any property received without 
consideration or received as gift, other than gift 
received from relative as defined in sub-section 
(5) of section 85. 
 
5. 
Fundamental issue is whether classification and taxability of 
alleged transaction of gift would be determined on the basis of 
factual explanation(s) offered by the taxpayer or the Ordinance, in 
terms of section 39(3) thereof, had predetermined the taxability of 
non-compliant gift(s) as income from other source(s). We are dealing 
with machinery provision and not a charging one - Section 39 of the 
Ordinance. 
  
There is no cavil that what constitutes an income; manner of 
categorization of income and conditionalities to be met for 
determining the taxability of transaction of gift are determinable 
under statutory dispensation – Income Tax Ordinance 2001, in 
present context. Section 39(3) of the Ordinance prescribes that the 
amounts received as gift(s), otherwise than by a crossed cheque 
drawn on a bank or through banking channel, are per se taxable as 
income from other sources. Statutory conditions always determine 
the taxability of transaction, either as income or otherwise. And 
taxpayer was not the arbiter of such determination. Courts / tribunals 
have always treated statutory characterization of transaction(s) by 
law as conclusive and final. Notwithstanding, these settled principles, 
governing the gift(s), conventionally our courts had extended benefit 

I.T.R No. 48 of 2022 
4
of convenience to the transactions of gift, between spouses and 
parents / children, rather a special treatment, i.e., an exception to the 
otherwise regimented classification of transaction of gift under 
section 39(3) of the Ordinance – conventional wisdom was based on 
the presumption that gift by a husband to wife is not and cannot 
always be routed through the banking channel – [and if letter of the 
law is strictly applied then every obligation of dower gift in shape of 
cash, has to be performed through the banking channel]. Context of 
the gift between prescribed relations, for the purposes of present 
enactment, is a relevant and crucial fact. Cultural set-up, social 
norms, dwindling literacy ratios and limited familiarity or ease with 
banking procedures are few factors that led to the concessions 
extended vis-à-vis gifts between spouses – only concession extended 
was that notwithstanding non-compliant to the conditionalities of 
section 39(3) of the Ordinance, transaction was treated as gift, which 
certainly was subjected to review / scrutiny.  
6. 
Evidently, the benefit(s) extended by the courts / tribunals, in 
lieu of gifts exchanged between spouses was granted statutory 
recognition by legislature upon addition of clause (la) to section 39(1) 
of the Ordinance – scope of relatives was extended in terms of sub-
section (5) of section 85 of the Ordinance. This statutory recognition, 
vis-à-vis and to the extent of receiving gifts from certain classes of 
relatives, has created an exception to mechanism provided for 
qualifying gifts under section 39(3) of the Ordinance, whereby 
statutory classification of gift, subject to the manner of performance, 
was conclusively determined. After introduction of clause (la) of 

I.T.R No. 48 of 2022 
5
section 39(1) of the Ordinance, an exception / nonconformity has 
been created in context of receiving of gifts from the relations 
prescribed. For the purposes of clarity, clause (la) of section 39(1) of 
the Ordinance has changed position qua classification of gift, from 
statutory classification to factual classification - [opportunity 
extended to the taxpayer to establish factum of gift, between 
permitted relations, outside the banking channel]. Pertinently 
mentioned, gifts outside the circle of relatives, defined in sub-section 
(5) of section 85 of the Ordinance, are and would continue to be 
subjected to the conditionalities prescribed in section 39(3) of the 
Ordinance. 
7. 
Now the question is what is the scope of the amendment, by 
way of clause (la) of Section 39(1) of the Ordinance, brought 
through Finance Act 2019 [applicable from 1st July 2019], and 
whether same can be read retrospectively?  
  
Section 39(3) of the Ordinance and exception created by virtue 
of clause (la) of section 39(1) of the Ordinance fall within the 
category of machinery provision(s) – providing for assessment of tax 
-, and especially the latter one being beneficial, hence, has to be 
construed accordingly. There is no cavil that retrospective effect 
could be extended to machinery provisions, where context and 
legislative intent so permit. Additionally, provisions under reference 
are procedural in scope and effect, which provides a mechanism for 
determining the liability and not creating liability – In case of 
“Commissioner of Income Tax, Peshawar Vs. Messrs Islamic Investment 
Bank Ltd” (2016 SCMR 816) Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that 

I.T.R No. 48 of 2022 
6
“……When a provision is incorporated in any statute through an amendment that 
is procedural in nature then the retrospective rule of construction is to be applied 
to such provision.”.  
  
Even otherwise clause (la) of section 39(1) of the Ordinance in 
fact introduces uniformity, brings clarity in the context of gifts 
received under parental and spousal relations and indicates an 
apparent intent to remove inconsistency – at times legislature(s) 
introduces laws to address mischief, harmonize it with existing 
provisions, intending conformity with and to concretize judicial 
precedents. Is branding of clause (la) of section 39(1) of the 
Ordinance as remedial provision permissible. This can be explained 
in the context of decision in the case of “Collector of Sales Tax and 
Central Excise, LTU, Karachi Vs. Messrs Pak Suzuki Co. Ltd., Karachi” 
(2016 PTD 867), whereby Hon’ble Supreme Court, while dilating upon 
the rule of interpretation of Remedial and Curative enactments, relied 
upon an excerpt from Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. 82, which reads as, 
“In construing remedial statutes, regard should be had to the 
former law, the defects or evils to be cured or abolished, or the 
mischief to be remedied, and the remedy provided; and they 
should be interpreted liberally to embrace all cases fairly within 
their scope, so as to accomplish the object of the legislature, and 
to effectuate the purpose of the statute; by suppressing the 
mischief and advancing the remedy, provided it can be done by 
reasonable construction in furtherance of the object.”      
 
8. 
There is no cavil that clause (la) of section 39(1) of the 
Ordinance, upon purposive interpretation, intended redressal of 
mischief – difficulty encountered in context of gifts received from 
parents or between spouses. This brings amendment within the scope 
of a remedial statutes. Ordinarily, section 39(3) of the Ordinance 

I.T.R No. 48 of 2022 
7
prescribes mechanism for effecting gifts, for the purposes of 
Ordianance, and clause (la) of section 39(1) of the Ordinance creates 
an exception – [that is the only purpose intended to be achieved 
otherwise there was no occasion for providing exclusion through 
clause (la) of section 39(1) of the Ordinance].  
  
Is there any prejudice caused by expanding the effect of clause 
(la) of section 39(1) of the Ordinance, retrospectively. We see no 
prejudice being caused by reading clause (la) of section 39(1) of the 
Ordinance, in the context of gifts received from relatives, explained 
in sub-section (5) of section 85 of the Ordinance, retrospectively. 
Extending retrospective effect to clause (la) of section 39(1) of the 
Ordinance would neither suggest nor imply that mere assertion on 
the part of taxpayer or inclusion of any amount as gift in declaration 
/ return of income would absolve the taxpayer, or for that matter the 
donor, collaterally, – within the sphere of relatives explained in sub-
section (5) of section 85 of the Ordinance – from otherwise 
substantiating factum/transaction of gift, legality thereof and 
otherwise its genuineness. Whether amount(s) received is a gift or 
income, it still depends upon the factual characterization of the 
transaction, subject to inquiry conducted under assessment-review 
jurisdiction – Assessing officer would still be competent to 
recharacterize transaction if gift, outside banking channel, as income 
if same was not proved / substantiated. There is no escape from a 
fact-based inquiry, to be undertaken by the department to determine 
that whether transaction claimed is a gift or not?  

I.T.R No. 48 of 2022

9. 
We, therefore, dismiss the argument that gifts between the 
prescribed relations, defined in clause (la) of section 39(1) of the 
Ordinance, would per se be treated or taxable as income from other 
sources and add a caveat that gift(s) claimed in the context of 
amended clause would still be subject to inquiry / scrutiny and upon 
being unsatisfied, Assessing officer is competent to re-characterize 
receipt of amount as income, instead of gift.      
10. 
Now we examine the order(s) of Appellate Tribunal to see 
whether transactions claimed as gift(s), are actually gifts or tool(s) to 
conceal their true character. We found that element and extent of 
fact-based inquiry, in each case, is conspicuous by its absence - 
Tribunal though declared transactions as gift(s) but without any 
reasoning or justification qua the obligation of taxpayer to 
substantiate that transactions were in essence gift(s); provisioning of 
proper documents; proof that donor(s) has had the financial capacity 
/ resources to make gifts to the extent of the sums involved – records 
pertaining to tax records and business accounts - and primarily the 
intention to gift and documents establishing irrevocability of gift, etc. 
So many questions surfaced but remained unanswered, let alone 
attended. Additionally, there are no specific findings qua the conduct 
of the taxpayer/donee, that whether transaction of gift was disclosed, 
voluntarily, and if not, the effect thereof. These findings are essential 
to factually establish that transactions of gifts were genuinely 
transacted inter se donor and donee, as gifts. 
11. 
In these circumstances, we set aside the order(s), respectively 
passed by the Tribunal, and remand matters for redetermination that 

I.T.R No. 48 of 2022 
9
whether factum of gift(s) is established / substantiated by the 
taxpayer. Tribunal shall consider claim of gift(s) received in the 
context of retroactive application of clause (la) of section 39(1) of 
the Ordinance, but subject to proof of conducting transaction and 
genuineness thereof. Instant and connected reference applications are 
allowed in aforesaid terms. 
12. 
 Office shall send a copy of this order, under seal of the Court, 
to learned Appellate Tribunal, in terms of sub-section (8) of section 
133 of the Ordinance.
