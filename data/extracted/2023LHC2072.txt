------------------------ 
 
 
AALIA NEELUM, J:- The appellant-Muhammad Nasir 
alias Bhola, son of Rasheed Ahmad, caste Rajput, resident of Street No.10, 
Mohallah Jamil Park, District Faisalabad, was involved in case F.I.R. 
No.876 of 2018, dated 08.11.2018, an offence under Section 302 P.P.C., 
registered at P.S. Jhang Bazar, District Faisalabad and was tried by the 
learned Sessions Judge, District Faisalabad. The trial court seized with the 
matter in terms of the judgment dated 17.04.2019, convicted Muhammad 
Nasir @ Bhola (the appellant) under Section 302(b) PPC, and sentenced 
him to Death for committing Qatl-e-Amd of Shabana Kausar (the deceased), 
with the direction to pay compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- to the legal heirs of 
the deceased as envisaged under section 544-A of Cr.P.C and in case of 
default thereof, to further undergo 06-months imprisonment.   
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial court, 
Muhammad Nasir alias Bhola, the appellant has assailed his conviction by 
filing the instant appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No.44570 of 2019. The 

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019

learned trial court also referred M.R. No.104 of 2019 (The State. Vs. 
Muhammad Nasir @ Bhola) to confirm the death sentence awarded to the 
appellant-Muhammad Nasir alias Bhola. The matters arising from the same 
judgment of the learned trial court are being disposed of through a single 
judgment.  
3. 
 
The prosecution story, as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex. PD/1) lodged 
on the written application (Ex.PD) of Shahid Ali-the complainant (PW-6), is 
that he was resident of Chak No.60-JB and her sister, namely Mst. Shabana 
Kausar, aged about 18/20 years, was married to Muhammad Rasheed 
Ahmad, and during their wedlock, four daughters and one son were born, but 
his sister’s husband expired two years back. On the fateful date at about 3:00 
P.M, he (PW-6), along with Shahid Imran (PW-8) and Muhammad Ashraf 
(PW-7), went to see his sister in Street No.10, Mohallah Jamil Park, and 
were talking with his sister. In the meanwhile, the appellant Nasir, while 
armed with a pistol 30-bore, forcibly entered the house of his sister and 
raised Lalkara that he (the appellant) would teach her a lesson for not 
contracting marriage with him and made fire shots at her face to kill her, 
which hit on her head and mouth, who fell on the ground in an injured 
condition. While brandishing his pistol, the appellant fled away from the 
place of occurrence by extending threats to the complainant and PWs. The 
motive behind the occurrence was that the appellant used to tease and cause 
harassment to his sister and was forcing her to enter into a marriage. Due to 
the refusal of her sister, the appellant murdered his sister.  
4. 
 
After the occurrence, the complainant reported the matter to the 
police through the written application (Ex.PD); after that, formal F.I.R 
(Ex.PD/1) was chalked out by Muhammad Naveed Aslam No.4232-HC 
(PW-2). After registration of this case, the investigation was conducted by 
Idrees Iqbal, S.I (PW-10), who, having found the accused/appellant guilty, 
prepared a report under Section 173, Cr.P.C., and sent the same to the court 
of competent jurisdiction. On 18.03.2019, the learned trial court formally 
charged the appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In 

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019

support of its version, the prosecution produced as many as ten (10) 
witnesses.  
5. 
 
Ocular account, in this case, has come out from the statements 
of Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7), and 
Shahid Imran (PW-8), whereas Dr. Sadia Farooq, Women Medical Officer 
(PW-1), conducted postmortem examination on the dead body of the 
deceased-Shabana Kausar and found the following injuries on her person: - 
INJURIES 
1) 
A lacerated wound measuring 3 cm x 
1.5 cm muscle deep on the left side of 
face 1.5 cm from the angle of mouth, 3 
cm from chin.  
2-A) 
A lacerated firearm wound measuring 3 
cm x 2 cm on the left angle of the 
mouth,

the tongue was damaged, the skull base 
was damaged, eggshell was fractured of 
skull. Brain and spinal cord damage.  
OPINION 
 
In my opinion, the cause of death, in this case, was due 
to injuries.No.2 and 3, which caused damage to the brain and 
spinal cord. These injuries were sufficient to cause death in the 
ordinary course of nature. Injuries No.2 and 3 were inflicted by 

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019 
 
4
firearm means, and injury No.1 was inflicted by blunt means. 
Injury No.1 was also an ante-mortem.  
The statements of the remaining prosecution witnesses are 
formal in nature.  
6. 
 
On 10.04.2019, the learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor 
gave up PW Mujahid Ali as unnecessary, and on 12.04.2019, after tendering 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore regarding D.N.A and Serology 
Analysis report (Ex. PL, Ex. PL/1) and the report of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore regarding firearm and tool marks examination Ex.PM 
closed the prosecution evidence. 
7. 
 
The appellant was also examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C., 
wherein he did not opt to appear as his own witness in terms of Section 
340(2) Cr.P.C. In response to a particular question about why this case was 
against him and why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant made the 
following deposition: - 
“I have been falsely implicated in this case as 
Mst. Shabana Kausar was offering me to contract 
marriage with her for which I refused and she 
nourished the grudge against me.  At the time of 
occurrence, I was present at a turner shop which 
was run by me as a partnership with one Umar 
and one Bilal also used to work there. I came to 
know 
about 
this 
occurrence 
from 
above 
mentioned Umar, my partner, that my father has 
been arrested by the police in this case at which I 
myself surrendered before the police in this case 
on the next day through the Councilor of my 
Mohallah at which my father was released and I 
was arrested. I am sole bread winner of my 
family. My father is an old man.”  
 
8. 
 
After evaluating the evidence available on record in light of 
arguments advanced by both sides, the learned trial court found the 
prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which 
resulted in the appellant’s conviction in the terms above.   

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019

9. 
 
We have given our anxious and most thoughtful consideration 
to both sides’ rival submissions. We have minutely gone through the 
evidence on record. 
10. 
 
The incident took place on 08.11.2018 at 03:00 p.m. in the 
house of Shabana Kausar (the deceased), situated in street No.10, Mohallah 
Jameel Pak, within the area of Police Station, Jhang Bazar, District 
Faisalabad, which is at a distance of 4.5-kilometers from the place of 
occurrence. Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant reported the incident 
through written complaint (Exh.PD) to Idrees Iqbal, S.I. (PW-10) at 04:35 
p.m., who reached the place of occurrence on receiving information and he 
(PW-10) incorporated police proceedings (Ex.PD/2) at the bottom of the 
written complaint (Exh.PD) and referred the written application (Ex.PD) 
through Umar Farooq 275/C (not cited as PW) to the police station, based on 
which, formal F.I.R. (Exh. PD/1) was chalked out on the same day at 05:00 
p.m. by Muhammad Naveed Aslam 4232/H.C (PW-2). Shahid Ali (PW-6)-
the complainant took one hour and 35 minutes to report the incident to the 
police. The evidential value of the First Information Report will be reduced 
if it is made after the unexplained delay, particularly when it creates a 
suspicion that the informant had sufficient opportunity to concoct a story and 
falsely implicate the accused. Therefore, an adequate explanation for the 
delay would depend on various circumstances. In the present case, the 
prosecution has not given a reason for the delay in lodging the First 
Information Report (Exh.PD/1). It can be found from the First Information 
Report (Exh. PD/1) that it was not mentioned therein that Shahid Ali (PW-
6)-the complainant went to the police station to report the incident, nor was 
it mentioned that on hearing about the incident, police reached the spot and 
he (PW-6) reported the incident to the police. The complainant (PW-6) does 
not explain the reason for not lodging the report with the Police of the 
incident of murder of his sister, which took place in the house of his sister in 
his presence. The operative part of the written application (Ex.PD) reads as 
under: -

Shahid Ali, the complainant (PW-6), has not stated a single word in 
examination-in-chief about where he (PW-6) reported the incident to the 
police. Whereas, Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the investigating officer deposed 
during examination-in-chief that: - 
“On 8.11.2018, after receiving information of 
the instant occurrence, I reached at Mohallah 
Jamil Park, Street No.10 where Shahid Ali 
complainant, 
produced 
complaint 
Ex.PD 
whereupon I wrote my police proceedings 
Ex.PD/2 and sent the same to police station for 
the registration of formal FIR through Umar 
Farooq No.275-C at about 4:35 P.M.” 
Contrary to the above deposition of Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the 
investigating officer, Shahid Ali, the complainant (PW-6), deposed during 
cross-examination that: - 
“I presented the complaint Ex. PD in police 
station Jhang Bazar to SHO of the police 
station.” 
The statement made by Shahid Ali (PW-6), the complainant, casts severe 
doubt about where he reported the incident to the police. Besides, Idrees 
Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that a written complaint (Exh. PD) was given at the spot by 
Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, which reads as under: - 

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019 
 
7
“When I received information about the 
occurrence, I am not sure whether I was in the 
police station or in the area. I received the 
information through telephone call perhaps 
made by SHO P.S. Jhang Bazar. I reached at 
the place of occurrence at about 4:10 P.M. ------
------- Complaint Ex.PD was presented to me by 
the complainant at the place of occurrence 
which was got written by the complainant 
through someone else.” 
The deposition of Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the investigating officer 
revealed that on receiving information about the murder, he reached the 
place of occurrence at 04:10 p.m. Even then, Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the 
complainant, took 25 minutes to report the incident. What we find from the 
evidence is that Shahid Ali, the complainant (PW-6), has reported the 
incident of murder of Shabana Kausar, which occurred in the house of his 
sister in his and eyewitnesses’ presence at 04:35 p.m. on 08.11.2018 with the 
delay of one hour and 35 minutes, which creates doubt about the presence of 
Shahid Ali, the complainant (PW-6) and eyewitnesses. Delay in lodging the 
first information report often results in consultation and deliberation, which 
is a creature of an afterthought. Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, 
admitted that he is a resident of Chak No.60/J.B. and on 08.11.2018 at about 
03:00 p.m., he (PW-6)-the complainant, along with Muhammad Ashraf 
(PW-7) and Shahid Imran (PW-8) went to see his sister Shabana Kausar (the 
deceased). Per the prosecution case, Shabana Kausar (the deceased) resides 
at Street No.10, Mohallah Jamil Park, District Faisalabad. Per the 
prosecution’s case, the distance between Chak No.60/J.B and Street No.10 
Mohallah Jamil Park is 30 minutes on a motorbike. Shahid Ali (PW-6) 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“The distance between Shehbaz Pur and place 
of occurrence is of 30 minutes on motorbike” 
Whereas, Shahid Imran (PW-8)-the eye witness deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“It took 30 minutes to us to reach at the place of 
occurrence from Mohallah Shehbaz Pur on the 
day of occurrence.”

The evidence of a chance witness requires careful and close 
scrutiny, and a chance witness must adequately explain his presence at the 
place of occurrence. The witnesses, i.e., Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7), are chance witnesses. The evidence of chance 
witnesses can be accepted. The statements of such witnesses adequately 
explain the presence of witnesses, and such evidence stands the test of 
caution and scrutiny. It can only be relied upon if the proof has a ring of 
truth and is cogent, credible, and trustworthy. Similarly, the conduct of the 
chance witnesses is also a relevant factor while appreciating his 
evidence.
The occasion for the presence at the time of occurrence, the 
opportunity to witness the crime, the normal conduct of the witness to the 
victim, and his predisposition towards the accused, are some of the 
circumstances to be kept in view to weigh and accept the ocular evidence of 
chance witnesses. It is not the quantum of the evidence but the quality and 
credibility of the witnesses that lends assurance to the court for acceptance. 
The prosecution witnesses, i.e., Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, and 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7), have not stated the reason for their visit to the 
house of the deceased along with one outsider, i.e., Shahid Imran (PW-8). 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7) stated they had gone to see Shabana Kausar (the 
deceased) as she was his daughter. Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7) deposed 
during cross-examination that: - 
“We had gone to see the deceased as she was my 
daughter. We all three had come on one 
motorcycle driven by Shahid Imran who runs a 
motorcycle workshop.” 
 
 
The conduct of the witnesses, i.e., Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the 
complainant, Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7), and Shahid Imran (PW-8), is also 
relevant. It is to be seen that Shahid Imran (PW-8) has been acting as a 
pocket witness for the deceased’s family. As per prosecution witnesses, the 
incident took place in their presence. They were thus chance witnesses as by 
coincidence or chance they were present at the place of occurrence when the 
incident took place; they could not usually be there when they profess to 
have been. But the prosecution failed to establish that the chance witnesses 
informed the police about the incident, upon which Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019 
 
9
10)-the investigating officer, reached the spot. There are contradictions 
between the statements of the prosecution witnesses who informed the 
police about the incident. Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant deposed 
during cross-examination that: - 
“I myself did not make call to rescue 15. 
Volunteered that on hearing our hue and cry 
any person from the vicinity made the call at 
Rescue 15.” 
 
 
Contrary to the deposition of Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the 
complainant, Shahid Imran (PW-8)-the eye witness deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“Call at rescue 15 was made by Shahid Ali 
complainant.” 
 
 
The statements of Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, Shahid 
Imran (PW-8)-the eye witness; and Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the 
investigating officer, create doubt about who informed the police about the 
incident. The accused was unknown to Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7) and 
Shahid Imran (PW-8). Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7), the father of the 
deceased, deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Accused Nasir was not previously known to 
me. -------------- The name of the accused was 
told to me by the people who were attracted to 
the scene of occurrence.”  
 
 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7) has not stated that the name of the 
accused was disclosed to him by Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant. Shahid 
Imran (PW-8), deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Accused Nasir was not seen by me prior to the 
occurrence. The name of accused as Nasir was 
told to me by Shahid Ali complainant.”  
 
 
Based on the information given by Mohallah Dars and Shahid 
Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, both the witnesses, i.e., Muhammad Ashraf 
(PW-7) and Shahid Imran (PW-8) deposed the name of accused Muhammad 
Nasir alias Bhola (the appellant) as the murderer. The accused was unknown 
to the PWs, i.e., Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7) and Shahid Imran (PW-8). 

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019 
 
10
Looking at these facts, we are of the opinion that the prosecution has 
withheld the genuineness of the occurrence. Besides, Dr. Sadia Farooq (PW-
1), during the external examination of the body of Shabana Kausar (the 
deceased), specifically mentioned that “mouth opened, eyes closed.” If the 
prosecution witnesses, i.e., Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, Muhammad 
Ashraf (PW-7), and Shahid Imran (PW-8) attended to the deceased soon 
after the occurrence, there was no reason for the mouth to be open. At this 
juncture, it is relevant to mention the chemical changes that would occur 
when the dead body of a human being is exposed to different environmental 
situations. Autolysis (self-destruction) is an intrinsic activity brought about 
by the breakdown of cells and tissues of the human body because of the 
constituents of the said cells. The cell membranes break down after death 
and release enzymes that start self-digestion. After 30 minutes of death, the 
body starts to get stiff, and after that, if the mouth of the dead body remains 
open, it’s difficult to secure it back. The deceased person’s mouth remains 
open at the time of death; any relative or person nearby can close the mouth 
soon after, as the decomposition process begins after 10 to 30 minutes. It 
suggests that if Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, and Muhammad Ashraf 
(PW-7) were present at the place of occurrence and tried to close the mouth 
of the deceased, then there was no reason the same should not be closed. 
Besides, the family members had not accompanied the dead body of the 
deceased to the mortuary. Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, the brother of 
the deceased, deposed during his court statement that Shabana Kausar was 
married 18/20 years ago and had four daughters and one son, whereas her 
husband died two years ago. During cross-examination Shahid Ali (PW-6)-
the complainant, deposed that the son of the deceased was working in a 
workshop, whereas her daughters had gone to attend tuition. The son (name 
not mentioned) of Shabana Kausar could accompany the dead body of 
Shabana Kausar. But he did not go with the dead body rather, Muhammad 
Azeem (PW-9) and Mujahid Ali (given up PW) went with the dead body of 
Shabana Kausar (the deceased) to identify her dead body. It is strange that at 
the time and the place of occurrence, Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, 
and Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7), the brother and father of the deceased, were 

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019 
 
11
present. Still, none of them has accompanied the dead body of Shabana 
Kausar (the deceased). Muhammad Azeem (PW-9) has not stated his 
relationship with the deceased Shabana Kausar. Thus, the prosecution 
witnesses, i.e., Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, Muhammad Ashraf 
(PW-7), and Shahid Imran (PW-8), failed to prove their presence on the 
spot. Such evidence can be created at any moment. Shahid Ali PW-6)-the 
complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“At the time of occurrence, my deceased sister 
was sitting at a cot whereas I was sitting on a 
chair. The police had taken into possession the 
said cot and the chair.” 
 
 
Whereas, Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the investigating officer 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“At the time of my inspection to the place of 
occurrence, the cot was not available there. 
Again said I don’t remember whether the cot 
was available alongwith the dead body or not. It 
is correct that I have shown the existence of cot 
in the site plan Ex.PK.-----------It was not 
necessary for me to secure into possession the 
cot at which the deceased was lying at the place 
of occurrence.” 
Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“On receiving fire shots Mst. Shabana Kausar 
fell on the ground.” 
 
 
However, Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the investigating officer, 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“The dead body was lying on the ground.” 
 
 
Column No.24 of the inquest report (Ex.PC) reveals that the 
dead body was not lying on the ground but was lying on the cot. With this 
background, the presence of the alleged eyewitnesses, i.e., Shahid Ali (PW-
6)-the complainant, Muhammad Ashraf (PW-7), and Shahid Imran (PW-8) 
at the time and place of the incident, seems to be doubtful.   

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019 
 
12
11. 
 
There is yet another serious infirmity that further deepens the 
suspicion and casts a cloud on the credibility of the complainant (PW-6) and 
the prosecution story. Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the investigating officer 
deposed during examination-in-chief that after referring the written 
complaint (Ex.PD) to the police station through Umar Farooq 275/C at 04:35 
p.m., he (PW-10) inspected the dead body of the deceased Shabana Kausar 
and prepared injury statement (Ex. PB), inquest report (Ex. PC) and handed 
over the dead body of Shabana Kausar (the deceased) along with relevant 
documents to Asif Ali 6000/C (PW-4). In column No.3 of the inquest report 
(Ex. PC), the date and time of receiving death information were mentioned 
as “8.11.2018 at 04:00 p.m.” The unexplained discrepancies in the timings 
and reference of FIR in the column of brief history in the inquest report 
(Exh.PC) must be considered. As per the prosecution case, inquest 
proceedings were conducted at 04:00 p.m. on 8.11.2018, in the column 
relating to the brief history of the case of inquest report (Ex. PC) particulars 
of the FIR (Ex.PD/1) were mentioned, and the same reads as under: -

It is also relevant to mention here that on the face of the inquest report 
(Ex.PC) and in the column of a brief history of the case, there is overwriting 
on the number of FIR. The bare reading of the number of FIR reveals that 
the FIR number was written as 875/18, which was overwritten as 876/18, 
which is as under:- 

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019 
 
13
The same fact also reflects in the injury statement (Ex.PB), which casts 
doubt about the time of reporting the incident as well as the registration of 
FIR. The overwriting on the number of FIR in injury statement (Ex.PB) and 
in the inquest report (Ex.PC) reads as under: - 
 
 
The facts indicated that the prosecution story was still in the 
embryo and had not been given any shape. The FIR was recorded later after 
due deliberations and consultations and then ante-timed to give it the color 
of a promptly lodged FIR. The second external check that is equally 
important is sending a copy of the FIR along with the dead body for 
postmortem examination and its reference in the inquest report. Dr. Sadia 
Farooq (PW-1) deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“I also endorsed the injury statement Ex.PB 
and inquest report Ex.PC.” 
 
 
The doctor handed over the dead body of Shabana Kausar (the 
deceased) and relevant documents to Asif Ali 6000/C (PW-4). Asif Ali 
6000/C (PW-4), deposed during cross-examination-in-chief that: - 
“Dead body was delivered to me on 8.11.2018 at 
about 5:10 P.M”

& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019

Whereas, during the examination in chief, he (PW-4) deposed 
that the dead body was placed in the mortuary of Allied Hospital Faisalabad 
at 06:20 P.M. Per the prosecution case, a written complaint (Exh. PD) was 
handed over to Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the investigating officer, at 04:35 
p.m. If it was so, it was required to be explained by Idrees Iqbal, S.I. (PW-
10)-investigating officer, by plausible evidence on the record as to how the 
inquest was undertaken at 04:00 p.m. and after the preparation of the inquest 
report (Ex.PC), injury statement (Ex.PB), Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the 
investigating officer entrusted the dead body of Shabana Kausar (the 
deceased) to Asif Ali 6000/C (PW-4) for taking to the mortuary for 
postmortem examination. In the instant case, formal FIR (Ex.PD/1) was 
chalked out at 05:00 p.m., whereas reference to the same was given in the 
column of a brief history of inquest report (Ex. PC). There is overwriting on 
the number of the FIR in the injury statement (Ex.PB) and inquest report 
(Ex.PC). It also gets support from the testimony of Dr. Sadia Farooq (PW-
1), who conducted post-mortem on 09-11-2018 at 8:15 a.m. upon the dead 
body of Shabana Kausar (the deceased). As per the prosecution case, FIR 
(Ex.PD/1) was registered at 05:00 p.m., and the dead body was placed in the 
mortuary of Allied Hospital, Faisalabad, at 06:20 p.m. along with 
documents, but Dr. Sadia Farooq (PW-1) deposed during examination-in-
chief that:- 
“According to police papers, death occurred on 
8.11.2018 at 4:00 P.M. I received police 
documents on the same day at 8:00 P.M. I 
conducted autopsy on 9.11.2018 at 8:15 A.M.” 
 
 
She reaffirmed during cross-examination that she received the 
dead body on 08.11.2018 at 6:20 p.m. and received complete police papers 
on 08.11.2018 at 08:00 p.m. This also created doubt about the time of 
registration of FIR. Learned counsel for the complainant submitted that due 
to the non-availability of a lady doctor, a postmortem could not be 
conducted soon after receiving the dead body and the documents from the 
police. The deposition of Dr. Sadia Farooq (PW-1) negates the plea of 
learned counsel for the complainant, when she (PW-1) stated that she 
received the dead body of the deceased at 06:20 p.m. and complete 

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019 
 
15
documents at 08:15 p.m. on 08.11.2018. Dr. Sadia Farooq (PW-1) admitted 
her presence and availability on the evening of 08.11.2018. But the 
prosecution did not explain the delay in conducting the postmortem 
examination. Dr. Sadia Farooq (PW-1) conducted Autopsy on the dead body 
of Shabana Kausar at 08:15 a.m. on 09.11.2018, with a delay of about 15 
hours and fifteen minutes from the time of registration of FIR. The fact, 
however, remains that the post-mortem examination was delayed for fifteen 
hours and fifteen minutes. The prosecution did not explain the delay in 
conducting the postmortem examination. Dr. Sadia Farooq (PW-1) has 
deposed explicitly during examination in chief that: - 
“Since body was placed in refrigerator, so I 
cannot comment on time elapsed since death. 
 
 
The facts above themselves are sufficient to create serious 
doubt about the prosecution story that till the postmortem examination, the 
FIR (Exh.PD/1) was not in existence until the postmortem examination. So, 
no reliance can be placed on such testimony to establish the appellant’s guilt, 
which would form the basis for conviction. 
12. 
 
The Investigating Officer has conducted the investigation of the 
case in a faulty manner. Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the investigating officer 
has not mentioned the distance between different points in the un-scaled site 
plan (Ex.PK) prepared on 08.11.2018. Whereas, the distance between 
different points has been mentioned in the scaled site plans (Ex.PE and 
Ex.PE/1) prepared by Asif Jahan draftsman (PW-3) on 10.11.2018. The 
scaled site plans (Ex.PE and Ex.PE/1) were prepared to bring the 
prosecution version in line with the postmortem examination report 
(Exh.PA). As per the postmortem report (Ex.PA), there was burning, 
blackening, and tattooing on the injuries. Admittedly, an autopsy was 
conducted on 09.11.2018, and the draftsman visited the place of occurrence 
on 10.11.2018, and after that, he prepared site plans. So, mentioning distance 
by the draftsman in scaled site plans becomes immaterial. The investigating 
officer's conduct and investigation are not above board.

13. 
 
As far as motive is concerned, it is a double-edged sword that 
cuts both sides/ways. In the instant case, the prosecution, to establish the 
motive part of the incident, produced Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, 
who deposed in his examination in chief that: - 
“Motive behind the occurrence was that after 
the death of the husband of my sister two years 
prior to the occurrence, accused used to pursue 
my sister rather forced her to enter into 
marriage with him.” 
During cross-examination, Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, deposed 
that:- 
“My deceased sister had told me that accused 
Nasir used to tease her which was conveyed to 
the father of the accused and his inmates by 
me.-------I did not make any complaint to the 
police station in respect of teasing of the 
accused to my sister.” 
Shahid Imran (PW-8)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“Shahid Ali complainant had told to me that 
accused Nasir used to come to the house of 
deceased and also used to tease her.” 
 
 
In his statement under section 342 of Cr.P.C., the appellant 
stated that the deceased made an offer to him for Nikah, so he was involved 
in the instant case. The well-known enmity is a double edged weapon that 
cuts both ways. If, on the one hand, it provided a motive for the accused to 
commit the occurrence in question, on the other hand, it equally provided to 
the first informant to implicate his rival. Based on the motive to commit the 
crime, the accused cannot lead a judgment of conviction. Prove of motive by 
itself may not be a ground to hold the accused guilty.  
14. 
 
So far as recovery of the weapon of offence, i.e., pistol 30-bore 
(P-4) from the possession of the accused/appellant and positive report of 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency (Ex. PM), are concerned, as per the 
prosecution case, on 16.11.2018, the accused was arrested. On 19.11.2018, 
upon his disclosure, pistol 30-bore (P-4) was recovered from his residence. 

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019 
 
17
Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the investigating officer secured the same through 
a recovery memo (Ex.PJ). Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the investigating officer 
deposed during examination-in-chief that on 19.11.2018, he handed a sealed 
parcel of the recovered pistol to Moharrar Tauqeer for keeping it in safe 
custody in the makhana. Contrary to the deposition of Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-
10)-the investigating officer, Touqeer Ahmad 5691/H.C. (PW-5), deposed 
during examination-in-chief that Idrees Iqbal S.I. (PW-10)-the investigating 
officer sent the sealed parcel said to contain pistol 30 bore for safe custody, 
but Touqeer Ahmad 5691/H.C. (PW-5) did not name the person who handed 
over said sealed parcel to him. Besides, Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, 
deposed during cross-examination that: 
“Accused was arrested by the police on the day 
of occurrence.” 
 
 
The statement of Shahid Ali (PW-6)-the complainant, throws 
clouds of doubt on the recovery of the pistol 30-bore (P-4). It creates doubt 
about the recovery of the pistol 30-bore (P-4). In these circumstances, the 
recovery of the weapon of offence and a positive report is not of any 
consequence. 
15. 
 
As it is difficult to rely upon the testimonies of PWs 6, 7, and 8 
and for other reasons enumerated hereinbefore, we are persuaded to hold 
that the prosecution had not been able to prove its case against the appellant 
beyond any shadow of a doubt as there were many dents in the prosecution 
story.  The conviction and sentence that learned trial court recorded could 
not be sustained. It is held in the case of “Muhammad Akram v. The 
State” (2009 SCMR 230) that: - 
“It is an axiomatic principle of law that in case 
of doubt, the benefit thereof must accrue in 
favour of the accused as matter of right and not 
of grace. It was observed by this Court in the 
case of “Tariq Pervez v. The State” (1995 
SCMR 1345) that for giving the benefit of 
doubt, it was not necessary that there should be 
many circumstances creating doubts. If there is 
circumstance which created reasonable doubt 
in a prudent mind about the guilt of the 

Murder Reference No.104 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019 
 
18
accused, then the accused would be entitled to 
the benefit of doubt not as a matter of grace and 
concession but as a matter of right.” 
16. 
 
The upshot of the above discussion is that the prosecution had 
severely failed to bring home a charge against the appellant beyond any 
reasonable doubt; therefore, in the interest of the safe administration of 
Criminal Justice, Crl. Appeal No.44570 of 2019, filed by Muhammad Nasir 
alias Bhola, the appellant, is accepted in toto. The sentence awarded by the 
learned Sessions Judge, Faisalabad, vide judgment dated 17.04.2019, is set 
aside. The appellant is acquitted of the charge in case FIR No.876/2018 
dated 08.11.2018, registered under section 302 PPC, at P.S. Jhang Bazar, 
District Faisalabad. The appellant-Muhammad Nasir @ Bhola, son of 
Rasheed Ahmad, is ordered to be released forthwith, if not required in any 
other case.  
17. 
 
Murder Reference No.104 of 2019, forwarded by the learned 
trial court for confirmation of the sentence of death inflicted upon the 
convict fails, which is answered in Negative.
