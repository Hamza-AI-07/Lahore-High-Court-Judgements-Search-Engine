------------------------ 
 
 
AALIA NEELUM, J:- The appellant-Bilal Hassan, son of 
Ghulam Murtaza, caste Jatt, resident of village Chak Bhulla, Tehsil & 
District, Gujrat, was involved in case F.I.R. No.86 of 2016, dated 
22.02.2016, offences under Sections 302, 324 P.P.C., registered at P.S. 
Saddar, District Gujrat and was tried by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, 
District Gujrat. The learned trial court seized with the matter in terms of the 
judgment dated 25.03.2019, convicted Bilal Hassan (the appellant) under 
Section 302(b) PPC, and sentenced to Death for committing Qatl-e-Amd of 
Azmat Ullah (the deceased), with the direction to pay compensation of 
Rs.5,00,000/- to the legal heirs of the deceased as envisaged under section 
544-A of Cr.P.C and in case of default thereof, to further undergo 06-months 
S.I. The appellant was also convicted under section 324 PPC and sentenced 
to undergo ten years R.I., with the direction to pay a fine of Rs.15,000/-. The 
benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C was also extended in favor of the appellant. 
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial court, 
Bilal Hassan, the appellant has assailed his conviction by filing the instant 

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019 
 
2
appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No.19109 of 2019. Whereas the learned 
trial court also referred M.R. No.81 of 2019 (The State. Vs. Bilal Hassan) 
for confirmation of the death sentence awarded to the appellant-Bilal 
Hassan. The matters arising out of the same judgment of the learned trial 
court are being disposed of through a single judgment.       
3. 
 
The prosecution story, as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex. PB) lodged 
on the written application (Ex. PC) of Haji Zia Ullah-the complainant (died 
during trial), is that in the intervening night of 22.02.2016 at about 03:30 
A.M, Bilal Hassan (the appellant), who is their close relative, came to the 
house of Azmat Ullah (deceased) through the roof and knocked internal 
door; the brother of the complainant and his daughter-in-law, namely, Shazia 
wife of Sami Ullah (PW-7) asked about the matter from the accused, who 
stated to open the door as he had an urgent piece of work. The moment the 
door was opened, Bilal (the appellant), wearing „Chadar,‟ took out riffle 244 
bore, made a fire-shot, and asked about her father-in-law, Azmat Ullah, and 
started firing, due to which family members woke up. They informed the 
complainant telephonically, who was present at his Dera. The complainant 
reached the place of occurrence. Before the complainant‟s arrival, accused-
Bilal Hassan (the appellant) made a fire-shot on the chest of Azmat Ullah-
brother of the complainant, which went through and through, who smeared 
with blood and died at the spot. Shazia Begum tried to rescue her father-in-
law, and the accused/appellant fired upon her, hitting her right flank. The 
accused, Bilal Hassan (the appellant), kept firing while standing in the 
compound, and he also extended threats of dire consequences and told that 
he would teach a lesson of taking Haveli. The occurrence was witnessed by 
Sami Ullah (PW-7) and Nasrullah (PW-8). The motive behind the 
occurrence was that the complainant‟s sister gave her personal Haveli to 
Azmat Ullah, deceased, which raised a grudge in the mind of the accused, 
due to which he committed the said occurrence.   
4. 
 
After the occurrence, the complainant reported the matter to the 
police through the written application (Ex. PC); after that, formal F.I.R (Ex. 
PB) was chalked out by Nisar Ahmad 829/GT (PW-3). After registration of 

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019

this case, the investigation of this case was conducted by Khadim Hussain 
S.I (died during trial), who, having found the accused/appellant guilty, 
prepared a report under Section 173, Cr.P.C., and sent the same to the court 
of competent jurisdiction. On 25.03.2017, the learned trial court formally 
charged the appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In 
support of its version, the prosecution produced as many as eight (08) 
witnesses.  
5. 
 
Ocular account, in this case, has come out from the statements 
of Sami Ullah (PW-7) and Nasrullah (PW-8), whereas Dr. Nayyer Akram, 
Medical Officer (PW-4), who conducted a postmortem examination on the 
dead body of the deceased-Azmat Ullah, found the following injuries on his 
person: - 
INJURIES 
1-A) 
A firearm injury entry wound of 1x1 cm 
with inverted margins at the lower 
anterior part of the chest.  
1-B) 
A firearm injury exit wound of 2x2 cm 
with averted margins at the lower part 
of the back on the paravertebral region.  
OPINION 
 
After conducting the postmortem examination, the 
doctor opined that the injuries were ante mortem and caused by 
a firearm causing damage to vital organs, i.e., liver aorta and 
stomach, leading to hypovolemic shock due to excessive 
bleeding leading to death. The time between injury and death 
was within minutes, and the time between death and post-
mortem was about 11 hours and 45 minutes.       
The statements of the remaining prosecution witnesses are formal in nature.  
6. 
 
The learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up PWs Dr. 
Mubashara and Ehsan Ullah as unnecessary and after tendering Forensic 
D.N.A and Serology Analysis report (Ex. PP, Ex. PQ) and attested copies of 

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019 
 
4
treatment chart and Surgical Notes of injured Shazia Bibi (deceased) 
(Ex.PR/1-46) closed the prosecution evidence. 
7. 
 
The appellant was also examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C., 
wherein he did not opt to appear as his own witness in terms of section 
340(2) Cr.P.C.; however, he tendered documents as Mark-DA to Mark-DD 
in his defence evidence. In response to a particular question about why this 
case was against him and why the PWs deposed against him, the appellant 
made the following deposition: - 
“Prior to the occurrence my sister Fouzia was 
married with Waseem Ullah who was son of Azmat 
Ullah deceased and out the said wedlock, two children 
namely Haider and Abdullah were born and after 
that Waseem Ullah was died. Later on Fouzia was 
remarried with Aman Ullah brother of Azmat Ullah 
deceased and out of this wedlock four minors namely 
Umer, Momna, Haleema and Ibrahim were born, but, 
later on, Aman Ullah was also died. After the death of 
both husbands, Fouzia and her children came to the 
house of her parents. During the days of occurrence, 
the minors and Fouzia were being looked after by me 
and my father. I used to demand the share of the 
children and Fouzia from the land from Sami Ullah, 
Nasar Ullah and Haji Zia Ullah etc., but they were 
reluctant to give the due shares of Fouzia and her 
children and had turned hostile towards me. All the 
PWs had also suspicion about the character of Azmat 
Ullah and Shazia. They themselves managed to 
murder Azmat Ullah and Shazia, but luckily Shazia 
was survived and Azmat Ullah met his death. 
Complainant party tried to kill two birds with one 
stone at one hand they entangled me in false case and 
on the other hand they also achieved their goal. All 
the PWs being interse related had falsely deposed 
against me to usurp the land of the minors and 
Fouzia, so, that no one could pursue to achieve their 
land from the complainant party. I am innocent.” 
 
8. 
After evaluating the evidence available on record in light of 
arguments advanced by both sides, the learned trial court found the 
prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which 
resulted in the appellant‟s conviction in the terms above.   

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019

9. 
 
We have given our anxious and most thoughtful consideration 
to both sides‟ rival submissions. We have minutely gone through the 
evidence on record.  
10. 
 
In the instant case, the occurrence occurred at 03:30 a.m. 
(night) on 22.02.2016 in the area of Chak Bhola, situated within the 
jurisdiction of Police Station Saddar, District Gujrat. The inter-se distance 
between the place of occurrence and the police station is about 5/6 
kilometers. Whereas, formal FIR (Exh. PB) was got registered on 
22.02.2016 at 07:00 a.m., on the written application (Ex. PC) of Haji Zia 
Ullah-the complainant (died during trial), brother of the deceased Azmat 
Ullah. It is note-able that the occurrence occurred at 03:30 a.m. (night), and 
the distance between the place of occurrence and the police station was 5/6 
kilometers. Whereas, Haji Zia Ullah-the complainant, took three hours and 
thirty minutes to report the incident to the police at the police station. Sami 
Ullah (PW-7)-the eye witness, son of Azmat Ullah-the deceased and 
husband of Shazia Bibi-injured, deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I did not go to Police Station to report the 
occurrence. Volunteered stated that I went to hospital 
for saving the victims. ------------Police reached the 
place of occurrence upon receiving „15‟ call at about 
4:00/5:00 AM. None of the said police official, is 
mentioned as witness in the calendar of witnesses. We 
reached to hospital at about 4:00/4:30 AM. Police 
station Sadar Gujrat was situated at the distance of 
about 5/6 KMs away from the place of occurrence.” 
He (PW-7)-the eye witness, further deposed during cross-examination:  
“Police was reported about the occurrence at about 
6:00/7:00 AM. I was in hospital, I did not know, when 
my paternal uncle Zia Ullah reported the occurrence 
to the police.”  
Nasrullah (PW-8)-the eye witness, the brother of Azmat Ullah-the deceased, 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Zia Ullah received information about the occurrence 
through his wife. When Zia Ullah reached the place of 
occurrence, the accused had left the scene of 

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019 
 
6
occurrence. I with other eye witness of the occurrence 
did not become complainant of the instant case. I did 
not go to the Police Station after the occurrence. I 
went to Police Station in connection with instant case 
for once. -------------Zia Ullah complainant came to 
hospital after about one hour of our reaching in 
hospital. Khadim Hussain SI came to hospital after 
about 1/1½ hour of our reaching to hospital.” 
Whereas, in an application for registration of case (Ex. PC) as well as in FIR 
(Ex. PB), Haji Zia Ullah-the complainant mentioned as under: - 
"ووقہع ذہا عیمس اہلل ودل تمظع اہلل
، رصناہلل ودل   مال  سلو اوقا  ٹج انکسےئ دہہی ےن مشچب وخد داھکی

یہ اج ں قح وہ ایگ ےہ یری  اعدت ا ےہ ہ دسوخا ت شی رکات وہں راسوا ی نانو ی ی اجوے" 
From the above narration of written application (Ex.PC) as well as FIR 
(Ex.PB), it reveals that after the incident, Haji Zia Ullah-the complainant 
(died during the trial), went to the police station to report the incident to the 
police, after making a call on “15”. The police reached the place of 
occurrence and shifted Shazia Bibi-injured to hospital, whereas Azmat Ullah 
died at the spot. Whereas, Sami Ullah (PW-7)-the eye witness deposed 
during the examination in chief that: - 
“We made call to the police on „15‟ upon which police 
came there, I shifted my wife in injured condition to 
ABS Hospital, Gujrat in the accompany of police 
„15‟.” 
Similarly, he (PW-7) deposed during cross-examination:  
“The dead body of my deceased father was taken to 
hospital at about 08:00 AM. I had taken my wife to 
hospital, so I cannot say that one Sadaqat Ali 1540/C 
took the dead body of my father to hospital at 05:00 
AM.”  
During cross-examination, the defence got confronted about the 
improvements made by Sami Ullah (PW-7)-the eye witness. Sami Ullah 
(PW-7) deposed during cross-examination that:- 

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019 
 
7
“I did not record to the police u/s 161 Cr.P.C. about 
the making of call to police on „15‟ or her shifting by 
me to ABS Hospital, Gujrat in injured condition.” 
Contrary to the above, Nasrullah (PW-8)-the eye witness deposed during the 
examination in chief that:  
“Local Police was informed about the occurrence, 
who came at the spot and dead body of Azmat Ullah 
and Shazia Bibi in injured condition were shifted to 
ABS Hospital, Gujrat.” 
 
Whereas, during cross-examination, Nasrullah (PW-8)-the eye witness, 
deposed that:- 
“Police who attended „15‟ call reached the place of 
occurrence at about 4:00 AM. Said police took Shazia 
injured and Azmat Ullah deceased on their vehicle to 
hospital.” He (PW-8) further deposed during cross 
examination that, “When dead body was taken to 
hospital by police, I accompanied them. The dead 
body of Azmat Ullah was shifted to the mortuary at 
4:00 AM. I remained in hospital for about 2/3 hours. 
When Zia Ullah complainant came to the place of 
occurrence, Azmat Ullah deceased and Shazia injured 
had been shifted to hospital.”  
 
 
 
In the prosecution evidence, there is a severe flaw, to precisely 
fix the time when the incident was reported to the police. This aspect of the 
matter is sufficient to cast doubt about the authenticity of the F.I.R. This 
creates serious doubt about the genuineness of the prosecution story, 
including the presence of the complainant at the scene of occurrence. Sohail 
Ramzan 1292/HC (PW-6) was produced by the prosecution in secondary 
evidence, as Khadim Hussain-investigating officer, died during the trial. He 
(PW-6) deposed during examination in chief that: - 
“Khadim Hussain SI reached at the place of 
occurrence (Village Bhulla) situated within territorial 
jurisdiction 
of 
police 
station 
Sadar 
Gujrat. 
Complainant Zia Ullah appeared before him and 
supported his earlier version given in Exh.P.C and 
further stated that the dead body of Azmat Ullah 
deceased has been already shifted to ABS Hospital, 

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019 
 
8
Gujrat where his brother Ehsan Ullah is present to 
guard the dead body.” He (PW-6) further deposed 
during cross-examination that, “Then I.O alongwith me 
proceeded to ABS Hospital, Gujrat alongwith other 
officials. When we reached there dead body was 
found lying outside the mortuary of ABS Hospital, 
Gujrat. I.O prepared injury statement Exh. P.E, 
inquest report Exh. P.F. also prepared the application 
for post mortem examination on the dead body of 
deceased Exh.P.D.” 
 
 
Whereas, on perusal of the inquest report (Exh. PF), it reveals 
that the same was prepared at village Chak Bhulla and in column No.3, i.e., 
time and date of receiving information of death, (----- تقریبا 22-02-16) was 
written and time was not mentioned. In the column related to the brief 
history of the case, it was said that: -

On the last page of the inquest report (Exh.PF), in the column 
related to where it was prepared, it was mentioned as “Chak Bholla on 
22.02.2016,” and both the witnesses did not sign the same. Similarly, 
column No. 24 of the inquest report (Exh. P.F) reveals that the dead body 
was not lying on the cot. The application for postmortem examination 
(Exh.PD) reveals that the duty medical office received the application at 
3:00 p.m. on 22.02.2016. Dr. Nayyar Akram (PW-4), who conducted a post-
mortem examination on the dead body of Azmat Ullah (the deceased), 
deposed that he conducted an autopsy at 3:15 PM on the corpus of Azmat 
Ullah (the deceased). During cross-examination, he (PW-4) deposed that:- 
“The police papers were provided to me at 3:05 PM. 
It is correct that had the police papers been provided 
to me earlier; I would have conducted post mortem 
earlier.” 

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019

We have noted that in the inquest report (Exh.PF), the 
investigating officer did not mention the time of receiving information of 
death in column No.4. Whereas, from the application for conducting a 
postmortem examination (Exh. PD), it reveals that Medical Officer received 
the said application at 03:00 p.m. So, it becomes that no FIR had been 
registered as alleged by the prosecution, and after some consultation and 
deliberation, it came into existence. It is established that the FIR has been 
got registered by Haji Zia Ullah-the complainant, who was not an 
eyewitness of the occurrence. The contents of the inquest report (Ex.PF) 
reveal that the same was prepared after conducting a preliminary 
investigation by the police. The inordinate delay of three hours and thirty 
minutes from the time of the commission of the offence remained 
unexplained and rendered the whole of the prosecution version doubtful. As 
per the prosecution case, Sami Ullah (PW-7)-the eye witness, shifted his 
wife, Shazia Bibi-injured to the hospital for medical treatment to save her 
life. Nasrullah (PW-8), the eye witness, stated that he went with the dead 
body to the hospital and remained there. Whereas, as per the prosecution 
version, Zia Ullah went to the police station to report the incident. The 
contents of FIR (Ex.PB) and application for case registration (Ex.PC) reveal 
that Zia Ullah-the complainant was present at the place of occurrence when 
the last episode of the incident was under progress. As mentioned above, 
Sami Ullah (PW-7) admitted during cross-examination that:  
“Police reached the place of occurrence upon 
receiving „15‟ call at about 4:00/5:00 AM.”  
But the incident was not reported to police at 4:00/5:00 a.m. when the local 
police reached the spot. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held in the 
case of Iftikhar Hussain and another v. The State (2004 SCMR 1185) 
that:- 
“As far as F.I.R. under section 154, Cr.P.C. itself is 
concerned, it is always treated to be a cornerstone of 
the prosecution case to establish guilt against culprits 
involved in the crime. Thus it has got a very 
significant role to play. If there is any doubt in 
lodging of F.I.R. and commencement of investigation, 

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019 
 
10
it gives rise to a doubt in benefit of which, of course, 
cannot be extended to anyone else except to the 
accused. However, an F.I.R. under section 154, 
Cr.P.C. which has been lodged after conducting an 
inquiry loses its evidentiary value--------.” 
 
 
Admittedly, the incident occurred inside the deceased‟s house 
at odd night hours. Sami Ullah (PW-7)-the eye witness, and Nasrullah (PW-
8)-the eye witness, failed to explain why Shalwar/trouser of Shazia Bibi-
injured, was not secured by the investigating officer during the investigation, 
or handed over by the medical officer. Non-handing over the Shalwar of 
Shazia Bibi-injured has much significance in the instant case. As per the 
prosecution case, Shazia Bibi-injured opened the door of the house on 
knocking the door by the accused-Bilal. Sami Ullah (PW-7)-the eye witness 
deposed during the examination in chief that: - 
“At 3:30 AM, on the same morning, somebody 
knocked the door of the room of my father. My wife 
woke up and asked that who is knocking. Bilal 
accused present in the court who is my second cousin 
replied that I am Bilal, upon which my wife opened 
the door.” 
 
 
It does not appeal to the prudent mind that a woman without 
Shalwar/trousers will come forward to do any work in our social setup. The 
prosecution‟s case mainly revolves around Shazia Bibi-injured, who opened 
the door. After that, the incident took place. Sami Ullah (PW-7)-the eye 
witness deposed during the examination in chief that: - 
“On 23.02.2016, I and Nasrullah joined the 
investigation before the I.O. In our presence Sadaqat 
Ali 1540/C brought last worn clothes of the injured 
Shazia Bibi my wife comprising of Qameez P-9, 
sweater P-10, and Brazier P-11, which were taken 
into possession by the police vide recovery memo Exh. 
P.L, which I and Nasrullah signed.” 
Whereas, during cross-examination, he (PW-7) deposed that:  
“The clothes of my injured wife were not handed over 
to the I.O. in my presence.”  

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019 
 
11
 
 
However, the investigating officer moved an application for 
permission to record the statement of Shazia Bibi-injured on 23.02.2016, 
which was allowed by the medical officer; even then, the statement of 
Shazia Bibi-injured was not recorded. During the trial, Shazia Bibi-injured 
expired. Sami Ullah (PW-7)-the eye witness deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“The grave of my deceased wife is situated at above 
said Fatehpur village. -----My wife went to her 
parents house, as there was no one to care her in my 
village. -------I did not get an autopsy of the dead body 
of my wife Shazia deceased.” 
 
 
Looking at these facts, this court is of the opinion that the 
prosecution has withheld the true genesis of the occurrence. 
11. 
 
We have also noted that Sami Ullah (PW-7)-the eye witness 
deposed that the appellant/accused-Bilal Hassan, made the first fire shot on 
the person of Azmat Ullah, his father, which hit on the front of his chest and 
he fell. After that, his wife, Shazia Bibi, to save Azmat Ullah, came forward, 
and Bilal Hassan made another fire shot, which hit his wife, and she became 
injured. Whereas, Nasrullah (PW-8)-the eye witness deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“Firstly, Shazia injured received fire shot and 
thereafter, Azmat Ullah deceased received fire shot in 
my presence. Accused made fire shots inside the room 
while standing just ahead of the door.” 
 
 
There is conflict between the statements of both witnesses 
regarding the fact that the first fire made by the appellant/Bilal Hassan, hit 
whom. In this background, the mode and manner of the incident as deposed 
by the witnesses seem doubtful.  
12. 
 
As per prosecution evidence after registration of the F.I.R., 
(Exh.PB) Sohail Ramzan 1292/HC (PW-6) along with the investigating 
officer went to the hospital at 10:00/10:30 a.m. Sohail Ramzan 1292/HC 
(PW-6) deposed during cross-examination: 

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019 
 
12
“I alongwith I.O went to hospital on the day of 
occurrence at about 10:00/10:30 AM.” 
 
 
Particularly in the circumstances that the incident was reported 
to the police at 07:00 a.m., whereas the incident occurred at 03:30 a.m and 
the distance between the place of occurrence and the police station is 5/6 
kilometers; the medical office received the application for postmortem (Ex. 
PD) at 03:00 p.m. Per the postmortem report (Ex. PG), the dead body was 
received in the mortuary at 05:00 a.m. on 22.02.2016, whereas the doctor 
received complete documents at 03:05 p.m. on 22.02.2016. There is a delay 
in the postmortem examination of about 11 hours and 45 minutes, which is 
supported by a doctor‟s statement. In this regard, Dr. Nayyer Akram (PW-4), 
Medical Officer, deposed during cross-examination:- 
“The police papers were provided to me at 3:05 PM. 
It is correct that had the police papers been provided 
to me earlier, I would have conducted postmortem 
earlier.”  
 
 
There is no plausible explanation as to why the postmortem of 
the dead body was delayed for 11 hours and 45 minutes. This aspect of the 
matter is sufficient to cast doubt about the authenticity of the F.I.R. This 
creates serious doubt about the genuineness of the prosecution story. Delay 
in lodging the FIR often results in embellishment, which is a creature of an 
afterthought. 
13. 
 
There is also conflict between the ocular account and medical 
evidence. Dr. Nayyer Akram (PW-4), Medical Officer, deposed during 
cross-examination that: 
 “It is correct that dimension of injury received by the 
deceased was upward to down word.”  
 
 
 
It reveals that from the upper level, a fire shot was made by the 
accused, which hit the deceased. Whereas, as per the prosecution witnesses, 
i.e., Sami Ullah (PW-7) and Nasrullah (PW-8), the accused/appellant made a 
straight fire, which hit on the front of the chest of Azmat Ullah-the deceased, 

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019 
 
13
and he received an injury in standing position. Sami Ullah (PW-7)-the eye 
witness deposed during the examination in chief that: 
 “My father Azmat Ullah also woke up and reached 
near the door and asked Bilal Hassan accused that 
you want to kill me. Bilal Hassan replied that I want 
to teach you a lesson for taking Haveli and started 
reckless firing. One fire made by him hit my father on 
front of his chest who fell down near the door of his 
room after receiving severe injury.”  
 
 
It reveals that the prosecution witnesses concealed the mode 
and manner of the occurrence.

So far as recovery of the weapon of offence, i.e., rifle 244-bore, 
from the possession of the accused/appellant and positive report of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, are concerned, as per the prosecution case, on 
03.03.2016, the accused was arrested from his Dera situated at Chak Bhola 
and upon his disclosure, rifle 244-bore (P-4) and three live bullets (P-5 to P-
7) were recovered. The investigating officer secured the same through a 
recovery memo (Ex. PI). Contrary to the prosecution case, Sami Ullah (PW-
7)-the eye witness, deposed during cross-examination that: 
 “The police arrested the accused by cordoning of 
village on the same day. The father of accused, 
handed over the accused to the police on the same.”  
He (PW-7) further deposed during cross-examination that: 
 “Volunteered stated that on the first day of 
occurrence, the father of the accused produced the 
accused before police and stated that he had no 
concern with the occurrence; his son, the present 
accused had committed the occurrence.”  
 
 
Besides, Sohail Ramzan 1292/H.C. (PW-6) stated that on 
22.02.2016, the investigating officer secured ten crime empties of 244-bore 
(P-8/1-10) through recovery memo (Ex. PK), which were handed over to the 
Moharrar Malkhana. Sohail Ramzan 1292/H.C. (PW-6) deposed during 
cross-examination that:

& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019 
 
14
 “As per record, during spot inspection, five crime 
empties were collected by I.O which were made into 
sealed parcel.”  
 
 
The Punjab Forensic Science Agency report (Ex. PQ) reveals 
that a parcel of 44-bore rifle was submitted on 04.03.2016, and a parcel of 
ten 44-caliber cartridges was submitted on 01.03.2016 by Khadim Hussain 
S.I. Given the admission of prosecution witnesses that on the day of 
occurrence, i.e., 22.02.2016, the accused/appellant was in police custody, 
and investigating officer collected five crime empties, creates doubt about 
the recovery of rifle 244-bore on 03.03.2016 and its positive report. In these 
circumstances, the recovery of the weapon of offence and a positive report 
are not of any consequence.  
15. 
 
As far as the motive is concerned, although the prosecution has 
alleged motive for committing the incident by the appellant, however, the 
prosecution in this regard produced no evidence. We are of the opinion that 
the prosecution has been unable to establish a motive in the instant case. 
16. 
 
All the above-narrated facts and circumstances lead this Court 
to only one conclusion: the prosecution has not been able to prove the case 
against the appellant, as there were many dents in the prosecution story, as 
such the conviction and sentence recorded by the learned trial court cannot 
be sustained. The conviction passed by the learned trial court in the 
circumstances is against all cannons of law recognized for dispensing 
criminal justice.  As per dictates of the law, the benefit of every doubt is to 
be extended in favor of the accused.  In the case of “Muhammad Akram  v. 
The State” (2009 SCMR 230), it has been held as under: - 
“The nutshell of the whole discussion is that the 
prosecution case is not free from doubt. It is an 
axiomatic principle of law that in case of doubt, the 
benefit thereof must accrue in favor of the accused as 
matter of right and not of grace. It was observed by 
this Court in the case of Tariq Pervez v. The State 
1995 SCMR 1345 that for giving the benefit of doubt, 
it was not necessary that there should be many 
circumstances 
creating 
doubts. 
If 
there 
is 
circumstance which created reasonable doubt in a 

Murder Reference No.81 of 2019 
& Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019 
 
15
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the 
accused would be entitled to the benefit of doubt not 
as a matter of grace and concession but as a matter of 
right.” 
 
 
The golden principle of law is that the Court should let off a 
hundred guilty but not convict one innocent person.  In the case of “Ayub 
Masih  v.  The State” (PLD 2002 SC 1048), it has been held by the Hon‟ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan that: - 
“----It is hardly necessary to reiterate that the 
prosecution is obliged to prove its case against the 
accused beyond any reasonable doubt and if it fails to 
do so the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt as of 
right. It is also firmly settled that if there is an element 
of doubt as to the guilt of the accused the benefit of that 
doubt must be extended to him. The doubt of course 
must be reasonable and not imaginary or artificial. The 
rule of benefit of doubt, which is described as the 
golden rule, is essentially a rule of prudence which can 
not be ignored while dispensing justice in accordance 
with law. It is based on the maxim, “it is better that ten 
guilty persons be acquitted rather than one innocent 
person be convicted”. 
 In simple words it means that utmost care should be 
taken by the Court in convicting an accused. It has 
further been held in “The State  v.  Mushtaq Ahmed” 
(PLD 1973 SC 418) that this rule is antithesis of 
haphazard approach or reaching a fitful decision in a 
case. It will not be out of place to mention here that this 
rule occupies a pivotal place in the Islamic law and is 
enforced rigorously in view of the saying of the Holy 
Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the “mistake of Qazi (Judge) in 
releasing a criminal is better than his mistake in 
punishing an innocent”.  
 
17. 
 
The upshot of the above discussion is that the prosecution had 
severely failed to bring home a charge against the appellant beyond any 
reasonable doubt; therefore, in the interest of the safe administration of 
Criminal Justice, Crl. Appeal No.19109 of 2019, filed by Bilal Hassan, the 
appellant, is accepted in toto. The sentence awarded by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Gujrat, vide judgment dated 25.03.2019, is set 
aside, and the appellant is acquitted of the charge in case FIR No.86/2016

dated 22.02.2016, registered under sections 302, 324 PPC at P.S. Saddar, 
District Gujrat. The appellant-Bilal Hassan, son of Ghulam Murtaza, is 
ordered to be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.  
18. 
 
Murder Reference No.81 of 2019, forwarded by the learned 
trial court for confirmation of the sentence of death inflicted upon the 
convict fails, which is answered in Negative.
