Atta Muhammad     versus     Zarai Taraqiati Bank Ltd.  
 
JUDGMENT  
Date of hearing:  09.05.2023 
Appellant by:  
Rana Muhammad Nazir Khan Saeed, Advocate.  
Respondent by:  
Rao Riasat Ali Khan, Advocate.  
 
 
 
 
MUZAMIL AKHTAR SHABIR, J:  Through this Execution 
First Appeal filed under Section 22 of the Financial Institutions 
(Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (FIO), the appellant has 
called in question order dated 27.04.2022 (impugned order) passed 
by Judge Banking Court No.1, Multan whereby non-bailable warrants 
of arrest have been issued against the appellant.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the appellant states that the impugned order 
is not sustainable as the Executing Court has issued warrants of arrest 
against the appellant, who is the judgment debtor, without proceeding 
further for disposal of the movable or immovable property of the 
appellant through auction which was against the mandate of law and 
the procedure on the subject and in conflict with principles of 
judgments reported as Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif v. Meezan Bank 
Limited and others (2019 CLD 729) and Mirza Shahid Baig v. 
National Bank of Pakistan and 8 others (2002 CLD 623) (Lahore). 
Seeks setting aside of impugned order.  
3. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/decree 
holder has defended the impugned order by stating that despite efforts 
by the court, auction proceedings were not successful as no bidder had 
turned up to purchase the mortgaged property necessitating the 

EFA No.15 of 2022 
-:2:-
initiation of remaining process of execution through arrest and 
detention of the judgment debtor/appellant.  
4. 
Perusal of record shows that suit for recovery of amount of 
Rs.898,437/- was instituted by respondent-Bank against appellant on 
25.11.2013 which was partially decreed for Rs.738,752/- with costs 
on 14.05.2014 with further direction that the amount deposited, if any, 
by the judgment debtor but not credited in the statement of account 
shall be deducted from the decretal amount at the time of execution of 
the decree. The execution proceedings for recovery of decretal amount 
were initiated against the appellant and vide order dated 17.05.2017, 
notice under Order XXI rule 66 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was 
issued through ordinary modes, registered post and courier service as 
well as through bailiff with direction that Fard Taleeqa be also 
submitted.  On 08.06.2017 Fard Taleeqa was submitted mentioning 
the mortgaged property i.e. agriculture land measuring 64 Kanals 
situated at Mouza Qutub Pur, Tehsil Mailsi, District Vehari and the 
same was ordered to be put to auction by fixing reserved price of the 
same as Rs.600,000/-.  The court auctioneer was directed to hold 
auction of the mortgaged property and to submit report; it was stated 
in the report filed on 21.02.2018 that as the judgment debtor and the 
decree holder were not available at the spot and no bidder appeared to 
purchase the property on the date fixed for auction i.e. 15.11.2017, the 
auction proceedings were adjourned after waiting for some time at the 
spot i.e. property to be put to auction. Subsequently, as auction 
proceedings were not successful because the buyers were not 
approaching to purchase the property, the court on application of 
decree holder bank filed on 05.01.2019 issued notices to the appellant 
under Order XXI rule 37 CPC and on receipt of the report that the 
appellant had refused to receive said notice initiated proceedings for 
arrest of appellant/judgment debtor vide order dated 11.02.2019 and 
issued bailable/non-bailable warrants of arrest against him on various 
dates whereafter the judgment debtor filed an application for setting 
aside ex parte proceedings with application for leave to defend, upon 

EFA No.15 of 2022 
-:3:-
which on 22.02.2022, the court directed the judgment debtor to submit 
1/4th of the decretal amount of Rs.738,752/- and suspended the auction 
proceedings; however, due to non-compliance of the said order, the 
court again issued warrants of arrest vide order dated 09.03.2022 and 
repeated the same on 27.04.2022; whereafter the appellant filed the 
instant Execution First Appeal before this Court against the said order 
which was listed for hearing on 23.05.2022 and operation of 
impugned order was suspended.  
5. 
The grievance of appellant is that not only the appellant had not 
been allowed to contest the suit against him but his application for 
setting aside ex parte decree as well as PLA have also not been 
considered on merits solely for the reason that 1/4th of the decretal 
amount could not be deposited by the appellant in court and the said 
applications i.e. PLA, application for setting aside ex parte decree and 
application for condonation of delay were dismissed and non-bailable 
warrants of arrest were issued against him despite the fact that 
mortgaged property could be put to auction to recover the decretal 
amount.   
6. 
It is not the case of the respondent-Bank that the appellant was 
instrumental in stopping, preventing or causing hinderance in the 
proceedings for auction of mortgaged property or had obstructed the 
same in any manner or had tried to dishonestly transfer the mortgaged 
property to prevent its sale in execution of decree by putting the same 
to auction or tried to abscond or leave the jurisdiction of the court to 
avoid execution of decree or had sufficient funds to pay the decretal 
amount but avoiding to do the same resulting in necessity for issuance 
of his warrants of arrest rather the failure of auction proceedings was 
due to the fact that no person appeared at auction proceedings for 
bidding to purchase the mortgaged property, which inter alia may 
have been due to the reason that auction proceedings had not been 
properly advertised. The aforesaid inference drawn by this Court is 
strengthened by the report submitted by the court auctioneer wherein 

EFA No.15 of 2022 
-:4:-
it is specifically mentioned that neither the representatives of the 
decree holder bank nor the judgment debtor was available on the spot 
and buyer has also not approached to purchase the mortgaged property 
being put to auction and conclusion could be drawn that serious effort 
to put the property to auction had not been made. Besides no other 
effort to put the property to auction was subsequently made by the 
decree holder bank rather application for arrest and detention of the 
judgment debtor was filed on which proceedings by issuance of 
warrants of arrest had been initiated, hence, in the said circumstances 
conduct of appellant could not be treated as contumacious for drawing 
adverse inference against the appellant; besides, on the basis of 
aforementioned reasons in terms of principles laid down in the afore-
referred reported judgments in the cases of Mirza Shahid Baig and 
Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif, warrants of arrest could not be 
issued against the appellant. The relevant portion of judgment passed 
by this Court in Mirza Shahid Baig’s case (supra) is reproduced below 
for reference:  
“2. 
We have heard both the learned counsel and, in particular, 
the learned counsel of the judgment-debtor Bank. It is evident that 
the decree obtained by the respondent-Bank is to be satisfied 
through sale of the properties mentioned in the Fard Taleeqa. The 
Banking Court should, in the first instance, attempt to sell the said 
properties and only in the event the sale proceeds are not sufficient 
to satisfy the decree, or the judgment-debtor impedes the sale or 
commits other prejudicial acts that it would  be proper to proceed 
against the judgment-debtor personally.  In this view of the matter, 
we would modify the impugned order and hold that there was no 
justification on 31.10.2001, for issuing warrants of arrest against 
the appellant Mirza Shahid Baig.”  
7. 
The afore-referred passage from the judgment of case of Mirza 
Shahid Baig (supra) was considered as valid ground not to arrest the 
judgment debtor in the case of Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif (supra), in 
which this Court held as under:- 
“In the instant case the Executing Court has not dealt with the application 
of the appellant with procedural fairness which is right of every citizen 
without creating distinction between decree-holder or the judgment 
debtor. The impugned order clearly offends the modes of execution of a 
decree as prescribed in section 51 of the C.P.C. In order to better 
appreciate the issue in hand I feel it expedient to reproduce section 51 of 
the C.P.C. as under: 

EFA No.15 of 2022 
-:5:-
"51. Powers of Court to enforce execution.-Subject to such conditions 
and limitations as may be prescribed, the Court may, on the 
application of the decree-holder, order execution of the decree -- 
 (a) by delivery of any property specifically decreed; 
(b) by attachment and sale or by sale without attachment of any 
property; 
(c) by arrest and detention in prison; 
 (d) by appointing a receiver; or 
 (e) in such other manner as the nature of the relief granted may 
require: 
Provided that, execution by detention in prison shall not be ordered 
unless, after giving the judgment-debtor an opportunity of showing 
cause why he should not be committed to prison, the Court, for 
reasons recorded in writing, is satisfied - 
(a) that the judgment-debtor, with the object or effect of obstructing or 
delaying the execution of the decree, -- 
(i) is likely to abscond or leave the local limits of the jurisdiction of the 
Court, or 
(ii) has, after the institution of the suit in which the decree was passed, 
dishonestly transferred, concealed, or removed any part of his 
property, or committed any other act of bad faith in relation to his 
property; or 
(b) that the judgment-debtor has, or has had since the date of the 
decree, the means to pay the amount of the decree or some substantial 
part thereof and refuses or neglects or has refused or neglected to pay 
the same, or 
(c) that the decree is for a sum for which the judgment-debtor was 
bound in a fiduciary capacity to account." 
A thoughtful study of the above said provisions of law keeping in view the 
facts and circumstances of the instant case leads to hold that in this case 
there existed none of reasons explained in the above said provisions of law 
for detention of the judgment-debtor in prison. The learned Executing 
Court was not justified in refusing application for cancellation of 
warrants of arrest of the appellant/judgment debtor. Needless to state that 
the legislative intent is to ensure that a decree of the court is satisfied in 
full, in the shortest possible time. The intent, behavior, attitude, conduct 
etc. of the judgment debtor is very much essential to determine how the 
Executing Court should deal with the judgment debtor. Where the Court 
finds that the judgment debtor has, or has had since the date of decree, the 
means to pay the amount of the decree or some substantial part thereof 
and refuses or neglects or has refused or neglected to pay the same only 
then it can commit the judgment debtor to prison. Notwithstanding the 
above vast powers given to the Executing Court it is also the legislative 
intention to protect the citizens from personal humiliation in the capacity 
of a judgment debtor, therefore, the law provides the mode of execution of 
the decree by way of attachment and auction of his/her movable and 
immovable property at the first instance to satisfy the decree and in the 
absence of satisfaction of the decretal amount only in terms of the 

EFA No.15 of 2022 
-:6:-
provisions envisaged in section 51 of the C.P.C. supra, the court can 
resort to committing a judgment debtor to prison. As the Executing Court 
in this case has passed the impugned order against the legislative intent 
and mandate of the law supra, therefore, the same is not sustainable in the 
eye of law. 
6.    In view of above, the instant appeal is allowed and the impugned 
order dated 15.7.2013 is set aside.” 
8. 
It is important to note here that in the judgment reported as 
Aftab Saleem Choudhary and another v. Soneri Bank Limited through 
Attorneys (2005 CLD 401), a learned Division Bench of this Court 
while setting aside the warrants of arrest of the judgment debtor held 
as under: 
“4. As mentioned above suit for recovery of Rs.48,19,411 brought by 
respondent-Bank against the appellants was decreed but appellants failed 
to pay decretal amount, therefore, respondent filed execution petition. 
However the property mortgaged by the judgment-debtors was not 
auctioned, therefore, learned trial Court issued warrants of arrest of the 
appellants/judgment debtors. The case of appellants is that learned 
Executing Court had issued warrants of arrest of the appellants in 
violation of provisions of section 51, C.P.C. and the case of Precision 
Engineering Limited and others v. The Grays Leasing Limited PLD 2000 
Lahore 290 and that no serious effort was made for auction of the 
property already mortgaged by them. According to section 51, C.P.C. the 
pre-conditions for issuance of warrant of arrest are that judgment-debtor 
should be proved to have made attempt to leave the limits of Court to 
obstruct the decree or execution thereof or dishonestly transferred the 
property after the institution of the suit to avoid the decree or had the 
means to pay the decree and neglected to do the same. So without 
satisfaction of these pre-conditions no mechanical order for detention in 
prison can be passed. Reliance can also be placed on the case cited above. 
However it is clear from the record that learned Court below passed the 
impugned order only on the ground that property mortgaged by judgment-
debtor-appellant could not be auctioned. The appellants have mentioned 
in Para. No.4 of memo. of appeal, the detail of property mentioned in 
'Farad Taleeka' filed by decree-holder/bank and the same could satisfy the 
decree. As such in the circumstances of the case, there was no justification 
for issuance of warrants of arrest of appellants. So impugned order is not 
sustainable in the eye of law and the same is liable to be set aside. 
5. The upshot of the above discussion is that this appeal is accepted and 
impugned order is accordingly set aside. However learned Executing 
Court would be competent to issue warrants of arrest subject to 
satisfaction of conditions stated in section 51, C.P.C. No order as to 
costs.” 
9. 
Later on, the Banking Court in its capacity of Executing Court 
again issued warrants of arrest of Aftab Saleem Choudhry, the 
judgment debtor in the afore referred case which were again set aside 
by this Court through judgment reported as Aftab Saleem Choudhary 

EFA No.15 of 2022 
-:7:-
and another v. Soneri Bank Limited through Attorneys (2007 YLR 
107 Lahore) by observing as under: 
“3. Learned counsel for the appellants contends that the warrants of 
arrest of appellant No.1 were issued without complying with the 
requirements of proviso to section 51, C.P.C. and in complete ignorance 
of the previous judgment rendered by this Court in EFA No.510 of 2003. 
Conversely the learned counsel for the respondent, while supporting the 
impugned order, submits that the appeal is not competent and is 
premature, as the warrants of arrest were never executed. 
4. We, after hearing the learned counsel and examining the available 
record, are of the view that both the contentions raised by the learned 
counsel have considerable force. It is evident from the bare perusal of the 
impugned order that the learned executing Court, after finding that the 
judgment-debtors are delaying the execution proceedings and they have 
no bona fide claim, proceeded to dismiss their application and abruptly 
issued warrants of arrest of the judgment-debtor. Admittedly, the learned 
Banking Court issued the warrants of arrest without adhering and 
adverting to the provisions of proviso to section 51, C.P.C. It is settled law 
by now that an executing Court without satisfaction of the pre-conditions 
and prerequisites of proviso to section 51, C.P.C., viz. the judgment-
debtor is likely to abscond or leave the local limits of jurisdiction of the 
Court; to obstruct the decree has transferred the property; the judgment-
debtor has no means to pay the amount of decree and refuses or neglects 
to pay and that the decree is for a sum for which the judgment-debtor is 
bound in a fiduciary capacity to account to the satisfaction of the 
Executing Court, is not competent and empowered to issue warrants of 
arrest of a judgment-debtor and is precluded from passing a mechanical 
order in this regard. Reference can be made to Aftab Saleem Choudhary 
and another v. Soneri Bank Limited through Attorneys 2005 CLD 401; 
Messrs 3-A Trade Impex through Partner and 2 others v. Askari 
Commercial Bank Ltd. through Branch Manager 2005 CLD 1379 and 
Bashir Ahmad v. Judge Banking Court-I, Gujranwala Division 
Gujranwala and another 2005 CLD 1728. 
5. Obviously, the learned executing Court passed the impugned order in 
complete oblivion and derogation of the decisions of this Court and 
consistent principles of law decided by this Court in the aforesaid 
judgments. Needless to mention that the decisions of this Court to the 
extent that it decides a question of law or based upon or enunciated a 
principle of law, are binding on all the Courts, per force of Article 201 of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. 
6. There is another aspect of the case. The appellants, under the similar 
circumstances, on a previous occasion, filed the appeal (EFA No.510 of 
2003). This Court, while allowing the appeal observed that "the learned 
executing Court would be competent to issue warrants of arrest subject to 
the satisfaction of conditions stated in section 51, C.P.C.". Strangely 
enough, the learned Judge Banking Court passed the impugned order in 
violation of the said observations and reiterated the legal error. 
7. Seeing from any angle the impugned order suffers from grave legal 
infirmities and we are persuaded to set it aside. 
8. In view of the above, the present appeal is allowed and the impugned 
order is set aside with no order as to costs. Before parting with the order, 
it may be observed that in case the respondent-Bank's application under 

EFA No.15 of 2022 
-:8:-
section 51, C.P.C. is pending or is filed in future, the same shall be 
decided by the learned executing Court on its own merits and in view of 
the provisions of proviso to section 51, C.P.C., as discussed above.” 
10. 
The same principles were adopted in a judgment reported as 
Mansoor Ali v. Haji Liaquat Ali and another (2016 CLC Note 82). 
Moreover, in the case reported as Messrs Azhar & Co and others v. 
National Bank of Pakistan (2018 CLD 830), the warrants of arrest of 
judgment-debtor were set aside; a passage of the said judgment was 
later referred in the judgment reported as Muhammad Shafeeq v. 
United Bank Limited (2021 CLD 1002) to set aside the warrants of 
arrest issued against the judgment debtor in the said case; the 
operative portion of which is reproduced below:- 
“7.    Before passing any order of arrest, finding is required to be 
recorded by the Court to the effect that the Court is satisfied that decree 
cannot be executed by delivery of any property or by attachment and sale 
or sale without attachment of any property. This preposition has already 
been settled in number of cases including case titled “Messrs Azhar and 
Co. and others v. National Bank of Pakistan (2018 CLD 830), the relevant 
part of the same is as under:- 
“6. In fact the provisions of section 51 and Order XXI, Rule 37, 
C.P.C. intend to provide an opportunity to the judgment-debtor to pay 
the amount or to show cause, as to why he was defaulting to pay the 
decretal amount. Chance must be given to the judgment-debtor to pay 
the decretal amount unless the conduct of the judgment-debtor is not 
bona fide or his object is to effect the delay of the execution of the 
decree or the judgment-debtor is likely to abscond or leave the local 
limits of the jurisdiction of the Court or after the institution of the suit, 
he has transferred dishonestly his property or any part of his property 
concealed or removed any part of his property or has done any other 
act or committed any act of bad faith with regard to his property so as 
to deprive the decree holder in the satisfaction of the decree. When 
these or other acts of these kinds are not found in a case, the 
Execution Court cannot order straightway the arrest or detention of 
the judgment-debtor in the execution. It may be pointed out here that 
these pre-conditions are not exhaustive. There may be other 
conditions and circumstances of exceptional cases, which could 
satisfy the judicial conscience of the Court to adopt such course of 
arrest and detention of the judgment-debtor in a given case. 
Furthermore, the Respondent has not submitted any written 
application for issuance of warrants of arrest against the Appellants 
as per requirements of the Order XXI, Rule 37, C.P.C. 
8.    Adopting the coercive measures, without due course of law will also 
violate Article 10-A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973. This Court in the case titled “Dr. Rauf Ahmad Azhar v. Banking 
Court No.II, Lahore and 6 others” (2007 CLD 964) involving similar 
facts, has taken the following view: 
“4. Perusal of the record appended with this petition reveals that the 
contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner are not without force. 
There is no allegation on the record that the petitioner is guilty of any 

EFA No.15 of 2022 
-:9:-
act or omission specified in section 51 C.P.C. which would make him 
liable for detention in pursuance of execution of a decree. No 
preliminary inquiry appears to have been conducted and it was not 
even prima facie established that the petitioner was liable to be 
arrested and detained. No citizen can be deprived of his liberty 
without due process of law. 
9.    Further reliance, in this regard, can be placed on cases titled 
“Muhammad Ashraf v. Mst. Safia Bibi” (2008 CLC 1583), “Altaf Hussain 
and others v. Z.T.B.L. and others” (2019 LHC 857), “Muhammad Mobeen 
v. A.B.N. Amro Bank Limited through Manager” (2015 CLD 1904), 
“Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif v. Meezan Bank Limited and others” (2019 
CLD 729), “Bashir Ahmad v. Judge Banking Court-I, Gujranwala 
Division Gujranwala and another” (2005 CLD 1728), “Habib Ahmad v. 
Haji Munir Ahmad” (2004 YLR 1540), “Mehboob Alam v. Federation of 
Pakistan through Secretary Finance and 2 others” (2003 CLD 1705), 
“Mst. Munawar Khanum v. Messrs. Habib Bank Ltd. and 3 others” (2006 
CLD 1508), “Major (Retd.) Mahmood Hussain v. Habib Bank Limited and 
another” (2001 CLC 2016), “Ghulam Nabi v. Banking Court No.II, 
Gujranwala and others” (2001 YLR 625), “Aftab Saleem Choudhary and 
another v. Soneri Bank Limited through Attorneys” (2005 CLD 401) and 
“Abdul Qayyum Arif v. Agha Gul and 2 others” (2002 YLR 2541). 
10.  Request on the basis of bald allegations without reference to any 
material evidence or fact merely to procure a coercive order, without 
adequate efforts to satisfy the decree by adopting the other modes 
provided in law is highly unjustified. No mechanical order for detention or 
arrest can be passed. The pre-condition for issuing of warrants of arrests 
should be proved to have satisfied and the Courts should ensure that the 
debtor is likely to leave the limits of the Court to frustrate the decree or 
execution thereof or debtor has dishonestly transferred the property to 
avoid the decree or he has means to pay the decree and neglecting to do 
the same must be reflected from the record before adopting such coercive 
measures.” 
11. 
The perusal of Section 51 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
and principles laid down in the afore-referred judgments make it clear 
that warrants of arrest of judgment debtor can only be issued in cases 
where the Court was satisfied that in order to obstruct or delay the 
execution of decree, the judgment-debtor is likely to abscond or leave 
the limits of Court or has after the institution of the suit in which 
decree was passed, dishonestly transferred, concealed or removed any 
part of his property, or committed any other act of bad faith in relation 
to his property, or the judgment-debtor has, or has had since the date 
of decree, the means to pay the amount of the decree or some 
substantial part thereof and refuses or neglects or has refused or 
neglected to pay the same, or the decree is for a sum for which the 
judgment-debtor was bound in a fiduciary capacity to account for, and 

EFA No.15 of 2022 
-:10:-
without satisfaction of these pre-conditions no mechanical order for 
detention in prison can be passed. Although it can safely be pointed 
out here that the aforementioned pre-conditions are not complete and 
there may be other conditions and circumstances of exceptional cases, 
which could satisfy the judicial conscience of the Court to adopt such 
course of arrest and detention of the judgment-debtor in a given case 
yet where there was nothing attributable to the judgment-debtor to 
show that his acts were instrumental to frustrate the decree, which has 
caused prejudice to the other side and his property is available for 
satisfaction of the amount of decree, ordinarily warrants of arrest 
should not be issued.  
12. 
We have gone through the entire record and have reached 
conclusion that none of the afore-mentioned conditions exist in the 
present case for warranting issuance of warrants of arrest against the 
appellant-judgment debtor for the reason that property of judgment 
debtor is available for putting the same to auction for satisfaction of 
the decree and the mere fact that no one had attended the auction 
proceedings to purchase the mortgaged property (which is already 
observed by us above, may inter alia have been due to the fact that the 
auction proceedings of the said property had not been properly 
advertised and there had not been made any serious attempt to put the 
mortgaged property to auction to recover the decretal amount) could 
not in the said circumstances of case be used against the appellant to 
declare the conduct of the appellant/judgment-debtor as contumacious 
and failure of auction in such circumstances was not sufficient reason 
to satisfy the court that the case of the appellant was hit by the 
mischief of Section 51 CPC for issuance of warrants of arrest against 
him. Request for issuance of warrants of arrest to arrest and detain the 
judgment-debtor on the basis of bald allegations without reference to 
any material evidence or fact merely to procure a coercive order, 
without adequate efforts to satisfy the decree by adopting the other 
modes provided in law, is highly unjustified. Obviously, the learned 
Executing Court passed the impugned order in complete oblivion and 

EFA No.15 of 2022 
-:11:-
derogation of the decisions of this Court and consistent principles of 
law decided by this Court in the aforesaid judgments. Needless to 
mention that the decisions of this Court to the extent that it decides a 
question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law, are 
binding on all the Courts subordinate to this Court, per force of 
Article 201 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973.  Consequently, we are of the view that the impugned order 
whereby warrants of arrest of the appellant/judgment-debtor have 
been issued is not sustainable and serious attempt for sale of 
mortgaged property through open auction was required to be made so 
that the outstanding decretal amount could be recovered from the 
judgment-debtor/appellant without straightaway adopting the process 
of issuance of warrants of arrest against him for execution of decree 
through arrest and detention of judgment-debtor.  
13. 
In view of what has been discussed above this Execution First 
Appeal is allowed with the result that by setting aside impugned order 
dated 27.04.2022, whereby warrants of arrest have been issued against 
the appellant, this Court directs the learned Executing Court to 
proceed further with execution proceedings by holding auction of 
mortgaged property, in accordance with law. No order as to costs. 
14. 
However, without prejudice to what has been decided above, it 
is observed that the learned Executing Court would not be precluded 
from and shall be competent to issue warrants of arrest subject to 
satisfaction of conditions stated in Section 51 C.P.C.
