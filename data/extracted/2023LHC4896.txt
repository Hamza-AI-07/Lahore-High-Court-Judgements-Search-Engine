No. 
72138/2022, STR No. 72132/2022 and STR 
No.72130/2022 are heard together wherein 
common 
questions 
of 
law 
are 
involved. 
Following question of law, stated to have arisen 
out of the order of the Appellate Tribunal Inland 
Revenue Lahore (Appellate Tribunal) dated 
23.06.2022, is pressed and argued before us, 
which reads as, 
i). 
Whether ATIR wrongfully held that 
the conditions (i) & (ii) of SRO 670(1)/2013 
are independent of each other whereas both 
are conjunctive and supplemental to each 
other?” 
2. 
Learned counsel for applicant department 
submits refund was not permissible on the 
premise that registered person fails to fulfil the 
conditions prescribed for claiming input tax 
adjustment against local procurement of raw 
materials for manufacturing bicycles, since 

STR No. 72126/2022. 
STR No. 72127/2022, 
STR No. 72138/2022,  
STR No. 72132/2022 
STR No.72130/2022. 
 
-:2:- 
 
 
 
supply of bicycles was declared chargeable to 
zero percent tax in terms of SRO670(I)/2013 
dated 
18.07.2013. 
Submits 
that 
Appellate 
Tribunal erred in law while treating the 
conditions, contained in clauses (i) and (ii) 
mutually exclusive, which otherwise had to be 
read 
and 
interpreted 
jointly 
to 
avoid 
inconsistencies inter-se and redundancy of 
material part of the statutory order. Adds that 
availability 
of 
Input-Output 
Co-efficient 
Organization (IOCO) certificate was sine qua 
non for claiming benefit of statutory instrument. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for registered 
person pleaded separate and independent reading 
of conditions (i) and (ii) of SRO 670(1)/2013. 
Adds that registered person sought issuance of 
IOCO certificate, but procurement thereof was 
unnecessarily delayed and compelled registered 
person 
to 
procure 
raw 
materials 
for 
manufacturing.  
4. 
Controversy at hand calls for construction of 
conditions (i) and (ii), whether same have had to 
be read conjunctively or disjunctively. It is 
expedient to reproduce the condition (i) and (ii) 
(subject matter conditions) and sub-clauses (b) 
and (c) of condition (ii) of SRO 670(1)/2013, 
which read as, 
(i) 
The zero-rating under this notification 
shall 
be 
available 
subject 
to 
determination of input/output ratios 
by 
the 
Input-Output 
co-efficient 
Organization (hereinafter referred to

under 
an 
earlier 
concessionary 
notification issued for such goods: 
 
 
Provided that this condition 
shall not be applicable in case of 
import of finished goods and their 
supply in same state; and 
(ii) 
For import and local procurement of 
raw materials, packing materials, 
subcomponents, 
components, 
sub-
assemblies and assemblies for the 
manufacture of the goods specified in 
column (2) of the said Table, the 
following conditions and procedure 
shall be followed namely,  
(a) ............................ 
(b) the Commissioner shall approve 
the declaration of input-output 
ratio of the manufacturer without 
physical verification in case the 
declared input-output ratio and 
input requirement is in accordance 
with 
the 
prevailing 
industry 
average or the inputs consumption 
pattern 
of 
the 
applicant 
manufacturer 
or 
as 
already 
determined by IOCO under an 
earlier notification issued for such 
goods, in the format of approval 
prescribed as Annex-B to this 
notification; 
(c) in case the Commissioner is not 
satisfied with the declared input-
output ratios of the goods to be 
manufactured because of their 
being 
prima 
facie 
not 
in 
accordance with the prevalent 
average of the relevant industry or 
in case the input-output ratios are 
not already determined by IOCO, 
he may, after allowing a six 
months provisional quantity, make 
a reference to the IOCO for final 
determination thereof. On receipt 
of 
report 
from 
IOCO 
the 
Commissioner 
shall

the

quantitative entitlement of inputs 
and grant final approval for zero-
rated purchases or imports. In case 
of non-receipt of report from 
IOCO within four months of the 
application 
made 
by 
the 
manufacturer, the Commissioner 
shall provisionally allow another 
six

quantity

4. 
Appellate Tribunal erred in law while 
reading subject matter conditions disjunctively / 
separately, which interpretation jeopardizes the 
scope and purpose of SRO 670(1)/2013, rather 
threatens the very existence of entire Statutory 
instrument. The manner, in which, learned 
counsel for registered persons wants us to read 
subject matter conditions would in fact render 
requirements under condition (i) ineffective, 
inconsequential and optional. It is appropriate to 
dissect the real intent of condition (i), which 
necessitates the determination of input/output 
ratios. IOCO certificate is only one of the 
mode(s) for determination of input/put ratios. It 
implies that factum of determination of input/put 
ratios is the fundamental-cum-primary condition 
for claiming or extending the privilege of zero-
rating facility under SRO No.670(1)/2013. It is 
evident from perusal of sub-clause (b) of 
condition (ii) of SRO No.670(1)/2013 that 

STR No. 72126/2022. 
STR No. 72127/2022, 
STR No. 72138/2022,  
STR No. 72132/2022 
STR No.72130/2022. 
 
-:5:- 
 
 
 
requirement of determination of input/output 
ratios 
would 
be 
deemed 
fulfilled 
if 
Commissioner had approved the declaration of 
input/put ratios or determination thereof is 
otherwise available in terms of the alternatives 
provided in sub-clause (b), supra. And if 
Commissioner was not satisfied with alternatives 
available or IOCO certificate was not readily 
available, sub-clause (c) provides transitory/stop-
gap arrangement. We are not called upon or 
possess jurisdiction to dilate upon the factual 
aspect of the matter that whether registered 
person applied for procuring of IOCO certificate 
or if Commissioner had performed or failed to 
perform obligations in terms of sub-clauses (b) 
and (c) of condition (ii) – that was the domain of 
the Tribunal. We are confining determination of 
the question of law proposed. 
5. 
We disagree with the interpretation of the 
Appellate Tribunal that subject matter conditions 
exist and operate independent of each other. 
Subject matter conditions have had to be read 
and construed jointly. If condition (ii) is treated 
as separate and independent then the requirement 
of determination of input/output ratios, if not 
achieved otherwise, had to be carried out in the 
light of IOCO certificate, which appears to be 
penultimate / conclusive method of determination 
of input/out ratios for the purposes of extending 
benefit of SRO No.670(1)/2013. Sub-clause (c ) 
of condition (ii) merely provided transitory 
deferment of the determination of input/output 

STR No. 72126/2022. 
STR No. 72127/2022, 
STR No. 72138/2022,  
STR No. 72132/2022 
STR No.72130/2022.

ratios, which sub-clause does not conclusively 
provide for the effect of non-availability of IOCO 
certificate. And reading or treating non-
provisioning of certificate, after lapse of 
temporarily 
extended 
period, 
per 
se 
as 
extinguishment 
of 
the 
requirement 
of 
determination of input/output ratios in terms of 
condition (i) is offensive to the scope, purpose 
and existence of SRO No.670(1)/2013. Condition 
(i) is primary condition for seeking benefit under 
SRO No.670(1)/2013 and condition (ii) is 
ancillary 
thereto, 
a 
subordinate 
condition. 
Declaring condition (ii) as mutually exclusive 
would imply redundancy of condition (i) which is 
unwarranted. Reading of SRO No.670(1)/2013 in 
bits and pieces would contravene the intent and 
purpose of statutory instrument, which purpose is 
grant of concession but subject to scrutiny qua 
determination of input/output ratios of the 
manufacturer. 
Strict 
adherence 
to 
the 
requirements of SRO No.670(1)/2013 would 
ensure supply of completely assembled bicycles 
and not the sale of parts of bicycles – which is 
the mischief sought to be addressed by 
introducing 
statutory 
instrument. 
Hence, 
harmonious reading of subject matter conditions 
would 
ensure 
enforcement 
of 
SRO 
No.670(1)/2013 in letter and spirit and lawful 
gaining of advantages / concessions extended 
thereunder.

In view of the above, question is answered 
in the affirmative and reference application is 

STR No. 72126/2022.

decided in favour of the department and against 
the registered person.  
  
Since Appellate Tribunal had decided the lis 
before it based on erroneous construction of 
subject matter conditions therefore, we remand 
the matter to the Tribunal to decide appeal of the 
registered person afresh upon reading conditions 
(i) and (ii) of SRO No.670(1)/2013 conjunctively 
and not disjunctively.

Office shall send a copy of this order, under
