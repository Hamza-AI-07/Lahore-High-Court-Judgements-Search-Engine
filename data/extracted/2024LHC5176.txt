Date of hearing:     13.11.2024.                                                     
Petitioners by:

Respondents by: 
Ch. Lehrasib Khan Gondal, Advocate (for 
respondent No.3).  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.:- This 
writ petition is directed against the order dated 22.07.2024 & judgment 
dated 05.09.2024, passed by learned Civil Judge and Additional 
District Judge, Samundri, respectively, whereby applications for 
setting aside ex parte proceedings dated 22.11.2023, filed by 
petitioners No.1 to 3 and petitioner No.4, respectively, were 
concurrently dismissed.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondent No.3 filed suit for 
recovery of damages amounting to Rs.20,000,000/- (Rupees Twenty 
Million only) against the petitioners, which was contested by 
petitioners No.1 to 3 and petitioner No.4 by filing their respective 
written statements. Learned Trial Court framed issues. During the 
course of proceedings, petitioners were proceeded against ex parte vide 
order dated 22.11.2023. Petitioners No.1 to 3 and petitioner No.4 
moved their respective applications for setting aside aforesaid ex parte 
proceedings, which was contested by respondent No.3 by way of filing 
written reply. After hearing respective arguments of learned counsel 
for the parties, learned Trial Court proceeded to dismiss the aforesaid 
applications vide order dated 22.07.2024. Feeling aggrieved, 

 
2 
Writ Petition No.69059 of 2024 
 
petitioners filed revision petition, which was also dismissed vide 
judgment dated 05.09.2024. Hence, instant petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioners submits that petitioners’ 
applications for setting aside ex parte proceedings have been 
concurrently dismissed by learned Courts below with the observation 
that said application is barred by time as the same was filed after 30-
days. He adds that limitation for filing such application is 03-years, 
therefore, impugned decisions, being contrary to the applicable law, 
are unsustainable. In support, he has relied upon Messrs Rehman 
Weaving Factory (Regd.), Bahawalnagar v. Industrial Development 
Bank of Pakistan (PLD 1981 Supreme Court 21) and Muhammad 
Ramzan v. Malik Rehmat Ullah and others (2014 MLD 451).  
4. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.3 defends 
the impugned decisions.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
6. 
Record shows that petitioners initially contested the suit filed by 
respondent No.3 by filing their written statements, whereafter issues 
were framed by learned Trial Court. However, during the course of 
proceedings, petitioners were proceeded against ex parte vide order 
dated 22.11.2023. It is the stance of petitioners that since petitioners 
No.1 to 3 are barely educated who are not familiar with the legal 
intricacies and petitioner No.4 is living abroad, represented through his 
counsel, therefore, upon assurances of their counsel to keep them 
informed about the proceedings of the suit, petitioners remained 
unaware of the developments and were ultimately proceeded against ex 
parte as a result of collusiveness of their counsel. Whereas, the 
applications for setting aside ex parte proceedings were dismissed on 
the ground of limitation as ex parte proceedings were initiated vide 
order dated 22.11.2023 and applications for setting aside ex parte 
proceedings were filed on 16.05.2024 and 10.06.2024.   
7. 
Needless to say that Article 163 of the Limitation Act, 1908 
provides limitation of 30-days for a plaintiff to seek setting aside of 
order of dismissal of suit for default, whereas Article 164 prescribes 

 
3 
Writ Petition No.69059 of 2024 
 
limitation of 30-days for a defendant to seek setting aside of ex parte 
decree. None of these Articles or any other specific Article cater the 
situation qua limitation for filing application for setting aside ex 
parte proceedings. In these circumstances, it would be governed by 
the residuary Article 181 of the Act ibid, which provides a limitation 
period of 03-years from the date the right to sue accrues. It is also 
well settled that even if the defendants are proceeded ex parte, they 
may join the proceedings at any subsequent stage and file an 
appropriate application for setting aside ex parte order, provided 
they show good cause. A person nevertheless declared ex parte, 
remains as party to the proceedings and may even cross-examine the 
witnesses. If good cause is shown to the satisfaction of the Court 
justifying their previous absenteeism, the ex parte proceedings may 
be set aside by the Court and the defendant may then be restored to 
the position he held before being proceeded against ex parte. This 
rule invests the Court with the wide-ranging potential discretion to 
allow the application if the defendant who was declared ex parte 
assigns good cause for previous absence. Even otherwise, in the 
absence of any clear provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure 
prohibiting the appearance and participating in the proceedings by the 
defendant, proceeded ex parte, there can be no legal bar to allow him 
to defend his rights. It is the right of every defendant and also a 
principle of natural justice, to be given a chance of hearing before any 
order is passed against his interest. Reliance is placed upon Police 
Department through Deputy Inspector-General of Police and another 
v. Javid Israr and 7 others (1992 SCMR 1009) and Muhammad 
Yousuf Bhindi and others v. Messrs A.G.E. & Sons (Pvt.) Ltd. and 
others (PLD 2024 Supreme Court 864).  
8. 
Admittedly, the suit is still pending before learned Trial Court 
and valuable rights of the petitioners are said to be involved in the 
subject litigation, therefore, in such a situation, it would be 
unjustified to dislodge them from the active contest on the basis of 
technicalities. Reliance is placed upon the case of Messrs Rehman

Writ Petition No.69059 of 2024 
 
Weaving Factory supra and Rana Karamat v. Farhan Haider and 6 
others (2024 CLC 563).  
9. 
Resultantly, instant petition is allowed and impugned order 
dated 22.07.2024 & judgment dated 05.09.2024, passed by learned 
Civil Judge and Additional District Judge, Samundri, respectively, are 
declared to be illegal and without lawful authority. Consequently, the 
applications for setting aside ex parte proceedings, filed by petitioners, 
are allowed and order for initiating ex parte proceedings dated 
22.11.2023, is set aside.
