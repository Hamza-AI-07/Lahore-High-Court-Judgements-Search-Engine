Date of Hearing: 
17.10.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Syed 
Riaz-ul-Hassan 
Gillani, 
Advocate. 
Respondent No.3 by: Mr. Ahmad Raza, Advocate. 
Respondents No.4 
and 5 by: 
Mr. Khalid Masood Ghani, Assistant 
Advocate General.  
 
       
Anwaar Hussain, J.  Respondent No.3, namely, Dr. Maria 
Khan (“the respondent”) instituted a suit for declaration against the 
petitioner and respondents No.4 and 5, inter alia, on the ground that 
after delegating right of divorce to the respondent, the petitioner has 
no right to pronounce talaq and therefore, respondents No.4 and 5 
who are Administrator, Union Council No.3, MDA Chowk, Multan 
and Secretary, Union Council No.3, Shadab Colony, Multan, 
respectively, be restrained from issuing certificate of effectiveness of 
divorce. Ad-interim injunction was granted by the  learned Trial 
Court, vide impugned order dated 05.08.2024, which has been 
further extended, vide orders dated 11.09.2024 as well as 
28.09.2024. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner filed appeal, alongwith 
application for condonation of delay, before the learned Addl. 
District Judge, Multan, which has been dismissed, vide impugned 
order dated 07.10.2024. Hence, the present constitutional petition.

W.P. No.13290 of 2024 
 
 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the declaratory 
suit instituted by the respondent was not maintainable from its 
inception and entertaining the same, alongwith application under 
Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, 
and granting ad-interim injunction, restraining the Union Council to 
issue certificate of effectiveness of divorce, pronounced by the 
petitioner (as husband), is erroneous exercise of jurisdiction. Adds 
that the impugned order dated 05.08.2024 is unlawful and when 
appeal was preferred against the said order, the same has been 
dismissed on the ground of limitation and both the findings are 
against the injunctions of Islam.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent submits that 
the petition is not maintainable as challenge has been laid to the 
interlocutory order of the learned Trial Court. Adds that the 
petitioner contracted second marriage with the respondent and 
concealed factum of his earlier marriage and thereafter is eschewing 
away from his obligation of incorporating the factum of his marriage 
with the respondent in the record of NADRA, which not only 
amounts to denying the respondent with her due legal status but also 
entails social repercussions for her. Further adds that it is only at the 
behest of the first wife of the petitioner that reconciliation 
proceedings are not successful for which intervention of the Trial 
Court was sought. Contends that once the right to pronounce talaq is 
delegated, the petitioner has lost the authority to pronounce talaq 
and therefore, notice of talaq issued by the petitioner is liable to be 
set aside.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
5. 
The case involves following questions of law for the 
determination by this Court: 

3 
W.P. No.13290 of 2024 
 
 
i. 
Whether the present petition is maintainable 
as the impugned orders are interlocutory in 
nature? 
ii. 
Whether the learned Civil Court is vested with 
the jurisdiction to try the declaratory suit, inter 
alia, regarding the reconciliation proceedings, 
issuance of certificate of effectiveness of 
divorce in the light of Section 5 of the West 
Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 (“Act, 
1964”)? 
iii. 
Whether a husband loses the right to 
pronounce talaq, once such right is delegated 
to the wife? 
iv. 
Whether an order can be passed by the learned 
Civil Court restraining the officials of the 
Union Council concerned from performing 
their duties qua reconciliation and issue 
certificate of effectiveness of divorce, after 
pronouncement of talaq by the petitioner? 
6. 
Before rendering the decision on the above quoted legal 
questions, it will be imperative to observe that in Islam, great 
emphasis is laid on the marital union. Islam directs its believers to 
lead a life not only participative with the worldly affairs but also 
dedicative in striving for excellence in the religion, however, 
despite acknowledging sacrosanct nature of the marriage, Quran 
gave its followers the option of divorce/khula, which indeed is the 
most disapproved activity. At the same time, once the divorce is 
pronounced, it becomes automatically effective after lapse of ninety 
days and it is only between the said period that efforts of 
reconciliation shall be made.  
7. 
As regards the first question, there is no cavil to the legal 
proposition that a constitutional petition is not maintainable against 
the interim orders passed by the Family Courts. However, in 
present case the impugned orders have been passed by the Civil 
Court and not by the Family Court. Moreover, if interlocutory 
orders are arbitrary, capricious and without jurisdiction, this Court 

4 
W.P. No.13290 of 2024 
 
 
in constitutional jurisdiction, can interfere by issuing a writ of 
certiorari in terms of Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 for correcting gross errors of 
jurisdiction. In this regard, case reported as “Inaam-ul-Haq vs. 
Muhammad Ali Shaheen and another” (2013 CLC 904) is referred. 
8. 
As regards the second question, it is noted that Section 5 (1) 
of the Act, 1964 reads as under: 
“5. 
Jurisdiction.– [1] Subject to the 
provisions of the Muslim Family Laws 
Ordinance, 1961, and the Conciliation Courts 
Ordinance, 1961, the Family Courts shall have 
exclusive jurisdiction to entertain, hear and 
adjudicate upon matters specified in the Part I 
of the Schedule.”   
Entry 1 of the Part I of the Schedule reads as under: 
“1. Dissolution of marriage including Khula.” 
Similarly, entry 10 of the said Schedule reads a sunder: 
“10. Any other matter arising out of the 
Nikahnama”  
 The Supreme Court of Pakistan, in case reported as “Major 
Muhammad Khalid Karim v. Mst. Saadia Yaqub and others” (PLD 
2012 SC 66) observed as under: 
“5……Prior to the enforcement of Family 
Courts Act, 1964, the disputes, relating to and 
concerning 
the 
family 
affairs 
(except 
guardianship etc.) such as the dissolution of 
marriage, 
recovery 
of 
dower, 
dowery, 
maintenance, enforcement of conjugal rights 
and jactitation etc. (subject to the amendment 
of the schedule to the Act 1964 from time to 
time) were within the jurisdiction of ordinary 
civil court. Whereas, the issues about the 
guardianship and custody of the minors were 
the subject matter of the Guardian Courts 

5 
W.P. No.13290 of 2024 
 
 
constituted under Guardians and Wards 
Act,1890. It seems that on account of delays, 
in the adjudication of this class of cases, 
which possibly was due to the complexity of 
procedure and the rush of work in such courts, 
but undoubtedly was adversely affecting the 
family union and comity, the legislature in 
order to prevent the above enforced the Act, 
1964. It is so clear from the preamble of the 
Act that this law was enforced with a vivid 
object to takeout the matters falling within the 
ambit thereof from the ordinary regime qua 
dispensation of justice, and for the expeditious 
disposal of such matters, special forum was 
created in which the rigors of procedural 
implications and the requirements of the 
Evidence Law (Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984) were either dispensed with or were 
simplified; with an addition of a statutory 
mechanism, enabling the parties for an 
amicable settlement of their disputes, through 
the courtesy of the Court was provided. 
Therefore, to achieve the aforesaid object, 
section 5 of the Act, 1964 conferred exclusive 
jurisdiction to the Family Court to entertain, 
hear and adjudicate upon matters specified in 
Part-I of the schedule to the Act. It may be 
pertinent to refer here, that if the original Act, 
1964 is examined there were six entries/items 
to the schedule, relating to the matters about 
dissolution of marriage, dower, maintenance, 
restitution of conjugal rights, custody of the 
children and guardianship. However, these 
items have been increased from time to time 
e.g. khula' is added to the dissolution cases; 
the custody issues also involve visitation 
rights of the parents to meet the minors; 
jactitation of marriage, dowery, personal 
property and personal belongings of the wife 
have also been made part thereof and 
subjected to the jurisdiction of the Family 
Court.” 
 

6 
W.P. No.13290 of 2024 
 
 
It is clear from the above quoted legal provisions as also dicta laid 
down in case of Major Muhammad Khalid Karim supra that 
exclusive jurisdiction has been conferred on the Family Court, 
established under Section 3 of the Act, 1964 to deal with 
matrimonial issues and the jurisdiction of other Courts including 
Civil Courts has been excluded and ousted. Thus, dissolution of 
marriage in all its modes and manners including khula and talaq-e-
tafweez falls within the purview and jurisdiction of the Family 
Court.  
9. 
In addition, it is also to be noted that Section 5 of the Act, 
1964 has been subjected to the provisions of the Muslim Family 
Laws Ordinance, 1961 (“Ordinance, 1961”). Section 3 of the 
Ordinance, 1961 also confers overriding effect to the Ordinance, 
1961 and Section 7 provides for the mechanism and procedure to be 
adopted for pronouncing divorce and issuance of certificate of 
effectiveness of divorce. In terms of Section 7(1) of the Ordinance, 
1961 it has been contemplated as under: 
“S. 7 ‘Talaq’. (1) Any man who wishes to divorce his 
wife shall, as soon as may be after the pronouncement of 
talaq in any form whatsoever, give the Chairman notice 
in writing of his having done so, and shall supply a copy 
thereof to the wife. 
(2) Whoever, contravenes the provisions of sub-section 
(1) shall be punishable with simple imprisonment for a 
term which may extend to one year, or with fine which 
may extend to five thousand rupees, or with both.” 
Sub-section (1) of Section 7 obligates any person who wishes to 
pronounce divorce to serve notice thereof to the chairman and also 
supply a copy thereof to the wife and sub-section (2) of the same 
provision makes non-adherence to the provision of preceding sub-
section an offence punishable with imprisonment of fine. Thus, the 
impugned restraining order/ad-interim injunction by the learned 
Civil Court would amount to aiding the non-adherence to the 

7 
W.P. No.13290 of 2024 
 
 
statutory provision, which has been made an offence by the 
legislature. Thus, the second question is answered in the terms that 
the impugned orders passed by the learned Civil Court are without 
jurisdiction. 
10. As regards the third question, it is pertinent to note that the 
respondent in her plaint stated as under: 
“18. That the Nikah of plaintiff and defendant no.3 has 
been solemnized on 22-08-2016, at the time of Nikah 
defendant no.3 has surrender his rights of divorce as per 
column-18 and 19 of Nikah Nama, only plaintiff has 
right to announced divorce, so called divorce notice 
issued by the defendant No.3 is illegal, against fact, only 
use for blackmailing purpose, against the column no.18 
and 19 of Nikah Nama and against the right of “Tafeez-e-
Talaq” hence liable to be cancelled and set-aside.” 
11. Admittedly, the petitioner has delegated the right to 
pronounce talaq in favour of the respondent in terms of entry 
recorded against Column No.18 of the nikahnama. The said act of 
the petitioner does not mean that the petitioner has denounced his 
own right to pronounce the talaq and intimate factum of 
pronouncement of talaq to the Union Council concerned, for further 
proceedings leading to the issuance of certificate of effectiveness of 
divorce in terms of provisions of the Ordinance, 1961. In terms of 
Ayat No.227 of Surah Al-Baqarah as also Ayat No.1 of Surah at-
Talaq, the husband has been conferred an absolute right to divorce 
his wife and even if said right is delegated to the wife, under the 
law of land, his own right of pronouncing divorce cannot be 
considered to be denounced. In terms of Para 101, Chapter XII of 
the Code of Muslim Personal Law, authored by Dr. Tanzil-ur-
Rehman, the delegation of right of divorce (Tafwid at-Talaq) has 
been dealt with in the following manner: 

8 
W.P. No.13290 of 2024 
 
 
’’وفتضی الطق 
101
-وشرھ ےک ےیل اج زئ ےھ ہک وہ اینپ ز وہج 
 وک قح الطق وفتضی رک دے رگم
اس وصرت ںیم وخد اس اک قح الطق اسطق ہن وھ اگ۔‘‘
 
Moreover, it is an accepted position of law that to delegate to 
another is not to denude oneself as held by Indian Supreme Court in 
case reported as “Ishwar Singh v. State of Rajasthan and others” 
(AIR 2005 Supreme Court 773). 
“8. 
It is an accepted position in law that to 'delegate' to 
another is not to denude yourself. As was observed by 
Wills, J. in Huth v. Clarke (25 Q.B.D. 391, "In my 
opinion the word, in its general sense and as generally 
used, does not imply, or point to, a giving up of authority, 
but rather the conferring of authority upon someone 
else". As observed by Lord Coleridge, C.J. in 25 Q.B.D. 
304, the word 'delegation' implies that powers are 
committed to another person or body which are as a rule, 
always subject to resumption by the power delegating. 
The person delegating does not denude himself. (Per 
Wharton's Law Lexicon, 1976 Reprint Ed. at page 316). 
Delegation implies also the power to withdraw 
delegation. As indicated in Wharton's Law Lexicon, 
delegation is a sending away; a putting into commission; 
the assignment of a debt to another; the entrusting 
another with a general power to act for the good of those 
who depute him. The word 'delegate' means little more 
than an agent. An agent exercises no power of his own 
but only the powers of his principal. The observation in 
Huth's case (supra) was referred to in Roop Chand's case 
(supra). In general, a delegation of power does not imply 
parting with authority. The delegating body will retain 
not only power to revoke the grant, but also power to act 
concurrently on matters within the area of delegated 
authority except in so far as it may already have become 
bound by an act of its delegate. (See Battelley v. 
Finsbury Borough Council (1958 LGR 165).” 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that 
upon delegation of right of divorce (talaq-e-tafweez), the petitioner 
did not denounce his right to pronounce talaq, and, he was obligated 
to intimate factum of the said pronouncement to the Union Council 
concerned. 

9 
W.P. No.13290 of 2024 
 
 
12. 
As regards the fourth question, this Court cannot lose sight of 
the fact that in terms of Section 56 of the Specific Relief Act, 1887, 
an injunction cannot be granted to interfere with the public duties of 
any department of the Federal Government or any Provincial 
Government; or with the sovereign acts of Foreign Government. In 
present case official respondents No.4 and 5 i.e., Administrator 
Union Council and Secretary, Union Council are under obligation in 
terms of the provision of the Ordinance, 1961 that upon receipt of a 
notice from husband regarding the pronouncement of talaq, 
necessary reconciliation proceedings should be initiated and in case 
of failure, certificate of effectiveness of divorce is issued to avoid 
any legal complication (for the parties qua their marital status). The 
said legal position gets further traction from Section 22 of the Act, 
1964 in terms whereof even the Family Court, which is vested with 
exclusive jurisdiction in respect of all the matters relating to 
marriages, enforcement of rights under the nikahnama etc., cannot 
issue an injunctive order. Section 22 reads as under:  
“22. Bar on the issue of injunctions by Family 
Court.- A Family Court shall not have the power 
to issue an injunction to, or stay any proceedings 
pending before, a Chairman or an Arbitration 
Council.” 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that the 
impugned orders are not sustainable.  
13. 
Much emphasis has been laid on the fact that the respondent 
wants to reconcile the matter and it is first wife of the petitioner, 
who is adamant to ruin the marriage of the petitioner with the 
respondent and is not allowing the reconciliation process. In this 
regard, Ayat No.35 of Sura Nisa contemplates as under: 
“If ye fear a breach between them twain, appoint 
(two) arbiters, one from his family and the other 
from hers; if they wish for peace, Allah will 

10 
W.P. No.13290 of 2024 
 
 
cause their reconciliation: For Allah hath full 
knowledge, and is acquainted with all things.” 
It is for the purpose of initiating and effecting reconciliation that in 
terms of Section 7 of the Ordinance, the husband is obligated to 
intimate the Union Council concerned about the pronouncement of 
talaq in any form whatsoever, which the petitioner has done. The 
parties, through elders of the families can always participate in the 
said reconciliation proceedings. It is the respondent herself who, 
instead of appointing an arbiter, is seeking a restraining order 
against the Union Council concerned from a Court of law that has 
no jurisdiction. Her bonafides to have reconciliation with the 
petitioner is casted with doubt when it has been brought to the 
notice of this Court that after filing of suit for declaration alongwith 
permanent injunction, from which the present proceedings have 
emanated, the respondent, on 15.10.2024, has instituted another suit 
on the same subject and substantially with the same prayer, without 
disclosing filing of the earlier suit. Copy of certified copy of the 
second suit has been submitted to this Court with the permission 
and is taken on record as Mark-A. When confronted, learned 
counsel for the respondent had no clue and could not refute the 
judicial record produced before this Court.  
14. In view of above discussion, the present petition is allowed, 
and the impugned orders of the learned Courts below are set aside.
