Raheel Kamran J:- Through this appeal under Section 33 
of the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005, the appellants have 
assailed vires of the judgment dated 30.03.2023 passed by the 
District Consumer Court, Sialkot whereby they were directed to 
return the booking price of the parcel and were also burdened to 
pay a sum of Rs.150,000/- as damages within a period of one 
month.  
2.  
Brief facts of the case are that the respondent was a 
government school teacher who, in order to get her transfer at a 
place nearest to her residence, approached the Education 
Department, Sialkot through an application for which purpose the 
original educational certificates were required to be attested by the 
Higher Education Commission (HEC).  The respondent hired 
services of the appellants in order to dispatch her educational 
certificates to the HEC for their verification. On 30.05.02022, the 
respondent got booked a parcel with the appellants containing 
original certificates/degrees with transcript of BS in Botany

F.A.O. No.39719 of 2023. 
through parcel tracking No.1466477481. The appellants assured 
delivery of such shipment within a period of 2 to 3 days. Although 
the said shipment was delivered but surprisingly the documents 
were not found therein, which were alleged to have been lost in 
between the transit, therefore, the appellants moved an application 
to the concerned police station qua loss of the documents. The 
respondent filed a claim under Section 25 of the Punjab Consumer 
Protection Act, 2005 („Act‟) which was allowed by the trial court 
with the direction to the appellants to return the booking price of 
the parcel amounting to Rs.121/- and pay a sum of Rs.150,000/- as 
damages, hence this appeal.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellants contends that claim of 
the respondent before the District Consumer Court was barred by 
limitation. While elaborating this plea, he has pointed out that the 
respondent admittedly acquired knowledge of the defective 
service on 13.06.2022 when her parcel was received back from the 
Higher Education Commission with the noting that “original are 
missing”. He adds that the legal notice under Section 28(1) of the 
Act in the name of service provider is a mandatory requirement of 
law, however, the same has not been satisfied in this case. He 
further contends that as per legislative scheme envisaged under 
Section 28 of the Act, when the consumer acquires knowledge of 
the defect or fault in the service, limitation period of 30 days 
provided under Section 28(4) of the Act starts to run. It is during 
this period that the consumer has to first put his grievance before 
the service provider for rectification of the defect and provide 
fifteen days to the service provider to redress his grievance as 
required under Section 28(2) of the Act and if the service provider 
fails to respond within the stipulated fifteen days then the 
consumer can file a claim before the District Consumer Court. In 
support of his contention, he has relied upon judgment of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Messrs Pak Suzuki

F.A.O. No.39719 of 2023. 
Motors Company Limited through Manager v. Faisal Jameel Butt 
and another (PLD 2023 SC 482).  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has 
supported the impugned decision while contending that the 
objections with regard to limitation and maintainability of the 
claim has been reasonably addressed by the District Consumer 
Court as manifest from the impugned decision. He maintains that 
the cause of action in this case accrued on 21.07.2022, which is 
the date of knowledge qua loss of documents, the respondent sent 
legal notice to the petitioners on 03.08.2022 within the stipulated 
period of 15 days as mentioned in Section 28(2)(3) of the Act and 
that the claim has been filed within the period prescribed under 
Section 28(4) of the Act. .   
5. 
Heard. Available record perused. 
6. 
The primary question raised for adjudication in this appeal 
is whether claim of the respondent was barred by limitation as 
provided in Section 28(4) of the Act, therefore, the same was 
liable to be rejected?  
7. 
Section 28 of the Act reads as follows:- 
28. 
Settlement of Claims.– (1) A consumer who has 
suffered damage, or Authority in other cases, shall, by written 
notice, call upon a manufacturer or provider of services that a 
product or service is defective or faulty, or the conduct of the 
manufacturer or service provider is in contravention of the 
provisions of this Act and he should remedy the defects or give 
damages where the consumer has suffered damage, or cease to 
contravene the provisions of this Act. 
(2)   
The manufacturer or service provider shall, 
within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice, reply thereto. 
(3)   
No claim shall be entertained by a Consumer 
Court unless the consumer or the Authority has given notice 
under sub-section (1) and provides proof that the notice was 
duly delivered but the manufacturer or service provider has not 
responded thereto. 
(4)   
A claim by the consumer or the Authority shall 
be filed within thirty days of the arising of the cause of action: 
Provided that the Consumer Court, having jurisdiction to 
hear the claim, may allow a claim to be filed after thirty days 
within such time as it may allow if it is satisfied that there was 
sufficient cause for not filing the complaint within the specified 
period: 
Provided further that such extension shall not be 
allowed beyond a period of sixty days from the expiry of the 

4 
F.A.O. No.39719 of 2023. 
warranty or guarantee period specified by the manufacturer or 
service provider and if no period is specified one year from the 
date of purchase of the products or providing of services. 
 
8. 
Section 28 ibid has been subject matter of interpretation 
before the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Messr Pak 
Suzuki Motors Company Limited v. Faisal Jameel Butt (PLD 2023 
SC 482) wherein it has been, inter alia, held that legal notice 
under Section 28(1) of the Act is a mandatory requirement of law 
to grant both the consumer and the manufacturer or service 
provider to address the defects or faults in the product or service 
before the matter proceeds to litigation. It has been further held 
therein that even though no limitation period is provided for 
issuance of a legal notice under Section 28(1) of the Act, it is 
apparent that Section 28(4) of the Act in unequivocal terms 
stipulates and clarifies that a claim with regard to a defective or 
faulty product or service, or contravention of the provisions of the 
Act by the manufacturer or service provider has to be filed within 
30 days of arising of the cause of action which, in such 
circumstances where a product or service is faulty, therefore, 
arises the moment the consumer obtains knowledge that the 
product or service is defective or faulty.  
It has been further held in the aforementioned judgment that 
the legislative intent behind sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of 
Section 28 of the Act is to grant rights to both the consumer and 
the manufacturer or service provider to address the defects or 
faults in the product or service before the matter proceeds to the 
litigation. It ensures that the consumer firstly brings the issue to 
the attention of the manufacturer or the service provider through a 
written notice, so that the defect or fault is rectified and it fulfills 
its obligation to the consumer before the consumer has to file a 
claim before the District Consumer Court, so that there is a 
possibility of settling the claim of the consumer without the need 
to initiate litigation, which would be more cumbersome for a 

5 
F.A.O. No.39719 of 2023. 
simple consumer. At the same time, it also affords the 
manufacturer or the service provider the right to respond to the 
notice within a specified timeframe, enabling it to address any 
legitimate concerns, protect its reputation and mitigate potential 
costs that may be incurred under the Act. In effect, it provides for 
a mechanism to settle the dispute before initiation of litigation and 
the same cannot be construed as giving a fresh cause of action 
wherefrom the 30-day limitation provided under Section 28(4) 
would commence. Therefore, when the consumer obtains 
knowledge of the defect or fault in the product or the service, the 
30-day limitation period stipulated under Section 28(4) of the Act 
commences. It is during this period that the consumer has to first 
put his grievance before the manufacturer or service provider, 
seeking rectification of the defect or fault in the product or 
service, or damages, and provide 15 days to the manufacturer or 
service provider to remedy the same, as required under Section 
28(2). It is only after the manufacturer or the service provider 
responds to the written notice, or where he fails to respond within 
the stipulated 15-days period, that the consumer can file a claim 
before the Consumer Court if the cause of action still subsists. The 
consumer can still file a claim before the District Consumer Court 
by giving sufficient cause for filing the claim beyond 30 days 
which is to be examined by the District Consumer Court, as per 
the provisos to Section 28(4) of the Act. 
9. 
It is manifest from plain reading of sub-section (4) of 
Section 28 of the Act that for it to be adjudicated, a claim should 
be filed within 30 days of arising of the cause of action.  That 
means, for the purpose of limitation under Section 28(4) of the 
Act, the knowledge attributed to a claimant alleging defective 
service must be sufficient and complete enough to constitute 
accrual of cause of action, which has been defined to mean every 
fact which will be necessary for a claimant to prove, if traversed, 
in order to support his or her right to judgment.  Reliance in this 

6 
F.A.O. No.39719 of 2023. 
regard is placed on judgment of the Privy Council in the case of 
Muhammad Khalil Khan and others v. Mahbub Ali Mian (PLD 
1948 Privy Council 131).  Incomplete knowledge of facts 
regarding defective service could hardly provide basis for 
constituting cause of action and running of limitation under 
Section 28(4) of the Act.             
10. 
In this case, cause of action was claimed to have accrued to 
the respondent on 21.07.2022 when the appellants informed the 
respondent that her documents had been lost and Rapt in that 
regard was got incorporated.  The appellants/defendants in para 
No.5 of their written reply admitted to have informed the 
applicant/respondent regarding loss of the documents, however, 
did not mention the date on which it was done.  The dates of 
15.07.2022 and 21.07.2022, as mentioned in para No.3 of the 
statement of claim, have not been controverted by the appellants 
in their reply. Even the representative of TCS while appearing in 
the witness box as RW-1 did not state anything about the date on 
which information qua loss of documents was passed on to the 
respondent.  However, the appellants/defendants for the first time 
in the appeal have taken the plea that the respondent had acquired 
the knowledge on 13.06.2022 when the parcel was received back, 
which is untenable.  Even otherwise, on 13.06.2022 when the 
parcel had received back it was not clear who was at fault i.e. TCS 
or HEC.  The legal notice, as per evidence produced by the 
respondent, was issued to the appellants on 03.08.2022 and if the 
period of thirty days is considered from 21.07.2022, the date of 
accrual of cause of action, then the claim was to be filed on or 
before 20.08.2022 and the same was filed on 18.08.2022, 
therefore, plea of the appellants that claim of the respondent is 
barred by limitation is misconceived.      
11. 
As regards plea of the appellants that requirement of 
Section 28(1) of the Act has not been fulfilled, suffice it to say 
that the same is also misconceived inasmuch as the copy of notice 

7 
F.A.O. No.39719 of 2023. 
under Section 28(1) of the Act is available with file as Ex.P10 to 
Ex.P11/1 and during the evidence Muhammad Rashid, Record 
Keeper, GPO Sialkot was produced as PW-2 who deposed that 
receipts Ex.P2 and Ex.P2/1 were delivered from the Post Office 
and Ex.P3 and Ex.P4 were receipts regarding delivery of the 
parcels.  PW-2 was not cross-examined and even no objection 
over authenticity of the aforementioned receipts has been raised 
by the appellants‟ counsel.  Therefore, the respondent successfully 
established that the legal notice was issued and delivered to the 
appellants-company.  
12. 
Insofar as claim of the respondent is concerned, admittedly 
the appellants-company itself lodged a complaint before the SHO 
Police Station Civil Lines, Sialkot (Ex.P1/1) that the parcel of the 
respondent containing original degree and transcript was being 
transmitted which had lost and Nadeem Ahmad Chughtai, 
Assistant Operation Manager, TCS (RW-1) during cross-
examination admitted it correct that documents of claimant were 
lost during the possession of TCS.  Even in the written reply to the 
application under Sections 25 & 28(4) of the Act, the appellants 
had offered that they were ready to pay expenses to be incurred 
upon reparation of degree of the respondent.  In these 
circumstances, the respondent successfully proved his claim 
before the District Consumer Court. 
13. 
As regards plea of the appellants that no loss has been 
caused to the respondent for the reason that duplicates have been 
issued to her and no specific loss in that head has been claimed, 
suffice it to state that against total claim of over four million 
rupees, the general damages of Rs.150,000/- have been awarded to 
the respondent under the rule of thumb which cannot be termed as 
arbitrary or unreasonable to compensate for the harm or mental 
agonies suffered by the respondent owing to defective quality of 
service provided by the appellant in this case. Reliance in this 
regard is placed on the case of TCS (Private) Limited v. Mst. 

8 
F.A.O. No.39719 of 2023. 
Haseena Begum (PLD 2022 Lahore 524). Therefore, findings of 
the District Consumer Court are unexceptionable. 
14. 
For the foregoing reasons, this Court finds no illegality or 
material irregularity in the impugned judgment warranting 
interference in exercise of appellate jurisdiction.  This appeal, 
being devoid of any merit, is accordingly dismissed.
