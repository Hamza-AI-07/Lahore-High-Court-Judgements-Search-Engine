2. 
After hearing learned counsel for the parties, learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General and going through the available record with their able 
assistance, it has been noticed that briefly, as per Crime Report (FIR) got 
recorded 
by 
Sharafat 
Ali 
(complainant), 
Muhammad 
Rafique                       
(now petitioner in Crl. Misc. No.62505-B/2024) armed with pistol  while 
making firing raised lalkara, Arbab gave blow with butt of pistol at 
forehead of Muhammad Usman (son of the complainant, now deceased of 
the case), then Muhammad Rafique armed with pistol .9mm  gave butt 
blow of pistol at nose of Muhammad Usman, Zulqarnain (now petitioner in 
Crl. Misc. No.43092-B/2024) gave blow with butt of pistol at forehead of 
Muhammad Usman; meanwhile Muzammil Hussain fired shot with pistol 
.30-bore which hit at front of chest of Muhammad Usman at left side and 
went through and through who fell on the ground; accused persons fled 
away while  issuing threats and making firing. 

Crl. Misc. No.43092-B/2024 &

Crl. Misc. No.62505-B/2024 
 
 
So, as per crime report (FIR), Muhammad Rafique was armed with 
pistol, he fired shot, raised lalkara and also gave blow with butt of pistol at 
nose of Muhammad Usman (now deceased of the case) whereas Zulqarnain 
gave blow with butt of pistol at forehead of Muhammad Usman, however, 
on Court’s query, learned Deputy Prosecutor General under instructions of 
police official (present in Court) and after himself going through the 
available record apprises that second investigation of the case was entrusted 
to Deputy Superintendent of Police, Headquarters, Police Line Faisalabad, 
who after thorough investigation vide case diary No. 50 dated: 07.10.2024 
concluded that Muzammil Hussain (co-accused) made firing and fired 
straight shot at Muhammad Usman, which hit at front chest and went 
through and through, who (Muhammad Usman) after receiving said fire 
shot ran a little towards his house but after covering short distance fell at 
metalled road on his face ( ہنم ےک بل ہتخپ ڑسک رپ رگا), due to which he received injuries 
at his mouth, forehead and nose (   ش ان ات ڑپئگ
سج ےس ہنم، پ ی ششااین، ن اک رپ وگلینں ن) and it was not 
mentioned therein that Muhammad Rafique or Zulqarnain caused injuries 
to Muhammad Usman by giving blows with butt of pistol. This is not out of 
place to mention here that as per postmortem examination report of the 
deceased, injury on Nasal Bridge is “Abrasion 1x1cm” whereas at forehead 
above left eye brow is also “Abrasion 3x1cm”, which are not cause of 
death. It has been also noticed that as per crime report (FIR), Arbab               
(co-accused) was also ascribed the role of giving blow with butt of pistol at 
forehead of Muhammad Usman; meaning thereby that as per FIR, two 
blows were given at the forehead of Muhammad Usman i.e. one by Arbab 
and other by Zulqarnain however as per copy of postmortem examination 
report (available on the record), there is only one injury at forehead of 
Muhammad Usman (deceased of the case) as mentioned above. Learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General further apprises that subsequently complainant 
got recorded his supplementary statement while mentioning therein that 
Arbab gave blow with butt of pistol at left knee of Muhammad Usman 
(now deceased of the case). Though as per FIR Muhamad Rafique also 
made firing yet any empty of .9mm pistol was not found at the place of 
occurrence by the Investigating Officer; allegation of raising lalkara has 
been levelled against Muhammad Rafique however it is relevant to mention 

Crl. Misc. No.43092-B/2024 &  
 
3 
Crl. Misc. No.62505-B/2024 
 
here that when as per own case of prosecution, Muhammad Rafique was 
himself armed with .9mm pistol and also made firing, then what was the 
hindrance in his way to fire shot straight at Muhammad Usman and himself 
kill him, is a mystery/question mark and in said state of affairs, whether 
lalkara allegedly raised by Muhammad Rafique was  “commanding” or 
mere “proverbial” in nature would be determined during trial of the case. 
It has also been apprised by learned Deputy Prosecutor General that after 
thorough investigation carried out by Deputy Superintendent of Police, 
Headquarters, Police Line Faisalabad, it has been concluded by him that 
Zulqarnain was neither equipped with any weapon nor caused any injury 
to deceased or anybody else in the case rather he was present at the place 
of occurrence empty handed and did not perform any role in the 
occurrence. Since any empty of .9mm pistol was not found at the spot 
and any report regarding matching of any empty of .30-bore pistol 
secured from the spot with pistol allegedly recovered from Zulqarnain is 
not available on the record as apprised by learned Deputy Prosecutor 
General therefore evidentiary value of recovery of pistol .9mm from 
Muhammad Rafique and pistol .30-bore from Zulqarnain would also be 
determined during trial. Aforementioned supplementary statement of 
complainant also requires evidential verification during trial. It is also 
relevant to mention here that Arbab (co-accused, mentioned above) has 
already been granted post arrest bail in the case vide order dated: 
09.07.2024 (copy available on the record) passed by learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Faisalabad, which order is still holding the field and has 
neither been challenged by the prosecution nor by the State as confirmed 
by learned Deputy Prosecutor General as well as by learned counsel for 
the complainant. When all aforementioned factors are taken into 
consideration in totality, then question of sharing common intention as 
well as vicarious liability to the extent of present petitioners i.e. 
Muhammad Rafique and Zulqarnain would be seen during trial of the 
case, however, case of prosecution, at present, against both petitioners 
requires further probe/inquiry within the purview of sub-section 2 of 
Section: 497 Cr.P.C. Both petitioners were arrested in the case on 
12.04.2024, sent to jail on 25.04.2024 where they are confined till now. 
Mere detention of the petitioners in lock-up, in aforementioned 

Crl. Misc. No.43092-B/2024 &  
 
4 
Crl. Misc. No.62505-B/2024 
 
circumstances, would serve no useful purpose to the case of prosecution. 
Bail cannot be withheld as advance punishment.  
 
Liberty of a person is a precious right which has been guaranteed by 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. By now it is also 
well settled that it is better to err in granting bail than to err in refusal 
because ultimate conviction and sentence can repair the wrong resulted by a 
mistaken relief of bail; in this regard, case of “CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL 
ACCOUNTABILITY BUREAU through P.G., NAB versus NISAR 
AHMED PATHAN and others” (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 475) can be 
advantageously referred and its relevant portion from Page No(s).480-481 
is reproduced: - 
“To err in granting bail is better than to err in declining; for 
the ultimate conviction and sentence of a guilty person can 
repair the wrong caused by a mistaken relief of bail, but no 
satisfactory reparation can be offered to an innocent person on 
his acquittal for his unjustified imprisonment during the trial.” 
 
3.  
In view of above, both petitions for grant of post arrest bail bearing 
Crl. Misc. No.43092-B/2024 filed by Zulqarnain (petitioner) and Crl. Misc. 
No.62505-B/2024 
filed 
by 
Muhammad 
Rafique 
(petitioner) 
are 
accepted/allowed and they are admitted to bail in the case subject to their 
furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees five hundred 
thousand only) each with two sureties each in the like amount to the 
satisfaction of trial court.  
4. 
It goes without saying that observations mentioned above are just 
tentative in nature, strictly confined to the disposal of instant bail petitions 
and will have no bearing upon trial of the case, which would be concluded 
by the trial court expeditiously and preferably within a period of four 
months after receipt of attested copy of this order. Needless to add that if 
petitioners or anybody else acting on their behalf will create any hurdle in 
the way of conclusion of trial as directed above, then complainant as well 
as State would be at liberty to move for recalling of this order.
