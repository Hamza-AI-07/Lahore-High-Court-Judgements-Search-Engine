MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- 
Through instant petition, petitioner (Sirdar Muhammad Umer 
Khan Khosa) has assailed order dated 21.03.2024, passed by the 
Returning Officer and judgment dated 27.03.2024, passed by 
learned Election Tribunal, respectively, whereby his nomination 
papers for the constituency PP-290, D.G. Khan-V were rejected 
on the grounds of non-submission of requisite NOCs and 
attachment of transcript of petitioner’s brother, concurrently.  
2. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that the Returning 
Officer is empowered to ask for requisite NOCs from concerned 
departments even if the same are not attached with the 
nomination papers but the needful was not done. He adds that 
petitioner furnished the NOCs before the date of scrutiny of the 
nominations papers, however the same were discarded without 
any lawful justification. He alleges that transcript of petitioner’s 

 
W. P. No.4216 of 2024 
2
brother was detached from the nomination papers of his brother 
and included in the nomination papers of petitioner making a 
ground for rejection of nomination papers mala fidely, however 
argues that petitioner’s nomination papers were liable to be 
accepted even without the transcript of his brother as academic 
qualification of LLM was not a condition precedent for a 
candidate to contest the general elections. He contends that even 
otherwise, petitioner is a law graduate and holding a degree of 
LLM, which was attached with his nomination papers. He 
contends that even no opportunity was provided to petitioner to 
explain his position and cure the bona fide mistake, if any. He 
finally submits that relevant provisions of the Elections Act, 
2017 have been misconstrued while passing the impugned 
decisions, which are unsustainable in the eye of law. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for Election Commission of 
Pakistan and learned Assistant Attorney General, who argued 
W.P.No.4005 of 2024 fixed today, have shown their willingness 
to advance arguments in this case. They defended the impugned 
decisions by submitting that it was a case of non-fulfillment of 
pre-requisites while filing nomination papers,  thus, the same 
were rightly rejected within the contemplation of section 
62(9)(c) of the Elections Act, 2017.  
  
Admittedly, respondents No.3 & 7 did not raise any 
objections before the Returning Officer against nomination 
papers of petitioner, however they have tendered appearance 
today, on watching brief, and contested W.P.No.4005 of 2024 
fixed today, therefore, they are allowed to argue the matter. 
Learned counsel for respondents No.3 & 7 have supported the 
stance of learned counsel for Election Commission of Pakistan. 
The remaining private respondents were not in attendance in 
W.P.No.4005 of 2024 fixed today despite notice and proceeded 
against ex parte, therefore, we are not inclined to issue notice to 
them in this case, which is being decided in their absence after 

 
W. P. No.4216 of 2024 
3
hearing arguments of parties who entered appearance in this 
case. 
4. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
5. 
The grounds prevailed upon the Returning Officer to 
reject petitioner’s nomination papers, concurred by learned 
Election Tribunal, are non-provision of requisite NOCs from 
MEPCO, PTCL, Municipal Committee and SNGPL and 
attachment of transcript of petitioner’s brother. The available 
record 
reflects 
that 
NOCs 
from 
MEPCO, 
Municipal 
Corporation, Dera Ghazi Khan and PTCL are dated 20.03.2024 
and clearance letter / certificate from SNGPL, signed by 
Muhammad Jamil Rasheed, Dy. Chief Engineer, is dated 
02.01.2024, however signatures of Abdul Rasheed Janjua, 
Billing Officer are dated 18.03.2024. It is manifestly clear from 
the tenor of the said NOCs that no liability was existing against 
petitioner. Petitioner has claimed that these NOCs were 
presented before the Returning Officer before expiry of the 
scheduled date and time for scrutiny of nomination papers and 
this fact has not been negated by the other side before us. In this 
scenario, the omission to tender the said requisite NOCs while 
filing nomination papers is not a lapse / defect of such a grave 
nature which may invite extreme measure of rejection of the 
nomination papers. This lapse could have been fatal if it was the 
omission was designed to avoid the liability or intended to 
conceal some unlawful activity. In this backdrop, the impugned 
decisions are not legally sustainable. Reference can be made to 
Malik Shakeel Awan v. Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed and 21 others 
(PLD 2018 Supreme Court 643), Khawaja Muhammad Asif v. 
Muhammad Usman Dar and others (2018 SCMR 2128), Nida 
Khuhro v. Moazzam Ali Khan and others (2019 SCMR 
1684), Shamona Badshah Qaisarani v. Election Tribunal, 
Multan and others (2021 SCMR 988) and Amir Raza and 
another v. Provincial Election Commission through DEO and 5 
others (2016 YLR 431).

6. 
Petitioner has seriously disputed the fact of attachment of 
transcript of LLM of petitioner’s brother with his nomination 
papers, and this denial coupled with allegation of some sort of 
mala fide act on the part of the Returning Officer raises a 
factual dispute, which we are not inclined to dilate upon. 
However, we are persuaded that petitioner’s transcript of LLM 
was not required to be filed along with the nomination papers. 
We are also of candid opinion that the alleged mistake of filing 
transcript of petitioner’s brother is not a defect of such a nature 
which may attract any express provision qua disqualification or 
rejection of nomination papers provided in the Elections Act, 
2017.  
7. 
The available record further shows that neither any 
specific direction was issued by the Returning Officer nor a fair 
opportunity was provided to petitioner to cure the said defects / 
lapses, which is not a proper exercise of jurisdiction. This 
material aspect of the matter also escaped the notice of learned 
Election Tribunal.  
8. 
Needless to say that right to contest election is a 
fundamental right guaranteed by Article 17(2) of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, and 
the provisions in the Elections Act, 2017 that curtail or in any 
manner affect this right are to be construed strictly and 
applied restrictively, especially when the defect is not of 
substantial nature and can be remedied. Steering thought can 
be gathered from latest decisions of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan vide order dated 29.01.2024, passed in Civil Petition 
No.150 & 152 of 2024 titled Tahir Sadiq v. Faisal Ali, etc. 
and order dated 26.01.2024, passed in Civil Petition No.181 
of 2024 titled Pervez Elahi v. Election Commission of 
Pakistan, etc. Some of the observations in the case of Tariq 
Sadiq supra are reproduced hereunder:- 
“3.  
It is in this context of both the right of the candidates 
to contest the election and the right of the voters to vote for 

 
W. P. No.4216 of 2024 
5
the candidate of their choice that the qualification and 
disqualification of a candidate become material. The aim of 
prescribing 
qualifications 
and 
disqualifications 
for 
candidacies to contest elections is to maintain the integrity 
and effectiveness of the political process. They are designed 
to ensure that individuals holding public office meet certain 
standards. In a well-functioning democracy, the criteria for 
qualifications and disqualifications are clearly defined, 
publicly known and uniformly applied. Qualifications and 
disqualifications of a candidate for the electoral process 
must therefore be clearly spelled out in the Constitution or 
the law. Otherwise, electoral laws must be interpreted in 
favour of enfranchisement rather than disenfranchisement so 
that maximum choice remains with the voters to elect their 
future leadership. With this approach rooted in the high 
constitutional rights and values, the courts are to deal with 
the matters of acceptance or rejection of the nomination 
papers filed for contesting elections.” 
9. 
In view of the above, instant petition is allowed and 
impugned decisions are set aside being illegal and without lawful 
authority. In consequence, nomination papers of petitioner stand 
accepted, he is allowed to contest the election and participate in 
all the subsequent steps / stages of the announced election 
schedule.
