impugned Judgment & Decree dated 22.10.2016 passed by Additional 
District Judge, Toba Tek Singh, whereby, the Judgment & Decree dated 
08.04.2014 passed by Civil Judge, Toba Tek Singh was reversed.  
2. 
 
Brief facts of this case are that the private Respondents No. 1(i) 
to 1(iii) (the “Respondents”) instituted a suit for declaration against the 
Petitioner contending therein that their predecessor-in-interest, namely, Shah 
Muhammad was owner in possession of the suit property fully described in 
the headnote of the plaint who remained admitted in Allied Hospital, 
Faisalabad as a patient of ‘Cancer’ from 30.07.2005 till 24.08.2005. He was 
discharged on 24.08.2005 and died on the midnight between 25.08.2005 and 
26.08.2005. At the time of his death, he was extremely weak and feeble and 
was not in a position to execute mutation No. 739 dated 23.08.2005 (the 
“impugned mutation”) attested in favour of the Petitioner. As such, the 
impugned mutation was fraudulently attested in connivance with the revenue 

2 
C. R. No. 174 of 2017 
officials. It was also specifically alleged that deceased Shah Muhammad did 
not appear before any Revenue Officer, received any sale consideration or 
delivered possession of the suit property. It was further asserted that in the 
impugned mutation, the date of recording of the sale transaction in 
Roznamcha Waqiati was interpolated from 16.08.2005 to 09.08.2005, 
although deceased Shah Muhammad did not appear, report or record any sale 
transaction on 09.08.2005 or 16.08.2005. Further, another exchange mutation 
No. 738 dated 08.08.2005 (the “exchange mutation”) between deceased 
Shah Muhammad and his real brother was also fraudulently attested 
regarding which the Respondents reserve right to challenge the same. The 
Respondents first challenged the impugned mutation before the revenue 
hierarchy and the same was set aside vide Order dated 13.02.2006. An 
Appeal filed by the Petitioner was dismissed on 12.02.2007. However, the 
Revision of the Petitioner was accepted vide Order dated 19.05.2010 which 
constrained the Respondents to institute the suit for declaration.  
3. 
 
The Petitioner filed contesting written statement with the stance 
that deceased Shah Muhammad was suffering from Cancer and required 
immediate finances for his treatment. At the insistence of the Respondents, 
the Petitioner agreed to purchase the suit property which was transferred 
through the impugned mutation against consideration of Rs. 400,000/-. It was 
specifically stated that deceased Shah Muhammad remained admitted in the 
Allied Hospital from 11.08.2005 to 24.08.2005. He personally appeared 
before the Revenue Officer on 09.08.2005 when all the particulars of sale 
including the factum of payment of sale consideration were incorporated in 
Roznamcha in presence of the witnesses by Halqa Patwari which was also 
verified by the Revenue Officer on that day. The Petitioner was delivered 
possession of the suit property but was later forcibly dispossessed by the 
Respondents. Thus, the oral sale mutation was complete in all respects on 
09.08.2005 and the same was merely sanctioned on 23.08.2005 during visit 
of the Revenue Officer. Another exchange mutation between deceased Shah 
Muhammad and his brother was also attested on 08.08.2005. Hence, the suit 
is ostensibly frivolous which is liable to be dismissed.

4. 
 
The Trial Court framed the following issues arising out of the 
divergent pleadings of the parties:- 
(i) 
Whether the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff namely Shah 
Muhammad due to Cancer disease was incapable of knowing his 
interest and on the crucial day i.e. 23.8.2005 when impugned 
mutation No.739 was sanctioned, he was admitted in Allied 
Hospital Faisalabad so said mutation is liable to be cancelled 
being illegal and result of misrepresentation? OPP 
(ii) 
Whether predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff never received 
any consideration to sanction the impugned mutation No.739 
dated 23.08.2005? OPP 
(iii) 
Whether the order of Board of Revenue dated 19.05.2010 to 
uphold the impugned mutation is illegal and against facts, so 
liable to be cancelled? OPP 
(iv) 
Whether from 30-7-2005 to 24-8-2005, predecessor-in-interest 
of the plaintiffs namely Shah Muhammad was not admitted in 
the hospital but he was admitted on 11.8.2005? OPD 
(v) 
Whether for the treatment of deceased vendor, the deceased 
vendor Nazir Ahmed and plaintiff No.1 requested to sale the suit 
property and defendant after paying this consideration purchased 
the same, thus mutation was rightly sanctioned? OPD 
(vi) 
Relief. 
5. 
 
 The Trial Court recorded respective evidence of the parties and 
proceeded to dismiss the suit of the Respondents. However, Appellate Court 
reversed the decision of Trial Court and decreed the suit of the Respondents. 
Hence, this Civil Revision. 
6. 
 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner contended that deceased Shah 
Muhammad exchanged his land with his brother, Nazeer Ahmad through 
exchange mutation which was attested on the basis of Rapt Roznamcha No. 
578 dated 06.08.2005. After the said exchange, deceased Shah Muhammad 
sold the suit property to the Petitioner for Rs. 400,000/-. The transaction was 
recorded in Rapt Roznamcha No. 583 dated 09.08.2005 (Ex. D-6). The 
receipt of consideration and delivery of possession were also recorded 
therein. The impugned mutation (Ex. P-3) was entered on which AC-II 
recorded statements of the parties in support of the transaction. Attestation of 
the mutation, however, was postponed for deposit of fee which was attested 
on 23.08.2005. The Respondents instituted the suit on 07.05.2007 against 
Nazeer Ahmad, their uncle, to challenge the exchange mutation but later, 

4 
C. R. No. 174 of 2017 
withdrew the same on the basis of compromise on 17.02.2010 which itself 
testifies that the Respondents had filed false suit against the Petitioner. The 
findings of the Board of Revenue are well-reasoned which support the case of 
the Petitioner. It was conclusively established that deceased Shah 
Muhammad was admitted in the hospital on 11.08.2005 and as such, the 
basic version of the Respondents was not proved. This fact also proves that 
the transaction of the impugned mutation was lawfully incorporated in Rapt 
Roznamcha on 09.08.2005 which is admissible per se in the light of law laid 
down in case titled, “Haq Nawaz v. Malik Gul Hussain through Legal Heirs 
and another” (1994 MLD 585) and as such, the attestation of mutation was 
immaterial in view of admission of the transaction recorded therein. Reliance 
was further placed on cases titled, “Haji Ilahi Bakhsh v. Noor Muhammad 
and others” (PLD 1985 Supreme Court 41); and “Muhammad Zaman Khan 
v. The Additional Chief Land Commissioner and another” (1986 SCMR 
1121). He further contended that statement of the deceased vendor was 
recorded in presence of witnesses, Abdul Ghafoor, Pattidar who was son-in-
law of deceased Shah Muhammad and Nazeer Ahmad, his real brother. It was 
admitted that vendor had received consideration and delivered the possession. 
Thus, the transaction was complete in all respects on 09.08.2005 and its 
subsequent attestation on 23.08.2005 becomes immaterial. The deceased had 
received part of the suit property from his brother, Nazeer Ahmad through 
the exchange mutation and thereafter, the suit property was transferred to the 
Petitioner. The witnesses of the impugned mutation could not be produced on 
account of their death but notwithstanding the same, the Petitioner had 
proved the transaction of sale through documentary evidence, particularly, 
Ex.D-6 and Ex.P-3 corroborated by the statements of his witnesses including 
the Patwari who testified the transaction, presence of the deceased vendor, 
receipt of consideration and delivery of possession.  
7. 
 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondents submitted that 
once execution of the impugned mutation and receipt of consideration was 
denied by the Respondents, the onus shifted upon the Petitioner to prove the 
transaction but he did not produce witnesses of the transaction to 
independently prove the same. Recording of the transaction in Roznamcha 

5 
C. R. No. 174 of 2017 
was fraudulently procured which is evident from interpolation in the 
impugned mutation. As such, Roznamcha carried no evidentiary value. 
Reliance was placed on cases titled, “Noor Muhammad v. Abdul Ghani” 
(2002 CLC 88); “Tooti Gul and 2 others v. Irfanuddin” (1996 SCMR 1386); 
“Muhammad Nawaz through L.Rs. v. Haji Muhammad Baran Khan through 
L.Rs. and others” (2013 SCMR 1300); “Saddaruddin (since deceased) 
through LRs. v. Sultan Khan (since deceased) through LRs and others” (2021 
SCMR 642); and “Sheikh Akhtar Aziz v. Mst. Shabnam Begum and others” 
(2019 SCMR 524). Hence, the Judgment of Appellate Court is well-reasoned 
and the same does not warrant any interference by this Court.  
8. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
9. 
 
The entire case of the Petitioner is based upon the recorded sale 
transaction in Roznamcha. Therefore, before scrutinizing evidence, it would 
be beneficial to dilate upon the significance, contours and sanctity of a 
transaction recorded in Roznamcha including its mode of proof and 
evidentiary value. The provisions of Section 42 of the Punjab Land Revenue 
Act, 1967 (the “Act”) (as it existed on the date of the impugned mutation) 
deal with the process of making that part of periodic records which relates to 
land owners. Sub-Section (1) thereof provides that any person acquiring any 
right in an estate as a landowner, or a tenant by inheritance, purchase, 
mortgage, gift or otherwise for a fixed term exceeding one year, shall, within 
three months from the date of such acquisition, report his acquisition of right 
to the Patwari of the estate. The Patwari is required to record such report in 
Roznamcha in the prescribed manner, provide copies thereof to the person 
making the report and send a copy of the report to the office of the concerned 
Union Administration. Reports in Roznamcha are recorded in accordance 
with procedure stipulated in the Punjab Land Revenue Rules, 1968. The 
Patwari in terms of Section 42(3) of the Act is obligated to enter reports 
recorded in Roznamcha in the register of mutations. However, if no such 
report has been made to the Patwari, he is required to himself make an entry 
in Roznamcha and register of mutations respecting the acquisition of any 
such right which he has reason to believe to have taken place. It is also 
necessary for the Patwari to display the report recorded by him in the 

6 
C. R. No. 174 of 2017 
prescribed manner as ordained by Section 42(4) of the Act. If the Patwari 
fails to perform his duty, the Revenue Officer upon the report of the 
concerned person is required to cause such report to be recorded in the 
register of mutations in terms of Section 42(5) of the Act. The Revenue 
Officer is obliged from time to time to inquire into veracity of all entries 
incorporated in the register of mutations including such reports which ought 
to have been recorded by the Patwari and in turn, is competent in each case to 
make such order as he thinks fit with respect to any entry in the periodical 
record of the rights acquired as per the command of Section 42(6) of the Act. 
Importantly, Section 42(7) postulates that except in cases of inheritance or 
where the acquisition of the right is by a registered deed or under an order or 
decree of a Court, the Revenue Officer shall make the order under Section 
42(6) in the presence of the person whose right has been acquired, after such 
person has been identified by two respectable persons, preferably from 
Lambardars or members of the Union Committee, Town Committee or Union 
Council concerned whose signatures or thumb impressions shall be obtained 
by the Revenue Officer on the register of mutations. Further, such inquiry is 
required to be made in the common assembly in the estate to which the 
subject matter mutation relates as required by Section 42(8) of the Act. After 
compliance of the aforesaid procedure, an entry with respect to an order of 
the Revenue Officer made under Section 42(6) of the Act is incorporated in 
the periodical record as ordained by Section 42(9) of the Act through which 
right of the acquirer is recognized by the omission from such record of any 
entry in any record previously prepared, which by reason of the acquisition, 
has ceased to be correct. The Revenue Officer is required within three 
months to make an order under Section 42(6) of the Act after incorporation 
of an entry in Roznamcha or register of mutations, failing which he is 
obligated to report the reason of delay to the Collector in the prescribed 
manner as per the mandate of Section 42(10) of the Act. The Revenue Officer 
is also required to transmit the gist of an order made by him under Section 
42(6) of the Act to the person whose right has been acquired and to the 
concerned Union Administration in the prescribed manner in terms of Section 
42(11) of the Act. 

7 
C. R. No. 174 of 2017 
10. 
 
It follows from the above analysis that Section 42 of the Act has 
prescribed a complete code for transfer of rights of land owners in order to 
ensure transparency and avoid chances of fraud and manipulation. The 
recording of report in Roznamcha regarding change in rights of a land owner 
is a first step to trigger the process of transfer of right. However, mutation is 
sanctioned by an order of the Revenue Officer made in presence of the 
person whose right is acquired once he has been identified by two respectable 
persons and an inquiry in this behalf is conducted in common assembly of the 
concerned estate. Thus, an entry recorded in Roznamcha is merely a 
ministerial act performed by the Patwari which is incorporated in the register 
of mutations culminating into an order of passing of mutation under Section 
42(6) of the Act by the Revenue Officer.              
11. 
 
Therefore, an act of recording of a transaction regarding change 
of rights by the Patwari at the behest of an acquirer in Roznamcha does not 
constitute an admission of the transaction on the part of seller as argued by 
learned counsel of the Petitioner. In Haq Nawaz case (supra), it was held that 
a recorded entry in Roznamcha is a public document and is admissible per se. 
However, in the said case, the vendor had confessed of selling the same 
property to both the contesting parties and while discovering the truth, the 
Court held that in terms of Rule 3.79 and 3.80 of the Land Record Manual, 
Roznamcha was maintained by Patwari in the discharge of his official duties 
and as such, by virtue of Article 85 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
(the “QSO”), it was a public document which was per se admissible. 
However, importantly, the recorded report in Roznamcha therein was not 
alleged to have been fraudulently entered. If the transaction incorporated in 
Roznamcha is under challenge, the presumption attached thereto stands 
rebutted and it is required to be proved as any other private document. 
Similarly, in Haji Ilahi Bakhsh case (supra), the entry of transaction recorded 
in Roznamcha was not disputed and as such, its effect was considered, 
accordingly. Further, in Muhammad Zaman Khan case (supra), entries in 
Roznamcha with respect to gift in favour of minor son were relied upon by 
the Supreme Court as there were no allegations that the said entries were 
forged or manipulated. 

8 
C. R. No. 174 of 2017 
12. 
 
It is now well settled that in case of a challenge to the 
transaction and the mutation, both the transaction and the mutation would be 
required to be independently proved. As the mutation itself is not an 
instrument of title, therefore, a mutation in the light of specific denial by the 
owner does not have probative value as the presumption stands rebutted. 
Similarly, entries recorded in Roznamcha if not proved to have been made at 
the instance of the vendor or to have been signed by him carry no evidentiary 
value. In Tooti Gul case (supra), the transaction was reported to the Patwari 
who entered the same in Roznamcha but the impugned mutation could not be 
sanctioned on account of death of the vendor. In this context, it was held that 
entry of transaction in Roznamcha by itself does not confer title under the law 
and the transactions embodied therein have to be established independently 
of the mutations.  
13. 
 
Various contours of Roznamcha were explicitly explored by the 
Supreme Court in case titled, “Zulfiqar and others v. Shahdat Khan” (PLD 
2007 Supreme Court 582), wherein, it was conclusively settled that 
although Roznamcha maintained by Patwari during the course of 
performance of his official duty is admissible yet if report contains 
particulars of a private transaction, it is required to be independently proved 
and reference to recorded transaction of Roznamcha on the mutation sheet 
did not constitute any evidence of the same. Even the report of Roznamcha 
is required to be proved by producing Roznamcha itself and examination of 
the maker of the report. After analyzing a number of precedents, the Court 
with reference to Haq Nawaz case (supra) observed that no presumption of 
truth was attached to a note contained in Roznamcha unless the maker was 
examined and that to hold that an entry in Roznamcha amounts to a sale will 
be laying down a hazardous proposition of law inasmuch as that fate of land 
holdings will be at the mercy of a Patwari. For further reference, also see 
cases titled, “Khalil Ahmad v. Abdul Jabbar Khan and others” (2005 SCMR 
911); “Mst. Khanai and 4 others v. Ghulam Rasool and 9 others” (2022 
CLC 433); and “Mst. Kaneeza Bibi and 4 others v. Sabir Hussain and 3 
others” (PLD 2023 Lahore 380). Hence, it is explicitly clear that only 

9 
C. R. No. 174 of 2017 
attestation of mutation by a Revenue Officer completes the process of 
transaction of transfer of right initiated by recording an entry in Roznamcha.  
14. 
 
Reverting to the facts of the titled case in the light of evidence 
on record, it transpires that burden to prove the first three issues was placed 
on the shoulders of the Respondents. PW-1 and PW-2 entered into the 
witness box and reiterated contents of the plaint. It was candidly deposed that 
deceased Shah Muhammad was suffering from Cancer and was admitted in 
Allied Hospital on the date of attestation of the impugned mutation. He never 
appeared before any Revenue Officer for attestation of the impugned 
mutation. He did not receive any consideration against the alleged sale or 
delivered possession of the suit property. The witnesses also testified that he 
did not appear and record the sale transaction in Roznamcha. Alleging 
interpolation with respect to the alleged date of recording of transaction in 
Roznamcha, the transaction was dubbed as forged and fabricated. After 
denial of the transaction and impugned mutation in line with the contents of 
the plaint, the initial burden of proof was discharged which shifted to the 
Petitioner. Although the testimony of PW-3, the Record Keeper of Allied 
Hospital read with Ex. D-1, establishes that deceased Shah Muhammad was 
hospitalized due to Cancer from 11.08.2005 to 24.08.2005 as claimed by the 
Petitioner yet he was legally bound to prove the transaction and due 
attestation of the impugned mutation. Nazeer Ahmad, brother of deceased 
Shah Muhammad and one Abdul Ghafoor are the stated witnesses of the 
impugned mutation but the Petitioner did not produce any of them. There is 
nothing on record to suggest that they had died and in that case, the Petitioner 
did not comply with the procedure encapsulated in the QSO. A new case was 
set up by DW-3 & DW-4 during evidence by claiming that the sale 
transaction was agreed on 02.08.2005 when part consideration of Rs. 
100,000/- was paid followed by remaining payment of Rs. 300,000/- on 
09.08.2005. It is settled law that a party cannot tender evidence beyond its 
pleadings. Even otherwise, both the witnesses admitted that payment of 
consideration was without receipt. Admittedly, the impugned mutation was 
attested on 23.08.2005 when deceased Shah Muhammad was in Hospital. It 
was also conceded that at the time of attestation of impugned mutation on 

10 
C. R. No. 174 of 2017 
23.08.2005, deceased Shah Muhammad and the Vendee did not personally 
appear before the Revenue Officer. DW-1, Abdul Haq Abid, Patwari 
admitted that Roznamcha and the impugned mutation were not entered by 
him. DW-2, Muhammad Riaz, Patwari testified the veracity of the fact of 
recording of transaction in Roznamcha on 09.08.2005 but in his cross-
examination, he candidly admitted that he did not obtain signatures and 
thumb impressions of the seller and the witnesses and sale consideration did 
not pass before him although the same was acknowledged by the seller. He 
also acknowledged that he substituted 16.08.2005 to 09.08.2005 by cutting in 
the impugned mutation in order to bring it in conformity with the date of 
Roznamcha and he did not affix his signatures thereon. Importantly, he stated 
that recorded particulars of the transaction in Roznamcha were incorporated 
in the impugned mutation which was presented before the Revenue Officer 
and the same was attested on 23.08.2005. The Petitioner also did not produce 
any Revenue Officer. Hence, it was unequivocally established that the 
impugned mutation was unlawfully attested on 23.08.2005 when deceased 
Shah Muhammad was admitted in Hospital. Therefore, even if the 
Petitioner’s contention that transaction of sale was validly recorded in 
Roznamcha on 09.08.2005 is taken on its face value yet it is of no help to the 
Petitioner to advance his cause. Moreover, the mere fact that an exchange 
mutation was attested on 08.08.2005 between deceased Shah Muhammad and 
his brother does not absolve the Petitioner to independently prove his case. 
This is especially so when the suit instituted by the Respondents against their 
uncle was withdrawn on the basis of compromise, the terms of which are not 
known. Therefore, it is vividly obvious that the Petitioner failed to discharge 
the burden of proof regarding the alleged transaction in terms of personal 
appearance of deceased Shah Muhammad and witnesses before the Revenue 
Officer; payment of sale consideration; delivery of possession; subsequent 
dispossession; recording of transaction in Roznamcha; and lawful attestation 
of the impugned mutation.  
15. 
 
It, therefore, follows that Appellate Court rendered a well-
reasoned and sound judgment after due appraisal of evidence which is 
unexceptional and requires no interference by this Court in exercise of 

11 
C. R. No. 174 of 2017 
revisional jurisdiction of this Court. Accordingly, this Civil Revision being 
devoid of any merit is dismissed. No order as to costs.
