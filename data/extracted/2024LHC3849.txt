Date of hearing:     04.09.2024 
Petitioners by: 
Syed Kazim Raza Naqvi, Advocate.

General. 
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.: Through 
instant revision petition, petitioners have challenged judgment and 
decree dated 10.02.2015, passed by learned Additional District 
Judge, whereby appeal against judgment and decree dated 
02.07.2012, passed by learned Civil Judge, Chakwal, was accepted 
and petitioners’ suit was dismissed.  
 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that petitioners filed a suit for 
declaration, cancellation of mutation No.387 dated 25.05.2001 
(regarding land measuring 11 kanals 17 marlas, situated in Khewat 
Nos.108, 222, 613 & 607 in Mauza Dhoke Bodlay Shah, Tehsil & 
District, Chakwal) and possession along with mandatory injunction 
against respondents alleging therein that their deceased father Syed 
Munir Hussain Shah (died on 23.03.2009) was owner in possession  
of suit land; that the deceased executed a general power of attorney 
in favour of respondent No.1 / her daughter on 01.08.1997, which 
was later on duly cancelled by the deceased on 28.04.2001; that 
respondent No.1 was well aware of the cancellation of general 
power of attorney, however she transferred the suit land in favour 

 
Civil Revision No.314-D of 2015

of her husband / respondent No.2 on 25.05.2001, with the 
connivance of official respondents; that petitioners came to know 
about said fraudulent transaction after death of their father, about 
two weeks prior to institution of the suit.  Respondents contested 
the suit by filing written statement. Learned Trial Court, after 
framing issues, recording evidence and hearing arguments from 
both sides decreed the suit vide judgment and decree dated 
02.07.2012. Feeling aggrieved, respondents filed appeal before 
learned Additional District Judge, which was accepted, judgment 
and decree of learned Trial Court was set aside and suit of 
petitioners was dismissed, vide judgment and decree dated 
10.02.2015. Hence, instant revision petition.  
 
3. 
Learned counsel submits that it was obligatory upon the 
attorney to seek specific written permission from the principal 
before transferring the property to close blood relation / spouse but 
no such recourse was adopted by respondent No.1. He adds that 
learned Appellate Court has not appreciated the evidence in totality 
rather picked certain portions of the statements. He further submits 
that impugned transfer reflected consideration as Rs.240,000/- 
whereas the alleged loan amount, mentioned in the suit, was 
Rs.300,000/-, and there is no mention of the differential amount, 
hence the story narrated by respondent No.1 is false and frivolous. 
He contends that in presence of registered revocation / cancellation 
of general power of attorney, the impugned mutation is nullity in 
the eye of law. He has relied upon Fida Muhammad v. Pir 
Muhammad Khan (Deceased) through legal heirs and others (PLD 
1985 Supreme Court 341), Mst. Shumal Begum v. Mst. Gulzar 
Begum and 3 others (1994 SCMR 818), Haji Faqir Muhammad 
and others v. Pir Muhammad and another (1997 SCMR 1811), 
Muhammad Yasin and another v. Dost Muhammad through Legal 
Heirs and another (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 71), Mst. Ghulam 
Fatima v. Muhammad Din and others (2004 SCMR 618), Ghulam 
Muhammad v. Zohran Bibi and others (2021 SCMR 19), Atta

Muhammad and others v. Mst. Munir Sultan (Deceased) through 
her LRs and others (2021 SCMR 73), Mst. Akhtar Sultana v. Major 
Retd. Muzaffar Khan Malik through his legal heirs and others 
(PLD 2021 Supreme Court 715). 
 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondents submits that 
petitioners have failed to prove that due intimation qua cancellation 
of general power of attorney was given to respondent No.1 / 
attorney. He adds that even if the impugned mutation is invalid, the 
property in question, at the most, can be restored in favour of 
respondent No.1, not the principal. He further submits that the 
principal as well as petitioners did not challenge the impugned 
mutation for a long period of 08-years and there is no plausible 
justification for the said long delay. He contends that even 
otherwise no justification for cancellation of general power of 
attorney was given. He argues that PW-2, during cross-
examination, categorically admitted that impugned mutation was in 
the knowledge of predecessor of petitioners and petitioners also 
came to know about impugned mutation dated 25.05.2001 
immediately. He further submits that petitioners failed to prove the 
fact that due intimation was given to respondent No.1 qua 
cancellation of general power of attorney. He has relied upon Raza 
Munir and another v. Mst. Sardar Bibi and 3 others (2005 SCMR 
1315) and Jamila Khatoon and others v. Aish Muhammad and 
others (2011 SCMR 222).

Heard. Available record perused. 
 
5. 
Execution of valid general power of attorney dated 
01.08.1997 (Ex.P-3) in favour of respondent No.1 by the 
predecessor / father of petitioners & respondent No.1 is admitted, 
however its revocation (through Ex.P-2 dated 28.04.2001) is 
disputed by respondent No.1 and execution of mutation No.387 by 
respondent No.1 in favour of respondent No.2 (based on aforesaid 
general power of attorney) is impugned by petitioners.

6. 
General power of attorney (Ex.P-3) is reflecting a note on the 
margin of its first page to the effect that the general power of 
attorney had been revoked through document No.102/4 dated 
28.04.2001 (Ex.P.2). It also contains two straight lines on both 
pages, which according to petitioners is symbol of losing its 
sanctity and efficacy, however in rebuttal, respondent No.1 
tendered copy of general power of attorney (Ex.D-7) and 
certification on it is dated 21.03.2002, but this document is not 
containing the aforesaid note of cancellation or lines. This 
document is later in date as compared to revocation deed (Ex.P-2). 
Moreover, no evidence in rebuttal of Ex.D-7 is produced by the 
petitioners/ plaintiffs. In such eventuality, petitioners were under 
legal burden to prove valid execution of revocation deed (Ex.P-2) 
by producing confidence inspiring oral evidence, however such 
course of action was not adopted, which is fatal to their stance.  
 
7. 
Though it is stance of petitioners that intimation regarding 
revocation of general power of attorney was duly conveyed to 
respondent No.1, as also alleged by PW-1 in his statement, however 
no other evidence to support this stance was presented, which may 
establish the mode of such intimation. Neither such deposition was 
made by any of other PWs nor such stance is visible from the 
contents of the plaint. Under section 202 read with section 206 of 
the Contract Act, 1872, the principal is duty bound to give notice 
to the agent before cancellation of the power of attorney. The 
power of attorney could only be rescinded after serving a notice 
upon the attorney and any revocation without notice to the 
attorney would be illegal. Reliance in this regard is placed on the 
case reported as Fayyaz-Ul-Haq and others v. Ghulam Nabi 
(Deceased) through his legal heirs and others (2022 MLD 688). 
 
8. 
Admittedly, mutation in question was attested on 25.05.2001 
and PW-2, during cross-examination, frankly conceded that 
predecessor of petitioners was well aware of the impugned mutation 
and petitioners got knowledge of the same immediately after its 

 
Civil Revision No.314-D of 2015 
5
execution / attestation. However, neither predecessor of petitioners 
nor petitioners themselves agitated the same and the suit was filed 
on 26.10.2009, after more than 08-years for which they do not 
possess any explanation for their inaction to do the needful, creating 
certain rights in favour of respondent No.2. The petitioners, 
therefore, had no locus standi to challenge the mutation 
independently, for their predecessor from whom they claimed 
certain rights in the suit property himself had not challenged the 
impugned mutation during his lifetime. Reference can be made to 
Abdul Haq and another v. Mst. Surrya Begum and others (2002 
SCMR 1330). 
 
9. 
Moreover, inaction on part of petitioners also invites 
applicability of the principles of waiver, estoppel and acquiescence. 
The implied consent in accepting the mutation in question 
constituted abandonment of rights on account of failure to enforce 
it. Reference in this regard can be made to Nazar Gul v. Islam and 3 
others (1998 SCMR 1223), Jamila Khatoon and others v. Aish 
Muhammad and others (2011 SCMR 222), Muhammad Rustam 
and another v. Mst.Makhan Jan and others (2013 SCMR 299), 
Agha Syed Mushtaque Ali Shah v. Mst.Bibi Gul Jan and others 
(2016 SCMR 910), Anjum Mahmood and 5 others v. Rizwan 
Ahmad and 7 others (2006 CLC 876) and Shero v. Muhammad 
Ramzan and 2 others (2006 YLR 2632).  
 
10. 
There is substance in the argument of learned counsel for 
petitioners that neither the agent himself could claim ownership 
rights in the land of the principal nor for his own kith and kin 
merely on the basis of agency document. It is sine qua non for him 
to have sought prior approval of the principal in that behalf after 
acquainting him with material circumstances on the subject, failing 
which the principal is at liberty to repudiate the transaction. 
However, in the instant case, such recourse was not adopted by the 
principal / predecessor of petitioners (despite having knowledge of 
the impugned mutation), thus, this argument is not helpful to 

 
Civil Revision No.314-D of 2015 
6
petitioners. Reference can be made to Muhammad Arshad and 2 
others v. Haq Nawaz and 9 others (2019 YLR 958). 
 
11. 
Learned counsel for petitioners has failed to pin point any 
illegality, material irregularity and jurisdictional defect in the 
impugned appellate judgment and decree, which is based on correct 
appreciation of evidence brought on record and applicable law / 
case law, hence no exception can be taken to it.  
 
12. 
In view of the above, instant revision petition, being devoid 
of merits, is hereby dismissed with no order as to costs.
