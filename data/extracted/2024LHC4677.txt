Through 
this 
constitutional petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioners have assailed the 
vires of notices dated 20.02.2021 issued by respondent No.3 
whereby petitioners were informed that according to amended 
Section 26 (1)(Q) of Forest Act, 1927 (Amended 2010) (hereinafter 
referred to as the Act) business with regard to establishment of 
Sawmills, firewood depots, wooden craft and furniture shops within 
the radius of 05 Miles (08 Kilometer) is prohibited, against the law 
and in case of violation six months imprisonment or fine or both 
sentences can be awarded and directed them to remove their 
business-places  away from 05 miles/08 Kilometers radius of the 
forest otherwise penal action would be taken.  
2. 
The petitioners maintained in their petition that they are 
carrying on business by establishing sawmills, firewood depots, 
wooden craft and furniture shops. In the year 2013, they were served 
similar type of notices by the respondent No.3 under Section 26(1)(Q) 

W.P. No.34094 of 2021. 
2
of the Act, 1927 for removal of their installations, carrying on 
business of sawmills, firewood depots, wooden craft and furniture 
shops outside the radius of 05 miles of the forest because it was a 
consistent threat to the forest. After some negotiation and 
deliberation, a regulatory mechanism was settled/agreed vide 
minutes dated 07.01.2013. In the light of said minutes of meeting, 
the petitioners get registration by submitting applications along with 
copy of computerized national identity card and deposit of 
Rs.10,000/- in the treasury. They further narrated that keeping in 
view the minutes of meeting dated 07.01.2013, a notification was 
also issued on 18.03.2013. Despite the fact that the petitioners got 
the registration and abiding by all terms and conditions, respondent 
No.3 again issued the impugned notices dated 20.02.2021 which are 
against facts and law and may be declared illegal, unlawful, void, 
malafide and unconstitutional and the same may graciously be struck 
down to meet the ends of justice.  
3. 
Report and para-wise comments were called from respondents 
which were accordingly submitted on 02.07.2021 wherein it was 
maintained that as per clause No.1 of the said minutes of meeting 
dated 07.01.2013 no firewood depots shall be allowed to be 
established within 05 miles radius of the forest; that as per clause 
No.2, no new sawmill shall be allowed within 05 Miles radius of the 
forest; that as per clause No.3, the owners of the existing sawmills 
shall get registration in the office of the Divisional Forest Officer 
within a period of 60 days; that as per condition No.12 of the 
agreement signed by the owner of the sawmill, the registration was 
for one year and on first day of January of every year, the owner will 
get his registration renewed by depositing the fee amounting to 
Rs.1000/-, otherwise his registration will be considered as cancelled; 
that 48 owners of sawmills got registration during the year 2013; that 
none of the said 48 owners got their registration renewed after 2013; 
that during the year 2021, a fresh survey of sawmills, 
timbers/firewood depots and furniture manufacturing shops was 
conducted which indicates that 281 units are working within five 

W.P. No.34094 of 2021. 
3
miles radius of the forest; that said installations are in violation of 
the clause No.1 & 2 of the minutes of the meeting dated 07.01.2013 
duly agreed by the owners of the sawmills; that the petitioners failed 
to fulfill the conditions and installed the sawmills within prohibited 
zone; that the notices were issued in accordance with Section 
26(1)(Q) of the Act and prayed for dismissal of the petition.  
4. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
perused the record with their able assistance. 
5. 
It evinces from the record that on 07.01.2013 a meeting was 
convened. Perusal of the minutes of the meeting reflects that after 
detailed deliberations following regulatory mechanism was agreed:- 
1. No firewood depot shall be allowed to establish within 5 mile 
radius of the forest.  
2. No new sawmill shall be allowed to establish within 5 mile 
radius of the forest.  
3. The owner of an existing sawmill shall get registration in the 
office of Divisional Forest Officer in whose jurisdiction the 
sawmill is situated, by submitting an application, a copy of 
computerized national identity card and proof of deposit of ten 
thousand rupees in the treasury as security in the name of 
DFO (refundable on closure of sawmill) within a period of 
sixty days.  
4. No person shall be allowed to operate a sawmill unless it has 
been registered in accordance with the forest department rules 
and upon signing the agreement with the Divisional Forest 
Officer in whose jurisdiction it falls.   
5. Only the small sized sawmills (upto 2 ¼ feet) being used for 
sawing of wood only for making of the articles of furniture and 
joinery for local use shall be allowed to operate and no 
commercial sawing shall be allowed, and violation thereof 
shall be liable to forfeiture besides any other punishment 
under the Act.  
6. No sawmill or a machinery for making articles of furniture 
and joinery, establishment under the Forest Act or the rules 
shall operate after the sunset and violation thereof shall be 
liable to forfeiture besides any other punishment under the Act.  
7. No owner of an existing sawmill shall be allowed to establish 
and operate a firewood depot at the sawmill site and violation 
thereof shall be liable to forfeiture besides any other 
punishment under the Act.  
8. Every person registering a sawmill shall observe all rules 
which may from time to time be notified under the Forest Act 
1927 (XVI of 1927), and shall maintain in respect of such 
depot, sawpit, sawmill, charcoal kiln such details in regard to 

W.P. No.34094 of 2021.

the source from which timber or firewood or charcoal is 
obtained.  
9. Registers:- The owner or person incharge of a sawmill shall 
maintain the following registers: 
a. Register of receipt of timber, firewood or charcoal

10.  
Every owner or person of sawmill shall provide the 
 
registers, prescribed above for security when called 
 
upon to do so by the Forest Officer.  
11.  
A forest Officer especially empowered by the Government

magistrate, arrest any person and may seize the timber, 
 
firewood and sawmill in respect of which the offence vis-
 
à-vis theft of forest produce directly or indirectly and or 
 
use of theft wood belonging to the forest, has been 
 
committed.  
12. The Forest Officer shall issue notices to the owners of the sale 
depots, sawpits, sawmills and Charcoal kilns which he 
believes that exist within five miles radius of the forest areas 
and the owners in question are liable to remove the same, 
unless registered and operated under the Act or the rules 
framed there under.  
 
 
Thereafter, the Establishment of Sawpits, Sawmill, Charcoal 
Kiln, Timber or Firewood Depot Rules, 2013, were promulgated 
through notification dated 18.03.2013 wherein the registration was 
declared to be mandatory and certain registers were also directed to 
be prepared. Rules 3 to 6 of the Rules ibid are reproduced as under:

(3) An owner or person Incharge of a small sized sawmill 
registered under sub-rule (2) shall not establish firewood 
depot at the site of sawmill.  
(4) The owner or person Incharge of a sawmill, timber or

(5) Every owner or person Incharge of a depot, sawpit, 
sawmill and charcoal kiln shall provide the registers, 
prescribed under sub-rule (1) to a Forest Officer whenever the 
Forest Officer wants to scrutinize the registers.  
 
6. 
Section 26 of the Act was substituted through the Forest 
(Amendment) Act, 2010 (Act XVII of 2010) dated 21.10.2010 
wherein offences relating to reserved forests and their punishments 
were introduced. Section 26(1)(Q)(2) of the Act provides as under: 
"Offences relating to reserved forests:- (1) A person, who in a 
reserved forest- 
(q) installs a saw mill, charcoal kiln or establishes timber or 
firewood depot or operates any mechanical aid designed to cut, 
fashion or covert a tree or timber or fabricates wood into 
articles of furniture, building materials, joinery articles of 
domestic or commercial use in or within five mile radius of the 
forest;  
Shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of this 
section,  
(2) If a person contravenes any provision of sub-section (1), 
the person shall be liable to punishment of imprisonment for a 
term which may extend to six months or fine mentioned in sub-
section (3) or to both.  
 
7. 
Afore-mentioned stipulations as well as Rules reflect that it 
was mandatory for the proprietor of the sawmills to get registration 
of their business establishment from the Forest Department and also 
maintain different registers (referred supra). Although, the petitioners 
have claimed that they are running the business after fulfilling all the 
formalitites but none of the petitioners have annexed any proof with 
this petition which may suggest that they ever got registration from 
the Forest Department. Moreover, no document has been brought on 
record to establish that requisite registers have been maintained by 
them. Even they failed to establish on record that they are not doing 

W.P. No.34094 of 2021. 
7
their business within the five miles (eight kilometers) radius of the 
forest. In absence of such details, the petitioners are not justified to 
challenge the impugned notices.  
8. 
On the other hand, respondent-Department has submitted that 
the owners of the sawmills have neither fulfilled the clauses of the 
minutes of meeting dated 07.01.2013 nor have following the 
conditions of agreement duly signed by them in the year 2013. It is 
further mentioned that in the year 2013 only 48 installations were 
working in the area but now after mushroom growth said number has 
reached to 281 which is illegal and against the law.  
9. 
Above discussion reflects that the petitioners claimed that they 
are doing business after observing all codal formalities and 
respondent-Department is negating their stance. This Court, while 
sitting in writ jurisdiction, cannot delve into factual depth to resolve 
the whole dispute in a slipshod manner. The questions which involve 
factual controversies cannot be resolved by this Court through the 
present summary procedure under Article 199 of the Constitution.. 
10. 
The primary purpose for relocating sawmills and related 
operations away from forests is to protect natural ecosystems. When 
sawmills 
operate 
near 
forests, 
they 
often 
contribute 
to 
overexploitation, leading to deforestation and loss of biodiversity. 
Relocating these industries can foster a culture of responsible 
sourcing, promoting practices that prioritize forest regeneration and 
conservation. Industrial activities, such as those carried out in 
sawmills, can generate significant pollution in the form of noise, dust, 
and waste. The proximity of these operations to forested areas poses 
a risk to the surrounding environment, affecting air quality and water 
sources.  
11. 
The rationale behind shifting sawmills, firewood godowns, 
and furniture showrooms away from forests is multifaceted, 
encompassing environmental, economic, and social dimensions. This 
transition not only protects fragile ecosystems and promotes 
sustainable resource management but also contributes to cleaner 
urban environments and improved community relations. As the 

W.P. No.34094 of 2021. 
8
world grapples with the challenges of climate change and 
biodiversity loss, embracing such strategies will be essential for 
achieving a sustainable future that balances industrial needs with 
ecological preservation. By prioritizing the health of forests and 
communities, the way can be paved for a more harmonious 
coexistence between industry and nature. 
12. 
In the present era of global warming, there is a need to work 
rigorously to protect the forests. Forests are often referred to as the 
lungs of the Earth. They play a crucial role in mitigating climate 
change 
and 
combating 
global 
warming 
through 
several 
interconnected processes. From carbon sequestration to biodiversity 
preservation, forests are essential in our efforts to create a 
sustainable future.  
13. 
In view of the above, respondents have rightly issued notices 
to the petitioners to shift their sawmills etc. away from the 05 miles 
(08 kilometers) radius of the forest boundary. Learned counsel 
appearing on behalf of the petitioners remained unable to make out a 
case of interference.  
14. 
As a corollary of above discussion, this petition is dismissed 
being devoid of any force/substance.
