5th Semester in the year 2012. The appellant experienced pain in 
her arm on 11.12.2012, thus she along with her father (Sajjad 
Anwar) went to Allied Hospital, Faisalabad (hereinafter referred 
to as the “Hospital”) for medical checkup. After radiography (X-
ray), the appellant was diagnosed with “Cervical Rib” disease and 
Prof. Dr. Rasool Ahmed Chaudhary [hereinafter referred to as 
“respondent/defendant”], an Orthopedic Surgeon of the said 
Hospital advised for immediate surgery and on the same day the 
appellant was admitted in the Hospital. The respondent 
performed surgery of the appellant on 17.12.2012 but the 
appellant complained on 18.12.2012 that she could not sit as her 
lower section of the body was not functioning and she had lost 
control over urination and bowels. The father of the appellant 
accordingly informed the said condition to the respondent who at 
that stage, sought an advice from Neurosurgeon of the Hospital. 
After MRI & CT Scan tests, Dr. Tariq Ahmad, Neurosurgeon 
opined that during surgery process, three vertebrae, (TI, T2 & T3) 
of appellant were damaged and spinal cord got cut due to 
negligence of the surgeon/respondent.  
 
The father of appellant made complaint to the Hospital 
administration and accordingly a medical board comprising of (i) 
Dr. Javed Iqbal (Neuro Physician), (ii) Dr. Syed Anjum Mehdi 
(Asst. Prof. of Radiology), (iii) Dr. Shehzad Awais (Prof. of 
Surgery) and (iv) Dr. Tariq Ahmed (Head of Neurosurgery, 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023

Department) was constituted to probe the matter. The said board 
submitted its report on 29.12.2012 and held that the respondent/ 
defendant has committed negligence while conducting operation 
due to which appellant/plaintiff has lost control over her lower 
portion of the body.  
 
Against the above sheer medical negligence of the 
respondent, a complaint was filed with the Punjab Healthcare 
Commission, who after a thorough probe into the matter and 
obtaining opinions of Medical Experts of the relevant fields, gave 
final findings making recommendation to the Government of 
Punjab for taking various stern actions against the respondent. 
Being dissatisfied with the said opinion/ observation, the 
respondent preferred an appeal before the Sessions Judge, 
Faisalabad who dismissed the appeal on 16.12.2014 holding the 
respondent as guilty of medical negligence. Against the above 
said orders, the respondent filed Writ Petition [No.1031/2015] 
which was also dismissed on 20.09.2016. That even the Health 
Department after holding independent inquiry, found the 
respondent negligent and vide order dated 29.04.2015 imposed 
major penalty of withdrawing of his pension under Section 
4(1)(c)(ii) of the Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and 
Accountability Act, 2006.  
 
After the above determinations of negligence of 
respondent, the appellant filed a suit for recovery of Rs.750 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
4
million by way of damages against the respondent. In response to 
the notice, the respondent appeared and filed contesting written 
statement on the factual and legal parlances. As per divergent 
pleading, the learned trial court framed issues, recorded pro and 
contra evidence of the parties  and partially decreed the suit to the 
extent of Rs.50,00,000/- and declined rest of the claim of the 
appellant vide judgment and decree dated 12.09.2023. Hence, this 
appeal with the prayer that the suit may be decreed as prayed for 
on the ground that the impugned judgment & decree to the extent 
of denying rest of the claim of the appellant is based on mis-
reading and non-reading of record and evidence.   
4.  The respondent/defendant has also challenged the above 
judgment & decree of the trial Court through the connected 
appeal (RFA No.74489-2023) contending that the impugned 
judgment and decree was passed on the basis of mis-reading and 
non-reading of evidence as well as record, as such it may be set-
aside and the suit of the appellant/ plaintiff may be dismissed.  
5.    We have heard the arguments of the learned counsels for the 
parties and gone through the record.   
6.  The main controversy involved in these appeals is centered 
upon issue No.1 which is reproduced as under:- 
“1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount 
of Rs.750/-million, from the defendant by way of damages 
and compensation for the wrong, unauthorized, negligent, 
medical advice/operation conducted by him, which resulted 
in her disability, malady of breathing corpse, alongwih 
spoiling of her academic career? OPP”

Onus was upon the appellant/plaintiff to prove the claim as well 
as the above issue. The appellant/plaintiff, Marriam Sajjad herself 
appeared as PW1 and stated that she was a student of BSc in 
Agriculture University, Faisalabad. That she felt pain in her arm 
about one month before her operation. She along with her father 
went to the Hospital where respondent/Dr. Rasool Ahmed, the 
head of Orthopedic Surgery medically examined her and told that 
her problem is of Cervical Ribs, which needed prompt surgery 
and also cautioned that if the surgery is not done at the earliest 
then her arm and lungs would be damaged. On 17.12.2012, the 
appellant was operated upon by the defendant and after the 
surgery she felt senselessness of her lower portion of body and 
lost her control over urination and bowels. Next day, the 
defendant checked her and referred her to Ghurki Hospital, 
Lahore for further treatment. That medical board was constituted 
in Hospital and her MRI & CT scan were conducted wherein it 
was opined that Cervical Rib of the appellant/plaintiff is intact as 
it was before operation whereas her vertebrae (T1, T2 & T3) as 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
6
well as spinal cord were damaged whereas Cervical Rib was not 
cured. They (appellant) filed application to the Punjab Healthcare 
Commission wherein it was declared that the defendant 
conducted a wrong operation and due to his negligence her body 
was damaged. That Dr. Rasool Ahmad, an Orthopedic surgeon 
made a wrong medical advice. After operation, she was not in a 
position to walk and stand without any support. She is no more in 
a position to live a normal life as her body was also damaged. 
She claimed damages of 30 crore for body damages, 10 crore for 
loss of social activities, 15 crore for suffering of pain and 
incapacitation, 5 to 10 crore for loss of pleasure, 10 crore for 
mental worry, anxiety and spoiling of her future and further 
Rs.10 crore should be given as fine to her. That she went

Cervical Ribs and also opined that if the operation is not done at 
the earliest, the arms of the plaintiff would become useless and 
her lungs would burst. On 17.12.2012, the operation was done 
and normally this kind of operation is not done by Orthopedic 
surgeon and if the same was to be performed by him then it was 
to be done in the presence of a Neurosurgeon. After MRI and CT 
scan, the Neurosurgeon came to the conclusion that lower body 
of the plaintiff was not working, as two vertebrae of the plaintiff 
were completely damaged whereas third was half damaged and 
spinal cord was also damaged. That a board was constituted in 
Allied Hospital which also opined that the Cervical Rib is intact 
as it was before operation but the vertebrae were broken and 
spinal cord was damaged due to negligence of the defendant. On

sent to Ghurki Hospital where second operation of vertebrae was 
conducted and Titanium cage was installed, but even then she is 
not in a position to live normal life. In cross examination, he

Before discussing the oral as well as documentary 
evidence, it is appropriate to firstly have a glance at the definition 
of “medical negligence” as defined in Section 19 (1) of the 
Punjab Healthcare Commission Act, 2010, which is reproduced 
as under:- 
“19. Medical negligence.—(1) Subject to sub-section (2), a healthcare 
service provider may be held guilty of medical negligent on one of the 
following two findings:-- 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
13
(a) 
the healthcare establishment does not have the 
requisite human resource and equipments which it professes to 
have possessed; or  
(b) 
he or any of his employee did not, in the given case, 
exercise with reasonable competence the skill which he or his 
employee did possess.” 
Further, “medical negligence” can be elaborated as under:- 
1. Duty of Care: Healthcare providers have a legal and ethical duty to 
provide a reasonable standard of care to their patients.  
2. Breach of Duty: Negligence occurs when a healthcare provider fails 
to meet the standard of care that is expected in the field. This can 
involve 
errors 
in 
diagnosis, 
treatment, 
surgery. 
medication 
administration, or communication. 
3. Caution: The breach of the standard of care must be shown to have 
directly caused harm or injury to the patient. It must be proven that the 
negligence was a significant factor in the patient's adverse outcome. 
4. Damages: To pursue a medical negligence claim, the patient must 
have suffered actual harm, such as physical injury, emotional distress, 
additional medical expenses, loss of income, or other damages. 
Common examples of medical negligence include misdiagnosis or 
delayed diagnosis, surgical errors, medication errors, birth injuries, 
failure to obtain informed consent, and failure to properly monitor a 
patient's condition. 
In this case, admittedly appellant/plaintiff Marriam Sajjad was 
admitted in Hospital due to arm pain and the respondent/ 
defendant diagnosed the issue of “cervical rib” and advised 
immediate operation of the patient with the warning that any 
delay whereof would spoil the arm and lungs of the plaintiff. As 
the surgery was suggested for cervical Ribs but the requisite 
surgery was not done rather during operation the Vertebrae T1, 
T2, T3 along-with spinal cord of the patient were damaged due to 
negligence of the surgeon/ respondent/ defendant; consequently, 
the lower portion of body of the appellant/ plaintiff could not 
move and since then she is not in a position to walk & stand 
without support. A board of expert Doctors was constituted in 
Hospital who submitted report (Ex.P-2) on 29.12.2012 declaring 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
14
that the respondent/ defendant committed medical negligence 
during process of surgery. The said report (Exh.P2) was never 
challenged by the respondent before any forum. For ready 
reference, operative part of report is reproduced as under:- 
  
“Patient developed paraparesis post operatively. On 
20.12.2012 Prof. Dr. Rasool Ahmed Ch. Called neurosurgeon 
Prof. Dr. Tariq Ahmed to visit patient on 20.12.2012. The 
neurosurgeon examined the patient and found that the power in 
Right lower limb was grade zero but pin sensation was present 
while the power of Left lower limb was 2 but pin sensation was 
absent. There was tenderness on palpation of upper thoracic 
spine so he advised MRI of thoracic spine which was conducted 
on the same day on 20.12.12. Meanwhile the patient developed 
respiratory distress and was shifted to main ICU on 22.12.2012 
where she remained for 6 days and was shifted to private ward 
after clinical stability. Her neurological status remains the same. 
 To evaluate the cause of her neurological deterioration, Scot 
film of CT Scan, CT scan cervical and upper dorsal spine – 
axial, saggital, and reformatted images and IV contract was also 
given. MRI long and short axis with water and fat intensity and 
with IV contract also taken. According to report of Radiologist 
Dr. Anjum Mehdi Assistant professor of Radiology: 
Both cervical ribs are present as seen in pre-operative 
films. 
CT reformatted images show T1 (Drorsal vertebra) --more 
than 2/3rd of its body non visualized. No bony chip seen 
close to the vertebral body area 
The T2 vertebral body not seen mostly on right side with 
few bony chips extending into the bony spinal canal. 
The T3 vertebra body anterior endplate also having 
irregular shape.  
MRI of cervical and dorsal spine show cord contusion at level of 
T2-T3 vertebral level with slight widening due to edema. T1 W 
hypointense and T2 W hyperintense area in front of the T1-T3 
noted and with IV contrast showing no enhancement. Similarly 
CT with IV contract shows no enhancement of given area. To be 
correlated with clinical and surgical findings. 
The board is of the view that there was inadvertent trauma to T1 
and T2 vertebrae bodies alongwith contusion of the cord at the 
same level during the course of surgery, which is probably the 
cause of paraparesis of Miss Maryam.”

9. 
On the complaint of the plaintiff, the Punjab Healthcare 
Commission (hereinafter referred to as “Commission”) recorded 
evidence of the parties and also obtained opinions from different 
medical experts (Doctors) regarding the matter in issue. In the 
first expert opinion of Neurosurgeon [available on page No.7 of 
order of Punjab Healthcare Commission (Exh.P.3)], it is 
mentioned that the respondent was incompetent who committed 
deliberate negligence and he should be debarred from doing any 
further procedures of surgery relating to spinal cord and nerves. 
The said expert opinion was presented before the expert of 
Orthopedics field who also agreed with the said opinion. The 
relevant expert opinion as mentioned in Exh.P3 as well as the 
decision of the Punjab Healthcare Commission are reproduced as 
under:- 
“OPINIONS OF THE EXPERTS:- 
11. The Expert in the field of Neurosurgery opined as follows: 
“I suggest that such cases should be deliberated by a group of experts. 
In my opinion, in this case there is incompetence on the part of surgeon. 
He should be debarred from procedures related to spine/spinal cord 
and nerves.” 
The case was then presented to the Expert in the field of Orthopaedics, 
who opined as follows: 
“I have gone through the entire case and read the statements of various 
experts. I agree with the findings of the committee constituted at 
PMC/Allied Hospital Faisalabad. That the complications have taken 
place inadvertently although the surgery was carried out in the major 
tertiary hospital with best possible environment. The mistake committed 
cannot be labeled as a neglect but it was due to misjudgment. The 
complainant needs to be compensated adequately according to the 
latest status of paralysis of the patient.” 
The case was presented to another Expert in the field of Orthopaedics, 
who opined as follows: 
“The problem has resulted from surgical error which has been admitted 
by the surgeon. The furthering of the case needs understanding that the 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
16
surgical error is a question of professional practise, not a criminal 
action. The surgeon may be stopped from operating on similar cases of 
cervical spine in the future. This will serve three purposes the 
professional punishment, lesson for other surgeons and satisfaction to 
the complainant.” 
The case was then presented to another Expert in the field of 
Neurosurgery, who opined as follows: 
“I have critically evaluated the record brought in front of me regarding 
the case of Miss Maryam Sajjad and the proceedings of the medical 
board constituted at PMC Faisalabad consisting of the following:- 
Prof Dr. Tariq Ahmad  
Chairman 
Prof Dr Shahzad Awais 
Dr. Syed Anjum Mehdi AP Radiology 
Dr. Javed Iqbal 
 
 
Member 
 
I endorse the report of medical board that the condition of the patient 
worsened after the surgery because of the surgical error made by the 
surgeon Prof Dr. Rasul Ahmed Chaudhari. I further suggest that the 
said surgeon should be debarred from doing spinal surgery and the 
procedures like excision of cervical rib, in future.” 
12.The said opinions were shared with both the sides vide letters dated 
01-11-2013. They were instructed to submit their replies till 08-11-
2013. It was also pointed out to them that the opinions of the Experts 
may/may not have any implication on the final decision of the case. 
13. The Complainant submitted his comments on the experts' opinions 
on 07-11-2013, whereby the said opinions were reinforced by the 
Complainant, highlighting the negligence and absence of good faith, 
due care and attention. While relying on material downloaded from 
websites, 
that 
is, 
Mayoclinic, 
NHS/UK 
and patient.co.uk/ 
doctor/ cervical ribs and thoracic outlet syndrome, it was also pointed 
out that the said surgery should have been the last resort and 
physiotherapy should have been the first option. It was added that no 
complications were explained to them. The patient was admitted for 
surgery on 11-12-2012, the same day without any second consideration. 
It was also pointed out that the experts through their opinions should not 
have expressed their views on the criminal liability or otherwise, in the 
case in hand, as this aspect fell within the competence of the 
Commission. 
……….. 
17. After thorough deliberations and taking into consideration the 
record, the Board directs as follows: 
a) The Healthcare Establishment to pay the fine of Rs. 100,000 in view 
of the fact that the said negligence as detailed above was committed at 
its Operation Theatre as well as keeping in view the fact that it failed to 
implement the basic requirements of the profession for obtaining an 
informed consent, on a proper Consent Form and also due to the fact 
that it also failed to ensure the practice of communicating with the 
patient and or her family about the complications of the surgery, in 
question. 
b) It is strongly recommended to the Pakistan Medical and Dental 
Council to consider the removal of the name of Dr. Rasul A. Ch. from 
the Register(s) maintained by it. 
c) The case of Dr. Rasul A. Ch. be referred to the Health Department, 
Government of Punjab; 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
17
i. 
To take Disciplinary Action against him in view of his 
negligence /misconduct/inefficiency. 
 
ii. 
To consider suspending all proceedings on processing his 
retirement case until the final outcome of the disciplinary 
proceedings. 
d) The Government of Punjab or the competent authority, as the case 
may be, may consider confiscation of all or any of the post-retirement 
monetary benefits due to Dr. Rasul A. Ch. in order to compensate the 
patient for further management of her morbidity. 
e) The Healthcare Establishment must immediately ensure the 
implementation of the Minimum Service Delivery Standards already 
provided to it by the Punjab Healthcare Commission. 
f) The Health Department, Government of Punjab may make efforts to 
ensure that the patient is adequately compensated monetarily and all 
possible medical treatment is made available to her, free of cost, within 
the country. 
The above is the true & attested copy of the decision of the Board as 
taken during its meeting dated 17-12-2013.” 
10. 
The respondent/ defendant while appearing as DW1 
admitted that he advised the appellant for operation of Cervical 
Ribs and admitted her in Hospital for the operation of Cervical 
Ribs but in this regard he did not seek any instruction or 
consultation with the Neurosurgeon. However, after operation 
when the appellant voiced complaint regarding numbness 
(paralysis) of her lower portion of body then the Neurosurgeon 
was engaged who opined the permanent loss of control over the 
lower portion of the body due to negligence of the surgeon/ 
respondent. It is important to mention here that as per MRI and 
CT scan reports, the Cervical Ribs were intact as it were before 
surgery. Thus, it is proved on record that the respondent 
committed negligence in the surgery of the appellant.

11. 
Under the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, Chapter-I (Articles 8 to 28), a human life is given 
extraordinary sanctity and importance and same cannot be left 
vulnerable to mischief of the negligent. The Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in Punjab Road Transport Corporation’s   
case1 has observed that promotion of law of tort is imperative so 
that the people must understand that they could not live as a 
nation without performing their duties within the framework of 
law and held that “11. The Constitution of a country is a kind of 
social contract which binds people, society and a State. The 
terms of the contract foster feelings of interdependence of 
belonging to an entity and of adherence to law. An honest 
commitment to the goals set out in the Constitution ensures 
promotion of nationhood and stability of the system. In view of 
Article 4 read with Article 5(2) of the Constitution, it is the duty 
of each and every organ of the State and people of Pakistan to 
work within the framework of Constitution and law as law laid 
down by this Court in the following judgments:-- (1) Ch. Zahoor 
Elahi's case PLD 1975 SC 383 and (2) Zahid Rafique's case PLD 
1995 SC 530. 
12. Our Constitution contains Chapter I relating "Fundamental 
Rights" in which life of human being is given due importance. It 
requires everyone to work for the welfare of the people of 
                                          
1 Punjab Road Transport Corporation Vs Zahida Afzal & Others (2006 SCMR 207)

Pakistan but a person who is violating the law and Constitution 
works against the welfare of the people that is why it is high time 
to promote the law of tort so that the people must understand that 
we cannot live as a nation without performing our duties within 
the framework of law. As in the present admittedly the driver had 
driven the bus in violation of the mandatory provisions of Motor 
Vehicle Ordinance, 1965 and rules framed thereunder thus, 
causing fatal injuries to the innocent citizens. 
13. It is pertinent to mention here that mere framing of law does 
not provide good result unless the law is strictly implemented by 
all the sections of the society in letter and spirit without fear, 
favour and nepotism as envisaged in "Sura-e-Baqra" of Holy 
Qur'an. To achieve the goal of ensuring every citizen and organ 
of the State on a right path the nation, as a whole, has to honour 
the commitment in terms of the Constitution and law. One of the 
modes to achieve this goal is to file a suit for damages against the 
offenders by the aggrieved persons. It is the duty of the members 
of the Bar Associations and Bar Council to educate the people 
and to file suits for damages against the offenders apart from the 
criminal proceedings. It is also the duty and obligation of media 
to provide to cultivate awareness of rights specially law of tort 
which will ultimately bring/compel every authority and 
functionary including the Chief Executive of the country to work 
within the framework of law and Constitution.” In Dr. Atta 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
20
Muhammad Khanzada’s case2, an eye of the patient was damaged 
by Eye Specialist/Doctor. The suit for damages was instituted and 
same was decreed under the Tort and amount of costs was also 
granted and it was held that “11. There is also no force in the 
contention that the respondent was not entitled to claim or get 
damages as the operation was conducted with his consent. The 
respondent had admittedly consented to the operation but 
his? consent is immaterial for the simple reason that the consent 
of a patient or his relatives does not absolve the doctor from 
performing his professional duties with care and caution. In this 
context the principles stated in the following excerpt from 
Halsbury's Laws of England, which were affirmed by the 
Supreme Court of India in Dr. Laxman Balkrishna Joshi v. Dr. 
Taimbak Bapu Godbole (AIR 1969 SC 128) may be reproduced 
advantageously;-- "22. Negligence: duties owed to patient --A 
person who holds himself out ready to give medical advice or 
treatment impliedly undertakes that he is possessed of skill and 
knowledge for the purpose. Such a person, whether he is a 
registered medical practitioner or not, who is consulted by a 
patient owes him certain duties, namely, a duty of care in 
deciding whether to undertake the case; a duty of care in 
deciding what treatment to give and duty of care in his 
administration of that treatment. A breach of any these duties will

support in action for negligence by the patient." In Dr. Laxman 
Balkrishna Joshi’s case3, in an accident, a patient was entertained 
by a surgeon but due to negligence, the body of the patient was 
spoiled and the Indian Supreme Court held that “11. The duties 
which a doctor owes to his patient are clear. A person who holds 
himself out ready to give medical advice and treatment impliedly 
undertakes that he is possessed of skill and knowledge for the 
purpose. Such a person when consulted by a patient owes him 
certain duties, viz., a duty of care in deciding whether to 
undertake the case, a duty of care in deciding what treatment to 
give or a duty of care in the administration of that treatment. A 
breach of any of those duties gives a right of action for 
negligence to the patient. The practitioner must bring to his task 
a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge and must exercise a 
reasonable degree of care. Neither the very highest nor a very 
low degree of care and competence judged in the light of the 
particular circumstances of each case is what the law requires:- 
(of. Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd ed. vol. 26 p. 17). The 
doctor no doubt has a discretion in choosing treatment which he 
proposes to give to the patient and such discretion is relatively 
ampler in cases of emergency. But the question is not whether the 
judgment or discretion in choosing the treatment he exercised 
was right or wrong, for, as Mr. Purshottam rightly agreed, no

128) 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
22
such question arises in the present case because if we come to the 
same conclusion as the High Court, viz., that what the appellant 
did was to reduce the fracture without giving anaesthetic to the 
boy, there could be no manner of doubt of his being guilty of 
negligence and carelessness. He also said that he was not 
pressing the question whether in this action filed under the Fatal 
Accidents Act (XIII of 1855) the respondents would be entitled to 
get damages. The question, therefore, is within a small compass, 
namely, whether the concurrent findings of the trial court and the 
High Court that what the appellant did was reduction of the 
fracture without giving anaesthetic to the boy and not mere 
immobilisation with light traction as was his case, is based on 
evidence or is the result of mere conjectures or surmises or of 
misunderstanding of that evidence.” In State of Haryana’s case4, 
it is held that every doctor who enters into the medical profession 
has a duty to act with a reasonable degree of care and skill as 
implied undertaking and held that “6. The trial Court as also the 
lower appellate Court both recorded concurrent findings of fact 
that the sterilisation operation performed upon Smt. Santra was 
not 'complete' as in that operation only the right Fallopian Tube 
was operated upon while the left Tube was left untouched. The 
Courts were of the opinion that this exhibited negligence on the 
part of the Medical Officer who performed the operation. Smt. 
                                          
4 State of Haryana vs. Smt. Santra (2000 AIR (SC) 1888) 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
23
Santra, in spite of the unsuccessful operation, was informed that 
sterilisation operation was successful and that she would not 
conceive any child in future. The plea of estoppel raised by the 
defendants was also rejected. The trial Court has recorded the 
following findings on the question of negligence :-  "The birth of 
the female child by plaintiff Smt. Santra after operation for 
sterilisation is not disputed and the case of the deft. is that there 
was no negligence and carelessness on the part of the deft. but on 
going through the documents placed on the file as well as 
testimony of PWs that the medical officer who conducted the 
operation has threw the care and caution to the winds and 
focussed attention to perform as many as operations as possible 
to build record and earn publicity. It is in such setting that a poor 
lady obsessed to plan his (her) family, was negligently operated 
upon and treated and left in the lurch to suffer agony and burden 
which he was made to believe was avoidable. Therefore, the act 
of the DW2 Dr. Sushil Kumar Goel shows that he did not perform 
his duty to the best of his ability and with due care and caution 
and due to the above said act, the plaintiff has to suffer mental 
pain and agony and burden of financial liability." 9. Negligence 
is a 'tort'. Every Doctor who enters into the medical profession 
has a duty to act with a reasonable degree of care and skill. This 
is what is known as 'implied undertaking' by a member of the 
medical profession that he would use a fair, reasonable and 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
24
competent degree of skill. In Bolam v. Friern Hospital 
Management Committee, 1957(2) All England Reporter 118, 
McNair, J. summed up the law as under: "The test is the standard 
of the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have that 
special skill. A man need not possess the highest expert skill; it is 
well established law that it is sufficient if he exercises the 
ordinary skill of an ordinary competent man exercising that 
particular art. In the case of a medical man, negligence means 
failure to act in accordance with the standards of reasonably 
competent medical men at the time. There may be one or more 
perfectly proper standards, and if he conforms with one of these 
proper standards, then he is not negligent". 11. In two decisions 
rendered by this Court, namely, Dr. Laxman Balakrishna Joshi 
v. Dr. Trimbak Bapu Godbole and another, AIR 1969 Supreme 
Court 128 and A.S. Mittal v. State of U.P., AIR 1989 Supreme 
Court 1570, it was laid down that when a Doctor is consulted by 
a patient, the former, namely, the Doctor owes to his patient 
certain duties which are (a) a duty of care in deciding whether to 
undertake the case; (b) a duty of care in deciding what treatment 
to give; and (c) a duty of care in the administration of that 
treatment. A breach of any of the above duties may give a cause 
of action for negligence and the patient may on that basis recover 
damages from his Doctor. In a recent decision in Poonam Verma 
v. Ashwin Patel and others, 1996(4) SCC 332 where the question 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
25
of medical negligence was considered in the context of treatment 
of a patient, it was observed as under: “40. Negligence has many 
manifestations - it may be active negligence, collateral 
negligence, comparative negligence, concurrent negligence, 
continued negligence, criminal negligence, gross negligence, 
hazardous negligence, active and passive negligence, wilful or 
reckless negligence or Negligence per se, which is defined in 
Black's Law Dictionary as under: Negligence per se : Conduct, 
whether of action or omission, which may be declared and 
treated as negligence without any argument or proof as to the 
particular surrounding circumstances, either because it is in 
violation of a statute or valid municipal ordinance, or because it 
is so palpably opposed to the dictates of common prudence that it 
can be said without hesitation or doubt that no careful person 
would have been guilty of it. As a general rule, the violation of a 
public duty, enjoined by law for the protection of person or 
property, so constitutes.” In Darnley’s case5, the Supreme Court 
of United Kingdom declared that even the duty of care is also 
needed from the staff of the hospital with regard to information 
given to the patient on which basis the patient suffers loss, as 
such patient who was given wrong information by the staff of the 
hospital is entitled for damages and held that “29. This 
reasoning, however, fails to take account of the effect of the 
                                          
5 Darnley Vs Croydon Health Services NHS Trust (2019 SCMR 143) 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
26
misleading information with which the appellant was provided 
and of three critical findings of fact made by the trial judge. 
First, the judge found that, if the appellant had been told that he 
would be seen within 30 minutes, he would have stayed in the 
waiting area and would have been seen before he left. He would 
then have been admitted or told to wait. He would have waited 
and his later collapse would have occurred within a hospital 
setting. Secondly, the judge found that the appellant's decision to 
leave was made, in part at least, on the basis of information 
provided to him by the receptionist which was inaccurate or 
incomplete. Thirdly, the judge found that it was reasonably 
foreseeable that a person who believes that it may be four or five 
hours before he will be seen by a doctor may decide to leave, in 
circumstances where that person would have stayed if he believed 
he would be seen much sooner by a triage nurse. The conclusion 
of the majority of the Court of Appeal on this point seems to me 
to be inconsistent with these findings of fact. Far from 
constituting a break in the chain of causation, the appellant's 
decision to leave was reasonably foreseeable and was made, at 
least in part, on the basis of the misleading information that he 
would have to wait for up to four or five hours before being seen 
by a doctor. In this regard it is also relevant that the appellant 
had just sustained what was later discovered to be a very grave 
head injury. Both the appellant and Mr Tubman had told the 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
27
receptionist that the appellant was really unwell and needed 
urgent attention. The appellant told her that he felt as if he was 
about to collapse. He was in a particularly vulnerable condition 
and did, in fact, collapse as a result of his injury within an hour 
of leaving the hospital. In these circumstances, one can readily 
appreciate how the judge came to his conclusion that the 
appellant's departure was reasonably foreseeable.  
30. The trial judge made a further finding of fact that had the 
appellant suffered the collapse at around 21:30 whilst at the 
Mayday Hospital, he would have been transferred to St George's 
Hospital and would have undergone surgery earlier with the 
result that he would have made a very near full recovery.  
31. In these circumstances, the case that the appellant's 
unannounced departure from the A & E department broke the 
chain of causation is simply not made out.”6 
12. 
As regard the objection/argument of learned counsel for 
the respondent that the suit of the appellant is not competent as 
the remedy of complaint has already been availed before the 
Punjab Healthcare Commission, suffice it to say that the Punjab 
Healthcare Commission Act, 2010 has been promulgated to 
improve the quality of healthcare services. The functions and 
powers of the Punjab Healthcare Commission have been given in 
                                          
6 Montgomery Vs Lanarkshire Health Board (2015 SCMR 663) & Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Railways & Others Vs Abdul Wahid & Others (2011 
SCMR 1836) 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
28
Section 4 of the Act ibid and sub-section (7) of Section 4 of the 
Act ibid deals with the complaint of an aggrieved person. For 
ready reference, sub-section (7) is reproduced as under  
“(7)  Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, the 
Commission may– 
            (a)  on a complaint by any aggrieved person; or 
            (b)  on a complaint by any aggrieved healthcare service 
provider; 
and shall– 
            (c)  on a reference by the Government or the Provincial 
Assembly of the Punjab; or 
            (d) on a motion of the Supreme Court of Pakistan or 
the Lahore High Court made during the course of any 
proceedings before it, 
undertake investigation into allegations of maladministration, 
malpractice or failures on the part of a healthcare service 
provider, or any employee of the healthcare service provider.” 
The Punjab Healthcare Commission can investigate into the 
allegations of malpractice or failure on the part of healthcare 
service provider and can announce order in this regard but it has 
no jurisdiction to grant damages to a person affected by such 
service whereas said relief can only be granted by the Civil Court 
if an aggrieved person proves his case. Furthermore, under the 
Act ibid even no bar has been imposed upon an aggrieved person 
to approach Civil Court for claim of damages against any 
healthcare service provider. As such the argument of learned 
counsel for the respondent have no force and same is repelled.  
13.  
The active medical negligence of the respondent has stood 
established from the record. Here the main issue before this Court 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
29
is that what is litmus or standard or mode for assessment of 
compensatory damage in medical negligence? The cases related 
to medical malpractice are dealt with by courts under “Law of 
Torts”. Pakistan follows English Law for deciding the cases of 
medical malpractice. The claims of medical malpractice are 
mostly brought in respect of death, personal injuries and financial 
loss suffered due to the negligence. The principles applied for the 
calculation of damages in medical negligence cases are similar to 
one applied in general cases of negligence in tort. While granting 
claim for damages the court of law and equity normally adhere to 
the following principles: 
i)  Reasonable and fair monetary compensation for the 
injury caused.  
ii) Small amount of damages can be granted under the 
head of pain and suffering.  
iii) Loss of Amenity includes the loss of activities of 
claimant, 
his 
job 
satisfaction, 
hobbies, 
and 
recreational activities. Court will consider all these 
losses during award of damages. This will include in 
the damage even if the patient is unconscious and 
does not realize the loss of all these activities.  
iv) Medical Expenses: A patient can recover medical and 
other expenses as damages.7 Likewise, damages can 
be granted for traveling costs and additional housing 
or adapting accommodation for the special needs of 
the patient.8 
v)  Loss of Earning must be estimated for two periods. 
First: the lost incomes due to the medical malpractice 
                                          
7 Herring, Medical Law and Ethics, 124 
8 Jones, Medical Negligence, 1001-1002 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
30
till the date of estimation. Secondly, future loss of 
earnings. Calculating the prospective loss of earning 
is a difficult question for the court.9  
 
vi) Pecuniary Loss: A patient who is a victim of medical 
negligence usually suffers from pecuniary cases such 
as, medical expenses, traveling expenses, the cost of 
equipment bought because of the injury, loss of 
earning, future loss of earning and cost of hiring 
someone else for performing chores which the patient 
is no longer able to perform due to the injury caused 
to him because of medical negligence. 
vii) Pain and Suffering & non pecuniary loss:- A patient 
can be awarded damages for the pain and suffering as 
a result of injury because of medical malpractice. If 
patient faces humiliation, discomfort or any part of 
his body got disfigured or his life expectancy has 
been significantly reduced because of the negligent 
behavior of the medical practitioner, he is entitled to 
damages. Similarly, if a patient develops any 
psychiatric condition due to the injury, it will be 
reflected in the award of damages. 
 
14. 
From the above discussion, it is crystal clear that the 
respondent/defendant committed sheer medical negligence while 
performing procedure of surgery upon the appellant/plaintiff due 
to which the lower portion of body of the appellant/plaintiff has 
become paralyzed and for rest of life she is unable to stand and 
walk without any support of others. The appellant/plaintiff is not 
in a position to move freely, perform function and live a normal 
life, which misfortune though cannot be undone, as the loss 
caused to the appellant/plaintiff cannot be compensated in terms 
                                          
9 [2003 EWCA Civ 528 and [1980] A.C 138 

 
RFA.No.70634/2023 
 
31
of the money, however by granting reasonable damages, she can 
be compensated to some extent. Thus this Court has to fairly and 
justly determine the compensation by taking in view all the facts 
and circumstances of the matter at hand. The trial Court without 
properly appreciating the material evidence  on the record has 
granted lesser amount of damages to the appellant/plaintiff as 
Rs.50,00,000/- which is liable to be enhanced to Rs.1,00,00,000/-.  
15. 
Resultantly, this appeal [No.70634/2023] is hereby 
allowed, the judgment & decree dated 12.09.2023 passed by the 
trial Court is modified in the manner that the damages granted by 
the trial Court as Rs.50,00,000/- are enhanced to the tune of 
Rs.1,00,00,000/- (rupees one crore) with costs throughout. The 
connected appeal [No.74489/2023] filed by the respondent/ 
defendant is hereby dismissed.
