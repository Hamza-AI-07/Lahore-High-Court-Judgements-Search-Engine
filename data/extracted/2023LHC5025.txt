learned trial court also referred Capital Sentence Reference 
No.23 of 2019 (The State. Vs. Asad Ali) to confirm the death 
sentence awarded to the appellant-Asad Ali. The matters arising 
from the same judgment of the learned trial court are being 
disposed of through this consolidated judgment. 
3. 
 
Briefly, the prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex. 
PC/3) lodged on the application (Ex. PC) of Mazhar Iqbal (PW-4)-
the complainant is that on 18.06.2018 at about 3:30 p.m, wife of the 
complainant sent her daughter, namely, Madhia Rani (the alleged 
victim) aged about 8/8 ½ years to a shop to purchase articles and 
when Madhia Rani (the alleged victim) did not return to home, the 
complainant along with Riaz Ahmad and Nasar Hussain, 
prosecution witnesses went in search of Madhia Rani (the alleged 
victim). When they reached near the house of Yaqoob Tarkhan, 
they heard crying of Madhia Rani (the alleged victim). They 
entered the house and saw the accused-Asad Ali, was committing 
zina with Madhia Rani (the alleged victim). The complainant and 
prosecution witnesses apprehended the accused at the spot and 
handed it over to the police. Hence, this case.  
4. 
 
After the case registration, Talat Yasmeen, Inspector 
(PW-10)-the investigating officer, found the accused guilty of the 
offense charged against him. The report under Section 173 of 
Cr.P.C was prepared and sent to court, and the learned trial court 
formally charge-sheeted the appellant on 01.08.2018, to which he 
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In support of its version, the 
prosecution produced as many as ten (10) witnesses. The appellant 
was also examined in terms of Section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he 
neither opted to appear as his own witness in terms of Section 
340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any defence evidence.  
5. 
 
After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence 
available on record in light of arguments advanced from both 

C.S.R No.23 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.17007 of 2019 
 
 
3
sides, the learned trial court found the prosecution version proved 
beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which resulted in the 
appellant’s conviction in the afore-stated terms. 
6. 
 
We have heard the arguments advanced by the learned 
counsel for the parties and have minutely perused the record on 
the file. 
7. 
 
The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that 
there is an apparent conflict between the medical and the ocular 
evidence, which creates serious doubt in the prosecution's case. 
To bolster this contention, reference has been made to the 
statement of Madhia Rani (PW-5), the victim, where she states that 
she was subjected to rape, but according to the Forensic DNA and 
Serologist report (Exh.PF/1-2), she was not subjected to rape. 
Madhia Rani (PW-5), the victim, submitted that when she was taken 
to the hospital, she was examined by Dr. Sadaf Aslam (PW-9), who 
stated that on 18.06.2018, she had examined Madhia, the victim, 
brought by lady constable Sobia Majeed 916/LC (PW-2) for 
medical examination. Dr. Sadaf Aslam (PW-9), after a medical 
examination of the victim, made the following remarks: -  
“---on her general examination, victim was 
weak by physique, well oriented, confused. 
An overage height and weight. No external 
injury on her body---On her internal 
examination, swelling of Vulva, vaginal tear, 
hyperemia, ruptured of hymen present--”  
Dr. Sadaf Aslam (PW-9) also deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“---The MLR No.32SA/18 consisted upon four 
pages is, Ex. P.E/1-5 which bears my 
signature and report of the chemical 
examiner comprising upon two pages 
Ex.PF/1-2. According to my opinion on the 
basis of examination, the victim Madhia was 
raped--”  

C.S.R No.23 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.17007 of 2019

The prosecution declared Dr. Sadaf Aslam (PW-9) hostile, as she 
was suppressing who accompanied the victim and the medical 
examination history. Law is well settled regarding the credibility of 
the deposition of a witness declared hostile during examination-in-
chief in the trial. The evidence of such a prosecution witness 
cannot be rejected merely because such witness has been 
declared hostile by the prosecution. Still, the same can be 
accepted to the extent his statement is dependable on scrutiny 
thereof. Learned DDPP cross-examined her. She (PW-9) deposed 
during cross-examination that: - 
“---It is correct that victim Madhia Rani was 
already admitted in the hospital when I 
examined her. No treatment was given to 
the victim before her examination by me. 
After examination the victim, the stitching of 
victim at her vagina was made by Consultant 
Doctor Saima Nasir. The victim was admitted 
on slip No.15711-E/18. At the time of her 
examination, victim was confused but not 
fainted. I have asked the details from the 
victim but she never told, however, mother 
of victim told the details. According to my 
history given, I have not written about the 
incapacity of victim regarding the narration 
of occurrence. However, the victim was in 
confused condition---” 
The facts that come on the record through cross-examination 
conducted by the DDPP were not denied by the defence. From the 
above evidence, it is not feasible to state with certainty that there is 
any conflict between the medical and the ocular proof. The 
deposition of Dr. Sadaf Aslam (PW-9) reveals that the victim was 
raped. As far as the contention of the learned counsel for the 
appellant that the Forensic DNA and Serologist report (Exh.PF/1-2) 
about the appellant has come negative is concerned, Dr. Sadaf 
Aslam (PW-9) had mentioned in column No.5, related to “evidence 
collected,” in MLC (Exh. PE), of the victim that the one green and 
white shirt and one yellow and light green trouser were handed 

C.S.R No.23 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.17007 of 2019 
 
 
5
over to Sobia Majeed 916/LC (PW-2). Dr. Sadaf Aslam (PW-9) had 
not mentioned in MLC (Exh. PE) that she prepared the sealed 
parcels of the clothes of the victim and three vaginal, pri-vagina, 
and cervical swabs. When preparing the Medico Legal Certificate, 
the doctor had not mentioned that sealed parcels were handed 
over to the lady constable.  It could be the reason for the negative 
DNA report. Even otherwise, Dr. Sadaf Aslam (PW-9), who had 
examined the victim, has deposed that on her internal 
examination, swelling of the vulva, vaginal tear, hyperemia, and 
rupture of the Hyman were observed by her (PW-9). Clothes were 
blood-stained. This testimony of Dr. Sadaf Aslam (PW-9) shows that 
bleeding had occurred because of the rape.  
8.  
 
It is a settled principle of law that a conflict or 
contradiction between the ocular and the medical evidence has to 
be direct and material, and only then can the same be pleaded. 
Even where it is so, the Court has to examine which of the two is 
more reliable, corroborated by other prosecution evidence and 
gives the most balanced happening of events as per the 
prosecution's case. Madhia Rani (PW-5), the victim, was eight 
years old at the time of occurrence, while she was 8-1/2 years old 
when her statement was recorded in the Court. After the Court was 
convinced that she was competent to make the statement, the same 
was recorded. During the examination-in-chief, the victim, Madhia 
Rani (PW-5), deposed that: -  
“---Stated that on 18.6.2018 at about 
3:30 p.m, my mother sent me to a shop 
in order to purchase articles. Where 
the accused Asad Suhail present 
before the court met me in the street 
and asked me that his mother was 
calling me. Then accused took me to 
his house where his mother and sister 
were not present. He took me into a 
room where he forcible put off my 
“shalwar” and committed Zina-Bil-

Jabar with me. Responding to my hue 
and cry, my father Mazhar Iqbal, Nasar 
Hussain and Riaz Ahmad PWs passing 
through the street came there and saw 
the occurrence. They all apprehended 
the 
accused. 
I 
was 
medically 
examined. I.O also recorded my 
statement.” 
We must notice that despite a lengthy cross-examination, she 
stood to her statement and did not cast any doubt on the statement 
made by her examination-in-chief. Madhia Rani (PW-5), the victim, 
during cross-examination, reaffirmed that: - 
“---on the day of occurrence, my mother 
sent me to purchase eatable for my brother 
Ibrahim and thread rolls. My mother gave 
me Rs.50/-to purchase above mentioned 
from the shop of Hafiz which is on the 
eastern side from our house---There is no 
shop near the house of Asad. All accused 
present in the court. The house of Asad 
accused is situated on the back side of our 
house. I did not purchase any item from the 
shop of Hafiz. Nobody met me on the way 
towards shop. The Rs.50/- slipped away 
(lost) somewhere---My mother along took 
me to the hospital after the occurrence at 
about 7:00 p.m. The house of place of 
occurrence was not bolted or locked from 
the inside---At about 5:00 p.m., from the day 
of occurrence, my family took me to my 
house. Police recorded my statement at 
hospital. Nasar PW is my real paternal 
uncle---” 
 An 8-1/2-year-old girl could hardly be aware of the technicalities 
of the law about an offense of sexual assault. The victim, Madhia 
Rani (PW-5), stood firm in her statements. The defence reaffirmed 
the incident. The incident was confirmed from the cross-
examination of Mazhar Iqbal (PW-4) and Riaz Ahmad (PW-6) by the 
defence. Mazhar Iqbal (PW-4), complainant and father of the 
victim, during cross-examination, reaffirmed that: -

“---I was present at my house when Madhia 
Rani victim left the house for shop in order to 
purchase eatable for her brother Ibrahim 
and thread rolls from the Hafiz shop. Her 
mother gave her Rs.50/-. The shop of Hafiz is 
situated towards western side from our 
house---The house of the accused is on the 
backside of our house which is towards 
eastern side from our house. There is no 
shop near the house of Asad Ali accused 
present in the court---We started search of 
Madhia Rani victim/PW at about 4:00 p.m. 
My brother Nasar PW is Rickshaw driver. He 
normally uses his rickshaw from morning to 
evening. 
However, 
on 
the 
day

Similarly, 
Riaz 
Ahmad 
(PW-6), 
during 
cross-examination, 
reaffirmed that: - 
“---There is grocery shop situated near the 
house of complainant owned by Hafiz. House 
of accused is not situated in between shop of 
Hafiz and house of complainant---At time of 
occurrence, I was present in the house of 
complainant wherefrom we started the 
search of victim Madhia Rani. I along with 
Nasar, Mazhar complainant and other house 
mates of the house were present in the 
house of complainant. I visited the house of 
complainant 
in 
connection 
with 
Eid 
celebrations ten minutes prior to the 
occurrence. Firstly, we proceeded towards 
the grocery shop of Hafiz in search of victim, 
then we searched the victim in the adjacent 
streets and after that we proceeded in the 
street of house of occurrence. Victim Madhia 
Rani left her house in my presence. We 
search the victim for about 30 minutes. The 
outer door and the door of room of place of 
occurrence were neither locked nor bolted. 
However, doors were shut at that time,. 
Many persons gathered there on our hue 
and cry. First of all, Rai Fida Hussain, then 
nephew of Mazhar complainant whose 
names are not known to me then Sarwar, Rai 
Javed, Zubair and others whose names are 
not known to me came there. I along with 
the help of Mazhar and Nasar Pws caught 
hold the accused. Till the arrival of police I 
and Nasar PW caught hold the accused. The 
police party firstly responding arrived at the 
place of occurrence, comprised upon male 
police personnel. Lady police came at the 
place of occurrence after about two hours 
later on. Before the arrival of lady police, the 
accused was shifted to the police station by 
the first police party. During this time, 
Mazhar complainant alone went to the police 
station for registration of FIR. The victim was 
shifted to the hospital in the company of her 
mother by the first police party from the 
place of occurrence---I along with my wife 
visited the house of complainant about one 
year prior to the occurrence. I had been 

C.S.R No.23 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.17007 of 2019 
 
 
9
oftenly visiting the house of complainant in 
the evening. Two/three days after the 
occurrence, I again visited the house of 
complainant, I alongwith my wife never 
visited the house of complainant after the 
occurrence. Five/seven days prior to the 
occurrence, Mazhar Hussain complainant 
visited my house---” 
Cross-examination of these witnesses thus established the 
appellant's involvement in the commission of the heinous crime of 
rape with a child of 8-1/2 years. The defence could not elicit any 
material from the cross-examination of these witnesses for 
doubting their version of the incident. Even the evidence 
regarding the role of rape is evident and precise and shows that 
Mazhar Iqbal (PW-4), the complainant, Madhia Rani (PW-5), the 
victim, and Riaz Ahmad (PW-6), are witnesses of truth. The 
prosecution version is entirely in tune with the medical evidence. 
We have no reason to disbelieve the clear and consistent version 
of the above eyewitness. Where the eyewitness account is credible 
and trustworthy, a negative DNA report (Exh. PF) pointing to 
alternative possibilities may not be accepted as conclusive. Rape 
is a crime not only against human dignity but also against society 
as a whole. In our culture, the family members of a minor girl, the 
victim of sexual assault, would rather suffer silently than falsely 
implicate somebody. Any statement of rape is an extremely 
humiliating experience for the family members of the girls and 
women. Until she/they is/are a victim of sex crime, she/they would 
not blame anyone but the real culprit. While appreciating the 
victim's evidence, the courts must never forget that no self-
respecting Father would put her daughter’s honor at stake by 
falsely alleging the commission of rape on her. Ordinarily, a look 
for corroboration of her testimony is unnecessary and uncalled for. 
No doubt, the DNA is negative, but it is evident from the testimony 
of the victim-Madhia Rani (PW-5), that she not only identified the 

C.S.R No.23 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.17007 of 2019 
 
 
10
accused but also proved how the incident had occurred. The 
statement of a witness must be read in its entirety. Reading a line 
out of context is not an accepted canon of appreciation of 
evidence. During cross-examination, Muhammad Sohara S.I. (PW-
8) reaffirmed that the accused-appellant was arrested from the 
place of occurrence. In the present case, the appellant had been 
provided ample opportunity to explain the incriminating evidence 
produced against him by the prosecution during cross-
examination, but he reaffirmed the prosecution case. In light of the 
above, we have no hesitation in concluding that we find no merit in 
the contention raised on behalf of the appellant about 
discrepancies in the medical and ocular evidence. 
9.  
 
Indeed, the statement of Madhia Rani (PW-5) was not 
recorded as per the provision of Section 164 of the Cr.P.C. Law 
does not require that a statement of a witness must be recorded 
under Section 164, Cr.P.C. However, a statement recorded Under 
Section 164 Cr.P.C. can never be used as substantive evidence of 
the truth of the facts. Still, it may be used for contradiction or 
corroboration of the witness who made it. As such, we hold that the 
absence of any statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. has not caused 
any prejudice to the accused or caused any miscarriage of justice. 
Besides, we have seen that the evidence of the victim is free from 
any doubt, and she did not deviate from her statement before the 
investigating officer soon after the occurrence. Moreover, it is a 
settled principle that investigation flaws should not cause 
prejudice to the rights of the sexually harassed victims, and 
accordingly, hyper-technicalities are to be avoided.  
10.   
Given the above circumstances, we have concluded 
that the prosecution has proved its case against the appellant 
beyond any shadow of a doubt. The appellant's guilt stands fully 
established from the evidence on the record. The learned trial 

C.S.R No.23 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.17007 of 2019 
 
 
11
court rightly held the appellant guilty of the offence committed by 
him. The order of his conviction is, therefore, maintained. We have 
observed the factors which have persuaded us not to uphold the 
capital sentence of the appellant. The appellant, no doubt, has 
committed a heinous offense. Hence, the statement of the child 
witness is held to be mitigating circumstances. 
11.   
Based on the grounds discussed hereinabove, we 
believe that mitigating circumstances exist about the quantum of 
the appellant's sentence. Therefore, we believe the death sentence 
awarded to the appellant is quite harsh. It is the well-recognized 
principle that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt as 
an extenuating circumstance while deciding his question of 
sentence. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan holds it in the 
case titled “Dilawar Hussain v. The State” (2013 SCMR 1582) in 
which the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed on 
page 1590 as under: - 
“---It has neither been the mandate of law nor 
the dictates of this court as to what quantum of 
mitigation 
is 
required 
for 
awarding 
imprisonment for life rather even an iota 
towards the mitigation is sufficient to justify 
the lesser sentence. According to our 
estimation even a single stance providing 
mitigation or extenuating circumstance would 
be sufficient to award lesser punishment as an 
abundant caution. In such circumstances, if 
the court is satisfied that there are certain 
reasons due to which death sentence is not 
warranted, the court has no other option but 
to improve second sentence of imprisonment 
for life while extending benefit of the 
extenuating circumstances to the convict in a 
just and fair manner---.” 
12.   
In these circumstances, the appeal bearing No.17007 of 
2019, filed by the appellant, Asad Ali, son of Muhammad Yaqoob, 
is dismissed. However, his (the appellant) death sentence is 

C.S.R No.23 of 2019, 
Crl. Appeal No.17007 of 2019 
 
 
12
converted into rigorous imprisonment for life. The benefit of 
Section 382 (b) of Cr.P.C. is also extended to the appellant.  
13.    
Capital Sentence Reference No.23 of 2019 forwarded 
by the learned trial court for confirmation of the sentence of death 
inflicted upon the convict fails, which is answered in Negative.
