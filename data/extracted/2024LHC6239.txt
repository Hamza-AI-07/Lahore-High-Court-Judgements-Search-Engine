of Muhammad Bakhsh. We intend to dispose of the Criminal Appeal 
No.312-J of 2021 and Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 through this single 
judgment. 
3. 
Precisely, the necessary facts of the prosecution case, as narrated by 
Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) , the eye witness of the case, are as under:- 
 
 
“States that on 25.11.2014, I alongwith my father Taj Muhammad 
complainant (since dead) and Haji Muhammad were sitting at the 
brokerage (Arhat) of Sajid Hussain son of Sadiq Muhammad, in front of 
that brokerage (Arhat) there was brokerage (Arhat) of Sajjad Hussain 
alias Punnu. At about 1.45 p.m, Riaz accused armed with Kalashnikov 
present in court, Zaffar alias Allah Ditta (already tried) armed with 
Kalashnikov by one motorcycle, while Sultan, Ameen (already tried) both 
armed with Kalashnikovs by second motorcycle, Talib Hussain and 
Ameer Bakhsh (already tried) both armed with Kalashnikov by third 
motorcycle came on brokerage (Arhat) of Punnu Khan. They alighted 
from their respective motorcycles and Ameer Bakhsh went on back of 
brokerage (Arhat). In our view, Riaz Hussain accused made a fire with 
his Kalashnikov which hit Sajjad Hussain alias Punnu khan on right side 
of his /chest. Sajjad Hussain alias Punnu khan tried to stand up from the 
cot but Talib Hussain made fire from his Kalashnikov which hit Sajjad 
Hussain alias Punnu Khan on his ribs under left arm pit. Zaffar alias 
Allah Ditta made fire shot with Kalashnikov which hit him on right side 
of his belly. Sultan made a fire from his Kalashnikov which hit on his 
right bicep. Riaz accused made second fire with his Kalashnikov which 
hit him on his right thigh. Ameen made fire shot from his Kalashnikov 
which hit on outer side of right thigh. Talib Hussain made a fire from his 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
3 
 
 
Kalashnikov which hit on little above of right knee. Ameer Bakhsh 
accused who was behind the brokerage (Arhat) kept on making aerial 
firing continuously. When I, my father and Haji Muhammad tried to go to 
the place of occurrence, all the accused persons threatened us of dire 
consequences. Sajjad Hussain alias Punnu Khan fell down on the ground 
while all the accused persons while making aerial firing fled away from 
the place of occurrence by their motorcycles towards northern side. On 
hearing the firing neighbors, shop keepers and passersby attracted to the 
place of occurrence. We got boarded Sajjad Hussain alias Punnu khan on 
a private Dalla and brought him to hospital Fazilpur where he succumbed 
to the injuries. Motive behind the occurrence is that there was an FIR of 
murder of brother of Riaz Hussain accused present in court against 
persons of 5/6 tribes including our relatives and due to that grudge all the 
accused persons committed the murder of Sajjad Hussain alias Punnu 
Khan due to suspicion that Sajjad Hussain alias Punnu was involved in 
the said murder case. Police came at the place of occurrence and collected 
blood stained soil vide recovery memo Ex.P-G after making into sealed 
parcel. I.0 also collected 11 crime empties (P-6/1-11) vide recovery 
memo Ex.P-H and blood stained cot P-7 vide recovery memo Ex.P.J. I 
and Haji Muhammad attested the above mentioned recovery memos by 
signing the same. I.O recorded my statement under section 161 Cr.P.C in 
this regard.” 
 
4.     After the formal investigation of the case report under section 173 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted before the learned trial 
court and the accused was sent to face trial. The learned trial court framed 
the charge against the accused on 05.11.2020, to which the accused pleaded 
not guilty and claimed trial. 
 
5. 
The prosecution in order to prove its case got statements of as many 
as fourteen witnesses recorded. The ocular account of the case was 
furnished by Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji Muhammad (PW-14). Akhtar 
Abbas 509/HC (PW-2) stated that on 25.11.2014, he escorted the dead body 
of the deceased to the hospital and received the last worn clothes of the 
deceased from the Medical Officer after the post mortem examination of the 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021

dead body of the deceased. Wahid Bakhsh, ASI (PW-3) stated that on 
25.11.2014, he recorded the formal F.I.R. (Exh.PB). Tariq Raheem 1040/C 
(PW-4) stated that on 26.03.2015, he made his report (Exh.PC/1) upon the 
non-bailable warrants of arrest (Exh.PC) issued of the appellant and on 
29.03.2015, he pasted the copy of the proclamation (Exh.PD) at the relevant 
places. Javed Iqbal 121/C (PW-5) stated that on 26.07.2020, the appellant 
got recovered Kalashnikov rifle (P-4) and five live bullets (P-5/1-5).  
Ghulam Qasim, Patwari (PW-9) prepared the scaled site plan of the place of 
occurrence (Exh.PL). Mahmood Ahmad 1142/HC (PW-11) stated that on 
26.07.2020, Ashiq Hussain, SI (PW-10) handed over to him a sealed parcel 
said to contain the recovered Kalashnikov rifle and empties and on 
14.08.2020, he handed over the said sealed parcel to Ashiq Hussain, SI (PW-
10) for its onward transmission to the office of the Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore .  Muhammad Usman (PW-12) stated that on 25.11.2014, 
he identified the dead body of the deceased at the time of its post mortem 
examination and the Medical Officer handed over the last worn clothes of 
the deceased to the police official after post mortem examination.  Kazim 
Hussain, SI (PW-6)   investigated the case from 25.11.2014 till 12.12.2014 
and detailed the facts of the investigation as conducted by him in his 
statement before the learned trial court.  Ashiq Hussain, SI (PW-10)   
investigated the case from 12.07.2020 till 15.09.2020, arrested the appellant 
on 12.07.2020, and detailed the facts of the investigation as conducted by 
him in his statement before the learned trial court.       
6. 
The prosecution also got Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7) examined, who 
on 25.11.2014 was posted as Medical Officer at RHC, Fazilpur and on the 
same day conducted the postmortem examination of the dead body of Sajjad

Hussain alias Pannu son of Allan Khan (deceased). Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-
7), on examining the dead body of Sajjad Hussain alias Pannu son of Allan 
Khan (deceased) observed as under:- 
“  EXTERNAL EXAMINATION.

CONCLUSION.

7.    
On 09.04.2021, the learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up 
the prosecution witnesses as being unnecessary and closed the prosecution 
evidence after tendering in evidence the reports of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore (Exh. PM, Exh.PN), copy of F.I.R. 21 of 2011 (Exh.PO) 
and copy of F.I.R. No. 146 of 2021 (Mark-A) . 
8. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court 
examined the appellant namely Riaz Hussain son of Muhammad Bakhsh  
under section 342 Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question why this case 
against you and why the P.W.s have deposed against you, he replied that he 
had been involved in the case falsely and was innocent. The appellant 
namely Riaz Hussain son of Muhammad Bakhsh opted not to get himself 
examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. and did not adduce any evidence in 
his defence.

9. 
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Rajanpur convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to above.   
10. 
 The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant precisely was 
that the whole case was fabricated and false and the prosecution remained 
unable to prove the facts in issue and did not produce any unimpeachable, 
admissible, and relevant evidence. Learned counsel for the appellant further 
contended that the story of the prosecution mentioned in the statements of 
the witnesses, on the face of it, was highly improbable. Learned counsel for 
the appellant further contended that the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses were not worthy of any reliance. The learned counsel for the 
appellant also submitted that the recovery of the Kalashnikov rifle (P-4) was 
full of procedural defects, of no legal worth and value, and was the result of 
fake proceedings. The learned counsel for the appellant also argued that the 
appellant had been involved in the occurrence only on suspicion. The 
learned counsel for the appellant finally submitted that the prosecution had 
totally failed to prove the case against the accused beyond the shadow of a 
doubt.   
 
11. 
On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with 
the learned counsel for the complainant contended that the prosecution has 
proved its case beyond the shadow of doubt by producing independent 
witnesses. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned 
counsel for the complainant, further argued that the deceased died as a result 
of injuries suffered at the hands of the appellant namely Riaz Hussain. The 
learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the 
complainant, further contended that the medical evidence also corroborated 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
7 
 
 
the statements of Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji Muhammad (PW-14) . 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for 
the complainant, further argued that the recovery of the Kalashnikov rifle (P-
4) from the appellant namely Riaz Hussain also corroborated the ocular 
account. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned 
counsel for the complainant further contended that there was no occasion for 
the prosecution witnesses, who were related to the deceased, to substitute the 
real offender with the innocent in this case. Lastly, the learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the complainant 
prayed for the rejection of the appeal. 
 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned 
counsel for the complainant, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General and 
with their able assistance perused the record and evidence recorded during 
the trial. 
13. 
The whole prosecution case revolves around the statements of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji Muhammad  
(PW-14), the eyewitnesses of the occurrence. The relationship of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji Muhammad 
(PW-14) , with the deceased is on record. It is also an admitted aspect of the 
prosecution case that the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-
13) and Haji Muhammad (PW-14), were  not the residents of the place of 
occurrence or any place near the same. According to the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji Muhammad (PW-14), 
the occurrence took place at the shop of the deceased which was at a 
distance from the houses of the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
8 
 
 
(PW-13) and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14). The prosecution witness namely 
Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  during cross-examination explained as under:- 
“My house is at a distance of 4/5 kms away from place of occurrence. 
House of Haji Muhammad is at a distance of 1-km from place of 
occurrence whereas same house is at a distance of 5/6 kms from my 
house.” (emphasis supplied). 
The prosecution witness namely Haji Muhammad (PW-14) during cross-
examination admitted as under:- 
“My house is one kilometer away from the place of occurrence. It 
takes half an hour to reach from my house to place of occurrence by 
foot.”(emphasis supplied)  
The above-referred portions of the cross-examination of the prosecution 
witnesses reflect that the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-
13) and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14),  can be validly termed as “chance 
witnesses” and therefore were under a bounden duty to provide a convincing 
reason for their presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence 
and were also under a duty to prove their presence by producing some 
physical proof of the same. We have noted with grave concern that the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  
(PW-14), failed miserably to provide any consistent evidence as to the 
reason for their arrival at the place of occurrence and their presence at the 
place of occurrence when the same was taking place. Both the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji Muhammad (PW-14) did 
not even offer any explanation for their presence at the place of occurrence, 
at the time of occurrence. Moreover, according to the statements of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
9 
 
 
(PW-14), they were sitting at the shop of one Sajid Hussain when the 
occurrence took place and witnessed the same from the said place, however, 
according to the statement of Kazim Hussain, (PW-6), the Investigating 
Officer of the case , the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-
13)  and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14) were not present at the shop of one Sajid 
Hussain when the occurrence took place.  The prosecution witness namely 
Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) in his statement before the learned trial court, stated 
as under:- 
“States that on 25.11.2014, I alongwith my father Taj Muhammad 
complainant (since dead) and Haji Muhammad were sitting at the 
brokerage (Arhat) of Sajid Hussain son of Sadiq Muhammad, in front of 
that brokerage (Arhat) there was brokerage (Arhat) of Sajjad Hussain alias 
Punnu.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Haji Muhammad (PW-14), in his statement 
before the learned trial court claimed as under:- 
“States that on 25.11.2014, I alongwith Taj Muhammad complainant (since 
dead), and Ghulam Qadir were sitting at the brokerage (Arhat) of Sajid 
Hussain son of Sadiq Muhammad and in front of that brokerage (Arhat) 
there was brokerage (Arhat) of Sajjad Hussain alias Punnu. ” (emphasis 
supplied)  
Contradicting the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and 
Haji Muhammad  (PW-14),  Kazim Hussain, (PW-6), the Investigating 
Officer of the case ,  stated during cross-examination as under:- 
“PWs were present in the premises of brokerage (ARHAT) of Sajjad deceased 
at the time of occurrence. At the time of occurrence, PWs were not present 
at the brokerage (ARHAT) of Sajid Chandia.”(emphasis supplied)  

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
10 
 
 
In this manner, the claim of the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir 
(PW-13) and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14) with regard to the place of their 
presence at the time of occurrence was exposed to be false by the statement 
of  Kazim Hussain, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case. It is also 
a fact that the prosecution witness namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) was 
exposed to had made an improvement in his statement with regard to the 
presence of Haji Muhammad (PW-14) and was confronted with the said 
improvement during cross-examination and the learned trial court observed 
as under:- 
“It is incorrect to suggest that I did not get record the name of Haji 
Muhammad son of Maula Dad PW in my said previous statement as PW-
2. (It is confronted with the same where presence of Haji Muhammad 
at brokerage (ARHAT) of Sajid Hussain is not mentioned in his said 
statement whereas his presence at the place of occurrence has been 
mentioned in the same.). ”(emphasis supplied)  
Moreover, Kazim Hussain, SI (PW-6) , the Investigating Officer of the case, 
at the time of his visit to the place of occurrence, after the occurrence, did 
not observe any furniture which was being used by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14) while sitting 
at the shop of one Sajid Hussain and neither the prosecution witnesses 
namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14) pointed out 
any such furniture which they were using for sitting at the shop of the said 
one Sajid Hussain. It is also a fact that both the prosecution witnesses 
namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14) did not state 
at all as to why on the day of occurrence they were present at the shop of one 
Sajid Hussain, with whom neither they had any relationship nor any 
business. The prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
11 
 
 
Haji Muhammad (PW-14) also did not explain as to why they were not 
sitting at the shop of the deceased and had chosen to sit at the shop of one 
Sajid Hussain. It is also an admitted fact that during the course of the 
investigation, the said Sajid Hussain, at whose shop the prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji Muhammad (PW-14)   
claimed to had been present  at the time of the occurrence, never appeared 
before the Investigating Officer of the case, to verify the said claim of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  
(PW-14). The prosecution witness namely Haji Muhammad (PW-14) during 
cross-examination admitted as under:- 
“Ashiq Thathal, his son, Sajid Chandia and two or three labourers of 
other casts were present at that time and near to the place of occurrence.” 
We have also noted with grave concern that neither in column No.4 of the 
inquest report (Exh. P.K/4.) nor at page 4 of the inquest report (Exh. P.K/4.), 
the names of the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and 
Haji Muhammad  (PW-14), were mentioned as being the persons present at 
the place of occurrence. In column No.4 of the inquest report (Exh. P.K/4.) 
names of Sadiq Muhammad and Muhammad Usman have been mentioned, 
whereas at page 4 of the inquest report (Exh. P.K/4.), the names of Ihtsham 
and Abdul Hae Khan have been mentioned. This fact also fully denudes the 
fact that at the time of the preparation of the inquest report (Exh. P.K/4.), the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji Muhammad  
(PW-14), were not present at the RHC, Fazilpur and therefore, their names 
were also not mentioned in the same. We have thus reached an irresistible 
conclusion that the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  
and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14) ,  failed to prove the reason for their leaving 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
12 
 
 
their houses on the day of occurrence and their arrival at the place of 
occurrence and the same remained claims unproved, entailing failure of the 
prosecution witnesses to prove the reasons for their departure from their 
residences and their subsequent arrival at the place of occurrence. The 
prosecution was under a bounden duty to establish that the occurrence had 
indeed taken place when the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir 
(PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14), had arrived at the place of 
occurrence and the failure to prove any reason for the prosecution witnesses 
namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14) ,  to have 
proceeded from their houses to the place of occurrence and their presence at 
the place of occurrence has vitiated our trust in the prosecution witnesses 
namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14) . In this 
respect, reliance is placed on the case of “Muhammad Rafiq v. State” (2014 
SCMR 1698) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan rejected the 
claim of witnesses who lived one kilometre away from the occurrence, but 
on the day of occurrence stated to be present near the spot as they working 
as labourers, inasmuch as they failed to give any detail of the projects they 
were working on. Reliance is also placed on the case of “Usman alias Kaloo 
v. State” (2017 SCMR 622) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
held that the ocular account of the incident had been furnished by Zahoor 
Ahmad, Ghulam Farid and Manzoor Ahmed witnesses in the said case, who 
were all residents of some other houses and were not the inmates of the 
house wherein the occurrence had taken place and therefore the said 
eyewitnesses being, chance witnesses, were declared not worthy of reliance. 
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Nasrullah alias Nasro v. The State” 
(2017 SCMR 724). 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
13 
 
 
 
14. 
       Another grave flaw of the prosecution case is that none of the 
persons who had their shops near or around the place of occurrence appeared 
either during the investigation of the case or before the learned trial court in 
support of the prosecution case. It was admitted by the prosecution witness 
namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) that their cousin namely Shakeel used to 
work at the shop of the deceased but he was not produced as a witness in the 
case. The prosecution witness namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13), during cross-
examination,  admitted as under:- 
“ My cousin Shakeel used to remain at brokerage (Arhat). Shakeel was 
present on day of occurrence.” 
As mentioned above, the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-
13)  and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14) admitted that there were shops of other 
persons at the place of occurrence and the said persons were also present at 
their shops, however, none of those who had their shops at and around  the 
place of occurrence either appeared before the Investigating Officer of the 
case or before the learned trial court. The failure of the prosecution to 
produce the said persons has convinced us that had they been produced 
before the learned trial court, they would not have supported the prosecution 
case. Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 provides that if any 
evidence available with the parties is not produced then it shall be presumed 
that had that evidence been produced, the same would have been gone 
against the party producing the same. Illustration (g) of the said Article 129 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 reads as under:- 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
14 
 
 
“(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced 
would, if produced, be unfavourable to the person who 
withholds it.” 
The Investigating Officer was under a binding duty to collect evidence and 
his failure has to be taken as a circumstance belying the prosecution case. 
The purpose of the trial is the discovery of truth. As long as men keep lying, 
the only causality would be the reality. The prosecution case suffers from 
inherent defects which are irreconcilable as they are. The guidance is sought 
from the binding decisions of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case 
titled Nadeem alias Nanha alias Billa Sher Vs. The State (2010 SCMR 949) 
wherein it has been observed as under:- 
“….further that no independent witness of the locality where the 
incident took place, a ‘Bazar’ joined, made case of the prosecution 
doubtful. It is cardinal principle of Criminal Jurisprudence that 
any genuine doubt arising out of the circumstances of the case 
should be extended to the accused as of the right and not as 
concession. It is difficult to say that prosecution has proved its 
case beyond shadow of doubt.” 
 
 
15.       Another aspect of the case raising our doubt over the presence the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  
(PW-14),  at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence is the fact that 
they never reported the matter to the police and Kazim Hussain, SI (PW-6)  
the Investigating Officer of the case, himself reached at the RHC, Fazilpur 
and recorded the oral statement (Exh.P.B/1.) of Taj Muhammad(since dead), 
the complainant of the case. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
already enunciated the principle of law that when the F.I.R of the case is not 
lodged at the Police Station, a conclusion can be drawn that the F.I.R. had 
been registered after pondering and inquiry at the spot. The august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Abdul Jabbar alias Jabbari v. The State” 
(2017 SCMR 1155) has observed as under: 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
15 
 
 
“An F.I.R. in respect of the incident in issue had not been lodged at 
the local Police Station giving rise to an inference that the F.I.R. had 
been chalked out after deliberations and preliminary investigation at 
the spot.” 
16. 
We have also noted that it was the prosecution claim that the oral 
statement (Exh. P.B/1.) of Taj Muhammad, complainant of the case (since 
dead) was recorded at the RHC, Fazilpur by Kazim Hussain, SI (PW-6) at 
02.30 p.m, after the dead body of the deceased had been brought at the 
RHC, Fazilpur, however, according to the Post Mortem Examination report 
(Exh.PK) , the dead body of the deceased was brought to the hospital at 
06.00 p.m. In this manner, it is quite evident that false entry with regard to 
the time of recording of the oral statement (Exh. P.B/1.) of Taj 
Muhammad(since dead), complainant of the case,at the RHC, Fazilpur by 
Kazim Hussain, SI (PW-6) , was made and actually even the dead body of 
the deceased  had not been brought to the RHC, Fazilpur till 06.00 p.m and 
therefore, the oral statement (Exh. P.B/1.) of Taj Muhammad(since dead), 
the complainant of the case in no way could have been recorded at 02.30 
p.m.. The scrutiny of the prosecution evidence reveals that the oral statement 
(Exh. P.B/1.) of Taj Muhammad(since dead),the complainant of the case 
was neither promptly recorded nor was spontaneous nor natural, rather was a 
contrived, manufactured and compromised document.  
17. 
 We have also noted with disquiet that despite the fact that the 
occurrence took place at about 01.45 p.m. on 25.11.2014, the postmortem 
examination of the dead body of the deceased was conducted after much 
delay. According to Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7), he conducted the post 
mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased on 25.11.2014 at 
06.00 p.m. i.e. after as many as four hours and fifteen minutes after the 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
16 
 
 
death of Sajjad Hussain alias Pannu (deceased). Moreover, according to the 
entries made in the post mortem examination report (Exh. P.K.), the 
complete police papers were received by Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7) at 6.00 
p.m. on 25.11.2014. The reason which is apparent for the delayed 
conducting of the post mortem examination of the dead body of Sajjad alias 
Pannu  is that by that time the details of the occurrence were not known and 
the said time was used not only to procure the attendance of the witnesses 
but also to fashion out  a false narrative of the occurrence. No explanation 
was offered to justify the said delay in conducting the post mortem 
examination and the delay in submitting the complete papers. This clearly 
establishes that the witnesses claiming to have seen the occurrence were not 
present at the time of occurrence and the delay in the post mortem 
examination was used to procure their attendance and formulate a dishonest 
account, after consultation and planning. It has been repeatedly held by the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan that such delay in the post mortem 
examination is reflective of the absence of witnesses and the sole purpose of 
causing such delay is to procure the presence of witnesses and to further 
advance a false narrative to involve any person. The august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in the case of “Khalid alias Khalidi and two others vs. The 
State” (2012 SCMR 327) has held as under: 
“The incident in the instant case took place at 2.00 a.m, F.I.R. was 
recorded at 4/5 a.m, Doctor Muhammad Pervaiz medically examined the 
injured person at 4.00 a.m. but conducted the post mortem examination of 
the deceased at 3.00 p.m i.e. after about ten hours, which fact clearly 
shows that the F.I.R. was not lodged at the given time”. 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Mian SOHAIL 
AHMED and others vs. The State and others” (2019 SCMR 956) has held 
as under: 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
17 
 
 
“According to the Doctor (PW-10), who did the post-mortem examination, 
the dead-body of the deceased was brought to the mortuary at 11:15 a.m. 
on 01.9.2006 and the post-mortem examination took place at 12 noon after 
a delay of 15 hours. This delay in the post-mortem examination, when the 
occurrence was promptly reported at 8:45 p.m. and formal F.I.R. was 
registered at 9.00 p.m. on 31.8.2006 gives rise to an inference that the 
incident was not reported as stated by the prosecution” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “MUHAMMAD 
RAFIQUE alias FEEQA vs. The State” (2019 SCMR 1068) has held as 
under: 
“More importantly, the only person who can medically examine the dead 
body during the said police custody of the dead body is the medical 
officer, and that too, when the same is handed over to him by the police 
for its examination. For the purposes of the present case, it is crucial to 
note that, at the time of handing over a dead body by the police to the 
medical officer, all reports prepared by the investigating officer are also 
to be handed over in order to assist in the examination of the dead body. 
10. 
Thus, once there is suspicion regarding the death of a person, the 
following essential steps follow: firstly, there is a complete chain of police 
custody of the dead body, right from the moment it is taken into custody 
until it is handed over to the relatives, or in case they are unknown, then till 
his burial; secondly, post mortem examination of a dead person cannot be 
carried out without the authorization of competent police officer or the 
magistrate; thirdly, post mortem of a deceased person can only be carried 
out by a notified government Medical Officer; and finally, at the time of 
handing over the dead body by the police to the Medical Officer, all reports 
prepared by the investigating officer are also to be handed over to the said 
medical officer to assist his examination of the dead body. 
11. 
It is usually the delay in the preparation of these police reports, 
which are required to be handed over to the medical officer along with 
the dead body, that result in the consequential delay of the post mortem 
examination of the dead person. To repel any adverse inference for such a 
delay, the prosecution has to provide justifiable reasons therefor, which in 
the present case is strikingly wanting.”  
 
18. 
We have also noticed that according to the opinion of Dr. Abdul 
Ghafoor (PW-7), who had conducted the post mortem examination of the 
dead body of the deceased, the time which had lapsed between the death of 
the deceased and the post mortem examination was only 1 ½ hours, when 
the post mortem examination was conducted at 06.00 p.m on 25.11.2014. 
The prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji 
Muhammad  (PW-14) claimed that the occurrence had taken place at about 
01.45 p.m on 25.11.2014,  the deceased had died prior to the recording of 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
18 
 
 
the oral statement (Exh. P.B/1.) of Taj Muhammad, complainant of the case 
(since dead), recorded at the RHC, Fazilpur by Kazim Hussain, SI (PW-6) at 
02.30 p.m on 25.11.2014, however, as is apparent from the entries of the 
Post Mortem Examination report (Exh.PK), in the opinion of Dr. Abdul 
Ghafoor (PW-7) , the time of occurrence as determined by him was different 
from what was stated by the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir 
(PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14) and that too not by a small margin 
but by a huge one. According to the entries of the Post Mortem Examination 
report (Exh.PK), in the opinion of Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7), the deceased 
had died at around 04.30 p.m on 25.11.2014, whereas according to 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  
(PW-14) the deceased died before 02.30 p.m. on 25.11.2014. Moreover, 
according to the statement of Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7), the time which 
had lapsed between the injuries suffered by the deceased and his death was 
immediate. Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7) in his statement before the learned 
trial court, stated as under:- 
“Approximately duration between injury and death was immediate ” 
In this manner,the estimation of Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7) with regard to 
the time of death of the deceased also contradicts the statements of 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji Muhammad 
(PW-14) and the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and 
Haji Muhammad (PW-14) stand directly contradicted by the opinion of Dr. 
Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7) regarding the time of occurrence itself. 
19. 
We have also noted with grave concern that Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-
7), while describing the injuries observed by him on the dead body of the 
deceased, neither mentioned their locale nor their dimensions nor their kinds 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
19 
 
 
and only recorded that there were seven entry wounds caused by firearm 
found present by him on the front of the dead body of the deceased and five 
exit wounds caused by firearm found present by him on the back of the dead 
body of the deceased. In this manner, the statement of Dr. Abdul Ghafoor 
(PW-7) offers no support to the statement of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji Muhammad (PW-14). 
20.     We have also noted that according to the statements of prosecution 
witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji Muhammad (PW-14), 
the assailants had used Kalashnikov rifles to inflict injuries upon the 
deceased , whereas according to the entries of the Post Mortem Examination 
report (Exh.PK), after the post mortem examination of the dead body, Dr. 
Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7) handed over pellets recovered from the dead body of 
the deceased to the police. The prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir 
(PW-13) and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14), were confronted with this fact that 
the deceased had not suffered any injuries caused by bullets, however, both 
the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13) and Haji 
Muhammad  (PW-14) remained adamant that the deceased had suffered 
injuries caused to him by Kalashnikov rifles. The prosecution witness 
namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13), during cross-examination, claimed as 
under:- 
“Volunteers both the injuries were result of fires of Kalashnikov. Being 
witness, I say that deceased did not receive fire arm injuries by two kinds 
of weapons of offence rather received single type of weapon of offence. 
Kalashnikov. ”(emphasis supplied)  
Similarly, the prosecution witness namely Haji Muhammad (PW-14) 
claimed during cross-examination, as under:- 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
20 
 
 
“ It is incorrect to suggest that Sajjad Hussain received fires of two 
different kinds of weapons. Volunteers that he received all the fires from 
single type or (sic) kind of weapons ie. Kalashnikov. ” (emphasis 
supplied)  
Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7), during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“Pellets were recovered from the body while observing injuries no.1 and 
2” 
Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7) was also cross-examined by the learned counsel 
appearing on behalf of the prosecution witness namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-
13) and replied as under:- 
“It is correct that I have stated in my examination of instant trial that 
pellets were handed over to police but same has been stated by me 
mistakenly.”(emphasis supplied)  
Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7), however, never explained that what was the 
mistake in his statement that he had handed over pellets recovered from the 
dead body of the deceased to the police. It is also a fact that according to the 
entries of the Post Mortem Examination report (Exh.PK), pellets were 
handed over to Akhtar Abbas 509/C (PW-2). Kazim Hussain, SI (PW-6) also 
admitted during cross-examination that he had received pellets and stated as 
under:- 
“I received PMR alongwith parcels and other relevant documents. I had 
perused the same and in the column of "articles handed over to police", 
four articles ie. deadbody, documents, clothes and pellets were 
mentioned. ”(emphasis supplied)  
In this manner, the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  
and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14) were also confronted with regard to their 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
21 
 
 
claim that the assailants had used Kalashnikov rifles to inflict their injuries 
upon the deceased and Dr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-7), by not mentioning the 
dimensions of the injuries observed by him on the dead body of the 
deceased, also made a failed attempt to hide the error in the statements of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  
(PW-14) regarding the weapons used during the incident.  
21.      The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for 
the complainant have also relied upon the recovery of the Kalashnikov rifle 
(P-4), made from the appellant and have submitted that it offered sufficient 
corroboration of the ocular account of the occurrence as furnished by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  
(PW-14). The recovery of the Kalashnikov rifle (P-4) from the appellant 
namely Riaz Hussain cannot be relied upon as the Investigating Officer of 
the case did not join any witness of the locality during the recovery of the 
Kalashnikov rifle (P-4) from the appellant namely Riaz Hussain which was 
in clear violation of the provisions of the section 103 Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898. The provisions of this section, unfortunately, are 
honoured more in disuse than compliance. To appreciate it better, this 
section is being reproduced:- 
"103.--(1) Before making a search. under this chapter, the 
officer or other person about to make it shall call upon 
two or more respectable inhabitants of the locality in 
which the place to be searched is situate to attend and 
witness the search and may issue an order in writing to 
them or any of them so to do. 
Therefore the evidence of the recovery of the Kalashnikov rifle (P-4) from 
the appellant cannot be used as incriminating evidence against the appellant, 
being evidence which was obtained through illegal means and hence hit by 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
22 
 
 
the exclusionary rule of evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
the case of Muhammad Ismail and others Vs. The State ( 2017 SCMR 898) 
at page 901 has held as under:- 
“For the above mentioned recovery of weapons the prosecution had 
failed to associate any independent witness of the locality and, thus, 
the mandatory provisions of section 103, Cr.P.C. had flagrantly been 
violated in that regard.” 
We have also noted that according to the report of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore (Exh.PN/1), none of the empty shells of the bullets taken 
into possession from the place of occurrence were found to had been fired in 
the Kalashnikov rifle (P-4). The relevant portion of the report of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PN/1) reads as under:- 
“Because of differences in individual characteristics the items C1 to C11 
cartridge cases could not have been fired in the item R5 rifle ” 
The report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PN/1) that  
none of the empty shells of the bullets taken into possession from the place 
of occurrence were found to had been fired in the Kalashnikov rifle (P-4) 
allegedly recovered from the possession of the appellant also supports the 
claim of the appellant that he had been involved in the case falsely. 
22. 
 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel 
for the complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and 
submitted that it corroborated the ocular account. The motive of the 
occurrence as stated by the prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir 
(PW-13) and Haji Muhammad  (PW-14), was that before the occurrence, a 
brother of the appellant had been murdered and it was believed by the 
appellant that the deceased was involved in the said murder of the brother of 
the appellant. We have scrutinized the statements of the prosecution 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
23 
 
 
witnesses and find that the motive as alleged could not be proved. The 
prosecution witnesses namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  and Haji Muhammad  
(PW-14) admitted that they had for the first time stated that the deceased 
was also suspected of  being involved in the murder of the brother of the 
deceased while making their statements before the learned trial court . The 
prosecution witness namely Ghulam Qadir (PW-13)  during cross-
examination admitted as under:- 
“It is correct that today in my examination in chief, I have introduced 
first time that accused persons were having suspicion that Sajjad Hussain 
alias Punnu was involved in murder case mentioned in motive part.” 
(emphasis supplied)  
Kazim Hussain, SI (PW-6), the Investigating Officer of the case, also 
admitted  no evidence was brought on record with regard to the alleged 
motive of the occurrence . During cross-examination, Kasim Hussain, SI 
(PW-6) , the Investigating Officer of the case, stated as under:- 
“I did not give any opinion about the motive part and regarding 
involvement of accused Riaz. ” 
The prosecution witnesses failed to provide evidence enabling us to 
determine the truthfulness of the motive alleged and the fact that the said 
motive was so compelling that it could have led the appellant namely Riaz 
Hussain to have committed the Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased. There is an 
evocative muteness in the prosecution case with regard to the minutiae of 
motive alleged. No independent witness was produced by the prosecution to 
prove the motive as alleged. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held 
in the case of Muhammad Javed v. The State (2016 SCMR 2021) as under: 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
24 
 
 
“The said related and chance witnesses had failed to receive any 
independent corroboration inasmuch as no independent proof of 
the motive set up by the prosecution had been brought on the 
record of the case.” 
 
Even otherwise it is an admitted rule of appreciation of evidence that motive 
and recovery are only corroborative pieces of evidence and if the ocular 
account is found to be unreliable, then motive and recovery have no 
evidentiary value and lost their significance.  
 
23.      The learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for 
the complainant have also laid much premium on the abscondence of the 
appellant  namely Riaz Hussain son of Muhammad Bakhsh as proof of his 
guilt. The fact of abscondence of an accused can be used as a corroborative 
piece of evidence, which cannot be read in isolation but it has to be read 
along with the substantive piece of evidence. The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held in the case of Asadullah v. Muhammad Ali (PLD 1971 SC 
541) that both corroborative and ocular evidence are to be read together and 
not in isolation. As regards abscondence, the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held in the case of  Rasool Muhammad v. Asal Muhammad 
(1995 SCMR 1373) that abscondence is only a suspicious circumstance. In 
the case of Muhammad Sadiq v. Najeeb Ali (1995 SCMR 1632) the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan observed that abscondence itself has no value in 
the absence of any other evidence. It was also held in the case of Muhammad 
Khan v. State (1999 SCMR 1220) that abscondence of the accused can 
never remedy the defects in the prosecution case. In the case of Gul Khan v. 
State (1999 SCMR 304) it was observed by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan that  abscondence per se is not sufficient to prove the guilt but can 
be taken as a corroborative piece of evidence. In the cases of Muhammad 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
25 
 
 
Arshad v. Qasim Ali (1992 SCMR 814), Pir Badshah v. State (1985 SCMR 
2070) and Amir Gul v. State (1981 SCMR 182) it was observed that 
conviction on abscondence alone cannot be sustained. In the present case, 
the substantive piece of evidence in the shape of the ocular account has been 
disbelieved, therefore, no conviction can be based on abscondence alone. 
Reliance is also placed on the cases of “Muhammad Farooq and another Vs. 
The State” (2006 SCMR 1707) and “Nizam Khan and 2 others Vs. the 
State” (1984 SCMR 1092) and Rohtas Khan vs. The State (2010 SCMR 
566). 
 
24. 
Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in 
our minds regarding the involvement of appellant namely Riaz Hussain son 
of Muhammad Bakhsh in the present case. It is a settled principle of law that 
for giving the benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there should be so 
many circumstances rather if only a single circumstance creating reasonable 
doubt in the mind of a prudent person is available then such benefit is to be 
extended to an accused not as a matter of concession but as of right. The 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Mansha Vs. 
The State” (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the following principle: 
“Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an 
accused it is not necessary that there should be many circumstances 
creating doubt. If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable 
doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the 
accused would be entitled to the benefit of such doubt, not as a 
matter of grace and concession, but as a matter of right. It is based 
on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather 
than one innocent person be convicted". Reliance in this behalf can 
be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The State (1995 SCMR 
1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State (2008 SCMR 1221), 
Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and Muhammad 
Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749).” 
 

Murder Reference No.13 of 2021 
Criminal Appeal    No. 312-J of 2021 
26 
 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has 
been observed as infra: 
“9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is 
not a ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete 
justice. This is an established principle of law and equity that it is 
better that 100 guilty persons should let off but one innocent 
person should not suffer. As the preeminent English jurist William 
Blackstone wrote, "Better that ten guilty persons escape, than that 
one innocent suffer." Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the 
leading figures of early American history, went further arguing "it 
is better a hundred guilty persons should escape than one 
innocent person should suffer." All the contradictions noted by the 
learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of doubt on the 
prosecution's case, which entitles the petitioner to the right of 
benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for 
the accused to be afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it 
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating 
uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the benefit of the same 
must got to the petitioner. This Court in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi 
v. The State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the the earlier 
judgments of this Court has categorically held that "if a single 
circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about 
the apprehension of guilt of an accused, then he/she shall be 
entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace and concession, 
but as of right. Reference in this regard may be made to the cases 
of Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) and Ayub Masih 
v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)." The same view was reiterated 
in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court 
observed that once a single loophole is observed in a case 
presented by the prosecution, such as conflict in the ocular 
account and medical evidence or presence of eyewitnesses being 
doubtful, the benefit of such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution's 
case automatically goes in favour of an accused.” 
 
 
25.  
 For what has been discussed above Criminal Appeal No.312-J of 
2021 lodged by Riaz Hussain son of Muhammad Bakhsh (appellant) is 
allowed and the conviction and sentence of the appellant awarded by the 
learned trial court through the impugned judgment dated 13.04.2021 are 
hereby set-aside. Riaz Hussain son of Muhammad Bakhsh (appellant) is 
ordered to be acquitted by extending him the benefit of the doubt. Riaz 
Hussain son of Muhammad Bakhsh  (appellant) is in custody and is directed 
to be released forthwith if not required in any other case.
