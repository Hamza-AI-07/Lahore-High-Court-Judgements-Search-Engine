Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. This petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter referred to 
as “Constitution”) stems from order dated 15th January, 2024, whereby 
District Returning Officer, Mianwali (respondent No.2) while proceeding on 
the application of respondents No.3 and 4 changed the polling station from 
Govt. Primary School, Allah Dad Khelan Wala to the newly established 
building of Veterinary Dispensary on Dabb Road, Mianwali. 
2.  
Brief facts forming background of this constitutional petition are 
that the respondents No.3 and 4, being registered voters of Provincial 
Assembly, Constituency No.PP-87 Mianwali moved an application to 
respondent No.2 for change of polling station. On the application, a report 
was requisitioned from the Returning Officer and application was ultimately 
accepted through impugned order.

Amongst others, Election Commission is also one of the creation of 
the “Constitution”. Part-VIII of the “Constitution” deals with elections and 
its Chapter-1 is related to Chief Election Commissioner and Election 
Commission. Article 218 of the “Constitution” ordains that for the purpose of 
election to both House of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), Provincial 
Assemblies and for election of such other public offices as may be specified 
by law, there shall be a permanent Election Commission constituted in the 
manner provided therein. In the case of WORKERS’ PARTY PAKISTAN 
through Athar Hussain, Advocate, General Secretary and 6 others v. 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and 2 others (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 
681), the Supreme Court of Pakistan, outlined the significance and scope of 
Article 218 of the “Constitution” in the following words: - 
“38. 
The Constitution provides a comprehensive mechanism to 
ensure minimal deviation from these dictates. It identifies and regulates one 
of the key aspects of democracy, the election process. In Article 218, the 
Constitution constitutes the Election Commission and empowers it to 
organize and oversee the election process and to ensure, inter alia, that it is 
conducted "honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law and that 
corrupt practices are guarded against". Article 218(3) of the Constitution 
enumerates the broad and overarching responsibility of the Election 
Commission and declares that:-- 
 
 
"218. Election Commission. 
 
(1) For the purpose of election to both Houses of Majlis-e-Shoora 
(Parliament), Provincial Assemblies and for election to such other 
public offices as may be specified by law, a permanent Election 
Commission shall be constituted in accordance with this Article. 
 
 
(2) The Election Commission shall consist of-- 
 
(a) The Commissioner who shall be the Chairman of the 
Commission; and 
 
(b) four members, each of whom has been a Judge of a High Court 
from each Province, appointed by the President in the manner 
provided for appointment of the Commissioner in clauses (2A) and 
(2B) of Article 213. 
 
(3) It shall be the duty of the Election Commission constituted in 
relation to an election to organize and conduct the election and to 
make such arrangements as are necessary to ensure that the election 
is conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law, and 
that corrupt practices are guarded against."

39. 
The phrase "the election is conducted honestly, justly, fairly 
and in accordance with law, and that corrupt practices are guarded 
against" as used in Article 218(3) of the Constitution informs the content 
and scope of powers conferred by it on the Election Commission. It may be 
advantageous to refer to the meanings of the terms "honestly", "justly" and 
"fairly" as given in various legal instruments, which read as under: - 
 
 
"Honestly": 
 
(i) 
'honest' means full of honour: just: fair dealing: upright: the 
opposite of thievish: free from fraud: candid: truthful: ingenious: 
seemly: respectable: chaste: honourable; 'honestly' means in an 
honest way: in truth; 'honesty' is the state of being honest: integrity: 
candour. [Chambers, 20th Century Dictionary, New Edition 1983 at 
page 601] 
 
(ii) 
'honesty'-"according  to  the  best  lexicographers  the  words 'truth' 
'veracity' and 'honesty' are almost synonymous, very nearly the 
same definitions being given to each of the words". [P. Ramanatha 
Aiyar's "Advanced Law Lexicon", 2005 Edition, Vol. 2, at page 
2153] 
 
(iii) 
Honesty is a thing deemed to be done in good faith, where it is 
infact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not. 
[Fakhruddin v. A. Shah (PLD 1982 Kar 790)] 
 
(vi) 
Honestly is state of mind which is psychological factor capable to 
prove or disprove only by a evidence or conduct. [Amjad Khan v. 
Marium (1993 CLC 175)] 
 
 
"Justly" 
 
(i) 
'just' means "conforming to or consonant with, what is legal or 
lawful, legally right, lawful"; ... "The words 'just' and 'justly' do not 
always mean 'just' and 'justly' in a moral sense, but they not 
unfrequently, in their connection with other words in a sentence, 
where a very different signification. It is evident, however, that the 
word 'just' in the statute [requiring an affidavit for an attachment to 
State that plaintiff's claim is just] means 'just ' in a moral sense; and 
from its isolation, being made a separate sub-division of the section, 
it is intended to mean 'morally just' in the most emphatic terms. The 
claim must be morally just as well as the legally just in order to 
entitle a party to an attachment." Robinson v. Burton (5 Kan. 300.) 
[Black's Law Dictionary, Revised 4th Edition of 1968, at page 
1001] 
 
(ii) 
"just' means righteous: fair: impartial: according to justice: due: in 
accordance with facts: well-grounded: accurately true: exact: 
normal: close-fitting: precisely: exactly: so much and no more: 
barely: only: merely: quite; "justly' means in a just manner: 
equitably: accurately: by right; "justness' means equity: fittingness: 
exactness. [Chambers, 20th Century Dictionary, New Edition 1983 
at page 686] 
 
(iii)  
'just'. As an adjective, fair; adequate; reasonable; probable; right in 

4 
 
 
W.P.No.195 of 2024 
 
 
 
accordance with law and justice right in law or ethics; rightful; 
legitimate, well founded; conformable to laws; conforming to the 
requirements of right or positive law; conformed to rules or 
principle of justice. 2 Bom LR 845. As an adverb of time the word 
"just' is equivalent to ""at this moment," of the least possible time 
since" (Ame. Cyc.). 
 
The word "just' is derived from the Latin "justus' which is from the 
Latin "jus' which means a right, and more technically a legal right--
- a law. The world "just' is defined by the Century Dictionary as 
conforming to the requirements of right or of positive law, and in 
Anderson's Law Dictionary as probable, reasonable. Kinney's Law 
Dictionary defines "just' as fair, adequate, reasonable, probable, and 
justa causa as a just case, a lawful ground. Being in conformity with 
justice [S.191, Expln.2, ill. (a) IPC (45 of 1860) and Art. 42, 
Const]; fair. 
 
An allegation is an indictment that an offence has "just' come to the 
knowledge of an officer having authority to prosecute is, by 
implication, a sufficient allegation that the offence had not 
previously come to the knowledge of any other public officer 
having authority to prosecute. 
 
"JUST' as sued in Laws providing that an affidavit for attachment 
shall show the nature of the plaintiffs claim, and that it is just, etc., 
should be construed to mean just in a moral sense. The claim must 
be morally just, as well as legally just in order to entitle a party to 
an attachment. "Shall have the power, if he shall think just, to order 
a new trial." in the County Courts Act, 1888 (51 & 52 Vict. c. 43), 
S.93. These words do not give a County court judge an absolute 
power of granting new trials. His power under the section is subject 
to the rules and limitations as to the granting of new trials which are 
binding upon the High Court, the Court of Appeal, and the House of 
Lords. Murtagh v. Barry (1890) 44 Ch D 632 (LORD 
COLERIDGE, C.J.). The crucial word in the phrase is ""just" which 
imparts a judicial, and not an absolute power. (Craies St. Law). 
 
The term "just' is derived from the Latin word "justus'. The word, 
"just' connotes reasonableness and something conforming to 
rectitude and justice something requirable and fair. M.A. Rahim and 
another v. Sayari Bai, AIR 1973 Mad 83,87. The world 'just' 
denotes equitability, fairness and reasonableness having a large 
peripheral field. Helen  C. Rebellor v. Maharashtra S.R.T.C., (1999) 
1 SCC 90, para 28: AIR 1998 SC 3191. The world 'just' occurring 
in Section 168 of the Act means that the compensation must be just 
and it cannot be a bonanza; not a source of profit but same should 
not be a pittance. The expression 'just' denotes equitability, fairness 
and reasonableness and non-arbitrariness. Divisional Controller 
KSRTC v. Mahadeva  Shetty, (2003) 7 SCC 197, para 15. [Motor 
Vehicles Act (59 of 1988), S. 168]. 
 
Reasonableness may be 'good cause' but it is not necessarily 'just 
cause'. If a person voluntarily retires on pension, he is getting a 
substantial financial benefit for himself, and it is not fair or just to 
the unemployment fund that he should also get unemployment 

5

benefit for the six weeks under the act. Crewe v. Social Security 
Commissioner, (1982) 2 All ER 745, 749. [Social Security Act, 
1975, S.20(1)(a)]. 
 
The words 'just cause' in S.263 are exhaustive and not merely 
illustrative. Merely the failure to fill an inventory or the account 
within the specified time is not sufficient. It must be established that 
the person to whom the grant has been made wilfully and without 
reasonable cause omitted to exhibit them. In Re. T. Arumuga 
Mudaliar, AIR 1955 Mad 622. [Indian Succession Act (39 of 1925), 
S.263]. [P. Ramanatha Aiyar's "Advanced Law Lexicon", 2005 
Edition, Vol. 3, at pages 2539 and 2540:] 
 
(iv) 
'just' means according to law. [Utility Stores Corporation  of 
Pakistan Ltd v. Punjab Labour Appellate Tribunal (PLD 1987 SC 
447) and Shahi Bottlers (Pvt) Ltd v. Punjab Appellate Tribunal 
(1993 SCMR 1370)] 
 
 
"Fairly" 
 
(i) 
'fairly' means "equitably, honestly, impartially.... Justly, rightly, 
with 
substantial 
correctness, 
reasonably...". 
[Black's 
Law 
Dictionary, Revised 4th Edition of 1968, at page 719] 
 
(ii) 
'fairly' means beautifully: neatly: justly: reasonably: plainly: gently: 
fully: quite: tolerably. [Chambers, 20th Century Dictionary, New 
Edition 1983 at page 452] 
 
(iii) 
'fair' --"the world conveys some idea of justice or equity in partial 
free from suspicion or bias; equitable; reasonable; honest; upright; 
and as applied to the weather, a fair weather is one free from 
clouds; 
not 
obscure"-'FAIR, 
HONEST, 
EQUITABLE, 
REASONABLE' - 'fairness" enters into every minute circumstance 
connected with the interest of the parties, and weights them alike 
for both; honestly is contended with a literal conformity to the law, 
it consults the interest of one party. An estimate is fair in which 
profit and loss, merit and demerit with every collateral circumstance 
is duly weighed; a judgment is equitable which decides suitably and 
advantageously for both parties; a price is reasonable which does 
not exceed the limits of reason or propriety. A decision may be 
either fair or equitable; but the former is said mostly in regard to 
trifling matters, and the latter in regard to the important rights of 
mankind. It is the business of the umpire to decide fairly between  
the  combatants, it  is  the  business  of  the  Judge  to decide  
equitably  between  men  whose  property  is  at  issue." [P. 
Ramanatha Aiyar's "Advanced Law Lexicon", 2005 Edition, Vol. 2, 
at page 1761 and 1762] 
 
A perusal of the above shows that the words "justly", "fairly" and 
"honestly" have similar shades of meaning. As has been rightly submitted 
by Mr. Farogh Naseem, these words imply that the Election Commission is 
under a direct constitutional obligation to exercise all powers invested in it 
in a bona fide manner, meeting the highest of standards and norms. As a 
natural corollary, therefore, all discretionary power is also to be exercised 
and tested against these standards. 

6 
 
 
W.P.No.195 of 2024 
 
 
 
 
40. 
A bare reading of Article 218(3) makes it clear that the 
Election Commission is charged with the duty to 'organize' and 'conduct the 
election'. The language of the Article implies that the Election Commission 
is responsible not only for conducting the election itself, but also for 
making all necessary arrangements for the said purpose, prior to the 
Election Day. By conferring such responsibility on the Election 
Commission, the Constitution ensures that all activities both prior, on and 
subsequent to Election Day, that are carried out in anticipation thereof, 
adhere to standards of justness and fairness, are honest, in accordance with 
law and free from corrupt practices. This Court in Election Commission of 
Pakistan v. Javaid Hashmi and others (PLD 1989 SC 396), observed that 
"(g)enerally speaking election is a process which starts with the issuance of 
the election programme and consists of the various links and stages in that 
behalf, as for example, filing of nomination papers, their scrutiny, the 
hearing of objections and the holding of actual polls. If any of these links is 
challenged it really (is) tantamount to challenging the said process of 
election". It interpreted that the phrase 'conduct the election' as having 
"wide import" and including all stages involved in the election process. 
These observations subject all election related activities that take place 
between the commencement and the end of the election process to the 
jurisdiction conferred on the Election Commission under Article 218(3). 
The Election Commission therefore has to test all election related activities 
that are carried out in the relevant period, both individually and 
collectively, against the standards enumerated therein. 
41. 
The Election Commission may also exercise its powers in 
anticipation of an ill that may have the effect of rendering the election 
unfair. In the case titled as In Re: Petition filed by Syed Qaim Ali Shah 
Jellani (PLD 1991 Jour. 41) the Elections Commission exercised its powers 
under Article 218(3) pre-emptively, by making all necessary arrangements 
to ensure that a certain class of people would be allowed to vote. This case 
implies that where a violation of the standards mentioned in Article 218(3) 
has not as yet taken place, the Election Commission is legally empowered 
under Article 218(3) to exercise its powers pre-emptively in order to avoid 
a violation of these standards. Furthermore, Mst. Qamar Sultana v. Public 
at Large (1989 MLD 360) and In Re: Complaint of Malpractices in 
Constituency No. NA-57, Sargodha-V (supra) both reinforce the argument 
that the Election Commission is fully empowered by Article 218(3) to 
make 'such orders as may in its opinion be necessary for ensuring that the 
election is fair, honest etc'. These decisions recognize that the Election 
Commission enjoys broad powers not only to take pre-emptive action but 
also to pass any and all orders necessary to ensure that the standards of 
'honesty, justness and fairness' mentioned in Article 218(3) are met.” 
5.  
Moving further, it is noticed that Article 219 of the “Constitution” 
prescribes the duties of Election Commission, which reads as under: - 
219. Duties of Commission. The Commission shall be 
charged with the duty of – 
(a) 
preparing electoral rolls for election to the National 
Assembly, 
Provincial 
Assemblies 
and 
local 
governments, and revising such rolls periodically to 
keep them up-to-date; 

7 
 
 
W.P.No.195 of 2024 
 
 
 
(b) 
organizing and conducting election to the Senate or 
to fill casual vacancies in a House or a Provincial 
Assembly; 
(c) 
appoint Election Tribunals; 
(d) 
The holding of general elections to the National 
Assembly, Provincial Assemblies and the local 
Governments; and 
(e) 
Such other functions as may be specified by an Act of 
Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament); 
Provided that till such time as the members of the 
Commission are first appointed in accordance with the provisions 
of paragraph (b) of clause (2) of Article 218 pursuant to the 
constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010, and enter upon 
their office, the Commissioner shall remain charged with the duties 
enumerated in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Article.” 
In addition, Chapter-2 Part-VIII deals with Electoral Laws and Conduct of 
Elections. Prime duty of the Election Commission is thus to ensure free, fair 
and transparent elections.  
6.  
In order to amend, consolidate and unify laws relating to the 
conduct of elections and matters connected therewith or ancillary thereto, the 
Elections Act (XXXIII of 2017) (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 2017”) was 
enacted. Chapter V of the “Act, 2017” lays down the procedure for the 
conduct of elections to the Assemblies. Section 59 is directly related to the 
matter in issue as it deals with the establishment of Polling Stations for the 
purpose of election. For ready reference and convenience, same is 
reproduced below: - 
 
59. 
Polling 
stations.—(1) 
Within 
one 
week 
after 
appointment of Returning Officers, the Commission shall provide, 
in the prescribed format, a list of proposed polling stations for each 
constituency to the Returning Officer of that constituency indicating 
the electoral areas assigned to each polling station and publish the 
list on its website.  
  
(2) The Commission shall, as far as practicable, retain the 
polling stations established for the preceding election but it may 
add to or alter the list as may be required to reduce the distance 
preferably to one kilometer between a polling station and the voters 
assigned to it.  
  
(3) As far as practicable, not more than twelve hundred 
voters shall be assigned to a polling station and not more than three 

8 
 
 
W.P.No.195 of 2024 
 
 
 
hundred voters shall be assigned to a polling booth, and reasons for 
any deviation shall be recorded in writing.  
  
(4) Within fifteen days of the receipt of the list of polling 
stations, the Returning Office--  
(a) shall personally verify the proposed polling stations;  
(b) may add to or alter the list as he may deem necessary; 
and  
(c) shall publish outside his office the preliminary list of 
polling stations, inviting objections and suggestions, if 
any, to be filed within twenty-one days of its publication.  
 
(5) Objections and suggestions may be filed with the District 
Returning Officer-- 
(a) by a candidate, with regard to any polling station in his 
constituency; and  
(b) by a voter, with regard only to the polling station to 
which he has been assigned.  
 
(6) The District Returning Officer may, after hearing the 
objections or considering the suggestions, if any filed with him and 
making such summary enquiry as he may deem necessary, make 
alterations in the list of polling stations as may be required and 
shall, at least thirty days before the polling day, publish in the 
official Gazette and on the website of the Commission the final list 
of polling stations of each constituency in the district.  
 
(7) The Commission shall determine the date or dates 
required for completion of the actions mentioned in this section.  
 
(8) The District Returning Officer shall not make any 
change in the final list of polling stations published in the official 
Gazette, save in very exceptional circumstances, for reasons to be 
recorded, with the prior approval of the Commission not later than 
five days before polling and a copy of such change shall be 
transmitted to the candidates immediately without loss of any time 
and after notice to the candidates.  
  
(9) The Returning Officer shall establish in each 
constituency polling stations according to the final list published 
under sub-section (6).  
  
(10) A polling station shall be situated in any Government 
building in the constituency and, where no Government building is 
available, a polling station may be established in a building owned 
by a private educational institution registered with the concerned 
education authorities or an improvised polling station shall be set 
up on a public property.  
  
(11) A polling station shall not be located in any premises 
which belongs to or is under the direct or indirect control of a 
candidate or a political party.  

9 
 
 
W.P.No.195 of 2024 
 
 
 
 
(12) While finalizing the list of polling stations of a 
constituency, if the District Returning Officer declares a polling 
station as highly sensitive, the Commission may, in addition to 
appropriate security measures as may be taken, install or direct any 
Government to install a surveillance camera in each polling booth 
of such polling station to record poll proceedings, counting of vote 
process and preparation of results by the Presiding Officer. 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
It clearly manifests from the bare reading of the above referred provision that 
while notifying polling station, the Election Commission, in ordinary 
circumstances, shall retain the polling stations established for the preceding 
election. Sub-section (5), however, postulates that a candidate can file 
objections and suggestions with regard to any polling station in his 
constituency and a voter with respect to a polling station to which he has 
been assigned.  In terms thereof, respondents No.3 and 4, being voters filed 
application for change of polling station from Govt. Primary School Allah 
Dad Khelan Wala to newly established Veterinary Dispensary on Dabb Road, 
Mianwali on the following grounds- 
  "۔۔۔اہجں رپ ہی وپگنل نشیٹس واعق ےہ وہ ب لکل دور دراز اکی وکہن ےہ اور واہں آس اپس ےک ولگ افصنمہن ووگنٹ ںیم ہشیمہ راکوٹ ڈالت ی ہ ت ں

7.  
It would not be out of place to mention here that a cross 
application was also moved by the petitioner, being voter of the constituency 
resisting the change of polling station. On receipt of objections/suggestions 
from rival applicants, respondents No.2 requisitioned a report from the 
Returning Officer of the constituency. It evinces from the record that instead 
of submitting his report, the Returning Officer sent his recommendation that 
as there are rival objectors, so matter may be disposed off as per the decision 
of District Returning Officer i.e. respondent No.2. It would also not be out of 

10 
 
 
W.P.No.195 of 2024 
 
 
 
context to mention here that on receipt of application, a report was also 
submitted by Assistant Education Officer, Mianwali recommending the 
retaining of polling station, at Govt. Primary School, Allah Dad Khelan 
Wala. The respondent No.2, however, proceeded to accede the application of 
respondents No.3 and 4 through impugned order. The relevant extract from 
the same is reproduced below: - 
“2. 
The undersigned visited the locations of both Polling 
Stations. Later on, the applicants  others were called for hearing on 
15-01-2024 and heard in the presence of concerned RO. The 
applicants appeared before the undersigned and explained their 
issues for which they want to change the Polling Station building. 
The present polling station Govt. Primary School Allah Dad Khelan 
wala is located in the area where people have tribal conflicts and 
due to such reasons that vote cast ration is very low. However, the 
building for which applicants  have filed application is located in a 
neutral area and easy to reachable for all the residents. They have 
also submitted copy of FIRs as a proof of enmity/conflicts. As both 
applications are same matter therefore, these will be disposed of 
with single order. The arguments from both side applicants have 
been heard in length. 
3. 
In pursuance of directions of Election Commission of 
Pakistan 
issued 
vide 
No.F.2(1)/2023-Cord-Vol-IX, 
dated 
16.12.2023 in para 2(5), the District Returning Officer can decide 
such objections after inquiry and due to notice to the objectors, 
therefore, keeping in view the vote casting ratio, arguments 
advanced by the parties and the fact that some FIRs of “Murder” 
and “attempt of murder” were registered against some persons 
living near GPS Allah Dad Khelan Wala, I am of the considered 
view that all voters cannot cast their vote without fear of life at the 
present polling station. Therefore, in order to avoid any untoward 
incident on polling day, the application of Hakim Khan etc is 
hereby accepted and the building of the Polling Station Govt. 
Primary School Allah Dad Khela Wala is hereby swapped to the 
newly established building of Veterinary Dispensary on Dabb road 
for the conduct of free and peaceful elections.” 
(Underling supplied for emphasis) 
It is, thus, apparent from the tenor of the impugned order that the respondent 
No.2 was mainly influenced with the vote casting ratio and registration of 
F.I.R’s of murder and attempt of murder against some persons living near 
Govt. Primary School Allah Dad, Khelan Wala. 
8.  
In order to defend the impugned order, a report is also submitted 
by respondent No.2 in response to this constitutional petition. In para-4 of 
parawise comments, three F.I.R’s are mentioned, which relate to the years 

11 
 
 
W.P.No.195 of 2024 
 
 
 
2006, 2018 and 2020 respectively. Needless to observe that if criteria for the 
establishment or change of polling station is made dependent upon the 
number of F.I.R’s registered in the police station of that area, no polling 
station can be allowed to subsist. If such a trend is allowed to prevail, then 
there will be no constituency where a polling station can be established. 
Registration of only three cases in fourteen years starting from 2006 to 2020 
would speak loudly that this part of the world is more peaceful as compared 
to any other territory. 
9.  
So far second limb of reasons which prevailed upon the respondent 
No.2 for swapping the notified polling station that there is less vote casting 
ratio; suffice to observe that respondent No.2 while forming this view was 
surely oblivious of turn over of the voters in the preceding election where vote 
casting ratio at the Govt. Boys Primary School, Allah Dad Khelan Wala was 
more than 50%. 
10.  
There is no cavil to the proposition that conducting of elections 
and establishment of polling stations is primarily a subject falling within the 
domain of Election Commission. Needless to mention that establishment of a 
polling station at a suitable place is one of the steps to ensure fair and 
transparent voting process. Where once it evinces from the record that there 
is some grave violation of law in the said process, this Court is vested with 
the jurisdiction to redress and cure such patent illegalities in exercise of its 
powers under judicial review.  
11.  
From the naked eyes, it can be observed that respondent No.2 
while swapping the polling station Govt. Boys Primary School, Allah Dad 
Khelan Wala proceeded in a mechanical manner and showing scorn to 
section 59 of the “Act, 2017”accepted the application of respondents No.3 
and 4 through impugned order, which is clearly tainted with illegalities. 
12.  
For the foregoing reasons, this petition is allowed, as a result 
order dated 15th January, 2024 passed by respondent No.2 is set aside being 
illegal and unlawful. As a sequel, respondent No.2 is directed to restore the

W.P.No.195 of 2024 
 
 
 
polling station at Govt. Boys Primary School, Allah Dad Khelan wala. No 
order as to costs. 
13.  
The above are the detailed reasons for short order dated 
26.01.2024, which reads as under: - 
“For the reasons to be recorded later, this petition is allowed as 
prayed for.”.
