3. 
Precisely, the necessary facts of the prosecution case, as stated by Muhammad 
Sarwar (PW-1), the complainant of the case, are as under:- 
 
“Stated that I am resident of Chak No. 165/7-R Tehsil Fortabbas and 
cultivator by profession. My son Muhammad Imran army personnel had 
come to house on leaves whose leaves had to end on 16-02-2021 and he had 
to go back on duty. On 16-02-2021 at about 9:30 am. I alongwith 
Muhammad Imran, Usman Haider my sons, my brother Daryafat Ali, my 
nephew Gulzar Ahmad went to see my daughter who used to reside at Chak 
No. 105/6-R Tehsil Haroonabad. My both sons Muhammad Imran and 
Usman Haider were on one motor cycle and 1 alongwit (sic) my brother 
Daryafat Ali and Gulzar Anwar were on another motor cycle. My both sons 
Muhammad Imran and Usman Haider were going two acre ahead from us, 
when they Muhammad Imran and Usman Haider reached at a distance of 
3/4 acre from chak No.140/6-R on "Kacha Path" suddenly Muhammad 
Ishaq, Muhammad Ilyas, Muhammad Abbas and Muhammad Mansha sons 
of Muhammad Nawaz armed with deadly fire arm weapons, Usama S/O 
Mohsin armed with fire armed weapon, Zain-Ali S/O Muhammad Mansha 
armed with fire armed weapon, Salaho-u-Din S/O Faqir Hussain armed with 
fire arm weapon, all Jutt by caste and R/O Chak No.165/7-R came in front 
of my sons. Muhammad Mansha accused raised Lalkara to teach a lesson to 
my sons Usman Haider etc for the murder of Aqib Haroon son of 
Muhammad Mansha and the accused persons tried to stop my both sons 
forcibly. My both sons Muhammad Imran and Usman Haider due to fear 
and to save their lives run towards the north-west side in the crop by leaving 
the motor cycle. At the same time accused Usama S/O Mohsin made two 
fires with his fire arm weapon on my son Muhammad Imran and Usman 
Haider which were not hit them. All the above said accused persons chased 
my both sons by brandishing their fire arm weapons. In the meanwhile, I, 
my brother Daryafat Ali and Ghulzar Anwar PW also followed the accused 
persons to save lives of my sons. On our hue and cry one Majid Mahmood 
S/O Mahmood Ali caste Jutt R/O Adda Rafiq Abad who was going to take 
the fodder for the cattle from Chak No. 140/6-R, also came there and joined 
us. At a distance of 8-acre accused persons Usama S/O Mohsin and Ishaq 
S/O Nawaz circled my son Muhammad Imran whereas accused Muhammad 
Ilyas, Muhammad Abbas, Zain Ali, Muhammad Mansha and Salah-u-Din 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022

stopped my son Usman Haider at a distance of 1 ½ acre ahead from my son 
Imran. In our scene accused Usama S/O Mohsin made a fire with his fire 
arm weapon which hit on the left side of nose of Muhammad Imran (my 
son). Muhammad Ishaq accused made a fire which hit above the umbilical 
region of my son Imran. Ishaq accused made a second fire which hit on the 
umbilical region of my son Muhammad Imran. Accused Muhammad Ilyas 
made a fire with his fire arm weapon which hit on the upper side of left eye 
of my son Usman Haider. Accused Muhammad Abbas made a fire shot with 
his fire arm weapon which hit on the left side of neck of Usman Haider my 
son. Accused Muhammad Abbas accused again made a fire shot with his 
fire arm weapon which hit on the front of neck of my son Usman Haider. 
Accused Muhammad Mansha made a fire shot with his fire arm weapon 
which hit on the left shoulder of my son Usman Haider. Accused Zain Ali 
made a fire shot with his fire arm weapon which hit on the left palm of my 
son Usman Haider. Accused Salaho-u-Din S/O Faqir Hussain made a fire 
shot with his fire arm weapon which hit on the left wrist of my son Usman 
Haider. My both sons fell down on the ground. We tried to apprehend the 
accused persons but they by brandishing their weapons threatened us that if 
we came near to them they will done to death us and they succeeded to flee 
away. I alongwith PWS attended my sons Muhammad Imran and Usman 
Haider who succumbed to their injuries at the spot. The above said 
occurrence was committed on the abetment of Muhammad Waris, 
Muhammad Nawaz sons of Muhammad Sharif and Maqsood Ahmad S/O 
Asghar Ali all Jutt by caste and R/O Chak No. 165/7-R. 
 
 
The motive behind this occurrence is that one Aqib Haroon son of 
Muhammad Mansha (accused) caste Jutt was murdered by some unknown 
person in the year 2019. Muhammad Mansha accused got registered the 
case against my son Usman Haider etc at P.S. Khichi Wala. My son Usman 
Haider etc was acquitted by the learned court of ASJ, Fortabbas in the said 
case. Accused persons had nourished grudge of the acquittal of my son 
Usman Haider etc, due to this grudge, all the accused persons murdered my 
both sons with their common object. I submitted a written application Exh-
PA to the police P.S. Faqir Wali on the same day on 16-02-2021 upon which 
case FIR No.89/2021 u/s 302/148/149/109 PPC P.S. Faqir Wali Exh-PB 
was registered. After post mortem examination of both the dead bodies I 
received the dead bodies of my both sons in lieu of receipts Exh-PC and 
Exh-PD. During the investigation I produced the solid evidence alongwith 
eye witnesses to the I.O. but the 1.0 of the case declared the accused persons 
Muhammad Ilyas, Zain Ali, Salaho-u-Din, Muhammad Waris, Muhammad 
Nawaz sons of Muhammad Sharif and Maqsood Ahmad as innocent being 
in league with the accused persons. 1.0. also wrote a fake supplementary 
statement by showing the date 17-02-2021 on my behalf and on behalf of 
the PWs in which I.O. mentioned that Muhammad Latif alias Changa S/O 
Muhammad Ali resident of Chak No.138/6-R Tehsil Haroonabad and 
accused Muhammad Mansha fired at my son Muhammad Imran (deceased) 
alongwith co-accused. I and PWs did not got recorded any supplementary 
statement before the 1.0. I.O. wrote our supplementary statement only to 
give the benefit to the accused persons in league with them. That is why I 
filed this private complaint Exh-PE bearing my signature. I submit attested

On 12.01.2022, the learned counsel for the complainant gave up the witnesses 
namely Gulzar Anwar and Majid Mahmood as being unnecessary. On 08.02.2022, 
the learned counsel for the complainant gave up the witnesses namely Mudassir 
Rehman 1414/C, Muhammad Waqas CSIU and Mubashir Hussain as being 
unnecessary. On 24.02.2022, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor closed 
the prosecution evidence after submitting the report of the Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore (Exh.PG) regarding the analysis of blood stained earth and the 
report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PH) regarding the 
comparison of empty shells of bullets and cartridges with the weapons recovered 
from the accused. 
 
9. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined the 
appellants namely Muhammad Ishaq son of Muhammad Nawaz, Muhammad Ilyas 
son of Muhammad Nawaz , Muhammad Abbas son of Muhammad Nawaz, Mansha 
son of Muhammad Nawaz and Usama son of Mohsin under section 342 Cr.P.C. and 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
11 
 
in answer to the question why this case against you and why the P.W.s have deposed 
against you, the appellants replied that they had been involved in the case falsely and 
were innocent. The appellants, namely Muhammad Ishaq son of Muhammad Nawaz, 
Muhammad Ilyas son of Muhammad Nawaz , Muhammad Abbas son of Muhammad 
Nawaz, Mansha son of Muhammad Nawaz  and Usama son of Mohsin, opted not to 
get themselves examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, and did not adduce any 
evidence in their defence.  
 
10. 
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Haroonabad convicted and sentenced the appellants as referred to above.   
11. 
The contention of the learned counsel for the appellants precisely is that the 
whole case is fabricated and false and that the prosecution remained unable to prove 
the facts in issue and did not produce any unimpeachable, admissible and relevant 
evidence. The learned counsel for the appellants in support of this appeal, further 
contended that the story of the prosecution mentioned in the F.I.R., on the face of it, 
was highly improbable and the reason assigned by the complainant and the eye-
witnesses for being present at the place of occurrence was without any justification. 
He further contended that the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) were not worthy of 
any reliance. The learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that the 
recovery of  the motorcycle (P-18) from the appellant namely Muhammad Abbas 
and the recovery of the Repeater gun (P-19) from the appellant namely Muhammad 
Abbas, the recovery of the rifle (P-21) from the appellant namely Mansha, the 
recovery of the gun (P-23) from the appellant Muhammad Ishaq and the recovery of 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
12 
 
the gun (P-25) from the appellant Usama were full of procedural defects, of no legal 
worth and value and result of fake proceedings. He finally submitted that the 
prosecution has totally failed to prove the case against the accused beyond the 
shadow of doubt.   
 
12. 
On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the 
learned counsel for the complainant, contended that the prosecution has proved its 
case beyond the shadow of doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the complainant 
further argued that the deceased died as a result of injuries suffered at the hands of 
the appellants namely Muhammad Ishaq son of Muhammad Nawaz, Muhammad 
Ilyas son of Muhammad Nawaz , Muhammad Abbas son of Muhammad Nawaz, 
Mansha son of Muhammad Nawaz  and Usama son of Mohsin. The learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the complainant further 
contended that the medical evidence also corroborated the statements of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat 
(PW-2) . The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for 
the complainant, further argued that the recovery of  the motorcycle (P-18) from the 
appellant namely Muhammad Abbas and the recovery of the Repeater gun (P-19) 
from the appellant namely Muhammad Abbas, the recovery of the rifle (P-21) from 
the appellant namely Mansha, the recovery of the gun (P-23) from the appellant 
Muhammad Ishaq and the recovery of the gun (P-25) from the appellant Usama and 
the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.H.) also 
corroborated the ocular account. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
13 
 
the learned counsel for the complainant further contended that there was no occasion 
for the prosecution witnesses, who were related to the deceased, to substitute the real 
offenders with the innocent in this case. Lastly, the learned Deputy Prosecutor 
General along with the learned counsel for the complainant, prayed for the rejection 
of the appeal. 
13. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellants, the learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the complainant and, with 
their assistance, perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial.  
14. 
  A perusal of the prosecution evidence reveals that  it is an admitted aspect of 
the prosecution case that the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  were indeed not the residents of the place 
of occurrence or any place near the same. According to the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2),  the 
occurrence took place in Chak No.140/6-R, whereas both the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  were 
residents of  Chak No.165/7-R , which place was at a distance from the place of 
occurrence . the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1), during 
cross-examination stated as under:- 
“ The distance between my house and the place of occurrence is about 
2 ½ to 3 squares. It is incorrect to suggest that my residence falls at a 
distance of about 2-km from place of occurrence. It is correct that my house 
falls in the area of police station Khichi Wala Tehsil Fort Abbas and the 
place of occurrence falls in the area of police station Faqirwali Tehsil 
Haroonabad towards south.

village.” (emphasis supplied)

The above-referred portions of the cross-examination of the prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) reflect that the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  can be validly termed 
as “chance witnesses” and therefore were under a bounden duty to provide a 
convincing reason for their presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of 
occurrence and were also under a duty to prove their presence by producing some 
physical proof of the same. We have noted with grave concern that the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  
failed miserably to provide any consistent evidence as to the reason for their arrival 
at the place of occurrence and their presence at the place of occurrence when the 
same was taking place.  According to the statement of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) , the reason 
for them going to the place of occurrence was that the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) along with the 
deceased were going towards Chak No. 105/6-R to visit the daughter of the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and on their way, while 
passing through Chak 140/6-R, the occurrence took place. A dispassionate analysis 
of the prosecution evidence reveals that both the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) failed to prove the 
stated reason for them to have gone to the place of occurrence. Ghulam Shabbir, 
Inspector (CW-7) , the Investigating Officer of the case , during the course of 
investigation , even did not visit Chak No. 105/6-R so as to verify as to whether the 
stated reason of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) to visit the said Chak No. 105/6-R was correct or 
otherwise. Moreover, during the course of trial, the complainant of the case namely 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
15 
 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) , made no effort to prove that he had a daughter living 
in Chak No. 105/6-R with whom he was proceeding to meet when the occurrence 
took place. Similarly, the complainant of the case namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-
1) did not even show the house of his daughter which was allegedly situated in Chak 
No. 105/6-R  to Ghulam Shabbir, Inspector (CW-7) , the Investigating Officer of the 
case . So much so that the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-
1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) even did not name the said daughter of the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) who they were going to 
meet in Chak No. 105/6-R. More worrying are the admissions of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) that 
despite the fact that Chak No. 105/6-R was situated towards the western side of 
Chak No. 165/7-R, the Chak where the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) had started their journey from , 
and the Chak No. 140/6-R , the Chak where the occurrence took place, was situated 
on the northern side of Chak No. 165/7-R, how and why the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) and the 
deceased were found to be present in Chak No. 140/6-R at the time when the 
occurrence took place,  as obviously Chak No. 140/6-R was on the northern side of 
Chak No. 165/7-R, whereas Chak No. 105/6-R was on the western side of Chak No. 
165/7-R.  The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) , during 
cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“ Chak No. 105/6-R is situated towards west from my village” 
Abdul Shakoor, Patwari (CW-2) explained during cross-examination, as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
16 
 
“ Chak No.165/7-R situated towards southern side from the place of occurrence 
mentioned in both scale site plan.” 
A perusal of the statements of the  prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar 
(PW-1) and Abdul Shakoor, Patwari (CW-2) reveals the positioning of Chak No. 
165/7-R, Chak No. 140/6-R  and Chak No. 105/6-R as under:- 
                                    
 
Despite realizing this flaw in their statements that while proceeding from the place 
of residence of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2), being Chak No. 165/7-R to Chak No. 105/6-R, the 
Chak No. 140/6-R did not even fall on the same route, still the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) 
could not explain their arrival at Chak No. 140/6-R while departing from Chak No. 
165/7-R towards Chak No. 105/6-R. The prosecution witness namely Muhammad 
Sarwar (PW-1), admitted during cross-examination, as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
17 
 
“ It is correct that a way towards west from our village leads to Chak No.105/6-
R is available for the direct approach of Chak No.105/6-R without entering into 
Chak No. 140/6-R.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) , stated as under:- 
“It is correct that a metal road leads towards Chak NO.105/6-R from our 
village via Faqirwali. It is correct that the way mentioned in my examination-
in-chief through Chak No.140/6-R is a non-metallic thoroughfare leading to 
Chak No. 105/6-R. Chak No.105/6-R might be at a distance of 5 to 10 km away 
from my village. ” (emphasis supplied)  
 In this manner, it is conclusively proved that  the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  made a false claim 
that on the day of occurrence, they had proceeded from their residence situated in 
Chak No. 165/7-R towards Chak No. 105/6-R when they arrived at Chak No. 140/6-
R and witnessed the occurrence. 
16. 
Additionally, it was claimed by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  that they had gone to the place of 
occurrence on one motorcycle, however, during the course of the investigation as 
well as before the learned trial court, the said motorcycle allegedly used by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat 
(PW-2)   to arrive at the place of occurrence , was not produced. The prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1), during cross-examination, stated as 
under:- 
“My both sons Muhammad Imran and Usman Haider were on one motor 
cycle and I alongwith my brother Daryafat Ali and Gulzar Anwar were 
on another motor cycle. ” (emphasis supplied)

Ghulam Shabbir, Inspector (CW-7) , the Investigating Officer of the case, visited the 
place of occurrence, after the occurrence and remained there for a considerable time. 
During the course of his stay at the place of occurrence, Ghulam Shabbir, Inspector 
(CW-7) , the Investigating Officer of the case did not take into possession the 
motorcycle allegedly used by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  to arrive at the place of occurrence 
alongwith the other recoveries, though there was no occasion for the said motorcycle 
not to have been present at the place of occurrence or not being taken into possession 
by the Investigating Officer during his visit at the place of the occurrence, if the same 
was available.  The said motorcycle which was used by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) was not even 
produced during the entire period of investigation nor was produced before the 
learned trial court. The non-production of the motorcycle used by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)   to 
arrive at the place of occurrence and the failure of  prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  as well as the 
Investigating Officer of the case to produce the same before the learned trial court, 
though the case was instituted upon a private complaint filed by Muhammad Sarwar 
(PW-1) and  the said motorcycle could have always been produced before the learned 
trial court but was not, leads to only one conclusion and that being that no such 
motorcycle was available. Had a motorcycle been  used by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  to arrive at 
the place of occurrence, then the same must have been available at the place of 
occurrence, at the time of arrival of Ghulam Shabbir, Inspector (CW-7), the 
Investigating Officer of the case and the same would necessarily would have been 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
19 
 
taken into possession by Ghulam Shabbir, Inspector (CW-7) , the Investigating 
Officer of the case but it was not and it proves that a false claim was made by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat 
(PW-2)  that they had arrived at the place of occurrence on a motorcycle. The very 
inception of the prosecution case is, therefore, put in doubt. Reliance in this regard 
is placed on the case of “Muhammad Ali Vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 137) wherein 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:- 
“The Investigating Officer during the cross-examination has admitted that 
the 'Dala' was not present when he visited the spot and he had not taken 
into possession the said 'Dala' during investigation. So the story introduced 
by the eye-witnesses that they were travelling on the 'Dala' when the 
incident took place is not supported by any connecting material.” 
In this manner, the eye witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  not only failed miserably to establish the reason for 
their arrival and presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence but 
also the mode through which they came to arrive at the place of occurrence. The 
prosecution was under a bounden duty to establish that the occurrence had indeed 
taken place when the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  had proceeded to and arrived at the place of the 
occurrence and the failure to prove any reason for the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  to have proceeded to 
the place of occurrence and the failure to prove the mode through which they came 
to arrive at the place of occurrence, has vitiated our trust in prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) . In this 
respect, reliance is placed on the case of “Muhammad Rafiq v. State” (2014 SCMR 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
20 
 
1698) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan rejected the claim of witnesses 
who lived one kilometre away from the occurrence, but on the day of occurrence 
stated to be present near the spot as they working as labourers, inasmuch as they 
failed to give any detail of the projects they were working on. Reliance is also placed 
on the case of “Usman alias Kaloo v. State” (2017 SCMR 622) wherein the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the ocular account of the incident had been 
furnished by Zahoor Ahmad complainant Ghulam Farid and Manzoor Ahmed 
witnesses in the said case, who were all residents of some other houses and were not 
the inmates of the house wherein the occurrence had taken place and therefore the 
said eye-witnesses being, chance witnesses, were declared not worthy of reliance. 
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Nasrullah alias Nasro v. The State” (2017 
SCMR 724) ) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:- 
“In the case in hand the eye-witnesses produced by the 
prosecution lived eighty kilometers away from the scene of the 
crime, their stated reason for presence in the house of occurrence 
at the time of incident in issue had never been established through 
any independent evidence.” 
 
17.     We have noted with serious anxiety that the ocular account of the occurrence 
as furnished by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)   is inconsistent with the medical evidence as furnished 
by Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-3)  and flawed beyond mending , resulting in disfiguring 
the complexion of the whole prosecution case beyond reparation and recognition. 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) , in his statement before the learned trial court, stated as 
under:- 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
21 
 
“Muhammad Ishaq accused made a fire which hit above the umbilical region of 
my son Imran. Ishaq accused made a second fire which hit on the umbilical 
region of my son Muhammad Imran.  
…………… 
 Accused Zain Ali made a fire shot with his fire arm weapon which hit on the left 
palm of my son Usman Haider. Accused Salaho-u-Din S/O Faqir Hussain made 
a fire shot with his fire arm weapon which hit on left wrist of my son Usman 
Haider” .emphasis supplied)  
Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  in his statement before the learned trial court stated 
as under:- 
“Muhammad Ishaq accused made a fire which hit above the umbilical region of 
Imran. Ishaq accused made a second fire which hit on the umbilical  region of 
Muhammad Imran.  
…………. 
Accused Zain Ali made a fire shot with his fire arm weapon which hit on the left 
palm of Usman Haider. Accused Salaho-u-Din S/O Faqir Hussain made a fire shot 
with his fire arm weapon which hit on the left wrist of Usman Haider.” (emphasis 
supplied)  
A perusal of the above referred statements of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  reveals that 
according to them the appellant namely Muhammad Ishaq fired with a firearm 
weapon, hitting Muhammad Imran (deceased), twice on his umbilical area, 
whereas Zain Ali (since acquitted),fired with his firearm weapon,  hitting the left 
hand of Usman Haider (deceased) and Salah-ud-Din (since acquitted) fired with 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
22 
 
his firearm weapon,  hitting on the left wrist of Usman Haider (deceased). Contrary 
to the above-referred statements of the eyewitnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) , Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-3),  who 
conducted the post mortem examinations of the dead bodies of the deceased namely  
Usman Haider and Muhammad Imran, did not observe presence of any injury caused 
by use of a firearm weapon on the left hand of Usman Haider (deceased) and on 
the left wrist of Usman Haider (deceased) and also noted that  Muhammad Imran 
(deceased) had suffered from only one injury  on his umbilical area and not two, as 
was stated by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2). Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-3) further explained during 
cross-examination as under:- 
“ It is correct that injury No.6 mentioned above on the dead body of Usman Haider 
was not a fire arm injury since it was mere laceration on the palmer surface of 
left hand. It is correct that injury No.7 on the dead body of Usman Haider was 
also not a fire arm injury. It is correct that injuries No.6 & 7 on the dead body of 
Usman Haider can be caused with some collusion or striking with some blunt 
subject. 
…………… 
It is correct that vide injury No.5 of the dead body of Imran there was neither 
inverted margins nor everted margins, volunteered that it was just blackening 
mark of gun powder without any injury..”(emphasis supplied)  
The said opinion and observations of Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-3), that he did not 
observe presence of any injury caused by use of a firearm weapon on the left hand 
of Usman Haider (deceased) and on the left wrist of Usman Haider (deceased) 
and also that  Muhammad Imran (deceased) had suffered from only one injury  on 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
23 
 
his umbilical area and not two, as was stated by the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2), was never 
challenged by the prosecution either during the investigation of the case or during 
the course of the trial. In this manner, the statements of the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) are in direct 
contradiction and in conflict with the opinion and observations of Dr. Kashif Nazir 
(CW-3). The prosecution witnesses very well knew that the observations and opinion 
of Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-3), were in themselves sufficient to shatter the very 
foundation upon which the prosecution case was built, however, even being in 
knowledge of this fact, no effort was made by the prosecution witnesses to challenge 
the observations and opinion of Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-3)  or if the same could not 
be challenged, then to explain the same. Despite our repeated queries, the learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the complainant have failed 
to explain the said discrepancies in the prosecution evidence. In this manner, 
irreconcilable and harrowing contradictions have cropped up in the ocular account 
of the occurrence as narrated by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) and the medical evidence as 
furnished by Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-3). The contradictions in the ocular account of 
the occurrence, as narrated by Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat 
(PW-2)  and the medical evidence as furnished by Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-3), clearly 
establish that the prosecution miserably failed to prove the charge against the 
appellants. The contradictions in the ocular account of the occurrence, as narrated by 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) and the medical 
evidence, as furnished by Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-3), sound the death knell for the 
prosecution case and proves to be the cause of its sad demise. Had the witnesses 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
24 
 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) seen the 
occurrence then there did not exist any possibility that they would fallen into such 
grave error. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Shafi 
alias Kuddoo vs. The State and others ” (2019 S C M R 1045) has held as under:- 
“Ocular account is in conflict with medical evidence inasmuch as according to the 
crime report both the appellant, as well as, Abdul Razzaq, co-accused, are assigned 
one blow each to the deceased, whereas according to the initial medical 
examination, Medical Officer noted solitary injury on the head, its impact on the 
eye has been utilized by the witnesses to array the latter in the crime.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Muhammad Zaman  vs. The State and others 
” (2014 S C M R 749) wherein it has been held as under:- 
“The more so, when the total number of injuries found on the deceased as well as 
the injured could be caused by one or two L.G. Cartridges. The number of 
assailants in the circumstances of the case appears to have been exaggerated” 
Reliance is placed on the cases of “Muhammad Ali Vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 
137) “Muhammad Ashraf Vs. The State” ( 2012 S C M R 419) ,USMAN alias 
KALOO Vs. The State (2017 S C M R 622) ,Muhammad Hussain Vs. The State (2008 
S C M R 345) and “Ain Ali and another Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 323) where 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to reject the evidence of 
prosecution witnesses when the same was found to be in contrast with the medical 
evidence.  
18. 
The scrutiny of prosecution evidence also reflects the falsity of the claims of 
the eye-witnesses ,as the occurrence was completed  within a few minutes and in 
that scenario  it was humanly impossible to provide such minute details in such a 
photographic manner or to assign the specific roles and furnish detailed description 
of the same, while getting the written application (Exh.PA) for the registration of the 
F.I.R  submitted to the Investigating Officer of the case, as has been done in this 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
25 
 
case. The manner  in which minute and complex details of the occurrence, including 
the individual roles of the assailants, have been mentioned in the written application 
(Exh.PA), would rather infer pre inquiry , exploration and detailed considerations, 
as such before the writing of the written application (Exh.PA) and  rules out the 
possibility of truthfulness, spontaneity and extemporaneity in the narrative of the 
written application (Exh.PA) . Specific assignment of multiple fire shots in a crisis 
situation to the appellants and acquitted co-accused by the witnesses in their 
statements recorded by the learned trial court is extremely improbable for the simple 
reason that it was humanly impossible to capture such minute details in a 
photographic manner.  Over anxious photographic account of the occurrence by the 
prosecution witnesses vis-a-vis, the weapon of offence, number and locale of injuries 
allegedly caused by the appellants to the deceased is not only proved to be 
maneuvered but also  improbable and preposterous . As discussed above, despite the 
said details containing the written statement (Exh.PA) of Muhammad Sarwar (PW-
1) ,  the ocular account was proved to be inconsistent with the medical evidence. 
Moreover, both the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) failed to observe the presence of an injury of the 
dimension of 4 cm. x 2.5 cm, present on right side of the skull of the dead body of 
Usman Haider (deceased) , 4cm away from right eye brow, with white brain matter 
out, caused by use of a firearm weapon, which injury was mentioned as injury No.2 
in the Post-Mortem Examination Report (Exh.CW-3/A) as prepared by Dr. Kashif 
Nazir (CW-3). Furthermore, Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-3) also opined that he only 
recovered bullets from the dead body of Usman Haider (deceased)  and did not 
recover any pellets from the said dead body, contrary to the narrative of the 
occurrence as deposed by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
26 
 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) . Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-3) explained 
during cross-examination , as under:- 
“It is correct that I recovered three bullets from the dead body of Usman Haider and 
did not find any pellet projectile in the dead body of Usman Haider as I have 
mentioned above.” 
These  apparent flaws in the statements of both the prosecution witnesses namely 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2), who otherwise 
narrated all the complex and varied details of the occurrence,  have led us to an 
irresistible conclusion that the statements of the witnesses are not worthy of any 
reliance and are to be rejected outright. Guidance is sought from the principle 
enunciated by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Irfan Ali Vs. The 
State” (2015 S C M R 840) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased 
to reject the evidence eye witnesses and held as under:- 
“The most striking feature of the case is that in the FIR complete 
photographic narration of the entire tragedy has been given so much so, 
Muhammad Khan acquitted accused and the appellant were attributed 
causing specific injuries with the fire shots of 30-bore pistols at the 
deceased. With such degree of accuracy each and every detail of the 
incident was given however, it was not due to mental disorientation that 
the dagger blows inflicted on the deceased found during the autopsy on 
the dead body, could not be noticed by the complainant. This doubt of 
reasonable nature and substance would strongly suggest that the 
complainant and the other eye-witnesses were not present at the spot, 
otherwise, lodging the report after more than 3 hours and spending 1-1/2 
hour at the spot with the dead body, no room was left for this glaring 
omission. This omission is very fatal to the prosecution case and it is 
established that crime was an un­witnessed one.”(emphasis supplied)

27 
 
Reliance is placed on the case of “Muhammad Ashraf Vs. The State” ( 2012 S C M 
R 419) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold as under 
“Both the eye-witnesses are not natural witnesses and they claimed that 
they  had seen the incidence but had failed to explain two injuries 
caused with blunt weapon on the forehead and below the left eye of the 
deceased and had only attributed one  injury to the appellant  at the 
back of his ear.”  
Reliance is also placed on the case  of USMAN alias KALOO Vs. The State (2017 S 
C M R 622) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold as 
under:-  
“Some of the above mentioned eye-witnesses had maintained that the 
deceased had received only one injury at the hands of the appellant but 
the Post-mortem Examination Report shows that the deceased had 
received as many as 8 injuries on different parts of his body.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case  of Muhammad Hussain Vs. The State (2008 S C 
M R 345) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold as 
under:- 
“Only one fire-arm injury was attributed to Muhammad Hussain 
petitioner but according to the post-mortem report there was another 
injury on the person of deceased caused with blunt weapon.” 
Guidance is also sought from the principle enunciated by the august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in the case of “Amin Ali and another Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 323) 
where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to reject the evidence of 
injured witnesses and held as under:-  
“11. All the three witnesses deposed that the deceased had received 
three injuries, but the Medical Officer found six injuries on the person 
of the deceased. One of them had blackening. None of the witnesses 
deposed that any of the appellants had caused the injuries from a close 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
28 
 
range but on the contrary in the site plan the place of firing has been 
shown 8 feet away from the deceased. Thus from such a distance injury 
with blackening cannot be caused as it can be caused from a distance 
of less than 3 feet as per Modi's Medical Jurisprudence. The Medical 
Officer did not show as to which of the injury was entry or exit wound 
on the person of the deceased. The medical officer stated that metalic 
projectile was recovered from wound No.1/B which was an exit wound. 
If it was an exit wound then the metalic projectile would have been out 
of the body. The presence of metalic projectile in the body clearly 
establishes the fact that it is not an exit wound but an entry wound. The 
medical officer has not shown that any of the injuries had inverted or 
averted margins so as to ascertain as to which of the injuries is entry 
or exit wound. Thus on this count there is a conflict between the medical 
and oral evidence. Furthermore, according to Medical Officer, the 
P.W.15 had four injuries out of them two were entry and two were 
exit wounds but the P.Ws. 13 and 14 deposed that the injured had 
received three injuries. Thus the P.Ws. have shown one exit wound 
as entry wound. With regard to the injured Tanveer Hussain, the 
Medical Officer showed two injuries one entry wound on the chest and 
one exit wound on the back but all the three eye-witnesses deposed that 
P.W.14 had received two injuries on his chest. As regards injuries on 
the person of Mst. Maqbool Bibi. The Medical Officer found one entry 
wound on her back with blackening, whereas P.Ws. 13, 14 and 15 
deposed that the fire shot was fired from the roof of the shop. Entry 
wound with blackening marks cannot be caused from such a long 
distance. From the above position it is manifest that the ocular 
testimony is in conflict with the medical evidence. Thus, the deceased 
and injured did not receive the injuries in the manner, as alleged by the 
prosecution. 
………………………………. 
13. From the above evidence of the P. Ws., they do not appear to be 
truthful witnesses; therefore, no implicit reliance can be placed on their 
evidence.” 
 
19.      Another aspect of the case raising doubt over the presence of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  at 
the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence, is the fact the matter was reported 
to the police on 16.02.2021 at 03.30 p.m.,  when the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1)  submitted the written application (Exh.PA) to  Ghulam 
Shabbir, Inspector (CW-7)  , the Investigating Officer of the case, whereas the 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
29 
 
occurrence had taken place on 16.02.2021 at 09.30 a.m.. In this manner, the delay 
in reporting the matter to the police was of about six hours, for which delay no 
reason, much less plausible, was offered. No justification, much less credible, has 
been given by the prosecution at any stage for such deferral in reporting the matter 
to the police and the delay in submitting the written application  (Exh. P.A.) by 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1)  to Ghulam Shabbir, Inspector (CW-7). The reason for 
this inordinate delay in reporting the matter to the police by the prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1)  is obvious, being that both the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1)  and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  
were not present at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence and the delay 
was used to procure their attendance. The prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  even admitted that the police 
arrived at the place of occurrence as early as at about 12.00/12.30 p.m, however, the 
written application (Exh.PA) was submitted at 03.30 p.m. The prosecution witness 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1), during cross-examination, stated as under:- 
“ At about 12:00 or 12:30 pm, on that day, police arrived at the spot and inspected 
the place of occurrence. 
………… 
Police remained present at the spot till 03.30 p.m on the day of 
occurrence.”(emphasis supplied)  
Ghulam Shabbir, Inspector (CW-7), the Investigating Officer of the case,  during 
cross-examination, stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
30 
 
“ It is correct that application Exh-PA was submitted before me by the complainant 
as (sic) 3:30 p.m. on 16.02.2021 and it was the first information about the 
occurrence. (emphasis supplied)  
 In this case, the ocular account furnished is suffering from legal and factual 
infirmities and does not appeal to a prudent mind, much less a legal one, because the 
witnesses never reported the matter to the police for as many as six hours. This 
inordinate delay in reporting the matter conclusively proves that the written 
application   (Exh. P.A.) submitted by  Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1)   and the formal 
F.I.R (Exh.PB) were prepared after probe, consultation, planning, investigation and 
discussion and as the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1)  and 
Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  were not present at the place of occurrence, at the 
time of occurrence, the delay was used for procuring their arrival. As many as six 
hours were taken to invent a false and dishonest narrative of the written application  
(Exh. P.A.) of Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) . The scrutiny of the statements of the 
prosecution witnesses reveals that the written application  (Exh. P.A.) of Muhammad 
Sarwar (PW-1) was neither prompt nor spontaneous nor natural, rather was a 
contrived, manufactured and a compromised document. Sufficient doubts have 
arisen and inference against the prosecution has to be drawn in this regard and the 
delay in reporting the matter to the police and the failure of the prosecution witnesses 
to proceed to the Police Station evidences their absence at the time of occurrence, at 
the place of occurrence. Reliance is placed on the case of “Ghulam Abbas and 
another v. The State and another” (2021 SCMR 23) wherein the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan observed as under:- 
“As per contents of F.I.R., the occurrence in this case took place on 19.06.2008 at 
01.40 a.m. and the matter was reported to the Police on the same morning at 07.00 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
31 
 
a.m. and as such there is a delay of more than five hours in reporting the crime to 
the Police whereas Police Station was situated at a distance of just six kilometers 
from the place of occurrence. No explanation whatsoever was furnished by the 
complainant for this delay in reporting the crime to the Police. Hameed Ullah Khan 
SI (PW.15) who investigated the case stated during his cross-examination that he 
reached at the place of occurrence at about 05.00 a.m. and he had completed the 
police proceedings by 06.30 p.m. In the circumstances, chances of deliberations 
and consultations before reporting the matter to the Police cannot be ruled out.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of  “MUHAMMAD ASHRAF JAVEED and 
another vs. MUHAMMAD UMAR and others” (2017 SCMR 199) wherein the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold as under: 
“The hospital is closely situated to the Police Station but neither the complainant 
nor P.W.s took a little pain to report the matter, nor the staff of the hospital 
including the treating doctor took initiative.” 
Guidance is also sought from the principle enunciated by the august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in the case of “Zafar vs. The State  and others” (2018 SCMR 326) where 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold as under:- 
 “It has been observed by us that the occurrence in this case as per prosecution 
took place on 03.09.1999 at 3.00 a.m. (later half of night) and the matter was 
reported to the police on the same day at 8.30 a.m. i.e. after five hours and thirty 
minutes of the occurrence. The distance between the place of occurrence and the 
police station is 09 miles. The postmortem on the dead body of deceased was 
conducted on the same day at 2.00 p.m. i.e. after 11 hours of the occurrence. No 
explanation whatsoever has been given by the complainant Shahadat Ali (PW5) 
and Umer Daraz (PW6) in the F.I.R. or while appearing before the learned trial 
Court qua the delay in lodging the F.I.R. or for that matter the belated postmortem 
of the deceased.” 
Guidance is sought from the principles enunciated by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the cases of “G. M. NIAZ Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 506), “Abdul 
Jabbar and another Vs. The State” (2019 S C M R 129) and “Muhammad Shafi 
alias Kuddoo Vs.  The State and others” (2019 S C M R 1045).  
20. 
We have also noted that the prosecution was  not even able to prove the place 
of occurrence as being the same which was mentioned by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) for the fact 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
32 
 
that according to the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
(Exh.PG)  , the earth which had allegedly been collected from the places where the 
dead bodies of the deceased were found to be present was not of human origin.  The 
relevant portion of the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore  
(Exh.PG) reads as under:- 
“ Description of Evidence as Provided by the Submitting Agency 
1.Soil taken from the place of occurrence of Muhammad Imran. 
2.Soil taken from the place of occurrence of Usman Haider. 
……………….. 
Results and Conclusion  
No human blood was identified on item No. 1 and 2.” (emphasis supplied)  
 
21. 
We have also noted with disquiet that despite the fact that the occurrence took 
place at about 09.30 a.m on 16.02.2021, the post-mortem examinations of the dead 
bodies of the deceased were conducted after much delay. According to Dr. Kashif 
Nazir (CW-3), he conducted the post-mortem examinations of the dead bodies of the 
deceased at 10.30 p.m on 16.02.2021 i.e. after thirteen hours of the occurrence and 
after seven hours of the submission of the written application  (Exh. P.A.) of 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1)  to Ghulam Shabbir, Inspector (CW-7). Dr. Kashif Nazir 
(CW-3) , who conducted the post-mortem examinations of the dead bodies of the 
deceased, gave the time between death and post-mortem examinations of the dead 
bodies as being twelve to fourteen  hours. The learned counsel for the complainant  
stated that the delay in the conducting of the post-mortem examinations of the dead 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
33 
 
bodies of the deceased was due to the fact that earlier the dead bodies were taken to 
RHC Faqirwali, however, subsequently, due to the absence of the Medical Officer , 
were brought to the THQ, hospital Haroonabad, whereafter Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-
3) , conducted the post-mortem examinations of the dead bodies of the deceased. It 
was admitted by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) that the THQ hospital Haroonabad was at a distance 
of just two kilometres from the place of occurrence . Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) , 
during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“ THQ hospital, Haroonabad is situated at a distance of about 2-km away from 
the place of occurrence.” (emphasis supplied)  
When according to the prosecution witness namely  Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) , 
the THQ hospital Haroonabad , where the post-mortem examinations of the dead 
bodies of the deceased were conducted , was at a distance of only two kilometres 
away from the place of occurrence , then there is no explanation  that as to why there 
was such a huge delay  in not only  escorting the dead bodies of the deceased  to the 
THQ hospital Haroonabad but also in the conducting of the post-mortem 
examinations of the dead bodies of the deceased. Dr. Kashif Nazir (CW-3) also 
stated that  it was at 10.20 p.m on 16.02.2021, that he received the complete papers 
though the dead bodies have been brought to the hospital at about 08.00 p.m .Dr. 
Kashif Nazir (CW-3), in his statement before the learned trial court , stated as under:- 
“On the same day, at about 8:00 PM, the dead body of Usman Haider was brought 
by police for his post mortem examination. 
…………. 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
34 
 
On the same day, at about 8:00 PM, the dead body of Muhammad Imran was 
brought by police for his post mortem examination. 
…………. 
 It is correct that I received police papers i.e. injury statement and inquest of 
report of Usman Haider deceased as well as of Muhammad Imran deceased at 
10:20 p.m. which I have mentioned on the injury statement and inquest report of 
Usman Haider as well as on the injury statement and inquest report of Muhammad 
Imran deceased persons.” (emphasis supplied)  
 The reason which is apparent for the delayed conducting of the post-mortem 
examinations of the dead bodies of the deceased  and the delayed submission of 
police papers to the Medical Officer is that by that time the details of the occurrence 
were not known and the said time was used not only to procure the attendance of the 
witnesses but also to fashion a false narrative of the occurrence. No explanation was 
offered to justify the said delay in receiving the complete documents from the police 
and the delay in conducting the post-mortem examinations. These facts clearly 
establish that the witnesses claiming to have seen the occurrence were not present at 
the time of occurrence and the delay in the post-mortem examination was used to 
procure their attendance and formulate a dishonest account, after consultation and 
planning. It has been repeatedly held by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan that 
such delay in the post-mortem examination is reflective of the absence of witnesses 
and the sole purpose of causing such delay is to procure the presence of witnesses 
and to further advance a false narrative to involve any person. The august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Khalid alias Khalidi and two others vs. The State” 
(2012 SCMR 327) has held as under: 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
35 
 
“The incident in the instant case took place at 2.00 a.m, F.I.R. was recorded 
at 4/5 a.m, Doctor Muhammad Pervaiz medically examined the injured 
person at 4.00 a.m. but conducted the post mortem examination of the 
deceased at 3.00 p.m i.e. after about ten hours, which fact clearly shows 
that the F.I.R. was not lodged at the given time”. 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Mian SOHAIL AHMED and 
others vs. The State and others” (2019 SCMR 956) has held as under: 
“According to the Doctor (PW-10), who did the post-mortem examination, 
the dead-body of the deceased was brought to the mortuary at 11:15 a.m. on 
01.9.2006 and the post-mortem examination took place at 12 noon after a 
delay of 15 hours. This delay in the post-mortem examination, when the 
occurrence was promptly reported at 8:45 p.m. and formal F.I.R. was 
registered at 9.00 p.m. on 31.8.2006 gives rise to an inference that the 
incident was not reported as stated by the prosecution” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Rafique alias 
Feeqa vs. The State” (2019 SCMR 1068) has held as under: 
“More importantly, the only person who can medically examine the dead 
body during the said police custody of the dead body is the medical officer, 
and that too, when the same is handed over to him by the police for its 
examination. For the purposes of the present case, it is crucial to note that, 
at the time of handing over a dead body by the police to the medical officer, 
all reports prepared by the investigating officer are also to be handed over 
in order to assist in the examination of the dead body. 
10. 
Thus, once there is suspicion regarding the death of a person, the 
following essential steps follow: firstly, there is a complete chain of police 
custody of the dead body, right from the moment it is taken into custody 
until it is handed over to the relatives, or in case they are unknown, then 
till his burial; secondly, post mortem examination of a dead person cannot 
be carried out without the authorization of competent police officer or the 
magistrate; thirdly, post mortem of a deceased person can only be carried 
out by a notified government Medical Officer; and finally, at the time of 
handing over the dead body by the police to the Medical Officer, all reports 
prepared by the investigating officer are also to be handed over to the said 
medical officer to assist his examination of the dead body. 
11. 
It is usually the delay in the preparation of these police reports, 
which are required to be handed over to the medical officer along with 
the dead body, that result in the consequential delay of the post mortem 
examination of the dead person. To repel any adverse inference for such 
a delay, the prosecution has to provide justifiable reasons therefor, which 
in the present case is strikingly wanting.”

22.       We have already mentioned that along with the appellants their co-accused, 
namely Zain Ali and Salah-ud-Din, both since acquitted by the learned trial court, 
were also tried. The learned trial court acquitted the above mentioned co-accused of 
the charges. We have queried the learned Deputy Prosecutor General and the learned 
counsel for the complainant regarding the filing or otherwise of any appeal against 
the acquittal of the said co-accused, who have stated that the acquittal of Zain Ali 
and Salah-ud-Din, since acquitted by the learned trial court, had attained finality as 
the Petition for Special Leave to Appeal, bearing PSLA No.31 of 2022 , assailing the 
acquittal of Zain Ali and Salah-ud-Din, as filed by the complainant of the case was 
dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated 19.10.2022,  passed by this Court and the 
matter was not agitated any further. The question for determination before this Court 
now is that whether the evidence which has been disbelieved qua the acquitted co-
accused of the appellants can be believed against the appellants. The proposition of 
law in Criminal Administration of Justice, that a common set of witnesses can be 
used for recording acquittal and conviction against the accused persons who were 
charged for the commission of same offence, is now a settled proposition. The august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has repeatedly held that partial truth cannot be allowed 
and perjury is a serious crime. This view stems from the notion that once a witness 
is found to have lied about a material aspect of a case, it cannot then be safely 
assumed that the said witness will declare the truth about any other aspect of the 
case. We have noted that the view should be that "the testimony of one detected in a 
lie was wholly worthless and must of necessity be rejected." If a witness is not 
coming out with the whole truth, then his evidence is liable to be discarded as a 
whole meaning thereby that his evidence cannot be used either for convicting 
accused or acquitting some of them facing trial in the same case. This proposition is 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
37 
 
enshrined in the maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus. The august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in Criminal   Miscellaneous   Application   No.   200   of   2019   in 
Criminal Appeal No. 238-L of 2013 reported as PLD 2019 Supreme Court 527 has 
enunciated the following binding principles: - 
“The Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (P.P.C.) contains many offences dealing 
with perjury and giving false testimony. The very fact that there is a whole 
chapter, numbered XI, dedicated to such offences amply testifies to the fact 
that matters relating to giving of testimony were taken very seriously by 
those who drafted the P.P.C. and their continued retention in the P.P.C. 
ever since reflects the will of the legislature, which is the chosen 
representative body of the people of Pakistan through which they exercise 
their authority within the limits prescribed by Almighty Allah. The following 
sections, listed under Chapter XI titled "Of False Evidence And Offences 
Against Public Justice", highlight the fact that giving false testimony has 
been treated to be a very serious matter entailing some serious punishments. 
………………………………………… 
Holding that the rule falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus is inapplicable in 
this country practically encourages commission of perjury which is a 
serious offence in this country. A court of law cannot permit something 
which the law expressly forbids. 
………………………………………. 
………………………………………. 
21. 
We may observe in the end that a judicial system which permits 
deliberate falsehood is doomed to fail and a society which tolerates it is 
destined to self-destruct. Truth is the foundation of justice and justice is 
the core and bedrock of a civilized society and, thus, any compromise on 
truth amounts to a compromise on a society's future as a just, fair and 
civilized society. Our judicial system has suffered a lot as a consequence 
of the above mentioned permissible deviation from the truth and it is about 
time that such a colossal wrong may be rectified in all earnestness. 
Therefore, in light of the discussion made above, we declare that the rule 
falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus shall henceforth be an integral part of 
our jurisprudence in criminal cases and the same shall be given effect to, 
followed and applied by all the courts in the country in its letter and spirit. 
It is also directed that a witness found by a court to have resorted to a 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
38 
 
deliberate falsehood on a material aspect shall, without any latitude, 
invariably be proceeded against for committing perjury.” 
Guided by the said judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan, we have 
examined the prosecution evidence. We have scrutinized the statements of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat 
(PW-2). The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) in his 
statement before the learned trial court, stated as under:- 
“Accused Zain Ali made a fire shot with his fire arm weapon which hit on the 
left palm of my son Usman Haider. Accused Salaho-u-Din S/O Faqir Hussain 
made a fire shot with his fire arm weapon which hit on left wrist of my son Usman 
Haider.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) in his statement 
before the learned trial court, stated as under:-  
“Accused Zain Ali made a fire shot with his fire arm weapon which hit on the 
left palm of Usman Haider. Accused Salaho-u-Din S/O Faqir Hussain made a 
fire shot with his fire arm weapon which hit on the left wrist of Usman 
Haider.” (emphasis supplied)  
The perusal of the above-mentioned portions of the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  
clearly reveals that according to the said eye witnesses, Zain Ali and Salah-ud-Din, 
the acquitted co-accused of the appellants, caused injuries  to the deceased. We are 
unable to find any independent corroboration of the prosecution case against the 
appellants  and we are  unable to  distinguish the  case  of the appellants from the 
case of acquitted co-accused namely Zain Ali and Salah-ud-Din (since acquitted) 
as the prosecution evidence with regard to the appellants and regarding their co-
accused namely Zain Ali and Salah-ud-Din (since acquitted), is similar, being based 
on the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) 
and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) . Prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad 
Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)   were adjudged to have deposed 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
39 
 
falsely against Zain Ali and Salah-ud-Din (since acquitted). We find no reason to 
believe their statements with regard to the appellants in absence of any reason to do 
so. This lying on the part of the witnesses with regard to Zain Ali and Salah-ud-Din  
(since acquitted) has vitiated our trust in them. We are thus satisfied that the 
evidence of the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2)  has no worth and is to be rejected outright. Both the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Daryafat (PW-2)  have been disbelieved with regard to their allegations against Zain 
Ali and Salah-ud-Din (since acquitted). Reliance in this regard is placed on the case 
of “Tariq Vs. The State” (2017 S C M R 1672) wherein the august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan has held as under:- 
“So the conviction of the appellant can only be sustained if there is 
independent corroboration to the said witnesses who had been 
disbelieved to the extent of majority of the accused which presently is 
lacking because the motive asserted by the prosecution indicates that 
there was enmity of murder between the parties and the said enmity, 
being double edge, could be reason for false implication of the 
appellant.” 
Reliance in this regard is also placed on the case of MUNIR AHMED and others Vs. 
the State and others (2019 S C M R 2006) wherein the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held as under: - 
“Loss of precious lives, within a family fold, though on rocks, 
confirmed by the witnesses including the one with a stamp of injury, 
notwithstanding, there are certain intriguing aspects, haunting the 
prosecution, in the totality of circumstances, a hugely large number 
of assailants, including the unknown, being the most prominent. In the 
face of indiscriminate firing, a case unambiguously put forth by the 
prosecution, receipt of single shot by each deceased as well as the 
injured belies the hypothesis of massive indiscriminate firing by each 
member of unlawful assembly comprising no less than 26, the 
unknown included; from amongst the volley of assailants, precision 
attribution, in an extreme crisis situation, is a feat, beyond human 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
40 
 
capacity, it sans forensic support as well; quite a few from amongst 
the array were let off at investigative stage, on the basis of an affidavit 
sworn by no other than the injured himself; prosecution's dilemma is 
further compounded by acquittal of four accused, framed through the 
same set of evidence by the Trial Court; a severer blow came from the 
High Court that acquitted all others except the petitioners. The 
petitioners, though distinctly assigned single shot qua the deceased 
and the injured, nonetheless, are identically placed with those by now, 
off the hook. Inclusion of the unknown, eight in numbers, if factually 
correct was certainly not without a purpose; if at all, they were there, 
the petitioners and other known members of the family had no 
occasion to carry out the assault without being out of mind. 
Notwithstanding the magnitude of loss of lives, the totality of 
circumstances, unambiguously suggest that the occurrence did not 
place in the manner as is alleged in the crime report; argument that 
number of assailants has been hugely exaggerated, as confirmed by 
the acquittals of the co-accused with somewhat identical roles, though 
without specific attributions, is not entirely beside the mark and in 
retrospect calls for caution. It would be unsafe to maintain the 
convictions. Consequently, Jail Petitions are converted into appeals 
and allowed; impugned judgment is set aside; the appellants are 
acquitted from the charge and shall be released forthwith, if not 
required in any other case.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of SAFDAR ABBAS and others Versus The 
STATE and others (2020 S C M R 219) wherein the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held as under: - 
“Petitioners' father, namely, Charagh co-accused is assigned multiple 
club blows to Muhammad Bukhsh deceased; same is charge against 
Muzaffar co-accused; remainder of the accused, though assigned no 
harm to the deceased, nonetheless, are ascribed effective roles to the 
PWs; they are closely related being members of the same clan and in 
the totality of circumstances given the accusation, their roles cannot 
be bifurcated without nullifying the entire case. Motive cited in the 
crime report is non-specific; investigative conclusions were 
inconsistent with the case set up by the complainant. Recoveries are 
inconsequential. Complainant abandoned his case against the 
acquitted co-accused after failure of his petition seeking leave to 
appeal in the High Court. In this backdrop, no intelligible or objective 
distinction can be drawn to hold the petitioners guilty of the charge in 
isolation with their co-accused. Prosecution evidence, substantially 
found flawed, it would be unsafe to maintain the conviction without 
potential risk of error. Criminal Petition No.955-L/2016 is converted 
into appeal and allowed, impugned judgment is set aside, the 
petitioners/appellants shall be released forthwith, if not required to be 
detained in any other case.”

23. 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the 
complainant, have relied upon the recovery of the Repeater gun (P-19) from the 
appellant namely Muhammad Abbas, the recovery of the rifle (P-21) from the 
appellant namely Mansha, the recovery of the gun (P-23) from the appellant 
Muhammad Ishaq and the recovery of the gun (P-25) from the appellant Usama and 
the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P.H.)  and have 
submitted that they offered sufficient corroboration of the ocular account of the 
occurrence as furnished by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2). The recovery of the Repeater gun (P-19) 
from the appellant namely Muhammad Abbas, the recovery of the rifle (P-21) from 
the appellant namely Mansha, the recovery of the gun (P-23) from the appellant 
Muhammad Ishaq and the recovery of the gun (P-25) from the appellant Usama 
cannot be relied upon as the Investigating Officer of the case did not join any witness 
of the locality during the recovery of the Repeater gun (P-19) from the appellant 
namely Muhammad Abbas, the recovery of the rifle (P-21) from the appellant 
namely Mansha, the recovery of the gun (P-23) from the appellant Muhammad Ishaq 
and the recovery of the gun (P-25) from the appellant Usama , which action of his 
was in clear violation of the provisions of the section 103 Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898 and therefore the evidence of the recovery of the Repeater gun (P-
19) from the appellant namely Muhammad Abbas, the recovery of the rifle (P-21) 
from the appellant namely Mansha, the recovery of the gun (P-23) from the appellant 
Muhammad Ishaq and the recovery of the gun (P-25) from the appellant Usama 
cannot be used as incriminating evidence against the appellants, being evidence 
which was obtained through illegal means and hence hit by the exclusionary rule of 
evidence. The provisions of section 103 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022

unfortunately, are honoured more in disuse than compliance. To appreciate it 
better, this section is being reproduced:- 
"103.--(1) Before making a search. under this chapter, the officer or other 
person about to make it shall call upon two or more respectable 
inhabitants of the locality in which the place to be searched is situate 
to attend and witness the search and may issue an order in writing to 
them or any of them so to do. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Ismail and others 
Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 898) at page 901 has held as under:- 
“For the above mentioned recovery of weapons the prosecution had failed to 
associate any independent witness of the locality and, thus, the mandatory 
provisions of section 103, Cr.P.C. had flagrantly been violated in that regard.” 
We have also noted that the prosecution failed to establish the safe custody of the 
empty shells of the bullets and cartridges collected from the place of occurrence  to 
the police station and from the Police Station to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore .According to the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Azhar 775/HC 
(CW-6) stated that  on 16.02.2021, the Investigating Officer of the case , handed 
over to him one sealed parcel said to contain   the empty shells of the bullets collected 
from the place of occurrence  and one sealed parcel said to contain   the empty shells 
of the cartridges collected from the place of occurrence  and he handed over the said 
two sealed parcels to Shaukat Ali, ASI (CW-5) for their onward transmission to the 
office of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. Similarly, Shaukat Ali, ASI 
(CW-5) also stated that on 22.02.2021, Muhammad Azhar 775/HC (CW-6) one 
sealed parcel said to contain   the empty shells of the bullets collected from the place 
of occurrence  and one sealed parcel said to contain   the empty shells of the 
cartridges collected from the place of occurrence  for their onward transmission to 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
43 
 
the office of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore . Muhammad Azhar 
775/HC (CW-6), in his statement before the learned trial court stated as under:- 
“Stated that on 16.02.2021 I was posted at police station Faqirwali as Moharrer. On 
the same day, I.O. handed over me two sealed parcels of blood stained earth of the 
deceased Imran and Usman Haider, one sealed parcel containing 3-empties and 
one sealed parcel of cartridges, ………….” (emphasis supplied)  
Shaukat Ali, ASI (CW-5) in his statement before the learned trial court stated as 
under:- 
“Stated that on 22.02.2021 I was posted at police station Faqirwali. On the same 
Moharrer handed over to me two sealed parcels of blood stained earth, one sealed 
parcel of cartridges of 12. Bore gun and a parcel of empties 44-bore rifle 
bearing seal SA,7-parcels of crime scene Unit, 4-envelopes of Khaki Colour sealed, 
5-jars sealed by THQ hospital, Haroonabad for PFSA Lahore,…” (emphasis 
supplied)  
Contrary to the statements of Muhammad Azhar 775/HC (CW-6) and Shaukat Ali, 
ASI (CW-5) that one sealed parcel said to contain   the empty shells of the bullets 
collected from the place of occurrence  and one sealed parcel said to contain   the 
empty shells of the cartridges collected from the place of occurrence  was transmitted  
to the office of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, according to the report 
of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PH), four sealed parcels 
containing the said empties were deposited at the said agency. The relevant portion 
of the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PH) reads as 
under:- 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
44 
 
 ” 
Therefore, it is proved on record that the safe custody and safe transmission of the 
empty shells of the bullets and cartridges collected from the place of occurrence to 
the police station and from the Police Station to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore could not be proved. In this manner, the recovery of the Repeater gun (P-19) 
from the appellant namely Muhammad Abbas, the recovery of the rifle (P-21) from 
the appellant namely Mansha, the recovery of the gun (P-23) from the appellant 
Muhammad Ishaq and the recovery of the gun (P-25) from the appellant Usama 
could not be proved and cannot be considered as a relevant fact for proving any fact 
in issue.  
24. 
With regard to the recovery of  the motorcycle (P-18) from the appellant 
namely Muhammad Abbas, it is observed that the witnesses neither during the 
investigation of the case and nor before the learned trial court mentioned the 
registration number, colour or any other detail of the motorcycle used by the 
appellants to arrive and flee away from the place of occurrence so as to relate the 
recovery of  the motorcycle (P-18) from the appellant namely Muhammad Abbas 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
45 
 
with the motorcycle used on the day of the occurrence. The prosecution witnesses 
namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) in their 
statements did not even state that the accused were having any motorcycle . 
Therefore, the recovery of  the motorcycle (P-18) from the appellant namely 
Muhammad Abbas cannot be considered as a relevant fact for proving any fact in 
issue. 
25. 
  
Learned Deputy Prosecutor General  and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and submitted that it 
corroborated the ocular account. The motive of the occurrence as stated by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and Muhammad Daryafat 
(PW-2) was that the deceased namely Usman Haider was named as an accused 
regarding the murder of Aqib Haroon, son of the appellant namely Mansha and as 
the deceased namely Usman Haider was acquitted by the learned trial court , 
therefore, he was murdered along with Muhammad Imran by the appellants. It was 
admitted by the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Daryafat (PW-2) that  it was not only Usman Haider (deceased) who 
was named as an accused in the case registered with regard to the murder of Aqib 
Haroon (deceased) but  others namely Aurangzeb and Allah Ditta were also named 
as accused in the said case.  The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Sarwar 
(PW-1) also admitted that Usman Haider (deceased) was acquitted by the learned 
trial court one year before the present occurrence, with no untoward incident taking 
place during the said period. The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Sarwar 
(PW-1) during cross-examination , admitted as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
46 
 
“ It is correct that one year prior to this occurrence, the above-mentioned FIR of 
Mansha accused was decided and the accused persons of said FIR namely Usman 
Haider, Aurangzeb and Allah Ditta were acquitted from the charges volunteer that 
the son of accused Mansha was murdered by above named Allah Ditta.” 
The above referred portion of the statement of  the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Sarwar (PW-1) ,  clearly proves that the prosecution witnesses failed to 
provide evidence enabling us to determine the truthfulness of the motive alleged, 
and the fact that the said motive was so compelling that it could have led the 
appellants to have committed the Qatl-i-Amd of both the deceased.  There is a 
haunting silence with regard to the minutiae of motive alleged. No independent 
witness was produced by the prosecution to prove the motive as alleged.  Even 
otherwise a tainted piece of evidence cannot corroborate another tainted piece of 
evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of Muhammad 
Javed v. The State (2016 SCMR 2021) as under: 
“The said related and chance witnesses had failed to receive any 
independent corroboration inasmuch as no independent proof of 
the motive set up by the prosecution had been brought on the record 
of the case.” 
 
Furthermore, it is settled law that motive is a double-edge weapon, which can cut 
either way; if it  was the reason for the appellants to have murdered the deceased, 
it equally was a ground for the complainant to falsely implicate them in this case. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of Muhammad Ashraf 
Alias Acchu v. The State (2019 S C M R 652) as under:- 
“7.         The motive is always a double-edged weapon. The complainant 
Sultan Ahmad (PW9) has admitted murder enmity between the parties 
and has also given details of the same in his statement recorded before 
the trial court. No doubt, previous enmity can be a reason for the 
appellant to commit the alleged crime, but it can equally be a reason for 
the complainant side to falsely implicate the appellant in this case for 
previous grouse.”

Reliance is also placed on the case of “Liaqat Ali and 11 others v. The State” (1992 
S C M R 372) wherein it has been held as under:- 
“In this behalf, it may be observed that the motive is a double‑edged 
weapon which could be one of the reasons for false implication as well 
as has been held by the Supreme Court in the case of Allah Bakhsh and 
another v. The State (PLD 1978 SC 171).” 
 
26. 
Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in our 
minds regarding the involvement of the appellants namely Muhammad Ishaq son of 
Muhammad Nawaz, Muhammad Ilyas son of Muhammad Nawaz, Muhammad 
Abbas son of Muhammad Nawaz, Mansha son of Muhammad Nawaz  and Usama 
son of Mohsin in the present case. It is a settled principle of law that for giving the 
benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there should be so many circumstances 
rather if only a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in the mind of a 
prudent person is available then such benefit is to be extended to an accused not as 
a matter of concession but as of right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of “Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the 
following principle: 
“Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an accused it 
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubt. If 
there is a circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind 
about the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be entitled to the 
benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and concession, but as a 
matter of right. It is based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty persons 
be acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted". Reliance in this 
behalf can be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The State (1995 SCMR 
1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State (2008 SCMR 1221), 
Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and Muhammad 
Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749).” 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has been observed as 
infra: 

Murder Reference No. 08 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal    No. 205 of 2022 
 
48 
 
“9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is not a 
ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete justice. This is an 
established principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 guilty 
persons should let off but one innocent person should not suffer. As the 
preeminent English jurist William Blackstone wrote, "Better that ten 
guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer." Benjamin Franklin, 
who was one of the leading figures of early American history, went 
further arguing "it is better a hundred guilty persons should escape than 
one innocent person should suffer." All the contradictions noted by the 
learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of doubt on the 
prosecution's case, which entitles the petitioner to the right of benefit of 
the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for the accused to be 
afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there 
should be many circumstances creating uncertainty and if there is only 
one doubt, the benefit of the same must got to the petitioner. This Court 
in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying 
on the the earlier judgments of We have categorically held that "if a 
single circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about 
the apprehension of guilt of an accused, then he/she shall be entitled to 
such benefit not as a matter of grace and concession, but as of right. 
Reference in this regard may be made to the cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. 
The State (1998 SCMR 1345) and Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 
SC 1048)." The same view was reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 
SCMR 129) when this court observed that once a single loophole is 
observed in a case presented by the prosecution, such as conflict in the 
ocular account and medical evidence or presence of eye-witnesses being 
doubtful, the benefit of such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution's case 
automatically goes in favour of an accused.”
