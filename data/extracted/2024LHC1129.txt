Petitioner 
has 
sought 
interpretation of Clause 3 of the Scheme for the Management and 
Disposal of Urban Evacuee Trust Properties, 1977 (the “Scheme”) 
from the Court by applying Doctrine of Textualism as developed by 
this Court in “SERVICE GLOBAL FOOT WEAR LIMITED versus 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others” (PLD 2023 Lahore 471) 
whereby the Court held that statute should be interpreted according to 
its plain meaning and not according to the intent of legislature.

dated 13.03.2023 was dismissed. The Petitioner has also prayed to set

II. 
BRIEF BACKGROUND 
3. 
Facts as narrated in this petition are that the Petitioner and his 
deceased brother Muhammad Ali (husband of the Respondent No.5) 
(the “deceased tenant”) had been jointly dealing with their business as 
tenants in Shop No.49 of Building No.U/1442 vide Demand No.1-
1711-1-1997-O, situated at Macca Cloth Market, Raja Bazar, 
Rawalpindi (the “Rented Shop”). After the demise of the “deceased 
tenant” in year 2005, two applications for change of tenancy were 
moved respectively by the Petitioner and the Respondent No.5 before 
the Respondent No.3, which were dismissed vide order dated 
03.11.2022, against which appeals were preferred before the 
Respondent No.2 by the Petitioner and the Respondent No.5. These 
appeals were accepted vide order dated 30.12.2022 with a direction to 
the Respondent No.3 to process the case for change of tenancy as per 
law and whilst passing fresh order. On submission of applications by 
the parties for change of tenancy, the Respondent No.3 vide order dated 
16.02.2023 changed the tenancy in favour of the Respondent No.5. 
Before the above said order was challenged, the said Respondent 
passed another order dated 13.03.2023 against which revision petition 
of the Petitioner was dismissed vide order dated 05.04.2023, hence this 
petition.  
III. 
PETITIONER’S SUBMISSIONS 
4. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner Raja Israr Ahmad Abbasi 
ASC inter alia argued that the Petitioner, being real brother, was 
sharing the business with the “deceased tenant” and, after his demise, 
he is entitled to the tenancy rights being one of the legal heirs; that the 
impugned orders have been passed in oblivious of the “Scheme”; that 
the “deceased tenant” died issueless and after his demise, the 
Petitioner, being co-sharer in the “Rented Shop” is in possession and 

Writ Petition No.1479 of 2023                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   3 
running the business therein, as such, he is entitled to tenancy rights in 
terms of Clause 3(III)(B)(b) of the “Scheme”; that just to oust the 
Petitioner from the “Rented Shop”, its rent has been increased by the 
Respondents by misconstruing Clause 3(III)(A)(a) of the “Scheme”; 
that the impugned orders have been passed by the Respondents with 
connivance of the Respondent No.5, as such, they are liable to be set 
aside. 
IV. 
SUBMISSIONS OF RESPONDENTS NO.1 TO 4. 
5. 
Learned law officer filed report and parawise comments on 
behalf of the Respondents No.1 to 4 according to which the Petitioner 
is an illegal occupant on the “Rented Shop” and he has not produced 
any document of his joint business with the deceased before the 
competent authority and the Respondent/ETPB in compliance of 
direction of Secretary/Revisional Authority, Ministry of Religious 
Affairs, Islamabad contained in order dated 05.04.2023 sealed the 
“Rented Shop” on 14.04.2023. It has further been stated that the

V. 
SUBMISSIONS OF RESPONDENT NO.5 
6. 
Reply of this petition was also filed on behalf of the Respondent 
No.5. Ms. Tanzeela Nazar, Advocate controverted the stance of the 
Petitioner and inter alia argues that the “deceased tenant” was carrying 
on business in the “Rented Shop” in his sole capacity and, after his 
demise, the Petitioner took over possession at spot and the tenancy was 
terminated by the Respondents No.1 to 4 due to default in payment of 
rent and illegal occupation; that Clause 3(III)(B)(b) of the “Scheme is 
not applicable to the case of the Petitioner as he remained fail to prove 
sharing of business with the “deceased tenant” in the “Rented Shop”; 
that the impugned orders are well reasoned, legal and have lawfully 
been passed by the Respondents No.1 to 4.  
7. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the 
available record.

VI. 
DETERMINATION  
 
8. 
It is not a disputed fact by the parties that the “deceased tenant” 
died issueless in year 2005. It had all started in year 2022, when the 
Petitioner and the Respondent No.5 first time respectively moved 
applications before the Respondent No.3/Deputy Administrator for 
transfer of tenancy rights in their favour being legal heirs of the 
“deceased tenant”. The said Respondent vide order dated 03.11.2022 
cancelled the tenancy rights of sub-unit reflected in the name of the 
“deceased tenant” on the ground of illegal occupation by the Petitioner 
and default in payment of rent thereof. The said order was assailed 
through appeals by the parties before the Zonal Administrator, which 
were dismissed vide order dated 30.12.2022 and the matter was 
remanded to the Respondent No.3 with direction to process the case for 
change of tenancy rights as per law. Pursuant to aforesaid, the 
Respondent No.5 filed application on 16.01.2023 for transfer of 
tenancy on the ground of being legal heir of the “deceased tenant” 
while the Petitioner filed application on 18.01.2023 for change of 
tenancy rights in his favour being a sharer in business with the 
“deceased tenant”. Both afore-stated applications were decided by the 
Respondent No.3 vide order dated 16.02.2023 by dismissing the 
application of the Petitioner due to non-production of partnership deed 
and allowing that of the Respondent No.5 by ordering for transfer of 
tenancy rights in her favour, which were transferred under Clause 
3(iii)B of the “Scheme” vide order dated 13.03.2023. Being aggrieved 
thereof, the Petitioner filed revision petition before the Respondent 
No.2, who upheld the order of the Respondent No.3 vide his order 
dated 05.04.2023, relevant portion of the same is reproduced hereunder: 
 “The impugned property was under the tenancy 
of Muhammad Ali S/o Abdul Shakoor, who died 
on 30.03.2005. The petitioner and respondent 
No.4 on 03.11.2022, submitted applications for 
change of tenancy in their favour. The main 
stance of the petitioner is that he is in possession 
of impugned property and running his business 
alongwith recorded tenant, therefore, tenancy 

Writ Petition No.1479 of 2023                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   5 
should be transferred in his name alongwith 
respondent No.4 being legal heirs of deceased 
tenant. During the arguments it transpires that the 
petitioner has no partnership deed and is in 
illegal occupation of the impugned property. The 
department after fulfilling all legal aspect 
transferred the tenancy right in favour of Mst. 
Zareen Ali wd/o Muhammad Ali as per clause 
3(iii)B of the Scheme, 1977”.  
 
9. 
Pertinently, Chapter III (Residential/Commercial Buildings and 
Plots) of the “Scheme” deals with the tenancy, while sub-clause III 
deals with change of tenancy. The said clause reads as under: 
(iii) Change of tenancy may be allowed by a District Officer, an 
Administrator or the Chairman in respect of a unit / sub-unit carrying 
rent upto rupees one thousand per month, from rupees one thousand and 
one to rupees three thousand per month and exceeding rupees three 
thousand per month, respectively, in the following cases:-  
 
(A) 
On the express consent, in writing of the previous tenant, 
the change of tenancy may be allowed by a District 
Officer, an Administrator or the Chairman, as the case 
may be, on the following terms and conditions:-  
(a) 30% increase in the existing rent;  
(b) Payment of transfer fee equal to two years rent at the 
newly fixed rate in the case of residential unit / sub-unit 
and equal to four years rent in the case of commercial 
unit / sub-unit provided that a residential-cum-
commercial unit / sub-unit shall be treated as a 
commercial unit sub-unit for the purposes of levy of 
transfer fee;  
(c) Payment of outstanding arrears of rent or any other 
dues out standing; and  
(d) execution of tenancy agreement by the new tenant; 
 
(B) 
On the demise of a tenant the tenancy of a unit / sub-unit 
shall be alienable in favour of the legal heir(s), indicated in the 
schedule of tenancy deed; Provided that:-  
(a) the condition (a) and (b) mentioned in clause (A) 
above shall not be applicable to the case of change of 
tenancy in favour of legal heir(s) of deceased tenant;  
(b) if the real brother(s) of father of the deceased tenant were 
/ was sharing the business in a commercial unit / sub-unit 
with the deceased tenant, they / he shall also be eligible for 
the change of tenancy alongwith other; legal heir(s); and 
in case of change of tenancy in favour or legal heirs on the 
demise of tenant a representative shall be nominated by the 
legal heirs from amongst themselves who shall be 
responsible to pay the rent and to abide by all the terms and 
conditions of the tenancy, individually and severely.

Bare reading of Clause III of the “Scheme” reveals that District 
Officer, an Administrator or the Chairman are empowered to change 
the tenancy with the conditions mentioned under the above referred 
clause. While Clause (III)(B) of the “Scheme” demonstrates that the 
tenancy of unit/sub-unit shall be alienable in favour of the legal heirs 
indicated in the schedule of tenancy deed subject to conditions 
incorporated under Clause (III)(B)(a) and (b) of the “Scheme”. 
Notably, two semicolons are used in aforesaid clause, first after the 
words “change of tenancy alongwith other” and the second after the 
words “legal heir(s)”. Generally, the semicolon is an indication of the 
legislature’s intention to deal with different issues within the single 
section of a statute or a clause of the scheme. The semicolon makes the 
division between the two parts of the sentence a little more prolonged 
than a comma. The first semicolon used after the expression “change of 
tenancy alongwith other” means any other claimant beside 
brother/father sharing business at the spot, whereas aforementioned 
second semicolon after the word “legal heir(s)” is intended for scope 
of change of tenancy at spot in favour of above-mentioned claimants 
and legal heirs indicated in the schedule of tenancy deed. In the case in 
hand, two persons are claiming tenancy rights under the “Scheme”; one 
is the Petitioner (brother of the “deceased tenant”) who is claiming 
tenancy rights being co-sharer and legal heir of the “deceased tenant” 
in the “Rented Shop” while the second is the Respondent No.5, who is 
claiming such right being exclusive legal heir of her deceased husband. 
During the course of hearing, the Court confronted to counsel for the 
parties to place on record the schedule of tenancy deed as mentioned 
under Clause 3(III)(B) of the “Scheme”, however, it has not been 
placed on record by either of the party.  
10. 
The Petitioner in order to establish his right of tenancy in the 
“Rented Shop” has annexed with the petition copy of Income Tax 
Return for the period ending on 30.06.2004, copy of notice of ejectment 
dated 18.11.2022, copy of letter dated 17.04.2023 and copy of rent Bill 
relating to month March-April 2023. Additionally, C.M.No.1824 of 
2023 to place on record certain documents had also been filed, which 

Writ Petition No.1479 of 2023                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   7 
include application for verification of legal heirship of the “deceased 
tenant” submitted before the Tehsildar, Rawalpindi by Mst. Kishwar 
Jahan (sister of the deceased), according to which the deceased left 
behind Mst. Zareen Akhtar (widow), Mehmood Ali and Yaqoob Ali 
(brothers) and Mst. Noor Jahan, Mst. Kishwar Jahan, Mst. Shahnaz 
Akhtar, Mst. Zakira, Mst. Yasmeen and Mst. Ghazala (sisters). He has 
also annexed photocopies of payment receipts regarding payment of 
rent in connection with the “Rented Shop” in favour of the Evacuee 
Trust Property Board from the year 2000 to 2022 alongwith copy of 
FIR dated 25.08.2023 and some approval bills issued by Shakoor Cloth 
Store. Likewise, the counsel for the Respondent No.5 also filed 
C.M.No.2404 of 2023 and placed on record list of sub-unit master file 
issued by the Deputy Administrator, Evacuee Trust Property Board, 
Rawalpindi. Whereas the counsel for the Respondents No.1 to 4, 
though filed report and parawise comments yet attached only copy of 
FIR dated 25.08.2023, notice to SHO, PS, Ganj Mandi, Rawalpindi 
regarding sealing of the “Rented Shop”, notice to the Petitioner for 
vacation of the “Rented Shop” dated 17.04.2023 and copy letter dated 
18.04.2023 addressed to C.P.O, Rawalpindi.  
11. 
Surprisingly, the husband of the Respondent No.5 died in year 
2005 and none of the party ever tried to approach to the Respondents 
No.1 to 4 for change of tenancy right under the “Scheme”. The parties 
first time approached the Respondents in year 2022 by submitting their 
respective applications, consequently, the impugned orders have been 
passed, perusal of which reveal that at the one hand, the Petitioner has 
been declared as illegal occupant over the “Rented Shop” and ousted 
him therefrom due to non-production of partnership deed while on the 
other hand, the Respondents have transferred the tenancy rights in 
favour of the Respondent No.5 without resolving the issue of legal 
heirship of the Respondent No.5 and nothing finds discussed or 
justified as to how the tenancy rights have been transferred solely in 
her favour under Clause 3(iii)(B) of the “Scheme” without first 
determining rights of other legal heirs of the “deceased tenant”, as 
elaborated above. No effort whatsoever has been set forth by the 

Writ Petition No.1479 of 2023                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   8 
Respondents No.1 to 4 for the purpose of verification, ascertainment 
and determination of legal heirs of the “deceased tenant”, particularly 
when he had passed away issueless. As such, the impugned orders 
have been passed without affording opportunity of hearing to the other 
legal heirs of the deceased. Notwithstanding claim of the Petitioner of 
his holding a joint business with the “deceased tenant” over the 
“Rented Shop”, it was legally incumbent upon the Respondents No.1 
to 4 to have determined status and entitlement of other legal heirs of 
the “deceased tenant” in the course of proceedings eventuating in 
orders in question passed by them. Parties are subject of the “Scheme” 
and their rights qua the “Rented Shop” are required to be determined 
in accordance with provisions contained therein. The Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has reiterated the principle in “Messrs Tri-Star Industries 
(Pvt.) Limited Vs. TRISA BURSTENFABRIK AG TRIENGEN and 
another” (2023 SCMR 1502) and has held that “Where the law 
prescribes a thing to be done in a particular manner following a 
particular procedure, it shall be done in the same manner following 
the provisions of law without deviating from the prescribed 
procedure, and where a power is given to do a certain thing in a 
certain way the thing must be done in that way or not at all.” 
Determination of status and entitlement of legal heirs of the 
“deceased tenant” was an utmost required and added obligation of 
the Respondents No.1 to 4 in light of repeated guidelines of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan stressing hard on the subject, one 
instance whereof is the case “FAIZ ULLAH and others versus 
DILAWAR HUSSAIN and others” (2022 SCMR 1647), where it has 
been held that “It is a settled proposition of law that at the time the 
inheritance of a deceased Muslim opens, all the entitled legal heirs 
become owners to the extent of their shares there and then.” The 
Respondents No.1 to 4, in course of proceedings in question, have not 
attended and addressed question of legal heirship of the “deceased 
tenant” and thus have skipped following the law thereby frustrating 
and defying intent and requirement of law as well as extinguishing 
rights of legal heirs of the “deceased tenant”, which course adopted by 

Writ Petition No.1479 of 2023                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   9 
them is otherwise in clear deviation to the principle audi alteram 
partem, in connection whereto the Supreme Court of Pakistan has held 
in case “Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Chief 
Secretary and others Vs. Muhammad Khurshid” (2021 SCMR 369) 
that “The learned High Court ought to have followed the principle of 
audi alteram partem and due process, which are basis of 
administration of justice, specially when any order, if passed, might 
affect the rights of the entity not party to the proceedings.” To all 
extents, the issue raised in this petition pertains to determination of 
rights of legal heirs, which is a question of fact and cannot be resolved 
by this Court in constitutional jurisdiction.  
12. 
It is pertinent to mention here that request of the parties to 
interpret Clause 3 of the “Scheme” in the light of doctrine of 
textualism cannot be dealt with by this Court as Clause 3(III)(B)(b) of 
the “Scheme” cannot be interpreted in absence of schedule of tenancy 
mentioned under the aforesaid clause. Moreover, the schedule of 
tenancy has neither been provided by either of the parties before this 
Court nor before the authorities at the time of passing orders and the 
parties never approached the concerned authorities for more than 
seventeen years for determination of their rights of legal heirship.  
13. 
The Court at this stage cannot determine issue of change of 
tenancy of the parties by interpreting Clause 3 of the “Scheme” 
because the words used in Clause 3(B) state that on demise of the 
tenant, the unit shall be alienable in favour of his legal heirs. No 
schedule of legal heirs indicating the legal heirs of demised tenant is 
available on record and in absence thereof the Court cannot determine 
onward fate of transfer of tenancy with regard to subject matter.  
14. 
When confronted, parties in attendance admitted that neither 
they are available with nor the record indicates any legal heirs in 
schedule of tenancy. Therefore, the request of learned counsel for the 
Petitioner to interpret Clause 3(III)(B)(b) of the “Scheme” cannot be 
entertained at this stage because both the parties rely upon respective 
provisions discussed afore necessitate determination regarding status 
of legal heirs of the “deceased tenant” for transfer of tenancy, but 

Writ Petition No.1479 of 2023                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   10 
stance of none of the parties may be responded positively until and 
unless status of legal heirs of the “deceased tenant” is determined by 
authorities concerned.  
15. 
In view of above discussion, the writ petition is allowed and the 
impugned orders are hereby set aside. The matter is remitted to the 
Respondent No.3 with a direction to decide it afresh keeping in view 
Clause 3(iii)(B) of the “Scheme”, elaborated above, after hearing all 
necessary parties and taking into consideration the documents produced 
by them, if any.
