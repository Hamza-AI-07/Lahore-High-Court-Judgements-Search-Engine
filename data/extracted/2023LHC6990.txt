RAHEEL KAMRAN, J. – Through the instant petition under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(„the Constitution‟) the petitioner while alleging to be the bonafide 
purchaser in possession of the property bearing No.8-A, Shabbir Road, 
Lahore Cantt. and relying upon the judgment dated 28.08.2020, passed 
by the High Court of Balochistan, Quetta, has prayed that the restriction 
placed by the Military Estate Officer, Walton Cantonment, Lahore 
Cantt/respondent No. 3 over the said property may be declared to be 
without lawful authority and he be directed to remove the said 
restriction and provide him with the copy of the GLR after entering 
name of the petitioner in his record as lawful owner of the said 
property. 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner purchased plot 
No.8/A, comprising Survey No. 176/8/A, total land measuring 506.2 
Sq.Yds. situated at Shabbir Road, Lahore Cantt., out of which 1/3rd  
share was owned by Nisar Hussain Shah (respondent No.4), who sold it 
by execution of a sale deed registered with the Sub-Registrar, Aziz 
Bhatti Town, Lahore Cantt. on 27.08.2016, vide Document No. 5558, 
Book No. 1, Volume No.2256. Subsequently, when the petitioner 

2 
Writ Petition No.58871 of 2022 
 
 
approached respondent No.3 to enter his name in the GLR, he came to 
know that with respect to 1/3rd share of respondent No.4 a freezing 
order was passed by the NAB authorities on 18.02.2009 which was 
confirmed by the Accountability Court, Quetta on 21.11.2009. Cr. 
Ehtisab Appeal No.07/2011 was filed to challenge the order of the 
Accountability Court, Quetta dated 21.11.2009, which was partially 
allowed vide order dated 30.11.2011 whereby the case was remanded to 
the trial Court after setting aside the impugned order. Subsequently, 
vide judgment dated 04.10.2013 passed by the Accountability Court-II, 
Balochistan, Accountability Court Reference No.12/09 filed by the 
NAB against respondent No.4 was ultimately dismissed and he was 
acquitted from the charges including the property in dispute. Against 
that, NAB preferred Criminal Acquittal Ehtesab Appeal No. 06 of 2013 
challenging  acquittal of respondent No.4, which was also dismissed by 
the High Court of Balochistan, Quetta vide judgment dated 28.08.2020 
against which leave to appeal has been sought by the NAB through 
Criminal Petition No.1243 of 2020 filed before the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that respondent No.4 
from whom the petitioner has purchased the property in dispute stands 
acquitted from the charge of acquiring the said property from 
corruption and corrupt practices by the trial Court and the appeal filed 
thereagainst has also been dismissed. He maintains that though the 
NAB has challenged the acquittal of respondent No.4 before the 
Supreme Court but till-date no leave granting order has been passed and 
double presumption of innocence is attached to the acquittal of 
respondent No.4 by the trial Court as maintained by the High Court in 
appeal. He emphasizes that at present there is no freezing order in field, 
therefore, there exists no legal justification for refusal to remove 
restriction over the property in question. He finally contends that 
respondent No.3 is legally bound to enter name of the petitioner in the 
record as lawful owner of the property in question and issue him a copy 
of GLR to which he is entitled under the law.

Writ Petition No.58871 of 2022 
 
 
4. 
Conversely, learned Special Prosecutor for NAB opposed the 
instant petition by arguing that the petitioner purchased the property in 
dispute from respondent No.4 during the pendency of the NAB‟s appeal 
against his acquittal by the Accountability Court-II, Balochistan, Quetta 
which was in violation of section 23 of the National Accountability 
Ordinance, 1999 („the Ordinance‟). It is contended that section 23 ibid 
places an embargo on transfer or creating any charge on the property 
owned and possessed by the accused during the pendency of the trial. 
He further submits that respondent No.4 sold the property in dispute to 
the petitioner during the pendency of the appeal against his acquittal 
and the appeal being continuation of the trial, such transfer of the 
disputed property in the name of the petitioner was void and unlawful. 
He concludes his arguments while stating that acquittal of respondent 
No.4 has not been finalized so far since the same has been still assailed 
before the Supreme Court of Pakistan where Criminal Petition No.1243 
of 2020 is pending adjudication. 
5. 
Learned Deputy Attorney General for Pakistan has also 
supported the arguments advanced by the learned Special Prosecutor, 
NAB. 
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
7. 
Opposition of the instant petition is based on two grounds: firstly, 
sale of the property in dispute during the pendency of the appeal was in 
violation of section 23 of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, 
secondly, the NAB has filed Criminal Petition No. 1243 of 2020 against 
acquittal of respondent No.4 which is pending adjudication before the 
apex Court. 
8. 
Prior to its omission on 22nd June 2022 through the National 
Accountability (Amendment) Act, 2022 [Act No. XI of 2022], section 
23 of the Ordinance read as follows: 
23. Transfer of property void.- 
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law 
for the time being in force after the Chairman NAB has 
initiated an inquiry or investigation into any offence 

4 
Writ Petition No.58871 of 2022 
 
 
under this ordinance, alleged to have been committed by 
an accused person, accused person or any relative or 
associate of accused person or any other person on his 
behalf, shall not transfer by any means whatsoever, or 
create a charge on any property owned by him or in his 
possession, 
while 
the 
inquiry, 
investigation 
or 
proceedings are pending before the NAB  or the Court; 
and any transfer of any right, title or interest or creation 
of charge on such property shall be void.  
(b) 
Any person who transfers, or creates a charge on 
property in contravention of subsection (a) shall be 
punishable with the rigorous imprisonment for a term, 
which may extend to 3 years and shall also be liable to 
fine not exceeding the value of the property involved; 
Provided that such transfer of any right, title or interest 
or creation of a charge on such property shall not be void 
if made with the approval of the Court, subject to such 
terms and conditions as the Court may deem fit”. 
9. 
It is noteworthy that the proviso to section 23 ibid was inserted in 
Ordinance pursuant to the direction issued by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of Khan Asfandyar Wali and others Vs. Federation 
of Pakistan through Cabinet Division, Islamabad and others (PLD 
2001 SC 607) wherein, inter alia, vires of the Ordinance were assailed 
for violation of fundamental rights embodied in Chapter 1 of Part II of 
the Constitution to reflect that transfer of property by an accused person 
or any relative or associate of such person or any other person on his 
behalf or creation of charge on any movable or immoveable property 
owned by him or in his possession, while inquiry, investigation or 
proceedings before the Accountability Court was pending, not to be 
void if made with approval of the Court subject to such terms and 
conditions as the Court deems fit. 
10.   The purpose and object behind promulgation of section 23 of the 
Ordinance has been expounded by the Supreme Court in the case of 
Khan Asfandyar Wali (Supra) in the following terms:- 
“Section 23 ibid is an interlocutory measure to prevent 
persons accused of such offences to frustrate the objects 
of law by creating third party interest in respect of 
illegally acquired property, thereby creating hurdles in 
the object of law i.e. to eradicate corruption and corrupt 
practices and hold accountable all those persons 
accused of such practices and matters ancillary thereto. 
The purpose of this power is more to preserve the 

5 
Writ Petition No.58871 of 2022 
 
 
property acquired by the accused through corruption 
and corrupt practices so that ultimately if the guilt is 
proved the same can be taken back from him in 
accordance with law. Section 23 of the NAB Ordinance 
is also preventive in nature and prescribes penalties for 
the accused person who attempts to alienate or transfer 
by any means property after the Chairman NAB has 
initiated investigation, inquiry or proceedings have 
commenced against him in an Accountability Court. Put 
differently, it is in the nature of a restraint order. The 
protective measures are not by way of punishment but 
with a view to ensure that the final decision is not 
rendered redundant.”   
11. 
Punishment for the offence of corruption and corrupt practices 
has been prescribed under Section 10 of the Ordinance not only in 
custodial terms but includes, amongst others, forfeiture to the 
appropriate government or the concerned financial institution such 
assets and pecuniary resources as are found to be disproportionate to 
the known sources of income or which are acquired by money obtained 
through corruption and corrupt practices, whether in the name of the 
holder of the convict or any of his dependents or benamidars. Section 
23 ibid, as held by the Supreme Court in the case of Khan Asfandar Yar 
Wali (Supra), provides for an interlocutory measure to prevent persons 
accused of corruption and corrupt practices to frustrate the objects of 
law.       
12. 
In the instant case, respondent No.4 sold the property in question 
to the petitioner on 27.08.2016 after his acquittal by the Accountability 
Court-II, Quetta vide judgment dated 04.10.2013 in Accountability 
Reference No.12 of 2009 and during pendency of the Criminal 
Acquittal Ehtisab Appeal No.06 of 2013. One of the primary questions 
would be to ask whether provisions of the repealed section 23 of the 
Ordinance extended in their application to the cases in appeals before 
the High Court under the Ordinance?  
13. 
Since section 23 of the Ordinance not only restricted the exercise 
of fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 23 and 24 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 but also 
prescribed an offence under section 23(b) ibid, therefore, it could only 
be construed strictly. The word “Court” used in section 23 of the 

6 
Writ Petition No.58871 of 2022 
 
 
Ordinance has been defined in section 5(g) the Ordinance to mean the 
Accountability Court. It does not include the High Court. An 
amendment was made in section 9(b) by insertion of phrase “including 
High Court” through Ordinance No. IV of 2000 to eclipse authority of 
the High Court to grant bail in cases under the Ordinance, however, 
such statutory prohibition could not abridge or takeaway jurisdiction of 
the High Courts to grant bail under Article 199 of the Constitution to 
any person accused of an offence under the Ordinance, as held by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases of Khan Asfandyar Wali and 
others Vs. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2001 SC 607) and 
Muhammad Iqbal Khan Noori and others v. National Accountability 
Bureau and others (PLD 2021 SC 916). The distinction between the 
Court and the High Court, as maintained by the Ordinance, is equally 
manifest from section 32 which provides the remedy of appeal against 
final judgment of the Court before the High Court to be heard by a 
Bench of not less than two judges. It is one of the cardinal principles of 
interpretation of criminal statutes that such enactments are not to be 
extended by construction. In the case of Mirza Shaukat Baig and others 
Vs. Shahid Jamil and others (PLD 2005 SC 530), the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan quoted with approval the following passage of lord Halsbury 
from the English Judgments reported as (1891) AC 107 and (1952) AC 
189:  
“ It seems to me that, construing the statute by adding to 
it words which are neither found there in north for which 
authority could be found in the language of the statute 
itself, is to sin against one of the most familiar rules of 
construction, and I am wholly unable to adopt the view 
that, where a statute is expressly said to codify the law, 
you are at liberty to go outside of the code so created, 
because before the existence of that code another law 
prevailed. In the construction of statute the duty of the 
Court is limited to interpret the words used by the 
legislature and it has no power to fill in any gaps 
disclosed. To do so would we do use of the function of the 
legislature”. 
14. 
The proviso inserted in section 23 of the Ordinance which 
provided a remedy to any person to seek approval of transfer from the 
Court, entailed inquiry into facts that could not be held in appeal before 

7 
Writ Petition No.58871 of 2022 
 
 
the High Court. This lent an additional justification for not extending 
application of Section 23 ibid to the High Court.    
15. 
For the above reasons, we are of the view that after conclusion of 
the trial resulting in acquittal of an accused, the restriction imposed by 
law under section 23 comes to an end and provisions of the said section 
do not extend in their application to the High Court. Be that as it may, 
upon admission of an appeal against acquittal, High Court is possessed 
of all powers of the trial Court to pass any incidental order qua freezing 
of assets under section 12 of the Ordinance read with section 423 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 which mutatis mutandis applies to 
the proceedings under the Ordinance as mandated by Section 17(a) of 
the Ordinance.   
16. 
 Adverting now to the second plea of the NAB that the instant 
petition be dismissed inasmuch as filed Criminal Petition for Leave to 
Appeal has been filed before the Supreme Court to assail acquittal of 
respondent No.4 against dismissal of the Criminal Acquittal Ehtisab 
Appeal No.06 of 2013. In this regard, it is noted that an acquittal carries 
double presumption of innocence and the same could be reversed only 
when found blatantly perverse, illegal, arbitrary, capricious or 
speculative, shocking or arrested impossibility. Reliance in this regard 
is placed on judgments of the Supreme Court in the cases of Mst. 
Anwar Begum Vs. Akhtar Hussain alias Kaka and 2 others (2017 
SCMR 1710) and Muhammad Shafi alias Kuddoo Vs. The State and 
others (2019 SCMR 1045).  
17. 
 On the last date of hearing, the learned Law Officer had sought 
some time to place on record a copy of the aforesaid Criminal Petition. 
However, that has not been done. Even during the course of hearing 
today we have asked the learned Special Prosecutor for NAB about the 
leave granting order and/or restraining order, if any, passed by the 
Supreme Court but he has not produced any such order for perusal of 
this Court. In this scenario, we are of the view that acquittal earned by 
respondent No.4 from the trial Court and upheld by the Appellate Court 
still holds the field.  

8 
Writ Petition No.58871 of 2022 
 
 
18. 
There is admittedly a registered sale deed in favour of the 
petitioner which is a title document. We are of the firm opinion that 
unless and until operation of judgment of the High Court of Balochistan 
dated 28.08.2020 is suspended or stay against transfer or alienation of 
the property in question is granted by the Supreme Court, there stands 
no legal impediment in the way to seek removal of any restriction 
placed on the property purchased by the petitioner from respondent 
No.4 who succeeded in earning an acquittal from the learned trial Court 
that was maintained by the High Court in appeal. The moment final 
judgment in the trial Court was announced, restriction under section 23 
ibid came to an end and became inoperative, therefore, respondent No.4 
was free to transfer the property in question in the exercise of his rights 
guaranteed by Articles 23 and 24 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Therefore, we cannot refuse a relief in this 
case in absence of any order passed by the Supreme Court restricting 
transfer of property, merely on the assertion that NAB has filed a 
petition for leave to appeal.  
19. 
For the foregoing reasons, we allow this writ petition with a 
direction to respondent No.3 to remove the restriction placed on the 
property in question, enter name of the petitioner in his official record 
and provide him a copy of the GLR in accordance with law within 
thirty days of presenting a certified copy of this judgment unless 
otherwise the NAB obtains and produces before the aforementioned 
respondent any order passed by the Supreme Court restricting such 
transfer. There shall be no order as to costs.
