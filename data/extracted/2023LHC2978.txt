********************* 
MASUD ABID NAQVI, J.  Brief facts necessary for the adjudication of 
this lis are that the plaintiff /respondent No.1 filed a suit for specific 
performance and possession with the averments that defendant 
No.9/respondent No.2 was the owner of disputed plot which was 
purchased by the predecessor in interest of defendant Nos. 1 to 
8/petitioners namely Abdul Shakoor through agreement to sell dated 
20.11.2008 after paying the total sale consideration. Thereafter, the 
predecessor in interest of defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners namely 
Abdul Shakoor agreed to sell the same plot to the plaintiff 
/respondent No.1 through agreement to sell dated 25.01.2011 by 
receiving an amount of Rs.5000/- cash & Rs.495000/- through 
cheque which was duly encashed as earnest money and also received 
the balance sale consideration on 16.11.2011 with the promise to 
transfer the title of disputed plot, after completion of process of LDA

on his agreement to sell dated 20.11.2008. After his death, the 
plaintiff repeatedly asked the defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners to 
execute the sale deed but they refused, hence the suit. The defendant 
Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners contested the suit by filing written statement 
and raising certain legal as well as factual objections while defendant 
No.9/respondent No.2 was proceeded against ex-parte by the learned 
trial court. 
2. 
Out of divergent pleadings of the parties, issues were framed 
by the learned trial court. The parties produced their respective 
evidence and after recording the same, learned trial court decreed the 
suit of the plaintiff/respondent No.1 vide judgment and decree dated 
23.10.2018. Feeling aggrieved, the defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners 
filed an appeal and learned Additional District Judge vide judgment 
& decree dated 17.11.2020 dismissed the appeal. Being dissatisfied, 
the petitioners/defendant No.1 to 8 have filed the instant Revision 
Petition and challenged the validity of the judgments and decrees 
passed by the learned courts below. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners 
primarily argued that the predecessor in interest of defendant Nos. 1 
to 8/petitioners namely Abdul Shakoor was not legally entitled to 
execute the disputed agreement to sell on the basis of agreement to 
sell, without being owner of disputed plot while the Learned counsel 
for the plaintiff/respondent No.1 fully supported the judgments and 
decrees of learned courts below and learned counsel for LDA/ 
defendant No.10/respondent No.3 also supported the arguments of 

C.R. No.63321-2020

learned counsel for the petitioners and the defendant No.9/ 
respondent No.2 was proceeded against ex-parte on 07.06.2021. 
4. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties 
and minutely gone through the record as well as the impugned 
judgments and decrees. 
5. 
The disputed plot was originally owned by Muhammad Bilal/ 
defendant No. 9/respondent No.2 as admitted by all the contesting 
parties including Lahore Development Authority/ defendant No.10/ 
respondent No.3 and agreement to sell dated 20.11.2008, executed 
by the Muhammad Bilal/ defendant No. 9/respondent No.2 in favour 
of the predecessor in interest of defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners 
namely Abdul Shakoor is also an admitted document and has not 
been challenged by either of the contesting party and in written 
statement, LDA/defendant No.10 acknowledged the filing of transfer 
application by Muhammad Bilal/defendant No. 9/respondent No.2 in 
favour of the predecessor in interest of defendants No. 1 to 
8/petitioners namely Abdul Shakoor. Assistant Director LDA 
appeared as DW-1 and conceded in cross examination that 
predecessor of the defendants No. 1 to 8/ petitioner namely Abdul 
Shakoor also submitted set of documents for transfer of plot on 
08.10.2011 which includes affidavits of Abdul Shakoor and 
Muhammad Bilal and same are available in the record of LDA.  
Now the onus to prove issue No.3 about the valid execution of 
agreement to sell dated 25.01.2011/Ex.P-2 lies on the plaintiff/ 
respondent No.1 which was allegedly executed by the predecessor in 
interest of defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners in favour of plaintiff/ 

C.R. No.63321-2020

respondent. There is no denial of the fact that the predecessor in 
interest of defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners namely Abdul Shakoor 
received an amount of Rs.4,95,000/- through cheque No. 723191 
which was duly encashed. Although, defendant No.1/petitioner No.1 
conceded in cross examination that he read the bank statement of his 
late father but has not specifically denied the receipt of amount 
through cheque by his father in cross-examination as DW-2 and the 
plaintiff/respondent exhibited his Bank statement/Ex.P-3 to prove 
that an amount of 4,95,000/- was withdrawn from his account 
through cheque No. 723191. The plaintiff/respondent No.1 himself 
appeared as PW-1 & produced two attesting witnesses namely Rana 
Zahid Hussain & Fiaz Bajwa as PW-2 & PW-3 to prove the 
execution and contents of agreement to sell as well as payment of an 
amount of Rs.5000/- in cash & Rs. 4,95,000/- through cheque No. 
723191. The plaintiff/respondent No.1 also produced Manager of 
Bank as PW-6 and after checking/examining the bank record, he 
deposed about the clearance of cheque No. 723191 in favour of 
predecessor in interest of defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners namely 
Abdul Shakoor. The plaintiff/ respondent No.1 also exhibited the 
receipt of balance sale consideration of Rs.850000/- as Ex.P-1 and 
also produced the witnesses of receipt namely Faisal Sadique & 
Manzoor Hussain as PW-4 & PW-5 to prove the execution and 
contents of receipt as well as payment of balance sale consideration 
of an amount Rs. Rs.8,50,000/-. By producing two attesting 
witnesses of agreement to sell dated 25.01.2011/Ex.P-2 alongwith 
the Bank Manager & two attesting witnesses of receipt of balance 

C.R. No.63321-2020

sale consideration/ Ex.P-1, both the documents are proved by the 
plaintiff/petitioner in accordance with the requirements of Article 79 
of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order 1984. 
After successfully proving the Ex-P-1 & Ex.P-2, the onus 
shifts on the defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners to negate the claim of 
plaintiff/respondent No.1 but only the defendant No.1/petitioner 
No.1 appeared as DW-2 and no one else appeared on behalf of 
defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners in support of the stance of 
defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners. 
In admitted agreement to sell dated 20.11.2008 executed by 
the Muhammad Bilal/defendant No. 9/respondent No.2 in favour of 
the predecessor in interest of defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners 
namely Abdul Shakoor, the executant namely Muhammad Bilal 
specifically allowed Abdul Shakoor to execute another agreement to 
sell with someone else on the basis of agreement to sell dated 
20.11.2008 and to receive earnest money. Relevant portion of the 
said agreement is reproduced hereunder:- 
  یہ کہ مقزالیہ اقزار نامہ معاہدہ  بیع ہذ

The predecessor in interest of defendant Nos. 1 to 8/petitioners 
namely Abdul Shakoor acted in accordance with stipulated terms & 
conditions of 1st agreement to sell dated 20.11.2008 by executing 
the 2nd agreement to sell dated 25.01.2011/Ex.P-2 in favour of 
plaintiff/respondent and the predecessor in interest of defendant Nos. 
1 to 8/petitioners namely Abdul Shakoor was legally authorized to 
execute the 2nd agreement to sell in favour of plaintiff/respondent 

C.R. No.63321-2020

and after executing the 2nd agreement to sell voluntarily by late 
Abdul Shakoor, his successors in interest/defendants No. 1 to 
8/petitioners cannot wriggle out of the commitment of late Abdul 
Shakoor as argued by the learned counsel for the petitioners or 
pleaded in Para VI of the grounds of instant civil revision. In this 
regard guidance is sought from the following reported judgments:- 
(i) Muhammad Jalil and 4 others Vs Muhammad Sami and 
8 others (PLD 2007 Lahore 467) 
“the second  party, (فزیق دویم), had specifically been 
granted authority to enter into an agreement with a 
third party without the intervention of the original 
owners. The said clause in effect amounted to the 
purchaser being an authorized attorney of the original 
owners, capable of executing agreements as of right, in 
favour of third parties.” 
 
(ii) 
Mst. Jaiwanti Bai vs Messrs Amir Corporation and 
others (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 434) 
“22.  An assignment, in cases relating to immovable 
property, takes place when one party to an existing 
contract (as in this instant case the under the agreement 
to sell) conveys all the obligations, rights and interest 
under the agreement to another person.” 
 
(iii) Nisar Ahmed Afzal vs Muhammad Taj and 7 others 
(2013 SCMR 146) 
In law, there is no bar for a prospective purchaser 
under a sale agreement, from alienating his interest in 
immovable property acquired by virtue of a sale 
agreement to any other person through another sale 
agreement.” 

C.R. No.63321-2020

6. 
Both the learned Courts below have properly discussed in 
detail the pleadings as well as oral and documentary evidence 
adduced by both the parties and have elaborately discussed the 
factual as well as legal controversy between the parties and arrived at 
right conclusion, hence, the findings of the learned Courts below are 
hereby upheld/confirmed. Even otherwise, with respect to 
interference in concurrent findings of the courts below, the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case reported as Administrator, Thal 
Development through EACO Bhakkar and others Vs Ali Muhammad 
(2012 SCMR 730) held that:- 
“Concurrent findings of the trial court and appellate 
court in favour of appellants were based on proper 
appreciation of evidence therefore, the same were not 
open to interference by the revisional court in exercise 
of its jurisdiction under section 115, C.P.C. which is 
primarily meant for correction of jurisdictional 
defect/error and material illegalities/irregularities, 
resulting in miscarriage of justice to a party.”  
 
7. 
Neither any misreading or non-reading of evidence on record 
nor any infirmity, legal or factual, has been pointed out in the 
impugned judgments and decrees passed by the learned Courts 
below, therefore, this revision petition is dismissed.
