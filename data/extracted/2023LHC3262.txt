MAIN CASE. 
2. 
Briefly put, while serving as Junior Clerk in 
the office of Chief Executive Officer, District 
Education Authority, Pakpattan (respondent No.3) 
the petitioner was transferred to Government High 
School, 
88/EB, 
Arifwala, 
vide 
order, 
dated 
25.05.2023, against which he filed departmental 
appeal before the Director Public Instructions (DPI), 
Secondary Education, Punjab, Lahore (respondent 
No.2). Since the appeal of the petitioner was not 
being decided he filed appeal (No.2410/2023) before 
the Punjab Service Tribunal (PST), Lahore which 
was decided through order, dated 29.05.2023, 
directing respondent No.2 to decide the departmental

Order with signature of Judge, and that of

appeal of the petitioner. Aggrieved of order, dated 
29.05.2023, passed by PST, the petitioner has filed 
this petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits 
that according to the documents brought on record by 
the petitioner through miscellaneous application 
(C.M. No.3 of 2023), while issuing direction for 
decision of appeal of an employee the PST held in 
abeyance the orders challenged in the appeal but in 
the matter of the petitioner said relief has not been 
granted, thus, it is case of clear discrimination. 
4. 
When posed with the query as to how instant 
petition is maintainable as the order passed by PST 
can be challenged before the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in terms of Article 212(3) of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(the Constitution), learned counsel for the petitioner 
while referring to the case reported as Dean/Chief 
Executive Gomal Medical College, Medical Teaching 
Institution, D.I. Khan v. Muhammad Armaghan Khan 
and others (PLD 2023 SC 190) submits that since 
appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 
is not maintainable against an order passed by PST

instant petition. 
5. 
After hearing learned counsel for the 
petitioner and going through the documents, 
appended with this petition, in particular the afore-
referred judgment, I have noted that in prayer clause 
of this petition the petitioner has challenged his 
Transfer Order, dated 25.05.2023, but at the rostrum 
learned counsel for the petitioner has also impugned 
validity of order, dated 29.05.2023, passed by PST.  
 
6. 
While 
dealing 
with question 
regarding 
maintainability of appeal against order of a Tribunal, 
the Apex Court of the country in the referred case has 
inter-alia held as under: - 
 
10. 
The creation of an Administrative 
Tribunal is at the discretion of the relevant 
legislature; it is not mandatory for it to do so. 
One point to keep in mind is that the 
(exclusive) 
jurisdiction 
conferred 
on 
a 
Tribunal created under clause (1) need not be 
in respect of all the matters that can come 
within the scope of para (a); it may be that it 
is exercised only in relation to some of such 
matters. But if such a Tribunal is created, that 
in any case takes the matter to clause (2). This 
clause also opens with an identically worded 
non-obstante 
clause, 
i.e., 
it 
overrides 
"anything herein before contained". In respect 
of a Tribunal created by Federal legislation it 
has automatic effect, mandatorily excluding 
the jurisdiction of any other court to "grant an 
injunction, make any order or entertain any 
proceedings in respect of any matter to which

S.No. of order/ 
proceeding 
Date of order/ 
proceeding 
Order with signature of Judge, and that of 
parties or counsel, where necessary 
 
the jurisdiction of such Administrative Court 
or Tribunal extends". All judicial remedies 
are therefore closed as soon as the relevant 
legislation comes into force. The only such 
door left open is provided by clause (3), which 
provides for a right of appeal to this Court in 
terms as stated therein. Federal legislation 
therefore presents no special problem. The 
real problem is in relation to a Tribunal 
created by Provincial legislation. Here, the 
proviso to clause (2) becomes applicable. This 
provides that a Provincial Assembly may (but 
is not required to) pass a resolution asking 
Parliament to extend clause (2) to the 
Tribunal created by it, and on such resolution 
Parliament may (but is not required to) enact 
the necessary legislation in this regard. If 
both these stages are crossed the proviso 
becomes applicable, and the effect then is the 
same as in the case of Federal legislation: all 
judicial remedies are closed and the only 
avenue for redress is an appeal to this Court 
in terms of clause (3).

20. 
The conclusions arrived at above 
require certain directions to be given, keeping 
in mind that leave petitions and appeals under 
clause (3) of Article 212 may well be pending 
from Tribunals not covered by the proviso to 
clause (2), and many such petitions and 
appeals appear to have been decided and 
disposed of in the past. We are of the view 
that matters must therefore be regularized in 
the following terms: 
 
 
 
a. 
It is held that no appeal lies to 
this Court in terms of Article 212(3) 
against the decision of a Tribunal 
created by a Provincial law to which 
the proviso to clause (2) has not been

Order with signature of Judge, and that of

applied. Any such leave petitions and 
appeals as are pending, being not 
maintainable, 
must 
be 
returned 
forthwith by the Office and no such 
leave petitions are to be entertained 
in future; 
 
 
 
b. 
Nothing in sub-para (a) above 
applies in relation to the following: 
 
i. 
Leave 
petitions 
and/or 
appeals that already stand 
decided 
or 
disposed 
of 
(including by way of having 
been withdrawn or remanded 
or 
otherwise 
dealt 
with), 
whether by way of a detailed 
judgment or a short order 
whether announced orally or in 
writing 
and 
regardless 
of 
whether in respect of any such 
matter detailed reasons are 
awaited, all such matters being 
regarded as past and closed; 
 
ii. 
Leave 
petitions 
and/or 
appeals in which judgment is 
reserved, unless the concerned 
Bench directs otherwise; 
 
iii. 
Leave 
petitions 
and/or 
appeals that are part heard, 
unless the Bench concerned 
directs otherwise; 
 
iv. Such pending leave petitions 
and/or appeals as may be 
directed by the Hon'ble Chief 
Justice. 
 
 
 
 
 
c. 
A litigant to whom a leave 
petition or appeal has been returned 
in terms of sub-para (a) or by reason 
of anything contained in sub-para (b), 
and who chooses or wishes to avail 
another remedy before any other 
forum as may be available under law 
shall have the benefit of section 14 of 
the Limitation Act, 1908 if any 
question of limitation arises or (as the 
case may be) equivalent equitable

d. 
The Registrar shall ensure that 
a copy of this judgment is forthwith 
sent to the registrars of all Tribunals 
to which sub-para (a) applies and the 
said registrars shall immediately 
bring it to the attention of the 
Chairpersons and members of the 
said Tribunals. It shall be the 
responsibility of each Chairperson to 
ensure that till such time as the 
proviso to clause (2) of Article 212 
becomes applicable to the Tribunal, 
the following (or similar) legend is 
suitably incorporated in the title page 
of each decision thereof for the 
benefit of all litigants: 
 
 
"This Tribunal is not covered 
by the proviso to clause (2) of 
Article 212 of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan and therefore no leave 
petition or appeal lies to the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in terms of clause (3) 
of the said Article." 
 
From the above, it is crystal clear that the remedy of 
appeal before the Apex Court of the country against 
an order of Administrative Tribunal, established 
through a provincial enactment, is not available until 
and unless the Parliament, by law, extends the 
provisions of Article 212(2) of the Constitution to 
include a Court or Tribunal established under 
provincial law. Insofar as the case in hand is 
concerned, admittedly, the impugned order has been

Order with signature of Judge, and that of 
parties or counsel, where necessary 
 
passed by PST, established pursuant to adoption of a 
bill by the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab which 
was assented to by the Governor of Punjab, on 
20.06.1974. Now the question further boils down to 
the effect as to whether clause 2 of Article 212 of the 
Constitution was extended to PST or not, to see as to 
whether remedy of appeal, before Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, against any order passed by it is 
available to an aggrieved party or not. The Provincial 
Service Tribunals (Extension of Provisions of 
Constitution) Act, 1974 was promulgated, on 
02.05.1974, section 2 whereof reads as under: - 
“2. Provisions of Article 212(2) to extend to 
Provincial Service Tribunals: The provisions 
of clause (2) of Article 212 of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan shall 
extend to the Service Tribunals respectively 
established under Acts of the Provincial 
Assemblies of the North-West Frontier 
Province, the Punjab and Sind.”  
 
According to the afore-quoted enactment, the 
provisions of Article 212(2) of the Constitution have 
been extended to PST, hence, the present case stands 
distinguished from the referred case inasmuch as the 
Tribunal, whose order was subject matter of the 
referred case, was not extended the provisions of 
Article 212(2) of the Constitution.

 Since remedy of appeal before Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan is available to the 
petitioner against an order passed by PST and remedy 
of appeal is also available against Transfer Order, 
dated 25.05.2023, instant petition is not maintainable 
which is accordingly dismissed with the observation 
that the petitioner would be at liberty to approach the 
forum concerned, for redressal of his grievance.
