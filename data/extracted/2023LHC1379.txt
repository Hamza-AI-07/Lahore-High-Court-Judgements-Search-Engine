Date of hearing:     29.03.2023. 
Applicant by: 
Mr. Imran Rasool, Advocate. 
Respondent by: 
Mr. Hameed Bukhsh, Advocate.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant Reference Application under Section 133 of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 (“the Ordinance of 2001”), following questions 
of law, urged to have arisen out of impugned order dated 
04.12.2012, passed by learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, 
Lahore (“Appellate Tribunal”), have been proposed for our 
opinion:- 
1. 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the 
learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue was justified in 
deleting the addition made on account of capital gain tax under 
Section 37 of the Income Tax Ordinance?  
2. 
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the 
learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, without having any 
material before it for cross checking, is justified in holding that the 
addition covers the parameters of Section 97 of the Ordinance 
and delete the addition without making any comparison with 
them? 
 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondent-taxpayer, a public 
limited company, deriving income from manufacturing and sale of 
juices, pickles, jams, ketchups etc., filed income tax return for the 
tax year 2004 declaring income at Rs.79,967,801/-, which was 
taken to be deemed assessment as per Section 120 of the Ordinance, 
however, it was found to be erroneous insofar as prejudicial to the 

 
 
PTR No.147 of 2013 
 
2
interest of revenue. Consequently, the assessment was amended by 
putting in additions on account of capital gains under Section 37 of 
the Ordinance of 2001 thereby disallowing the expense on R&M of 
the vehicles. The respondent-taxpayer filed appeal before 
Commissioner (Appeals), who, vide order dated 13.06.2011, 
disposed of the appeal in the manner that addition made under 
Section 21(k) of the Ordinance was confirmed whereas addition of 
lease rentals & vehicle expenses at Rs.828,735/- was deleted, and 
regarding donation, it was directed that credit of donation made to 
approved institutions may be allowed while calculating the tax 
liability of the taxpayer. Feeling aggrieved, respondent preferred 
second appeal before learned Appellate Tribunal, which was 
disposed of vide order dated 04.12.2012 and the addition of 
Rs.99,640,500/- made by the Additional Commissioner Inland 
Revenue under Section 37 of the Ordinance of 2001, which was 
confirmed by the Commissioner (Appeals), was deleted being 
illegal and void ab-initio. 
3. 
Learned Legal Advisor for applicant-department submits that 
learned Appellate Tribunal was not justified in deleting the addition 
made on account of capital gains under Section 37 of the Ordinance 
of 2001. He adds that without making any comparison, Appellate 
Tribunal has deleted the addition without having any material 
before it for the purpose of cross-checking in order to satisfy the 
parameters provided in Section 97 of the Ordinance ibid, which is 
absolutely without any legal justification.  
4. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for respondent-taxpayer defends 
the impugned order by contending that merger of wholly owned 
subsidiary is fully covered under the provisions of Section 97 of the 
Ordinance of 2001, thus, no gain or loss shall be taken to arise on 
disposal of its assets.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
Perusal of record reveals that respondent-company had a 
subsidiary company with the name and style of ‘M/s Hattar Juices 

 
 
PTR No.147 of 2013 
 
3
(Pvt.) Limited’, which was merged into respondent-company 
pursuant to Court’s order. The ACIR held that as per scheme of 
arrangement approved by the Board, ordinary shares of M/s Hattar 
held legally or beneficially by respondent-company were cancelled 
and in lieu, all assets and liabilities of M/s Hattar vested in M/s 
Shezan International Ltd., Lahore, thus, disposal in terms of Section 
75 took place as respondent parted with the ownership of those 
shares at that time. Commissioner (Appeals) while dealing with the 
issue of capital gains on merger, observed that the value of assets 
received in lieu of shares is the consideration received against the 
cancellation of shares, and that the respondent-company became the 
owner of assets of M/s Hattar after scheme of amalgamation was 
affected. Whereas learned Appellate Tribunal held that the 
conditions enumerated in Section 97 of the Ordinance of 2001 were 
fully fulfilled, thus, Section 37 of the Ordinance was not attracted.  
7. 
It is apparent that pursuant to this Court’s order dated 
02.12.2003, passed in C.O. No.65 of 2003, M/s Hattar Fruit 
Products Limited merged into respondent-company under the 
scheme of arrangement for merger / amalgamation. It is well-settled 
that merger of two or more companies is essentially a process of 
corporate reconstruction whereby assets of merging companies 
were either clubbed or brought together in the surviving or new 
company, however, proprietary rights of assets remained intact. No 
financial transaction could be said to have taken place between the 
merging companies. As such in the scheme of merger arrangement, 
there does not take place any sale, disposition, exchange or 
relinquishment or extinguishment of any right on the part of the 
amalgamating companies that gives rise to any income or gain 
resulting in a taxable event. If upon merger, the net assets of the 
merging companies remain unaltered as also the proprietary interest 
of the shareholders in the amalgamated company remains the same, 
a corporate merger does not give rise to any taxable event.

8. 
A merger does not give rise to any financial transaction to 
create a taxable event and no cash payment is involved in any 
manner. Amalgamation does not involve any sale or purchase and 
any surplus of value of shares issued by the amalgamated company 
over the value of one asset transferred does not result in any taxable 
gain. Reliance is placed upon a judgment of Delhi High Court 
reported as CIT (Delhi) v. Bhahrat Development (Pvt.) Limited (135 
ITR 456), which was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court of 
India in a number of decisions. 
9. 
While dealing with somewhat similar proposition, the 
Division Bench of Bombay High Court in judgment reported as 
Forbes Forbes Campbell and Company Ltd. v. Commissioner of 
Income-Tax [(1983) 37 CTR Bom 212], while referring to page 
411 of the judgment of Calcutta High Court reported as Shaw 
Wallace & Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner Of Income-Tax [(1979) 119 
ITR 399], has observed as under:- 
“9. According to Banerji J. (p. 411) : 
“The entire capital and assets of the transferor-companies 
having vested in the assessee, as a result of the said 
amalgamations, the assessee became the sole owner of the 
capital of the transferor-companies. There was, therefore, no 
extinguishment of the right of the assessee in participating in 
the capital on the liquidation of the transferor-companies. 
The assessee was a party to the said schemes of 
amalgamation and consented and agreed to the same 
whereunder, as noted earlier, no shares were to be issued to 
the assessee in lieu of or in exchange for the shares held by 
it in the transfer-companies. The shares held by the 
assessee in the transferor-companies represented the 
capital invested by the assessee in the said companies and 
by the said amalgamations the assessee became the sole 
owner of the entire capital of the transferor-companies. By 
virtue of the said amalgamations the assessee as the 
transferee-company became the sole repository of all the 
rights which flowed from or were imbedded in the shares 
held by the assessee in the transferor-companies.” 
10.  
In other words, it has been observed by the learned 
judge of the Calcutta High Court that the result of the 
amalgamation was not securing of any additional amount or 
asset by the assessee-company but blending of the assets 

 
 
PTR No.147 of 2013 
 
5
of the transferor-company with it, and, in pursuance of that 
scheme of amalgamation, there was the abolition of the 
shares in the transferor-company which shares earlier 
represented the said assets. Whether the assets of the 
transferor-company exceeded its liabilities or whether the 
assets were less than the liabilities would seem to make no 
difference and there would be no capital gains or capital loss 
to the assessee-company, since the assessee-company 
continued to enjoy in a different manner what it already 
owned. We may point out that earlier, at p. 409, Justice Sen 
of the Calcutta High Court has looked behind the facade of 
the transaction and lifted the corporate veil to come to the 
identical conclusion. In his view, there was rearrangement of 
the capital base, for instead of keeping the capital in the 
name or in the control of its subsidiaries, the assessee 
brought back the same under its direct control. He has also 
opined that, in this situation, there cannot be any element of 
gain or loss.” 
 
10. 
Amalgamation of the wholly-owned subsidiary company 
with its parent company does not result in transfer for consideration 
and, therefore, does not give rise to any capital gains. The liability 
to capital gains tax (if any) can only be on the transferor company 
(subsidiary), which in the instant case has lost its identity and 
ceased to exist. M/s Hattar, which got amalgamated with the 
respondent-company, is a hundred percent subsidiary of the 
respondent. By virtue of the amalgamation, all the assets and 
liabilities of M/s Hattar became the assets and liabilities of the 
respondent-company. Where the amalgamating company, which is 
a hundred percent subsidiary, merges with the holding company 
(amalgamated company), no question of any profit or gain would 
arise because the amalgamating company (wholly owned 
subsidiary), on amalgamation ceases to exist, and its identity 
merges completely with the amalgamated company; where 
however, in case the amalgamating company receives nothing but 
the shareholders receive shares of the amalgamated company, there 
is no question of capital gains in the hands of the amalgamating 
company since it is the shareholders who receive consideration (if 
any). That in an amalgamation where no shares are issued by the 
amalgamated company, because the amalgamating company was a 

 
 
PTR No.147 of 2013 
 
6
wholly owned subsidiary, no question of capital gains can arise 
because the amalgamating company does not receive any 
consideration.  
11. 
The Supreme Court of India, in judgment reported as 
General Radio & Appliances Co. Ltd. v. M.A. Khader (Dead) By 
Lrs (1986 AIR 1218 = 1986 SCR (2) 607), while examining the 
effect of amalgamation, observed that after the amalgamation of 
two companies, the transferor-company ceases to have any identity 
and the amalgamated company acquires a new status and it was not 
possible to treat the two companies as partners or jointly liable in 
respect of their liabilities and assets. Undoubtedly, when two 
companies amalgamate and merge into one, the transferor-company 
loses its entity as it ceases to have its business.  
12. 
Learned Legal Advisor for applicant-department has failed to 
point out any illegality or legal infirmity in the order passed by 
learned 
Appellate 
Tribunal, 
which 
even 
otherwise 
is 
unexceptionable, thus, needs no interference.  
13. 
In view of the above, our answer to the purposed questions is 
in affirmative i.e. against applicant-department and in favour of 
respondent. 
 
This  Reference Application is decided against applicant-
department.  
14. 
Office shall send a copy of this judgment under seal of the 
Court to learned Appellate Tribunal as per Section 133 (5) of the 
Ordinance of 2001.
