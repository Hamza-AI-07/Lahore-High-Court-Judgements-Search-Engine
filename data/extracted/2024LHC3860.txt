Vs. 
Station House Officer and others 
JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing: 
 
 
31.1.2024 
For the Petitioner: 
Mr. Zafar Iqbal Sheikh, Advocate. 
For Respondent No.1: 
Mr. Javed Iqbal, Assistant District Public 
Prosecutor, with Khalid/SI and Iqbal/SI. 
For Respondents No.2 & 4: 
Sardar Muhammad Shahzad Khan Dhukkar, 
Advocate. 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Petitioner lives in Chak 
No.110/1L. On 21.03.2021, his 17-year-old brother, Muhammad Shafique, 
went to a nearby mosque to offer Isha prayers but did not return. Concerned, 
the Petitioner searched for Shafique but could not find him. On 12.04.2021, 
he lodged FIR No. 41/2021 under section 365 PPC at Police Station Islam 
Garh, District Rahimyar Khan, against unknown persons for abducting 
Shafique. On 14.11.2022, the Petitioner submitted a supplementary 
statement accusing Respondents No. 3 and 4 of the offence. However, the 
Investigating Officer (Respondent No. 1) found no evidence against them 
and declared them innocent. The Petitioner disagrees with this conclusion 
and asserts that Shafique remains in the custody of Muhammad Ramzan 
(Respondent No. 2) along with Respondents No. 3 and 4. Consequently, he 
has filed this petition under section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code 
1898 (Cr.P.C.) seeking Shafique’s recovery from the said Respondents. 
2. 
 
Respondent No. 1 has submitted his report, stating that despite 
extensive efforts, he could not obtain any information on Shafique’s 
whereabouts. He acknowledges that the Petitioner nominated Respondents 
No. 3 and 4 but states that he found no incriminating evidence against them 
despite a thorough investigation. Consequently, on 28.11.2022, he declared 
them innocent, a conclusion that was affirmed by the S.P. (Investigation).

Respondent No. 1 also mentions that, at one stage, the Petitioner referred 
him to his uncle, Muhammad Ismail, who expressed an apprehension that 
the abductors had taken Shafique to Sindh. He told Respondent No.1 that he 
was trying to gather more information and promised to provide updates. 
3. 
 
Respondent No. 1 has further stated in his report that on 
28.01.2024, the Petitioner submitted a written application naming Noor 
Muhammad son of Usman, and Jalu Jee son of Andra Jee as new suspects. 
Respondent No. 1 arrested them and initiated an investigation, but there is 
still no clue about Shafique. He has assured the Court of his full cooperation 
with the Petitioner and his family to locate Shafique if they can provide 
further leads.  
4. 
 
Shafique is still missing. Given that FIR No. 41/2021 remains 
active, the question arises as to whether a habeas corpus petition is 
maintainable under these circumstances. 
5. 
 
Habeas corpus is a Latin term that means ―you have the body.‖ 
Habeas corpus has its roots in the most valuable and sacred human rights, 
i.e., personal liberty and human dignity. All civilized societies have worked 
to protect a citizen’s liberty, and if the restriction on him is illegal, the courts 
should step in to free him. An English author writes: ―Of what avail are the 
rights of man if he has no means of escaping arbitrary, improper, or 
wrongful imprisonment? Habeas corpus is the means whereby the validity 
of imprisonment is tested.‖1 
6. 
 
Although its precise origins are unknown,2 the writ of  
habeas corpus is one of the oldest writs known to the common law of 
England. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the writ of  
habeas corpus was a special kind of summons used in the mesne process. It 
was merely a command by the court to bring a person before it. In most 
cases, it was aimed at persons not in custody but at large. In the early 
fourteenth century, the common law courts started using the writ of  
habeas corpus to summon individuals and to require an explanation for their 
detention. This development, marked by the appearance of the writ of 
habeas corpus cum causa, transformed the writ into a tool for examining the

legality of a person’s detention. The requirement to produce the detainee 
along with the cause of their detention allowed the courts to assert their 
jurisdiction over rival courts, such as the Chancery and Ecclesiastical courts, 
by securing the release of individuals held by these courts if their detention 
was deemed unlawful. During the fifteenth century, the writ became a 
powerful instrument in the struggle for jurisdiction between the common law 
courts and other courts. By securing the physical presence of detainees, the 
common law courts could challenge and limit the authority of rival courts. 
The writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, which emerged from this 
historical context, became the means by which individuals unlawfully 
imprisoned could seek release, turning the writ into a crucial constitutional 
safeguard against arbitrary detention by the State. The significance of the 
writ was further solidified after the Great Rebellion, where it became closely 
associated with the protection of individual liberty, often linked to the 
Magna Carta’s prohibition against imprisonment without due process. 
Although there is no direct lineage from the Magna Carta to the writ, there is 
an undeniable connection in their shared goal of protecting personal 
freedom. Over time, several legislative reforms were introduced to enhance 
the effectiveness of the writ. The Habeas Corpus Acts of 1679 and 1816 
addressed defects in the writ’s application and extended its benefits to cases 
of civil detention, allowing judges to investigate the truth of the facts 
presented in the return to the writ. These reforms perfected the writ as a 
safeguard against unlawful detention. In Thomas Pacham Dales’ case  
[1881 (6) QBD 376], it was stated: 
 
―Then comes the question upon the habeas corpus. It is a general rule, 
which has always been acted upon by the Courts of England, that if any 
person procures the imprisonment of another, he must take care to do so 
by steps, all of which are entirely regular, and that if he fails to follow 
every step in the process with extreme regularity, the court will not allow 
the imprisonment to continue.‖ 
7. 
 
The most distinguishing feature of the writ of habeas corpus is 
its peremptoriness. In Cox v. Hakes, [1890] UKLawRpAC 36; [1890] 15 
A.C. 506, Lord Halsbury, LC., said: ―The essential and leading theory of the 
whole procedure is the immediate determination of the right to the 
applicant’s freedom and his release if the detention is found to be unlawful.‖

The object of the writ is not to punish past illegality but to 
secure release from ongoing unlawful detention.3 Albeit the grounds for 
issuing it are somewhat similar, the writ of habeas corpus is not a part of the 
judicial review procedure.4 Courts have traditionally refused to entertain 
habeas corpus petitions to challenge convictions or sentences handed down 
by the Courts of Record or inferior courts, directing the party to seek the 
remedy provided by statute. 
9. 
 
In the United States, Article I, Section 9, Clause 2 of the 
Constitution, known as the Suspension Clause, states: ―The Privilege of the 
Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of 
Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.‖ According to Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist, ―the assumption has been that the limitation 
on suspension of the writ contained in Article I implies a guarantee of its 
existence. The assumption has never been tested because the very first 
Congress provided for the writ by statute.‖5 
10. 
 
The right to habeas corpus can also be implied under the 14th 
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, particularly through its Due Process 
Clause. The 14th Amendment, which was adopted in 1868, stipulates in part: 
―No state shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due 
process of law ...‖ This Due Process Clause has been interpreted by the U.S. 
Supreme Court to incorporate many of the fundamental rights guaranteed by 
the Bill of Rights. Habeas corpus is a crucial tool for contesting unlawful 
detention and is an essential part of due process rights that safeguard 
individual liberty. Therefore, while the Suspension Clause directly 
guarantees habeas corpus, the 14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause 
provides an additional layer of protection by ensuring that state actions that 
result in detention must comply with due process standards. Those detained 
have the right to challenge their detention through habeas corpus 
proceedings. Corpus Juris Secundum explains:6 ―The privilege of the writ of 
habeas corpus exists independent of the statute and flows from the

Constitution for the protection of all whose liberty may be restrained under 
unlawful authority although its functioning may be reasonably regulated by 
the legislature.7 The legislature may add to the efficacy of the writ,8 and 
reasonable regulations directly or indirectly affecting the writ and the 
procedure to be followed9 which do not substantially impair the efficacy of 
the writ, are constitutional.10 However, the legislature may not encroach on 
the constitutional power of the judiciary by limiting the constitutional 
jurisdiction of courts to issue the writ.‖11 
11. 
 
According 
to 
American 
Jurisprudence, 
the 
writ 
of  
habeas corpus in the United States is applicable in two types of situations: 
when a private entity restrains a person or when they are detained under a 
legal process. It can be issued regardless of whether the person is detained in 
connection with a civil or criminal case. Generally, some form of actual or 
physical restraint is required to justify intervention through habeas corpus. 
Any limitation that restricts a person’s freedom of movement is considered 
sufficient, even if the person is not confined in a jail or prison. However, 
habeas corpus is not meant to interrupt the orderly administration of justice 
of the criminal laws by a competent court acting within its jurisdiction.12 
12. 
 
As in the United Kingdom, habeas corpus in the United States 
is considered a writ of right, but not a writ of course. A probable cause must 
be shown. In other words, while a prisoner or detainee has the privilege to 
demand the writ as a matter of right, this does not automatically entitle them 
to the writ without first establishing a prima facie case for release. The 
power to issue a writ is not unqualified. It must be exercised with sound 
discretion.13  
13. 
 
Insofar as the Indian sub-continent is concerned, we may begin 
with the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. It codified the writ of  
habeas corpus by introducing section 491. Originally, the High Courts in the 
three Presidency towns of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay had the authority

to issue this writ but they only exercised power in respect of their  
―ordinary original civil jurisdiction‖. As a result, when the person held was 
outside the jurisdiction of such courts, section 491 was inapplicable. 
Subsequently, section 491-A was enacted, which provided that any 
Chartered High Court could exercise the powers conferred by the section, in 
the case of European British subjects, within the appellate criminal 
jurisdiction and such other territories as the Central Government may direct. 
The Criminal Procedure Amendment Act of 1923 extended section 491 to all 
the High Courts in respect of their ―appellate criminal jurisdiction.‖ 
Consequently, all the High Courts in India could exercise jurisdiction under 
section 491 Cr.P.C. in their respective territorial jurisdictions but not when 
the person was detained beyond those limits.  
14. 
 
In India, the prerogative writ of habeas corpus has been given a 
constitutional status under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution.14  
15. 
 
In Pakistan, before July 1954, the habeas corpus jurisdiction 
vested in the High Courts under section 491 Cr.P.C. Thereafter, the 
Government of India (Amendment) Act, 1954 also conferred constitutional 
power on the High Courts to issue such writ by inserting section 223-A in 
the Government of India Act, 1935. Article 170 of the 1956 Constitution, 
Article 98 of the 1962 Constitution, and now Article 199 of the 1973 
Constitution have maintained this jurisdiction.15  
16. 
 
Section 491 Cr.P.C. continues to be in effect in Pakistan 
alongside Article 199 of the Constitution. Notably, Ordinance VIII of 2002 
introduced sub-section (1A) to section 491 Cr.P.C., which allows Sessions 
Judges and Additional Sessions Judges to issue directions of the nature of a 
habeas corpus subject to the conditions specified by the High Court in a  
 
                                         
14 Article 32 of the Constitution of India grants every individual the right to move the Supreme Court for 
the enforcement of their fundamental rights. Article 226(1) states that every High Court shall have powers 
to issue orders or writs, including habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari, to 
any person or any government for the enforcement of fundamental rights and other purposes. 
15 Article 199(1)(b)(i) of the  Constitution of 1973 provides:  
(1) 
Subject to the Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate 
remedy is provided by law,— 
(b) 
on the application of any person, make an order— 
(i) 
directing that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court 
be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in 
custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner; or

general or special order published in the official Gazette.16 
17. 
 
Article 199(1)(b)(i) of the Constitution of 1973 provides that, 
subject to the Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other 
adequate remedy is provided by law, make an order directing that a person 
in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it 
so that the Court may satisfy itself that the person is not being held in 
custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner. The High Court 
can exercise this power on the application of any person. The terms  
―without lawful authority‖ and ―in an unlawful manner‖ both imply actions 
that are not legally permissible, but they differ in scope and application. 
―Without lawful authority‖ refers to actions taken by someone who lacks the 
legal right or power to act. This term suggests that there is no legal 
foundation or authorization for the action being performed. For instance, if a 
person is detained by an individual who has no legal authority to do so, that 
detention is ―without lawful authority.‖ On the other hand, ―in an unlawful 
manner‖ pertains to the method or process by which an action is carried out, 
even when there is some legal basis or authority to act. It means that while 
the person or entity may have the right to perform an action, the way it is 
executed violates legal norms or rules. For example, a police officer may 
                                         
16 Presently, section 491 Cr.P.C. reads as under: 
491. Power to issue directions of the nature of a habeas corpus.— (1) Any High Court may, 
whenever it thinks fit, direct: 
(a) 
that a person within the limits of its appellate criminal jurisdiction be brought up 
before the Court to be dealt with according to law: 
(b) 
that a person illegally or improperly detained in public or private custody within 
such limits be set at liberty; 
(c) 
that a prisoner detained in any jail situate within such limits be brought before 
Court to be there examined as a witness in any matter pending or to be inquired 
into in such Court; 
(d) 
that a prisoner detained as aforesaid be brought before a Court-martial or any 
Commissioners for trial or to be examined touching any matter pending before 
such Court-martial or Commissioners respectively. 
(e) 
that a prisoner within such limits be removed from one custody to another for 
the purposes of trial; and  
(f) 
that the body of defendant within such limits be brought in on the Sheriff’s 
return of cepi corpus to a writ of attachment. 
(1A) 
The High Court may, by general or special order published in the official 
Gazette, may direct that all or any of its powers specified in clauses (a) and (b) 
of sub-section (1) shall, subject to such conditions, if any, as may be specified in 
the order, be exercisable also by – 
(a) 
a Sessions Judge; or 
(b) 
an Additional Sessions Judge, 
within the territorial limits of a Sessions Division. 
(2) 
The High Court may, from time to time, frame rules to regulate the procedure in the cases 
under this section. 
(3) 
Nothing in this section applies to persons detained under any other law providing for 
preventive detention.

have the authority to make an arrest, but if the arrest is conducted using 
excessive force or without following due process, it is done ―in an unlawful 
manner.‖ Therefore, the key difference lies in whether there is a legal right 
to act (―without lawful authority‖) versus whether the action itself is 
conducted lawfully (―in an unlawful manner‖). 
18. 
 
Section 491(1) Cr.P.C. states that any High Court may, at its 
discretion, order that a person within its appellate criminal jurisdiction be 
brought before the Court to be dealt with according to law. It also allows the 
Court to set at liberty anyone who is illegally or improperly detained in 
public or private custody within its jurisdiction. In Fizza Mai v. Shahbaz 
Hassan Khan and others (2019 MLD 1772), it was held that the jurisdiction 
under section 491 Cr.P.C. is exercised by the court to ―restore‖ the custody 
of the detenue to the person where it rightfully and lawfully belongs. Before 
passing an order for the restoration of custody, the court must form a  
prima facie view that the custody from which the detenue is sought to be 
recovered is ―illegal and improper‖, and that there is real urgency in the 
matter. 
19. 
 
According to the Black’s Law Dictionary, the word ―illegal‖ 
means ―forbidden by law, or unlawful‖.17 On the other hand, it defines the 
term ―improper‖ as ―incorrect, unsuitable or irregular, fraudulent or 
otherwise wrongful‖.18 As per Advanced Law Lexicon, ―illegal‖ means 
―contrary to law or something that is against the law‖19 and explains that 
―improper‖ when applied to human conduct refers to ―such conduct as a man 
of ordinary and reasonable care, and prudence would not, under the 
circumstances, have been guilty of.‖20 
20. 
 
The 
terms 
―illegal‖ 
and 
―unlawful‖ 
are 
often 
used 
interchangeably, but they carry subtle distinctions, particularly in legal 
contexts. ―Illegal‖ typically refers to actions explicitly prohibited by law, 
indicating that such acts violate specific statutes or legal provisions. For 
example, theft is considered illegal because it directly contravenes criminal 
laws that define and prohibit this behaviour. In contrast, ―unlawful‖ is a

broader term that refers to actions that are not authorized or sanctioned by 
law. An act can be unlawful if it is forbidden by law, even if it doesn’t 
necessarily violate a specific statute in the same way an illegal act does. For 
instance, a contract might be deemed unlawful if it involves activities that 
are not legally permitted, although it might not be classified as illegal in a 
criminal sense. Furthermore, the distinction also suggests that ―illegal‖ 
implies a failure to comply with the technical or procedural requirements of 
the law, whereas ―unlawful‖ encompasses a broader range of actions that are 
contrary to the law, whether due to their substance or form. While ―illegal‖ 
focuses on procedural non-compliance, ―unlawful‖ suggests a violation 
beyond mere technicalities, potentially including ethical or moral 
considerations. 
21. 
 
The terms ―lawful‖ and ―legal‖ also have distinct meanings. 
―Lawful‖ generally refers to something that is authorized or permitted by 
law, with an emphasis on both ethical and legal legitimacy. On the other 
hand, ―legal‖ pertains more to the adherence to the technical forms and 
procedures of the law without necessarily implying ethical approval. 
Therefore, while an action can be legal by following the proper forms and 
procedures, it may not be lawful if it lacks ethical or substantive legitimacy. 
22. 
 
The High Court’s jurisdiction under Article 199(1)(b)(i) of the  
Constitution of 1973 is much broader than section 491 Cr.P.C.21 
In Government of West Pakistan and another v. Begum Agha Abdul 
Karim Shorish Kashmiri (PLD 1969 SC 14), Hamoodur Rahman, CJ. stated 
that the phrase ―in an unlawful manner‖ in Article 98(2)(b) of the 1962 
Constitution22 was intentionally included to reinforce the constitutional 
guarantee that every citizen has the inalienable right to be treated according 
to the law, as declared in Article 2.23 His Lordship further stated that the 
Constitution’s framers intended that a citizen’s liberty should not be 
deprived lightly. Thus, Article 98(2)(b) aimed to empower the High Courts 
to review the actions of detaining authorities without being constrained by 
the formalities or technicalities of section 491 Cr.P.C. or the traditional writ 
of habeas corpus. This review extends beyond merely assessing the validity 
                                         
21 Muhammad Ajmal Khan v. Lt.- Col. Muhammad Shafaat and others (PLD 1976 Lahore 396). 
22 It paralleled Article 199(1)(b)(i) of the  Constitution of 1973.

of the law or the actions of the officer involved, requiring the courts to 
ensure that the detention is not unlawful in any respect. However, in making 
this determination, the Court must consider the language of the relevant 
statute, the purpose behind the detention, and the circumstances under which 
it was ordered. While the Constitution grants the High Court this broad 
power, which cannot be limited by ordinary legislation, these factors help 
determine the true nature, scope, and legality of the detention. 
23. 
 
The essential requirement for issuing a writ of habeas corpus is 
that the individual for whom the writ is sought must be in some form of 
detention, whether by authorities or a private person. In other words, 
detention is the condition precedent for filing a habeas corpus petition. 
Resultantly, if the petition does not explicitly claim ―illegal detention‖, it is 
liable to be summarily dismissed. Detention does not simply refer to 
physical confinement; it includes any restriction on a person’s liberty.24 In 
Union of India v. Yumnam Anand M. alias Bocha alias Kora alias Suraj 
and another (2007) 10 SCC 190, the Supreme Court of India stated: 
―Article 21 of the Constitution having declared that no person shall be 
deprived of life and liberty except in accordance with the procedure 
established by law, a machinery was definitely needed to examine the 
question of illegal detention with utmost promptitude. The writ of habeas 
corpus is a device of this nature. Blackstone called it ―the great and 
efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement‖. The writ has been 
described as a writ of right which is grantable ex debito justitae. Though a 
writ of right, it is not a writ of course. The applicant must show a prima 
facie case of his unlawful detention. Once, however, he shows such a 
cause and the return is not good and sufficient, he is entitled to this writ as 
of right.‖25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis added) 
24. 
 
The habeas corpus jurisdiction cannot be invoked to locate a 
missing person or someone regarding whose abduction an FIR has been 
registered with the police. In Sulochana Bai vs. State of Madhya Pradesh 
and others, [2008 (2) MPHT 233], the petitioner was the daughter-in-law of 
Kanchhedi Lal, who went missing after leaving for work at Khamariya 
Factory on June 26, 2003. Despite a case being registered at Police Station 
Ranjhi and public notices in newspapers, he was not found. The petitioner 
stated that her husband, Pramod Burman, who was the son of the missing 
person, had a mental illness, and she struggled to care for him and her

children while also dealing with the authorities. She asserted that despite her 
repeated efforts and visits to the police station and factory, no progress had 
been made in locating Kanchhedi Lal. She filed a habeas corpus petition in 
the High Court of Madhya Pradesh for his recovery. She further complained 
that the investigating agency had been unresponsive and had not provided 
any updates. The High Court dismissed the petition for being not 
maintainable. The relevant excerpt is reproduced below: 
―12. 
… the writ of habeas corpus can only be issued when there is 
assertion of wrongful confinement. In the present case, what has been 
asserted in the writ petition is that her father-in-law has been missing for 
last four years and a missing report has been lodged at the police station. 
What action should have been taken by the police that cannot be the 
matter of habeas corpus because there is no allegation whatsoever that 
there has been wrongful confinement by the police or any private person. 
In the result, the writ petition is not maintainable and is accordingly 
dismissed.‖ 
25. 
 
In Selvaraj v. The State,26 the petitioner’s son went to 
Mayiladuthurai to buy vegetables and did not return. After an unsuccessful 
search, he lodged a complaint with the police, which was registered as 
Crime No. 367 of 2015. The police could not trace his son, so he filed a 
habeas corpus petition in the Madras High Court. The petition, however, did 
not allege ―illegal detention,‖ nor was there any evidence or suspicion to 
suggest such detention. The High Court ruled that this was a missing person 
case, already under police investigation, and did not qualify for a  
habeas corpus petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The 
Court emphasized that a habeas corpus petition is only competent if there is 
a clear case of illegal detention or at least a strong and credible suspicion. It 
stated: 
―20. 
The constitutional courts across the country predominantly held in 
a catena of judgments that establishing a ground of ―illegal detention‖ and 
a strong suspicion about any such ―illegal detention‖ is a condition 
precedent for moving a habeas corpus petition and the Constitutional 
Courts shall be restrained in entertaining such habeas corpus petition, 
where there is no allegation of ―illegal detention‖ or suspicion about any 
such ―illegal detention‖. Man/Women missing cases cannot be brought 
under the provision of the habeas corpus petition. Man/Women missing 
cases are to be registered under the regular provisions of the Indian Penal 
Code and the Police officials concerned are bound to investigate the same 
in the manner prescribed under the Code of Criminal Procedure Such 
cases are to be dealt as regular cases by the competent Court of Law and 
the extraordinary jurisdiction of the Constitutional Courts cannot be 
invoked for the purpose of dealing with such Man/Women Missing cases.‖

In Swapan Das v. The State of West Bengal and others,27 
 the petitioner’s thirty-four-year-old son, who worked for a company named 
A to Z for about twelve years, went missing on April 27, 2013. Following 
his disappearance, an entry was made in the general diary of Shyampukur 
police station on the same day. However, the police took no action to locate 
him. The petitioner then approached the Calcutta High Court, seeking a 
habeas corpus writ to compel the police to find, recover, and present his 
missing son. The High Court held: 
―A habeas corpus writ is to be issued only when the person concerning 
whose liberty the petition has been filed is illegally detained by a 
respondent in the petition. On the basis of a habeas corpus petition the 
power under Article 226 is not to be exercised for tracing a missing person 
engaging an investigating agency empowered to investigate a case under 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The investigation, if in progress, is 
to be overseen by the criminal court. Here the petitioner is asking this 
court to direct the police to track down his missing son.‖ 
27. 
 
Similarly, in Sudharani v. The State of Karnataka and 
others,28 the Karnataka High Court ruled that a writ of habeas corpus is not 
competent in cases of missing persons unless there is an allegation of illegal 
custody by the police or a third party. The Court emphasized that a writ of 
habeas corpus can only be issued if there is a specific claim that an 
identified individual had unlawfully detained a particular person. It also 
stated that the power under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution should not 
be used to locate missing persons, as this is the responsibility of the 
investigating agency under the Code of Criminal Procedure.  
28. 
 
In Pakistan, the Sindh High Court applied the above-mentioned 
principle in Bakaullah Khan Samoo v. Province of Sindh and others  
(PLD 2022 Sindh 308). In that case, the petitioner’s brother, Abdul Waheed 
alias Wanhial, went missing after his marriage to Respondent No.7. The 
petitioner sought help from the Additional Inspector General of Police, 
Hyderabad, to locate his missing sibling. Meanwhile, Respondent No. 7, 
denying the marriage, filed a criminal complaint under sections  
22-A and 22-B Cr.P.C., accusing Abdul Waheed of kidnapping and raping 
her and making objectionable videos. An FIR was registered at the 
concerned police station, and an investigation was initiated. Later, 
Respondent No. 10, the mother of Respondent No.7, filed another

application under the same sections, seeking an FIR against Abdul Waheed 
and his associates, claiming that they had also kidnapped her other daughter, 
Majida. An FIR was registered for this incident as well. The petitioner 
approached the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeking a 
writ of habeas corpus directing the police to recover Abdul Waheed, 
alleging that the private respondents were illegally detaining him. He also 
complained that the police had made no significant effort to trace Abdul 
Waheed. The Sindh High Court dismissed the petition as not maintainable, 
ruling that habeas corpus is limited to addressing cases of unlawful 
detention by specific individuals. It is not meant to trace missing persons 
when an investigation is underway.

The 
category 
of 
missing 
persons 
mentioned 
above  
(which I would refer to as ―untraceable persons‖ for more clarity) is distinct 
from cases of enforced disappearances, even though individuals in the latter 
category are also generally described as missing persons. Enforced 
disappearances are a serious violation of human rights, which occurs when 
individuals are secretly abducted or imprisoned by State authorities or 
groups acting on their behalf without acknowledging the detention or 
revealing the person’s fate or whereabouts. This practice is not only a grave 
infringement on the personal liberty of the victim but also a direct assault on 
the rights and freedoms that are fundamental to human dignity. The 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance (ICPPED), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly 
in 2006, defines29 enforced disappearance as ―arrest, detention, abduction or 
any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons 
or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence 
of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty 
or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, 
which place such a person outside the protection of the law.‖30 The 
Convention makes enforced disappearance a crime under international law 
and establishes the rights of victims and their families, including the right to 
                                         
29 Article 2 of the Convention. 
30 In 2011, on the directions of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Federal Government constituted the 
Commission pursuant to powers conferred under section 8 of the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act, 
1956. Clause (d) of Regulation 2 of the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances Regulations  
has defined the expression ―Enforced Disappearance/Missing person‖ as meaning such a person picked 
up/taken into custody by one of the law enforcement/intelligence agencies, working under the civilian or 
military control, in a manner which is contrary to the provision of law‖.

know the truth about the circumstances of the disappearance and the fate of 
the disappeared person. It also obligates States to prevent enforced 
disappearances, investigate allegations, prosecute those responsible, and 
provide reparations to victims and their families.  
30. 
 
The key distinction between the disappearances addressed in 
this judgment (untraceable persons) and enforced disappearances is that the 
former is carried out by any private individual or group, often for reasons 
such as ransom or personal vendetta, without involvement or backing from 
the State. In contrast, enforced disappearances are typically carried out by 
security or intelligence agencies, often under the justification that the 
individual poses a threat to national security. In President Balochistan High 
Court Bar Association v. Federation of Pakistan and others  
(2012 SCMR 1958), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held that a constitutional 
petition for enforced disappearances is maintainable. In Human Rights Case 
No. 29388-K of 2013 (PLD 2014 SC 305), the Supreme Court noted that 
Pakistan has not ratified the ICPPED. However, since Article 9 of the 
Constitution guarantees the right to life, which has received an expansive 
interpretation from the courts, and because Article 10 provides direct 
protection from enforced disappearances, the Supreme Court held that it 
could apply the principles enshrined in the 2006 Convention to ensure 
justice. In Mst. Hajra v. Province of Sindh and others (PLD 2020 Sindh 
727), the Sindh High Court found that law enforcement agencies unlawfully 
detained the petitioner’s son, Salman Khan, due to his affiliation with the 
political party Jeay Sindh and, subsequently, registered an FIR to fabricate a 
justification for his arrest. The High Court proceeded with the habeas corpus 
petition filed by Salman’s mother for his recovery, quashed the FIR, ordered 
his immediate release, and directed an inquiry into the misconduct of the 
police officers involved. The Court emphasized that fundamental rights, 
such as the right to liberty and protection from illegal detention under 
Articles 4, 9, and 14 of the Constitution, cannot be undermined by fabricated 
charges or manipulative actions by law enforcement. In Mahera Sajid v. 
Station 
House 
Officer, 
Police 
Station 
Shalimar, 
and 
others  
(2018 CLC 1858), the Islamabad High Court, while exercising jurisdiction 
under Article 199 of the Constitution, awarded compensation to the family 
of the missing person in the case of an alleged enforced disappearance.

Let’s now consider the case at hand. The Petitioner lodged FIR 
No. 41/2021 dated 12.04.2021 under section 365 PPC against unknown 
persons regarding the abduction of his brother, Muhammad Shafique. 
Respondent No. 1 investigated the matter but was unable to trace Shafique. 
On 14.11.2022, the Petitioner named Respondents No. 3 and 4 through a 
supplementary statement, but Respondent No. 1 declared them innocent due 
to lack of incriminating evidence, a conclusion supported by the S.P. 
(Investigation). On 28.11.2022, Respondent No. 1 submitted a report under 
section 173 Cr.P.C. based on these findings. 
32. 
 
Importantly, on 28.01.2024, the Petitioner submitted a written 
application to Respondent No. 1, nominating Noor Muhammad son of 
Usman, and Jalu Jee son of Andra Jee, as suspects in the case. Respondent 
No. 1 has arrested them and is investigating, but Shafique remains 
untraceable. The Petitioner has not arrayed Noor Muhammad and Jalu Jee as 
respondents in this petition.  
33. 
 
In this petition, the Petitioner has asserted that Shafique is in 
the custody of Respondents No. 2 to 4, which conflicts with his claim in the 
application dated 28.01.2024 referred to above. Considering these facts and 
circumstances, this is a case of an untraceable person. In light of the law 
discussed above, this petition is not maintainable. However, the Petitioner 
would not be precluded from availing other legal remedies. 
34. 
 
Respondent No.1 is directed to take all possible steps to trace 
Muhammad Shafique.
