The petitioner has invoked the constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court to challenge the judgment 
dated 19.05.2023 passed by the Additional District 
Judge, Lahore whereby on appeal filed by respondent 
No.3, order dated 24.06.2022 of the Special Judge 
(Rent), Lahore was set aside and eviction petition was 
accepted. 
2.      Brief facts of the case are that respondent No.3 
filed an eviction petition with the averments that the 
petitioner obtained the disputed premises from him on 
monthly rent of Rs.20,000/- vide oral agreement dated 
01.01.2015, which was to expire on 30.11.2015 but 
after the expiry of the said agreement he neither vacated 
the disputed premises nor paid the rent.  The 
petitioner/respondent appeared and filed an application 
for leave to defend the petition on the ground that 
relationship of landlord and tenant did not exist between 
him and respondent No.3/ejectment petitioner inasmuch 
as he had purchased the disputed premises from father 
of respondent No.3 vide agreement to sell dated 
26.03.2015 against the consideration of Rs.10,400,000/- 
out of which Rs.8,400,000/- was paid and possession 
was obtained.  Said application of the petitioner was 

2 
                                        W.P.No.38170 of 2023 
allowed and out of the divergent pleadings of the 
parties, issues were framed.  After recording of 
evidence of the parties, the Special Judge (Rent), 
Lahore vide order dated 24.06.2022 dismissed the 
eviction petition.  Feeling aggrieved, respondent No.3 
preferred appeal before the Additional District Judge, 
Lahore, which was allowed and petitioner was directed 
to vacate demised premises within a period of 60 days 
vide judgment impugned herein.   
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends 
that the impugned judgment suffers from misreading 
and non-reading of evidence inasmuch as it only 
discusses the evidence of RWs and states nothing about 
the evidence of AWs.  Maintains that the Appellate 
Court while passing the impugned judgment failed to 
consider that there was no written tenancy agreement 
rather oral agreement was alleged without mentioning 
its essential detail including the names of the witnesses, 
hence, the same has no sanctity in the eye of law.  In 
this regard, he has placed reliance on the case of 
Muhammad Nawaz through L.Rs. vs. Haji Muhammad 
Baran Khan through L.Rs. and others (2013 SCMR 
1300).  Further contends that respondent No.3 has not 
been able to establish the relationship of landlord and 
tenant between the parties and suit for specific 
performance of the agreement filed by the petitioner is 
also subjudice before the Civil Court, therefore, 
impugned judgment is not sustainable in law.   
 4.        
Heard. 
 5. 
 
The petitioner claims to be in possession of 
the disputed premises on the basis of an agreement to 
sell, which has been denied by respondent No.3.  
Although a suit for specific performance of the said 

3 
                                        W.P.No.38170 of 2023 
agreement has been filed by the petitioner, which is 
subjudice before the Civil Court wherein claim of the 
petitioner is yet to be proved.  However, title of 
respondent No.3 over the premises in question is not 
disputed and as the plea in rebuttal raised by the 
petitioner is yet to be established, the owner of the 
property by virtue of his title would be presumed to be 
the landlord and the person in possession of the same 
would be construed as tenant.  Moreover, the tenancy 
agreement is not necessarily required to be in writing 
rather it may be oral and implied.  Reliance in this 
regard is placed on the case of Shajar Islam vs. 
Muhammad Siddique and 2 others (PLD 2007 
Supreme Court 45).     
 6. 
Even otherwise, eviction petition was filed on 
09.03.2016 whereas suit for specific performance of 
contract was subsequently instituted on 18.03.2016.  
Section 10 of the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 
adequately deals with any agreement executed between 
the landlord and tenant after the tenancy agreement, 
which is reproduced as under: - 
 “10. Effect of other agreement.- An agreement to 
sell or any other agreement entered into between the 
landlord and the tenant, after the execution of a 
tenancy agreement, in respect of premises and for a 
matter other than a matter provided under the 
tenancy agreement, shall not affect the relationship 
of landlord and tenant unless the tenancy is revoked 
through a written agreement entered before the Rent 
Registrar in accordance with provisions of section 
5.”   
 
 The above provision of law clear indicates that any 
other agreement between the landlord and tenant does 
not affect their relationship inter se unless the tenancy 
agreement is revoked.  However, there is nothing on 
record to suggest that the oral tenancy agreement 
between the parties was revoked prior to execution of 

4 
                                        W.P.No.38170 of 2023 
agreement to sell alleged by the petitioner.  In the same 
situation the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of 
Muhammad Nisar vs. Izahar Ahmad Sheikh and others 
(PLD 2014 Supreme Court 347) has held as under: - 
 “----- when the tenant put up a plea in an ejectment 
application that he had purchased the property then 
he had to file a suit for his remedies and vacate the 
premises and thereafter if he succeeded, he would 
be entitled to take possession of the premises 
again.”    
  
 Since the suit for specific performance of agreement to 
sell filed by the petitioner is pending, he has to vacate 
the disputed premises and thereafter if he succeeds, he 
will be entitled to take possession of the same again.  
The case law relied upon by the learned counsel for the 
petitioner is quite distinguishable for two reasons, firstly 
the same pertains to a suit for specific performance of 
an agreement pending before the Civil Court whereas 
the instant matter is an eviction petition, and secondly 
as observed supra, in the absence of contrary evidence 
with regard to title of the disputed premises the owner 
of the premises is to be presumed as landlord and the 
person in its possession is supposed to be tenant.   
 7. 
In view of the foregoing reasons, the Appellate 
Court has rightly accepted the eviction petition of 
respondent No.3 and I do not find any justifiable reason 
to interfere with the same in exercise of writ 
jurisdiction.  This constitutional petition being devoid of 
any merit is dismissed in limine.
