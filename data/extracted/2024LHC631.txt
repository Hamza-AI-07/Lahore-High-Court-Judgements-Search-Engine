Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the trial court, Sana 
Ullah, the appellant, has assailed his conviction through the instant criminal 
appeal, i.e., Crl. Appeal No.78000 of 2019. The complainant, dissatisfied 
with the impugned judgment dated 18.09.2019, preferred a Criminal 
Revision No.69601 of 2019 for awarding a death sentence to respondent 
No.1/appellant. As both matters arise from the same judgment, they are 
being disposed of through a single judgment.   
3. 
 
The prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex.PA/1) lodged 
on the written application (Ex. PA) of Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the 
complainant is that he was a resident of Chak No.425/GB Tehsil Gojra. On 
17.10.2016 at about 10:00 a.m., he (PW-1)-the complainant, along with 
Amjad Ali, brother of the complainant, and cousin Asadullah Khan (PW-7), 
was present in the house of his sister-in-law Nusrat Bibi (PW-2) and his 
paternal niece Aqsa Bibi (18/19 years) was also present there. They were in 
the house when they heard the sound of motorcycle 125-CC stopping outside 
the house. The door of the house was open when two unknown persons 
armed with pistols had the following features: (1.) Medium build, fair 
complexion, young age, round face, strong body, and (2.) “Labutara 
Chahra,” young in age and strong in body, entered the house. The accused 
No.1, having medium height, fired with a pistol 30 bore, which hit below the 
left ear of Aqsa Bibi and went through and through. Then he made a second 
fire, which hit the left shoulder and went through and through. The second 
unknown accused was armed with a pistol 30 bore who said that if anyone 
came near, he would kill them. They escaped by sitting on a motorcycle 
while making threats. The complainant and witnesses could identify the 
unknown suspects when the accused would come forward. After escaping 
the accused, the witnesses took care of their niece and took her to the Civil 
Hospital, Gojra. After that, the WMO referred Aqsa Bibi to Allied Hospital 
Faisalabad due to her unsatisfactory condition. Aqsa Bibi succumbed to the 
injuries. Unknown accused, for unknown reasons, killed Aqsa Bibi. 
4. 
 
Upon receiving the information of the occurrence, Asad Abbas 
S.I/H.I.U (PW-11) reached Eye-Cum-General Hospital, Gojra, where the

complainant (PW-1) presented a written application/complaint (Ex. PA) 
before him (PW-11), who after completion of police karawai sent the same

being investigating officer, inspected the dead body of deceased through 
Uzma Naseem 1085/LC and prepared injury statement (Ex.PJ) and inquest 
report (Ex.PK) and deputed Uzma Naseem 1085/LC (PW-6) for autopsy of

towards place of occurrence, inspected the place of occurrence and took into 
possession blood stained earth from the place of occurrence through 
recovery memo (Ex.PB) and also recovered two crime empties and secured 
the same into possession through recovery memo (Ex.PC). He (PW-11)-the 
investigating officer also prepared a rough site plan of the place of 
occurrence (Ex.PN) on the pointation of PWs. After that, the investigating 
officer (PW-11) searched for the accused but in vain and then, he (PW-11)

(PW-6) produced blood stained last worn clothes of the deceased i.e. 
Qameez P-6, Shalwar P-7, Dopatta P-8, Brazier P-9 before the 
investigating officer (PW-11), who took the same into possession

documents before the investigating officer. On 18.10.2016, the 
Investigating Officer (PW-11) summoned Shahzad Ashraf draftsman (PW-

Ex.PG/1) in the scale of one inch equal to 16-feet. On 14.11.2012, the 
investigating officer (PW-11) was present at Dhama Bangal, where he (PW-
11) received spy information about the culprits, whereupon he (PW-11)

Magistrate with covered faces for sending them to judicial lockup for the 
purpose of identification parade by submitting application (Ex.PO), which 
was allowed. On 15.11.2016, the investigating officer (PW-11) submitted an 
application (Ex.PP) to the Area Magistrate, Toba Tek Singh for conducting 
and fixing the date for identification parade and the learned Area Magistrate 
fixed 18.11.2016 for identification parade. On 18.11.2016, he (PW-11)-the 
investigating officer reached District Jail Toba Tek Singh and handed over 
file to Naib Court. After completing the proceedings of identification parade, 
Naib Court handed over to him (PW-11) file of this case alongwith five 
pages of proceedings of identification parade, which he annexed with file. At 
the same time, PWs-Asad Ullah Khan, Mst. Nusrat Bibi, Amjad Ali joined 
investigation and got recorded their statements under section 161 of Cr.P.C. 
On 23.11.2016, the investigating officer (PW-11) produced application 
(Ex.PQ) for summoning of accused from District Jail Toba Tek Singh for 
investigation, which was allowed by Area Magistrate. On 24.11.2016, the 
investigating officer, got custody of Sana Ullah (the appellant) and Azhar 
Waqas (co-accused since P.O) from jail and arrested them in this case. 
During investigation on 27.11.2016 accused Sana Ullah (the appellant) made 
disclosure and got recovered weapon of offence i.e. pistol (P-1) alongwith 5-
alive bullets (P-2/1-5), which was secured into possession by the 
investigating officer (PW-11) through recovery memo (Ex.PD). The accused 
Sana Ullah (the appellant) also got recovered motorcycle 125 (P-3), which 
was secured into possession by the investigating officer (PW-11) through 
recovery memo (Ex.PE). ON 28.11.2016, the accused Sana Ullah (the 
appellant) was sent to judicial lockup.  
6. 
 
After investigation, Asad Abbas, S.I. (PW-11), prepared a 
challan and sent the same to the court of competent jurisdiction while 
placing the names of all accused persons in Column No.3 of the challan. On 
09.09.2017, the trial court formally charge-sheeted the appellant, to which 
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In support of its version, the 
prosecution produced as many as twelve (12) witnesses.

The ocular account in this case consists of the statements of 
Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Nusrat Bibi (PW-2), and Asad 
Ullah Khan (PW-7). Dr. Sobia Muneer W.M.O (PW-9) deposed that on 
17.10.2016, she conducted postmortem examination on the body of the 
deceased, Aqsa Munawar, and found the following injuries on her person: -   
INJURIES. 
1-A

After conducting the postmortem examination, the doctor 
rendered the following opinion: -

“All injuries were ante-mortem in nature caused 
by firearms and cause of death in this case was 
hemorrhage and shock due to injuries No.1-A, 1-
B, 2-A & 2-B. The probable time that elapsed 
between injuries and death was 1 to 2 hours, and 
the time that elapsed between death and 
postmortem was 06 to 10 hours.”

The statements of the remaining prosecution witnesses are formal. 
8. 
 
The learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up PWs, 
Amjad Ali and Nauman Shafqat being unnecessary and closed the 
prosecution evidence on 29.04.2019 after tendering the report of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Ex.PT and Ex.PU).   
9. 
 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the appellant was 
examined under Section 342 of Cr.P.C., wherein he refused to appear as his 
own witnesses in terms of Section 340 (2) Cr.P.C., in proof of the allegations 
leveled against him, however, tendered Ex.DA, Ex.DB, Ex.DC and Mark-A 
in his defence evidence. In response to a particular question that why this 
case was against him and why the PWs had deposed against him, the 
appellant made the following depositions: - 
“All the PWs are related inter se and they have 
deposed against me due to suspicion. In fact, the 
deceased was a woman of easy virtue and she 
was 
got 
murdered 
under 
unknown 
circumstances. Babar brother of deceased used 
to forbid her from illegal designs/immoral 
activities. Due to the aforesaid reasons Babar 
brother of the deceased left the country. I was 
best friend of Babar brother of deceased. 
Complainant party had suspicion that Babar 
brother of the deceased got the deceased killed 
through me and my co-accused. I am innocent. I 
had no reason at all to commit the occurrence. I 
am resident of district Jhang. My father Ghulam 
Shabbir was murdered prior to the present 
occurrence by Manzoor Hussain S.I. Manzoor 
Hussain S.I. had good relations with Fakhar 
Moharar of P.S. City, Gojra. The complainant 
party firstly tried their level best to trace out the 
actual culprit when remained failed, they 
involved me in the present occurrence due to my 
friendship with Babar aforesaid and on the 
instructions of Manzoor Hussain S.I. I was 
student during the days of occurrence and had 
taken examination of F.A was awaiting for my 
result. I could not even imagine to commit such 
occurrence.”

10. 
 
After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence available 
on record in the light of the arguments advanced by both sides, the trial court 
found the prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable 
doubt, which resulted in the appellant's conviction in the afore-stated terms. 
11. 
 
I have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for 
the parties and Deputy Prosecutor General and have minutely perused the 
record on the file.  
12. 
 
In the instant case, the incident took place on 17.10.2016 at 
10:00 a.m., and the same was reported at 02:20 p.m. by Muhammad Arshad 
(PW-1)-the complainant, paternal uncle of Aqsa Bibi-the deceased through 
the written application (Ex. PA) to Asad Abbas S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11) at Govt. 
Eye-Cum-General Hospital, Gojra. Asad Abbas S.I/H.I.U. (PW-11), sent the 
same through Sajjad Ahmad 242/C (not cited as a witness) to the police 
station Saddar Gojra, District Toba Tek Singh, for formal registration of 
FIR, based on which first information report (Ex.PA/1) was recorded at 
02:30 p.m. Whereas, the inter-se distance between the place of occurrence 
and the police station is 11-miles. As per the complaint (Ex. PA), contents of 
FIR (Ex.PA/1) and depositions of Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the 
complainant, Nusrat Bibi (PW-2)-eye witness, mother of the deceased, and 
Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7)-the eye witness, it reveals that two unknown 
accused persons armed with pistols had the following features: (1.) Medium 
build, fair complexion, young age, round face, strong body, and (2.) 
“Labutara Chahra”, young in age and strong in body, entered the house. The 
unknown accused No.1, having medium height, fired with his pistol 30-bore, 
which hit below the left ear of Aqsa Bibi and went through  and  through 
(ابںیئ اکن ےک ےچین اگل اور آر اپر وہ ایگ). Then, he (unknown accused No.1) made a second fire 
with his pistol, which hit the left shoulder of Aqsa Bibi and went through 
and through (ابںیئ دنکےھ رپ اگل اور آر اپر وہایگ). The second unknown accused was also 
armed with a 30-bore pistol and raised a lalkara that, if anyone came near, he 
would be killed. After escaping the unknown accused persons, the witnesses 
took care of their niece, Aqsa Bibi, and took her to the civil hospital, Gojra.

Afterward, due to unsatisfactory conditions, W.M.O. referred Aqsa Bibi to 
Allied Hospital, Faisalabad. Aqsa Bibi succumbed to the injuries in Allied 
Hospital, Faisalabad. The prosecution failed to produce evidence oral as well 
as documentary revealing the exact time of death of Aqsa Bibi, the deceased. 
Dr. Bushra Ashraf (PW-10) stated during her examination in chief that: - 
“Stated that on 17.10.2016, I was posted as 
WMO at Govt. Eye Cum General Hospital, 
Gojra and on the same day, I attended Aqsa 
(deceased in injured condition) d/o Munawar 
aged about 19 years, r/o Chak No.425/JB. She 
was produced for medical examination with the 
history of firearm injury. I attended her and 
observed her condition. ---------------------- I 
called doctor Ajmal Consultant Surgeon. He 
came and examined the patient and advised to 
refer the patient to Allied Hospital, Faisalabad. 
The ambulance was arranged and referred the 
patient to Allied Hospital, Faisalabad. OPD Slip 
No.1335 dated 17.10.2016 Exh.PM is in my 
handwriting and bears my signatures.” 
 
 
Dr. Bushra Ashraf (PW-10), who attended Aqsa Bibi (then 
injured), provided her medical treatment, arranged an ambulance, and 
referred her to Allied Hospital, Faisalabad, did not state a single word that 
who brought Aqsa Bibi, in injured condition, for medical treatment in Eye-
Cum-General Hospital, Gojra. She (PW-10) deposed in her examination-in-
chief that OPD Slip No.1335 dated 17.10.2016 (Exh. PM) is in her 
handwriting and bears her signature. On perusal of OPD Slip No.1335 dated 
17.10.2016 (Exh. PM), it reveals that only contact No.0336-3453455 is 
mentioned therein, and neither the name of the person who brought her in 
injured condition nor the time of providing treatment has been mentioned 
therein. The other document placed on the record by the prosecution is the 
death certificate dated 17.10.2016 of Aqsa Bibi (Ex. PL) issued by Allied 
Hospital, Faisalabad, revealing that “Received Expired” and in the column 
for the name of the patient, is mentioned “Aqsa, as told by Fakhar” and 
mobile number on the death certificate (Ex. PL), is mentioned as 
“03363453465”. This document is also silent about the time when Aqsa Bibi 
was brought expired in the Allied Hospital, Faisalabad, and a death 

Crl. Appeal No.78000-J  of 2019  
& Crl. Rev. No.69601 of 2019 
 
9
certificate (Ex. PL) was issued. Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant 
deposed during his examination in chief that: - 
“We attended Aqsa Bibi and shifted her to Civil 
Hospital Gojra where she was medically 
examined and referred to Allied Hospital, 
Faisalabad due to her critical condition where 
she succumbed to the injuries. We brought back 
dead body of Aqsa Bibi to Civil Hospital 
Gojra.” 
 
 
Nusrat Bibi (PW-2) deposed in similar lines during her 
examination-in-chief. Whereas, Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7) deposed during 
his examination in chief that: - 
“We attended Aqsa Bibi deceased and shifted 
her to Civil Hospital Gojra on a car. She was 
referred to the Allied Hospital Faisalabad 
where she succumbed to the injuries.” 
 
 
Contrary to the contents of complaint (Ex. PA), FIR (Ex. PA/1), 
and depositions of prosecution witnesses i.e. Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the 
complainant, Nusrat Bibi (PW-2) and Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7), Dr. Sobia 
Muneer W.M.O (PW-9) deposed in her court statement that, “According to 
police papers time of death is 10:00 a.m on 17.10.2016.” Asad Abbas S.I 
(PW-11)-the investigating officer, also deposed in his court statement that: - 
“Stated that on 17.10.2016, I was posted as 
Incharge at HIU Circle, Gojra. On the same 
day, I along with other police officials reached 
at Eye-cum-General Hospital, Gojra after 
receiving information about occurrence where 
complainant Muhammad Arshad appeared 
before me and produced an application Exh.PA. 
I incorporated my proceedings upon it and sent 
the same to P.S. Saddar, Gojra through Sajjad 
Ahmad 242/C for registration of FIR. ---------- I 
got inspected dead body of deceased through 
Uzma Naseem 1085/LC and prepared injury 
statement Exh.PJ and inquest report Exh.PK.” 
 
 
Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-the investigating officer, admitted in 
his examination-in-chief that he prepared an inquest report (Ex. PK) on 
17.10.2016 after receiving a complaint (Ex. PA) from Muhammad Arshad 

Crl. Appeal No.78000-J  of 2019  
& Crl. Rev. No.69601 of 2019 
 
10
(PW-1)-the complainant. On perusal of the inquest report (Ex. PK), it 
reveals that in column No.3, the time and date of receiving information was 
mentioned as “17.10.2016 at 10:00 a.m.”. It is the prosecution's version that 
the FIR was lodged at 2.30 p.m. If it was so, it was required to be explained 
by the investigating officer, by plausible evidence on record, as to how the 
inquest was undertaken at 10:00 a.m., a point in time when the FIR was not 
in existence. The first circumstance that raises doubt about the time of 
occurrence and death as claimed by the prosecution is that in the inquest 
report, in column No. 3 time and date of receiving information about death 
was mentioned as 10:00 a.m. by Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-the investigating 
officer, whereas, as per prosecution version Aqsa Munawar received injuries 
at 10:00 a.m. whereas incident was reported after the death of Aqsa 
Munawar at 02:20 p.m. on 17.10.2016 in Allied Hospital, Faisalabad. 
Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“The application for registration of case was 
addressed to the SHO. The application Exh.P-A 
was got prepared by me prior to arrival of the 
police. I had produced the aforesaid application 
to the SHO at Civil Hospital Gojra. The SHO 
had marked the aforesaid application to 
another police officer.” 
It creates doubt about the time of the incident and the time of death of Aqsa 
Munawar, the deceased. A man may tell a lie, but the document cannot. The 
inquest report (Ex. PK) reveals that Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-the 
investigating officer, received information about the death of Aqsa 
Munawar-the deceased, on 17.10.2016 at 10:00 a.m., which threw a cloud of 
doubt on the deposition of prosecution witnesses i.e. Muhammad Arshad 
(PW-1)-the complainant, Nusrat Bibi (PW-2) and Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7).  
13. 
 
There is another significant circumstance which goes to prove 
that the prosecution witnesses did not witness the occurrence. Dr. Sobia 
Muneer W.M.O (PW-9), who conducted a postmortem examination of Aqsa 
Munawar, the deceased, opined that the duration between the injuries and 

Crl. Appeal No.78000-J  of 2019  
& Crl. Rev. No.69601 of 2019 
 
11
death was 1 to 2 hours and between death and postmortem was 6 to 10 
hours. She (PW-9) further stated in her court statement that the dead body 
was received in the dead house at 03:00 p.m. on 17.10.2016 and complete 
documents were produced before her at 07:00 p.m. and she conducted the 
autopsy at 07:30 p.m. on 17.10.2016, which also reveals from the 
postmortem report (Ex. PI). There is no plausible explanation as to why the 
postmortem of the dead body was delayed for five (05) hours from the time 
of registration of the case and four (04) hours thirty (30) minutes from the 
time of receiving the dead body in the mortuary for post mortem 
examination at 03:00 p.m. on 17.10.2016. No doubt, delay in postmortem 
alone is not fatal to the prosecution case, but when this court considered it 
with the other evidence available on the record along with post mortem 
report (Ex. PI), they do influence the mind of the Court and leave the 
impression that there had been some wrangling about the time of registration 
of criminal case. Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant admitted 
during cross-examination that,  
“A person with the name of Fakhar is a police 
official, and he is our relative.”  
Nusrat Bibi (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I had accompanied my daughter to Allied 
Hospital and had also accompanied her dead 
body to civil hospital Gojra. I left the hospital at 
the time of autopsy of my daughter and came to 
my house.-----------I had not seen Fakhar at civil 
hospital Gojra. I had also not seen Fakhar at 
allied hospital Faisalabad. PW volunteer that 
we only the witnesses were present there.-------I 
had cell number of Fakhar because he is my 
nephew and is serving in police department. I 
do not remember his cell number. I am primary 
pass. I cannot rebut or affirm that cell number 
0336-3453465 is cell number of my nephew 
Fakhar. ---------- I do not know the aforesaid 
cell number is mentioned on the refer slip of 
civil hospital, Gojra and also on the death 
certificate by Allied Hospital, Faisalabad. ----

& Crl. Rev. No.69601 of 2019

The prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the 
complainant, Nusrat Bibi (PW-2), and Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7), 
deliberately concealed the facts during their depositions. On the death 
certificate dated 17.10.2016 issued by Allied Hospital, Faisalabad, in the 
column for the name of the patient, it was specifically mentioned “Aqsa as 
told by Fakhar” and the cell number on the death certificate (Ex. PL) was 
mentioned as “03363453465”. The same is the position on the refer slip (Ex. 
PM) issued by Eye-cum-General Hospital, wherein same cell number was 
mentioned. It reveals that Fakhar remained throughout with Aqsa Munawar, 
then injured during her treatment, but the prosecution witnesses, i.e., 
Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Nusrat Bibi (PW-2) and Asad 
Ullah Khan (PW-7), deliberately concealed these facts. In clear words, the 
prosecution witnesses have not denied that Sana Ullah (the appellant) is a 
friend of Babar, who is the brother of Aqsa Munawar, the deceased. Instead, 
the defense brought on the record that the parents of Babar deserted him 
from their house, and this fact has been admitted by Nusrat Bibi (PW-2). All 
these facts lead to the undeniable conclusion that the prosecution witnesses, 
i.e., Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Nusrat Bibi (PW-2), and 
Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7), failed to establish the incident happened similarly 
as deposed by the prosecution witnesses. 
 
 
It is also observed by Dr. Sobia Muneer W.M.O (PW-9), that 
“eyes semi opened.” In the inquest report (Ex. PK), in column No.8, it is 
mentioned: “eyes opened.” The prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad 
Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Nusrat Bibi (PW-2), and Asad Ullah Khan 
(PW-7), deposed in their court statements that they took Aqsa Munawar 
(then injured) to Allied Hospital, Faisalabad where she succumbed to the 
injuries. If they attended to the deceased and she took her last breath in the 
hospital, then there was no reason for the eyes to be open. These facts create 
doubt in the prosecution case as well as on the credibility and truthfulness of 
the statements of prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the 
complainant, Nusrat Bibi (PW-2), and Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7). This also 
creates doubt about the genuineness of the version given by prosecution 

Crl. Appeal No.78000-J  of 2019  
& Crl. Rev. No.69601 of 2019

witnesses, i.e., Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Nusrat Bibi 
(PW-2), and Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7). By now, it is well-settled law that 
medical evidence can only indicate that the deceased had lost his life due to 
specific injuries, but it does not lead to the culprits. Reliance is placed on the 
judgment of the August Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Mursal 
Kazmi alias Qamar Shah and another v.  The State” (2009 SCMR 1410), 
wherein it was held as under: - 
“As far as medical evidence is concerned, it only 
supports the prosecution case to the extent that 
the deceased lost his life due to fire-arm injury 
but it does not lead to the culprits.” 
 
 
It also reveals from the police proceedings mentioned at the 
bottom of the application for registration of case (Ex. PA) that complainant 
(PW-1) handed over the application for registration of case at Eye-cum-
General Hospital, Gojra at 02:20 p.m. on 17.10.2016 to Asad Abbas S.I. 
(PW-11)-the investigating officer and from the deposition of Asad Abbas S.I 
(PW-11)-the investigating officer, it reveals that after sending the 
application (Ex. PA) to police station through Sajjad Ahmad 242/C (not 
cited as witness) for registration of formal FIR (Ex. PA/1), he (PW-11) 
prepared the inquest report (Ex. PK). There is no reason why the police 
could not mention the names of the prosecution witnesses, i.e., Muhammad 
Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Nusrat Bibi (PW-2), and Asad Ullah Khan 
(PW-7) in the column No.4 and at the bottom of the last page of inquest 
report (Ex. PK). The inquest report (Ex. PK), if prepared actually after the 
registration of FIR and the investigating officer (PW-11) met with the 
complainant (PW-1), there is no reason why the names of the prosecution 
witnesses, i.e., Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Nusrat Bibi 
(PW-2), and Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7) are missing from the inquest report. 
The absence of those details indicates that the prosecution story was still in 
the embryo and had not been given any shape and that the FIR was then 
ante-timed.

As per the prosecution version, prosecution witnesses, i.e. 
Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Nusrat Bibi (PW-2), and Asad 
Ullah Khan (PW-7) had identified the appellant-Sana Ullah and his co-
accused Azhar Waqas (since P.O) during the identification parade held on 
18.11.2016 under the supervision of Shahid Moazam Magistrate Section-30, 
Lahore (PW-12), then posted as Judicial Magistrate, Toba Tek Singh. The 
deposition of Shahid Moazam Magistrate Section-30 (PW-12) and the 
proceedings of the test identification parade (Ex. PS) reveal that prosecution 
witnesses i.e. Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Nusrat Bibi 
(PW-2) and Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7) had identified the appellant-Sana 
Ullah and his co-accused Azhar Waqas (since P.O) together in identification 
parade jointly held. The deposition of Shahid Moazam Magistrate Section-
30 (PW-12) suggests that he held a joint test identification parade wherein 
Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, Nusrat Bibi (PW-2), and Asad 
Ullah Khan (PW-7) identified the appellant. Shahid Moazam Magistrate 
Section-30 (PW-12) deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“First of all complainant namely M. Arshad s/o 
Ihsan Ahmad caste Jatt, r/o Chak No.425/JB 
was called to identify the accused persons. The 
said witness identified accused Sana Ullah s/o 
Ghulam Shabbir at Sr. No.4 in row No.1 and 
Azhar Waqas s/o M. Riaz at Sr. No.5 in row 
No.2 one by one by placing his hand on the head 
of the present suspects. The witness described 
the role of the accused and same were written 
by me “accused Azhar Waqas was armed with 
pistol, accused Sana Ullah made firing both 
were armed.” 
Nusrat Bibi (PW-2) and Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7) also identified in the same 
manner as mentioned above. Muhammad Arshad (PW-1)-the complainant, 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“Both the accused were aged about 23/24 years. 
The accused who were seen by me at the place 
of occurrence were also aged about 23/24 
years.” 
Nusrat Bibi (PW-2) deposed during cross-examination that: - 

Crl. Appeal No.78000-J  of 2019  
& Crl. Rev. No.69601 of 2019 
 
15
“ ---- I do not know if the accused are friends of 
my son Babar. I do not know if Babar my son 
had come to Pakistan after knowing the death 
of his sister Mst. Aqsa. I do not know if he was 
abroad during the days of occurrence. I had 
deserted Babar from my house (AAQ).” 
Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“We had made statement before magistrate at 
the time of identity parade. We had not given 
the statements before the magistrate with the 
names of the accused. PW volunteered we had 
identified the accused.” 
Asad Ullah Khan (PW-7)-the eye witness, has specifically deposed that they 
had not identified the accused with their names. However, on perusal of 
identification parade proceedings (Ex.PS), it was stated by all the PWs that:- 
" اھت۔ ہکبج افرئگن انثءاہلل ےن یک یھت۔ دوونں حلسم ےھت۔
ٹ ل
"زلمم ارہظ واقص ےک اپس سپ 
Moreover, he also admitted that the accused person raised the objection 
that witnesses came to the police station and their pictures were taken; the 
witness's son/proclaim offender Baber used to meet them. The 
complainant and eyewitnesses did not rebut the objection. Moreover, 
Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-investigating officer, narrated in his examination-
in-chief that on 14.11.2016, he received spy information about the culprits 
of the occurrence and apprehended appellant Sana Ullah and Azhar 
Waqas (since P.O.)  from Adda Pull Chak No. 423/JB on the pointing of 
the informer. After that, he recorded their version and arrested them under 
section 54, Cr.P.C.; on the same day, he produced them in the court of the 
Area Magistrate. Said accused persons were sent to judicial lock-up on 
14.11.2016 for the purpose of identification parade through the 
application (Ex. PO). On 15.11.2016, Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-
investigating officer, submitted an application (Ex. PP) before Shahid 
Moazam Magistrate Section-30, Lahore (PW-12), then posted as Judicial 
Magistrate, Toba Tek Singh for conducting and fixing a date for an 
identification parade. The applications (Ex. PO and Ex. PP) reveal that the 

Crl. Appeal No.78000-J  of 2019  
& Crl. Rev. No.69601 of 2019 
 
16
investigating officer mentioned the parentage and addresses of both 
suspects. Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-investigating officer admitted during 
cross-examination that,  
“I have recorded in the file of this case the age 
of Sana Ullah accused as 18/19 years while that 
of Azhar Waqas (co-accused) 15/16 years (P.S. 
at the time of their arrest). I had annexed a 
copy of identification parade with the file of this 
case. I have gone through the objection raised 
by the accused that they were shown to the 
witnesses at the police station and their snaps 
were also prepared by the complainant party.” 
 
 
In the eventuality of the above-mentioned facts, it is crystal 
clear that the identification parade was not held by law for reasons that 
were not helpful to the prosecution. The august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan, in the case of Kamal Din alias Kamala v. The State (2018 
SCMR 577) on page 580, while enunciating the principles of law relating 
to the identification parade, has observed as under: - 
"Apart from that the test identification parade 
held in this case was a joint parade wherein two 
accused persons had been made to stand with 
dummies in two lines and their identification 
had taken place simultaneously in one go. This 
Court has also clarified in the cases of Lal 
Pasand v. The State (PLD 1981 SC 142), 
Ziaullah alias Jaji v. The State (2008 SCMR 
1210), Bacha Zab v. The State (2010 SCMR 
1189), Sahfqat Mahmud and others v. The State 
(2011 SCMR 537) and Gulfam and another v. 
The 
State 
(2017 
SCMR 
1189) 
that 
the 
identification of many accused in one go is not 
proper besides being unsafe."

As regards the recovery of the 30-bore pistol P-1 and five live 
bullets (P2/1-5), the only incriminating evidence on the disclosure and 
pointing of the appellant-Sana Ullah and positive report of Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. PT) is concerned, it is a prosecution case that 
on 17.10.2016, Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-the investigating officer, collected 
two crime empties from the place of occurrence. The same were handed over 

Crl. Appeal No.78000-J  of 2019  
& Crl. Rev. No.69601 of 2019 
 
17
to the Moharrar malkhana on the same day. Muhammad Afzal 790/MHC 
(PW-5)-Moharrar malkhana deposed during examination-in-chief that on 
20.10.2016, he handed over parcels (sealed parcels of blood-stained earth, 
crime empties, and parcels sent by WMO) to Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-
investigating officer for their onward transmission to Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore. But Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-investigating 
officer, did not state a single word that he received sealed parcels of blood-
stained earth, crime empties, and parcel sent by WMO from Muhammad 
Afzal 790/MHC (PW-5)-the Moharrar malkhana on 20.10.2016 for their 
onward transmission to Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore and 
deposited the same with Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore on the 
same day. Besides, Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-investigating officer arrested 
the appellant-Sana Ullah on 14.11.2016 under section 54 C.P.C. Asad Abbas 
S.I. (PW-11)-investigating officer deposed during examination-in-chief that:  
“On 14.11.2016 I along with other police 
officials was present at Dhama Bangal where I 
received spy information about culprits of this 
occurrence. Acting on a tip off, I along with 
police officials reached at Adda Pull Chak 
No.423/JB and apprehended accused Sana 
Ullah present in the court and Azhar Waqas 
(since P.O) on the pointation of informer. I 
recorded their versions and arrested them u/s 
54 Cr.P.C. On the same day, I produced both 
accused persons in the court of learned Area 
Magistrate with covered faces for sending them 
to judicial lock up for the purpose of 
identification parade by submitting application 
Exh.P.O which was allowed accordingly. On 
15.11.2016 I submitted an application Exh.PP to 
Shahid Moazam, learned Area Magistrate Toba 
Tek Singh for conducting and fixing date of 
identification parade. Learned Area Magistrate 
fixed date 18.11.2016 for identification parade. 
On 18.11.2016 I reached at District Jail Toba 
Tek Singh and handed over file to Naib Court. 
After 
completing 
the 
proceedings 
of 
identification parade, Naib Court handed over 
to me file of this case alongwith five pages of 
proceedings of identification parade which I 
annexed with file.”

So, the crime empties were sent to Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore, after the arrest and identification parade of the appellant-
Sana Ullah, held on 20.10.2016, but the report of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore (Exh. PT) reveals that the parcel of crime empties was 
submitted on 21.11.2016 by Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-investigating officer. 
The prosecution failed to link the parcel of crime empties submitted on 
21.11.2016 by Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-investigating officer with Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, with the parcel Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore, handed over to Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-investigating 
officer on 20.10.2016 by Muhammad Afzal 790/MHC (PW-5)-the Moharrar 
malkhana. This creates serious doubt about the safe custody of the parcel. 
The chances of tampering with the prosecution evidence cannot be ruled out 
as the case property was not deposited in the safe custody of Malkhana. It 
remained with the investigating officer (PW-11). I have noted that the 30-
bore pistol P-1 and five live bullets (P2/1-5) were recovered on 27-11-2016 
from his rented house situated at Chak No. 426 J.B. and the same were 
secured through recovery memo Ex-PD were deposited with Muhammad 
Afzal 790/MHC (PW-5)-the Moharrar malkhana of Police Station for their 
safe custody in the Malkhana on 27-11-2016. Even no evidence on record 
was available to show that the recovered 30-bore pistol P-1 and five live 
bullets (P2/1-5) on 27-11-2016 from the appellant-Sana Ullah were handed 
over to Muhammad Afzal 790/MHC (PW-5)-the Moharrar malkhana on 27-
11-2016 by Asad Abbas S.I. (PW-11)-investigating officer. There is no link 
evidence adduced in this case to find that the 30-bore pistol P-1 and five live 
bullets (P2/1-5) were handed over by the investigating officer (PW-11) for 
safe custody to Muhammad Afzal 790/MHC (PW-5)-the Moharrar malkhana 
on 27.11.2016. Muhammad Afzal 790/MHC (PW-5)- Moharrar malkhana 
deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“The parcels of 07.10.2016 were handed over to 
me by the I.O. at about 05:00/06:00 p.m. My 
statement was not recorded by the I.O. on 
17.10.2016 regarding entrustment of parcels to 
me.----------My statement was not recorded by 
the I.O. on 20.11.2016 or on 27.11.2016. My 

Crl. Appeal No.78000-J  of 2019  
& Crl. Rev. No.69601 of 2019 
 
19
statement was also not recorded by the I.O on 
05.12.2016.” 
 
 
This further creates doubt, and the prosecution story weakens. I 
am, therefore, of the view that the recovery of 30-bore pistol P-1 and five 
live bullets (P2/1-5) and the positive report of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore (Exh. PT) are of no avail to the prosecution.  
16. 
 
From the facts and circumstances narrated above, I am 
persuaded that the prosecution could not prove its case against the accused 
beyond the shadow of a doubt, as there were many dents in the prosecution 
story. The accused persons are not expected to prove their innocence to the 
hilt. If the prosecution story is doubtful, the benefit of the doubt must go to 
the accused-appellant. Against this backdrop, it can safely be held that the 
prosecution has badly failed to bring home the guilt of the 
accused/appellant, and the conviction passed by the trial court in the 
circumstances is against all canons of law recognized for the dispensation of 
criminal justice.  Per the dictates of the law, the benefit of every doubt will 
be extended in favor of the accused/appellant. The conviction and sentence 
the trial court recorded cannot be sustained.  Reliance has been placed on 
the case reported as Muhammad Akram   v.  The State (2009 SCMR 230), 
wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan had held that even a single 
circumstance creating reasonable doubts in a prudent mind about the guilt of 
the accused makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a matter of grace and 
concession, but as a matter of right.  
17. 
 
Resultantly, Criminal Appeal No.78000-J of 2019 is accepted 
in toto.  Conviction and sentence recorded by the trial court vide judgment 
dated 18.09.2019 is set aside as a consequence of which, Sana Ullah, son of 
Ghulam Shabbir-the appellant, is ordered to be acquitted of the charge in 
case FIR No.571/2016 dated 17.10.2016 registered under sections 302, 449, 
34 PPC at P.S. Saddar Gojra, District Toba Tek Singh. The appellant, Sana 
Ullah, son of Ghulam Shabbir, is in jail. He (the appellant) is directed to be 
released forthwith if not required in any other case.

18. 
 
So far as Crl.Rev.No.69601 of 2019 seeking enhancement in 
the sentence of respondent No.1 inflicted by the trial court is concerned, for 
the afore-stated reasons, the same has no weight, which is accordingly 
dismissed.
