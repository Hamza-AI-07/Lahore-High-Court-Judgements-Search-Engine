MUHAMMAD AMJAD RAFIQ, J: - Five accused persons

2. 
The appellant has questioned his conviction and sentence through 
Criminal Appeal No.223/2021, whereas, in addition to preferring P.S.L.A. 
No.19 of 2021 against acquittal of respondents namely Ahmed, Ali, Fakhar 
Imam and Muhammad Nawaz, the complainant has also filed Criminal 
Revision No.98 of 2021 for enhancement of sentence of the appellant. All 
these matters are being decided through the instant judgment.  
3. 
Facts giving rise to the present complaint are that on 09.05.2020 at 
about 05:45 a.m., complainant along with her husband Muhammad Ayub, 
maternal uncle Imam Ali, Mehtab and mother-in-law Kubra Mai were 
present in the house, where Muhammad Nawaz came and took Ayyub along 
with him on the pretext to resolve the dispute between Ayyub and Bashir. 
After a while, on hearing voice of firing from the house of Muhammad 
Nawaz, they all came to their roof top and saw the act of shooting by Bashir 
Ahamed, Ahmed, Ali, Fakhar Imam, being armed with pistols, and Nawaz 
armed with Sota was also present there. In their view, Bashir, appellant 
made a straight fire with pistol, which landed on the left of nose of Ayub, 
who fell down on the ground and succumbed to the injury at the spot.  
 
 
Motive behind the occurrence was a dispute between Ayub, 
deceased and Bashir Ahmad, appellant over reluctance on sale of plot.  
4. 
On receipt of information regarding the occurrence Muhammad 
Akram, the then SI/I.O (CW-6) reached at the place of occurrence along 
with PWs where dead body was lying in the courtyard of the house of 
accused Nawaz. He recorded statement of the complainant (Ex.PA) and sent 
the same to the police for registration of FIR. He inspected the dead body, 
prepared injury statement and inquest report. Thereafter he sent the dead 
body to District Headquarter Hospital Bahawalnagar for postmortem 
examination; collected blood stained earth from the spot, made the same into 
sealed parcel and took the same into possession vide recovery memo 
(Ex.PC). In the meanwhile, Crime Scene Unit team arrived at the spot, they 
collected and handed over to him sealed parcel said to contain pistol 9 mm 
along with magazines and other crime empties which he took into possession 
vide recovery memo (Ex.PD). He deposited the sealed parcels of crime

and Crl. Revision No.98 of 2021

weapon, empties and lead bullet recovered from the dead body to the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency. On 31.05.2020 he arrested the accused persons 
and handed over the case file to SHO for preparation of report under Section 
173 Cr.P.C.  However, as two of the accused namely Ahmad and Ali were 
declared innocent by the Investigating Officer, whereas, Fakhar and Nawaz 
were opined to be present but empty handed, therefore, the complainant 
being dissatisfied with the investigation filed a private complaint. 
5. 
On receipt of complaint and recording of cursory evidence, all five 
accused were summoned to face trial. Accused were charge sheeted and on 
their denial the prosecution produced Sajeela Zakir complainant                 
(PW-1) and Imam Ali (PW-2) who both deposed about the ocular account of 
the occurrence. Muhammad Amjad (PW-3), Muhammad Afzal 597/C (CW-
1), Muhammad Iqbal SI (CW-2), Muhammad Din Abid Civil Draftsman 
(CW-3) and Muhammad Shabbir Nasir 1173/HC (CW-4) are almost formal 
witnesses and they made statements before the Court about their respective 
functions. Muhammad Akram SI (CW-6) had investigated the case. Dr. 
Muhammad Ahmad Faraz M.O. (CW-5) had conducted postmortem 
examination of Muhammad Ayub, deceased. After close of prosecution 
evidence accused were examined under section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein the 
place of occurrence, its time and also the factum of receiving firearm injury 
by the deceased remain admitted, but with the stance that in fact the 
deceased was intoxicated, as the houses of complainant as well as 
Muhammad Nawaz  (place of occurrence) were adjoining, the deceased 
while carrying firearm entered into the house of Nawaz, fell down at the 
floor and the bullet of his own weapon hit near his nose, which resulted in 
his death, otherwise, none else from prosecution witnesses was present there. 
The motive was also specifically denied. The appellant did not opt to appear 
in the witness box under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C but opted to produce defence 
evidence. After producing attested copy of writ petition titled Fakhar 
Hussain Vs. The ASJ, Bahawalnagar etc as Ex.DF, CDR Mark-A, Mark-B 
and Mark-C and call data/location of Muhammad Akram, SI as Mark-D, the 
defence closed its evidence and the trial ended in the terms as detailed in 
opening paragraph of this judgment.

6. 
The learned counsel for the accused/appellant argued that it was an 
unseen occurrence; the deceased was drunk and had sustained firearm injury 
at his own hands; the occurrence was reported to the police by the 
accused/appellant himself and similarly the complainant was also informed 
about the incident by the accused side but after maneuvering the facts she 
became the complainant; that in any way the prosecution could not establish 
either the motive or the ocular account. The learned counsel laid much 
emphasis on medical evidence and argued that it sufficiently belies the entire 
prosecution story. Lastly argued that co-accused, including Nawaz, who 
according to the prosecution case had taken the deceased with him, have 
been acquitted by the learned trial court, as such, the entire prosecution case 
becomes extremely doubtful. 
7. 
On the other hand, the learned counsel for the complainant argued that 
complainant (PW-1) was a natural witness and her statement finds full 
corroboration from the statement of Imam Ali (PW-2) supported by 
recoveries and the medical evidence. Added that in any eventuality the dead 
body was admittedly recovered from the house of the accused party, as such, 
heavy onus was laid on the defence to clarify its position, which the defence 
failed to discharge. He lastly argued that by force of principle of abundant 
caution, the acquittal of co-accused alone would not provide a clean chit to 
the accused/appellant, particularly when his role was entirely different from 
the attributions levelled against the acquitted co-accused. 
8. 
Heard. Record perused.  
9. 
From the above narration of facts, it evinces that the prosecution had 
set a specific motive that there was some dispute of plot between Bashir 
accused/appellant and Muhammad Ayub (deceased) and both the 
prosecution witnesses namely Mst. Sajeela complainant (PW-1) and Imam 
Ali (PW-2) deposed about such motive, but neither of them could give 
details that how, where and when the earlier dispute had arisen and even no 
independent witness or document was produced with respect to existence of 
any plot or refusal of deceased for its sale to the appellant, rather during 
cross-examination Mst. Sajeela (PW-1) admitted that the land holding of 

 
Crl. Appeal No.223 of 2021, P.S.L.A. No.19 of 2021 
and Crl. Revision No.98 of 2021

family fell in her name and there was no land in the name of her husband 
Muhammad Ayyub/deceased. Though in the very next sentence the 
complainant deposed that “The disputed plot was in the name of Muhammad 
Ayyub and was not in my name”, if it was so, then the prosecution could 
have very conveniently established such fact by documentary evidence, but 
as discussed above, no such document was brought on the record. On this 
aspect it may also be relevant to refer that even Muhammad Akram Sub-
Inspector (CW-6) who had investigated the case deposed that:- 
“I did not collect any revenue record regarding ownership of disputed pot 
by Ayyub deceased. Neither the complainant nor any of the P.Ws mentioned 
regarding the description of disputed plot in their statements u/s 161 
Cr.P.C. “ 
In view of the above, I am of the considered view that prosecution has not 
been able to prove the motive against the accused/appellant and one shall not 
forget the fact that it was the only reason (dispute about property) set-forth 
by the prosecution for which purportedly Nawaz (since acquitted) took Ayub 
(deceased) with him for the purposes of effecting a compromise between 
Bashir accused/appellant and the deceased, as otherwise, it has no where 
been even alleged that both the parties, who otherwise were neighbourers, 
were carrying any other grudges for or against each other.  
10. 
There is no dispute that the dead body of Ayyub (deceased) was 
recovered from the house of Nawaz accused (since acquitted) and in normal 
circumstances it was the defence which had to clear its position. It has been 
observed that in the instant case the defence did not dispute the occurrence 
and also does not question the recovery of dead body from the place of 
occurrence which happened to be the house of the accused party but a 
different mode and the manner of the occurrence has been put-forth by the 
defence side. Even otherwise, it is well settled proposition of law that the 
prosecution is bound to prove its case against an accused person beyond 
reasonable doubt at all stages of a criminal case. Reliance is placed on the 
case reported as “Abdul Majeed v. The State” (2011 SCMR 941), wherein it 
has been held that: - 
“The basic principle of criminal law is that it is the burden of the 
prosecution to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. 

 
Crl. Appeal No.223 of 2021, P.S.L.A. No.19 of 2021 
and Crl. Revision No.98 of 2021

This burden remains throughout and does not shift to the accused, who is 
only burdened to prove a defence plea, if he takes one. The strangulation to 
death of the appellant’s wife in his house may be a circumstance to be 
taken into account along with the other prosecution evidence. However, 
this by itself would not be sufficient to establish the appellant’s guilt in the 
absence of any other evidence of the prosecution connecting him to the 
crime.” 
The judgment reported as “NASRULLAH alias NASRO Versus The STATE” 
(2017 SCMR 724), ‘NAZIR AHMAD Versus The STATE” (2018 SCMR 
787) are also to the same effect. 
11. 
As regards ocular account, in the FIR as well as in the private 
complaint the prosecution had shown presence of Mst. Sajeela complainant, 
Ayub (deceased), Mst. Kubran, Imam Ali (PW-2) and Mehtab, at the place 
of occurrence at the relevant time, but out of them only two namely Mst. 
Sajeela complainant (PW-1) and Imam Ali (PW-2) were produced in the 
dock. This court is conscious of the fact that it is not the quantity rather the 
quality which is required to establish a charge by the prosecution and 
similarly it is for the prosecution to choose as to which of the witnesses can 
be useful to it, but having said that the prosecution cannot escape its liability 
to bring home the guilt against the accused beyond any shadow of doubt. 
Here in the instant case though Mst. Sajeela complainant (PW-1) being lady, 
her presence in the house may be quite natural, nevertheless the presence of 
Imam Ali (PW-2) who though is closely related to the deceased, as her 
daughter had been married with brother of Muhammad Ayub (deceased) at 
such early hours of the day at the place of occurrence is not free from doubt. 
While observing so, I find support from the fact that said witness when 
appeared in the witness box he got recorded his address at Tehsil & District 
Bahawalnagar and during cross-examination admitted that in his CNIC his 
permanent address was written as Chak No.27/GB Tehsil Jaranwala, District 
Faisalabad. Muhammad Akram SI (CW-6) who had investigated the case 
also in clear terms admitted that around the place of occurrence there was no 
residential house of Imam Ali and also that Imam Ali PW was the resident 
of District Faisalabad.  This anomaly was sought to be clarified through the 
statement of Mst. Sajeela complainant (PW-1) who during cross-
examination came out with the stance that Imam Ali also had property at 
Bahawalnagar and thus resides in both the houses i.e. at Faisalabad and 

 
Crl. Appeal No.223 of 2021, P.S.L.A. No.19 of 2021 
and Crl. Revision No.98 of 2021

Bahawalnagar, but neither the proof of any such property of Imam Ali at 
Bahawalnagar was produced in evidence nor any such fact was disclosed by 
Imam Ali himself in his statement as PW-2. Taking stock of all these 
aspects, since no justification whatsoever has come on the record about the 
presence of Imam Ali at the place of occurrence at the relevant time, 
therefore, his presence at the house of the complainant and having seen the 
occurrence at the relevant time cannot be believed. 
12. 
So far as statement of Mst. Sajeela complainant (PW-1) is concerned, 
according to the prosecution case occurrence took place at 5.45 a.m. but the 
matter was reported to the police at 8.35 a.m. If the occurrence had really 
been witnessed by the complainant, then in the facts and circumstances of 
the case such delay in reporting the matter to the police does not sound good. 
In addition to the above, it has been consistent stance of the complainant that 
she had reported the occurrence to the police by call on 15 (Police 
emergency service) and Muhammad Akram Sub-Inspector (CW-6) also 
deposed so, but the prosecution took no pain to procure and produce 15 
emergency call record, which fact was admitted by the I.O in the following 
words: - 
“I did not mention in police proceedings endorsed on the back of Exh.PA 
that Sajeela Zakir complainant made telephonic call to me about this 
occurrence. I did not collect the record of rescue 15 to establish the fact 
that the call was made by Sajeela Zakir complainant to 15 about this 
occurrence.” 
On the contrary the defence had taken a stance that the deceased had 
sustained injury by firearm at his own hands, none from the complainant was 
present at that time and it was Bashir Ahmad accused/appellant who by call 
on 15 had informed the police when the deceased had made firing upon him, 
whereas, the complainant made call on 15 later when the police had already 
reached at the place of occurrence. The fact about making emergency call on 
15 by Bashir Ahmad accused/appellant is reflected by documents tendered 
by the defence as Mark-A and Mark-B, the details incorporated therein 
indicate that on 09.05.2020 at 6.07 a.m. Bashir Ahmad had made call on 15 
informing that somebody did aerial firing.

and Crl. Revision No.98 of 2021

13. 
In addition to the above it has been noticed that Muhammad Akram 
Sub-Inspector (CW-6) at the time of visiting the spot, secured one bandolier 
wrapped around the back of deceased which contained 60 live bullets of 9-
mm (P7/1-60), one packet of cigarettes, one handsfree set, wallet, currency 
notes, sweets soft mint, I.D card etc. The Crime Scene Unit team collected 
and handed over to him sealed parcel said to contain pistol 9 mm along with 
magazines, and crime empties. Such articles are also reflected from the 
snaps taken by the police at the crime scene, and brought by the defence on 
the record. The Investigating Officer during cross-examination admitted 
that; “It is correct that the snaps Exh.DA/1-12 were taken by the police”. He 
further admitted that pistol 9 mm (P2) lying near the dead body was used by 
Muhammad Ayyub (deceased) at the time of occurrence and he made fires 
from that pistol during this occurrence. All these items collected from near 
the dead body were sent to PFSA and report depicts LP-4 latent finger prints 
taken from the magazine were “of value” for comparison but no fingerprints 
and palm prints of deceased or the accused were sent for comparison, 
therefore, such items lost their efficacy. Similarly, according to the 
Investigating Officer on 06.06.2020 the accused/appellant Bashir Ahmad 
while in police custody got recovered pistol 30-bore P1 along with magazine 
having six live bullets P1/1-6 lying under the mattress of bed present in his 
residential room and according to PFSA report (Ex.PH) items C5 to C6 were 
identified as having been fired in the item P1 pistol, but at the same time 
four crime empties/ items C1 to C4 were identified as having been fired in 
the item P2 pistol, recovered from near the dead body, which according to 
the I.O had been used by the deceased during the same occurrence.  
14. 
Muhammad Akram SI (CW-6) who had investigated the case, during 
cross-examination deposed that version of the complainant to the extent of 
accused namely Ali and Ahmad was found to be false, whereas, the accused 
namely Nawaz and Fakhar were found by him to be present at the spot 
empty handed with no overt act. The Investigating Officer while giving 
details of his investigation deposed that: - 
“It was found during my investigation that deceased Muhammad Ayyub 
while armed pistol 9 mm and ammunition bag trespassed in the house of 
accused Nawaz.” 

 
Crl. Appeal No.223 of 2021, P.S.L.A. No.19 of 2021 
and Crl. Revision No.98 of 2021

As regards alleged recovery of pistol on the lead of Bashir Ahmad accused, 
the Investigating Officer deposed that “at the time of alleged recovery of 
pistol 30 bore the inmates of the house were present there and house was 
open and recovery was effected form the room.” Such situation causes 
serious doubt about the recovery of pistol from the appellant as being in his 
exclusive possession.  
15. 
In the light of above position, as according to the prosecution the 
firing was being made by the accused side and one fire by Bashir 
accused/appellant had hit the deceased on his nose, whereas, according to 
the defence Ayyub (deceased) sustained injury at his own hands by the 
weapon carried by him, there existed an ambiguity as to whose fire had hit 
the deceased. It has been noticed that Dr. Muhammad Ahmad Faraz (CW-5) 
at the time of postmortem examination of deceased had also detected one 
lead bullet, which along with last worn clothes of deceased, etc. was also 
delivered to the Investigating Officer in a phial, it was later sent to PFSA for 
comparison, PFSA marked such lead bullet as B3 and preferred its 
comparison with Pistol P2 of deceased; after examination reported that 
because of the lack of sufficient suitable corresponding microscopic 
marking, it was not possible to either identify or eliminate that the bullet B3 
as having been fired from the item P2 pistol. Therefore, it can be presumed 
that such bullet was of Pistol 9mm which was carried by the deceased, 
otherwise PFSA could have its comparison with Pistol 30 bore P1 allegedly 
recovered on the lead of Bashir Ahmad accused/appellant. It is another 
eliminator/factor which reduces the criminal liability of the appellant. 
16. 
It has further been noticed that doctor had also taken specimen of 
stomach and intestine from the dead body and same were sent to PFSA and 
according to PFSA report (Ex.PK), diazepam, nordiazepam, bromazepam, 
codeine, morphine, 6-aceyl morphine, pheniramine and papaverine were 
detected in the mixture of stomach and intestinal content. The existence of 
such content in the viscera speaks a long way to give a boost to the version 
put-forth by the defence that deceased entered the house of Nawaz co-
accused in an intoxicated condition.

and Crl. Revision No.98 of 2021

The above position gets strength from yet another factor i.e. in column 
“Examination of Neck”, of the post mortem examination report (Exh.CW-
5/A) between the phrase “blackening present” the word “not” was found 
written with somewhat different ink; on this aspect the doctor was cross-
examined and the relevant lines are reproduced hereunder: - 
“….it is also correct that in Mark-C in column of examination of neck in 
line No.2 blackening present is mentioned whereas according to my report 
Exh.CW-5/A blackening not present is present in the examination of neck 
column.” 
It has further been observed that when cursory statement of complainant side 
was recorded the postmortem report tendered in the proceedings also carried 
same effect like “blackening present” and later it was manipulated. That was 
the reason defence has challenged that entry for registration of FIR against 
the doctor. In support of such fact copy of writ petition pending before this 
Court was tendered in defence evidence as Ex. DF 
In the light above referred document as well as statement of the 
doctor, sufficient doubt casts about the insertion of word “not” in the 
relevant column and without there being any clarification from the 
prosecution side, it can be inferred that the word “not” was later added as an 
attempt to bring the medical evidence in line with the ocular account, as 
otherwise, according to the site plan the distance between Point No.1 (the 
presence of dead body) and Point No.3 (showing the presence of Bashir 
Ahmad accused/appellant) is 27 feet and if fire had been made from such a 
long range, there was remote chance that injury would have carried 
blackening.  
 
Further, it has been noticed that according to the prosecution case 
occurrence took place at 5.45 a.m. the matter was reported to the police at 
8.35 a.m, the dead body was received to mortuary at 4.00 p.m., police papers 
were received at 4.30 p.m. and the post mortem was conducted at 4.45 p.m. 
Such inordinate delay in receiving the dead body in the dead-house and 
conducting of autopsy about eleven hours after the occurrence is a situation 
that could safely be read against the prosecution particularly with a further 
doubt when doctor during cross-examination deposed that occurrence 
probably may have occurred within 23 hours before postmortem

examination. It raises questions about the presence of prosecution witnesses 
at the place of occurrence at the relevant time.  
17. 
Contentious standpoint of the case is the locale of injury, giving rise 
to divergent hypotheses; was it a distant fire made by the appellant or a 
close-range accidental fire emitted from the muzzle of pistol held by the 
deceased? Description of injury characterized by the doctor as having lead 
staining/ blackening not present around the entry wound of 1 CM x 1 CM on 
the left side of nostril was claimed as perfect by the prosecution due to inter 
se distance between the appellant and the deceased as 27 feet, in addition 
bullet too was found present inside the body with no exit wound, and two 
bullet casings collected from the place of firing by the appellant stood 
matched with the pistol recovered on his lead.  Defence version strongly 
confronted the prosecution stance with the touch that primarily doctor 
observed in postmortem report as ‘lead staining/blackening present’ which 
was later interpolated by inserting the word ‘not’ with different pen and ink 
to make it ‘blackening not present’; further presence of bullet inside the 
body without exit wound does not mean that it was not a close-range fire 
because the locale from where it entered was a zygomatic bone, bullet 
jacketed in the skull while touching the maxilla bone which are very hard 
bones of the body and even due to ricocheting  effect bullet usually deflect 
inside the body, therefore, no exit wound was observed, and four bullet 
casings of pistol 9 mm used by the deceased was also found matched with 
such pistol found near the dead body. Both the contentions require a 
response to many questions involved in the controversy including a term 
‘lead staining’ used by the doctor. The question whose fire actually hit the 
deceased has an overall impact on the whole case to determine the 
truthfulness of prosecution stance or otherwise, therefore, before proceeding 
further, let’s see what doctor has observed about the injury in postmortem 
report and its channel which is as under; 
A lacerated wound was present on left side of nostril of nose with inverted margin 
(Lead staining/blackening present). Direction of wound is towards Back of skull. 
(Measuring 1 CM x 1 CM) 
 
CRANIUM AND SPINAL CORD 
Scalp;            damaged 
Skull;            damaged (at the site of injury) fracture was noted

Membranes; damaged 
Brain;              damaged 
Vertebrae;       Healthy.  
Spinal cord;     Healthy. 
 
 
About Mouth, Pharynx and Esophagus, it was observed as under: - 
 
Damaged (Clotted blood present in Oral and Nasal cavity) 
 
The wound of entry was the nostril and channel begin from nasal cavity, 
entered into oral cavity and then cranium showing damage of skull, brain, 
membrane and even the scalp, which means the bullet either, after touching 
the scalp, ricocheted or it was only a reaction of kinetic energy or pressure of 
gas that causes such fracture. It is required to be assessed from the facts of 
the case and the forensic literature.  
 
If it is determined from the factual point of view as spurs out from this 
case, it is observed that the position of appellant at point No. 3 was north-
west to the deceased at a distance of 27 feet, if from such position fire is 
made it would probably hit in front of face of the deceased and in that 
eventuality, injury must have been on the front of nose and is expected to be 
exited from the back of neck or the occipital region of skull; but the doctor 
has observed the injury on the left side of nostril with skull, brain, membrane 
and scalp damaged, neither the trajectory of bullet was shown by the doctor 
nor the location was mentioned where the bullet was jacketed or recovered. 
Entry wound of bullet in nostril takes the case close to version put forth by 
the defence that deceased in an intoxicated condition was firing at the spot 
when he slipped from a raised cemented step and one fire accidently hit on 
his mouth from his own pistol. If this story is given consideration, then fire 
being made from a close range must have a size bigger than 1 CM x1 CM 
and does have an exit wound but we know that absence of an exit wound due 
to ricocheting effect of bullet is possible. if so, what factors cause deflection 
of bullet in any situation, and whether in all situations a close-range fire 
produce a large aperture or due to elasticity of a tissue it can be squeezed 
back to normal or even of lower size. All such questions are being attended 
in the light of literature available on the subject.

BLACKWELL, A john Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Publication. In CH3, 
BALLISTICS observed the size of entry and exit wounds as under:- 
“Firstly, as the bullet passes through human tissue, it imparts some or all of its 
kinetic energy to the surrounding tissue. The energy so supplied throws the tissue 
away from the bullet’s path in a radial manner leaving a temporary wound cavity 
much larger than the diameter of the bullet. The temporary nature of this cavity 
results from the natural elasticity of animal tissue (French 1962), which allows it 
to regain its original structure after the bullet has passed. There is also a 
permanent cavity which results from the destruction of tissues caused by the 
bullet itself. This permanent cavity is dependent on cross-sectional area of the 
bullet and any secondary missiles which may be produced from the break up of 
the bullet during its passage.” 
 
“This temporary cavity has a very short life span and is followed by number of 
aftershocks decreasing its severity. The final, permanent cavity may be many 
times greater than the diameter of the missile, but it is also many times smaller 
than the temporary cavity.”  
It is also in the experience of forensic experts that while entering the body, 
the bullet attempts to penetrate against the elasticity of skin. The skin is 
stretched before penetration and with resultant perforation the margins 
become inverted. Due to elasticity of skin, the entry wound gets retracted 
and the wound appears small. So, it depends on the locale of body where the 
bullet actually entered. It is only in case of contact wound when the size of 
entry wound is large. Contact wound is also known as ‘point blank shot’, it 
shows cavitation and may be of triangular, satellite, cruciate or star shaped 
due to explosive effect of gas liberated. The gas gets accumulated between 
skin and subcutaneous tissue and causes tearing of skin, thus imparting 
various shapes. In the present case, nothing like was observed by the doctor; 
therefore, it was not a contact wound, though a close-range fire due to 
blackening around the wound. Thus, it was possible that size of entry wound 
would be like 1 CM x1 CM as mentioned in the postmortem report.  
 
There was no exit wound in this case which gives rise to two 
hypotheses either it was a distant fire and locale of injury (maxilla) did not 
allow the bullet to pass on or it was a close-range fire and bullet after 
striking the hard bone deflected inside the body.  
 
The book titled “Firearms, the law and the Forensic Ballistics by T.A. 
WARLOW” Published by Taylor & Francis (Forensic Science) SERIES, 
mentions the factors which cause deflecting of bullet or incidence of 
ricochet, as under: -

“The human body is not a homogenous block of material such as that typified by 
a block of 10 percent ordnance gelatine. In reality it contains hard bones 
exhibiting curved surfaces which can deflect a bullet or cause it to break up at 
velocity levels where one would expect penetration.” 
  
“A bullet can be deflected off a rib on a person’s back so it is directed along a 
circular path in the tissue covering the rib cage leaving the victim with a relatively 
trivial injury. A bullet can be deflected or break up on striking a relatively modest 
item of screening cover interposed between the firer and the intended victim, or 
some article inside a pocket of the coat worn by the victim.”  
 
“For incidence of ricochet numerous tests have shown that firearm missiles 
striking the smooth surface of water at an angle of incidence of less than 7 result 
in ricochets; in this instance the surface of water has acted in effect as a firm 
surface. Even bullet striking surface of rougher bodies of water such as sea can 
ricochet at angles up to 20 from the nominal horizontal.”     
 
The ricochet effect is different in the cranial cavity as compared to other part 
of the body; some surprising facts based on experience of forensic experts 
cited in a book titled “GUNSHOT WOUNDS”, Practical Aspects of 
Firearms, Ballistics, and Forensic Techniques; SECOND EDITION, by 
Vincent J.M. Di Maio; published by CRC Press, Boca Raton, New York. 
Some excerpts from Chapter-9 (Bloody Bodies and Bloody Scenes) are 
given below: - 
“As a general rule, internal ricochet is more commonly associated with lead 
bullets and bullets of small caliber. Thus, ricochet within the cranial cavity occurs 
most commonly with .22 led bullets. The type of ricochet most commonly 
encountered results from a bullet that passes through the brain, strikes internal 
table of the skull on the other side, and is deflected in a cortical or subcortical 
path parallel to the internal table. This results in a shallow gutter wound track in 
the cortex of the brain. Less commonly, bullets ricochet back into the brain at an 
acute angle or along the original bullet track. The length of internal ricochet track 
may be quite long.”

“In one case, a .38 Special lead bullet entered the right frontal lobe, perforated the 
brain, exiting the left frontal lobe. The bullet then ricocheted off the bone 
travelling along the lateral aspect of left frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes; 
crossed the midline; and continued along the lateral aspect of the right cerebral 
hemisphere, coming to the rest in the lateral cortex of the right frontal pole 
adjacent to where it had entered.”   
  
Doctor has not explained where the bullet was jacketed either in the maxilla 
or in the skull vault, however, observed fracture of skull. Whether fracture of 
skull could only occur when bullet strikes that very place or any other 
circumstance can also cause such fracture; here is the explanation; 
The skull may fracture as a result of direct or indirect violence. Indirect violence 
results from (1) fall from a height on feet or buttocks (2) explosion from below 
and (3) blow on the chin when the force is transmitted from mandible to the 
skull.1 
 
Doctor has not observed any lead ring around the wound so as to make it a 
contact wound; however, observed ‘lead staining’ which shows that bullet 
was jacketed in the maxilla bone and deposits of lead inside resulted into 
staining of skin. This phenomenon has been explained as under: - 
“A bullet entered in a body may lodge in tissue. If such bullet is not 
removed, the bullet may remain in body and gets covered by encapsulation 
of tissue. Thus, it is retained bullet inside the body. Such retained bullet 
inside the body is called a souvenir bullet. Lead poisoning may occur from 
such bullet but is rare.2” 
Such staining or tattoos on the skin like marbling shows sign of poisoning; 
the above situations are explanatory to the fact that bullet emitted from the 
muzzle of pistol 9mm held by the deceased had entered through nostril, took 
a route of cranial cavity and returned to the maxilla bone due to ricocheting 
effect and struck therein, leaving signs of lead staining around the wound. 
Blackening was also present but doctor later with malafide interpolated it 
‘not present’ to make it in line with the inter se distance of appellant and 
deceased which was 27 feet. The recovery of led bullet from the body of 
deceased was also preferred to have its comparison with the pistol of 
deceased and not with that of appellant; which shows that it was a bullet of 
9mm pistol, which PFSA though had reported upon that no opinion can be

given as to whether it has been fired from pistol 9mm because of poor marks 
over it, yet can safely be presumed it was the bullet that hit from the pistol of 
deceased by his own hands. Prosecution has failed miserably to prove the 
death of deceased by the fire of the appellant.  
18. 
For what has been discussed above, in the instant case the prosecution 
has totally failed to establish the charge against the accused/appellant 
beyond any shadow of doubt and it is trite that to extend benefit of doubt to 
an accused person, it is not necessary that there should be several 
circumstances creating doubt, rather one reasonable doubt is sufficient to 
acquit an accused. Reliance is placed on the cases “BASHIR MUHAMMAD 
KHAN versus The STATE” (2022 SCMR 986) and “KHALID MEHMOOD 
alias KHALOO Versus The STATE” (2022 SCMR 1148). Consequently, 
Criminal Appeal No.223 of 2021 is allowed and the accused/appellant is 
acquitted of the charges. He shall be released forthwith if not required in any 
other case. The case property, if any, shall be disposed of in accordance with 
law and the record of the trial court be sent back immediately.  
19. 
For the above reasons, PSLA No.19 of 2021 and Criminal Revision 
No.98 of 2021 filed by the complainant fail and are therefore, dismissed.
