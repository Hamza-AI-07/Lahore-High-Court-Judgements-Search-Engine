mother of deceased was summoned as Court Witness and his 
statement was recorded as CW1. 
2. 
 The prosecution story as given in the judgment of the trial court 
dated 22.12.2017 before remand reads as under:- 
 
“Precisely, the prosecution case as disclosed from the 
statement of the complainant Mirza Shafqat Mehmood 
s/o Mirza Abdul Ghani (Exh.PH) is that marriage of 
daughter of complainant namely Mst. Zoha Kanwal was 
solemnized with Syed Ashfaq Hussain s/o Abdul Majeed 
Shah on 14.06.2013. At the time of marriage, Syed 
Ashfaq Hussain agreed to give a constructed house 
consisting of land measuring five marlas situated in 
Kotia Mughlan, gold ornaments weighing 10 tolas and 
agricultural land measuring one acre in Mauza Qamber 
Shah as dower consideration. During cohabitation, 
differences arose between the spouses on account of 
payment of dower consideration. In the meanwhile out 
of their wedlock, a daughter namely Hania Jannat aged 
about two years was born. Some days before the 
registration of case, daughter of the complainant came 
to the house of the complainant on account of 
differences with her husband due to non-payment of 
dower consideration while his son in law (accused 
Ashfaq 
Hussain) 
remained 
making 
efforts 
for 
reconciliation but Abdul Majeed Shah, father of son in 
law of the complainant was not ready on alienation of 
land in lieu of dower consideration. On 02.09.2016, 
compromise was effected before the respectables of the 
locality on the terms that Mirza Mansoor, son of the 
complainant would obtain computerized proof regarding 
the ownership of land of the son in law of the 
complainant and thereafter the son in law of the 
complainant, would alienate the land in lieu of dower 
consideration. Documentary proof of ownership was 
obtained and at about 4.00 p.m, Ashfaq Hussain 
accused, who is son-in-law of the complainant, took Mst. 
Zoha Kanwal and Hania Jannat to his house. After 
about 1 1½ hours, the complainant alongwith Mirza 
Mansoor, his son and Muhammad Akmal went to make 
program for alienation of land in lieu of dower by his son 
in law in favour of Mst. Zoha Kanwal but as soon as they 
entered the house through a small gate, they saw that 
accused Ashfaq Hussain arrned with pistol and Syed 
Abdul Majeed Shah armed with Churri were present in a 
room on western side of house and they were assaulting 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022  
Criminal Appeal No. 684-J  of 2022, 
Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,  
Criminal Revision No. 340  of 2022,

the daughter of the complainant in a brutal manner. 
Syed Ashfaq Hussain was catching hold of the daughter 
of the complainant while Abdul Majeed Shah was giving 
Churri blows on her body, as a result of which, she 
received severe injuries on her head, forehead, right 
and left sides of face, left wrist, fingers of her left hand, 
right wrist, right elbow, front and left side of neck. The 
complainant alongwith witnesses rushed towards his 
daughter but his son-in-law made fire with his pistol at 
his daughter with intention to commit her murder, which 
hit her on backside of her head and went through and 
through. She fell down on the ground. The PWs tried to 
apprehend the accused persons but they threatened 
them not to come near them while waiving the pistol and 
Churri and after taking Hania Jannat, they decamped 
from the place of occurrence while riding on motorcycle 
CD-70, which was standing outside the house. The 
complainant and the witnesses attended Mst. Zoha 
Kanwal, who had succumbed to the injuries at the spot. 
Motive behind the occurrence was that due to non-
payment of dower consideration mentioned in column 
No. 16 с the Nikahnama, the accused persons, in 
furtherance of the common, intention committed murder 
of Mst. Zoha Kanwa deceased. Upon the statement of 
the complainant, this case was registered.….” 
 
3. 
After completion of investigation, report under section                 
173 Cr.P.C. was prepared and submitted before the trial court. The 
trial court, after observing all codal formalities, as provided under the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, framed charge against the 
appellants for the offences mentioned above, to which they pleaded 
not guilty and claimed trial. 
 
4. 
In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced as many as 
12 witnesses during the trial.  Mirza Shafaqat Mehmood, complainant 
(PW6), Mirza Muhammad Mansoor (PW7) and Muhammad Akmal 
(PW8) have furnished the ocular account. Muhammad Sadiq, SI 
(PW12), being the Investigating Officer, stated about various steps 
taken by him during investigation of the case. Muhammad Zahid 
995/HC (PW1) was the witness of handing over sealed parcels 
containing crime empty of pistol .30 bore and blood stained cotton and 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022

Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,  
Criminal Revision No. 340  of 2022,

Chhurri. Kamal Ahmad 741/HC (PW2) was the witness of collecting 
call data of the appellants pertaining to mobile numbers 0334-
7552807, 0304-4486051, 0333-6451391 and 0302-7379152, whereas, 
Ghulam Qasim 1295/C (PW3) was the witness who escorted the dead 
body of Mst. Zoha Kanwal to THQ hospital Jampur for post-mortem 
examination and also witness of recovery memo Exh. PA pertaining to 
the call data of cell phones of the appellants.         
 
Medical evidence was furnished by Doctor Fatima Ali Syed 
(PW5). 
 
The remaining prosecution witnesses, more or less, are formal 
in nature.  
After recording the evidence of Zeeshan Nawaz Malik CW1, 
statements under section 342 Cr. P.C. of the appellants were recorded 
wherein they denied the allegations leveled against them and 
professed their innocence. However, they neither opted to appear as 
their own witnesses within the scope of section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor 
produced any evidence in their defence.  
The trial court vide judgment dated 22-06-2022 found the 
appellants guilty and thus, convicted and sentenced them as mentioned 
and detailed above.  
5. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellants as well as 
learned Additional Prosecutor General assisted by learned counsel for 
the complainant and also scanned the record with their assistance. We 
have reappraised the whole evidence and taken everything into our 
consideration in the light of arguments advanced by both the sides. 
6. 
Ocular account of the incident has been furnished by Mirza 
Shafqat Mehmood complainant (PW6), Mirza Muhammad Mansoor 
(PW7) and Muhammad Akmal (PW8). The above mentioned 
witnesses are real father, real brother and maternal uncle of Mst. Zoha 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022  
Criminal Appeal No. 684-J  of 2022, 
Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,

Kanwal (deceased), respectively. According to the prosecution story 
Mst. Zoha Kanwal (deceased) was annoyed with her husband Ashfaq 
Hussain appellant due to non-payment of Haq-ul-Mahar described in 
Column No. 16 of her Nikah Nama. All the PWs have stated that on 
the day of occurrence, i.e. 02.09.2016 at 04.00 p.m. Ashfaq Hussain 
appellant took Mst. Zoha Kanwal (deceased) along with his daughter 
Hania Janat to his home on the basis of compromise with the 
condition that Mirza Muhammad Mansoor (PW7) son of the 
complainant, would obtain copy of record of rights of land owned by 
Ashfaq Hussain appellant and hand over to him, thereafter appellant 
would alienate the said property to Mst. Zoha Kanwal (deceased). We 
have noted that Mirza Muhammad Mansoor (PW7) has categorically 
stated in his cross examination that his sister was not willing to go 
back without payment of dower. Relevant line of his cross 
examination reads as under for ready reference:- 
“My sister told that she was not willing to go back to 
her house until the dower is paid to her by the 
accused” 
 
Furthermore, we have also observed that Mirza Muhammad Mansoor 
(PW7) had obtained copy of record of rights (P-9) about the 
ownership of land of Ashfaq Hussain, appellant on 02.09.2016 at 
10:42 a.m., whereas, according to the prosecution story Ashfaq 
Hussain appellant was present in the house of complainant till 04.00 
p.m. on 02.09.2016, in this way, why the above mentioned document 
was not handed over to Ashfaq Hussain appellant at that time and 
there was no need to go to the house of occurrence. Similarly, when 
Mst. Zoha Kanwal (deceased) was not willing to reconcile with 
Ashfaq Hussain appellant without payment of dower then why she 
went alongwith him without transfer of property of dower in her 
name. These facts do not appeal to a prudent mind because without 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022  
Criminal Appeal No. 684-J  of 2022, 
Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,  
Criminal Revision No. 340  of 2022,

resolving the controversy she (deceased) could not be sent with 
Ashfaq Hussain appellant by her parents.  
It is evident from the record that the above mentioned 
eyewitnesses were not residing nearby the place of occurrence. 
Moreover, place of occurrence was also not the house of Ashfaq 
Hussain appellant. Although Mirza Shafaqat Mehmood complainant 
(PW6) has stated in his examination-in-chief as infra:-           
“Prior to the marriage, Ishfaq accused was settled 
at Mauza Qambar Shah. The distance between 
Kotla Mughlan and Qambar Shah is about 12 
K.M. It was settled that accused Ishfaq and my 
daughter would live in Kotla Mughlan in a 
separate house, which I had gifted to my 
daughter.” 
 
But we have observed that prosecution evidence is completely silent 
on the point whether after differences between the spouses, Ashfaq 
Hussain appellant was residing in the gifted house of his father-in-law 
situated at Kotla Mughlan. Contrary to above Mirza Shafaqat 
Mehmood complainant (PW6) has stated in his cross examination that 
they took the police to the house of accused persons at Qambar Shah 
after the occurrence at evening time. The house of accused persons in 
Mauza Qambar Shah was locked and accused persons were not 
available. This fact is sufficient to hold that Ashfaq Hussain, appellant 
was not residing in the house of occurrence situated at Kotla Mughlan.  
 
7. 
Another crippling feature of this case which cannot be lost sight 
of is that according to the prosecution story all the above mentioned 
eyewitnesses reached at the place of occurrence by chance and 
occurrence took place exactly at the time of their arrival at place of 
occurrence. This aspect of the prosecution case does not appeal to a 
prudent mind as observed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case titled as The State through Advocate General, Khyber 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022  
Criminal Appeal No. 684-J  of 2022, 
Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,  
Criminal Revision No. 340  of 2022,

Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar vs. Hassan Jalil and others (2019 SCMR 
1154). Relevant paragraph is hereby reproduced as under:- 
“Arrival of Noor Seema, PW at venue exactly at a point 
of time when the respondent allegedly did away with the 
deceased, in itself is a circumstance that reflects on the 
very genesis of the prosecution case. On an overall 
analysis of the prosecution evidence, the learned High 
Court found the prosecution case fraught from doubts, 
an analysis that cannot be viewed as unconscionable or 
imprudent, being well within the realm of possibility, 
calling for interference. Appeal is dismissed. ” 
 
 
We have also noticed that Mirza Shafqat Mehmood 
complainant (PW6) and Mirza Muhammad Mansoor (PW7) have 
admitted in their cross-examinations that many media persons 
recorded their interviews regarding the occurrence. Moreover, this 
fact has also been endorsed by Muhammad Sadiq, SI/I.O. (PW12). 
Relevant lines of his cross examination reads as under for ready 
reference:-  
“This occurrence was also reported to the electronic 
media. It is correct that interviews of the complainant 
and eyewitnesses were also aired on SAMA nad other 
T.V. Channels. ” 
 
Zeeshan Nawaz Malik, anchor person of SAMA T.V. Channel 
appeared as CW1 who categorically stated in his cross examination as 
under:- 
“I had conducted the interviews. I don't remember 
that interviews of father, mother and brother of 
deceased were conducted exactly at the spot but 
the possibility of the same cannot be ruled out. 
Confronted with the CD Exh.DA (portion of the 
video showing the place of occurrence of the 
instant case), I say, it is the same place whereby 
the alleged occurrence took place. It is correct that 
in CD Exh.DA the portion regarding the statement 
of father of deceased namely Shafqat Mahmood is 
same as shown in the video that when he 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022  
Criminal Appeal No. 684-J  of 2022, 
Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,  
Criminal Revision No. 340  of 2022,   
9
(complainant) reached at the place of occurrence, 
deceased Zoha Kanwal was lying dead in her 
room. Confronted with the CD Exh.DA (portion of 
the video showing the statement of the mother of 
the deceased), it is correct that in CD Exh.DA the 
portion regarding the statement of mother of 
deceased namely Shakeela Baigm is same as 
shown in the video that when she reached at the 
place of occurrence, deceased Zoha Kanwal was 
lying dead in her room. At the time of interview, 
the son of complainant namely Mansoor was also 
present there. The said Mansoor has also endorsed 
the statement of his parents.  
 
 
In the light of above facts, it is abundantly clear that the 
eyewitnesses reached at the place of occurrence afterwards and we are 
quite confident to hold that supra mentioned witnesses are related and 
chance witnesses. A chance witness in legal parlance is the one who 
claims that he was present on the crime spot at the fateful time, albeit, 
his presence there was a sheer chance as in the ordinary course of 
business, place of residence and normal course of events, he was not 
supposed to be present at the spot but at a place where he resides, 
carries on business or runs day-to-day life affairs, in this context the 
testimony of chance witness, ordinarily, is not accepted unless 
justifiable reasons are shown to establish his presence at the crime 
scene at the relevant time. In normal course, presumption under the 
law would operate about his absence from the crime spot. True that in 
rare cases, the testimony of chance witness may be relied upon, 
provided some convincing explanations appealing to prudent mind for 
his presence on the crime spot are put forth, his testimony would fall 
within the category of suspect evidence and cannot be accepted 
without a pinch of salt. Guidance can be sought from the case laws 
titled as “Mst. Mir Zalai v. Ghazi Khan and others” (2020 SCMR 
319), “Ibrar Hussain and another v. The State” (2020 SCMR 1850) 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022  
Criminal Appeal No. 684-J  of 2022, 
Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,  
Criminal Revision No. 340  of 2022,   
10
“Liaqat Ali and another v. The State and others” (2021 SCMR 780) 
and “Abdul Khaliq v. The State” (2021 SCMR 325).    
8. 
According to the Inquest Report (Exh. PF) and post mortem 
report of Mst. Zoha Kanwal (deceased) (Exh. PE) as well as statement 
of Dr. Fatima Ali Syed, WMO (PW5) mouth of Mst. Zoha Kanwal 
(deceased) was opened. This fact shows that no person had afflicted to 
close the mouth of Mst. Zoha Kanwal (deceased), which couldn't have 
befell in the presence of eye witnesses. Reliance is placed upon the 
cases titled as “Muhammad Asif vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 486), 
“Zahir Yousaf and another v. The State and another” (2017 SCMR 
2002) and “Muhammad Rafique alias Feeqa v. The State” (2019 
SCMR 1068). 
 
9. 
Another important fact of this case is that the alleged 
eyewitnesses namely Mirza Shafaqat Mehmood complainant (PW6), 
Mirza Muhammad Mansoor (PW7) and Muhammad Akmal (PW8) 
are not the witnesses of identification of deadbody of deceased at the 
time of autopsy of Mst. Zoha Kanwal (deceased). Furthermore, they 
are also not the witnesses of identification of deadbody at the time of 
preparing the inquest report (Exh. PF). Had they been present at the 
scene of the occurrence at the relevant time, they must have been the 
witnesses of identification of deadbody. This fact has constrained us 
to hold that they were not present at the time and place of occurrence. 
A reference in this respect may be made to the cases reported as 
“Abdul Jabbar alias Jabri v. The State” (2017 SCMR 1155), 
“Nadeem alias Kala v. The State and others” (2018 SCMR 153) and 
“Liaqat Ali and another v. The State and others” (2021 SCMR 780). 
 
10. 
The record further reflects that according to the statement of Dr. 
Fatima Ali Syed, WMO (PW5) Mst. Zoha Kanwal (deceased) 
received one fire shot and sixteen other injuries on the body of Mst. 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022  
Criminal Appeal No. 684-J  of 2022, 
Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,  
Criminal Revision No. 340  of 2022,   
11
Zoha Kanwal (deceased) at the time of conducting post mortem 
examination on her body, whereas, according to the statement of 
Mirza Shafqat Mehmood complainant (PW6) their clothes were not 
stained with blood at the time of attending the deceased. Relevant line 
of his cross-examination is hereby described as under:- 
“Neither my clothes nor the clothes of the witnesses 
became stained with blood while attending my 
deceased daughter.”  
 
 
 
We are of the view that it is improbable when a person has 
sustained 17 injuries with fire shot and sharp-edged weapon, blood 
would not ooze and would not touch the clothes of attending persons. 
This fact constrained us to hold that eyewitnesses were not present at 
the time and place of occurrence, otherwise, their clothes must have 
been stained with blood while attending the deceased, hence, both the 
witnesses of ocular account were not reliable and there is likelihood 
that they had not witnessed the occurrence.  
 
11. 
Another important fact of this case is that Abdul Majeed Shah 
appellant was declared innocent during the course of investigation. 
Muhammad Sadiq, SI/I.O. (PW12) has stated in his cross-examination 
as infra:-  
“On 16.09.2016, I joined accused Abdul Majeed into 
investigation and recorded his first version. Accused 
Abdul Majeed took the plea before me that he had 
no concern with the alleged occurrence and he was 
innocent. It is correct that he also took plea that his 
backbone was operated upon and his knee and arm 
were fractured. It is correct that he also took the plea 
that he offered Jumma and Asar prayers in Shrine 
of Ali Shah and he could produce the persons who 
were present there. I joined 16 respectables of the 
area in the investigation and they verified the plea of 
accused Abdul Majeed, therefore, I declared that 
accused Abdul Majeed was not involved in the 
occurrence and had no nexus with the present 
occurrence.”

Although it is generally established principle of law that ipse dixit of 
the police is not binding on the Court, yet it can be considered if it is 
founded on some cogent and convincing evidence. A reference in this 
respect may be made to the case tilted as “Khalid Mehmood and 
others vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 664) wherein it has been held 
infra:-  
 Adverting to the case of Abid Hussain appellant, it may 
be observed that no weapon of offence has been effected 
from his possession. He was found innocent by different 
police agencies including Ch. Akhtar Hussain, DSP, 
CIA, Sheikhupura and got discharged from the Court of 
the Magistrate, which order was not challenged by the 
complainant. We entertain serious doubt in our minds, 
regarding participation of appellant Abid Hussain in 
the commission of crime. The evidence of the 
complainant and Nasir Ahmad P.Ws. qua appellant 
Abid Hussain is not credible and trustworthy.” 
Similar view has also been taken in the recent case reported as 
Sajjad Hussain vs. The State and others (2022 SCMR 1540).  
 
12. 
Insofar as the evidence of call data record of the appellants is 
concerned, it is noteworthy that no voice record transcript has been 
brought on record. The evidence further demonstrates that both the 
appellants were in telephonically contact and not more than this. Here, 
we would like to refer to the case of “Azeem Khan and others vs. 
Mujahid Khan and others” (2016 SCMR 274) wherein it has been 
held as under:- 
“The cell phone call data  collected is of no  help to  
the prosecution for the reasons that numerous 
calls have been made indicating continuous 
interaction between the two cell phones, contrary 
to the evidence given by Muhammad Wali (PW-3), 
who has stated at the trial that the unknown caller 
made calls on his cell phone four times. No 
competent witness was produced at the  trial,  who  
provided  the  call  data,  Ex.P -1  to  Ex.P-5.  No  
voice  record  transcript  has  been brought on 
record. Similarly from which area the caller made 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022

Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,  
Criminal Revision No. 340  of 2022,   
13
the calls, is also not shown in it. Above all, the 
most crucial and conclusive proof that the cell 
phone was owned by the accused and  SIM  
allotted  was  in  his  name  is  also  missing.  In  
this  view  of  the  matter,  this  piece  of evidence  
is  absolutely  inconclusive  and  of  no  benefit  to  
the  prosecution  nor  it  connects  the accused with 
the crime in any manner.”  
 
13. 
Insofar as motorcycle CD-70 recovered on the pointation of 
Ashfaq Hussain appellant from the house of Abdul Majeed Shah 
appellant situated in Mauza Qamber Shah, which was taken into 
possession by the Investigating Officer vide seizure memo (Ex.PM) is 
concerned, no registration number, colour, has been described in the 
FIR. In this way, recovery of motorcycle at the pointation of the 
appellants is inconsequential and not helpful to the prosecution case. 
We fortify our view from the dictum laid down in the case titled as 
“Naveed Asghar Vs. The State and another” (PLD 2021 SC 600).  
 
 
Now adverting to recoveries of pistol 30 bore P-12 taken into 
possession vide seizure memo Exh. PN at the pointation of Ashfaq 
Hussain appellant from deserted building of irrigation department and 
recovery of blood stained Chhurri P-14 taken into possession vide 
seizure memo Exh. PO at the pointation of appellant from the place of 
occurrence are concerned, we have noted that place of recovery of 
pistol 30 bore P-12 was an open place and accessible to everyone, in 
this way, the recovery of pistol P-12 is inconsequential in the eye of 
law. In this backdrop, the supra mentioned recovery has no evidentiary 
worth. Reference in this context may be made to the case of 
“Muhammad Ismail and others vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 898). 
 
 
As regards recovery of Chhurri P-14 is concerned, we have 
observed that according to the prosecution story the same was not used 
by Ashfaq Hussain appellant rather Abdul Majeed Shah co-convict has 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022  
Criminal Appeal No. 684-J  of 2022, 
Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,  
Criminal Revision No. 340  of 2022,   
14
used the same who was declared innocent during the course of 
investigation. More so, report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore qua pistol and Chhurri Exh. PT as well as Exh. PU are not 
helpful to the prosecution case because we have already disbelieved 
the recovery of pistol P-12 at the pointation of Ashfaq Hussain 
appellant, whereas, positive report of PFSA Exh. PT qua the human 
blood on Chhurri P-12 has also no legal credence because occurrence 
in this case allegedly took place on 02.09.2016 and Chhurri P-14 was 
deposited in the Office of PFSA, Lahore on 04.10.2016, i.e. with the 
delay of 30 days. It is settled proposition of law that blood disintegrate 
after three weeks. We fortify our view from the case titled as 
“Muhammad Jamil v. Muhammad Akram and others” (2009 SCMR 
120) and “Faisal Mehmood v. The State” (2016 SCMR 2138).   
 
We have also taken note that witnesses of above mentioned 
recoveries are Mirza Muhammad Mansoor (PW7) and Muhammad 
Akmal (PW8) who are also witnesses of ocular account and their 
evidence has been disbelieved by us in the preceding paragraphs No. 6 
and 7 of this judgment, in this way, their evidence to the extent of 
corroborative piece of evidence is also not helpful to the prosecution 
case. Wisdom can also be derived from the case law titled as Mst. 
Rukhsana Begum and others vs. Sajjad and others (2017 SCMR 596) 
wherein it was held as under:-  
 
“It is also pertinent to mention here, that the attesting 
witness to  all  these recoveries of incriminating  articles  
is  Muhammad  Sharif  (PW-9)  whose  testimony  we  
have  already disbelieved as a whole. It is fundamental 
principle of justice that corroboratory evidence, must 
come from independent source providing strength  and 
endorsement  to the account of the eyewitnesses, 
therefore, eye-witnesses, in the absence of extraordinary 
and very exceptional and rare circumstances,  cannot  
corroborate  themselves  by  becoming  attesting  
witness/witnesses  to  the recovery  of  crime  articles.  
In  other  words,  eye-witnesses  cannot  corroborate  

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022  
Criminal Appeal No. 684-J  of 2022, 
Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,  
Criminal Revision No. 340  of 2022,   
15
themselves  but corroboratory  evidence  must  come  
from  independent  source  and  shall  be  supported  by 
independent witnesses other than eye-witnesses, thus, 
these recoveries are equally of no judicial efficacy.” 
 
14. 
Now the next piece of evidence which still remains in the field 
is the motive advanced by the prosecution behind the unfortunate 
incident, which, as per, Mirza Shafqat Mehmood complainant (PW6) 
and Mirza Muhammad Mansoor (PW7) was that there was dispute 
between deceased Mst. Zoha Kanwal and accused persons on account 
of non-payment of dower mentioned in Nikah Nama and under the 
said grudge the appellants in furtherance of their common intention 
committed the occurrence. We have noted that motive was only an 
oral assertion of the complainant and no material evidence was 
produced to substantiate the motive alleged by the prosecution, hence, 
we feel no hesitation to hold that the prosecution has failed to prove 
the motive part of the unfortunate occurrence. Although, the 
prosecution is not under obligation to establish a motive in every 
murder case but it is also well settled principle of criminal 
jurisprudence that if prosecution sets up a motive but fails to prove it, 
then, it is the prosecution who has to suffer and not the accused. 
Guidance is hereby sought from the case laws  reported as“ “Manzoor 
Ahmed Shah and others Vs. The State and others” (2019 SCMR 
2000), “Muhammad Ilyas and another Vs. Ameer Ali and another” 
(2020 SCMR 305), “Liaqat Ali and another Vs. The State and others” 
(2021 SCMR 780) and “Khalid Mehmood and other Vs. The State and 
others” (2021 SCMR 810). 
 
15.  
We have considered all the pros and cons of this case and 
have come to an irresistible conclusion that the prosecution could 
not prove its case against the appellants beyond the shadow of 
doubt. It is, by now well established that it is the prosecution, which 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022  
Criminal Appeal No. 684-J  of 2022, 
Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,  
Criminal Revision No. 340  of 2022,   
16
has to prove its case against the accused by standing on its own 
legs, but in this case the prosecution remained failed to discharge its 
responsibility. It is also well settled by now that if there is a single 
circumstance which creates doubt regarding the prosecution case, 
the same is sufficient to give benefit of doubt to the accused, 
whereas, the instant case is replete with number of circumstances 
which have created serious doubt about the prosecution story. In 
case of "Naveed Asghar and two others Vs. The State" (PLD 2021 
SC 600), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, in paragraph 
No.33, was pleased to observe as under-- 
"....The prosecution is under obligation to prove its 
case against the accused person at the standard of 
proof required in criminal cases, namely, beyond 
reasonable doubt standard, and cannot be said to have 
discharged this obligation by producing evidence that 
merely meets the preponderance of probability 
standard applied in civil cases. If the prosecution fails 
to discharge its said obligation and there remains a 
reasonable doubt, not an imaginary or artificial doubt, 
as to the guilt of the accused person, the benefit of that 
doubt is to be given to the accused person as of right, 
not as of concession. The rule of giving benefit of doubt 
to accused person is essentially a rule of caution and 
prudence, and is deep rooted in our jurisprudence  for 
safe administration of criminal justice. In common law, 
it is based on the maxim, “It is better that ten guilty 
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person 
be convicted”. While in Islamic criminal law it is based 
on the high authority of sayings of the Holy Prophet of 
Islam (peace be upon him): “Avert punishments 
[hudood] when there are doubts”; and” Drive off the 
ordained crimes from the Muslims as far as you can. If 
there is any place of refuge for him [accused], let him 
have his way, because the leader’s mistake in pardon is 
better than his mistake in punishment”. A three-
member Bench of this Court has quoted probably latter 
part of the last mentioned saying of the Holy Prophet 
(peace be upon him) in Ayub Masih v. State in the 
English translation thus: “Mistake of Qazi (Judge)  in 

Murder Reference No.51 of 2022  
Criminal Appeal No. 684-J  of 2022, 
Criminal Appeal No. 683  of 2022 and,  
Criminal Revision No. 340  of 2022,   
17
releasing a criminal is better than his mistake in 
punishing an innocent.” 
 
 Similar view was taken in the cases of “Muhammad Imran Vs. 
The State” (2020 SCMR 857), “Mst. Hajira Bibi alias Seema and 
others vs. Abdul Qaseem and another” (2023 SCMR 870).    
 
16. 
For the foregoing reasons, the above mentioned appeals filed 
by Ashfaq Hussain and Abdul Majeed Shah appellants are 
accepted, convictions and sentences awarded to them vide 
judgment dated 22-06-2022  passed by the trial court are set aside 
and they are acquitted of the charge leveled against them while 
extending the benefit of doubt in their favour. They shall be 
released forthwith if not required to be detained in any other case. 
17. 
Murder Reference No.51 of 2022 is answered in negative and 
death sentence passed by trial court against Ashfaq Hussain, appellant 
is not confirmed.   
 
18. 
As a natural corollary, criminal revision filed by Shafqat 
Mehmood, complainant for the conversion of sentence of life 
imprisonment of Abdul Majeed Shah into sentence of death is 
dismissed.
