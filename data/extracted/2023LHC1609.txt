Through this constitutional petition, the 
petitioner has called in question the action of the 
respondents, whereby despite being at Serial No. 1 of 
the merit list on the basis of written exam, the 
petitioner has not been selected for appointment 
against the post of Constable.  
2.   
 The claim of the learned counsel for the 
petitioner is that the petitioner could not be refused 
appointment as he was at Serial No. 1 of the merit list 
and the action of the respondents for not selecting the 
petitioner is mala fide, which action is liable to be 
set-aside and for this purpose relies upon judgment 
reported as NLR 1997 Service 29 (AMJAD LATIF 
versus C.B.R) to state that merit list prepared on the 
basis of written test for appointment to civil posts 
cannot be upset through apportionment of marks 
reserved for viva voce when methodology of 
apportionment of marks reserved for viva voce is 
adopted by selection committee in a mala fide 
manner. Besides, it is stated the claim of the 
respondents that the petitioner was found involved in 
a criminal case was also not justified.

3.    
The learned Additional Advocate General 
under instructions states that despite being at Serial 
No. 1 of the merit list after written examination, the 
petitioner had failed to qualify in interview, where he 
was required to obtain at least 8 out of 20 marks but 
he only secured 7 marks, therefore, he failed to meet 
with the threshold for appointment to the post of 
Constable advertised by the respondents for District 
T.T. Singh. Besides it is claimed that petitioner had 
not disclosed the factum of registration of criminal 
case against him in his application form despite being 
required to do so, hence he cannot seek appointment.  
4.   
There are two questions involved in the 
matter: first, is that the petitioner has failed in 
interview; and second, that he was involved in a 
criminal case. 
5.  
As regards the question of failure in 
interview on account of obtaining less marks than 
required, this court may refer to some cases earlier 
decided by courts of law. The Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in judgment reported as 2014 
SCMR 157 (Muhammad Ashraf Sangri v. Federation of 
Pakistan and others) while considering the cases of 
employees, who had not been selected on the basis of 
interview has observed that High Court cannot 
interfere in marks awarded by the Interview Board 
unless mala fide or bias or for that matter patent error 
is floating on the surface of the record because an 
interview is a subjective matter relating to fitness of 
any candidate for a particular post and could at best 
be assessed by functionaries, who were entrusted 
with such responsibility.  
6.    
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
case reported as 2015 SCMR 112 (Arshad Tabassum 
Vs. The Registrar, Lahore High Court, Lahore) has 

 
W.P. No. 78710 of 2022 
3 
 
declared that court cannot substitute opinion of the 
interview committee on a bald allegation made by an 
unsuccessful candidate, who lost chance in the 
interview. The operative part of the said judgment is 
reproduced below: 
 
“6.         We have heard the petitioner in person as 
well as learned Additional Advocate-General, Punjab 
and have perused the available record. It is an 
admitted fact that the Interviewing Committee laid 
down a criteria for filling in the post of Additional 
District and Sessions Judge as under: - 
 
            "17. Interview of 100 marks of 
successful candidates will be conducted by the 
Examination 
Committee. 
The 
Candidates 
securing 50% marks in interview and falling in 
merit will be considered for recommendation 
of their appointment as Additional District and 
Sessions Judge." 
 
 
            Out of 904 candidates, who appeared in the 
written examination, 53 candidates were declared 
pass therein. The aforesaid 53 candidates were called 
for interview as per aforementioned criteria laid 
down by the Examination Committee out of whom 
only 31 candidates could pass the interview and they 
were appointed as Additional District and Sessions 
Judges vide Notification dated 3-6-2013. The 
petitioner failed to obtain requisite marks in the 
interview for having him declared pass, as such, was 
not recommended for appointment as he obtained 40 
marks in interview out of 100 marks whereas 
according to the afore quoted criteria, a candidate 
can only be eligible for appointment if he obtains 50% 
marks in the interview but the petitioner could not 
obtain the marks according to the criteria. 
7.         As far as the contention of the petitioner that 
he was not recommended for appointment by the 
committee due to the malice on the part of the 
members of the Interview Committee for the reason 
that his services were terminated as Civil Judge on 
the charge of misconduct, is concerned, suffice it to 
observe that according to the established principle of 
law this Court cannot substitute opinion of the 
Interview Committee on the bald allegation after 
losing the chance in the interview. Reference is made 
to the case of Asif Mahmood Chughtai, Advocate and 
17 others v. Government of Punjab through Chief 
Secretary and others (2000 SCMR 966), Dr. Mir 
Alam Jan v. Dr. Muhammad Shahzad and others 
(2008 SCMR 960) and Muhammad Ashraf Sangri v. 
Federation of Pakistan and others (2014 SCMR 157). 
In such circumstances, the petitioner could not 
establish any malice on the part of the Interview

Committee. There is also no measuring apparatus 
with this Court to determine that the petitioner was 
deferred in the interview by the Interview Committee 
only for the sole reason of his misconduct as Civil 
Judge. It is presumed that the Interview Committee 
must have given the petitioner marks after judging his 
ability without being influenced by the earlier 
misconduct of the petitioner as the Interview 
Committee was not acting as Disciplinary Committee 
dealing with the misconduct of the petitioner. Since 
the petitioner could not fulfil the requisite criteria for 
the post of Additional District and Sessions Judge, 
therefore, he was not recommended for appointment 
by the Selection Committee, thus, no illegality has 
been committed by the respondent while acting on the 
recommendations of the Examination Committee 
warranting interference by this Court in its 
constitutional jurisdiction. 
8.         Upshot of the above discussion is that we find 
no merit in this petition which is hereby dismissed.” 
 
7.    
The petitioner claims that he has not been 
appointed as he was found involved in a criminal 
case but he has failed to point out any mala fide on 
behalf of the respondents to declare him as fail in the 
interview process solely for the reason that he was 
involved in a criminal case. It is presumed that the 
interview committee must have given marks to the 
petitioner on the basis of his suitability for 
appointment to the said post by judging his ability 
and as the petitioner could not fulfill the requisite 
criteria, therefore, he was not selected, hence, has not 
been able to make out a case for this Court to 
interfere in the interview process or the marks 
awarded therein.  
8.    
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
judgment reported as 2000 SCMR 966 (ASIF 
MAHMOOD CHUGHTAI, ADVOCATE and 17 others 
versus GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB through Chief 
Secretary and others) has held that candidates having 
passed written test but failed in interview to obtain 
the 
qualifying 
marks 
were 
rightly 
declined 
appointment. The same principle is applicable to the 
case of the petitioner.  

 
W.P. No. 78710 of 2022

9.   
The judgment relied upon by the petitioner 
in the case of Amjad Latif (supra) is of no help to the 
petitioner as in the said case the written examination 
was based on two papers i.e. Mathematics and 
General Knowledge, reserving 100 marks for each 
paper and the department reserved 100 marks for 
viva voce. In the said circumstances, the court 
observed that reserving of 33% marks for interview 
had upset the merit list as a whole for that reason the 
court reached the conclusion in the said case that 
marks had not been properly apportioned and had not 
been awarded to candidates in a transparent manner, 
which had upset the merit list. On the other hand, in 
the present case, it is not the case of the petitioner 
that the marks of the interview were reserved 
excessively so that the merit list had been disturbed 
by award of higher marks to some candidates to the 
exclusion of the others, rather the petitioner has 
failed in interview on the basis of assessment by 
respondents on the basis of criteria fixed for 
considering the case of each candidate for 
appointment as Constable keeping in view the 
requirements of duties for the said job, which 
petitioner has failed to clear in interview, hence, his 
case is distinguishable from the afore-referred case 
on facts. 
10. 
In view of what has been discussed above, 
as the petitioner has failed in interview by obtaining 
7 out of 20 marks in the interview process, he is not 
entitled to any relief. As the matter has been decided 
on the basis of failure of the petitioner in interview, 
therefore, 
the 
matter 
relating 
to 
petitioner’s 
involvement in the F.I.R/criminal case has not been 
addressed by this Court.   

 
W.P. No. 78710 of 2022 
6 
 
11.  
For what has been discussed above, the 
petitioner has failed to make out any case for 
interference by this Court. Consequently, this 
constitutional petition being devoid of any merit is 
dismissed.
