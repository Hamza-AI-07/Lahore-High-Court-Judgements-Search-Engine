ORDER 
JAWAD HASSAN, J.----The Petitioner through this writ Petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the "Constitution") has called in question the 
order dated 16.05.2017, passed by the Respondent No.2/Chief Executive Officer, District 
Education Authority, Sialkot, whereby his appeal against termination of his contract was 
rejected. 
2. Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the Petitioner was appointed as an 
Elementary School Educator on 30.09.2002 on contract basis, which was extended from time to 
time. He added that unfortunately he got involved in a false criminal case, convicted and 
sentenced to life imprisonment against which he filed Appeal before this Court, which was 
accepted and he was acquitted of the charge. Thereafter the Petitioner filed an Application before 
the Respondent No.2 for his reinstatement into service, which was rejected vide the impugned 
order dated 16.05.2017. He added that impugned termination order infringed Petitioner's 
fundamental rights of life (Article 9), right of exploitation (Article 3) as well as right of 
livelihood (Articles 37 and 38) as guaranteed by the Constitution, hence the same are liable to be 
set aside. Learned, counsel to strengthen his arguments relied on the judgments reported as "Dr. 
Muhammad Islam v. Government of N.W.F.P. through Secretary, Food, Agriculture, Livestock 
and Cooperative Department, Peshawar and 2 others" (1998 SCMR 1993), "Superintending 
Engineer GEPCO Sialkot v. Muhammad Yousaf" (2007 SCMR 537) and "Director General, 
Intelligence Bureau, Islamabad v. Muhammad Javed and others" (2012 SCMR 165). 
3. Learned Law Officer objected to the maintainability of this petition in the light of the report 
and parawise comments and defended the impugned order being passed in accordance with law. 
Further averred that the Petitioner was treated as per terms and conditions of his contract 
employment which he duly accepted at the time of appointment, therefore, now at this stage he 
cannot deviate from the same. Moreover, no provision of Appeal exists under the contract 
Rules/Policy, therefore, this Petition be dismissed. 
4. Heard. Record perused. 
5. The bare perusal of the record reveals that Petitioner was appointed as an Elementary School 
Educator on 30.09.2002 on the basis of contract, which was extended from time to time. In the 
year 2008, the Petitioner was involved in a criminal case, wherein he was convicted and 
sentenced to life imprisonment, against which he filed Appeal before this Court, which was 
accepted and he was acquitted of the charge. Record also reveals that during proceedings of 
aforesaid trial, the District Education Officer (M), Elementary Education, Sialkot

cancelled/terminated the Petitioner contract vide order dated 26.03.2011. On acquittal from the 
aforesaid criminal case, the Petitioner filed an Application/Appeal before the Respondent No.2 
for reinstatement into service, which was rejected vide the impugned order dated 16.05.2017. 
The relevant paragraph of the impugned order is as under: 
"As per notification of Government of the Punjab, Education Department (School Wing) notified 
vide No.SO(SE-IV)3-67/06, dated 05.09.2006, relevant Para 2 wherefrom, is that "As per terms 
and conditions of Educator appointed, on contract basis, if contract of an employee is terminated, 
the employee cannot be re-instated, hence the undersigned feels no good grounds/reasons to 
interfere in the order vide No.1686-87/ Enq. Dated 26.03.2011, passed by the Competent 
Authority, i.e. District Education Officer (EE-M), Sialkot." 
The Report and parawise comments also depicts that the Petitioner was treated as per terms and 
conditions of his contract employment which he duly accepted at the time of appointment, 
therefore, now at this stage he cannot deviate from the same. Moreover, no provision of Appeal 
exists under the contract Rules/Policy. When confronted with this situation, learned counsel for 
the Petitioner has no satisfactory reply to it. Moreover, the case laws relied upon by learned 
counsel for the Petitioner, are distinguishable and not applicable in this case. 
6. Even otherwise issue relates to the policy matter and this Court cannot interfere into the policy 
matters of the Government, particularly when it is in the public interest. It is not in the domain of 
the Courts to embark upon an inquiry as to whether a particular merit policy is wise and 
acceptable or whether better policy could be evolved. The Court can only interfere if the policy 
framed is absolutely capricious and non-informed by reasons, or totally arbitrary, offending the 
basic requirement of the Constitution. It was for the Government to decide on how and in what 
manner the appointments should be made and such a policy decision normally would not be open 
to challenge subject to its passing the test of reasonableness. Reliance is placed on "Dr. Akhtar 
Hassan Khan and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others" (2012 SCMR 455) and "Pakistan 
Medical and Dental Council, Islamabad through Authorized Representative v. Maleeha Syed and 
4 others" (PLD 2020 Lahore 16). 
7. In view of above, the instant petition, being not maintainable, is hereby dismissed. 
SA/M-56/L Petition dismissed.
