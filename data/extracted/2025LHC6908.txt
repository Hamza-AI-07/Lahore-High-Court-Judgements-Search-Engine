Through this constitution petition, the 
petitioner (who was defendant in the suit) has called in 
question order passed by learned Judge Family Court, 
Lahore dated 19.11.2025 (‘Impugned order’), whereby 
his right to file written statement was closed.  
2.  
 
 Learned counsel for the petitioner states 
that sufficient opportunities were not provided to the 
petitioner to file written statement in the family suit 
filed by respondent Nos. 2 and 3 before hastily closing 
his right to file the same, which has caused prejudice to 
his right to defend the suit filed against him.  
3. 
 
The operative portion of the impugned 
order is reproduced below:- 
“Today the case was fixed for submission of 
written statement and payment of cost but 
neither written statement has been submitted 

2 
W.P.No. 71055 of 2025 
nor cost has been paid. Learned counsel for the 
defendant requested for an adjournment the 
same has vehemently been opposed by the 
learned counsel for the plaintiff. Sufficient time 
has been granted to the defendant for filing of 
written statement but the same has not been 
filed. Hence, right of defendant for submission 
of written statement is closed. Now to come up 
for personal appearance for the parties for pre-
trial-reconciliation for 03.12.2025.” 
 
4.  
  
Perusal of the record shows that Sakeena 
Bibi (respondent No. 2) and Jannat (minor, daughter of 
parties) as plaintiffs on 18.06.2025 filed a consolidated 
suit 
for 
dissolution 
of 
marriage, 
recovery 
of 
maintenance allowance, dowry articles and delivery 
expenses against the petitioner in the Family Court 
Lahore, in which the petitioner was proceeded against 
ex-parte as he did not appear on 14.07.2025 after 
service through Registered Post A.D, TCS and 
publication, and thereafter appeared in the court on 
29.07.2025 and filed an application for setting aside ex-
parte proceedings, which was contested by the 
respondents, 
where-after 
through 
order 
dated 
15.10.2025, the same was allowed with the result that 
ex-parte proceedings against the petitioner were set-
aside subject to costs of Rs. 1000/- and the matter was 
adjourned for 25.10.2025 for submission of written 
statement and payment of costs. On 25.10.2025, due to 
the previous outbreak of fire on 16.10.2025 in the LDA 
Building, where the court room is situated, the case was 

3 
W.P.No. 71055 of 2025 
adjourned for 19.11.2025 for proceedings as per 
previous order, on which date costs and written 
statement were not submitted by the petitioner resulting 
in closure of his right to file the same. The petitioner 
seeks another opportunity to file written statement by 
claiming that sufficient opportunity was not provided to 
the petitioner to do the needful before the right was 
hastily closed by stating that as per law the Family 
Court and this Court were competent to extend time for 
filing written statement.  
5. 
 
In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 9 of 
the Family Courts Act, 1964, the petitioner is required 
to file written statement within 15-days of his 
appearance before the court, which time may be 
extended by the court if the petitioner shows sufficient 
cause that prevented him to file written statement within 
time. The said Section is reproduced below:- 
“Section 9(1). On the date fixed under section 8, the 
defendant shall appear before the Family Court and 
file the written statement, a list of witnesses and gist 
of evidence, and in case the written statement is not 
filed on that date, the Family Court may, for any 
sufficient reasons which prevented the defendant 
from submitting the written statement, allow the 
defendant to submit the written statement and other 
documents on the next date which shall not exceed 
fifteen days from that date.” 
 
6.  
 
Question of providing further time to the 
defendant to file written statement came up for 
consideration before this Court in case titled Sajawal 
versus Judge Family Court, District Multan and another 

4 
W.P.No. 71055 of 2025 
(2020 YLR 359), wherein right to file written statement 
was struck off on the ground that despite availing 
number of opportunities, petitioner had failed to file 
written statement within the statutory period. This Court 
set-aside the said order and provided opportunity to 
submit the same subject to costs while observing as 
under:- 
“2. After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner 
and perusing the file, it is straightaway observed that 
the respondent filed a suit for maintenance allowance 
and dower on 31.5.2018 in which the petitioner 
appeared on 15.9.2018 whereafter on 23.10.2018, 
3.12.2018 and 5.1.2019 the petitioner was given 
opportunities to submit the written statement but he 
could not submit the same on account of unavoidable 
circumstances. Under section 9(1) read with section 
9(5A) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, a 
period of 15 days is provided for the said purpose. 
However, if the petitioner could establish sufficient 
reasons which prevented him for filing the written 
statement, such time can be extended in the interest of 
justice. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that on 
two occasions the learned Presiding Officer was on 
leave and that he will file the written statement before 
the Family Court on the next date of hearing i.e. 
5.4.2019 if so permitted by the Court against an 
appropriate cost.  
3. In this view of the matter and keeping in view the 
valuable rights of the petitioner to defend himself before 
the Family Court and referring to Article 10-A of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
(Right to Fair Trial) prescribing right to defend as a 
fundamental right, I allow this writ petition, set-aside 
the order dated 6.2.2019 passed by the Family Court 
and permit the petitioner to submit written statement on 
5.4.2019 subject to payment of cost Rs.5000/- to the 
respondent on the said date.” 
 
7. 
 
In the case in hand, the claim of the 
petitioner is that on the previous date fixed on 
25.10.2025, the court was not working due to outbreak 
of fire in the LDA Building and so sufficient 
opportunities were not provided to the petitioner to file 

5 
W.P.No. 71055 of 2025 
written statement, which right was closed in a hasty 
manner. Admittedly, ex-parte proceedings previously 
initiated against the petitioner were set-aside on 
15.10.2025 and matter was adjourned to 25.10.2025 for 
submission of written statement and payment of costs. 
However, on the adjourned date due to previous 
outbreak fire on 16.10.2025 in the building, where court 
is situated, the case was adjourned for 19.11.2025, when 
said right had been closed. Thus, practically, 19.11.2025 
was the first date fixed for filing of written statement as 
on the previous date fixed on 25.10.2025, court work 
was not possible as per showing of the court order itself 
that case had been adjourned due to outbreak of fire in 
the building. The counsel for the petitioner on the said 
adjourned date made a request for adjournment to 
comply with the previous orders, which was declined 
and the right of the petitioner was closed, which appears 
to be prima facie done in a hasty manner and without 
appreciation of record and application of mind as the 
court did not point out in the said order that how many 
opportunities had been previously granted that were 
treated as sufficient time and opportunity by the court to 
proceed against the petitioner. It is pertinent to mention 
here that a notice was circulated by the office of the 
Senior Civil Judge, Lahore on 16.10.2025 directing the 
lawyers not to go towards the LDA Judicial Complex 

6 
W.P.No. 71055 of 2025 
Building of the Civil Courts as efforts were being made 
to extinguish the fire in the said building and due to the 
same the record of some of the courts had also been 
shifted for safe keeping. In this view of the matter, on 
the next date fixed for proceedings as per previous 
order, the decision to close the right to file written 
statement seems to have been passed in haste. Although 
in the case titled as Hanif Brothers versus Federation of 
Pakistan and others (1999 CLC 520 [Karachi]) it is 
laid down that mere expediency of a case could not 
always mean a hasty and hurried decision without 
application of judicious mind, yet the court where the 
said decision has been called in question is always 
competent to see whether the decision issued due to 
expediency has advanced the cause of justice or has 
resulted in prejudice to the rights of any party and for 
that purpose the court has always to keep in mind the 
two time tested principles that ‘Justice delayed is justice 
denied’ and ‘Justice hurried is justice buried’ and 
balance has to be kept between these two principles to 
avoid prejudice to any party. Reliance is placed on Syed 
Saeed Muhammad Shah and another versus The State 
(1993 SCMR 550). Hasty decisions that cause prejudice 
to a party are generally deprecated by courts as is 
evident from the principles laid down in judgments 
reported as Muhammad Shamim Siddiqui versus Mrs. 

7 
W.P.No. 71055 of 2025 
Kausar Aziz (1988 MLD 1613 [Karachi]) wherein 
hasty decision made without application of judicial 
mind was set-aside and the matter was remanded for re-
trial. Reliance can also be placed on case reported as 
Sheikh Abdul Majeed versus Tayab Ali (1984 MLD 793 
[Karachi]) wherein the court set-aside the decision by 
holding the same to be without lawful authority by 
observing that hasty proceedings taken without having 
regard to provisions of law or demand of justice are 
without jurisdiction. In the case of Habib Bank Limited 
versus Hazrat Hussain (2005 CLD 1541 Peshawar) the 
court held that impugned judgment and order was the 
result of hasty decision which was not only deficient in 
its contents, but also bad in Law and the Law favoured 
decision of cases on merits and not on mere 
technicalities, and interest of justice required the 
decision to be based on merits. The Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has deprecated hasty decision at any stage of 
the proceedings in case reported as Mst. Safia Bano and 
another versus Home Department Government of 
Punjab through Secretary and others (PLD 2021 SC 
488). 
8. 
  
In a previous case, where right of the 
petitioner to file written statement was closed (reported 
as Muhammad Waseem versus Rehana Kausar, etc. 
(2025 LHC 5566)) this Court extended the time to file 

8 
W.P.No. 71055 of 2025 
written statement where the defendant in a Family Suit 
could not file written statement within time due to 
incorrect advice of his counsel from mufassil.  
9. 
  
In view of the above, as the impugned order 
prima facie appears to have been passed in a haste 
without consultation of record and is a non-speaking 
order resulting in prejudice to the right of the petitioner 
of fair trial provided under Article 10-A of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, 
hence, while dispensing with notice to the other side lest 
it may cause un-necessary expense to the other party 
and delay the matter, this Writ Petition is allowed and 
the petitioner is provided one opportunity to file written 
statement, for which purpose the petitioner shall appear 
along with attested copy of this order on the next date of 
hearing fixed before the learned trial court and the trial 
court shall receive the written statement submitted by 
the petitioner. This order shall not absolve the petitioner 
from making payment of costs previously imposed upon 
him by the Family Court for setting aside ex-parte 
proceedings against him. In case the petitioner does not 
appear before the learned trial court on the next date of 
hearing for submission of written statement, the trial 
court will be at liberty to proceed further with the matter 
in accordance with law. It is made clear that as the order 
has been passed in the absence of the respondents, if the 

9 
W.P.No. 71055 of 2025 
respondents are not satisfied with this arrangement, they 
may file an application for re-hearing the matter and 
decision of the same after hearing both the parties.
