SADIQ MAHMUD KHURRAM, J.  Through this petition 
filed under sections 435 and 439 Cr.P.C., the petitioner has assailed 
the order dated 26.09.2023 passed by the learned Additional Sessions 
Judge, Dera Ghazi Khan whereby the application submitted by the 
petitioner under section 540 Cr.P.C. seeking the summoning and 
examination of Allah Bachaya was dismissed by the learned trial 
court. 
2.           The brief facts of the case leading up to the filing of the 
instant petition are that the petitioner namely Mst. Haseena Mai 
initially got lodged the F.I.R.  No.23 of 2019 dated 14.01.2019

Dilawar. Thereafter, being dissatisfied by the investigation conducted 
by the policing authorities, the petitioner filed a private complaint 
titled “Haseena Mai Vs. Nadir and two others” and after the 
preliminary inquiry of the said private complaint, the learned trial 
court summoned the respondents No.2 to 4 to face the trial of the case 
in respect of offences under sections 302 and 34 PPC. The learned 
trial court, during the trial of the case, framed the charge against the 
accused which they denied and claimed trial. Subsequently, the 
complainant of the case proceeded to get her witnesses examined and 
the learned trial court also recorded the statements of as many as nine 
witnesses as court witnesses. Subsequently, the complainant of the 
case got recorded her statement on 04.09.2023, closing the 
prosecution evidence. The learned trial court proceeded to examine 
the accused facing the trial under section 342 Cr.P.C. on 06.09.2023 
and the accused claimed innocence however did not make any 
statement under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in 
their defence. Subsequent to the recording of the statements of the 
accused during the course trial of trial under section 342 Cr.P.C., the 
petitioner moved the application in question on 19.09.2023 and the 
learned trial court proceeded to dismiss the said application vide order 
dated 26.09.2023, hence, the petition.  
2.  
 
The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that  the 
order dated 26.09.2023 passed by the learned Additional Sessions 
Judge whereby he proceeded to dismiss the application of the 
petitioner seeking the summoning and examination of Allah Bachaya 
was liable to be set-aside being against the facts and law; that the

name of Allah Bachaya was duly mentioned in the private 
complainant as lodged by the petitioner and it was also mentioned by 
the complainant and her witnesses at the time of recording of their 
statements before the learned trial court; that Allah Bachaya was a 
witness whose examination was essential for the just decision of the 
case, therefore, he was sought to be summoned and examined.  
3.  
 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the 
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents No.2 to 4 
submit that the order dated 26.09.2023 passed by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge does not suffer from any illegality, 
meriting any interference of the same.  
4. 
     I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the 
learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
respondents No.2 to 4 and perused the record with their able 
assistance.  
5.           A perusal of the record reveals that the petitioner namely 
Mst. Haseena Mai initially got lodged the F.I.R.  No.23 of 2019 dated 
14.01.2019 registered in respect of offences under sections 302 and 34 
PPC at the Police Station Drahma, District Dera Ghazi Khan, detailing 
the circumstances of the Qatl-i-Amd of her son namely Muhammad 
Dilawar. Thereafter, being dissatisfied by the investigation conducted 
by the policing authorities, the petitioner filed a private complaint 
titled “Haseena Mai Vs. Nadir and two others” and after the 
preliminary inquiry of the said private complaint, the learned trial 
court summoned the respondents No.2 to 4 to face the trial of the case 
in respect of offences under sections 302 and 34 PPC. The learned

trial court, during the trial of the case, framed the charge against the 
accused which they denied and claimed trial. Subsequently, the 
complainant of the case proceeded to get her witnesses examined and 
the learned trial court also recorded the statements of as many as nine 
witnesses as court witnesses. Subsequently, the complainant of the 
case got recorded her statement on 04.09.2023, closing the 
prosecution evidence. The learned trial court proceeded to examine 
the accused facing the trial under section 342 Cr.P.C. on 06.09.2023 
and the accused claimed innocence however did not make any 
statement under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in 
their defence. Subsequent to the recording of the statements of the 
accused during the course trial of trial under section 342 Cr.P.C., the 
petitioner moved the application in question on 19.09.2023 and the 
learned trial court proceeded to dismiss the said application vide order 
dated 26.09.2023. A perusal of the application as submitted by the 
petitioner under section 540 Cr.P.C seeking the summoning of witness 
namely Allah Bachaya reveals that in the said application it had been 
mentioned that the said Allah Bachaya was the father of the deceased 
and was the one who had also arrived at the place where the deceased 
breathed his last, however, for the fact that soon after the occurrence 
which had taken place on 14.01.2019, as Allah Bachaya had to 
proceed abroad on 22.01.2019 and only returned to Pakistan on 
05.10.2021, therefore, he could not be named a witness in the list of 
witnesses appended with the private complaint lodged by the 
petitioner and was sought to be summoned by the said application. 
Regardless of the fact as to whether Allah Bachaya had to proceed to 

Criminal Revision No.336 of 2023

the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, soon after the occurrence on 
22.01.2019 and returned to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan only on 
05.10.2021,the fact remains that only fact which is sought to be 
proved by the production of Allah Bachaya is that on the asking of the 
deceased he was summoned by Mst. Haseena Bibi and when he 
arrived at the place where  the deceased was present, the deceased had 
already died. This fact that Allah Bachaya was asked to be summoned 
by the deceased and it was on the asking of Mst. Haseena Mai that 
Allah Bachaya arrived at the place where the deceased was present 
however had already breathed his last, has already been given 
evidence of by Mst. Haseena Bibi, who has appeared before the 
learned trial court and has got her statement recorded as PW-1. 
Similar statement has been made by Mst. Fatima (PW-2) also. This 
fact that Allah Bachaya had arrived at the place where the deceased 
had breathed his last, has already been given evidence of by both the 
witnesses namely Mst. Haseena Mai (PW-1) and Mst. Fatima (PW-2).  
Even otherwise, the learned counsel for the petitioner has not 
mentioned in the application submitted before the learned trial court 
for the summoning of Allah Bachaya as to in what manner  the  arrival 
of Allah Bachaya at the place where the deceased had already 
breathed his last, was a fact in issue or even a relevant fact. The mere 
arrival of Allah Bachaya at the place where the dead body of the 
deceased was present has no bearing or relevancy for the just decision 
of the case. The evidence related to fact in issue and relevant facts has 
already been given by the prosecution witnesses as produced before 
the learned trial court.  Furthermore, the learned trial court has already 

Criminal Revision No.336 of 2023

recorded statements of as many as nine court witnesses, who it 
thought were essential for the just decision of the case. When in the 
estimation of the learned trial court the evidence of Allah Bachaya is 
not essential for the just decision of the case and when even otherwise 
the statement intended to be made by Allah Bachaya has no bearing 
upon the prosecution case and the facts in issue and the relevant facts, 
then his summoning cannot be justified under the provisions of 
section 540 of Cr.P.C. Then it is also a fact that the trial of the case 
has been instituted upon the private complaint as filed by the 
petitioner herself and it has not been explained at all as to why Allah 
Bachaya was not cited as a witness in the calendar of witnesses 
appended with the private complaint itself. If the witness namely 
Allah Bachaya was an essential witness then he must have been 
sought to be examined and his name must have been mentioned in the 
calendar of witnesses appended with the private complaint itself, 
which was not. It is also a fact that Allah Bachaya had already 
returned to Pakistan on 05.10.2021 whereas the complainant closed 
her  evidence on 04.09.2023. Till 04.09.2023, the complainant of the 
case never made an application for seeking permission to produce 
Allah Bachaya. The provisions of section 265-F Cr.P.C. provide the 
procedure for the production of the witnesses and under the provisions 
of section 265-F Cr.P.C., it has been provided that if the accused does 
not plead guilty, the court shall proceed to hear the complainant and 
take all such evidence as may be produced in support of the 
prosecution and it shall ascertain from the complainant the names of 
any persons likely to be aquainted with the facts of the case and to be

able to give evidence for the complainant and shall summon such 
persons to give evidence before it. It is only after the examination of 
the witnesses that the examination of the accused is conducted. In this 
case despite having an opportunity to apprise the learned trial court 
with regard to the production of Allah Bachaya, as a witness of the 
prosecution, the complainant did not do so though Allah Bachaya was 
very much available and present in Pakistan. All these facts amply 
prove that the petition as filed by the petitioner seeking the 
summoning of Allah Bachaya was rightly rejected.  
 
6.  
 
The learned counsel for the petitioner has also assailed 
the mode and manner of recording the statement of the respondent 
No.4 namely Riaz, whose statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. was 
recorded by use of video linking by the learned trial court. The 
learned counsel for the petitioner is not able to explain as to what 
prejudice has been caused to the prosecution case by such recording 
of the statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. of the respondent No.4 
namely Riaz by way of video link. Riaz (respondent No.4) has been 
duly examined by the learned trial court under section 342 Cr.P.C. and 
Riaz (respondent No.4) himself, has not raised any objection to the 
manner in which he has been examined. When there is no complaint 
by Riaz (respondent No.4) himself of facing any prejudice by the 
manner of the recording of his statement under section 342 Cr.P..C., 
the complainant has hardly any reason to do so.

In view of the above discussion, this petition, being 
meritless is dismissed.
