Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”), as common questions of law and 
facts are involved in all these constitutional petitions. 
2. 
The Petitioner in the instant petition and in connected petitions 
(hereinafter would be referred as the “Petitioners”) have impugned 
show cause notices of different dates (the “impugned notices”) issued 
by Respondent/Punjab Revenue Authority (the “PRA”) under the 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
provisions of the Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012 (the “Act”) 
whereby levy of provincial sales tax on the services have been 
imposed.  
I. 
OVERTURE 
3. 
The development of Alternate Dispute Resolution (“ADR”) in 
Pakistan has been influenced by the need to alleviate the 
overburdened judicial system which aims to provide more efficient, 
cost-effective and amicable dispute resolution alternatives, reducing 
the burden on Courts and improving access to justice for the public. 
This approach was first time introduced in tax matters by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in “FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others 
versus ATTOCK PETROLEUM LTD. ISLAMABAD” (2007 SCMR 
1095) (“Attock Petroleum case”) holding that “it would facilitate 
settlement of tax dispute without intervention of court through 
mediation and negotiation”. This concept of “ADR” in tax disputes 
has further been strengthened by Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
“COMMISSIONER INLAND REVENUE versus Messrs RYK MILLS” 
(2023 SCMR 1856) (“RYK Mills case”) holding that “issuance of a 
show cause notice also acts as a tool to resolve the issue in the pre-
litigation stage and a show cause notice can also be viewed as being 
akin to alternate dispute resolution as it provides a pre-litigation 
opportunity for the recipient to present their position and show 
cause”.  Further, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in “PROVINCE OF 
PUNJAB through Secretary C&W, Lahore, etc versus M/s HAROON 
CONSTRUCTION 
COMPANY, 
Government 
Contractor, 
etc.”  
(2024 SCMR 947) (“Haroon Construction Company case”)  held as 
well that “the courts should not only encourage mediation but 
also exhibit a pro-settlement bias and a pro-mediation bias”. 
The above reproduced principles and developed jurisprudence 
with regard to “ADR” is binding within the meaning of Article 
189 of the “Constitution”. In this case, the Court is intending to 
dispose and decide the controversy amongst parties by adopting 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
“ADR” for resolution of dispute in the light of guidelines, 
principles and jurisprudence laid by the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in above referred judgments.  
II. 
CONTEXT 
4. 
Present a succinct overview of the factual background relevant 
to the case is that the Petitioner No.1/Strategic Plans Division (the 
“SPD”) is controlled by the Petitioner No.2/National Command 
Authority (the “NCA”) under the National Command Authority Act, 
2010 (the “Act 2010”). The “SPD” functions as Secretariat of the 
Authority as defined under Section 2(a) of the “Act 2010” which 
functions and exercise its powers under Section 7 of the “Act 2010”. 
The Petitioners have an operational and statutory compulsion to 
perform specified functions in view of Section 7 of the “Act 2010” 
and it can be validly stated that certain services required in pursuance 
thereto may very well be deemed to be ancillary and incidental to the 
functions provided under Section 7 of the Act ibid. As per version of 
the Petitioners, they are aggrieved by the “impugned notices” issued 
by the Respondent No.1/PRA imposing an unlawful levy of provincial 
sales tax on the services; therefore, the same be declared as illegal 
having been issued without lawful authority.  
III. 
PETITIONERS’ SUBMISSIONS 
4. 
Mr. Ahmar Bilal Soofi, Sr. ASC has attacked on the authority 
of the “PRA” to impose sales tax on the Petitioners having no 
jurisdiction and while reading the preamble of the “Act 2010”, which 
clearly states that the “NCA” has been established for complete 
command and control over research, development, production and use 
of nuclear/space technologies as well as other related applications in 
various fields, besides providing safety and security of all personnel, 
facilities, information, installations or organizations and other 
activities or matters connected therewith or ancillary thereto; he has 
drawn attention towards the provision of Section 5 of the “Act 2010”, 
according to which, the “SPD” shall function as the Secretariat of the 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
NCA and shall be headed by a Director General to be appointed by 
the Chairman, on recommendation of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of the 
Staff Committee. He maintains that since the “SPD” is performing 
functions and acts of integral, ancillary and incidental nature in terms 
of items No.18 and 51 of the Federal Legislative List, thus no 
provincial sales tax is leviable on it under the “Act”. 
5. 
When confronted how writ is maintainable against the 
“impugned notices” as the “PRA” has only fixed a hearing and 
required representation on behalf of the Petitioners through a duly 
authorized legal counsel, Mr. Ahmar Bilal Sufi, Sr. ASC argued that 
the writ is maintainable against the show cause notice in the light of 
judgment passed by this Court in the case of “RELIANCE 
COMMODITIES (PRIVATE) LTD. versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN and others” (PLD 2020 Lahore 632=2020 PTD 1464) 
whereby it has been held that a writ petition is maintainable if the 
show cause notice has not lawfully been issued by the competent 
authority; or, if issuance of the show cause notice is ultra vires the 
relevant law and/or without jurisdiction or with malafide. He next 
argued that the nature of work/services being done by the Petitioner 
No.1 does not cover under the meaning and purport of services as 
defined in Section 2(38) of the “Act”. He has further placed reliance 
on the judgment passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan on similar 
issue in the case of “SINDH REVENUE BOARD THROUGH 
CHAIRMAN GOVERNMENT OF SINDH and another versus THE 
CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY OF PAKISTAN THROUGH 
AIRPORT MANAGER” (2017 SCMR 1344), which discusses scope 
of the (aforesaid) items No.18 and 51 of the Federal Legislative List 
and holds that matters of common concern to the federating units of 
Pakistan are attended to by the Federal Legislature and the Federal 
Government has the power to exercise executive authority in respect 
of all such matters itself or through an authority in terms of Articles 
97 and 98 of the Constitution. Learned counsel for the Petitioners 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
lastly relied on the judgment reported as “STATE BANK OF 
PAKISTAN versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and 4 others” 
(PLD 2023 Lahore 392).  
III. 
RESPONDENTS’ SUBMISSIONS 
6. 
Learned Law Officer as well as learned counsel for the 
Respondent/PRA unanimously objected to the maintainability of these 
petitions by submitting that the “impugned notices” have rightly been 
issued by the “PRA” as per law and there is no occasion for this Court 
to intervene into the matter. 
7. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
8. 
Out of divergent contentions of the parties following points of 
determination are framed by this Court: 
IV. 
POINTS OF DETERMINATION 
1. Whether Writ is maintainable against Show Cause Notice? 
2. Whether Show Cause Notice must satisfy the principles of 
natural justice? 
3. Whether Show Cause Notice matters can be referred for 
Mediation? 
 
9. 
Now, I will discuss points of determination respectively as 
under: 
POINT NO.1 (Maintainability of writ petition against show cause notice) 
 
10. 
There is no cavil to the proposition that mere issuance of 
notice or a show-cause notice is not an adverse order and a petition 
under Article 199 of the “Constitution” would not be competent. 
The exception to this general rule is a grievance relating to the 
notice or show-cause notice suffering from want of jurisdiction. 
Where the show-cause notice is so patently illegal, void or wanting 
in jurisdiction that any further recourse to alternative remedy might 
only be counterproductive and by invoking Article 199 the mischief 
could forthwith be nipped in the bud then in such matters existence 
of alternative remedy would not bar the exercise of Constitutional 
jurisdiction. Reliance is placed on “MUSLIM COMMERCIAL 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
BANK LIMITED versus DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-
TAX and others” (2004 PTD 1901), “CHAUDHARY SUGAR 
MILLS LIMITED versus CHIEF COMMISSIONER and 2 others” 
(2016 PTD 527) and “NORTHERN POWER GENERATION 
COMPANY LTD. Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and 
others” (2015 PTD 2052). It has been held by the Supreme Court 
in the judgment titled “COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX versus 
ELI LILLY PAKISTAN (PVT.) LTD.” (2009 SCMR 1279) that the 
rule barring jurisdiction in the case of exercising powers under 
Article 199 of the “Constitution” when a show-cause notice has 
been assailed is not an absolute rule, but rather a rule by which the 
jurisdiction is regulated. The exercise of jurisdiction in the case of a 
show-cause notice has been held to be justified when the said notice 
is without jurisdiction or mala fide. The relevant portion of the 
judgment is reproduced for ready reference “The tendency to 
bypass the remedy provided in the relevant statute and to press into 
service constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court was to be 
discouraged, though in certain cases invoking of such jurisdiction 
instead of availing the statutory remedy was justified, e.g. when the 
impugned order/action was palpably without jurisdiction and/or 
mala fide.” Further reliance is placed on "GATRON (INDUSTRIES) 
LTD. versus GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN and others" (1999 
SCMR 1072) and "MURREE BREWERY CO. LTD. versus 
PAKISTAN THROUGH SECRETARY TO GOP, WORKS AND 
DIVISION and 2 others" (PLD 1972 SC 279). This Court in 
exercise of its extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction may take up 
writs to challenge the show cause notice if it is found to be lack of 
jurisdiction, barred by law or abuse of process of the court or coram 
non judice. Reliance is place on “RELIANCE COMMODITIES 
(PRIVATE) LTD. versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others” 
(PLD 2020 Lahore 632) and “DR. SEEMA IRFAN and others 
versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN” (PLD 2019 Sindh 519). 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 
Moreover, it is pertinent to refer to the precedent law expounded by 
the Supreme Court of India with regard to entertaining 
constitutional petition when the challenge is against a show-cause 
notice. It is well settled principle propounded by the Court that 
ordinarily no writ lies against a show-cause notice. It has been a 
consistent view of the Court in India that a mere show-cause notice 
is not an adverse order and, therefore, the petition invoking 
jurisdiction against a show-cause notice is considered premature. 
The only two exceptions to the rule that ordinarily writ will not be 
issued against a show-cause notice are, (a) when the Court is 
satisfied that the show-cause notice is totally non est. i.e. want of 
jurisdiction of the issuing authority and (b) issued malafidely. 
Reliance is placed on “Union of India (UOI) and others versus 
Vicco Laboratories” ((2007) 13 SCC 270). The relevant portion of 
the judgment is reproduced for ready reference “Normally, the writ 
court should not interfere at the stage of issuance of show cause 
notice by the authorities. Where a show-cause notice is issued 
either without jurisdiction or in an abuse of process of law, 
certainly in that case, the writ court would not hesitate to interfere 
even at the stage of issuance of show-cause notice. The interference 
at the show-cause notice stage should be rare and not in a routine 
manner.” 
11. 
A discreet analysis of the aforementioned case law reveals 
that the consistent view of the Pakistani and Indian Courts has been 
that a mere show-cause notice is not an adverse order. However, the 
Court in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction could take up 
writs to challenge the show-cause notice if it is found that the 
show-cause notice is totally non est i.e. want of jurisdiction of the 
issuing authority or has been issued malafidely i.e. merely to harass 
the subject. In the light of the settled principles, it may be 
concluded as follows:-- 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
i. 
Show-cause notice is not an adverse order 
unless it could be clearly shown to the 
satisfaction of the Court that it has been issued 
by an authority not vested with jurisdiction or it 
was issued for mala fide reasons. 
ii. 
The exception relating to want of jurisdiction 
does not include every jurisdictional error. A 
wrong exercise of jurisdiction or interpretation 
of the law cannot be treated as want of 
jurisdiction. 
iii. 
Constitutional jurisdiction is exercised if the 
Court is satisfied that the person is an 
'aggrieved party' within the context of Article 
199 of the Constitution and no adequate remedy 
is provided by law. If adequate statutory 
remedies are provided under the relevant 
statute, it is to be taken into consideration while 
exercising discretion under Article 199 of the 
Constitution. 
iv. 
By passing or circumventing statutory forums is 
to be discouraged. 
v. 
The approach should be to advance the object 
and purpose of a statute and every effort made 
to uphold the sanctity of the legislative intent 
rather defeating it. 
 
POINT NO.2 (Show Cause Notice on principles of natural justice) 
 
12. 
The Constitution guarantees the right to be treated according 
to law, and it upholds the principles of a fair trial and due process 
under Articles 4 and 10-A. Article 4 ensures every citizen’s 
inalienable right to enjoy legal protection and to be treated 
according to law. It also stipulates that no action that could harm a 
person’s life, liberty, body, reputation, or property can be taken 
unless it is in accordance with law. Furthermore, it prevents or 
hinders any person from doing anything that is not prohibited by 
law. Article 10-A of the “Constitution” establishes the fundamental 
right to a fair trial and due process. The issuance of a show cause 
notice is crucial in safeguarding these rights, as it gives individuals 
and organizations the chance to justify their actions and respond to 
allegations of law violation or non-compliance before any negative 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 
action is taken against them. Therefore, if a specific allegation is 
not presented to the recipient, denying them the opportunity to 
respond, any judgment on that allegation would violate the right to 
due process and a fair trial, contravening Articles 4 and 10A of the 
“Constitution”. 
13. 
A show cause notice is an official document issued by an 
Authority to inform a recipient of a potential violation or non-
compliance with a law, providing them an opportunity to respond. 
It upholds the principle of natural justice, ensuring a fair hearing 
before any decision affecting their rights or interests is made. The 
recipient is given adequate time to respond, access to relevant 
evidence, and an opportunity to be heard. This process ensures 
unbiased decision-making based on facts and relevant laws, 
protecting the recipient’s rights and interests. The principles of 
impartiality and reasons are also upheld, requiring the decision-
maker to be unbiased and provide reasons for their decision. Thus, 
a show cause notice is a crucial tool for law enforcement, ensuring 
a fair and transparent process before any adverse order is passed. 
Reliance is placed on “Siemens Engineering versus Union of India” 
(AIR 1976 SC 1785) and “S.N. Mukherjee versus Union of India” 
(AIR 1990 SC 1984) 
14. 
A show cause notice served to a taxpayer must encompass 
all essential facts and clearly outline the alleged actions or inaction 
by the taxpayer that breached the law, facilitating a substantial 
response from the taxpayer. It’s crucial that the taxpayer is faced 
with precise allegations, along with the basis for such allegations, 
to adequately respond and to record relevant material that would be 
necessary for any defense presented and for any adjudication by the 
assessing officer related to it. This is because once a show cause 
notice is served, the original adjudication on the said notice can 
only be founded on the grounds and allegations raised therein. 
Without confronting the taxpayer with the allegations through a 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
show cause notice, the assessing officer cannot make a 
determination regarding the said allegations as it exceeds the 
department’s competence to argue a case which the department had 
never proposed and the taxpayer had never been given the chance to 
address. Therefore, unless the allegations, and the grounds on 
which the said allegations are based, are specifically stated in the 
show cause notice served to the taxpayer, the entire process 
becomes futile and legally untenable. Reliance is placed on 
“Commissioner 
Inland 
Revenue 
versus 
Pakistan 
Tobacco 
Company” (2022 SCMR 1251); “Al-Khair Gadoon versus The 
Appellate Tribunal” (2019 SCMR 2018); “Raj Bahadur versus 
Union of India” ((1997) 6 SCC 81); “New Delhi Television versus 
Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax” (AIR 2020 SC 2177); 
“Collector of Central Excise versus H.M.M. Limited” (1995 Supp. 
(3) SCC 322) and SACI Allied Products versus Commissioner of 
Central Excise ((2005) 7 SCC 159). 
 
POINT NO.3 (Whether Show Cause Notice matters can be referred for Mediation) 
15. 
Today, during the course of arguments, this Court proactively 
played its due role to convince the parties to settle their dispute 
through mediation in terms of “RYK Mills case” and “Haroon 
Construction Company case” of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.  
Mr. Hassan Kamran Bashir, ASC for the Respondent/PRA under 
instructions submitted candidly that the Respondent/PRA is ready to 
mediate the matter regarding impugned notice(s). Mr. Ahmar Bilal 
Soofi, Sr. ASC for the Petitioners accepted the offer for mediation. 
V. 
ANTHOLOGY OF ADR/MEDIATION 
16. 
According to Halsbury’s Laws of England Fifth Edition (2008) 
Volume 2, Para 1204 an “Alternate dispute resolution (‘ADR’) is a 
term for describing the process of resolving disputes in place of 
litigation and includes mediation, conciliation, expert determination, 
and early neutral evaluation.” Mediation, a form of alternative dispute 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 
resolution (ADR), is praised for its efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and 
ability to foster amicable settlements. Unlike litigation’s adversarial 
nature, mediation promotes a collaborative approach for parties to find 
mutually beneficial solutions. Courts should encourage mediation and 
exhibit a pro-settlement and pro-mediation bias, favoring dispute 
resolution through mediation over litigation. This bias, favoring the 
mediation process itself, is based on the belief that settlements are 
generally more efficient and satisfactory for all parties compared to 
court-determined outcomes. By promoting a pro-settlement bias, 
courts can contribute to a harmonious and efficient dispute resolution 
environment, empowering parties to resolve conflicts collaboratively 
and constructively. This aligns with the broader goals of global justice 
systems to resolve disputes fairly, efficiently, and in a manner 
conducive to the long-term well-being of all parties involved. The 
centuries old traditional method of settlement of private dispute 
through negotiation is not only familiar in the modern world, but this 
voluntary scheme for settlement of tax dispute through mediation and 
negotiation is an effective method to be followed. There are various 
forms of ADR such as mediation, arbitration, conciliation and 
compromise with or without intervention of court. Reliance is placed 
on “Province of Punjab through Secretary C&W, Lahore, etc versus 
M/s Haroon Construction Company, Government Contractor, etc.” 
(2024 SCMR 947) and “Federation of Pakistan and others Vs. Attock 
Petroleum Ltd. Islamabad” (2007 SCMR 1095). Mediation offers a 
voluntary 
and 
confidential 
alternative 
to 
traditional 
court 
proceedings for resolving disputes. In this process, disputing parties 
willingly engage in discussions facilitated by a neutral third party 
known as the mediator. Unlike court proceedings, mediation is a 
more informal and flexible approach, fostering open communication 
and creative problem solving. Mediator's role is not to make 
decisions but to guide the parties in finding common ground and 
exploring potential solutions. One of the key advantages of 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 
mediation is its cost-effectiveness compared to court proceedings. It 
also tends to be a faster method of resolution, putting more control 
in the hands of the parties involved. Informality of mediation 
contributes to a quicker resolution compared to the often time-
consuming nature of court proceedings. Additionally, the process 
preserves relationships, as parties actively engage in finding 
mutually agreeable solutions. Flexibility of mediation allows for a 
more personalized and tailored resolution to the specific needs and 
concerns of the parties involved. Mediation not only saves time and 
money of parties, but it also reduces load of work in the courts as well 
as it is a most updated way on resolutions based on the “divine culture 
of Peace.” Reliance is placed on “FAISAL ZAFAR and another 
versus 
SIRAJ-UD-DIN 
and 
4 
others” 
(2024 
CLD 
1); 
“NETHERLANDS

VI. 
MEDIATION/ADR REGIME IN PAKISTAN 
17. 
There are several federal and provincial laws on Alternate 
Dispute Resolution in Pakistan i.e. 
i. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Act, 2017. 
 
ii. The Punjab Alternate Dispute Resolution Act, 2019. 
 
iii. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Alternate Dispute 
Resolution Act, 2020.

13 
18. 
In addition thereto, Section 89-A and Order IX-A of the Code 
of Civil Procedure, 1908 warrant process of Alternate Dispute 
resolution/mediation, whereas provisions of the Order IX-B ahead 
read as follows: 
“RULE 1: 
(1) 
Except where the Court is satisfied that 
there is no possibility of mediation or an intricate 
question of law or facts is involved, the Court 
shall refer the case for mediation. 
(2) 
While referring the matter for mediation, 
the Court may indicate the material issues for 
determination through mediation.  
RULE 2: 
Where a case is referred for mediation, the Court 
shall stay the proceedings for a period not 
exceeding thirty days and direct the parties to 
appear before the Mediation Centre, set up by 
Lahore High Court, on such date and time as the 
Court may specify. 
RULE 3: 
 (1) 
Where the mediation proceedings are 
successful and the parties have arrived at an 
agreement, the Mediator shall cause the same to 
be recorded in writing, signed by the parties or 
their recognized agents or their pleaders and 
attested by two independent witnesses. 
(2) 
The agreement shall be certified by the 
Mediator and transmitted forthwith, through the 
Administrator of the Mediation Centre, to the 
Court. 
(3) 
The Court shall, on receipt of the 
agreement, pass a decree in terms thereof unless 
the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, 
finds that the agreement between the parties is not 
enforceable at law. 
(4) 
Where the settlement relates only to a part 
of the dispute, the Court shall pass decree or an 
order in terms of such settlement and proceed to 
adjudicate the remaining issues. 
RULE 4: 
Where the meditation fails and no settlement is 
made between the parties, the Mediator shall 
submit a report to the Court and the Court shall 
proceed with the case from the stage it was 
referred to Mediation.” 
 
19. 
Moreover, Section 134-A (1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 
2001 (the “Ordinance”) states that “An aggrieved person in 
connection with any dispute pertaining to: (a) the liability of tax of 
one hundred million rupees or above against the aggrieved person or

14 
admissibility of refund, as the case may be; (b) the extent of waiver 
of default surcharge and penalty; or (c) any other specific relief 
required to resolve the dispute, may apply to the Board for the 
appointment of a committee for the resolution of any hardship or 
dispute mentioned in detail in the application, which is under 
litigation in any court of law or an appellate authority, except where 
criminal proceedings have been initiated.” The Rule 231-C in 
Chapter XIX of the Income tax Rules, 2002 is also available in 
connection thereto. Moreover, Sections 276 to 278 of the Companies 
Act, 2017 also set forth mode for Mediation or arbitration etc. 
Federal Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by section 
25 read with section 4 of aforementioned Alternative Dispute 
Resolution Act, 2017 has also framed ADR Mediation Accreditation 
(Eligibility) Rules, 2023 featuring accreditation and Notification,

and 
notification, ADR Register and suspension or revocation of 
accreditation.  
VII. MEDIATION BY THE PRA UNDER THE “ACT” 
20. 
The Preamble of the “Act” plainly demonstrates intent to 
expedite to reform and modernize the system of taxation, to provide 
assistance to tax payers, to promote compliance with fiscal laws, to 
establish a progressive and professionally efficient tax management 
organization, and to provide for ancillary matters. The Preamble of 
the Act laid strong emphasis to regulate the matters relating to 
taxation system, progressive & efficient tax administration 
management, to assist taxpayer and to promote compliance of fiscal 
laws. Section 5 of the “Act” envisages following functions of the 
PRA as Section 5 (1) states that the Authority shall exercise such 
powers and perform such functions as are necessary to achieve the 
purposes of this Act; Section 5 (2) (e) states that  the Authority shall 
have powers to  adopt modern effective tax administration methods, 
information technology systems and policies to consolidate 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15 
assessments, improve processes, organize registration of tax payers, 
widen the tax base, and make departmental remedies more efficient 
including enforcement of, or reduction or remission in duty, penalty 
or tax, in accordance with the relevant fiscal law; Section 5 (2) (o) 
states that  the Authority shall have powers to set up mechanism and 
processes for remedying the grievances and complaints of the tax 
payers; Section 5 (2) (q) states that  the Authority shall have powers 
to practice transparency and public participation as a norm for all its 
processes and policies. The mechanism of alternate dispute resolution 
has also been provided under Section 69 of the “Act” which reads as 
“SECTION 69:  
(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of 
this Act or the rules, any registered person 
aggrieved in connection with any dispute 
pertaining to– 
(a)  the liability of the tax against the 
registered person; 
(b)  the extent of waiver of default surcharge 
and penalty; 
(c)  relaxation of any procedural or 
technical irregularities and condonation of 
any prescribed time limitation; and 
(d) any other specific relief required to 
resolve the dispute, may apply to the 
Authority for the appointment of a 
committee for the resolution of any dispute 
mentioned in detail in the application. 
(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in 
sub-section (1), the Authority shall not 
accept an application under sub-section (1) 
where criminal proceedings have been 
initiated or where the Authority is of the 
opinion that the interpretation of a question 
of law having a larger impact on revenue or 
on a number of similar cases is involved. 
(3)  The Authority may, after examination 
of the application of a registered person, 
appoint a committee of not less than three 
persons within thirty days of receipt of such 
application, consisting of an officer of the 
Authority not below the rank of an 
Additional Commissioner and nominees 
from the notified panel consisting of 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16 
chartered or cost accountants, advocates, 
representatives 
of 
trade 
bodies 
or 
associations, retired officers of the rank of 
not less than BS-20, retired judges, or any 
other reputable taxpayers, for the resolution 
of the dispute. 
(4)  The committee constituted under sub-
section (3) shall examine the issue and may, 
if it deems fit, conduct an inquiry, seek 
expert opinions, direct any officer of the 
Authority or any other person to conduct an 
audit and shall make recommendations to 
the Authority within ninety days of its 
constitution in respect of the dispute. 
(5)  If the committee fails to make 
recommendations within the said period, the 
Authority may dissolve the committee and 
constitute a new committee which shall 
decide the matter within a further period of 
ninety days and even if after the expiry of 
that period the dispute is not resolved, the 
matter shall be taken up before the 
appropriate forum provided under this Act 
for decision. 
(6) 
 
The 
Authority 
may, 
on 
the 
recommendation of the committee, pass 
such order, as it may deem appropriate 
within forty-five days of the receipt of the 
recommendations of the committee. 
(7)  The registered person may make 
payment of the tax as determined by the 
Authority in its order under sub-section (6), 
and such order of the Authority shall be 
submitted before the forum, Appellate 
Tribunal or the Court where the matter is 
pending adjudication for consideration of 
orders as deemed appropriate. 
 
21. 
Now Question arises whether matters regarding issuance of 
show cause notice can be referred for mediation. This issue has 
already been settled by the Supreme Court in the case titled 
“COMMISSIONER INLAND REVENUE versus Messrs RYK MILLS” 
(2023 SCMR 1856) the relevant portion is reproduced for ready 
reference: 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023

“7.    A show cause notice can also be 
viewed as being akin to alternative 
dispute resolution ("ADR") as it provides 
a pre-litigation opportunity for the 
recipient to present their position and 
show cause. By doing so, the matter can 
potentially be resolved before it escalates 
and requires any adjudication. This not 
only saves time and resources but also 
encourages the efficient resolution of 
disputes, acting as an effective mode of 
resolving 
disputes 
outside 
of 
the 
traditional legal framework. Thus, while 
acting as a means to ensure due process 
and fair trial by allowing the recipient to 
explain their position and respond to the 
allegations before any legal action is 
taken, the issuance of a show cause 
notice also acts as a tool to resolve the 
issue in the pre-litigation stage, similar 
to the objective of ADR.” 
 
VIII. CONCLUSION 
22. 
Hence, with the mutual consent of parties and keeping in light 
preamble of the “Act” coupled with obligation of the “PRA” 
envisaged in its functions under Section 5 of the “Act”, the 
mechanism of ADR enacted in Section  69 of the “Act” and fetching 
guidelines from esteemed judgments of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in case “Attock Petroleum case”, “RYK Mills case” and 
“Haroon Construction Company case” mentioned supra, which are 
binding on this Court under Article 189 of the “Constitution”, this 
Court is of the considered view that the resolution of the issue in 
hand through ADR, assented by the learned counsels of both parties, 
is the need of day to afford parties with an opportunity for resolution 
of the matter through said medium under umbrella of requisite 
confidentiality, trust and compliance of law.  
24. 
Hence, these petitions stand disposed of with the observation 
that the representative(s) of the Petitioners shall appear before the 
Respondent No.1/PRA on 10.06.2024, who shall, with mutual 

W.P.No. 3973 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18 
understanding and consent of the parties shall proceed ahead with 
mechanism of ADR in accordance with law and esteemed guidelines 
of the Supreme Court of Pakistan discussed above in detail.  
In the meanwhile, under the Doctrine of Stopgap Arrangement as 
developed by this Court in the judgments cited as “SHELL 
PAKISTAN LIMITED versus GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB etc.” 
(2020 
PTD 
1607) 
and 
“SHAHEEN 
MERCHANT 
versus 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN/NATIONAL TARIFF COMMISSION 
and others” (2021 PTD 2126) no coercive measures shall be adopted 
against the Petitioners, till finalization of the mediation process.
