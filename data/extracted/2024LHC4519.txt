The Defence Housing Authority and 02 others 
JUDGMENT 
Date of Hearing: 
23.10.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Muhammad Riaz Chopra, Advocate 
Respondents by: 
Mr. Altaf-ur-Rehman Khan, Advocate 
Mr. Ishfaq Amir, Advocate 
 
ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: Through the instant constitutional 
Petition, the Petitioner has brought a challenge to Order dated 11.07.2023 
passed by Respondent No. 2 / Secretary of Defence Housing Authority 
(the “DHA”) and seeks a direction to DHA to issue „No Demand 
Certificates‟ (the “NDCs”) regarding the plots of the Petitioner in order to 
enable him to sell the same.  
2. 
Brief facts of this case are that initially, the Petitioner filed W. P. 
No. 73527 / 2021 before this Court asserting therein that he and his 
siblings inherited agricultural land from the estate of their deceased 
parents, out of which 200 Kanals was sold to DHA vide agreement dated 
26.01.2004 followed by registered sale deed dated 28.04.2004. Later, 
further land measuring 192 Kanals was sold, out of which, the Petitioner 
sold 75 Kanals pursuant to agreement executed in the year 2014 followed 
by registered sale deed dated 27.01.2015. As part of sale consideration, the 
Petitioner received a total of 36 exempted plots comprising of 11 
commercial plots and 25 residential plots. The above transactions were 
executed by the Petitioner with DHA on the basis of a general power of 
attorney dated 23.12.2003 granting power to Mr. Afzaal Elahee Chauhan

W. P. No. 8273 / 2024 
(his brother), inter alia, to sell his shares in the property. After the 
execution of registered sale deeds and allocation of the said plots, the 
transaction between the Petitioner and DHA became a past and closed 
transaction and he acquired all the property rights with respect to the 
allotted plots. Later, the Petitioner sold 12 plots to various private persons 
and was left with 24 plots. However, when he attempted to sell the same, 
NDCs regarding the same were withheld by DHA by marking a „caution‟ 
thereon which constrained him to file the said Writ Petition before this 
Court.  
3. 
Vide Order dated 23.05.2022, Writ Petition No. 73527 / 2021 was 
dismissed by holding that perusal of the contents of the pleadings of the 
parties indicates a dispute regarding enforcement of obligations arising out 
of certain agreements executed between them which being factual in 
character cannot be resolved without recording of evidence and the said 
exercise cannot be undertaken by this Court under Article 199 of the 
Constitution 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Pakistan, 
1973 
(the 
“Constitution”), therefore, the appropriate course for the Petitioner to 
adopt, in the given circumstances, is to approach the Civil Court concerned 
for redressal of his grievance.  
4. 
The Petitioner filed Intra Court Appeal No. 36580 / 2022 before this 
Court which was disposed of vide Order dated 30.03.2023 with the 
observation that as and when the Petitioner would approach the DHA 
through an appropriate application seeking reasons for rejection of 
applications for verification, the same shall be furnished. Pursuant thereto, 
the impugned Order in the titled Writ Petition was passed by Respondent 
No. 2 outlining the reasons for not issuing the NDCs with respect to 
remaining plots. The said reasons contained in the impugned Order are 
reproduced as under:- 
“a.  The land transferred by you was an un-partitioned joint share in a 
joint holding (Khata). You sold different Khasra numbers to DHA 
and are now offering different Khasra numbers and are thus 
committing breach of contract. 
b.  
Your real brother and General Attorney, Mr. Ifzaal Elahee 
Chauhan, who jointly sold/transferred the land measuring 392-

3 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 8273 / 2024 
Kanals 1-Marla from the joint ownership / khata of the family has 
filed a suit for partition and permanent injunction, with regard to 
the same land, including your share of un-partitioned land, which is 
pending in the court of Civil Judge, Lahore. The aforementioned suit 
pertains to the entire land comprising in Joint Khata, measuring 
968-Kanals 7-Marlas, out of which you, your siblings and your 
mother, (the “Chauhan Family”) transferred 392-Kanlas of land to 
DHA. Therefore, the matter of land transferred by you to DHA has 
become sub-judice in the said civil suit. 
c.  
The Chauhan Family sold land measuring 392-Kanals 1-Marla in 
Mauza Sangat Pura, Tehsil Cantt., District Lahore as per following 
detail:- 
(1)  
Land measuring 200-Kanls (First Tranche) through 
registered sale deed Document No.3421 Book No.1 Volume 
312 dated 28.4.2004 registered with Sub-Registrar Aziz Bhatti 
Town, Lahore. This sale deed was executed by the co-sharers 
as under:- 
(a)  
You and your sister Mst Ghazala Elahee executed the 
sale deed through your General Attorney Mr. Ifzaal 
Elahee Chauhan. 
(b)  
Mst Imtiaz Begum and Mst Tahira Elahee executed the 
sale deed directly. 
(2) 
The aforementioned land measuring 200-Kanals was earlier 
offered for sale through an Agreement dated 26.01.2004. In 
this Agreement 128 Qitaat had been offered for sale. The 
Khasra numbers are mentioned in the Agreement as well as 
the Sale Deed.  
(3)  
Land measuring 192-Kanals 01-Marla (Second Tranche) was 
sold through three separate sale deeds from the Joint Khata. 
You sold land measuring 75-Kanals through your General 
Attorney and a co-sharer in the Joint Khata, Mr. Ifzaal 
Elahee Chauhan vide registered sale deed Document No. 814 
Book No.1 Volume 1803 dated 27.1.2015 registered with Sub-
Registrar Wahga Town, Lahore. The remaining 117-Kanals 
01-Marla land was sold by Mr. Ifzaal Elahee Chauhan and 
Mst. Ghazala Elahee through separate sale deeds. This land 
had been offered by the Chauhan Family and accepted for 
sale through letter dated 03.10.2014 
d.  
The land measuring 192-Kanals 1-Marla (Second Tranche) was 
offered and sold as under:- 
(1)  
Land offer affidavit dated 17.09.2014 by you Mr. Sibghat 
Elahee Chauhan, regarding land measuring 70-K in Khasra 
Nos. 870, 873, 874, 875, 876, 884, 885, 886, 889 and 892, 
Mauza Sangat Pura. 
(2)  
Land offer affidavit dated 17.09.2014 by Mst. Ghazala Elahee 
regarding land measuring 47-K 01-M in Khasra in Khasra

W. P. No. 8273 / 2024 
Nos. 869, 887, 888, 898, 900, 903, 905 and 901, Khatooni 55 
to 61 Mauza Sangat Pura. 
(3)  
Land offer affidavit dated 17.09.2014 by Ifzaal Elahee in 
Khasra Nos. 893, 894, 895, 896, 897, 899, 901, 902 and 904 
falling in Khatooni 55 to 61 Khewat 30 Mauza Sangat Pura. 
(Copy of Khasra Girdawari of a/m Khasra Nos. in favour of 
Ifzaal Elahee Chauhan in proof of possession also attached). 
(4)  
DHA agreed to purchase the land offered for sale and 
possession as per Khasra Girdawari. 
3.  
You sold total 27-Khasras to DHA but handed-over possession of 
only 15-Khasras at that time. However, now you are offering 
possession of those Khasras which were not sold to DHA. These 
Khasras are even otherwise out of the DHA,s planned area. The 
detail of these Khasra numbers showing their old and new numbers 
is given below:- 
Old / New: 
824/870 
827/873 
828/874 
829/875 
830/876 
838/884 
839/885 
840/886 
843/889 
846/892 
4. 
A caution has been marked on the balance plots in view of the facts 
mentioned above is based on genuine, lawful and justifiable reasons 
explained above. Moreover, you and your co-sharer family members 
are now claiming different Khasra numbers than the ones they had 
sold under their Offer Letters and Agreements. 
5. 
You can claim only those plots which fell in the land (Khasras) sold 
by you to DHA and are not entitled to change the location of the 
plots at your will and wish. The sale has been stopped through the 
Caution as the co-sharer and your General Attorney has filed a suit 
for partition of the disputed land and seeks to grab back the 
valuable land sold to DHA and move DHA to a location which is 
outside the area earmarked for development by DHA. 
6.  
The Caution on the sale of your plots cannot be removed until the 
Suit for Partition of land, which includes the joint land transferred 
by you to DHA, is not decided. 
7.  
Articles 23 and 24 of the Constitution have no application / 
relevance to the instant case. Your relationship with the DHA is 
governed by the provisions of Transfer of Property Act, 1882, 
Contract Act, 1872, Land Revenue Act, 1967 and the Land Records 
Manual. 

5 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 8273 / 2024 
8.  
For the reasons stated above, your application is found baseless and 
without any sound justification and accordingly rejected.”   
5. 
The record depicts that pursuant to agreement dated 26.01.2004 
executed between the legal heirs of late Karam Elahee Chauhan and DHA, 
registered sale deed dated 28.04.2004 was executed between them through 
which the conveyed land was fully identified. The sale consideration in 
terms of the said sale deed in shape of cash and / or exempted plots was 
duly received by the vendors and possession was taken over by DHA, 
whereafter, the matter was concluded between them. Thereafter, pursuant 
to agreement executed in the year 2014, another sale deed dated 
27.01.2015 was duly executed between the Petitioner and DHA in which 
the conveyed land was duly identified. The payment of sale consideration 
in cash and / or exempted plots was duly received by the Petitioner and 
possession was taken over by DHA. As such, the said transaction was also 
duly concluded between the Petitioner and the DHA.  
6.  
Admittedly, 12 exempted plots have already been sold by the 
Petitioner after obtaining NDCs from DHA. Later, DHA marked a 
„caution‟ on the remaining plots and refused to issue NDCs. Admittedly, 
„caution‟ has been marked on the remaining plots of the Petitioner by 
DHA much after the concluded transaction with the Petitioner. DHA has 
raised an alleged dispute unilaterally by exercising its powers as a 
Regulator of DHA and not as a vendee against the Petitioner which fact is 
sufficient to hold that DHA has transgressed its lawful authority to mark 
„caution‟ with respect to remaining exempted plots of the Petitioner. The 
Petitioner has denied the existence of any dispute with DHA. Conversely, 
the nature of alleged dispute asserted by DHA has two dimensions; (i) 
pendency of civil suit for partition; and (ii) land conveyed to DHA with 
reference to Khasra Nos. is different from land in possession of DHA. In 
this respect, it is suffice to hold that the rights to hold land are vested with 
DHA on the basis of conveyance deeds which are intact. After such deeds, 
DHA as owner has stepped into the shoes of the vendors including the 
Petitioner and there is no bar upon the DHA to participate in the pending 

6 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 8273 / 2024 
suit for partition as per its entitlement in accordance with law. Further, 
there is also no impediment for DHA to avail appropriate remedy against 
the vendors / Petitioner in case of any alleged breach of contract. However, 
it cannot take any unilateral coercive measure in its capacity as a Regulator 
of DHA to mark „caution‟ on the remaining plots of the Petitioner, thus, 
compelling the latter to file a civil suit when the Petitioner does not 
acknowledge the existence of any dispute with DHA.  
7.  
Learned counsel for the Respondents was repeatedly confronted to 
point out any provision of law which authorizes DHA to mark „caution‟ 
with respect to exempted plots received as consideration against sale deed 
noted above which is admittedly still intact in which the land conveyed has 
been duly identified and possession thereof was taken over by DHA. 
However, learned counsel for the Respondents failed to point out any such 
provision of law which was invoked by DHA to mark „caution‟ on the 
remaining exempted plots of the Petitioner.  
8.  
The case titled, “Raja Haroon Rashid v. Defence Housing Authority 
through Secretary” (2017 CLC 342) is squarely relevant to address the 
query in hand. The paragraph Nos. 13 to 16 thereof are reproduced as 
under for ready reference:- 
“13. In the case in hand, respondent marked caution on the plot of 
the petitioner on the pretext that he did not fulfill his obligation in 
furtherance of an agreement/conveyance deed arrived at between 
the parties. In case such an obligation was not fulfilled, respondent 
had alternate efficacious remedies available to them under the law, 
by way of approaching the Civil Court of competent jurisdiction for 
enforcement/ specific performance of the agreement/conveyance 
deed or else seek damages from the petitioner. For reference, 
reliance can be placed upon Messrs Malik and Haq and another v. 
Muhammad Shamsul Islam Choudhry and 2 others [PLD 1961 SC 
531], Mst. Rasheeda Begum and others v. Muhammad Yousaf and 
others [2002 SCMR 1089], Muhammad Ibrahim and 44 others v. 
Fateh Ali and 30 others [2005 SCMR 1061] and Ghulam Hussain 
and others v. Muhammad Yousaf and another [PLD 1981 Lahore 
11]. In addition to the above, respondent could have obtained an 
attachment or a stay order from the Court as contemplated in 
Orders XXXVIII and XXXIX, C.P.C. whereafter, petitioner could 
have been restrained from using his plot. 
14. Non fulfillment of a contractual obligation by no means invest 
the respondent-authority to mark caution/place embargo on the 

7 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 8273 / 2024 
rights of the petitioner from acquiring, using and holding a 
property. In the case in hand, instead of approaching the Court of 
Law for enforcement of their rights, respondent in a Kingly manner 
and without any authority of law placed a rider on the rights of the 
petitioner which is in utter violation of Articles 23 and 24 of the 
Constitution, therefore, is not sustainable. 
15. Even otherwise, the marking of caution is also violative of 
Article 10-A of the Constitution as neither any adjudication was 
made by a court of law which would suggest that petitioner has not 
fulfilled his obligation as enshrined in the agreement/conveyance 
deed nor an opportunity of hearing was provided to him prior to 
taking such action which militate the principle of audi alteram 
partem. 
16. It shall not be out of place to mention here that respondent is 
governed by Defence Housing Authority Lahore Order, 2002. A 
perusal of the said law would also suggest that respondent is not 
invested with any authority under the law to mark caution on the 
rights of a land owner.” 
9.  
It, therefore, follows that the act of marking „caution‟ on the 
remaining exempted plots of the Petitioner was in gross violation of 
Articles 23 & 24 of the Constitution which guarantee a fundamental right 
to every citizen to acquire, hold and dispose of property in any part of 
Pakistan subject to the Constitution and any reasonable restriction imposed 
by law in public interest; and that no person shall be deprived of his 
property save in accordance with law. Therefore, after purchase of 
property of the Petitioner by DHA, the latter became exclusive owner of 
land conveyed therein and as such, it has every right to defend the alleged 
pending suit for partition to protect its rights under the sale deed executed 
in its favour by the Petitioner. Mere pendency of such a suit is no ground 
to mark „caution‟ on the remaining exempted plots of the Petitioner. 
Further, if there is any further grievance of DHA with respect to breach of 
obligations by the Petitioner pursuant to the sale deed executed by him, the 
Respondents are free to avail appropriate remedies available to them under 
the law to safeguard their interest. However, DHA in its capacity as a 
Regulator cannot transgress its authority by marking „caution‟ on its own 
regarding the remaining exempted plots of the Petitioner.  

8 
 
 
 
 
W. P. No. 8273 / 2024 
10.  
In view of the above, this Petition is allowed; the impugned Order 
dated 11.07.2023 is set aside; the act of marking „caution‟ on the 
remaining exempted plots of the Petitioner is declared to be without any 
lawful authority; and in consequence thereof, DHA is directed to remove 
„caution‟ and issue NDCs to the Petitioner with respect to its remaining 
exempted plots.
