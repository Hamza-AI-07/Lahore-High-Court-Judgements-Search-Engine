petitioner. 
 
 
 
Mr. Muhammad Mansoor Ali Sial, Assistant 
Attorney General for Pakistan. 
 
 
 
Mian 
Shafiq 
Ahmed, 
Advocate 
for 
the 
complainant. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The petitioner has invoked the constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court for issuance of a direction 
to respondents No.2 and 3 to remove her 
husband’s name from the blacklist so that he may 
be able to renew his passport and return to Pakistan 
to face trial in the criminal case registered against 
him.   
 
 
 2. 
The petitioner is wife of Shahid Mahmood 
against whom a case FIR No.347 dated 11.06.2018 
under section 22 of Emigration Ordinance, 1979 at 
Police Station FIA, Faisalabad was registered for 
having received an amount of Rs.7,960,438/- and 
five passports for sending the complainant, his two 
relatives 
and 
two 
friends 
to 
Canada 
for 
employment purpose but did not fulfill his 
commitment.  During pendency of trial of the said 
criminal case, husband of the petitioner left 
Pakistan and his name was placed in the blacklist, 
hence, this petition. 
 
 
 3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends 
that period of passport of the petitioner’s husband 
has expired on 11.10.2021 and he is in urgent need 
of renewal of his passport.  Maintains that the 

2 
 
     W.P.No.33181 of 2023 
 
 
 
petitioner’s husband wants to face trial in the case 
registered against him and in case his name is not 
removed from the blacklist he will suffer an 
irreparable loss.  Further contends that the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 guarantees protection of life, liberty and 
fundamental rights of every citizen but the same 
have been denied to the petitioner’s husband. 
 
 
 4. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer as well as 
learned counsel for the complainant contends that 
name of the petitioner’s husband has rightly been 
placed in the blacklist as he is fugitive from law.  
Further contends that there is an apprehension that 
after removal of his name and renewal of passport 
the petitioner’s husband would again proceed 
abroad. 
 
 
 5. 
Heard.  Record perused. 
 
 
 6. 
The name of petitioner’s husband has been 
placed in the blacklist for having been involved in 
a criminal case under section 22 of Emigration 
Ordinance, 1979.  Clause 51 of the Passport & 
Visa Manual, 2006 provides procedure for 
blacklisting, which is reproduced hereunder: - 
 
 
 “51. Procedure for blacklisting 
(A) 
If any Passport Issuing Authority finds 
that a certain citizen of Pakistan is fit to 
be blacklisted for passport facilities, it 
would refer the matter to the Director 
General, Immigration and Passports 
giving such person‟s full particulars and 
reasons for his blacklisting.  The 
Director General, Immigration and 
Passports will obtain the orders of the 
Ministry of Interior in the matter, where 
necessary. 
(B) 
Federal Government is vested with 
powers to regulate the departure from 
Pakistan and visit abroad of its citizens 
under the provisions of “Passport Act, 
1974” and “The Exit from Pakistan 
(Control) Ordinance, 1981.” In order to 

3 
 
     W.P.No.33181 of 2023 
 
 
 
check the exit of individuals from 
Pakistan, Black List / Exit Control List 
are maintained.  The inclusion into and 
deletion from Exit Control List is the sole 
prerogative of the Ministry of interior.  
Brief description of Black List categories 
„A‟ & „B‟ is as under: - 
(i) 
Category ‘A’: 
Under 
this 
category the names of those 
persons are placed who are 
believed to be involved in anti 
State activities or whose visit to 
foreign countries is considered 
to be prejudicial to the State 
interest, or, whose visit abroad 
is banned from security point of 
view.  The names in this list are 
included or removed by the 
Ministry of Interior. 
(ii) 
Category ‘B’:   Under 
this 
category the names of those 
persons are placed who are 
involved 
in 
the 
offences 
punishable under section 6 of 
the Passport Act 1974 or those 
who were refused passport 
under Para 21 of Passport & 
Visa Manual.  The names of 
persons are also included in 
this 
list 
on 
the 
recommendations 
of 
government 
agencies 
/ 
departments as well as those 
who are deported / repatriated 
from 
abroad. 
 
Director 
General, 
Immigration 
and 
Passports is competent to place 
and remove names in this list. 
(C) 
Normal period of retaining a person on 
the blacklist is five years.  However, a 
person can be kept on blacklist even 
beyond five years provided the referring 
department recommends for further 
retention having full justification in this 
regard.  The competent authority viz 
Additional Secretary, Ministry of Interior 
in case of category „A‟ and Director 
General, Immigration and Passports in 
case of category „B‟ may consider 
deletion of any person from such list on 
his appeal even before the normal period 
of five years.  Both the blacklist 
categories „A‟ & „B‟ are subject to 
periodical review in consultation with 
the relevant agency / department on 

4 
 
     W.P.No.33181 of 2023 
 
 
 
whose instance the individual was 
blacklisted. 
(D) 
The above lists reviewed periodically by 
the Review Committees category „A‟ & 
„B‟.” 
   
 
 
The perusal of above provisions of law clearly 
manifests that the same can only be invoked if any 
citizen of Pakistan wants to leave the country but 
this is not the case in the matter in hand where the 
petitioner’s husband is desirous of entering 
Pakistan. 
Additionally, 
the 
aforementioned 
authority is subject to certain conditions and 
proceedings which have not been pleaded to have 
been satisfied in this case.  Even otherwise, it is 
quite astonishing that on one hand name of the 
petitioner’s husband has been placed in the 
blacklist due to his involvement in a criminal case 
who left Pakistan to avoid trial in the said case 
whereas on the other hand his entry in Pakistan has 
been refused.    
 
 
 
 7. 
Article 4 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 guarantees that it is 
inalienable right of every citizen to enjoy the 
protection of law and to be treated in accordance 
with law whereas Article 9 ibid assures that no 
person be deprived of life or liberty except in 
accordance with law and Article 15 ibid gives 
every citizen the right to remain in, enter and move 
freely throughout Pakistan and to reside and settle 
in any part thereof subject to any reasonable 
restriction imposed by law in the public interest. 
 
 
 8. 
There is no cavil with the proposition that 
being a fugitive from law, the accused loses some 
of his rights such as right to audience as well as 
right to have an Advocate to defend him, as held in 
the case of Hayat Bakhsh and others vs. The State 

5 
 
     W.P.No.33181 of 2023 
 
 
 
(PLD 1981 Supreme Court 265).  However, loss 
of such rights is till such time the accused 
surrenders himself before the Court, as held in the 
case of “Lahore High Court Bar Association and 
others vs. General (Retd.) Pervez Musharraf and 
others (2019 SCMR 1029).  The right to return to 
the homeland to surrender before the Court or the 
concerned law enforcement agency to face 
proceedings in accordance with law is something a 
citizen is not deprived of owing to his 
abscondance.  Reliance in this regard is placed on 
the case of Pakistan Muslim League (N) through 
Khawaja Muhammad Asif, M.N.A. and others vs. 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry 
of Interior and others (PLD 2007 Supreme Court 
642).    
 
 
 
 9. 
In the circumstances mentioned above, name 
of petitioner’s husband has wrongly been placed in 
the blacklist, which is accordingly ordered to be 
removed.  However, since the petitioner’s husband 
is involved in a criminal case for allegedly having 
fraudulently received a huge amount for sending 
the complainant and others abroad, therefore, he 
has to face trial in the same.  This issue seeks 
resolution from Clause 33 of the Passport and Visa 
Manual 2006, which is reproduced hereunder for 
ready reference:- 
 
  
 
“33. 
Emergency Passport for repatriation 
from abroad. 
 
 
 
(1) 
Single sheet emergency passports 
valid only for return to Pakistan, withholding 
the passport of such persons, may be issued by 
Pakistan Missions abroad to:- 
 
 
 
 
(a) 
Undesirable 
Pakistan 
nationals 
residing 
abroad, 
such as forgers/racketeers in 

6 
 
     W.P.No.33181 of 2023 
 
 
 
passports, 
smugglers, 
and 
human traffickers etc. 
 
 
 
(b) 
Persons who fall destitute 
abroad. 
 
 
 
(c) 
Persons to be deported by 
foreign governments. 
 
 
 
 
An emergency passport is meant only 
to enable its holder to return to 
Pakistan.  In no circumstances should 
it be endorsed for any other country. 
 
 
 
 
(2) 
In 
cases 
where 
verification 
of 
Pakistan nationality is necessary before the 
repatriation 
of 
the 
above 
mentioned 
individuals, references for this purpose should 
be made by the concerned Pakistan Mission 
abroad direct to the District Police Officer of 
the districts in Pakistan, to which they belong 
and copies of such references should be 
endorsed to the Ministry of Interior, the 
Director General, Immigration and Passports 
and the concerned Provincial Government.  
The District Police Officer will similarly send 
verification reports direct to the referring 
missions endorsing copies of the same to the 
above mentioned authorities.  The District 
Police Officer will, however, refer doubtful 
cases to the Director General, Immigration 
and Passports, under intimation to all 
concerned for decision.  The latter will take a 
decision in the matter where necessary in 
consultation with the Ministry of Interior and 
convey it to the missions concerned, under 
intimation to the Ministry of Interior, the 
Provincial Government and the District Police 
Officer concerned.

 10. 
For the foregoing reasons, respondents are 
directed to issue single sheet emergency passport 
to the petitioner’s husband for fifteen days only 
under Clause 33 of Passport and Visa Manual 2006 
so that he may be able to return to Pakistan and 
face trial in the criminal case registered against 

7 
 
     W.P.No.33181 of 2023 
 
 
 
him.  With this arrangement, this writ petition 
stands disposed of.
