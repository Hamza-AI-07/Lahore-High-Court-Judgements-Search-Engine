AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J. Through this civil revision, 
the petitioners have assailed the vires of judgment and decree dated 
02.02.2022, whereby, the learned appellate Court while setting-aside 
the judgment and decree of learned trial Court dated 03.06.2021, 
decreed the suit of respondents No.3 & 4.

Facts in brevity are that respondents No.3 & 4/plaintiffs 
(hereinafter referred to as the plaintiffs)  instituted a suit for 
declaration alongwith permanent injunction on 10.09.2016 against 
respondents No.1 & 2/defendants No.1 & 2 and predecessor of 
petitioners/defendant No.3 namely Noora (hereinafter referred to as 
defendant No.3) titled as “Fiaz Ahmad etc. versus Province of the 
Punjab, etc.” by maintaining that they purchased land measuring 05 
kanals 06 marlas  in Khewat No.52 from Afzal son of Yara (herein 
after referred to as the vendor) through registered sale deed No.734/1 
dated 29.12.2003 followed by mutation No.655 dated 30.04.2007; 
that thereafter defendant No.3 in connivance with revenue officials 

C.R. No. 14536 of 2022. 
2
got deducted land measuring 02 kanals 05 marlas  from the above 
said mutation No.655 and alienated in his favour through mutation 
No.799 dated 31.10.2011; that the said mutation is fictitious, result of 
fraud, ineffective upon their rights, without authority and liable to be 
cancelled. No one appeared on behalf of defendants No.1 & 2, 
therefore, ex-parte proceedings were initiated against them. 
Defendant No.3 resisted the suit through filing contested written 
statement by raising certain preliminary objections such as the 
plaintiffs have no cause of action to institute the suit; that they are 
estopped by their words and conduct to institute the suit; that the suit 
is not maintainable in its present form; that they have concealed 
institution of their earlier suit, hence, the instant suit is barred. On 
facts it is contended that he purchased the land measuring 02 kanals 
13 marlas from Muhammad Afzal (vendor) through mutation No.799 
dated 31.10.2011 for a consideration of Rs.50,000/- which was 
inherited to said Muhammad Afzal (vendor) from the legacy of her 
mother namely Fateh widow of Yara through mutation No.798 dated 
31.10.2011; that he is in possession of the land since its purchase and 
the plaintiffs have no concern with the same, however, admitted the 
ownership of the plaintiffs on the basis of registered sale deed and 
prayed for dismissal of the suit with costs. During the pendency of 
suit, defendant No.3 was died and his legal heirs were brought on 
record. Said legal heirs are the present petitioners. The learned trial 
Court, out of divergent pleadings of the parties, framed necessary 
issues and invited them to produce their respective evidence. After 

C.R. No. 14536 of 2022.

recording evidence of the parties pro and contra, oral as well as 
documentary dismissed the suit of the plaintiffs vide judgment and 
decree dated 03.06.2021. Feeling aggrieved, they preferred an appeal 
which was allowed by the learned appellate Court vide impugned 
judgment and decree dated 02.02.2022. Being dis-satisfied, the 
petitioners filed the instant civil revision.  
3.            I have heard learned counsel for the parties at full length 
and perused the record with their able assistance. 
4. 
 
The contention of the plaintiffs is that they purchased 
the land measuring 05 kanals 06 marlas from one Muhammad Afzal 
(vendor) vide registered sale deed No.734/1 dated 29.12.2003 
(Exh.P-1) followed by mutation No.655 dated 30.04.2007 (mark-C). 
It is further contended that in the year 2011 the Halqa Patwari 
deducted 02 kanals 05 marlas land purchased through above referred 
sale deed and the same land was got alienated in the name of 
defendant No.3 (predecessor of the petitioners) through mutation 
No.799 dated 31.10.2011 fictitiously/fraudulently. On the other hand, 
the version of defendant No.3 (predecessor of the petitioners) is that 
the vendor Muhammad Afzal inherited land measuring 02 kanals 13 
marla from his mother namely Fateh Bibi in the year 2011 and in 
this regard inheritance mutation No.798 was attested/sanctioned on 
31.10.2011 (Exh.D-1) and thereafter he purchased the said inherited 
share of vendor Muhammad Afzal for a consideration of Rs.50,000/- 
through mutation No.799 dated 31.10.2011 (Exh.D-2).

In order to prove their version, the plaintiffs produced 
Faiz Ahmad (respondent No.3/one of the plaintiffs) as PW-1. He 
deposed that they purchased land measuring 05 kanals 06 marlas  
from Muhammad Afzal son of Yara; that Patwari Halqa issued Ferd 
Malikiat, on 25.12.2003 after perusing the record, upon the basis of 
which registered sale deed No.734/1 dated 29.12.2003 (Exh.P-1) was 
attested by the sub-Registrar; that on the basis of said registered sale 
deed, mutation No.655 dated 30.04.2007 (Mark-C) was sanctioned; 
that in the year 2011 the Halqa Patwari deducted 02 kanals 05 
marlas  land and entered the same in the name of Noora son of 
Alawala (defendant No.3); that the possession of the disputed 
property is with them. During cross examination he denied the 
suggestion that vide inheritance mutation No.798 dated 31.10.2011 
land measuring 02 kanals 13 marlas was inherited to Muhammad 
Afzal however, he admitted that Muhammad Afzal sold inherited 
land to Noora (defendant No.3) through mutation No.799 dated 
31.10.2011. Amjad Abbas (respondent No.4/the second plaintiff) 
appeared as PW-3 and deposed in the same lines. During cross 
examination he also admitted that Noora (defendant No.3) purchased 
land measuring 02 kanals 13 marlas from Muhammad Afzal which 
was inherited to the vendor from the legacy of his mother Fateh Bibi. 
The plaintiffs also produced copy of registered sale deed No.734/1 as 
Exh.P-1, copy of mutation No.799 as Mark-A, copy of mutation 
No.798 as Mark-B, copy of mutation No.655 as mark-C and copy of 
Khasra Girdwari as Mark-D.

In rebuttal, Sajjad Ahmad son of Noora (defendant No.3) 
one of the petitioners, appeared as DW-1 and deposed that his 
deceased father Noora purchased land measuring 02 kanals 13 
marlas  from Muhammad Afzal for a consideration of Rs.50,000/-; 
that said Muhammad Afzal got inherited the said land from the 
legacy of his mother through mutation No.798 dated 31.10.2011; that 
they are in possession of the same and the plaintiffs have no concern 
with the same. During cross examination he admitted that 
Muhammad Afzal sold his land measuring 05 kanals 06 marlas  to 
the plaintiffs through registered sale deed No.734/1 dated 29.12.2003 
and thereafter on the basis of said registered sale deed the mutation 
No.655 dated 30.04.2007 was sanctioned. He also admitted that said 
Muhammad Afzal also delivered the possession of said land to the 
plaintiffs who are in possession and are cultivating the same. He 
further admitted that the above said land sold to the plaintiffs was 
also owned by Muhammad Afzal. He further deposed that Patwari 
has not deducted any land from the land of the plaintiffs and that if 
there is any wrong entry made in the revenue record, they have no 
concern with it. He also admitted that the suit of the plaintiffs to the 
extent of land measuring 05 kanals 06 marlas  is correct and they 
have no objection if the same is decreed in their favour to the extent 
of land measuring 05 kanals 06 marlas. Amir Bakhsh son of Kameer 
Khan appeared as DW-2 and also deposed in the same lines. He 
admitted during cross examination that plaintiffs purchased land 
measuring 05 kanals 06 marlas from Muhammad Afzal son of Yara 

C.R. No. 14536 of 2022.

through sale deed No.734/1 dated 29.12.2003 and they are in 
possession and are cultivating the same. He also admitted that suit of 
the plaintiffs to the extent of land measuring 05 kanals 06 marlas  is 
correct and they have no objection if the same is decreed in their 
favour to the extent of above said land. In documentary evidence, 
they produced copy of mutation No.798 as Exh.D-1, copy of 
mutation No.799 as Exh.D-2, copy of khasra girdwari as Exh.D-3 
and copy of jamabandi as Exh.D-4. 
7. 
 
From scanning the whole record it appears that the 
plaintiffs purchased land measuring 05 kanals 06 marlas  from 
vendor Muhammad Afzal through registered sale deed No.734/1 
dated 29.12.2003 (Exh.P-1). Without annexing copy of Ferd Milkiat 
with the sale deed, no sale deed could be attested/sanctioned. It 
means that at the time of attestation/sanction of registered sale deed 
No.734/1 on 29.12.2003 copy of Ferd Malikiat with regard to land 
measuring 05 kanals 06 marlas was provided. Perusal of sale deed 
No.734/1 it evinces that the vendor Afzal maintained that according 
to Ferd Milkiat Register Haqdaran Zameen for the years 1997-98 he 
is owner in possession of land measuring 05 kanals 06 marlas 
situated at Khewat No.52, Khatoni No.317, Mauza Kaloka, Tehsil 
Chiniot, which is free from any encumbrance and he delivered the 
possession of said land to the vendees. Said portion of the sale deed 
is reproduced in verbatim as under: -

Thereafter, on the basis of said registered sale deed mutation No.655 
dated 30.04.2007 (Mark-C) was sanctioned and attested. Perusal of 
mutation No.655 (mark-C) it reveals that the concerned Revenue 
Officer sanctioned the same on the basis of registered sale deed 
No.734/1 dated 29.12.2003 (Exh.P-1) and alienated land measuring 
05 kanals 06 marlas from the ownership of the vendor in faovur of 
the vendees (the plaintiffs). In the said mutation (mark-C) a note of 
the Patwari was also available in which he has mentioned that the 
vendor was only owner of 03 kanals 01 marla land which was 
incorporated, whereas, land measuring 02  kanals 05 marlas is in 
excessive. The note of the concerned Patwari is reproduced as 
under:-

In this view of the matter it is very much clear that the plaintiffs 
purchased land measuring 05 kanals 06 marlas through registered 
sale deed No.734/1 dated 29.12.2003 (Exh.P-1)  but at the time of 
sanctioning of mutation No.655 which was going to be sanctioned 
after three years and four months of registered sale deed the vendor 
Muhammad Afzal was remained owner of only 03 kanals 01 marla. 

C.R. No. 14536 of 2022.

Said mutation was sanctioned after three years four months of the 
sale deed. It is also matter of record that the vendor Muhammad 
Afzal got land measuring 02 kanals 13 marlas from the inheritance 
of his mother through mutation No.798 dated 31.10.2011 (Exh.D-1) 
and he alienated the said land to defendant No.3 through oral sale 
mutation No.799 dated 31.10.2011 (Exh.D-2). Now the question 
arises whether the plaintiffs can get compensation from the land 
subsequently acquired to the vendor or not? 
8. 
 
The vendor was under obligation to satisfy the claim of 
the plaintiffs to the extent of land measuring 05 kanals 06 marlas. 
Section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 provides as under: - 
“43.Transfer by unauthorized person who subsequently 
acquires interest in property transferred. Where a person 
fraudulently or erroneously represents that he is authorized 
to transfer certain immovable property and professes to 
transfer such property for consideration, such transfer 
shall at the option of the transferee, operate on any interest 
which the transferor may acquire in such property at any 
time during which the contract of transfer subsists. 
Nothing in this section shall impair the right of transferees 
in good faith for consideration without notice of the 
existence of the said option”. 
 
Provision of this Section comes into play when a person 
“fraudulently” or “erroneously” represents that he is authorized to 
transfer certain immovable property for consideration although not 
so authorized. Such transfer at the option of transferee, operates on 
any interest which the transferor may acquire in such property at any 
time during which the contract of transfer subsists. The erroneous 
representation may be innocent and would also cover a situation 
where the transferor is not even aware of lack of his authority to 
transfer the immoveable property.

The same moot point was discussed and decided by the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled “RAB NAWAZ and 
others vs. MUHAMMAD ALI through Legal Representative” (2007 
SCMR 1120). Facts are that the plaintiffs instituted a suit for 
declaration and sought declaration that they are owners in possession 
of the land measuring 58 kanals 07 marlas by maintaining that they 
had, by a registered sale deed dated 15.12.1976, purchased from the 
defendant land measuring 169 kanals, 16 marlas for a consideration 
of Rs.25,000/-; that later it was found from the revenue record that 
the defendant owned only 87 kanals, 12 marlas and the mutation of 
the sale remained un-attested and in the year 1981 when the 
defendant’s brother, Khurshid, died issueless, from whom the 
defendant inherited the land measuring 58 kanals 07, marlas; that 
after the transfer of this additional land to the defendant, they 
approached the revenue officials seeking transfer in their names, the 
87 kanals, 12 marlas as well as the additional land of 58 kanals, 07 
marlas; that only 87 kanals, 12 marlas, originally owned by the 
defendant at the time of the sale was attested in their favour and the 
additional land inherited by the defendant from his brother was not 
transferred to them on the ground that the defendant had become 
owner of the property subsequent to the sale deed; that the learned 
trial Court decreed the suit and the learned first Appellate Court 
upheld the decree in appeal however, this Court in exercise of 
revisional jurisdiction, set-aside the judgments and decrees of the 
two Courts and dismissed their suit on the ground that the two 

C.R. No. 14536 of 2022. 
10
Courts had misapplied the provision of Section 43 of the Transfer of 
Property Act,1882, as the defendant did not misrepresent the 
quantum of his ownership as his misconception was based upon 
document. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan after discussing 
the facts and circumstances as well as the case-law cited at bar held 
as under: - 
“The defendant was thus, selling 169 kanals out of 218 
kanals, out of which he was entitled to sell only 
87kanals 12 marlas whereas he had no authority to 
sell the remaining 82 kanals 4 marlas. The part of the 
property unauthorizedly sold by the defendant 
included the share of the defendant’s brother Khurshid. 
Thus, the defendant acquired interest in the property 
within the meaning of section 43 of the Transfer of 
Property Act which he had initially no authority to sell. 
The contention of the learned counsel for the 
respondents that the property inherited by the 
defendant from his brother could not be subjected to 
the provision of section 43 of the Transfer of Property 
Act is, therefore, without substance. 
Additionally, equity also favours the appellants, who 
undisputedly had paid the price for 169 kanals, 16 
Marlas of land when he was transferred on 87 Kanals, 
12 Marlas, though even the transfer of the suit-land of 
58 kanals, 7 marlas would also not be sufficient to 
make up the deficiency.” 
 
10. 
 
In this way the vendor was under obligation to first 
satisfy the claim of the plaintiffs and thereafter if some land is left, 
the same be alienated to someone else. But in the instant case, the 
vendor when got the land from the inheritance of his mother, he sold 
it on the same day to defendant No.3 through mutation No.799 dated 
31.10.2011 (Exh.D-2). 
11. 
 
 It is also matter of record that the vendor Muhammad 
Afzal did not challenge the registered sale deed (Exh.P-1) before any 
forum nor there is any record available on the file that he 

C.R. No. 14536 of 2022. 
11
compensated the plaintiffs for the deficiency of the land measuring 
02 kanals 05 marlas. Equity would favour the plaintiffs who have 
paid price for 05 kanals 06 marlas of land while they were 
transferred only 03 kanals 01 marlas land.  
12. 
 
In view of the above, it is established that the plaintiffs 
are owners in possession of the land measuring 05 kanals & 06 
marlas in the joint khata No.59/52 on the strength of registered sale 
deed No.734/1 dated 29.12.2003 and they are entitled to be 
compensated from the property of Muhammad Afzal (vendor) out of 
the subsequent alienations, and, for this purpose the alienations made 
by him after registered sale deed would be liable to make good the 
deficiency. The suit of the plaintiffs is decreed accordingly. 
13. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioners has failed to point 
out any illegality, irregularity, mis-reading, non-reading or 
jurisdictional defect in the impugned judgment of learned appellate 
Court warranting interference by this Court while exercising its 
revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 C.P.C.  
14. 
        Consequently, this civil revision is dismissed in the 
above terms with no order as to costs.
