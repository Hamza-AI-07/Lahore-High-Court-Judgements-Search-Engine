MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant Reference Application under Section 47 of the Sales Tax 
Act, 1990 (“the Act of 1990”), following questions of law, asserted 
to have arisen out of impugned order dated 21.12.2011, passed by 
learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, Lahore (“Appellate 
Tribunal”), have been proposed for our opinion:- 
(i) Whether learned ATIR was justified in setting aside the 
Collector's order by holding that 'reasonable belief mentioned in 
section 40-A of Sales Tax Act, 1990 need to be expressed in 
writing despite the fact that the department had obtained the 
documents from the registered person's premises under section 
38, which does not contain this precondition? 
(ii) Whether learned ATIR was justified in holding the departmental 
action as illegal despite the fact that section 40-A and section 38 
of Sales Tax Act, 1990 are two independent provisions of law 
and any procedural flaw in action u/s 40-A does not 
automatically invalidate a simultaneously taken action under 
section 38? 
(iii) Whether learned ATIR was justified in setting aside the 
collector's order by holding that raid taken under section 40-A is 
procedurally flawed despite the fact that documents seized in the 
raid show blatant violation of Sales Tax Act, 1990 and conform 
the belief of Assistant Collector, which was based on an 
information that he registered person involved in massive e tax 
evasion?

2. 
Brief facts of the case are that pursuant to report of Auditor 
Sales Tax, Bahawalpur regarding involvement of respondent-
taxpayer in sales tax evasion, a team under the supervision of 
Assistant Collector Sales Tax, Bahawalpur visited the premises of 
respondent-taxpayer and took into custody certain record / 
documents purportedly exercising jurisdiction in terms of Section 
38 & 40-A of the Act of 1990. After scrutiny of record, certain 
discrepancies were confronted to respondent-taxpayer through 
show cause notice, which culminated in passing of order-in-original 
dated 05.03.2008, thereby creating demand of sales tax of 
Rs.50,182,350/- along with additional tax / default surcharge and 
penalty. Feeling aggrieved, respondent-taxpayer filed appeal before 
Appellate Tribunal, which was accepted and order-in-original was 
set aside vide order dated 21.12.2011, impugned through instant 
Reference Application.  
3. 
Learned Legal Advisor for applicant-department submits that 
all legal requirements contemplated in Sections 38 & 40-A of the 
Act of 1990 were complied with by preparing and delivering a 
notice to respondent-taxpayer. Adds that order-in-original was 
passed in accordance with law and there is no legal infirmity in the 
same. 
4. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for respondent-taxpayer submits 
that staff of Sales Tax Department along with officials of local law 
enforcing agencies forcibly entered into the office premises of 
respondent-taxpayer, break opened doors and almirahs, impounded 
the record and mal-treated the employees. Argues that record seized 
in an illegal manner cannot be used against respondent-taxpayer. 
Contends that raid, search, seizure of record and subsequent 
proceedings including show cause notice and order-in-original are 
illegal and without lawful authority. He has referred to Collector of 
Customs (Preventive) and 2 others v. Muhammad Mahfooz (PLD 
1991 Supreme Court 630) and Ghulam Hassan  v. Federation of

Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
 Record reveals that a team headed by Assistant Collector 
Sales Tax, Bahawalpur raided the respondent-taxpayer’s business 
premises and took into possession record / documents, which 
formed basis for proceedings culminating in sales tax demand. The 
questions before us are requiring determination as to whether the 
impugned proceedings were conducted in line with spirit of law 
provided in Sections 38 & 40A of the Act of 1990. 
7.  
Section 38 of the Act of 1990 permits an officer authorized 
by the Federal Board of Revenue or the Commissioner Inland 
Revenue to have free access to business or manufacturing premises, 
registered office or any other place whereby any stocks, business 
records or documents required under this Act are kept or 
maintained belonging to any registered person; and such officer 
may, at any time,  inspect the goods, stocks, records, data, 
documents, correspondence, accounts and statements, utility bills, 
bank statements, information regarding nature and sources of funds 
or assets with which his business is financed,  and any other records 
or documents and may take into custody such records, statements, 
diskettes, documents or any part thereof, in original or copies 
thereof in such form as the authorized officer may deem fit against 
a signed receipt. Needless to say that while taking cognizance under 
this provision, inter-alia, the authorized officer must restrict himself 
to the record / documents that are in plain sight or voluntarily made 
available by the person present at the premises, for the purposes of 
inspection and taking into custody. This provision does not 
envisage any authority to compel the production of any record or 
document that is not presented voluntarily. Any record or document 
forcibly taken into custody must not be used adversely against the 
person from whose custody it was taken. The powers under this 
provision, by no stretch of imagination, can compromise the

fundamental rights and constitutional guarantees embedded in the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.  
8. 
Section 40A of the Act of 1990 (since omitted) was to be 
applied only where any Officer of Sales Tax not below the rank of 
an Assistant Collector of Sales Tax has reasons to believe that any 
documents or things which, in the opinion, may be useful for, or 
relevant to, any proceeding under this Act are concealed or kept in 
any place and that there is a danger that they may be removed 
before a search can be effected under section 40, he may, after 
preparing a statement in writing of the ground of his belief for 
which search is to be made, search or cause search to be made in 
his presence, for such documents or things in that place.  
 
We have specifically asked learned Legal Advisor for 
applicant-department to show whether the Assistant Collector had 
prepared a statement in writing of the grounds of belief that there 
was danger that the records or the goods may be removed before 
the search could be effected in terms of section 40, the answer was 
simply in the negative. Admittedly, it is/was not the stance of 
applicant-department that there was any likelihood of elimination 
or taking away the record / documents. Learned Legal Advisor was 
confronted with the provisions of sections 40 and 40A of the Act of 
1990, but he repeatedly referred to the provisions of section 38, 
without explaining as to whether section 38 could be read in 
isolation from the provisions of sections  40 & 40A ibid, relating to 
"searches under warrant" and the "search without warrant". The 
failure to place any material before the Court to establish that there 
were sufficient reasons and grounds for by-passing normal course 
of action specified in section 40 and non-satisfaction of pre-
requisites mentioned in section 40A renders the action taken under 
section 38 unsustainable and consequently the search and seizure 
was illegal, without lawful authority and of no legal effect. 
Apparently, sections 40 & 40A are aimed at to curtail and monitor 
the unlimited and unbridled powers of the Sales Tax Authorities to

avoid undue harassment to the taxpayers. Reference can be made to  
Collector of Sales Tax etc. v. M/s. Food Consults (Pvt.) Ltd. and 
M/s. Diplex Beauty Clinic etc. (PTCL 2006 CL. 441)  and   
Chairman, Central Board of Revenue and others v. M/s. Haq 
Cotton Mills (Pvt.) Ltd., Burewala (PTCL 2008 CL. 116).   
9. 
In view of the above, our answer to the proposed questions is 
in affirmative i.e. against applicant-department and in favour of 
respondent-taxpayer. 
 
This Reference Application is decided against applicant-
department.

Office shall send a copy of this judgment under seal of the 
Court to learned Appellate Tribunal as per Section 47 (5) of the Act
