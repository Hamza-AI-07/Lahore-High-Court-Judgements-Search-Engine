Date of hearing:    09.05.2023. 
Petitioners by: 
Raja Muhammad Riaz Satti, Advocate.  
Respondents by: 
Syed Ali Abbas Sherazi, Advocate. 
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.: Through 
instant petition, petitioners have called into question vires of order 
dated 16.06.2021 and judgment dated 12.11.2021, passed by 
learned Civil Judge and Additional District Judge, Lahore, 
respectively, whereby petitioner No.1’s application under Section 
476 Cr.P.C. for initiation of criminal proceedings against 
respondent No.1 regarding concealment of facts while obtaining 
succession certificate was allowed with certain directions 
concurrently.  
 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondent No.1 applied for 
issuance of succession certificate regarding amount available in the 
bank accounts of deceased Munir Hussain Qureshi. Initially, 
succession certificate dated 03.04.2007 was issued by determining 
shares of petitioners and respondents. Petitioner No.1 filed 
application under Section 476 Cr.P.C., and during proceedings 
learned counsel for the parties orally agreed to surrender the shares 
withdrawn from the bank in pursuance to aforesaid succession 
certificate.  In the first instance, the Court directed petitioner No.1 
to submit record of the amount withdrawn by her from the bank and

Writ Petition No.7073 of 2022 
deposit the same in Court, vide order dated 16.02.2017. Feeling 
aggrieved, petitioner No.1 assailed said order before learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, which remained intact and Writ Petition 
No.81926 of 2017 was also dismissed vide order judgment dated 
04.10.2017. The Hon’ble Supreme Court, vide order dated 
07.05.2019 passed in Civil Petition No.2955-L of 2017,  also 
declined to interfere in the matter and learned Trial Court was 
allowed to proceed as per agreed arrangement between the parties. 
Learned Trial Court, after framing issues, recording evidence and 
hearing arguments from both sides, re-determined the shares by 
including names of other three sisters of the deceased and directed 
the shareholders who received the amounts to return the amount or 
settle amongst all legal heirs according to their shares. Petitioner 
No.1 was also directed to submit double local surety bonds 
according to her respective legal share, vide order dated 
16.06.2021. Feeling aggrieved, petitioners assailed said order in 
Revision Petition before learned Additional District Judge, which 
was dismissed vide judgment dated 12.11.2021. Hence, instant 
petition.  
 
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioners submits that it was clearly 
mentioned in the account opening application that in the event of 
death of either of the account holders, the survivor shall be entitled 
to have the full amount available in the joint account. He contends 
that petitioner No.1 was contributing in the joint account from her 
salary as she was working as Lady Doctor. He further submits that 
learned Courts below have failed to appreciate that respondents 
No.2 to 5 were residuaries and they received amounts much excess 
to their entitlement and petitioners (widow & daughters) have been 
deprived of their lawful shares. He argues that respondents are 
obliged to pay back the amount they had received in excess to their 
entitlement and to deposit the amount received by them in Court as 
agreed between the parties but learned Courts have failed to advert 

3 
Writ Petition No.7073 of 2022 
to this important aspect of the matter, hence, impugned decisions 
are unsustainable in the eye of law.  
 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondents defends the 
impugned decisions.  
 
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
 
6. 
The matter relates to distribution of shares amongst legal 
heirs out of the amount available in the bank accounts of deceased 
Munir Hussain Qureshi i.e. PLS Saving Joint Account No.01-100-
3208-1 (jointly opened with petitioner No.1), in Allied Bank 
Limited, Johar Town, Akbar Chowk, Lahore and a Foreign 
Currency Saving Account No.02-088-0190-5 in the same branch of 
the bank. Petitioner No.1 (widow), petitioners No.2 & 3 
(daughters), respondent No.1 (mother), respondents No.2 to 4 
(brothers), respondent No.5 (sister) and Shaida Sajjad, Saima 
Qamar Aftab & Shaista Ijaz (sisters) are legal heirs of deceased 
Munir Hussain Qureshi. The relationship between the parties is not 
in dispute.  
 
7. 
All moveable and immoveable properties owned and 
possessed by the deceased at the time of death and includes a 
property which is due to the deceased from any other person 
(though not received by the deceased during his life time, but the 
deceased was legally entitled to raise a claim in respect of the same 
in his life time) and distributable among his legal heirs as per their 
respective shares is called Tarka. It is a settled law that the 
succession to the estate of a Muslim under the Muhammadan Law 
shall open the moment a person departs from this world and rest of 
the proceedings are mere formalities. It is his legal heirs, as per the 
Shariah, who are alive at that time, shall be entitled to inherit his 
estate.  
 
8. 
The fact that account opening application / form is bearing 
characteristic of “either or survivor” neither gives any authority 
to the Bank to disburse the available amount to the survivor of 
the joint account holder nor makes the survivor sole owner of the 

4 
Writ Petition No.7073 of 2022 
amount available in joint account. This arrangement also does not 
lend support from Muhammadan Law, especially when the 
Courts below after appreciating the evidence brought on record 
have concurrently observed that it was not established that 
petitioner had any own source of income rather she was 
dependent upon her husband and the joint account was opened in 
the air of confidence for sake of domestic liabilities. Moreover, it 
was not stipulated in the application / form that the survivor was 
unconditionally entitled to withdraw any amount from the said 
account after the death of co-account holder without adopting the 
due process of law. Admittedly, the amount available in the joint 
account was not gifted to petitioner No.1, thus, she retains no title 
over the same. Even otherwise, under the law with the death of 
one of the 
account holders of a joint account 
any 
authorization/authority given by the deceased co-account holder 
stood automatically revoked and even a validly authorized person 
is denuded of such power after death of the principal as all assets 
of the deceased by operation of law stood vested in the ownership 
of legal heirs of the deceased and the Bank or the joint account 
holder are not empowered to unilaterally operate the account or 
withdraw any amount until and unless as per law a declaration 
regarding succession or letter of administration or probate is 
issued by the Court of competent jurisdiction.  
 
 
In outlines of Muhammadan Law by Fyzee (1964 Edition) 
the following commentary exists at page 218 :-  
"Advancement, Joint account.-Where a Muslim died leaving deposits in 
the joint names of himself and his daughter, payable to either or survivor, 
such deposits did not constitute a gift in the nature of advancement to the 
daughter in the absence of proof of specific intention….” 
Even in nomination cases, nominee is not entitled to receive the 
entire amount of deceased. Such nomination would neither be a will 
nor a gift nor a trust. It would merely be a mandate, the validity of 
which would expire with death and the amount available in the 
account would be undisposed estate of the deceased. Such 

5 
Writ Petition No.7073 of 2022 
nomination cannot override the provisions of Islamic Law of 
Inheritance, therefore, no legal heir could be deprived from 
receiving their respective share. Reference can be made to Ch. 
Habibullah v. Sheikhupura Central Cooperative Bank Ltd. (PLD 
1987 Supreme Court 53), Malik Safdar Ali Khan and another v. 
Public-at-Large and others (2004 SCMR 1219), Syed Shah Pir 
Mian Kazmi v. Mst. Nelofer (Widow) and others  (2012 CLD 850) 
and Dubai Islamic Bank Pakistan and others v. Mst. Saima Yasin 
and others (2020 CLD 518). 
9. 
Learned Courts below have rightly appreciated the legal 
perspective of the matter and impugned decisions are supported 
by valid lawful reasons. Learned counsel for petitioners has 
failed to point out any illegality or legal infirmity in the 
concurrent findings of Courts below, hence no interference is 
warranted in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction. 
10. 
In view of the above, instant petition, being devoid of any 
merit, is hereby dismissed.
