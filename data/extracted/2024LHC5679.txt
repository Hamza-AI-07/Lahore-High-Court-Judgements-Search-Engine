19.11.2024 Mr. Shabbir Ahmad Mughal, Advocate, for the 
Petitioner. 
 
Rana Tasawar Ali Khan, Deputy Prosecutor General with 
Dr. Zeeshan Mustafa/Consultant Pathology (PFSA) and 
Imran/SI. 
 
Mian Waris Ali, Advocate, for the Complainant. 
 
 
Through this application, the Petitioner seeks post-arrest 
bail in case FIR No.934/2024 dated 28.03.2024 registered at Police 
Station Saddar Kasur, District Kasur, for offences under sections 302, 
148 & 149 PPC. 
 
2. 
 
The allegation against the Petitioner is that on 
26.03.2024, 
he, 
along 
with his 
co-accused, 
subjected 
the 
Complainant’s son, Umar Farooq, to torture at the dera of Col. Farooq 
Bahadur. They then dragged him to the pool of a tube well located 
there, forcibly pushed him into it, and drowned him. 
3. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
4. 
 
The Petitioner is specifically named in the FIR. PWs 
Muhammad Arshad and Imran have recorded statements under section 
161 Cr.P.C., supporting the prosecution’s case. On 29.03.2024, Dr. 
Muhammad Awais Qarni, Medical Officer at DHQ Hospital, Kasur, 
conducted Umar’s postmortem and confirmed that the cause of death 
was drowning, thereby substantiating the ocular account. 
5. 
 
The diatom test is an effective method for determining 
whether death was caused by drowning. When a person is alive, and 
death occurs due to true drowning, referred to as ante-mortem 
drowning, it means the individual inhaled water while their mouth and 
nose were submerged. During this process, diatoms present in the

water enter the lungs and, through blood circulation, reach the liver or 
other organs as blood continues to flow in the arteries and veins. In 
such cases, both the diatoms in the control water sample and those in 
the deceased’s liver test positive. On the other hand, if the individual 
was already dead before entering the water, the lungs may contain 
diatoms, but the liver will not test positive for diatoms because blood 
circulation ceases after death. In this scenario, diatoms in the control 
water sample test positive, whereas those in the deceased’s liver test 
negative. Modi explains the diatom test as follows:1 
“Finding of diatoms by microscopic examination of tissues like 
brain, liver or bone marrow from the femur or humerus, after acid 
digestion is also helpful in confirming death from drowning. 
Diatoms are a class of tiny unicellular algae of different shapes 
found in fresh or seawater. There are about 15,000 types of 
diatoms of which half are found in fresh water and the rest in 
seawater. They may be fan shaped (stellate), ribbon like and seen 
singly or in groups. They vary in size from 2m-1.0 millimetre, the 
usual size being 10.80m. They have hard siliceous, almost 
indestructible outer covering (frustule) and can pass through the 
alveolar walls of the lungs of a living person to the brain, liver and 
bone marrow.” 
6. 
 
In this case, the Investigating Officer collected control 
water for diatoms and fixatives (10% formalin).   
7. 
 
During Umar’s postmortem, Dr. Muhammad Awais 
Qarni took out portions of the deceased’s heart, lung, kidney, brain, 
and liver. He sealed them in separate jars and sent them to the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (PFSA), for analysis. The PFSA’s 
report dated 11.06.2024 gives the following histopathological 
findings: 
 Histological examination of heart sections reveals patent 
coronaries. The myocardium sections are unremarkable. 
 The lung sections reveal vascular congestion and presence of 
edematous fluid inside alveoli.  
 The sections from liver reveal no pathological changes.  
 The renal sections reveal renal tissue congestion and 
associated hemorrhages inside renal tissue. 
 The brain tissue sections reveal congested blood vessels.

 Cytological examination of specially prepared smears from 
liver for Diatoms is positive and matched with present 
Diatoms in control water.  
Based on the above findings, the Forensic Histopathologist has 
concluded that this is a case of ante-mortem drowning. 
8. 
 
In this case, the ocular account provided by the 
prosecution witnesses is corroborated by both medical evidence and 
the forensic report. Furthermore, the police investigation has 
concluded that the Petitioner committed the alleged offence. 
9. 
 
This application has no merit and is, therefore, dismissed. 
10. 
 
The learned trial court shall decide the case on the basis 
of the evidence adduced before it without being prejudiced with this 
order.
