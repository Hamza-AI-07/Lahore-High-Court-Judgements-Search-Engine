Date of hearing:     18.04.2024. 
Appellant by: 
Ch. Saleem Akhtar Warraich, Advocate.  
Respondent by: 
Syed Tariq-ur-Rehman Hashmi, Advocate.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant appeal, appellant has assailed vires of order dated 
02.08.2023, passed by learned Judge Banking Court-I, Multan, 
Camp at Vehari, whereby appellant’s application under Section 47 
read with Sections 151/152 CPC and Section 19(7) of the Financial 
Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance (“FIO”), 2001, 
praying for revisiting of judgment & decree dated 03.03.2020, was 
dismissed.

During execution proceedings, appellant moved application 
under Section 47 read with Sections 151/152 CPC and Section 
19(7) of the FIO, 2001, for revisiting the judgment & decree dated 
03.03.2020, to the extent of award of cost of funds to the 
respondent / customer. Learned Judge Banking Court, after hearing 
arguments of learned counsel for the parties, proceeded to dismiss 
the aforesaid application vide order dated 02.08.2023. Hence, 
instant appeal.  
3. 
Learned counsel for appellant-bank submits that impugned 
order regarding award of cost of funds is against facts, law and 
judgments of Hon’ble superior Courts on the subject. He adds that 
learned Executing Court did not take into consideration the 
objections raised by the appellant in the objection petition, 
therefore, impugned order is unsustainable in the eye of law. In 
support, he has relied upon Ahmad Abbas v. Additional District 
Judge and others (2022 CLC 1296).  
4. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for respondent defends the 
impugned order by contending that learned counsel for appellant-
bank failed to pinpoint any illegality therein. He adds that the 
judgment & decree dated 03.03.2020, passed in respondent’s favour 
has also attained finality, therefore, same is executable.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
Record shows that initially appellant-bank instituted suit for 
recovery against respondent, which was dismissed vide order dated 
07.11.2012 for the reason that excess amount of Rs. 4,73,945.21 
belonging to respondent was lying with appellant, which order 
attained finality. Later on, respondent filed suit for recovery of said 
amount i.e. Rs. 4,73,945.21 with the contention that since the 
appellant-bank itself received mark-up of more than 13.50% from 
respondent, therefore, he is also entitled to receive profit on the 
aforesaid amount lying with appellant-bank. Ultimately, decree for 
recovery of aforesaid amount along with costs and cost of funds 
was passed in favour of respondent.

7. 
Cost of funds is basically the cost that a financial 
institution is entitled to recover from the borrower on account of 
funds which as per the terms of the ‘Finance’ or the law ought to 
have been in the custody of a financial institution but happened to 
be in the custody of the customer after default on the rationale 
that the financial institution has been deprived from placing the 
funds somewhere else for its financial benefit which is the core 
business of a financial institution. Section 3(2) of the Ordinance 
stipulates that where a customer defaults in the discharge of his 
obligation, he is liable to pay for the period from the date of his 
default till realization of the cost of funds of the financial 
institution as certified by the State Bank of Pakistan from time to 
time. Section 3(3) of the Ordinance further states that a judgment 
against the customer under this Ordinance shall mean that he is in 
default of his duty to fulfill his obligation and the ensuing decree 
shall provide for payment of the cost of funds. Since cost of 
funds is attached to the provisions of funds, therefore, cost of 
funds is not awarded to a customer even where a customer 
establishes a breach of obligation on the part of the financial 
institution. Cost of funds is granted only to a financial institution 
on the principle that funds are only provided by a financial 
institution and not by a customer. Section 17 of the Ordinance 
provides that the final decree shall be passed by the Banking 
Court with respect to payment from the date of default of the 
amounts determined to be payable on account of default in 
fulfillment of the obligation and for costs including in the case of 
a suit filed by a financial institution cost of funds determined 
under section 3 of the Ordinance. Banking Court under the 
provisions of Section 3(2) of the FIO, 2001 is empowered to 
award cost of funds in favour of financial institutions and such 
privilege or benefit had not been conferred by statute to the 
customer. This interpretation is also supported by the Latin Legal 
Maxims used in legal interpretation (i) Expressio unius personae 

 
 
EFA No.41 of 2023 
 
4
vel rei, est exclusio alterius – The express mention of one person or 
thing is the exclusion of another and (ii) Expressum facit cessare 
tacitum – What is expressed makes what is silent to cease. This 
view is further supported by the principle of Casus Omissus. In 
Deputy Director Finance and Administration Fata through 
Additional Chief Secretary FATA, Peshawar and others v. Dr. 
Lal Marjan and others (2022 SCMR 566), the Supreme Court 
while discussing the scope of principle of Casus Omissus held 
that the said principle provides that, where the legislature has not 
provided something in the language of the law, the Court cannot 
travel beyond its jurisdiction and read something into the law as 
the same would be ultra vires the powers available to the Court 
under the Constitution and would constitute an order without 
jurisdiction. 
8. 
In Reference No.01 of 2012 (PLD 2013 Supreme Court 
279) = Nadeem Ahmed Advocate v. Federation of Pakistan (2013 
SCMR 1062), the Supreme Court of Pakistan while explaining the 
principle of Casus Omissus held as follows:-  
“A Casus Omissus can, in no case, be supplied by the 
Court of law as that would amount to altering the provision. 
"It is not our function, as was held by Mr. Justice Walsh, in 
the case of "Attorney General v. Bihari, re  Australia Factors 
Limited (1966) 67 S.R. (N.S.W.) 150; to repair the blunders 
that are to be found in the legislation". They must be 
corrected by the legislator". A Court of law is not entitled to 
read words into the Constitution or an Act of Parliament 
unless clear reason is found within the four corners of either 
of them.” 
 
In Abdul Haq Khan and others  v. Haji Ameerzada and others 
(PLD 2017 Supreme Court 105), the Supreme Court while 
discussing the doctrine of Casus Omissus observed that the Courts 
generally abstained from providing ‘casus omissus’ or omissions in 
a statute, through construction of interpretation. The Court observed 
that the exception to such rule was, when there was a self-evident 
omission in a provision and the purpose of the law as intended by 
the legislature could not otherwise be achieved, or if the literal 

 
 
EFA No.41 of 2023 
 
5
construction of a particular provision led to manifestly absurd or 
anomalous results, which could not have been intended by the 
legislature. The Court further held that such power, however, was to 
be exercised cautiously, rarely and only in exceptional 
circumstances. In The Collector of Sales Tax, Gujranwala and 
others v. Messrs Super Asia Mohammad Din and Sons and others 
(2017 SCMR 1427), the Supreme Court held that principle of 
reading in or ‘casus omissus’ was not to be invoked lightly, rather it 
was to be used sparingly and only when the situation demanded it. 
The Court held that the Courts should refrain from supplying an 
omission in the statute because to do so steered the courts from the 
realms of interpretation or construction into those of legislation.  
9. 
In view of the above, it is concluded that the Banking 
Court has committed gross illegality in dismissing appellant’s 
application filed under Section 47 read with Sections 151/152 CPC 
and Section 19(7) of the FIO, 2001. Further reliance in this regard 
is also placed upon Messrs Long Term Venture Capital 
Modaraba v. Messrs State Life Insurance Corporation of 
Pakistan (2005 CLD 122) and Bank of Punjab through Attorney 
v. Manzoor Qadir and another (2021 CLD 1037).  
10. 
So far as respondent’s argument that judgment & decree 
dated 03.03.2020 has attained finality, is concerned, it suffices to 
say that there is no doubt about the fact that said decree has 
attained finality, but if the Court is satisfied that the decree is 
nullity / void in the eyes of law, or the same has been passed by 
the Court having no jurisdiction or the rights of the decree-holder 
would not be infringed if the decree is refused to be executed or 
the decree has been passed in violation of any provision of law, 
Executing Court under the provisions of Section 47 CPC can 
question executability of decree. There is no cavil to the 
proposition that questions relating to the executability of an order 
or decree can be raised even in execution proceedings and it is 
open to the party against whom it is sought to be executed to 

 
 
EFA No.41 of 2023

show that it is null and void or had been made without 
jurisdiction or that it is incapable of execution. Reliance is placed 
upon Islamic Republic of Pakistan v. Muhammad Saeed (PLD 
1961 Supreme Court 192) and Fakir Abdullah and others v. 
Government of Sindh through Secretary to Government of Sindh, 
Revenue Department, Sindh Secretariat, Karachi and others 
(PLD 2001 Supreme Court 131).  
11. 
Needless to observe that it is not for the Executing Court to 
decide whether the decree passed is legal or illegal or whether it 
is erroneous or not, but it is open to the Executing Court to 
consider whether the decree sought to be executed is void or not. 
Any decree passed by any Court or forum is void if the Court or 
the forum which passed it has no jurisdiction over the subject 
matter. Reference can be made to V. Chinna Lakshmaiah v. 
Samurla Ramaiah and others (AIR 1991 AP 177).  
12. 
In view of the above, instant appeal is allowed. 
Consequently, impugned order dated 02.08.2023 is set aside 
being illegal and without lawful authority. As a result, judgment 
& decree dated 03.03.2020 shall not be executed to the extent of 
award of cost of funds, which stands set aside to this extent.
