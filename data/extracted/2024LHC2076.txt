petitioner. 
Mr. Zafar Iqbal Awan, Additional Advocate General 
with Mehboob, ASI. 
Sardar Basit Khan Baloch, Nazar Aslam and Ms. 
Mehreen Riaz, Advocates for respondent No.3. 
 
           Petitioner being mother through this petition seeks custody of 
her minor son namely, Muhammad Shahzain reportedly in the illegal 
and improper custody of Zain-ul-Abideen (respondent No. 3), father 
of the minor (herein after called as the respondent). 
 
2. 
   Learned counsel for the petitioner states that on a family 
dispute petitioner was expelled from the house by the respondent 
while depriving her from the custody of minor son. In response to rule 
nisi issued, minor present in the Court was claimed to have been with 
the father by the order of learned Guardian Court passed on 
27.04.2024. 
         
           Learned counsel for the petitioner states that petitioner did not 
have information about filing of such petition which was filed on 
27.04.2024 as per record and on the same day custody of minor was 
secured through an ex-parte order of learned Gurdian Court. Further 
states that petitioner is resident of Tehsil Ali Pur, District 
Muzaffargarh whereas Guardian Petition was filed at District 
Bahawalpur. Adds that petitioner is ready to join the proceedings 
before the Guardian Court but minor being in tender age of less than 
two years requires lap of her mother, therefore, interim custody of the 
minor may be regulated in favour of the petitioner, which was 
vehemently opposed by the other side on the ground that petitioner 

           Writ Petition No. 3109-H of 2024                             2 
 
herself had abandoned the custody of minor and left him alone in the 
house of respondent; she is not in touch with him for the last two 
months and minor is happily living with the father; further argued that 
petitioner, though an acclaimed doctor preparing for FCPS, is a 
careless lady with busy schedule of professional duties, therefore, 
cannot take proper care of the minor and custody of minor with the 
father is also not illegal or improper.  
3. 
  The next say of respondent was that matter is pending before 
Guardian Court; therefore, parties may be given opportunity to contest 
interim custody before said court. 
 
4.      Arguments, pro and contra of proponents were heard;  
 
5. 
 The main stay of the respondent was that once the mother 
waived her right to take custody, she is precluded to make a re-
attempt. Right of hizanat of a mother is recognized in Islam as well 
as in law; claim of the respondent being guardian of the minor would 
obviously give way to the right of hizanat till prescribed age of the 
minor under the law. The waiving of her right of hizanat has no 
binding force in the eyes of law and mother cannot be held 
accountable if at one occasion she had given up her right to hizanat 
on any condition. She will retain her right of hizanat when there is no 
disqualification in law of her waiver, therefore, is not disentitled for 
claiming right of hizanat again. Reliance is placed on cases reported 
as “Mst. HASEENA BIBI versus ABDUL HALEEM and others” (PLD 
2024 Supreme Court 291) and “Mst. RAZIA REHMAN versus 
STATION HOUSE OFFICER and others” (PLD 2006 Supreme 
Court 533). 
 
 
6.      It is essential to highlight that there is difference between Walayat 
(Guardianship) and Hizanat (Custody); in Muslim Law, as in almost 
every other system of law, the father is the natural guardian of the 
person and property of his minor child but Islam recognizes the mother 
as having prior right of custody, obvious reason is the nourishment, 
sustenance, patronage and up bringing of a human child so as to make 
him/her a useful human being. Mother keeps a caring instinct, 
therefore, is the suitable person for such task. That was the reason, for 

           Writ Petition No. 3109-H of 2024                             3 
 
custody, the term ‘Hizanat’ has been used. The word “Hizanat” is 
derived from the Arabic word “Hizan” which means ‘lap of the 
mother’, it denotes giving a child to the mother’s lap for caring and 
rearing. Reliance is on case reported as “Miss HINA JILANI, DIRECTOR 
OF A.G.H.S. LEGAL AID CELL Versus SOHAIL BUTT” (PLD 1995 Lahore 
151) 
 
7.      It signifies love, care and affection directly and constantly needed 
by a male child up to the age of seven years and female child till she 
attains puberty. Care, love and affection play a vibrant and vital role 
in developing the nature and character of a person and as such Hizanat 
can safely be termed as a tribute and privilege of a minor assigned and 
vested in the mother. The woman who holds the custody is called 
“Hizana” and she loses the right of hizanat in certain circumstances 
suggested in the law.  
          The Rule of Hizanat of children of tender age under Muslim law 
is based on the following tradition of the Holy Prophet محمد
ﷺ; 
“A woman once applied to the Prophet, saying, ‘O Prophet of God! 
That is my son, the fruit of my womb, cherished in my bosom and 
suckled at my breast, and his father is desirous of taking him away 
from me into his own care; to which the Prophet replied, thou hast a 
right in the child prior to that of thy husband, so long as thou do not 
marry with a stranger”. 
 
The tradition is quoted in Hedaya (2nd Edition, Vols. I-IV, page 138) 
in Chapter XIV of hizanat, or the care of infant children and under 
section “in case of separation, the care of the infant children belongs 
to the wife". It is followed by the comment that; 
 
"A mother is naturally not only more tender, but also better qualified 
to cherish a child during infancy, so that committing the care to her 
is of advantage to the child and Siddeek alluded to this, when he 
addressed Omar on a similar occasion, saying, 'the spittal of the 
mother is better for thy child than honey, O Omar! which was said at 
a time when separation had taken place between Omar and his wife 
the mother of Assim. The latter being then an infant at the breast, 
Omar desirous of taking him from the mother and these words were 
spoken in the presence of many of the companions, none of whom 
contradicted him." 
 
At page 139 under the title "Length of the term of hizanat" it is said; 
 
"The right of hizanat with respect to a male child, appertains to the 
mother, until he becomes independent of it himself that is to say, he 
becomes capable of shifting, eating drinking and performing other 

           Writ Petition No. 3109-H of 2024                             4 
 
natural functions without assistance after which the charge devolves  
upon the father, or next paternal relation. The hizanat with respect to 
a boy, ceases at the end of seven years, as in general a child at that 
age is capable of performing all the necessary offices himself, 
without assistance. But the right of hizanat with respect to a girl, 
appertains to a mother, grand-mother, and so forth, until the first 
appearance of the menstrual discharge, that is to say, until she attains 
the age of puberty, because a girl has occasion to learn such manners 
and accomplishments as are proper to women, to the, teaching of 
which the family relations are most competent, but after that period 
the charge of her properly belongs to the father, because a girl, after 
maturity, requires some person to superintend her conduct, and to 
this the father is most completely qualified." 
 
Reliance is on case reported as “RAHIMULLAH CHOUDHURY versus MRS. 
Sayeda HELALI BEGUM AND OTHERS” (1974 SCMR 305) 
 
8.       In case of conflicting views expressed in text books on Muslim 
Law, such as Hedaya, Fatawai-i-Alamgiri, Radd-ul-Mukhtar, 
Muhammadan Law by Sayyed Amir Ali, etc., how are the Courts to 
determine which view is correct? " The answer given by the Bench is 
that where there is no Quranic or Traditional Text or an Ijma' on a 
point of law, and if there be a difference of views between A'imma and 
Faqihs, a Court may form its own opinion on a point of law. Reliance 
is on case reported as “Mst. ZOHRA BEGUM Versus Sh. LATIF AHMAD 
MUNAWWAR” (PLD 1965 (W.P.) Lahore 695). 
 
9. 
Hizanat is regulated through Muslim Personal Law of the parties; 
under the Shia Law mother is entitled to the custody of male child 
until he attains the age of two years and if female child until she attains 
the age of seven years. After the child has attained the above-
mentioned age, the custody belongs to the father. Reliance is placed 
on case reported as “MAHMOODA KHATOON versus Syed ZAINUL 
HASNAIN RIZVI” (PLD 1958 (W.P.) Karachi 150). It has been 
observed under Shafei Law that the mother is entitled to the custody 
of her daughter even after she has attained puberty and until she is 
married. AIR 1941 MADRAS 760.  
 
10.       As per Para 352 of Muhammadan Law, a guiding book, mother 
is entitled to custody of male child until he has completed the age of 
seven years and her female child until she has attained puberty. The 
right continues though she is divorced by the father of the child; 

           Writ Petition No. 3109-H of 2024                             5 
 
reliance is on cases reported as “Mst. QURAT-UL-AIN versus 
STATION HOUSE OFFICER, POLICE STATION SADDAR 
JALALPUR JATTAN, DISTRICT GUJRAT and others” (2024 SCMR 
486) and “Raja MUHAMMAD OWAIS versus Mst. NAZIA JABEEN 
and others” (2022 SCMR 2123). However, if she marries a second 
husband, stranger to child, in which case custody belongs to the father 
but subject to determination by learned Guardian Court. There are 
certain conditions which disqualify females for custody. Para 354 of 
Muhammadan Law says that a female, including the mother, who is 
otherwise entitled to the custody of a child, loses the right of custody 
in the following situations;  
 
             (1)    if she marries a person not related to the child within the 
prohibited degrees (Ss. 260-261), e.g., a stranger but the 
right revives on the dissolution of marriage by death or 
divorce, or,  
 
(2) 
if she goes and resides, during the subsistence of the 
marriage, at a distance from the father’s place of residence; 
or,  
 
 
(3) 
if she is leading an immoral life, as where she is 
 
prostitute, or  
 
 
(4) 
if she neglects to take proper care of the child. 
 
 
11.     The claim of respondent’s counsel (s) that custody of father is 
neither illegal nor improper, therefore, habeas petition is not 
maintainable. There is another way of looking at things; under section 
491 of the Cr.P.C. the High Court exercises two-fold jurisdiction; 
firstly, to direct the production of a person who is illegally detained to 
be brought before the Court so as to set him at liberty and secondly, to 
direct the production of a person so that he be dealt in accordance with 
law. In the latter case, it is not essential that the detention must be by 
use of force; if a person has been confined in a manner not warranted 
by law, in that situation also the Court can issue appropriate direction 
under Section 491, Cr.P.C. This question was considered by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as “Muhammad Rafique v. 
Muhammad Ghafoor” (PLD 1972 Supreme Court 6) wherein it was 
ruled as under; 
 

           Writ Petition No. 3109-H of 2024                             6 
 
"The High Court has two-fold jurisdiction under this section: (i) to 
deal with a person within its appellate criminal jurisdiction according 
to law; and (ii) to set him at liberty if he is illegally or improperly 
detained. The question which falls for determination, however, is that 
if the Court finds that the person brought before it was not being 
illegally or improperly confined or detained what order can be passed 
regarding the custody of that person. 
 
 
   
If the person is a minor, the Court may make over his custody 
to the guardian which will be dealing with him in accordance with 
law, but if the person is major, the only jurisdiction which the Court 
can exercise is to set him at liberty whether illegally or improperly 
detained in public or private custody or not. The Court may “set at 
liberty”, but cannot restore status quo ante against the wishes of the 
person brought before it. Such a course will lead to curtailment of 
liberty for which there is no warrant under section 491 nor can such 
an order be sustained under section 561-A of the Code as it cannot 
be said that allowing a person freedom of movement is an abuse of 
the process of the Court."" 
 
12.         Proceedings under Section 491 of Cr.P.C can be initiated before 
the Sessions Judge or Additional Sessions Judges and before this Court 
if any person is in illegal and improper custody; similar relief can also 
be sought by a party under Article 199 (1)(b)(i) of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 through writ of Habeas Corpus 
when any person is in custody without lawful authority or in unlawful 
manner. This Article is usually applicable on malfeasance, misfeasance 
and nonfeasance of any party with respect to custody of a detenu. 
However, High Court Rules and Orders do not create any difference in 
the format of petition and style of orders in both types of petitions. 
Chapter 4-F, Volume-V of High Court Rules & Orders consists of rules 
framed by the High Court under Section 491(2) of Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898 which regulate the proceedings on petitions under 
Section 491 Cr.P.C. They are as follows;  
PART-F RULES FRAMED UNDER SECTION 491(2) OF THE 
CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, 1898, TO REGULATE 
PROCEDURE IN CASES UNDER SECTION 491.  
 
1. An application for an order under section 491 shall be made on 
an affidavit setting forth the circumstances under which the 
order is sought: Provided that all communications addressed to 
the High Court by a person in the custody of a public officer 
complaining of his detention or the conditions of his detention, 
whether supported by affidavit or not, shall be laid before a 
Judge for orders as applications under this rule.  
 
2. Where the court is of the opinion that a prima facie case for 
granting the application is made out, a rule nisi may be issued 
calling upon the person or persons against whom the order is 

           Writ Petition No. 3109-H of 2024                             7 
 
sought to appear on a day to be named therein to show cause 
why such order should not be made and at the same time to 
produce in Court the body of the person or persons alleged to be 
illegally or improperly detained then and there to be dealt with 
in accordance with law: Provided that if the Court so orders, 
production of the body of the person alleged to be illegally or 
improperly detained may be dispensed with.  
 
3. If the application for an order under clause (a) or (b) of 
subsection (1) of the section alleges that a person is confined 
under such circumstances that the confinement amounts to an 
offence, the Court may, at the time of issuing a rule nisi, also 
issue a search warrant, and the person to whom the warrant is 
directed may search for the person so confined; and such search 
shall be made in accordance therewith, and the person, if found, 
shall be immediately brought before the Court, which shall make 
such order as in the circumstances of the case may seem to be 
proper. 
 
4.  The provisions of sections 43, 75, 77, 79, 82, 83 and 84, 
Criminal Procedure Code, shall, so far as may be, apply to all 
such warrants issued under rule 3. 
 
5.  If the Court issuing a search warrant under rule 3 has reasons to 
believe that the person to whom the warrant has been directed 
may not be able to identify the person confined, the Court may 
order a person named in the warrant to accompany the person to 
whom the warrant is directed, to assist him in the execution of 
the warrant.  
 
6. The writ or the warrant shall be served by the bailiff of the Court 
out of the list prepared by the Registrar in consultation with the 
Deputy Registrar, or by such other person as may be appointed 
by the Judge. Where the application is by or on behalf of a 
security prisoner, the writ will be served on the appropriate 
Government and not on the officer detaining the prisoner. A 
security prisoner means a person who has been detained under 
the orders of the Federal or Provincial Government under a law 
providing for preventive detention.  
 
7. On the return day of such rule or on any day to which the hearing 
thereof may be adjourned, where no cause is shown or where 
cause is shown and disallowed, the Court shall pass an order that 
the person or persons illegally or improperly detained shall be 
set at liberty or delivered to the person entitled to his or their 
custody. Where cause is allowed, the rule shall be discharged.  
 
8. The Court may, if necessary, in disposing of such rule, take 
evidence or direct a Court of Sessions or a Magistrate to take 
evidence. 
 
9. Upon the return and production of the party on whose behalf the 
rule was issued, the custody of the prisoner shall be under the 
control and direction of the Court until the disposal of the rule. 
Pending the hearing, the Court may admit the prisoner to bail or 
remand him to the prison where he is in custody.  
 
10. When a bailiff is deputed by the Court to produce an alleged 
detenu/detenus, the party requiring the production should 
deposit with the Treasurer in advance, an amount equal to the 
calculated expenses for the journeys involved keeping in view 
his grade of pay and the daily allowance admissible to him under 

           Writ Petition No. 3109-H of 2024                             8 
 
the relevant rules. The amount shall be paid to the bailiff after 
sanction by Deputy Registrar (Judl.) before proceeding to his 
destination against a receipt which shall be kept on the file of the 
case.  
 
11. ***01[Omitted].  
 
12. ***01[Omitted].  
 
13. In case the bailiff does not submit his claim within the time 
mentioned in the last rule, the amount or the balance thereof 
should be refunded to the party concerned. In case, however, the 
party fails to claim refund within six weeks, the amount due to 
it be credited to Government under the head  
 
“Major head 1200000, Minor head 1230000 Law 
& Order Receipts, Detailed head 1231000 
Justice, 1231003 Justice-General fees, fines and 
forfeitures (74)” 
 
and the treasury challan showing the credit should be attached 
to the file of the case. *01  
 
14. If the writ is to be executed at State expense, the bailiff should 
be paid his expenses as admissible under the rules.  
 
15. If, at any time, on sufficient ground shown to the satisfaction of 
the Registrar, it is proved that the bailiff submitted an 
exaggerated or incorrect claim or claimed expenses though they 
were met by the party concerned, this should be taken to be a 
misconduct and necessary proceedings against him be initiated 
under the High Court Establishment (Appointment & 
Conditions of Service) Rules, which may result in major penalty 
provided by the relevant rules.  
 
16. To check the tendency to file frivolous habeas corpus petitions, 
the Court may, at its discretion, require the party concerned to 
deposit in advance an amount as fixed by the Court directing the 
issuance of rule nisi to be paid to the detenus as a compensation 
if the petition is found to be frivolous or vexatious. *01” 
 
17. In disposing of any such rule, the Court may, in its discretion, 
make an order for the payment by one side or the other of costs 
of rule. 
 
18. The forms of warrants No.1 and 2 in the Appendix to these rules 
shall be followed. 
 
 
Such rules further clarify that Chapter-4, Part-J of above Volume 
deals with rules for the issue of orders/directions under Articles 199 
and 202 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
and clause 27 of the letter patent. According to Part-1 of Part-J 
referred above, such application shall be governed by rules 1 to 18 of 
Chapter 4-F, Volume-V of High Court Rules and Orders, which 
means rules 1-18 cited above shall also be applicable on habeas 
petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 

           Writ Petition No. 3109-H of 2024                             9 
 
 
13. Keeping in view the above explanation, in appropriate cases 
order for recovery of minor can be issued under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, which is being 
issued in this case accordingly.  
 
14. From the above discussion, it is clear that under the law mother 
has a preferential right for custody of a minor till the prescribed age. 
Even if divorce has become effective between the spouses, mother 
does not lose her right of hizanat except in the situations mentioned 
in Para 354 of Muhammadan Law subject to determination by 
Gurdian Court. Thus, for what has been discussed above, the 
circumstances warrant that minor being of tender age requires the lap 
of mother; therefore, interim custody of minor Muhammad Shahzain 
is regulated in favour of petitioner/mother who shall be bound to 
produce him before the learned Gurdian Court where the proceedings 
are pending and fixed for 15.05.2024. However, this order would be 
subject to final determination by the learned Gurdian Court as to the 
rights of parties for custody and visitation of minor.   
15. Disposed of.
