This consolidated order shall dispose of Writ 
Petition Nos. 68931, 77636, 75257 and 61013 of 
2022 as common questions of facts and law are 
involved. In all the afore-referred petitions, 
question of delimitation of constituency Nos. NA-
131 and NA-132 of National Assembly, District 
Kasur is involved whereas in W.P. No.61013 of 
2022 delimitation of constituency Nos.PP-175 and 
PP-176 for District Kasur is also involved. 
2. 
Main grievance raised by the petitioners in 
the afore referred petitions is that Election 
Commission of Pakistan (E.C.P.) for conducting 
general elections started delimitation proceedings 
for constituencies of National Assembly and 
Provincial Assembly of Punjab, wherein Form-5 
under rule 10(7) of Election Rules, 2017 (‘Rules’) 
i.e. proposed draft for delimitation of constituency 

W.P. No. 68931 of 2022 
                                 2 
 
Nos. NA-131 and NA-132 in District Kasur was 
notified and published by E.C.P., to which 
petitioners and some respondents and applicants in 
the 
connected 
petitions 
raised 
objections 
whereupon extensive hearings have been held at 
Islamabad and objections were decided on 
19.07.2022 
and 
Form-7 
relating 
to 
final 
delimitation of constituencies in terms of rule 14 
was notified by E.C.P. on 5th August, 2022 which 
was also uploaded on their official website, 
however, subsequently respondent No.2 i.e. 
Deputy Director Law of E.C.P. issued two 
impugned corrigenda both dated 12th August, 2012 
whereby delimitation of constituency Nos. NA-131 
and NA-132 of tehsil and District Kasur that had 
been finalized on 5th August, 2022 by majority 
members of E.C.P. was modified. The petitioners 
claim that same was not permissible as E.C.P. by 
issuance of Form-7/final list of constituencies had 
become functus officio and neither the Election 
Commission nor any of its officers could thereafter 
change the final list. Further it is claimed that 
constituency Nos. NA-131 and NA-132 were 
horizontally divided through Form-F7 issued on 
5th August, 2022 whereas through corrigendum 
issued on 12th August, 2022 same was divided 
vertically 
which 
completely 
changed 
the 
compactness 
and 
contiguity 
of 
areas, 
rationalization and demography of population of 
the constituencies and the same could not be done 
by Deputy Director Law of E.C.P. through simple 
corrigendum which act has no backing of law. 
3. 
On the other hand, learned counsel for 
respondents have defended impugned order on the 

W.P. No. 68931 of 2022 
                                 3 
 
ground that some errors had crept in the original 
Form-7 
i.e. 
final 
list 
of 
delimitation 
of 
constituency Nos. NA-131 and NA-132 issued on 
05.08.2022 which were rectified by exercise of 
powers vested under Section 22 of Election Act, 
2017 
(‘Act’) 
resultantly 
corrigendum 
dated 
12.08.2022 was issued by Deputy Director Law of 
E.C.P. which according to them was permissible 
under the law, therefore, it is claimed that 
delimitation of constituency Nos.NA-131 and NA-
132 through Form-7 issued on 5th August, 2022 
had rightly been modified through corrigendum 
dated 12.08.2022. The applicants of applications 
under Order I rule 10 C.P.C. in the connected 
petitions have also been heard in detail, some of 
whom have defended the impugned orders whereas 
others have called the validity of the same in 
question, hence, their grounds and objections have 
also been considered by treating them as parties to 
the petitions.  
4. 
The perusal of the record shows that final 
list of constituencies Form-7 along with maps were 
issued on 5th Aug, 2022 by the E.C.P. which were 
based on two separate decisions by the E.C.P. both 
dated 19.07.2022 passed in two separate groups of 
fifteen petitions each in which the delimitation of 
constituency Nos.NA-131 and NA-132 were 
notified in Form-7 whereby the said constituencies 
were divided horizontally on the basis of order 
dated 19.07.2022 and the relevant operative part of 
paragraph No.18 onwards of one of said orders is 
provided as under: 
“18. 
We have heard the arguments of all the 
learned counsel as well as the petitioners at length 
and have also perused the record and thoroughly 

W.P. No. 68931 of 2022 
                                 4 
 
examined the maps displayed by the petitioners and 
the members of the delimitation committee. Now it 
is to be seen that whether the constituencies have 
been delimited in accordance with Section 20 of 
Election Act, 2017 and Rule 10 of Election Rules, 
2017 and whether the principles and criteria for 
formation/delimitation of constituencies i.e. public 
convenience, communication facilities, compactness 
of areas and breaking of administrative units, have 
been considered and followed by the delimitation 
committee. Keeping in view the above principles in 
mind and after careful perusal of record, the 
decision of the Commission is as under:- 
(National Assembly) 
 
The cases of the petitioners i.e. Mr. Khalid, 
Ahmed Raees, Shabaz Ahmed, Mehr Liaquat Ali 
and Muhammad Arshad at sr. No. 5, 7, 12, 13 and 
14, pertain to NA-131, 132, 137 & 138 of District 
Kasur Having examined all the available material 
and 
record 
we 
have 
observed 
that 
the 
representations filed by the petitioners at sr. 5 & 7 
and proposals offered by them are reasonable and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
delimitation. The delimitation committee has 
overlooked the necessary factors and has erred in 
delimiting the constituencies in question. Therefore, 
the representations filed by the petitioners 5 & 7 
stand accepted. Resultantly, the representations of 
the petitioners at sr. No. 12, 13 and 14, in respect of 
NA-132, to the extent allowed in the cases of the 
petitioners at sr. 5 & 7, also stand to allowed 
partially. The Delimitation Committee is make 
following changes in the constituencies in question 
as proposed by the petitioners 5, 7, 12, 13 and 14 in 
their representations: 
i. 
To restore the old delimitation of NA-137 & 
138 (now proposed as NA-131 & 132) 
carried out in 2018, in vertical shape 
instead of horizontal line, in order to avoid 
bifurcation 
of 
coherent 
population, 
convenience and interconnectivity of the 
voters as well as justified bifurcation of 
urbanized and rural areas. 
ii. 
Qanungo Halqa Khudian be excluded from 
proposed NA-131 and it be restored at its 
previous position. Likewise, TC Khudian 
also be excluded from NA-132 and it be 
restored at its previous position, in order to 
avoid bifurcation of homogeneous. 
iii. 
Ultimately, the following areas shall be 
included in NA-131 & 132:- 
NA-131, 
Kasur 
Kasur Tehsil excluding the following areas 
(i) 
MC Mustafa Abad 
(ii) MC Raja Jang; and

5. 
It has been claimed by counsel for the 
petitioners that the paragraph No.18(a)(iii) of the 
afore-referred order, reproduced above, provides 
the final delimitation of constituency Nos. NA-131 
and NA-132 by specifically mentioning areas 
forming the said constituencies which were also 
notified through Form-7 with corresponding maps 
attached and notified in accordance with law 
having finality attached to the same and the said 
delimitation could not be changed through 
corrigendum issued on 12.08.2022 by the Deputy 
Director Law of E.C.P.  The operative part of the 
corrigenda issued by E.C.P. relating to the afore-
referred two constituencies of National Assembly 
whereby the same were changed from horizontal 
division to vertical division is as under:- 
“CORRIGENDUM 
 
The sub-paragraph (i) appearing at page 20 
of the final order of the Election Commission dated 
19.07.2022, in respect of District Kasur, stand 
omitted on account of inadvertent oversight, 
typographical mistake to the extent of constituencies 
of NA-131 Kasur-1 and NA-132 Kasur-II (in respect 
of missing areas of QH Khudian, TC Khudian and 
Usman Wala) and are substituted with paragraph 
as per following detail:-

6. 
Another corrigendum was also issued on the 
same day and published on the website of the 
E.C.P. with somewhat different areas and 
population of the said constituencies with vertical 
division of the aforesaid constituencies, details of 
which have not been reproduced herein to avoid 

W.P. No. 68931 of 2022 
                                 7 
 
unnecessary details. However, the delimitation 
provided in paragraph No.18(a)(iii) of the order 
dated 19.07.2022 reproduced above has been 
changed by the corrigenda by providing areas 
ultimately forming constituencies Nos.NA-131 and 
NA-132. It is claimed by petitioners that there is 
no order passed by the E.C.P. itself on the basis of 
which corrigenda have been issued whereas the 
counsel for E.C.P. claims that Deputy Director 
Law of E.C.P. has issued the said corrigenda on 
behalf of E.C.P. to rectify the mistakes in earlier 
order.  
7. 
The perusal of the afore-referred orders and 
maps attached with the said order show that there 
appears to be a complete change in constituencies 
in both the said orders where horizontal division in 
order dated 05.08.2022 has been changed to 
vertical division through corrigendum dated 
12.08.2022. The question whether the said 
constituencies have been actually modified or 
corrigendum was issued only by correcting the 
errors that had earlier crept in the said order is not 
clear by bare perusal of the areas mentioned in the 
constituencies, earlier finalized by Form-7 and 
modified by the corrigendum issued thereafter, 
however, discrepancies are apparent from the 
details of areas mentioned in both lists and 
corresponding maps, which maps and list issued on 
05.08.2022 according to representative of E.C.P. 
were not proper depiction of what has actually 
been decided by E.C.P. in its order dated 
19.07.2022. The said discrepancies cannot be 
summarily resolved without deeper appreciation of 
disputed 
facts 
and 
resolution 
of 
actual 

W.P. No. 68931 of 2022 
                                 8 
 
controversies pointed out by the parties which 
even otherwise cannot be done in constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court. Moreover, it is observed 
that before passing order for modification of 
constituencies notice in terms of Section 22(2) of 
the Act has not been issued to the parties which 
had contested the matter before E.C.P. which 
resulted in passing of order dated 19.07.2022, 
hence, the parties in whose favour the said order 
was passed have apparently been condemned 
unheard. 
The 
question 
that 
whether 
first 
delimitation of constituency was correct or not or 
second delimitation of constituencies issued 
through corrigendum related to change of 
constituencies or the same was only providing for 
corrections in terms of order passed by E.C.P. is a 
debatable question and further the question that 
how delimitation of constituencies has been done 
requires deeper appreciation, which may not be 
possible under constitutional jurisdiction of this 
Court and although the petitioners have prayed that 
this Court may pass an appropriate order regarding 
final 
delimitation 
of 
constituencies 
without 
referring the same to the E.C.P., yet this Court, for 
the reason that factual controversy is involved 
which cannot be decided summarily and the matter 
itself cannot be resolved merely on the basis of 
legal grounds raised by the parties, deems it 
appropriate to set aside the orders dated 
19.07.2022, 05.08.2022 and 12.08.2022 relating to 
delimitation of NA-131 and NA-132 only and 
remand the matter to E.C.P. to re-hear the parties 
and 
decide 
the 
matter 
relating 
to 
said 
constituencies afresh on its own merits strictly in 

W.P. No. 68931 of 2022 
                                 9 
 
accordance with law, which exercise shall be 
carried out as expeditiously as possible. 
8. 
As regards Writ Petition No.61013 of 2022 
is concerned, the same besides delimitation of NA-
131 and NA-132 for National Assembly in District 
Kasur also relates to delimitation of constituency 
Nos.PP-175 and PP-176 relating to Provincial 
Assembly of Punjab in District Kasur. The claim 
of learned counsel for the petitioner in the said 
petition is that principles laid down in Section 20 
of the Act have not been kept in consideration 
while issuing Form-7 as the constituency No.PP-
176 has been placed in center of constituency 
No.PP-175 breaking the contiguity of PP-175 
wherein areas alien to the said constituency are 
falling within center of said constituency. The 
counsel for respondents as well as for E.C.P. in the 
said petition have defended the impugned order, 
however, it is observed that in view of Section 20 
of the Act delimitation of constituencies has to be 
made with regard to the distribution of population 
in geographically compact areas, physical features, 
existing boundaries of administrative units, facility 
of communication and public convenience and 
other cognate factors to ensure homogeneity in 
creation of constituencies. In the present case 
constituency Nos. PP-175 and PP-176 had been 
originally proposed to be delimited through Form-
5, which provided for constituency No.PP-176 to 
be at Southern side of constituency No.PP-175 
where-after when final list of delimitation/Form-7 
had been issued, said constituency No.PP-176 falls 
within center of constituency No.PP-175 whereby 
contiguity of constituency No.PP-175 seems to 

W.P. No. 68931 of 2022 
                                 10 
 
have been disrupted, which is apparently not in 
accordance with the principles of delimitation of 
constituencies provided in Section 20 of the Act 
and in these circumstances it would be appropriate 
to set aside final delimitation of constituencies 
through order dated 19.07.2022 and  05.08.2022 to 
the extent of constituency Nos.PP-175 and PP-176 
only and remand the matter to E.C.P. for deciding 
the same afresh after providing proper opportunity 
of hearing to all the parties. 
9. 
With the above observations, all the above 
referred Writ Petitions are allowed in the 
aforementioned terms.
