Asjad Javaid Ghural- J.      Through the afore-titled criminal appeal, 
appellant Muhammad Asharf has challenged the vires of judgment dated 
23.12.2022 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Gujranwala in case 
FIR No.374/21, dated 20.09.2021, P.S. Eminabad, District Gujranwala 
whereby he was convicted and sentenced as under:- 
 
 
Under Section 302(b) PPC 
Imprisonment for life as Ta’zir  and to pay the compensation 
amounting to Rs.3,00,000/- to the legal heirs of deceased Mst. 
Musarat Bibi under Section 544-A Cr.P.C. and in default thereof, to 
further undergo SI for six months.  
 
 
Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended to the convict.  
 
2. 
Faisal Sohail (PW-1)/complainant set the law into motion by filing 
application (Ex.PA) for registration of case before the SHO, P.S. 
Eimanabad, Gujranwala alleging therein that on 31.08.2021 at about 10.00 
a.m. his neighbour Muhammad Nawaz (PW-2) telephonically informed him 
that on hearing the noise from my house, he entered into it and witnessed my 
father (appellant) beating my mother. On this news, he arrived at his house 
and found his mother smeared with blood in unconscious condition. He took 
his mother to Civil Hospital, Gujranwala wherefrom she was referred to 
General Hospital, Lahore. Upon the said application formal FIR (Ex.PD),

was registered against the appellant U/S 324 PPC, however, subsequently on 
the death of the injured, offence U/S 302 PPC was added.  
3. 
After framing of formal charge, recording the prosecution evidence 
and statement of the appellant U/S 342 Cr.P.C. the Trial Court convicted and 
sentenced the appellant as stated above. Hence, this appeal.   
4. 
I have heard learned counsel for the appellant, learned Law Officer 
appearing for the State assisted by learned counsel for the complainant and 
gone through the record.  
5. 
In order to prove the charge against the appellant Faisal Sohail (PW-
1) by appearing in the witness box reiterated the contents of crime report 
(Ex.PD) which itself are indicative of the fact that he was not eye-witness of 
the occurrence and what he stated was based upon hearsay, as such needs no 
further discussion.  
6. 
The only star witness of the occurrence was Muhammad Nawaz (PW-
2), who by appearing in the witness box deposed that on 31.08.2021 he was 
present in his house. On hearing the noise and hue and cry from the house of 
the complainant, who happened to be his neighbour, he went there and saw 
appellant beating Mst. Musarrat Bibi mercilessly with Danda. He 
accordingly informed the complainant about the occurrence. Despite lengthy 
cross-examination the defence could not shatter his credibility on material 
points. He was an independent witness having no nexus with the 
complainant or animus with the appellant. Even the appellant in his 
statement U/S 342 Cr.P.C. did not raise any finger over neutrality of this 
witness. In the absence of any ill will on the part of such independent 
witness to falsely involve the appellant in the case of capital charge, his 
testimony deserves credence. 
7. 
Learned defence counsel mainly argued that the incident has allegedly 
taken place on 31.08.2021 but the matter was reported to the police on 
20.09.2021 i.e. with an unexplained and inordinate delay of twenty days 
which is fatal to the prosecution’s case. Generally setting the law into 
motion with such lethal delay was considered fatal to the prosecution’s case 
but here in the instant case the situation is entirely different. Culprit was the 
real father of the complainant, whereas, victim was his real mother, who was 
battling for her life in the hospital. In such situation, expecting a son to 

Criminal Appeal No.2841-2023

promptly set the law into motion against his father was quite unrealistic. It 
seems that he kept on waiting with a bleak hope of survival of his mother 
and then resolve the issue without resorting to legal action but once the 
police resorted to record the statement of the injured by way of moving 
application (Ex.PP) and the doctor opined that she was not in a position to 
get record her statement, then keeping in view worsened condition of his 
mother, he persuaded to formally lodge the FIR. The shock, fear and 
hesitation arising from accusing one’s own father of such a grave offence 
naturally explain the delay. It is, therefore, held that in cases involving such 
close familial ties, the delay in setting the law into motion, alone cannot cast 
doubt on the credibility of prosecution’s case.  
8. 
Learned counsel further emphasized that the deceased lady was 
survived by one other son and two daughters but none of them came forward 
to speak against the appellant, which raises serious question mark qua 
authenticity of the prosecution story. This submission has no force. In the 
matter of appreciation of the evidence it is not the number of witnesses 
rather quality of evidence is important. There is no requirement under the 
law that a particular number of witnesses are necessary to prove/disprove a 
fact. It is time honoured principle that evidence must be weighed not 
counted. One can easily understand that where the father was accused of 
murdering the mother, the children are placed in an extremely distressing 
and emotionally conflicted position. It cannot be expected that every child 
will have the same strength or willingness to testify against a parent, 
regardless of the circumstances. Fear, trauma, loyalty and psychological 
shock can all influence their conduct. Therefore, mere fact that some 
children did not come forward to depose against their father does not 
weaken the prosecution’s case or undermine the credibility of the 
complainant, who took such a daring step to take his own father to task for 
committing the murder of his mother. Moreso, if the defence was so sure 
that other children were not ready to support the prosecution story, it has 
ample opportunity to examine them in their defence but no such effort was 
made, in the absence whereof, no premium can be extended to the appellant 
on that basis.

9. 
Learned defence counsel stressed that acclaimed eye-witness namely 
Muhammad Nawaz (PW-2) during cross-examination admitted that his 
statement U/S 161 Cr.P.C. was recorded after twenty days, therefore, such 
belated statement lost its evidentiary value. I am not in agreement with the 
submission for the sole reason that as has been discussed supra, the crime 
report was got lodged after twenty days of the occurrence, as such recording 
of the statement of the eye-witness on the same day of the lodging of the 
crime report has no adverse effect qua veracity of prosecution’s case.  
10. 
Dr. Momina Ijaz, (PW-5) had conducted post mortem examination of 
deceased Mst. Musart Shaheen on 13.10.2021 at about 0.13 p.m. and 
observed single injury on the left side of skull 2 cm above the left ear. 
According to her opinion this injury caused massive hemorrhage which 
leads to cardiopulmonary arrest and subsequent death. Probable duration 
between injury and death was roughly two months and between death and 
postmortem six to eight hours.  
Learned defence counsel while referring to the statement of the eye-
witness (PW-2) that he saw appellant mercilessly beating the deceased laid 
much emphasis that observance of single injury on the person of deceased 
by the Medical Officer is sufficient to bely the ocular account. I am not in 
agreement with this submission for more than one reasons. Firstly, 
connotation of mercilessly beating does not ipso facto constitute that all the 
injuries inflicted by the appellant should have been detected by the Medical 
Officer at the time of post mortem examination of the deceased which was 
conducted after two months of the occurrence. The deceased while in injured 
condition remained under treatment for almost two months. There is every 
probability that during the intervening period minor injuries inflicted by the 
appellant would have healed, as such merely due to non-observance of other 
injuries at the time of post mortem examination report of the deceased, it 
cannot be said that the medical evidence is in contradiction to the ocular 
account. Secondly, it is a matter of common observance that sometimes 
witnesses exaggerate the statements in desperation of justice and to 
emphasize on the intensity of their words, therefore, variation if any is not 
sufficient to grant any premium to the appellant. Reliance is placed on case 
reported as “Sher Afzal and another ..Vs.. The State (2025 SCMR 894).”   

Criminal Appeal No.2841-2023 
 
 
5 
 
 
Thirdly, it is well settled by now that in the presence of convincing ocular 
account, single ground of conflict between ocular account and medical 
evidence cannot be made basis for acquittal of an accused. Reliance is 
placed on case reported as “Akbar Saeed ..Vs.. The State and another (2025 
SCMR 935)”. 
 
Learned counsel while referring to admission chart (Ex.PE) argued 
that according to said chart date of admission of the injured in the hospital 
was 21.08.2021 i.e. ten days prior to the alleged occurrence, which raised 
serious question mark qua the mode and manner of the occurrence. This 
submission is repelled. This seems to be a clerical mistake as in the history 
of said chart it was specifically written “assault on 31.08.2021.” When the 
assault was made on 31.08.2021 then admission in the hospital on that basis 
ten days prior to it was not possible.  Moreover, this fact was got clarified by 
the defence itself by putting question to the Medical Officer (PW-5), who 
during cross-examination deposed that “It is correct that according to Ex.PE 
the date of admission of the injured is 21.08.2021. The date 21.08.2021 has 
been mentioned mistakenly and wrongly in Ex.PE.”  
11. 
Appellant was arrested on 30.09.2021 and during investigation he led 
to the recovery of “pawa” (P-2), which was taken into possession vide 
recovery memo (Ex.PL). Admittedly, neither said “pawa’ was stained with 
blood nor sent to the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for 
analysis, in the absence whereof, case property being of same pattern cannot 
be safely connected with the appellant.  
12. 
Neither any motive was set out in the crime report nor any reason was 
explained by the complainant by appearing in the witness box for 
committing the murder of deceased by the appellant, however, it has no 
adverse affect upon the case of the prosecution as the motive is not sina qua 
non for the commission of the offence. There are many instances where the 
crime was committed without any motive, as such lack of motive alone 
cannot be made basis for acquittal of an accused. Reliance is placed on case 
reported as “Hameed Khan alias Hameedai ..Vs.. Ashraf Shah and another 
(2002 SCMR 1155)”, wherein it has been laid down as under:- 
 
“Sometimes atrocious crimes are committed without any motive or for every minor 
motive as such adequacy or weakness of the motive or where motive is alleged but not proved, in 

Criminal Appeal No.2841-2023 
 
 
6 
 
 
such cases it is the duty of the Court to scrutinize the prosecution evidence carefully. If the ocular 
evidence is trustworthy and reliable the motive part becomes immaterial as motive is a guess of 
the complainant who speculates that such motive might have motivated the assailant to commit the 
crime as the real motive is only known to the offender being within his exclusive knowledge. 
Absence of motive or failure to prove the motive would not adversely affect the prosecution case 
if prosecution has proved its case by reliable evidence.”  
  
13. 
Appellant being the father of the complainant was solely charged for 
committing the murder of his own wife. The acclaimed eye-witness by 
appearing in the witness box fully implicated the appellant for committing 
this sad incident. Though the complainant was not the eye-witness of the 
occurrence but he set the law into motion on the basis of what an eye-
witness narrated to him and remained steadfast on it till culmination of the 
trial. In our society a father is traditionally placed on a high pedestal, 
regarded with deep respect, authority and reverence. It cannot be assumed 
that a son would falsely implicate his own father in the murder of his 
mother. No son would ordinarily take such an extreme step unless there were 
compelling reasons or circumstances pointing towards father’s implication. 
Therefore, when a son himself names his father as the perpetrator, it carries a 
strong presumption of truth and cannot be dismissed as a fabrication without 
substantial evidence to the contrary. Here in the instant case, neither the 
appellant in his statement U/S 342 Cr.P.C.  explained any solid reason for 
his false implication by his son qua the murder of his own wife nor he 
produced any evidence in defence or opted to appear as his own witness as 
required U/S 340(2) Cr.P.C. in the absence whereof, keeping in view such 
trustworthy and strong prosecution evidence, I have no hesitation in holding 
that the prosecution has successfully proved the charge against the appellant 
for committing the murder of his own wife, as such the Trial Court was fully 
justified in awarding him conviction and sentence and  no exception can be 
drawn therefrom.  
14. 
Resultantly, instant appeal being devoid of any force stands 
dismissed.
