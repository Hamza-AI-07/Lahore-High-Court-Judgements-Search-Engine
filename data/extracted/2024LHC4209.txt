Tariq Saleem Sheikh. – Through this application, the 
Petitioner seeks pre-arrest bail in case FIR No.2590/2024 dated 
02.07.2024 registered at Police Station Sabzazar, Lahore, for offences 
under sections 23 & 27 of the Drugs Act, 1976 (the “Drugs Act”), 
read with section 27 of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan 
Act, 2012 (the “DRAP Act”).  
2. 
 
The prosecution’s case is that M/s SSI Marketing 
Network (“SSI”) is engaged in the manufacturing, retail, wholesale, 
distribution, and marketing of various cosmetics and skincare 
products through online stores and other traditional business modes. 
On 30.03.2024, at about 11:00 a.m., the Drug Inspector of Allama 
Iqbal 
Town, 
Lahore 
(the 
“Complainant”), 
inspected 
SSI’s 
manufacturing facility in the presence of its CEO, Amir Mahmood 
(the Petitioner), and witnesses. During the inspection, the 
Complainant found five medicated cosmetics for which the Petitioner 
could not produce a valid manufacturing licence under the Drugs Act. 
These products were: Aneeza Gold Beauty Cream (20 grams), Brido 
Luxury Gold Beauty Cream, Bio2You Cream, Clobetasol propionate 
powder (Batch No. MLCL0020123), and Clobetasol propionate 
powder (Batch No. MLCL0060522). The Complainant seized the 
products, collected samples for testing and analysis, and prepared 
Form-4 and Form-5, obtaining the Petitioner’s signature and thumb 
impression. Following the inspection, SSI’s finished goods store was 

Crl.Misc.No.44858-B/2024

sealed for violations of the Drugs Act and the DRAP Act. The Drug 
Testing Laboratory (DTL) subsequently reported that the products 
were unregistered and contained allopathic drugs as active 
ingredients. FIR No.2590/2024, supra, was lodged after the approval 
of the District Quality Control Board. 
3. 
 
The Petitioner’s counsel, Mr. Muhammad Zikariya 
Sheikh, Advocate, contends that Ijaz Ahmad is SSI’s actual 
owner/proprietor. The Petitioner is merely an employee and has no 
concern with the manufacturing process. He performs his duties under 
Ijaz’s direction. Mr. Sheikh relies on an instrument dated 28.04.2023 
to support this contention. 
4. 
 
Mr. Sheikh further argues that the present case falls 
within the ambit of the Pakistan General Cosmetics Act 2023, and that 
the Drug Inspector lacks the authority to inspect business premises 
related to cosmetics or seize any products. He contends that the 
Petitioner has been falsely implicated in this case due to ulterior 
motives. The Petitioner has already joined the investigation and is not 
required by the police for further probe. Therefore, he may be 
admitted to pre-arrest bail. 
5. 
 
The Deputy District Public Prosecutor has vehemently 
opposed this application. She contends that the Petitioner is a partner 
in SSI and liable for all its acts and omissions. She asserts that the 
Petitioner and his co-accused manufactured the seized items without a 
valid licence, and the DTL report has confirmed that the items were 
unregistered. She further argues that the Drug Inspector has 
jurisdiction under section 18 of the Drugs Act to conduct the raid and 
inspect medicated cosmetics to ensure compliance with the Drugs Act 
and the DRAP Act. She has prayed for the dismissal of this bail 
application. 
6. 
 
We have heard the learned counsel and examined the 
record. We first consider whether the Complainant/Drug Inspector 
lawfully conducted the raid at the SSI’s premises.

The Drugs Act is a special law that regulates the import, 
export, manufacture, storage, distribution, and sale of drugs.1 Section 
17 of the Act empowers the Federal or Provincial Government to 
appoint qualified individuals as Federal or Provincial Inspectors 
within designated local limits to enforce the Act. Section 18 outlines 
the powers conferred upon these Inspectors, while section 19 details 
the procedures they must follow when seizing any drug or article 
under section 18.  
8. 
 
Clause (a) of section 18(1) of the Drugs Act authorizes 
the Inspector, with the permission of the licensing authority, to inspect 
any premises where drugs are manufactured (including the plant), the 
manufacturing process, the means used for standardizing and testing 
the drugs, and all relevant records and registers. Clause (b) of section 
18(1) empowers the Inspector to inspect any premises where drugs are 
sold, stocked, exhibited for sale, or distributed, along with the storage 
arrangements and all relevant records and registers. Clause (f) of 
section 18(1) allows the Inspector to seize any drug, materials used in 
its manufacture, and any other articles, such as registers, cash memos, 
invoices, and bills, which he has reason to believe may provide 
evidence of an offence punishable under the Drugs Act, or the rules 
made thereunder. Clause (h) of section 18(1) grants the Inspector the 
authority to lock and seal any factory, laboratory, shop, building, 
storehouse, or godown, or any part thereof, where any drug is being 
manufactured, stored, sold, or exhibited for sale in violation of the 
said Act or the rules. 
9. 
 
In 2012, Parliament enacted the DRAP Act (XXI of 
2012) to establish the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan 
(“DRAP”)2 “to provide for effective coordination and enforcement of 
the Drugs Act and to bring harmony in inter-provincial trade and 
commerce of therapeutic goods, and to regulate, manufacture, import, 
export, storage, distribution, and sale of therapeutic goods.” Section 7 
of the Act describes the DRAP’s powers and functions. Section 27(1) 
                                                 
1 Preamble of the Drugs Act, 1976. 
2 Parliament enacted this Act pursuant to the resolutions under Article 144 of the Constitution passed by the 
Provincial Assesmblies of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh.  

Crl.Misc.No.44858-B/2024

states that the offences shall be such as specified in Schedule-III, and 
section 27(2) provides that the prohibitions specified in Schedule-II 
shall be punishable in accordance with Schedule-III.  
10. 
 
Schedule-V of the DRAP Act outlines the powers of 
Inspectors. Clause (6) of Schedule-V stipulates that the Provincial 
Inspector, upon finding any contravention of the DRAP Act or the 
Drugs Act, shall, unless otherwise directed by the Board, always refer 
the case to the Provincial Quality Control Board3 and seek orders 
regarding the action to be taken in response to such infringements. 
Section 29 states that the Inspector shall take cognizance of offences 
in the manner specified in Schedule-IV.  
11. 
 
The Drugs Act defines the term “drug” in section 3(g) 
and the DRAP Act in section 2(xii) read with Schedule-I. The DRAP 
Act separately defines “medicated cosmetics” in Schedule-I. 
According to it, they include “cosmetics containing drugs and are 
defined as articles containing active drug ingredients intended to be 
rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, or introduced into, or 
otherwise applied to the human body or part thereof for cleansing, 
beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance, and 
articles intended for use as a component of any such articles; except 
that such term shall not include soap.” 
12. 
 
Parliament has also enacted the Pakistan General 
Cosmetics Act, 2023 (XLIII of 2023), to regulate the quality, 
standard, labeling, packing, manufacturing, storage, distribution, and 
sale of general cosmetics. Section 2(j) of the Act defines “general 
cosmetic” to mean “any substance intended to be used to clean, 
improve or change of complexion of skin, hair, nails or teeth and 
include the beauty preparations for make-up, perfume, skin cream, 
skin lotion nail polish, nail paint, soap, shampoo, shaving cream, gel, 
sun care and deodorant also include any article intended for use as a 
component of general cosmetics or any other item declared by the 
                                                 
3 The Punjab Government has framed the Punjab Drugs Rules 2007 while exercising powers under section 44 of the 
Drugs Act. Rule 3 describes the constitution of the Provincial Quality Control Board. Rule 4(1) authorizes the 
PQCB to constitute a committee in a district to be known as the District Quality Control Board. Rule 4(4) states that 
the DQCB shall perform its functions under general supervision and subject to the control of the PQCB.

[Pakistan General Cosmetics Regulatory] Authority for the purposes 
of this Act.” 
13. 
 
Thus, the legal framework distinguishes between 
“medicated cosmetics” and “general cosmetics.” The DRAP Act 
governs the former, while the latter falls under the Act of 2023. There 
is no overlap between these two categories. 
14. 
 
In the present case, the Complainant seized the following 
five medicated cosmetics from the SSI’s premises: (i) Aneeza Gold 
Beauty Cream (20 grams), (ii) Brido Luxury Gold Beauty Cream, 
(iii) Bio2You Cream, (iv) Clobetasol propionate powder (Batch No. 
MLCL0020123), and (v) Clobetasol propionate powder (Batch No. 
MLCL0060522). The DTL found ammoniated mercury4 in two items 
and clobetasol propionate5 in the other three. As adumbrated, the 
Provincial Drug Inspector has the authority to inspect the premises 
where he finds any contravention of the Drugs Act or the DRAP Act. 
The Petitioner’s contention that the raid on SSI’s factory is illegal is 
misconceived and therefore rejected.  
15. 
 
The Petitioner asserts that he is merely an employee of 
SSI and that Ijaz Ahmad is the actual owner of the business. However, 
the public prosecutor disputes this claim, citing the Partnership Deed 
dated 28.04.2023, which states that both individuals entered into a 
partnership to form the firm. She also highlights clause 7 of the deed, 
which specifies that they would share the firm’s profits and losses 
equally. In response, Mr. Sheikh contends that Ijaz Ahmad 
contributed the entire capital of Rs. 5,000,000/- to the firm, while the 
Petitioner’s role was limited to operational services. 
16. 
 
In business law, a partnership is a formal arrangement 
between two or more individuals to operate a business and share its 
profits and liabilities. There are various types of partnerships, each 
defined by the partners’ roles, responsibilities, and liabilities. When 
                                                 
4 Ammoniated mercury is used to treat impetigo, psoriasis, minor skin infections, and other skin disorders. Its 
excessive use may increase the chance of absorption through the skin and the risk of mercury poisoning. 
5 Clobetasol propionate is used on skin to treat eczema and psoriasis. It reduces swelling, redness, itching and rashes 
caused by these skin conditions. It is a type of topical steroid medication.

no fixed period is prescribed for the partnership’s duration, it is 
considered a partnership at will. Conversely, when the partners 
establish a fixed duration for the partnership, it ends upon the 
expiration of that period. If the partners continue the partnership after 
the fixed period has expired, it transitions into a partnership at will.  
17. 
 
A Partnership of Skill and Capital, also known as a 
Partnership of Labour and Capital, is a business arrangement where 
one partner provides the financial capital, and the other contributes 
skill or expertise to manage the business. This mutually beneficial 
structure allows each partner to contribute what they possess in 
abundance. The capitalist partner supplies the necessary funds but 
typically does not engage in daily operations, while the working 
partner manages the business using their skills and knowledge. 
 
18. 
 
The profit-sharing arrangement is based on the 
contributions of both partners and is defined in the partnership 
agreement. Due to their financial risk, the capitalist partner usually 
receives a portion of the profits proportionate to their investment. On 
the other hand, the working partner earns their share based on the 
value of their expertise and labour. These terms vary, and the 
agreement can allocate profits in any way that reflects the 
contributions and roles of the partners. This type of partnership allows 
both parties to focus on their strengths: the capitalist providing 
financial backing and the working partner managing the business. The 
clear division of responsibilities often leads to more efficient 
operations. 
19. 
 
In Pakistan, partnerships are governed by the Partnership 
Act 1932 and, where it is silent, by the Contract Act 1872. Section 4 
of the Partnership Act defines a “partnership” as “the relation between 
persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on 
by all or any of them acting for all.” Consequently, a partnership must 
be formed to conduct a business, which must be legal. “Business” 
encompasses every trade, occupation, and profession6 and is not 
undertaken for personal pleasure. The essential feature of a 
                                                 
6 Clause (b) of section 2 of the Partnership Act, 1932

partnership is the concept of mutual agency, where each partner acts 
as an agent for the others in business matters. In Cox v. Hickman, 
(1860 8 HL Cas 268), Lord Cranworth held that mutual agency is the 
definitive test for determining the existence of a partnership. This 
characteristic allows any partner to manage the partnership on behalf 
of all the others. 
20. 
 
Section 5 of the Partnership Act stipulates that the 
partnership relationship arises from a contract, not status. Section 6 
provides that in determining whether a group constitutes a firm or 
whether an individual is a partner, the actual relationship between the 
parties must be evaluated based on all relevant facts. Explanation 1 
clarifies that sharing profits or gross returns from jointly held property 
does not automatically establish a partnership. Explanation 2 further 
states that receiving a share of business profits or payments linked to 
profits does not make someone a partner by itself. In particular, the 
following payments do not create a partnership: (a) by a lender of 
money to persons engaged in or about to engage in any business,  
(b) by a servant or agent as remuneration, (c) by the widow or child of 
a deceased partner, as an annuity, or (d) by a previous owner or part-
owner of the business, as consideration for the sale of goodwill or a 
share thereof. 
21. 
 
Section 6 of the Partnership Act appears to be based on 
the ruling of Jessel, M.R. in Ross v. Parkyns, [1871 R. 155]. He 
stated: “It is said (and about that there is no doubt) that the mere 
participation in profits inter se affords cogent evidence of a 
partnership. But it is now settled by the cases of Cox v. Hickman, 
Bullen v. Sharp and Mallwo, March & Co. v. Court of Wards, that 
although a right to participate in profits is a strong test of partnership, 
and there may be cases whereupon a simple participation in profits 
there is a presumption, not of law, but of fact, that there is a 
partnership, yet whether the relation of partnership does or does not 
exist must depend upon the whole contract between the parties, and 
that circumstance is not conclusive.”

22. 
 
Given the above, merely describing the parties to a deed 
as “partners” does not by itself establish a partnership. In Majooji 
Moosaj v. Tayebali and others (AIR 1933 Sind 210), the High Court 
ruled that even if parties describe themselves as “partners” in a written 
agreement, this does not constitute a partnership if their actual 
relationship is otherwise. Similarly, an agreement that purports to be 
something else may still be deemed a partnership if its essence and 
substance reveal such a relationship because the law considers the true 
nature of the agreement rather than its form. Likewise, in Karnidan 
Sarda and another v. Sailaja Kanta Mitra and another  
(AIR 1940 Pat. 683), it was held that the provisions of a document, as 
interpreted through proper legal analysis, determine its true character 
rather than the description given by the parties. 
23. 
 
In Raghunath Sahu and another v. Trinath Das and 
others (AIR 1985 Orissa 8), the High Court observed that the word 
“partner” is often used in a specific deed in a loose sense, without 
regard to the essential elements of a legal partnership. A statement in 
a document that “nothing therein contained would constitute the 
parties as partners” will not necessarily prevent them from being 
considered partners under the law. Likewise, a mere declaration that 
the parties are partners does not automatically establish a legal 
partnership. Therefore, the existence of a partnership must be 
determined by considering all relevant facts and the three essential 
elements of a partnership, viz., (i) there must be an agreement 
between all concerned persons, (ii) the agreement must be to share the 
profits of a business, and (iii) the business must be carried on by all or 
any of the persons acting on behalf of all. 
24. 
 
In The Province of West Pakistan v. G. V. Rattanchand 
Pir Mahfooz (a firm), [PLD 1958 (W.P.) Karachi 251], the defendant, 
Pir Mahfooz, contended that no firm existed under the name “Messrs 
G. V. Rattanchand Pir Mahfooz.” He argued that Messrs. G. V. 
Rattanchand & Co. was a separate entity conducting business at 
Boulton Market, while his firm, Pir Mahfooz, operated independently. 
Consequently, he claimed that the suit as filed was not maintainable. 

Crl.Misc.No.44858-B/2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 
 
 
 
 
The High Court rejected this argument, emphasizing that the 
determination of a partnership’s existence depends on the actual intent 
and conduct of the parties, as demonstrated by the facts of the case. 
While the right to share in the profits of a business is a strong 
indicator of a partnership, the Court clarified that the real test lies in 
the parties’ intentions and behaviour, not solely in profit-sharing 
arrangements. Documents on record showed that Pir Mahfooz and G. 
V. Rattanchand referred to each other as partners. Additionally, 
correspondence between them and the Government revealed that they 
presented themselves as acting jointly, with one acting as an agent for 
the other – an essential element of partnership law. The defendant did 
not dispute that the actions of either party in their dealings with the 
Government would bind both parties, which further supported the 
existence of a partnership. Based on this evidence, the Court held that 
a firm under the name “G. V. Rattanchand Pir Mahfooz” existed. 
25. 
 
In Essa E. H. Jaffer v. Nishat Ltd. [PLD 1962 (W.P.) 
Kar 603], the question arose whether the document in issue 
constituted a genuine partnership deed and whether, in pursuance 
thereof, the parties had become partners in the operation of two buses. 
The Court held that it is permissible for parties to structure profit-
sharing in any manner they choose. For instance, one partner may 
agree to receive a fixed annual or monthly sum rather than a variable 
share of the actual profits. It further noted that it is not essential for 
establishing a partnership for the parties to agree to share losses. The 
determination of whether a partnership exists in any given case 
depends on the specific facts and circumstances, as per section 6 of 
the Partnership Act. In the case under discussion, the agreement 
(Exh.6) between the parties explicitly referred to itself as a “deed of 
partnership,” and the parties described themselves as “working 
partner” and “financing partner.” Further, the two buses were to be 
operated “on behalf of this firm.” However, upon reviewing the 
agreement, the High Court found that the parties never intended to 
form a genuine partnership. The actual intent behind the arrangement 
was for the respondent to advance a loan of Rs. 20,000/- to the 
appellant-defendant, with an exorbitant interest rate of 48%. This 

Crl.Misc.No.44858-B/2024 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
 
 
 
 
arrangement was cleverly disguised as a partnership to circumvent the 
legal restrictions of the Sind Money Lenders Act and the Usurious 
Loans Act. 
26. 
 
In the present case, the existence of the Partnership Deed 
dated 28.04.2023 and the right of the Petitioner to participate in 
profits strongly indicates that the Petitioner and Ijaz Ahmad were 
partners in the firm. The Petitioner has not brought any material on 
record so far that may suggest he is not a partner in the firm.  
27. 
 
Section 23(1)(a)(vii) of the Drugs Act prohibits any 
person from exporting, importing, manufacturing for sale, or selling 
any drug that is either unregistered or not in compliance with 
registration conditions. Section 27 prescribes punishment for such 
offences. On 30.03.2024, the Complainant discovered five varieties of 
medicated cosmetics at the SSI’s factory, regarding which the 
Petitioner could not produce a manufacturing licence at the time of the 
raid or any time afterward. The Complainant seized those products 
vide Form 5 in the Petitioner’s presence, who signed and thumb-
marked it. The DTL later confirmed that they were unregistered and 
contained allopathic drugs as active ingredients. On a tentative 
assessment of the available record, there is sufficient incriminating 
material against the Petitioner.  
28. 
 
There is abundant case law that apprehension of arrest of 
an accused being for an ulterior motive, such as humiliation and 
unjustified harassment, is a sine qua non for pre-arrest bail. Reliance 
is placed on Muhammad Safdar and others v. The State  
(1983 SCMR 645), Zia-ul-Hassan v. The State (PLD 1984 SC 192), 
Ajmal Khan v. Liaqat Hayat and another (PLD 1998 SC 97), Rana 
Abdul Khaliq v. The State and others (2019 SCMR 1129). The 
Complainant is a Drug Inspector performing duties in the area where 
the SSI’s factory is located. The Petitioner’s counsel has been unable 
to satisfy us that he had any reason to falsely implicate the Petitioner 
in the case. 
29. 
 
This bail application has no merit and is, therefore, 
dismissed.

presented, without being influenced by these observations.
