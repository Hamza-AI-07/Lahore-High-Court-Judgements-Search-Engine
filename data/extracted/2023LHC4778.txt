Shahid Karim, J:-. This litigation includes a number of 
Intra Court Appeals arising out of a judgment passed by 
a learned Single Judge of this Court and reported as 
Munir Ahmad v. Government of Pakistan through 
Secretary Finance Islamabad and 19 others (PLD 2022 
Lahore 108) as well as constitutional petitions which 
were filed on a subsequent time and raised a common 
issue of law.  These appeals and constitutional petitions 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
2 
 
 
have been given in the appendix attached to this 
judgment as Appendix-I.  There is a common thread 
running through these appeals and petitions and 
challenges converge on the following issue of law which 
is engaged before this Court: 
 Does the power to fix price of essential 
commodities such as sugar in the present case lie 
in the Federal Government or the respective 
Provincial Governments under the Constitution 
of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973; and 
 Whether the Price Control and Prevention of 
Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977 is a valid 
piece of legislation. 
2. 
Mr. Shehzad A. Elahi, Advocate, learned counsel 
for the appellants/petitioners has handed a brief which 
narrates the historical facts leading up to this litigation.  
It would be expedient to set out the brief (edited for our 
purposes) which is done hereunder: 
i. 
“On March 25, 2021, the Governor of the Punjab 
issued the Punjab Sugar (Supply-chain Management) 
Order 2021(the “Supply-chain Order”) under the 
1958 Act. 
ii. 
On April 02, 2021, the Director (Prices), Directorate 
General of Industries, Prices, Weights and Measures 
Punjab, issued a notice to all Commissioners and 
Deputy Commissioners of Punjab, directing them to 
fix the price of sugar (the “Director Notice”), based 
on purported calculations of cost of sugar production 
made by Federal Government, and directed them to 
convene a meeting of District Price Control 
Committee for this purpose. It is pertinent to highlight 
that an ex-mill price of Rs. 80/kg was stated in the 
Director Notice, without referring to any data, notice 
or information on basis of which such rate was stated. 
The Director Notice also imposed a cap on retail 
price of sugar at Rs. 85/kg. 
iii. 
On 
April 
4, 
2021, 
the 
Secretary 
Industries 
Department, Government of Punjab issued a letter to 
all deputy commissioners in Punjab directing them to 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
3 
 
 
take certain actions under the Supply-chain Order in 
case of shortage of sugar in their districts. 
iv. 
A number of sugar mills filed Writ Petitions, 
including 
Writ 
Petition 
Nos. 
23318/2021, 
22970/2021, 22936/2021, 22977/2021, 30575/2021 
and 30577/2021, before the Lahore High Court, 
Lahore, against, inter alia, the Supply-chain Order 
and the Director Notice dated April 2, 2021 and 
subsequent notifications issued by the concerned 
Deputy Commissioners. All of these petitions were 
heard together as connected matters. A learned 
Single Judge vide interim order dated April 7, 2021 
allowed the respondents therein (Government of 
Punjab) to lift sugar up to the extent of 155,000 tons 
at a price of Rs. 80/kg as fixed by Government of 
Punjab on instructions of the Federal Government. 
The said quantity of sugar was lifted by the 
Government of Punjab. It was further directed that 
manner, mode of price fixation and the issue raised in 
the petition will be decided at the time of final 
hearing of the case.  
v. 
That subsequently, the Secretary, Ministry of 
Industries and Production, Government of Pakistan, 
in order to circumvent the orders of the Lahore High 
Court, Lahore, issued an order dated July 16, 2021, 
fixing consumer price of sugar at Rs. 88.24/kg. On the 
basis of said order, the Director General, Industries, 
Prices, Weight & Measures  (Punjab) through 
notification dated July 16, 2021 fixed the ex-mill price 
of sugar at Rs. 83.24/kg while retail price at Rs. 
88.24/kg. The aforesaid order and the notification 
were issued in an arbitrary manner without giving 
opportunity of hearing to the sugar mills. The sugar 
mills filed an application bearing C.M. No. 7 of 2021 
for interim relief in the aforementioned Writ Petition 
No. 23318 of 2021 against the aforementioned order 
and notification. The C.M. was taken up for hearing 
by on July 23, 2021, on which date, the Court was 
pleased to pass an appropriate order.  
vi. 
In compliance of the aforementioned order of the 
Lahore High Court, Lahore dated July 23, 2021, the 
sugar mills and the Government representatives had a 
meeting on July 27, 2021. However, the Ministry of 
Industries and Production, Government of Pakistan 
illegally and in blatant disregard of the orders of 
Lahore High Court, Lahore, issued an order dated 
July 30, 2021 (“Secretary Order”), which fixed the 
maximum retail price of sugar at Rs. 89.50/kg and 
presumed an ex-mill maximum price at Rs. 84.50/kg 
(inclusive of sales tax). On the basis of the said order, 
the Director General of Industries, Prices, Weight & 
Measures (Punjab) also issued an order on the same 
date i.e. July 30, 2021 (“DG Order”), wherein the 
Secretary Order was reproduced in ditto, and fixed 
the ex-mill maximum price at Rs. 84.50/kg. In this 
new price fixation, the Secretary Order and the DG 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
4 
 
 
Order unilaterally changed the calculations for 
recovery rates of molasses, profit ratio, sucrose 
recovery, etc. which were earlier agreed.  
vii. 
Vide Writ Petition No. 48555 of 2021 and other writs 
filed by various sugar mills including Writ Petitions 
Nos. 
49551/2021, 
51051/2021, 
51043/2021, 
51045/2021, 51050/2021, inter alia, the Secretary 
Order and the DG Order both dated July 30, 2021, 
were challenged before the Honourable Lahore High 
Court, Lahore, wherein the Honourable Court was 
pleased to grant interim relief vide order dated 
August 3, 2021.  
viii. 
The Federation of Pakistan through its Secretary 
Ministry of Industries and Production challenged the 
Interim Relief Order before the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan through C.P. Nos. 4540 and 4541 of 2021 
and the Supreme Court modified the interim relief 
order and disposed of the matter vide order dated 
August 12, 2021. 
ix. 
Thereafter, the Government of Pakistan promulgated 
the Price Control and Prevention of Profiteering and 
Hoarding Order, 2021 dated August 24, 2021 (the 
“2021 Order”), under Sections 3 and 4 of Price 
Control and Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding 
Act, 1977 (the “1977 Act”). Additionally, the 
Schedule to the 1977 Act has also been substituted, in 
terms of SRO No. 1065(I)/2021 dated August 24, 
2021. Under Section 3(b) of the 2021 Order, in 
respect of the commodities specified in Part II of the 
Schedule to the 1977 Act (which includes sugar), the 
business of determining price of sugar stands 
allocated to the Secretary, Ministry of National Food 
Security and Research, who shall exercise the powers 
of Controller General under the 2021 Order.  
x. 
The Lahore High Court, Lahore vide order dated 
August 26, 2021 of in Writ Petition No. 23318/2021 
and connected petitions, held: “learned Additional 
Attorney General has undertaken on behalf of the 
Federal Government that sugar price shall be 
determined afresh in accordance with the SRO 1062 
and the Appellate Authority shall also be notified 
accordingly.” The High Court directed de novo 
proceedings to be undertaken to determine the price. 
xi. 
Subsequently, Pakistan Sugar Mills Association 
(“PSMA”) received on September 6, 2021, a letter 
dated September 2, 2021, titled “Meeting on the Price 
Control and Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding 
Order, 2021 and Price Fixation of Sugar”. On 
September 07, 2021, PSMA submitted a detailed letter 
on subject of “Price of sugar” (the “PSMA Letter”), 
highlighting inter alia the background of the sugar 
industry and some of the adverse consequences of 
over-regulation and flawed government policies, how 
the ill-advised Government efforts to fix prices will 
completely distort the sugar supply chain and the 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
5 
 
 
blatant and repeated errors of the Government in its 
estimated cost of production of sugar. 
xii. 
In compliance with above noted orders of the Lahore 
High Court, PSMA held three meetings with the 
Committee of Ministry of National Food Security & 
Research, on the matter of determination of sugar 
rate: meetings dated September 08, 2021, September 
09, 2021 and September 13, 2021 respectively 
(collectively, the “Meetings”).  
xiii. 
Without appreciating or even addressing the detailed 
submissions made on behalf of sugar mills by PSMA, 
vide the PSMA Letter and during the Meetings, the 
Controller General of Prices/ Secretary, Ministry of 
National Food Security & Research arbitrarily issued 
the order bearing No.F.1-9/2014/DFSC-H/Sugarcane 
dated September 21, 2021 (the “2021 Sugar Price 
Order”), which fixed the maximum retail price of 
locally 
produced 
white 
crystalline 
sugar 
at 
Rs.89.75/kg and an ex-mill price maximum of 
Rs.84.75/Kg (inclusive of sales tax). The 2021 Sugar 
Price Order was issued in purported exercise of 
power under clause 3(b) of the 2021 Order.  
xiv. 
A number of sugar mills filed appeals against the 
2021 Sugar Price Order before the Appellate 
Committee constituted vide SRO No. 1122(I)/2021 
dated September 6, 2021 (which was later re-
constituted).  
xv. 
Meanwhile Deputy Commissioners across Punjab 
issued orders pursuant to section 8 of the Supply-
chain Order to sugar mills across the Province, 
arbitrarily directing mills to deliver sugar on daily 
basis to registered dealers in the concerned districts, 
at the ex-mill price of Rs. 84.75/kg as notified vide the 
2021 Sugar Price Order, in complete and utter 
disregard of the pendency of the Appeals before the 
statutory appellate forum.  
xvi. 
Many sugar mills filed writ petitions, including WP 
Nos. 
60005/2021, 
59553/2021, 
60010/2021, 
59367/2021 and 60007/2021, before the Lahore 
Court, wherein the sugar mills challenged inter-alia 
the Supply-chain Order and orders of the respective 
Deputy Commissioners noted above. W.P. No. 
59558/2021 titled ‘Shahtaj Sugar Mills Limited etc. 
vs. Federation of Pakistan etc.’ was also filed by 
various sugar mills raising, inter alia, several 
constitutional issues as well as the vires of the 1977 
Act and all actions taken thereunder. The Court, vide 
consolidated order dated September 29, 2021, was 
pleased to refer to matter to the Appellate Committee, 
and dispose of the petitions. 
xvii. 
Meanwhile the earlier pending litigation mentioned 
above in para (4) above including Writ Petition Nos. 
23318 of 2021 and 22977 of 2021 had been clubbed 
with a purported public interest litigation W.P. No. 
3834/2020 titled ‘Munir Ahmad vs Government of 
Pakistan etc.’ filed before the Lahore High Court in 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
6 
 
 
which a challenge was made to, inter alia, a 
purported price hike vis-à-vis ‘white crystalline 
sugar’. All the aforementioned cases were disposed of 
by the learned Single Bench vide a consolidated 
Judgment dated September 29, 2021 (reported as 
PLD 2022 Lah 108). Against the stated judgment, 
various Intra Court Appeals have been preferred 
including the Intra-Court Appeal Nos. 61721/2021, 
61692/2021, 61698/2021, 61701/2021, 61690/2021, 
61698/2021, 61704/2021, 61716/2021, 61694/2021, 
61715/2021, 61692/2021, 61655/2021, which are 
pending before a Division Bench of the Lahore High 
Court. 
xviii. 
Thereafter the Appellate Committee of the Ministry of 
National Food Security & Research, Government of 
Pakistan passed the decision dated October 07, 2021 
(the “2021 Decision”). The assumption of jurisdiction 
by the Federal Government, including the vires of the 
1977 Act, the promulgation of the 2021 Order dated 
August 24, 2021 and the 2021 Sugar Price Order 
passed by Secretary MNFSR dated September 21, 
2021 and the 2021 Decision passed by the Appellate 
Committee dated October 07, 2021 were challenged 
by many sugar mills through various writ petitions 
before the Honourable Lahore High Court, including 
Writ Petitions 63163/2021, 63016/2021, 63011/2021, 
63013/2021, 63015/2021, 63012/2021, 63014/202, 
62989/2021, which are being heard alongwith the 
aforementioned ICAs and are pending adjudication. 
xix. 
Thereafter the Secretary, Ministry of National Food 
Security and Research arbitrarily, in undue haste, 
with mala fide and in an ex-parte manner issued the 
Order No.F.No.2-8/2022/SAB/A-IV dated April 20, 
2023 (the “2023 Sugar Price Order”) wherein he 
fixed the ex-mill and retail price of sugar at Rs. 
95.57/kg 
and 
Rs. 
98.82/kg 
respectively. 
The 
Respondent functionaries of the Government of 
Punjab, vide the letters dated April 20 and 26, 2023, 
sought to enforce the illegal 2023 Sugar Price Order 
on the sugar mills in Punjab and threatened illegal 
and coercive measures to unlawfully implement and 
enforce the same. The aforementioned illegal actions 
were challenged by various sugar mills including, 
inter alia, through appeals before the Appellate 
Committee and through Writ Petitions including W.P. 
No. 
28772/2023, 
28771/2023, 
28767/2023, 
28768/2023, 28769/2023, 28647/2023, 28773/2023, 
28766/2023, 28770/2023, 28641/2023, 288891/2023, 
28881/2023, 28891/2023 and 30156/202 wherein this 
honourable Court, vide order dated May 2, 2023 
issued notice and restrained the Respondents from 
taking any coercive measures. Thereafter, vide order 
dated May 4, 2023, this Honourable Court suspended 
the 2023 Sugar Price Order as well as suspended the 
proceedings before the Appellate Committee where 
appeals of the sugar mills are pending. Thereafter, 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
7 
 
 
vide order dated May 24, 2023 these cases were 
transferred to be heard alongwith earlier cases (WPs 
and ICAs) pending before the learned Division 
Bench. 
xx. 
The Federal Government filed CPLAs against the 
aforementioned interim orders dated May 4, 2023 
before the Supreme Court which were disposed on 
September 12, 2023 with no modification/withdrawal 
of the interim orders dated May 4, 2023. 
xxi. 
On July 28, 2023, the Governor of Punjab 
promulgated the Punjab Foodstuff (Sugar) Order, 
2023 (the “2023 Sugar Order”) (purportedly in 
exercise of powers under Section 3 of the 1958 Act). 
Thereafter on July 30, 2023, which was a holiday, a 
notice was sent to Punjab Zone of the Pakistan Sugar 
Mills Association (a trade association of sugar mills) 
(“PSMA”), through Whatsapp to its Manager Admin, 
titled “COST OF PRODUCTION OF SUGAR TO 
FIX THE EX-MILL SUGAR PRICES UNDER 
SECTION 4 OF PUNJAB FOODSTUFFS (SUGAR) 
ORDER, 2023”. 
xxii. 
The 2023 Sugar Order as well above notices have 
been challenged by PSMA and a number of sugar 
mills 
through 
various 
writ 
petitions 
in 
the 
Honourable Lahore High Court (including Writ 
Petition Nos. 49812/2023, 49955/2023, 49833/2023, 
49831/2023, 49826/2023, 49828/2023, 49825/2023, 
49822/2023, 49824/2023, 49830/2023, 49829/2023, 
50974/2023, 
50982/2023, 
49834/2023 
and 
50995/2023, wherein vide interim order dated August 
1, 2023 the Honourable Lahore High Court was 
pleased to grant interim relief. 
xxiii. 
Subsequently, 
on 
September 
5, 
2023, 
the 
aforementioned cases were also transferred by the 
learned Single Judge to be heard alongwith earlier 
cases (WPs and ICAs) pending before the learned 
Division Bench.” 
3. 
It can be seen from the narration set out above 
that the challenges were made primarily to the Price 
Control and Prevention of Profiteering & Hoarding 
Order, 2021 (the 2021 Order) dated August 24, 2021 
issued under the powers conferred on the Federal 
Government by Sections 3 and 4 of Price Control and 
Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977 (the 
1977 Act).  In addition to the above, the Schedule to the 
1977 Act has also been substituted in terms of SRO 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
8 
 
 
No.1065(I)/2021 dated August 24, 2021.  Under Section 
3(b) of the 2021 Order in respect of the commodities 
specified in Part II of the Schedule to the 1977 Act 
(which include sugar) the business of determining price 
of sugar stands allocated to the Secretary, Ministry of 
National Food Security and Research who shall exercise 
the powers of the Controller General under the 2021 
Order. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the appellants/ petitioners 
contended firstly that the challenge before the learned 
Single Judge was to the legislative competence of the 
Parliament to enact a law and thereafter for the Federal 
Government to determine the price of sugar of which the 
present appellants and petitioners are manufacturer and 
producers within the Province of Punjab.  Earlier, the 
law which governed such matters was the Punjab 
Foodstuffs (Control) Act, 1958 (the 1958 Act).  While 
on the subject it may be expedient to state that another 
law which had relation to the subject matter was the 
Essential Commodities Act, 1957 which was repealed by 
the 1977 Act.  The learned Single Judge however turned 
his focus to the public interest litigation which was 
already pending and in most parts based the impugned 
judgment on that litigation and the contentions raised 
therein.  Learned counsel for the appellants/ petitioners 
have submitted that they took serious issue regarding 
Federal Government’s power to fix price of sugar under 
the 1977 Act and at no point of time was there a 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
9 
 
 
concession on their part regarding this issue.  It was held 
by the learned Single Judge that the 18th amendment had 
not taken away or affected the Federal Government’s 
powers under the 1977 Act.  Reliance was placed on a 
judgment of a Full Bench of this Court reported as LPG 
Association of Pakistan through Chairman v. Federation 
of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum 
and Natural Resources, Islamabad and others (2021 
CLD 214).  In a nub, the impugned judgment by the 
learned Single Judge is based upon the concept of Inter-
Provincial Trade as encapsulated in Article 151 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the 
1973 Constitution) and Entry 13 of Part II of the Fourth 
Schedule to the Constitution (Entry 13) which 
comprises the Federal Legislative List.  In the present 
constitutional dispensation, there is only one list in our 
Constitution which is the Federal Legislative List on 
which the Parliament can legislate.  The rest of the 
subjects which are not enumerated in the Federal 
Legislative List are within the competence of the 
Provincial Assemblies.  During the oral arguments 
before us, learned D.A.G reiterated that competence of 
the Federal Government was derived from Article 151 
read with Entry 13.  In conclusion, it was held that the 
forum for price fixation had been determined by the 
2021 Order and since the power lies with the Federal 
Government, the matter was referred in terms of the 
2021 Order (SRO 1062) for decision by the Appellate 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
10 
 
 
Committee constituted thereby to be treated as a 
representation on the Court’s direction and decided 
through speaking order.  Learned counsel for the 
appellants/ petitioners have challenged the impugned 
judgment as well as the act of the Federal Government 
in enacting the 2021 Order and the price  fixation under 
that Order on the premise that these questions have not 
been determined by the learned Single Judge and the 
entire gemut of legal arguments raised in relation to the 
constitutionality of the 1977 Act and the 2021 Order 
have escaped the attention of the learned Single Judge. 
5. 
At the outset, we would like to refer to the 
position taken by the learned Advocate General, Punjab 
in his submissions under Order XXVII-A of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 whose notice was issued by this 
Court.  It has been stated that: 
“i. 
Previously Essential Commodities Act, 1957 
and Punjab Foodstuff (Control) Act, 1958 clearly 
defined the limits of authority of each Federal 
Government 
and 
Provincial 
Government 
i.e 
Provincial Governments were to fix price the 
maximum retail price of sugar in a province and if 
sugar is transported between provinces, the 
regulation and price fixation  of the same shall be 
administered by Federal Government.  
ii. 
The promulgation of Price Control and 
Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977 
claiming jurisdiction of the whole of Pakistan and 
repeal of Essential Commodities Act, 1957 blurred 
the scenario since Punjab Foodstuff (Control) Act, 
1958 was still in force but a Federal Law hindered its 
operation.  
iii. 
Since Punjab Provincial Government was 
acting under authority given to it by Entry No.14 of 
the Concurrent Legislative List, it started following 
the mandate of Price Control and Prevention of 
Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977 and kept acting 
under the delegated authority of Federal Government 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
11 
 
 
under Section 4 of Price Control and Prevention of 
Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977. 
iv. 
With the omission of Concurrent Legislative 
List, the Federal Government was stripped of the 
power to administer the subject of price fixation of 
sugar within the territorial limits of a Province. 
The promulgation and later lapse of Price Control 
and Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding 
Ordinance, 2022 does not leave the Punjab 
Provincial 
Government 
without 
any 
statutory 
authority to govern and administer the subject since 
(a) another provincial and valid law i.e Punjab 
Foodstuff (Control) Act, 1958 exists and after 
removal of the hurdle of a Federal Law, it can start 
functioning as before, and (b) Price Control and 
Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 1977 
has, automatically, become a Provincial Law clothing 
the Punjab Government with enough power to 
administer the provisions of it in light of PLD 2016 
Lah. 433 & PLD 2016 Lah. 699.” 
6. 
Therefore, the Province of Punjab is in no manner 
of doubt that it has the capacity and the competence to 
control and fix prices of the essential food commodities 
including sugar and it is outwith the authority of the 
Federal Government under the Constitution.  We 
approve the statement by the learned Advocate General 
Punjab which hews more closely to the constitutional 
scheme.  Our reasons for holding so would be brought 
forth in the following paragraphs.  It may also be noted 
that contentions and arguments of learned counsel for 
the parties shall be dealt with during the course of this 
judgment and will not be stated separately. 
7. 
We firstly turn to the contentions raised by the 
learned D.A.G and the reliance on various provisions of 
law and the Constitution to seek an authority to vest in 
the Federal Government regarding price control and 
fixation of prices of essential foodstuff commodities.  

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
12 
 
 
Learned D.A.G firstly referred to Article 151 of the 
Constitution which provides that: 
“151. (1) Subject to clause (2), trade, commerce and 
intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be free. 
(2) 1 [Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament)] may by law 
impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, 
commerce or inter-course between one Province and 
another or within any part of Pakistan as may be 
required in the public interest. 
(3) 
A 
Provincial 
Assembly 
or 
a 
Provincial 
Government shall not have power to—  
(a) make any law, or take any executive 
action, prohibiting or restricting the entry 
into, or the export from, the Province of goods 
of any class or description, or  
(b) impose a tax which, as between goods 
manufactured or produced in the Province 
and similar goods not so manufactured or 
produced, discriminates in favour of the 
former goods or which, in the case of goods

(4) An Act of a Provincial Assembly which imposes 
any reasonable restriction in the interest of public 
health, public order or morality, or for the purpose of 
protecting animals or plants from disease or

was made with the consent of the President, be 
invalid.” 
8. 
The above provision in the Constitution relates to 
Inter-Provincial trade and clearly states that the trade, 
commerce and intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be 
free.  This is the essential and primary purpose of Article 
151 and it cannot be extended to encapsulate powers 
which are not envisaged and which do not reside in 
either the Federal Government or a Provincial 
Government.  By clause 3, a Provincial Assembly and a 
Provincial Government has been enjoined from making 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
13 
 
 
any law or taking any executive action prohibiting or 
restricting the entry into or the export from the Province 
of goods of any class or description and by paragraph (b) 
of clause 3, a tax which, as between goods manufactured 
or produced in the Province and similar goods not so 
manufactured or produced, discriminates in favour of the 
former goods or which, in the case of goods 
manufactured or produced outside the Province 
discriminates between goods manufactured or produced 
in any area in Pakistan and similar goods manufactured 
or produced in any other area in Pakistan.  This was 
elaborated in a judgment reported as Murree Brewery 
Company Limited through Chief Executive v. Province 
of Punjab through Chief Secretary and others (PLD 
2017 Lahore 230) which was authored by one of us 
(Shahid Karim, J.) and on which learned D.A.G placed 
reliance.  The dispute in Murree Brewery Co. related to 
a notification issued by the Governor of Punjab in terms 
of sections 31 and 32 of the Punjab Excise Act, 1940 
and levied an excise duty on all Pakistan Made Foreign 
Liquor and Beer meant for consumption outside the 
Province of Punjab as well.  Therefore, the notification 
under challenge impacted the manufacturers and 
producers of liquor outside the Province of Punjab and 
discriminated against them.  They were, therefore, 
compelled to bring a constitutional petition before this 
Court which was decided by the judgment in Murree 
Brewery Co.  It was further held that Article 151 was in 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
14 
 
 
the same mould as the commerce clause in the U.S 
Constitution.  Some of the observations made in Murree 
Brewery Co. would be relevant for our purposes and 
more particularly in order to stunt the arguments raised 
by the learned D.A.G in relying upon that judgment: 
“30. Juxtaposing Art. 151 of our Constitution with 
the commerce clause of US Constitution would bring 
forth that there is no parallel provision to clause (1) 
of Art. 151 in the US Constitution. Clause (2) 
however replicates and echoes the spirit of the 
commerce clause. As if this was not enough, the 
framers of our Constitution, by drawing from the 
treatment which the US Supreme Court had given this 
clause throughout each stage in its history and its 
interpretation of the commerce power, enacted 
clauses (1) and (2) in order to leave nothing to 
imagination and reinforce and drive home the federal 
form of the Constitution. Article 151 epitomisis the 
spirit of federalism not to be undone by subterfuge or 
an evasive device. Clauses (1) and (2), read together, 
sufficiently indicate that issues of Inter-Provincial 
Trade, commerce and intercourse have centered on 
the ability of the Parliament to regulate commerce 
among the Provinces. Clause (1) has been culled out 
from the American experience and is a leaf out of the 
Australian Constitution.” 
“36. The above observations are the essence of Art. 
151 as well. Where there is commerce which concerns 
more states then one‘, the power lies with the 
Parliament and a Province cannot regulate that 
activity. Thus commercial activities ‗which were 
completely within a State, ‗were immune from federal 
power, only. The rest must yield in favour of federal 
commerce power.” 
“…A purely original and textualist approach based 
on what the founding fathers meant would lead to the 
conclusion that Article 151 gave expression to the 
important concept of federalism which underlies the 
scheme of the Constitution. It is a repository of the 
powers to vest in the Federal Government with 
regard 
to 
trade, 
commerce 
and 
intercourse 
throughout Pakistan. Also by clause (2) that power 
has come to reside in the Parliament to , by law, 
impose such restrictions on the freedom of trace, 
commerce or intercourse between one Province and 
another or within any part of Pakistan as may be 
required in the public interest. It follows, therefore, 
that a Provincial legislature is not empowered to 
enact a law which imposes such a restriction and it 
was with this intention that clause (1) stated in 
emphatic terms that the trade, commerce and 
intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be free. 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
15 
 
 
Legislative history has always been treated as 
worthwhile aid to ascertain the intention behind an 
enactment 
and 
in 
particular 
a 
constitutional 
document. The speech of Abdul Hafeez Pirzada, the 
then Law Minister, who introduced the constitutional 
bill has been reproduced above. In a nub, the basic 
intention for enacting clauses (1) and (2) of Article 
151 was based on experience from disputes which 
arose due to the omissions in a similar Article under 
the 
Constitution 
which 
resulted 
in 
unsavory 
situations…” 
9. 
Murree Brewery Co. is not a case which supports 
the arguments of learned D.A.G nor does it render the 
act of the Federal Government in the enactment of the 
1977 Act or the 2021 Order as valid and constitutional. 
10. 
Prior to this we will have to analyse the crucial 
question which engages this Court in these matters.  
That question relates to the constitutionality of the 1977 
Act.  Notwithstanding the repeal of the Concurrent 
Legislative List after the promulgation of the 18th 
amendment in the year 2010, the Federal Government 
continues to exercise powers under the 1977 Act for the 
purpose of controlling and fixing prices of essential 
commodities mentioned in the Schedule to the 1977 Act.  
Thus we are called upon to dilate upon and determine 
whether the Parliament had the power to enact the 1977 
Act by virtue of any of the entries in the Federal 
Legislative List.  It is common ground between the 
parties that there has been no change in different 
provisions of the Constitution regarding entries in 
Fourth Schedule under which the Parliament derives its 
powers in respect of price control of essential 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
16 
 
 
commodities.  The source of that power as stated above 
is Entry 13 which provides that: 
“13. Inter-Provincial 
matters 
and 
coordination”. 
11. 
Mr. Shehzad A. Elahi, Advocate referred to the 
historical context in which this Entry has found mention 
in the constitutional documents preceding the 1973 
Constitution.  In the 1956 Constitution, the subject ‘price 
control’ finds mention in the concurrent list whereas in 
the 1962 Constitution the subject of price control did not 
figure in the third schedule which was the only list in the 
1962 Constitution.  Once again, the 1973 Constitution 
did not contain the subject of price control in the Federal 
Legislative List nor was it included in the concurrent 
legislative list as originally enacted on 17th of April, 
1973.  Later on by the 18th amendment the concurrent 
legislative list was done away with and, therefore, the 
only entry which finds mention now and which remotely 
deals with the subject, according to the learned D.A.G, 
is Entry 13.  As adumbrated, we do not find the subject 
of price control and fixation of prices of essential 
commodities to inhere in Entry 13 as the subject matter 
of this Entry is essentially regarding Inter-Provincial 
matters and has direct nexus with Article 151 of the 
Constitution.  In the case of Murree Brewery Co., it has 
clearly been held that scope of Article 151 was 
quintessentially related to matters amongst the Provinces 
and cannot be used to encroach upon the legislative field 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
17 
 
 
of the Provinces.  If this were allowed to be done, there 
would be a complete constitutional muddle and 
undermining of the concept of federalism as also this 
would run contrary to the intention of the framers of the 
18th amendment which was designed to empower the 
Provinces and not to curtail their legislative powers.  
This aspect of the matter has been brought forth in 
another judgment relied upon by Mr. Shehzad A. Elahi, 
Advocate, learned counsel for the appellants/petitioners 
and rendered by one of us (Shahid Karim J.).  That 
judgment is reported as Vice Chairman Punjab Bar 
Council & others v. Govt. of the Punjab & others (PLD 
2021 Lah. 544) and the following paragraphs are being 
set out below which shed light on the proper concept of 
federalism on which the 1973 Constitution is structured: 
“28. The Constitution envisages a limited government 
which means that it has put in place a system of 
restraints and limitations to constrain its power and 
to define its periphery. Ours is a representative 
democracy in which the people act not directly but 
through their representatives. This system of 
government is called republicanism. Thus, a republic 
is a democracy but a representative democracy.” 
“38. Thus the constitutional balance of federal and 
provincial powers would be upset if there are no 
restrictions on actions by the Federal Government 
which threatens the separate existence and vitality of 
provincial and local government which play an 
important role in the constitution‟s architecture.” 
“…A strong national government is indeed necessary 
yet it has to be balanced by a robust provincial 
autonomy so that the rights of individuals in the 
provincial sphere are ably protect and granted to 
them to be enjoyed to the fullest extent. For, we must 
bear in mind the indubitable fact that our constitution 
delineates different fields within which the respective 
legislatures i.e. Parliament and provincial assemblies 
are empowered to legislate and so within these fields 
of activity, only the relevant legislature may legislate 
and none else.” 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
18 
 
 
“50. These features of federalism are scattered 
throughout the Constitution. The principles have to be 
adhered by different constitutional authorities, by the 
Federal 
Government 
as 
well 
as 
provincials 
governments as this would, in turn, engender rule of 
law. We must bear in mind that in a country governed 
by a written constitution, the written constitution is 
the rule of law. While the rule of law underlies our 
entire Constitution in particular, Articles 4 and 5 
seem to embody the essence of the rule of law. It was 
observed by Kaikaus J. in Jamal Shah v. Election 
Commission (PLD 1966 SC 1) that rule of law 
prevents “the government from taking any action in 
this country from which there is no legal sanction and 
at the same time bars the legislature from creating an 
authority whose actions are not subject to law.” The 
legislature cannot enact that whatever action a 
particular person may take shall be immune from 
challenge. All persons exercising authority in 
Pakistan must do so only in accordance with law. In 
Ahmad Nawaz v. Pakistan (PLD 1998 Sindh 180) it 
was held that ―Pakistan is a republic. In this 
country, there is government of laws and not men.”” 
12. 
Entry 13 reads “inter-provincial matters and co-
ordination”. At first blush it seems that the Entry targets 
matters which arise amongst Provinces and which 
require resolution by a neutral arbiter. There may be a 
wide variety of matters on which the Provinces may 
have a falling out and lest those matter get out of hand, 
the Federal Government may intervene which, by Entry 
13, is its constitutional duty. But the underlying theme 
of Entry 13 is for an inter-provincial matter to arise in 
order to clothe the Federal Government the power to 
step in. That is, one Province shall have to raise a 
grievance against another which then gives rise to an 
inter-provincial matter. The Parliament may enact a law 
to deal with such a situation but it cannot, under a 
misplaced notion, have a legislative blank check to 
encroach upon Provinces’ primary powers to legislate on 
a field of activity. The statutory wording makes it clear 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
19 
 
 
that the field of ‘food’ is within the legislative 
competence of a Provincial Assembly. By necessary 
implication  therefore, the price control of foods as an 
essential commodity is also within the Province’s 
competence. This flows from the holding of superior 
Courts as well. There can be no contention that if only a 
Provincial Assembly can legislate upon the subject 
matter of ‘food’, all ancillary matters including price 
control would be included in the broad power so 
conferred. The Parliament cannot arrogate to itself the 
power of price control in the guise of Entry 13 (which is 
an entry having unspecific contours) while a specific 
subject-matter lies within the power of a Provincial 
Assembly. If this were allowed to the Parliament, the 
entire edifice of federalism and provincial autonomy 
will have dissipated.  
13. 
In the present case, Punjab has not had the chance to 
fix prices. That power has been usurped by the Federal 
Government as a permanent feature. No other Province 
therefore had a grouse in respect of an executive action taken 
by Punjab. This begs the question: How does this become an 
inter-provincial matter? At worst, this may degenerate into a 
matter between the Federal Government and a particular 
Province which may choose to dispute the price fixed by the 
Federal Government. Worse still, an essential food 
commodity may be such that it is not exported to other 
Provinces at all. Would that still be an inter-provincial matter 
to empower the Parliament to enact a law. It follows 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
20 
 
 
indubitably that the primary task of price fixation of an 
essential food commodity is within a provincial government’s 
competence. It can only transition into an inter-provincial 
matter if another Province raises serious objections to it on 
plea that the price affects businesses adversely in that 
Province. Apart from this, the subject-matter of food and its 
allied matters such as price fixation remain within the 
armoury of powers of a Provincial Assembly. 
14. 
Learned D.A.G submits that intention in residing 
this power in the Parliament is to have uniformity in 
prices across all Provinces.  Clearly, this is not the 
intention of Article 151 nor is there any such power 
conferred upon the Parliament by virtue of Entry 13.  In 
a given situation, the manufacturers and producers of 
essential commodities in the Province of Punjab may not 
be dealing with their commodities for export to other 
Provinces.  Can it conceivably be held that the 
Parliament would still have the power to regulate the 
prices of commodities which do not have any Inter-
Provincial connotation.  The answer is clearly in the 
negative and what is conceived by Article 151 of the 
Constitution is to prohibit making of laws which 
constrict the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse 
between one Province and another.  By Article 151, the 
power of the Provinces and the Provincial Governments 
is limited and they cannot make laws which prohibit or 
restrict the entry into or export from the Province of 
goods of any class or description.  It is not the case of 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
21 
 
 
the Federal Government that the Province of Punjab is 
indulging in any of these acts and, therefore, must be 
constrained by the enactment of the 1977 Act. 
15. 
Mr. Imtiaz Rashid Siddiqui, Advocate learned 
counsel for some of the appellants/petitioners alluded to 
various provisions of the 1977 Act.  In particular, 
section 3 confers the powers on the Federal Government 
to make orders to provide for regulating the prices, 
production, supply, distribution and sale of essential 
commodities (including food and foodstuff) and for the 
price to be charged or paid for it at any stage of the 
transaction.  In fact, the preamble of the 1977 Act 
provides that: 
“Whereas it is expedient to provide for price 
control and prevention of profiteering and 
hoarding.” 
16. 
The 1977 Act essentially deals with price control 
yet there is no power under the Constitution for the 
Parliament to enact such a law which relates to price 
control 
of 
essential 
food 
commodities 
being 
manufactured and produced in a Province and regarding 
which that Province has the exclusive jurisdiction to 
make laws.  The power of the Parliament is limited to 
regulating the Inter-Provincial trade and commerce and 
no more.  This does not include the power of price 
control or price fixation of an essential commodity.  For 
the purpose, a Provincial Government is best suited to 
determine that price considering various circumstances 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
22 
 
 
which exist in that Province and will do so upon 
consideration of the factors necessary to be taken into 
account while fixing the price of an essential 
commodity.  It will also be noted that the price control 
of an essential commodity is not required to be 
undertaken at all times.  It can vary from one Province to 
the other and it may not be necessary to be done in one 
Province as against another Province and regarding this 
aspect too, that Province would be the best judge under 
the circumstances.  The Federal Government cannot be 
conferred the power to do so across all Provinces 
without regard to the fact that the action to control price 
of an essential commodity is not required to be 
undertaken in a particular Province. 
17. 
It is interesting to note that by amendment in the 
Schedule to the 1977 Act , the power was delegated 
upon the officers of the Provinces by a notification dated 
12.06.2006.  The Province of Punjab stepped forward 
and seized the opportunity while enacting the Price 
Control and Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding 
(Amendment) Ordinance, 2022 and which was an 
attempt to adapt the 1977 Act for the purposes of 
Province of Punjab.  This was done purportedly upon the 
notion that price control was a Provincial subject and 
that the 1977 Act was an existing law which could be 
adapted for the purposes of Province of Punjab.  This 
was a fallacy on the part of the Province of Punjab.  In 
fact the 1977 Act is clearly not an existing law under the 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
23 
 
 
1973 Constitution and could not have been adapted for 
the purposes of Province of Punjab.  That is why 
perhaps it was allowed to lapse as a binding law at the 
end of its life.  In the meantime the Province 
promulgated the Punjab Prevention of Speculation in 
Essential Commodities Act, 2021 as well which was 
done to provide for prevention of speculation in essential 
commodities to curb artificial price hike and profiteering 
in the best public interest.  Once again, this was done 
under the powers conferred upon the Province of Punjab 
by the Constitution.  The Province of Punjab also 
brought in the Punjab Prevention of Hoarding Act, 2020 
to provide for the prevention of hoarding in respect of 
scheduled articles.  All of these laws point to the firm 
belief by the Province of Punjab that under the 1973 
Constitution it has the power to enact laws relating to 
food and price control and this was the exclusive domain 
of the Provincial Assembly. 
18. 
Learned counsel for the appellants/ petitioners 
rely upon a judgment rendered by the Sindh High Court 
and reported as Nadeem Mumtaz Raja v. Sindh Food 
Authority (2021 MLD 478) which has held that the 
subject of food did not find mention in the Federal 
Legislative List as it stands today and therefore is a 
subject within the Provincial domain.  While doing so, 
reliance was placed on another judgment of the Sindh 
High Court authored by Munib Akhtar J. and reported as 
Azfar Laboratory (Pvt.) Ltd. V. Federation of Pakistan 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
24 
 
 
and others (PLD 2018 Sindh 448) wherein the learned 
Judge articulated the scope of legislative entries.  During 
the course of that judgment reliance was also placed on a 
finding given by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
‘Bottled Water’ case where it was held that food as a 
subject was within the Provincial domain under the 
Constitution.  We concur with the findings in these 
judgments. 
19. 
In view of the above, it is declared that: 
a) The 1977 Act is ultra vires the powers of the 
Parliament to the extent that it applies to price 
control of essential foodstuff commodities and 
prevention of profiteering and hoarding in 
relation to the Province of Punjab and is held to 
be without lawful authority and of no legal effect. 
b) The 1977 Act to the extent that it extends to the 
whole of Pakistan is an action extra jus and thus 
unconstitutional. 
c) Consequently, the actions taken pursuant of the 
1977 Act, by the Federal Government and its 
officers and the Govt. of the Punjab (and its 
officers) on the dictation of Federal Government 
(more particularly mentioned in paragraph 2 
(XVIII and XIX) are ultra vires and non est. 
d) Both the 1977 Act to the extent mentioned above 
as well as the 2021 Order are hereby struck down. 

 
ICA No.61692 of 2021 
25 
 
 
20. 
It is made clear that food and price control of 
essential food commodities as a field of legislation are 
within the power of the Provincial Assembly to enact 
and which may be done by the Province of Punjab by 
appropriate legislation or the Provincial Government 
may proceed under the existing law. 
21. 
Before we tear away, it may be stated that we 
have refrained from giving an opinion on whether the 
1977 Act still applies to the Islamabad Capital territory 
as that question does not arise before us.  The 
Constitution and law will take its own course, in this 
regard.
