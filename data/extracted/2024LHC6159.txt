The brief facts of the prosecution case, as stated by Mst. 
Shakeela Bibi (PW-3), the victim of the case, in her statement before the 
learned trial court, are as under:-  
“Stated that on 24.06.2021 at about 10.00 p.m. accused persons Imran, 
Sajjad present before this court, facing trial and Bashir Ahmed (since 
P.O) came over there on a white coloured car when I was outside of my 
house on the call of nature. Accused Sajjad & Bashir put me forcibly in 
car while accused Imran was driver of said car. Today took me towards 
Liaquatpur side on said car and kept me at some unknown place for 
about 12/13 days. On third day, accused Karim Bakhsh present before 
this court, facing trial came over there and put off my gold ornaments. 
Accused Sajjad committed Ziati with me while accused persons Bashir 
& Imran guarded the situation. Thereafter, accused persons left me at 
night time near to my house. Then I went inside my house, wherefrom 
we went to police station and narrated the occurrence. Police also 
produced me in the court. My medical examination was conducted at 
Pacca Laran under the guard of lady constable. Police also took me to 
Lahore for further examination.” 
 
4. 
 
After the formal investigation of the case report under section 
173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted before the 
learned trial court and the accused were sent to face trial. The learned trial 
court framed the charge against the accused on 10.02.2023 to which the 

3 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
accused pleaded not guilty and the learned trial court proceeded to examine 
the prosecution witnesses. 
 
5. 
 
The prosecution in order to prove its case got recorded 
statements of as many as twelve witnesses. Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3), the 
prosecutrix, narrated the facts of the occurrence. Muhammad Zafar (PW-1) 
and Zahoor Ahmed (PW-2) stated that they saw the accused kidnapping Mst. 
Shakeela Bibi (PW-3) and were told by Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3) that she 
was raped by the appellant. Wazeer Ahmed 1352/C (PW-11) stated that on 
12.01.2022, he executed the warrant of arrest of the appellant and also 
published the proclamation under section 87 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898 regarding the appellant. Abdul Qadir, ASI (PW-6) 
investigated the case from 25.03.2022 till 07.04.2022 and detailed the facts 
discovered during the investigation of the case in his statement before the 
learned trial court. Sumera Rafiq ASI, (PW-4) investigated the case from

4 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
detailed the facts discovered during the investigation of the case in his 
statement before the learned trial court. 
 
6. 
 
The prosecution also got Dr. Hina Siddiqui, (PW-9) examined, 
who on 07.07.2021 was posted as a Woman Medical Officer at RHC Pacca 
Laran, District Rahim Yar Khan and on the same day, conducted the medical 
examination of the victim namely Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3). Dr. Hina 
Siddiqui, (PW-9), after examining Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3), observed as 
under:- 
 
“Tears, lacerations, bruises, abrasions, swelling, hyperemia at the private 
parts with specific site from in reference to lithotomy position on and 
around the private parts 
 
Swelling at introitus .A bruise extending from 4-7'0 clock position at 
vaginal orifice (sic)  
 
2. Rupture of hymen, if present fresh or old.            
Ruptured 
………… 
 
 Keeping on analysis of report of PFSA & clinical examination, I am of 
the opinion that no seminal material was found on the samples sent to 
PFSA for analysis. However, hymen was ruptured and genital injuries 
were present. 
 
Ex.P.H is the carbon copy of MLC report of victim issued by myself. My 
final opinion is Ex.P.H/1.The same is signed by me and is in my hand-
writing, bearing seal of the hospital also. Pictorial diagrams Ex.P.H/2 & 
Ex.P.H/3 are also drawn by me. I prove my hand-writing and signatures 
on these documents .” (emphasis supplied).  
 
The prosecution also got Dr. Junaid Nadeem (PW-8) examined who stated 
that he had examined the appellant on 14.07.2021 and found him capable of 
having sexual intercourse. 
 
7. 
 
On 14.02.2023, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor 
gave up prosecution witness namely Mushtaq Ahmad as being collusive 

5 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
with the appellant. On 27.02.2023, the learned Assistant District Public 
Prosecutor closed the prosecution evidence. 
 
8. 
 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court 
examined the appellant Sajjad Ahmad son of Kareem Bakhsh, under section 
342 Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question why this case against you and why 
the PWs have deposed against you, he stated that he had been falsely 
involved in the case. Neither the appellant opted to get himself examined 
under section 340(2) Cr. P.C nor he adduced any evidence in his defence. 
 
9. 
 
On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions 
Judge, Liaquatpur, convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to 
above.  
 
10. 
 
The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant 
precisely was that the whole case was invented and untrue and that the 
prosecution remained unable to prove the facts in issue and did not produce 
any unimpeachable, admissible and relevant evidence. Learned counsel for 
the appellant further submitted that the appellant was quite innocent and had 
nothing to do with the alleged occurrence. The learned counsel for the 
appellant submitted that the learned trial court, while disbelieving the same 
evidence, had acquitted Kareem Bakhsh son of Allah Dewaya and 
Muhammad Imran son of Wazir Ahmed, the co-accused of the appellant and 
the conviction awarded to the appellant on the basis of same evidence was 
not justified. He further submitted that the prosecution has miserably failed 
to prove the charge against the appellant beyond the shadow of reasonable 

6 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
doubt and the learned trial court while passing the impugned judgment of the 
appellant's conviction, had erred in law and facts of the case, which 
warranted interference by this Court. 
 
11. 
 
On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General 
contended that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a shadow of 
doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned Deputy Prosecutor 
General further submitted that there was no untoward delay in lodging the 
FIR. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General further submitted that it was a 
heinous offence and exploited the victim's future by the appellant at the 
expense of his lust; that the victim was a child and it could not be expected 
from her to put her future at stake for any reason to falsely implicate the 
appellant in this case for nothing; that delay in reporting the matter to the 
police had no adverse effect on the fate of the prosecution case because in 
the cases where family honour was involved, immediate rushing to the 
police station for lodging the crime report and putting the honour at stake, 
was always difficult for anybody; that the medical evidence provided further 
corroboration to the ocular account; that the impugned judgment entailing 
the conviction and sentence of the appellant did not warrant interference by 
this Court. Lastly, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General prayed for the 
rejection of the appeal. 
 
12. 
 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General and with their assistance perused the record and 
evidence recorded during the trial carefully. 

7 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
13. 
 
The learned counsel for the appellant has laid great stress on the 
reliability of the victim's testimony, the prosecution witness namely Mst. 
Shakeela Bibi (PW-3), because, as argued by him, she was a child witness 
and could have been tutored or influenced by elders. The learned counsel for 
the appellant has strenuously argued that it would not be safe to rely on the 
child witness’s testimony. By now, the law relating to the competence of the 
child witness to depose in a criminal case and its evidentiary value is well 
settled. It would, therefore, be relevant to discuss the precedent law in this 
regard. Article 3 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 contemplates that all 
persons are competent to testify unless the court considers that they are 
prevented from understanding the questions put to them or from giving 
rational answers to those questions, by tender or extreme old age, disease, 
whether of body or mind or any other cause of the same nature. For a child 
witness, normally the courts conduct "vior dire test" under which the court 
before examination puts certain preliminary questions to the child, which 
bear no connection with the case so as to judge the child's competency and 
understanding.  If the child is capable of answering those questions properly 
and deposes in a smart manner, then the child is considered as a competent 
witness. A child is fully competent to depose before a court of law subject to 
his/her capacity and intellect to understand what he/she deposes about. 
Whether a child is a competent witness or not and whether he/she passes the 
'rationality test' is something which is to be decided by the court in 
accordance with Article 3 read with Article 17 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 
after carrying out the voir dire test. The term Voir Dire has been defined in 
various lexicons as under: 
  According to Black's Law dictionary, voir dire connotes: 

8 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
       "A preliminary examination to test the competence of a witness or evidence" 
       According to Webster's Unabridged Dictionary: 
       "An oath administered to a proposed witness or juror by which he or she is 
sworn to speak the truth in an examination to ascertain his or her competence." 
       According to Advance Law Lexicon 
       A rule requiring that a party must call the best evidence that the nature of 
case will allow. 
       According to Advance Law Lexicon 
       A special form of oath administered to a witness whose competency to give 
evidence in the particular matter before the Court is in question, or who is to be 
examined as to some other collateral matter. 
 
Voir dire is an inquiry within a trial to decide relevant ancillary issues which 
are material for the just decision of that trial. In the case titled "Muhammad 
Jamal and others v. The State" (1997 SCMR 1595), the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan found the child witness's testimony as inspiring and 
credible and upheld the conviction because it was supported by medical 
evidence. In the case titled "Mst. Razia alias Jia v. The State" (2009 SCMR 
1428), the august Supreme Court of Pakistan upheld the conviction handed 
down, inter alia, on the basis of ocular testimony of two child witnesses. The 
apex Court had observed that the trial Court had taken all possible and due 
steps to judge the level of intelligence and maturity of the child witnesses 
before recording their statements because they had given consistent accounts 
of the occurrence and the participation of their mother, i.e. the convicted 
accused. It was further observed that this ocular evidence had derived 
strength and corroboration from other evidence. The august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan, exercising its Shariat appellate jurisdiction, has observed and 

9 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
held in the case titled "Fayyaz alias Fayyazi and another v. The State" (2006 
SCMR 1042) as follows:- 
"It has also been rightly observed by the learned Federal Shariat Court that 
conviction could be based on the solitary statement of the victim provided 
the same is capable of implicit reliance and is corroborated by any other.” 
In the case titled "Mushtaq Ahmed and another v. The State" (2007 SCMR 
473), the august Supreme Court of Pakistan, exercising its Shariat appellate 
jurisdiction, has observed and held as follows:- 
"It is consistent view of this Court that in rape cases mere statement, of the 
victim is sufficient to connect the petitioners with the commission of 
offence in case the statement of the victim inspires confidence." 
In the case titled "Ulfat Hussain v. The State" (2010 SCMR 247), the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that although in principle a conviction could 
be based on the testimony of an intelligent and understanding child witness. 
In the case of “Raja Khurram Ali Khan And 2 Others versus Tayyaba Bibi 
and another”( P L D 2020 Supreme Court 146), the august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan has laid down a complete code relating to the recording of the 
statement of a child who himself is a victim and has directed as under: 
“Competence and Evidential Value of a Child Witness 
44. A child, irrespective of his age, is competent to be a witness, 
subject to his fulfilling the conditions precedent provided under 
Articles 3 and 17 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (Order). The 
said provisions read: 
 
"3. Who may testify 
 
All persons shall be competent to testify unless the Court considers that 
they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them, or 
from giving rational answers to those questions, by tender years, 
extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other use of 
the same kind: 
 
Provided that a person shall not be competent to testify if he has been 
convicted by a Court for perjury or giving false evidence: 
 
Provided further that the provisions of the first proviso shall not apply 
to a person about whom the Court is satisfied that he has repented 

10 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
thereafter and mended his ways: 
 
Provided further that the Court shall determine the competence of a 
witness in accordance with the qualification prescribed by the 
Injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah for a 
witness, and, where such witness is not forthcoming the Court may take 
the evidence of a witness who may be available. 
 
Explanation. A lunatic is not incompetent to testify, unless he is 
prevented by his lunacy from understanding the questions put to him 
and giving rational answers to them." 
 
"17. Competence and number of witnesses 
 
(1) The competence of a person to testify and the number of witness 
required in any case shall be determined in accordance with the 
Injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah. 
 
(2) Unless otherwise provided in any law relating to the Enforcement of 
Hudood or any other special law: 
(a) in matters pertaining to financial or future obligations, if reduced to 
writing, the instrument shall be attested by two men, or one man and 
two women, so that one may remind the other, if necessary, and 
evidence shall be led accordingly; and 
(b) in all other matters, the Court may accept, or act on, the testimony of 
one man or one woman, or such other evidence as the circumstances of 
the case may warrant." (emphasis provided) 
45. A close reading of the above provisions reveals that the essential 
conditions for a child, or for that matter any person, to appear and 
testify as a witness, is that the child or the person must have the 
capacity and intelligence of understanding the questions put to him, and 
also be able to rationally respond thereto. This threshold has been 
referred to as passing the "rationality test", and the practice that has 
developed with time in our jurisdiction is for the same to be carried out 
by the presiding Judge prior to recording the evidence of the child 
witness. Moreover, we have noted that in our jurisdiction, the judicial 
acceptance of a child witness, as a safe piece of evidence, has been 
rather hesitant and cautious. This Court in the case of The State through 
Advocate General, Sindh, Karachi v. Farman Hussain and others (PLD 
1995 SC 1), by a majority decision, while dilating upon the competence 
and evidential value of a child witness, opined that: 
 
"Evidence of child witness is a delicate matter and normally it is not 
safe to rely upon it unless corroborated as rule of prudence. Great care 
is to be taken that in the evidence of child element of coaching is not 
involved ... In any case the rule of prudence requires that the testimony 
of child witness should not be relied upon unless it is corroborated by 
some evidence on the record." 
46. In other common law jurisdictions, the Courts are more inter-
active with the child witnesses during the recording of their entire 
evidence. Justice McLachlin, speaking for the Canadian Supreme Court 
in the case of R. v. Marquard [1993] 4 S.C.R. 223, has explained with 
precision the competency of the child witness, by stipulating the 
following criteria for testing the same in terms: 
 
"... (1) the capacity to observe (including interpretation); (2) the 
capacity to recollect; and (3) the capacity to communicate.... The judge 
must satisfy him or herself that the witness possesses these capacities. 
Is the witness capable of observing what was happening? Is he or she 
capable of remembering what he or she observes? Can he or she 

11 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
communicate what he or she remembers? The goal is not to ensure that 
the evidence is credible, but only to assure that it meets the minimum 
threshold of being receivable ……. Generally speaking, the best gauge 
of capacity is the witness's performance at the time of trial….. [T]he 
test outlines the basic abilities that individuals need to possess if they 
are to testify. The threshold is not a high one. What is required is the 
basic ability to perceive, remember and communicate. [once] This 
established, deficiencies of perception, recollection of the events at 
issue may be dealt with as matters going to the weight of the evidence." 
47. Reverting back to our jurisdiction, we note that, unfortunately, 
the standard of appreciating the testimony of a child witness, who is the 
victim of a crime, and the mode and manner of recording his evidence, 
warrants much needed change and innovation, which has been 
witnessed in other jurisdictions. And more particularly, the Courts are 
to appreciate the crucial distinction between a child witness, who is a 
witness to the crime, and one who is himself a victim thereof. 
48. In this regard, we note that the "rationality test", which is 
applied by the presiding Judge at the commencement of the 
examination-in-chief of a child witness, should be made applicable 
throughout the testimony of the child witness. If at any stage, the 
presiding Judge observes any hindrance or reluctance in the narration 
of events, the evidence should be stopped, and remedial measures 
should be taken to ease the stress and anxiety the child witness might 
be under, and if required, the case be adjourned to another date. And 
further, in case the child witness is still unable to narrate his testimony 
with ease, then the presiding Judge ought to record his findings on the 
demeanour of the child witness, conclude his evidence, and relieve him 
as a witness. 
49. In other jurisdictions, we note that great care is taken to ensure 
that such child witnesses are able to depose their testimony at ease, by 
taking measures in the court room to lessen their stress and anxiety of 
court-room appearances in such a tender age. Such measures include 
child witness aid in testifying, screens in court rooms, closed 
courtrooms and counsellor aid before and after recording of evidence, 
which needs to be adopted and practiced in our jurisdiction in cases 
wherein a child victim is to appear as a witness. In this regard, we 
expect the respective governments to take appropriate legislative and 
administrative measures for ensuring the much needed protection and 
facilitation of child witnesses. 
50. As for the presiding trial court judges, they should take 
appropriate steps during the court proceedings to ensure that the child 
witnesses depose their testimony with ease, and that too, in a stress-free 
environment. In cases where the child witness is unable to depose in the 
court room, and his evidence is "necessary" to find the truth, and it has 
a ring of "circumstantial trustworthiness", then courts, as practiced in 
other common law jurisdictions, may consider in appropriate cases, 
allowing out-of-court evidence, as an exception to the "hearsay rule". 
Wigmore, a notable American scholar on the law of evidence, in his 
book Wigmore on Evidence, Volume 5 (Chadbourn rev. 1974), 
identified two considerations, which may serve as an exception to the 
"hearsay rule": "a circumstantial probability of trustworthiness, and a 
necessity for the evidence". 
51. In the Canadian jurisdiction, the Supreme Court in the case of R. 
v. Khan [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, where the appellant, who was a medical 
doctor, was charged with sexually assaulting a three and a half year-old 

12 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
girl, allowed an out-of-court statement of a child witness, as an 
exception to the "hearsay rule", endorsing with approval, the need for 
"truth", as expressed by Wigmore. The extracts of the deliberations on 
the issue are recorded as under: 
 
"The hearsay rule has traditionally been regarded as an absolute rule, 
subject to various categories of exceptions, such as admissions, dying 
declarations, declarations against interest and spontaneous declarations. 
While this approach has provided a degree of certainty to the law on 
hearsay, it has frequently proved unduly inflexible in dealing with new 
situations and new needs in the law. This has resulted in courts in 
recent years on occasion adopting a more flexible approach, rooted in 
the principle and the policy underlying the hearsay rule rather than the 
strictures of traditional exceptions. 
 
"Because of the frequent difficulty of obtaining other evidence and 
because of the lack of reason to doubt many statements children make 
on sexual abuse to others, courts in the United States have moved 
toward relaxing the requirements of admissibility for such statements. 
This has been done in the context of the doctrine of spontaneous 
declarations. In McCormick on Evidence (3rd ed. 1984), at p. 859, n. 
49, the authors refer to this development as the "tender years" 
exception to the general rule, and describe it as follows: 
 
A tendency is apparent in cases of sex offences against children of 
tender years to be less strict with regard to permissible time lapse and 
to the fact that the statement was in response to inquiry." 
 
"Similarly, Wharton's Criminal Evidence (13th ed. 1972), at p.84, 
states that while "[t]he res gestae rule in sex crimes is the same as in 
other criminal actions", the rule "should be applied more liberally in the 
case of children". 
 
"These developments underline the need for increased flexibility in the 
interpretation of the hearsay rule to permit the admission in evidence of 
statements made by children to others about sexual abuse. In so far as 
they are tied to the exception to the hearsay rule of spontaneous 
declarations, however, they suffer from certain defects. There is no 
requirement that resort to the hearsay evidence be necessary. Even 
where the evidence of the child might easily be obtained without undue 
trauma, the Crown would be able to use hearsay evidence... 
 
"The first question should be whether reception of the hearsay 
statement is necessary. Necessity for these purposes must be interpreted 
as "reasonably necessary"... The next question should be whether the 
evidence is reliable. Many considerations such as timing, demeanour, 
the personality of the child, the intelligence and understanding of the 
child, and the absence of any reason to expect fabrication in the 
statement may be relevant on the issue of reliability. 
 
"I conclude that hearsay evidence of a child's statement on crimes 
committed against the child should be received, provided that the 
guarantees of necessity and reliability are met, subject to such 
safeguards as the judge may consider necessary and subject always to 
considerations affecting the weight that should be accorded to such 
evidence. This does not make out-of-court statements by children 
generally admissible; in particular the requirement of necessity will 
probably mean that in most cases children will still be called to give 
viva voce evidence." 
52. Now, reverting back to the facts of the present case, it is noted 
with concern that Tayyaba Bibi, the victim of the crime, was not treated 
with due care and caution during the investigation, and the trial 
proceeding. Tayyaba Bibi, who at the time of being taken into custody 

13 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
by Khalid Mehmood Awan, SHO (PW-16) from the house of convict 
Raja Khurram Ali Khan, was admittedly injured and required medical 
attention, but she was instead subjected to the process of questioning by 
the SHO, which he even video recorded (Ex PW). We further note that 
after her medical treatment at PIMS, Tayyaba Bibi, instead of being 
taken to a child care centre, was subjected to another bout of 
questioning, and this time by Ms. Nisha Ishtiaq, Assistant 
Commissioner, Islamabad (PW7). In these circumstances, it would be 
fair to note that Tayyaba Bibi, during the period in which she rendered 
her statements, was not completely free from pressure and influence of 
the police, local administration and the accused. In this regard, we have 
noted with appreciation that the trial Court applied the "rationality 
test", prior to commencing her examination-in-chief, by recording its 
finding that Tayyaba Bibi was intelligent to understand questions put to 
her, and had the capacity to correctly respond thereto. Thus, her 
testimony during the examination-in-chief can be considered relatively 
free from adverse negative influences. No doubt, during her lengthy 
cross-examination, she wavered from the initial stance she had taken 
during her examination-in-chief, when she was confronted with her 
previous video recorded statement obtained by Khalid Mehmood (PW-
16). However, in view of the findings recorded by the trial Judge, 
regarding her stressed un-natural demeanour during her cross-
examination, the said wavering stance cannot be given the same 
credence, as one may give to any adult witness of a crime. In fact, her 
cross-examination should have been stopped the moment the trial Judge 
noticed her reception of questions and responses thereto lacked 
intelligent rationality, which in fact is an essential attribute of a 
competent witness under Article 3 of the Order. The trial judge then 
surely erred by allowing her cross-examination to continue in her said 
disposition. It appears that the trial Judge wrongly treated Tayyaba Bibi 
to be a child witness of a crime, rather than as a child witness who was 
herself the victim of the crime. This lack of distinction on the part of 
the trial Judge led to his faulty conclusion of completely discarding the 
evidentiary value of her testimony.” 
 
It is, therefore, obvious from the above discussion, that a child witness is not 
barred from entering the witness box. It is the satisfaction of the trial Court, 
which is of crucial importance. A child who also happens to be a victim of 
an offence is competent to testify as a witness, and the deposition would be 
worthy of reliance provided the Court is satisfied that he or she, as the case 
may be, is intelligent and understands the significance of entering the 
witness box. A conviction can also be handed down placing reliance on the 
sole testimony of a child witness. We have gone through the evidence 
recorded by the learned trial court and find that the prosecution witnesses, in 
a consistent and forthright manner gave evidence proving that the appellant 

14 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
had raped the prosecution witness namely Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3). All 
the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Zafar (PW-1), Zahoor Ahmed 
(PW-2) and Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3) consistently corroborated the 
version adopted by each other and after careful scrutiny of the statements of 
above said prosecution witnesses, we find that their statements are in line 
with each other on each and every minor as well as material aspect of the 
case and smooth flow of facts is apparent from their depositions. They were 
subjected to cross-examination by the defence, but without extracting 
anything beneficial for the appellant.  
 
14. 
The statement of the prosecution witness namely Mst. Shakeela Bibi 
was further supported by Dr. Hina Siddiqui, (PW-9), who on 07.07.2021 
was posted as a Woman Medical Officer at RHC Pacca Laran, District 
Rahim Yar Khan and on the same day, conducted the medical examination 
of the victim namely Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3). Dr. Hina Siddiqui, (PW-9), 
after examining Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3), observed Swelling at introitus. A 
bruise extending from 4-7'0 clock position at the vaginal orifice and a ruptured hymen. 
Dr. Hina Siddiqui, (PW-9) also observed the trouser worn by the victim 
namely Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3) at the time of her examination was also 
stained with blood.  
 
15. 
 
It was contented by the learned counsel for the appellant that 
there was a delay in lodging of the F.I.R which could cause serious doubt in 
the prudent mind about the implication of the accused for an ulterior motive. 
In this case, the occurrence of subjecting the minor girl Mst. Shakeela Bibi 
(PW-3) to rape had taken place at 10:00 p.m., on 24.06.2021 and the matter 

15 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
was reported on 26.06.2021, despite the fact that the modesty of a minor girl 
was violated by rape. The apprehension of the victim and her family in 
approaching the police immediately is quite understandable in the 
circumstances. Delay in reporting the crime to the police in respect of an 
offence involving a person's honour and reputation and which society may 
view unsympathetically could play on the minds of a victim and her family 
and deter them from going to the police. Therefore, in such a situation it is 
very obvious that even if the report has been lodged with a delay, it will not 
bring complications and otherwise not beneficial for an accused who has 
been charged with the offence the punishment of which would entail to the 
death penalty or imprisonment for life. In the case titled “Zahid and another 
v. The State” (2020 SCMR 590), the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
observed and held as follows:- 
  "Undoubtedly, the FIR was registered after a day of the crime having 
been committed, however, the fact that the modesty of a married woman 
was violated by sexual assault makes understandable the apprehension of 
the victim and her family in approaching the police immediately. Delay in 
reporting the crime to the police in respect of an offence involving a 
person's honour and reputation and which society may view 
unsympathetically could prey on the minds of a victim and her family and 
deter them to go to the police. In the case of Hamid Khan v. State a delay 
of three days in reporting the crime to the police was considered 
immaterial". 
 
16.  
The learned counsel for the appellant has also laid much emphasis on 
the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, according to 
which no seminal material was detected on the items sent to it for analysis. It 
has already been mentioned that according to the statement of Dr. Hina 

16 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
Siddiqui (PW-9), at the time of the examination of the victim namely Mst. 
Shakeela Bibi (PW-3), the Woman Medical Officer had observed a ruptured 
hymen and a bruise extending from the 4 o’clock position to the 7 o'clock 
position at the vaginal orifice and this fact itself proves the penetration. The 
penetration having been established, we do not think that such DNA testing 
was required under the circumstances. Moreover, DNA testing is not a 
requirement of the law. In this regard reliance is placed on the case titled 
“Farooq Ahmed v. The State” (PLD 2020 SC 313), wherein the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed and held as under:- 
     "7. 
The rape having being established, was it then necessary to 
conduct a DNA test to determine that the semen retrieved from the 
victim's body and shalwar was of the petitioner. We do not think that 
such DNA testing was required under the circumstances. Moreover, 
DNA testing is not a requirement of law. In Shakeel's case (above) it 
was held (in paragraph 9), that: 
 It is well-established by now that "omission of scientific test of semen 
status and grouping of sperms is neglect on the part of prosecution 
which cannot materially affect the other evidence." In this regard we are 
fortified by the dictum as laid down in case titled Haji Ahmad v. State 
(1975 SCMR 69)... 
 In the above cited case of Haji Ahmad v. State (1975 SCMR 69) the 
father had raped his step-daughter and his conviction was sustained by 
this Court in the absence of a DNA test; the Trial Court had relied on the 
girl's testimony, chemical examiner's report confirming existence of 
semen on vaginal swabs taken from her and the medico-legal report 
showing her to have been sexually molested. Similarly, this Court in the 
case of Irfan Ali Sher v. State (Jail Petition No. 324/2019, decided on 17 
April 2020) upheld a conviction under section 376 PPC in the absence 
of a DNA test. Rejecting the petitioner's argument that 'DNA report was 
not sought' this Court held (in paragraph 3), that: 
 As regards the semen not being sent for DNA forensic determination 
with a view to link it with the perpetrator is not a requirement of law. 
 It is also not desirable that we should impose additional conditions to 
prove a charge of rape, or of attempted rape, and to do so would be a 
disservice to victims, which may also have the effect of enabling 
predators and perpetrators. However, there may be cases where an 
accused's DNA is retrieved for forensic determination to establish his 
guilt.” 
 
17. 
 
We have also noted that according to the statement of the 
prosecution witness namely Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3), she was aged about 

17 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
14/15 years at the time of the incident and according to Dr. Hina Siddiqui 
(PW-9), the age of the prosecution witness namely Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-
3) was about 13/14 years old on the day of her examination on 07.07.2021. 
No challenge was thrown to the age of the victim namely Mst. Shakeela Bibi 
(PW-3), therefore, on proving the allegation of rape against the appellant, 
the learned trial court rightly convicted the appellant under section 376(3) 
P.P.C.  
 
18.             So far as the contention raised by the learned counsel for the 
appellant that the learned trial court while disbelieving the same evidence 
has acquitted Kareem Bakhsh son of Allah Dewaya and Muhammad Imran 
son of Wazir Ahmed  and the conviction awarded to the appellant on the 
basis of same evidence is not justified, is concerned, we have observed that 
the learned trial court has rightly acquitted the said co-accused of the 
appellant. The prosecution witness namely Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3) did 
not state that Kareem Bakhsh son of Allah Dewaya and Muhammad Imran 
son of Wazir Ahmed, the co-accused of the appellant, since acquitted, had 
also raped her. During the course of the trial the prosecution witness namely 
Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3) was specifically questioned with regard to her 
statement that it was only the appellant namely Sajjad Ahmed who had 
raped her. Moreover, we, keeping in view the prevailing social trend that 
innocent people of the family or friends of the main culprit are implicated 
falsely to incapacitate them to pursue the case of the actual culprit, are of the 
opinion that Kareem Bakhsh son of Allah Dewaya and Muhammad Imran 
son of Wazir Ahmed ( since acquitted), the co-accused of the appellant, 
indeed had a case distinguishable from the appellant namely Sajjad Ahmed .

Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
 
19.      
In all criminal cases, normal discrepancies are bound to occur 
in the depositions of witnesses due to normal errors of observation, namely, 
errors of memory due to lapse of time or due to mental disposition such as 
shock and horror at the time of occurrence. Where the omissions amount to a 
contradiction, creating serious doubt about the truthfulness of the witness 
and other witnesses also make material improvement while deposing in the 
court, such evidence cannot be safe to rely upon. However, minor 
contradictions, inconsistencies, embellishments or improvements on trivial 
matters which do not affect the core of the prosecution case, should not be 
made a ground on which the evidence can be rejected in its entirety. The 
court has to form its opinion about the credibility of the witness and record a 
finding as to whether his deposition inspires confidence. Exaggerations per 
se do not render the evidence brittle. But it can be one of the factors to test 
the credibility of the prosecution version when the entire evidence is put in a 
crucible for being tested on the touchstone of credibility. Therefore, mere 
marginal variations in the statements of a witness cannot be dubbed as 
improvements as the same may be elaborations of the statement made by the 
witness earlier. The omissions which amount to contradictions in material 
particulars i.e. go to the root of the case/materially affect the trial or core of 
the prosecution's case, render the testimony of the witness liable to be 
discredited but not otherwise. In the instant case, we find that the 
prosecution witness namely Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3) has successfully 
evidenced her credibility, therefore, the learned trial court was quite justified 
to rely on her while finding the appellant guilty. 
 

19 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
20.         As mentioned above, the prosecution witness namely Mst. Shakeela 
Bibi (PW-3) was cross-examined by the learned Counsel for the appellant, 
but her evidence relating to the fact of her being raped by the appellant has 
not been shaken at all. It is fully established by the statements of the 
prosecution witness namely Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3) that the appellant 
raped her. The statements of Muhammad Zafar (PW-1) and Zahoor Ahmed 
(PW-2) against the appellant are a corroborative piece of evidence which 
lends assurance to the statement of the prosecution witness namely Mst. 
Shakeela Bibi (PW-3). There is material on the record to show that the 
appellant raped the prosecution witness namely Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-3). 
The intention of the accused is the basis and the gravamen of an offence 
under section 376 P.P.C. Consequently, we have no hesitation in holding 
that the learned trial court rightly convicted the appellant for the offence 
punishable under section 376 (3) P.P.C. 
 
21. 
 
We have also examined the defence pleas taken by the appellant 
namely Sajjad Ahmad during the trial. The appellant namely Sajjad Ahmad 
claimed that he was involved in the case without any reason. The plea taken 
by the appellant namely Sajjad Ahmad is not appealable to the prudent mind 
as without suggesting any ill-will to the prosecution witnesses, it was not 
possible to allege rape against the appellant, without any rhyme or reason. 
 
22.    
In the light of the above discussion, the conviction and sentence 
of the appellant namely Sajjad Ahmad son of Kareem Bakhsh, as awarded 
by the learned trial Court through the abovementioned judgment, are 

20 
Crl. Appeal No.124-j of 2023  
maintained and upheld and the Criminal Appeal No.124-J of 2023 lodged by 
the appellant, is hereby dismissed.
