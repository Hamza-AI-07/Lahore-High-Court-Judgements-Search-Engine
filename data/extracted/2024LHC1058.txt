13.03.2024. Mr. Fazal Abbas Kamyana, Advocate for the petitioner.  
 
Through instant criminal revision, Muhammad Musharaf Hassan, the 
petitioner, has prayed for setting aside the order dated 09.01.2024 passed 
by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lalian, District Chiniot, whereby 
the respondent No.2 was not summoned by the learned Additional Sessions 
Judge to face trial in a private complaint filed by the petitioner under 
sections 500, 501, 34 PPC against the respondents Nos.2 & 3.  
2. 
The petitioner/complainant filed a private complaint against 
respondents No.2 & 3 with the allegation that respondent No.3, Abid 
Hassan, is the real brother of the petitioner, who filed suit for declaration 
titled “Abid Hassan. Vs. Muhammad Musharaf Hassan, etc.” on 
17.04.2021 before the Senior Civil Judge, Chiniot, which was entrusted to 
Mr. Muhammad Tariq Khan, Civil Judge 1st Class, Lalian by using 
defamatory language against the petitioner. The learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Lalian, after recording cursory evidence of the petitioner 
through an impugned order dated 09.01.2024, summoned respondent No.3, 
but respondent No.2 was not summoned. Being aggrieved by the order of 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lalian, dated 09.01.2024, the petitioner 
has filed the instant petition.  
3. 
Heard. Record perused.  
4. 
The record placed on the file reveals that respondent No.2 filed suit 
for a declaration titled “Abid Hassan. Vs. Muhammad Musharaf Hassan, 
etc.” on behalf of respondent No.3. It is an admitted fact that respondent 
No. 2 is a practicing advocate, and during his professional activities, he 
drafted a plaint on the instructions of his client. Any pleading that a counsel

draft is purely based on the client's instructions. His client verifies the truth 
of the contents of the pleading. The concerned advocate merely signs at the 
bottom of the pleading to identify the client. Respondent No. 2 is not the 
plaintiff of the suit for declaration, and he has acted purely based on the 
instructions given to him by his client. If the petitioner's allegations are 
accepted, then a situation would arise where no advocate can draft any 
pleading on the client's instructions out of fright of being leveled as a 
person making a defamatory statement. Respondent No. 2 cannot be trialed 
when a prima facie case is not made out to prosecute him. The learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Lalian, has rightly concluded that respondent 
No.2 has acted merely as counsel of respondent No.3. He cannot be held 
responsible for any derogatory allegations levelled in the plaint of 
respondent No.3. There is no malice, and even otherwise respondent No. 2 has 
acted in good faith and would be protected by Exception 9 to Section 500 of 
P.P.C. In the totality of facts & circumstances, the trial Judge correctly did 
not summon respondent No.2 as accused to face the trial along with his 
other co-accused. From the contents of the petition, the petitioner did not 
point out any reason, much less compelling, to interfere in the impugned 
order. This means that the trial judge has recorded the cogent grounds. 
Such order, containing valid reasons, cannot be interfered with by this 
Court in the exercise of limited revisional jurisdiction under sections 435, 
439 Cr.P.C., unless and until the same is illegal, perverse, and without 
jurisdiction. Since this court has observed no such patent illegality or legal 
infirmity, the impugned order dated 09-01-2024 deserves to be and is 
hereby maintained in the obtaining circumstances of the case. 
5.  
The upshot of the above discussion is that the instant petition is 
without substance and is hereby dismissed.
