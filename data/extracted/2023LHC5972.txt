Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:- Through this single judgment 
I intend to decide the titled appeal [F.A.O No.80183/2021] as 
well as F.A.O No.80268/2021 and F.A.O No.69092/2022 as 
common questions of law and facts are involved in these cases. 
2. 
Through these appeals under Section 7(3)(d) of Federal 
Public Service Commission Ordinance, 1977 the appellants have 
challenged the validity of Memorandums dated 15.10.2021 
whereby the Federal Public Service Commission rejected the 
representation of the appellants and Memorandums on 
26.11.2021 whereby the review filed by the appellants were 
rejected by the Federal Public Service Commission.  
3. 
Brief facts of the case are that the Federal Public Service 
Commission [hereinafter referred to as the “FPSC”] through 
advertisement invited applications from the aspirant  candidates 
for post of BS-17 against total 166 seats out of which 105 seats

are of open merit, 13 seats of women quota and 48 seats for 
minority quota through CSS Competitive Examination falling the 
year 2020. The appellants Usama Bin Maalik, Awais Ahmad Brar 
and Kamran Ahmad Dev participated in the examination, passed 
the test and interview, physical and psychological as well as viva 
voce test and accordingly they were placed at Sr. No.161, 165 
and 163 of the merit list among the total 364 successful 
candidates. But the FPSC instead of issuing appointment offer to 
the appellants, appointed four women from Punjab Quota who 
were below merit list falling at Sr. No.167, 170, 171 & 172. 
Besides above, two selected candidates at Sr. No.88 & 140 did 
not join the service thus further two seats of Punjab Open Merit 
remained vacant which were also filled by appointing female 
candidates falling at Sr. No.177 & 178 of the merit list. The 
appellants being dissatisfied with above modus of appointment, 
filed representations which were rejected by the competent 
authority (FPSC) vide Memorandums dated 15.10.2021, 
15.10.2011 & 08.09.2022, respectively on the basis of order 
dated 03.06.2010 passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
Civil Petition No.941 of 2010 titled as Federal Public Service 
Commission etc. Vs. Nergis Shazia Chaudhry. Against the above 
decision, the appellants preferred review petitions which were 
also rejected by the authority vide Memorandums dated 
26.11.2021, 26.11.2022 & 04.10.2022 respectively. Hence, these 
appeals. 
4. 
I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have 
gone through the record. 
5. 
The FPSC conducted CSS Competitive Examination-2020 
[hereinafter referred to as “Examination”] and after completion of 
the recruitment process through Press Note dated 05.05.2021 
announced the number of vacancies, including carried over

As per order of the merit list the appellants’ names were reflected 
at Sr. No.161, 165 and 163, respectively of the merit among 364 
qualified candidates and last in serial recommendee was picked 
from Sr. No.151 of the merit list. In the Memorandum dated 
22.05.2007, the Federal Government across the board allocated 
10% quota to Women and under paragraph No.3(i) whereof the 
said percentage/allocation does not apply to the vacancies 
reserved for recruitment on the basis of open merit. For ready 
reference, paragraph No.3 (i) of Memorandum dated 22.05.2007 
is as under:- 
The percentage of vacancies reserved for recruitment on the 
basis of merit; 
Out of the successful candidates of Punjab Quota, 13 female 
candidates were to be selected under Women Quota, whereas 
during scrutiny of the criteria, 11 female candidates secured 
higher marks and fell within the Open Merit Quota therefore 
these 11 women candidates who secured a higher position in the 
Open Merit were adjusted/upgraded in higher group compared to a 

 
F.A.O No.80183/2021 
 
4
lower group in the Open merit. Due to this adjustment, as the 
aforesaid 11 female candidates who secured higher marks were 
adjusted in the Open Merit Quota. As 11 seats of successful 
women on merit were fell vacant in a lower group of women 
Quota which seats were then transferred to Women Quota by the 
FPSC while relying upon an order dated 03.06.2010 passed by 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Civil Petition No.941 of 2010. 
Under paragraph No.2 of the advertisement for Examination, the 
number of vacancies to be filled on the final result of CSS as per 
the aforementioned schedule. Total 105 vacancies were reserved 
for Punjab Open Merit and last recommended candidate was 
picked from Sr. No.151 of the Merit List whereas all the 
appellants fell below to the above said serial i.e. at Sr. No.161, 
163 and 165, respectively.  
6.  
Further, as per the record, 13 female candidates were to be 
picked from the successful candidates in Women Quota. Eleven 
(11) women candidates secured higher marks and fell within the 
Open Merit list i.e. within Sr. No.151, the detail whereof is as

7.  
It would be beneficial to have a glance on an identical 
matter of one, Mst. Nergis Shazia Chaudhry who participated in 
the Examination but despite qualifying the test, interview etc., 
she was not recommended for the appointment. Against the 
above non-recommendation, her representation was dismissed by 
the FPSC and the said order was assailed before this Court 
through F.A.O No.1/2010, which was allowed vide reported 
judgment titled as Nergis Shazia Chaudhry Vs. Federal Public 
Service Commission and others [2010 PLC (C.S.) 1035] on the 
ground that said lady be appointed/adjusted against the Women 
Quota as she has successfully qualified the Examination. The said 
order was challenged by the FPSC before the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan through Civil Petition No.941 of 2010 which was 
dismissed by the Apex Court vide order dated 03.06.2010 with 
the following observation:  
“4. It is to be noted that as far as the criteria laid down in the 
above rules are concerned those are not coming in the way of 
respondent since she had also passed her examination and was 
amongst those who had qualified to be considered against 
reserved seats for females as per criteria. Problem started when 
she was not accommodated and instead a female candidate 
from general/open seats preferred for DMG group on account 
of her higher merit, statedly, was accommodated against a seat 
available in similar group in reserved quota for females and in 
open merit seats a male candidate was accommodated. 
Actually it should have been other way round, such as, to 
recognize the higher merit of female candidate she must have 
been accommodated against the seat meant for DMG group in 
a reserved quota but, at the same time the seat which, statedly, 
fell vacant in next available group in open merit on account of 
her adjustment should have been transferred to the female 
quota to ensure availability of 19 vacancies in order to achieve 
the objective of reserved quota. It is, thus, evident that by 
changing the form, in essence, the substance was changed with 
the result that on one hand a male candidate was 

 
F.A.O No.80183/2021 
 
7
accommodated in open merit seats and on the other a seat of 
females in reserved quota was cut down. The learned High 
Court, therefore, having taken into consideration these aspects 
of the case as well as the rules which have been heavily relied 
by the learned counsel for the petitioner had rightly granted the 
writ in favour of the respondent.” 
The view rendered in the judgment (supra) was reiterated by the 
Apex Court in a judgment titled as Abdullah Nawaz Cheema Vs. 
Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC), Islamabad and 
another (2019 SCMR 622) the relevant portion whereof is 
reproduced as under: 
 “8…. A a result of the above, if a female candidate secures 
sufficient merit to be allocated a group on the Open Merit, she 
may opt for a better group, if that is available in the Women 
Quota. Once she has opted for a better group, the one she had 
previously been allocated in Open Merit will be left vacant. 
This vacant group  seat is then transferred to the Women 
Quota which was short a seat when the cndidate had opted for 
the then available better seat. This allows for there to be a 
constant number of reserved seats in the Women Quota 
without depriving Femal Candidates, higher on the merit list, 
better group seats. 
9.   The submission of the Petitioner that the vacated seats 
ought to be allocated to available candidates is misconceived. 
It ignores the fact that this Court held in the aforementioned 
case, that male candidates otherwise not qualifying for 
allocation on open merit cannot be givn the benefit of 
allocation in the result of upgradation permissible to Open 
Merit female candidates. As the record shows, the Petitioner 
secured a Merit Position of 673 whereas the Merit closed at 
661. Irrespective of the quota seats, he could not be allocated 
to any group considering his merit position.” 
 
The FPSC adjusted the women candidates from open merit list in 
the light of the judgments (supra) passed by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan and compliance of the said decisions is mandatory for 
all the organs of the state as enshrined in Article 189 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Reliance in this 
regard is placed on the cases cited as Muhammad Sharif Vs. 
Settlement Commissioner and others (2007 SCMR 707), Iffat 
Jabeen Vs. District Education Officer (M.E.E), Lahore and 

 
F.A.O No.80183/2021 
 
8
another (2011 SCMR 437) and Dr. Iqrar Ahmad Khan Vs. Dr. 
Muhammad Ashraf and others (2021 SCMR 1509).    
8.  
The appellants were the competitors against 105 seats 
reserved for Open Merit. The last allocated candidate against the 
Open Merit quota stood at merit position No.151 as per final 
merit list whereas the appellants stood at Sr. No.161, 163 and 
165, respectively, therefore they were not recommended for 
selection by the FPSC. As the appellants were below in merit, 
thus were not recommended for appointment as such no 
perversity or illegality has been committed and decision of the 
FPSC does not require any interference by this Court. Reliance is 
placed on the case titled as Mushtaq Ahmad Mohal and others v. 
The Honourable Lahore High Court, Lahore and others (1997 
SCMR 1043) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan in a such 
like matter has held as under: 
“14. The above contention is unfounded. It is an 
admitted position that the petitioners were below in the 
merit list from the above 24 candidates who were 
selected on zonal basis.” 
 
Another reliance in placed on case cited as Syed Ali Iqbal 
Hussain v. District Sessions Judge, Bahawalpur and others (2018 
SCMR 1009), wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as 
under: 
“8.   We have also examined the record ourselves, gone 
through the merit list and found that the petitioner had indeed 
been granted an undue favour which was in violation of the 
merit policy. The argument of the learned counsel that since 
none of the candidates, who had secured higher marks, had 
challenged the merit list, the appointment of the petitioner had 
somehow attained legitimacy is ex facie misconceived. Where 
an apparent illegality or impropriety had come before the High 
Court it could not have shut its eyes and looked the other way. 
It ought to have, and rightly took cognizance of the matter and  
passed an appropriate order.”  
 

 
F.A.O No.80183/2021

Furthermore, the suitability/eligibility of a candidate for 
appointment against a post falls within the exclusive domain of 
an 
Appointing 
Authority/Selection 
Committee, 
who 
are 
considered the best evaluator/judge on the field. The Supreme 
Court of Pakistan on the same point in a case reported as Arshad 
Ali Tabassum Vs. The Registrar Lahore High Court, Lahore 
(2015 SCMR 112) has held as under:- 
“7.     As far as the contention of the petitioner that he was not 
recommended for appointment by the committee due to the malice 
on the part of the members of the Interview Committee for the 
reason that his services were terminated as Civil Judge on the 
charge of misconduct, is concerned, suffice it to observe that 
according to the established principle of law this Court cannot 
substitute opinion of the Interview Committee on the bald allegation 
after losing the chance in the interview. Reference is made to the 
case of Asif Mahmood Chughtai, Advocate and 17 Others v. 
Government of Punjab through Chief Secretary & others (2000 
SCMR 966), Dr. Mir Alam Jan v. Dr. Muhammad Shahzad & 
Others (2008 SCMR 960) and Muhammad Ashraf Sangri v. 
Federation of Pakistan & Others (2014 SCMR 157). In such 
circumstances, the petitioner could not establish any malice on the 
part of the Interview Committee. There is also no measuring 
apparatus with this Court to determine that the petitioner was 
deferred in the interview by the Interview Committee only for the 
sole reason of his misconduct as Civil Judge. It is presumed that the 
Interview Committee must have given the petitioner marks after 
judging his ability without being influenced by the earlier 
misconduct of the petitioner as the Interview Committee was not 
acting as Disciplinary Committee dealing with the misconduct of 
the petitioner. Since the petitioner could not fulfil the requisite 
criteria for the post of Additional District & Sessions Judge, 
therefore, he was not recommended for appointment by the 
Selection Committee, thus, no illegality has been committed by the 
respondent while acting on the recommendations of the 
Examination Committee warranting interference by this Court in its 
constitutional jurisdiction.”      
 
Reliance is also placed on a case cited as Nisar Ahmed Mehar v. 
Province of Sindh through Chief Secretary Sindh and 5 others 
[2019 PLC (C.S.) 660], relevant portion whereof is reproduced 
as under:  

 
F.A.O No.80183/2021 
 
10
“21. In Service matters, the suitability of a candidate for 
appointment, exclusively falls within the domain of appointing 
authority. Such authority, in our view, cannot be compelled to make 
appointment without fulfilling the requisite formalities by a 
candidate. In the case in hand, the petitioner, on the face of record, 
has failed to establish any legal right which can be enforced under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973.”  
 
The FPSC while dismissing the review of the appellant [Usama 
Bin Maalik] after discussing the contentions raised by the 
appellants observed as under: 
 “Allocation for CE-2020 was made strictly in accordance with the 
judgment of Lahore High Court in F.A.O No.01/2010 upheld by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in C.P. No.941/2010. As far as your 
contention regarding amendment in memorandum for provision of 
10% women quota, it may be observed that Courts have directed 
implementation of women quota in letter and spirit. Accordingly, 
women were to be considered for open merit as well as reserved 
quota. Thereafter, there were 105 open merit seats against Punjab 
quota. The last candidate allocated from Punjab against open merit 
seat was merit 147. Your merit position was 161. Therefore, in 
terms of judgment, referred to above it was not possible to allocate 
you against open merit seats of Punjab.” 
 
9. 
Learned counsels for the appellants could not point out 
any mala fide on behalf of the FPSC for non-selection of the 
appellants and also could not point out any illegality, irregularity 
or jurisdictional defect in the impugned orders of the FPSC while 
dismissing the representations as well as reviews of the 
appellants.  
10.  
Resultantly, all these appeals being devoid of any merits 
are hereby dismissed.
