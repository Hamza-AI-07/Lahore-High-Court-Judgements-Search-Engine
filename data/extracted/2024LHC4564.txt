    16.10.2024 
Petitioners by: 
               Ghulam Fareed Sanotra, Advocate. 
 
Respondents No.1 to 4 by:     Syed Tahir Abbas & Ch.Zahid Imran,   
                                             Advocates.   
 
AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J. Through this civil revision 
the petitioners have assailed the vires of judgments/orders of the 
courts below whereby application of respondent No.1 (Saif-ur-Rehman) 
for making the „Award‟ as rule of the court, was allowed, 
concurrently.  
2. 
 
Facts in brevity are that Syed Jaffer Hussain, respondent 
No.2/ predecessor of petitioner No.1 and respondents No.2(i,a) & 
2(ii, a) (hereinafter referred to as „respondent No.2‟) agreed to sell his 
house bearing No.4-S-21, Block No.12, Sargodha situated in Khasra 
No.18/2/1 measuring 01 Marla 01 square foot and upper portion of 
Khasra No.18/2/2, 18/2/3, 18/2/4 measuring 37x21 feet (hereinafter 
referred to as „suit house‟) to respondent No.1 (hereinafter referred to as 
respondent No.1) and received Rs.5000/- as an earnest money however, 
the price of the suit house was not settled as the suit house had not 
formally transferred to him, therefore, they settled that after 
conclusion of the case, resolution of the dispute and sanction of 
mutation in  his (respondent No.2) favour, registered sale deed will 
be executed in favour of respondent No.1 and they will also settle the 
price of the suit house at that time. However, they failed to settle the 
price of the suit house amicably and through an agreement dated 
03.06.1982 appointed respondent No.3 (Syed Kazim Hussain) and Syed 
Shabbir Hussain as arbitrators on behalf of respondent No.2 (Syed 
Jaffer Hussain) whereas respondent No.4 (Malik Muhammad Anwar) and 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
2
respondent No.5 (Jahangir Sarwar Sheikh) were appointed as arbitrators 
on behalf of respondent No.1 (Saif-ur-Rehman). Despite their efforts, 
said arbitrators could not succeed to give their arbitration 
decision/award, as a result of which, respondent No.1 filed an 
application under Sections 11 & 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 
(hereinafter referred to as „Act, 1940‟) before the Civil Court at Sargodha 
for removal of the arbitrators appointed by respondent No.2 and also 
sought a direction to the arbitrators to pass arbitration decision/award. 
During the proceedings of said application, parties (respondents No.1 & 2)  
of the arbitration agreement dated 03.06.1982 agreed to appoint 
Malik Mehar Ali, the then Naib Tehsildar as their „Umpire‟. 
Learned trial court with the consensus and concurrence of the parties 
appointed aforesaid Naib Tehsildar as their Umpire and directed him 
to submit arbitration decision in the court who, in compliance of said 
direction passed arbitration decision/award on 07.09.1983 and 
submitted the same in a sealed envelope to the court. The learned 
trial court found that the Umpire had written down the award on a 
judicial paper instead of stamp paper, therefore, directed him to 
reduce the said decision/award in verbatim on a stamp paper. In 
compliance of it he submitted the arbitration decision/award dated 
26.02.1984 to the Court on 28.02.1984. In the light of said arbitration 
decision/award, respondent No.1 while withdrawing his earlier 
application under Section 11 & 20 of the Act, 1940 moved an 
application under Sections 14/17 of the Act, 1940 for making the 
said decision/award as rule of the court. On the other hand, 
respondent No.2 (Syed Jaffer Hussain) resisted the application by 
filing contesting written reply wherein he raised certain objections 
upon the award to the effect that the same is just a report which 
cannot be made rule of the Court; that the award is barred by time; 
that the award is collusive between respondent No.1 and the Umpire; 
that the evidence produced by him was brushed aside unilaterally by 
the Umpire; that he never received Rs.5000/-; that the award is result 
of misconduct and prayed for dismissal of the application for making 
award rule of the Court. Respondent No.2 also moved separate 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
3
objection petition on the award by making similar type of objections 
and prayed for setting aside of the award. Respondent No.1 filed its 
reply. 
  Later on, Syed Jaffer Hussain sold a part of the suit house to 
petitioner No.2 (Syed Sajjad Haider) and petitioner No.3 (Syed Iftikhar 
Hussain represented by his LRs (3(i) to 3(vi)) for a consideration of 
Rs.1,50,000/- through registered sale deed No.1392 dated 
08.07.1984. Subsequent, purchasers moved an application for their 
impleadment in the case and they were impleaded as party in the 
array of respondents as respondents No.7 & 8 (herein after referred 
to as petitioners No.2 & 3). They also filed objection petition upon 
the award. Learned trial court in the light of divergent stances taken 
by the parties framed necessary issues and invited the parties to 
produce their respective evidence. After recording evidence of the 
parties pro & contra, oral as well as documentary allowed the 
application in the following terms: 
“Relief 
      As a consequence of what has been discussed above, the 
award of the umpire dated 07.09.1983/26.02.1984 is made 
rule of the court subject to deposit of Rs.10,00,000/- within a 
period of two months by the petitioner for onward payment to 
the subsequent purchasers/contesting respondents during the 
pendency of the proceedings failing which the award shall be 
deemed to have been turned down. There is no order as to 
costs....” 
 
 
Feeling aggrieved, the petitioners preferred an appeal which 
was dismissed vide judgment dated 28.02.2015. Being dis-satisfied, 
they filed the instant civil revision.  
3.            I have heard learned counsel for the parties at full length 
and perused the record with their able assistance. 
4. 
 
Respondent No.2 filed written reply of the respondent 
No.1‟s application for making award rule of the Court on 24.03.1984, 
whereas he also filed objection petition upon the award on 
08.10.1984. Petitioners No.2 & 3 also filed their independent 
objection petition on 08.10.1984. Respondent No.1 filed contested 
written reply on 28.10.1984. Perusal of the objections raised by the 
petitioners and respondent No.2 it appears that they questioned the 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
4
partiality and alleged misconduct of the Umpire with regard to giving 
the award. 
5. 
    
Section 30 of the Act, 1940 provides that an award can 
be challenged on the grounds that arbitrator or Umpire has 
misconducted himself or the proceedings; secondly, the award has 
been made after the issue of an order by the Court superseding the 
arbitration or after arbitration proceedings have become invalid 
under Section 35 of the Act ibid; thirdly, the award has been 
improperly 
produced 
or 
is 
otherwise 
invalid. 
For 
better 
understanding the aforesaid Section 30 is reproduced as under:- 
”30. Grounds for setting aside award---An award shall not be 
set aside except on one or more of the following grounds, namely, 
 
(a) 
That an arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself or 
the proceedings; 
 
(b) 
That an award has been made after the issue of an order by 
the Court superseding the arbitration or after arbitration 
proceedings have become invalid under section 35; 
 
(c) 
That an award has been improperly procured or is 
otherwise invalid. 
 
            Bare perusal of said provisions of Section 30, it appears that 
an award can be set aside on the following grounds: - 
 
i) that the arbitrator or Umpire has misconducted himself; 
ii) that the arbitrator or the Umpire misconducted the 
proceedings; 
iii) that the award was made after the arbitration was superseded; 
iv) that the award was made after the proceedings became invalid 
under section 35; 
v) that the award was improperly procured and  
 
vi) that the award was otherwise invalid. 
 
6. 
   
Any party to an arbitration agreement or any person 
claiming under him desiring to challenge the existence or validity of 
an arbitration agreement or an award or to have the effect of either 
determine shall apply to the Court and the Court shall decide the 
question on affidavit. For care Section 33 of the Act, 1904 is 
reproduced as under:- 
“33.Arbitration agreement or award to be contested by application.-Any 
party to an arbitration agreement or any person claiming 
under him desiring to challenge the existence or validity of an 
arbitration agreement or an award or to have the effect of 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
5
either determined shall apply to the Court and the Court shall 
decide the question on affidavit 
Provided that where the Court deems it just and expedient, it 
may set down the application for hearing on other evidence 
also, and it may pass such orders for discovery and 
particulars as it may do in a suit.” 
 
 In this regard Section 33 of the Act, 1940 provides as under: - 
 
 
(i) 
When it is desired to challenge the existence of an 
arbitration agreement or an award; 
(ii) 
When it is desired to challenge their validity; and 
(iii) 
When it is desired to have their effect determine. 
 
 
A person who is party to an arbitration agreement or award 
can challenge its existence or validity either by filing an independent 
application or in the reply submitted to the application filed by other 
side, seeking indulgence of the Court to make the award as rule of 
the Court.  
7. 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan while keeping in 
mind the scope of Sections 30 & 33 of the Act, 1940 observed that 
the Court while examining the award is not supposed to sit as a 
Court of appeal and fish for the latent errors in the arbitration 
proceedings or the award, therefore, the Court cannot undertake 
reappraisal of evidence recorded by the arbitrator in order to discover 
the error or infirmity in the award and in a case titled as “M/s JOINT 
VENTURE KG/RIST through D.P. Giesler G.M. Bongard Strasse 
3,4000, Dusseldorf-30, Federal Republic of Germany, C/o 15-Shah 
Charagh Chambers, Lahore and 2 others vs. FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN, through Secretary Food, Agricultural & Coop: and 
another” (PLD 1996 Supreme Court 108) it was held as under: - 
“….the Court while examining the validity of an award does 
not act as a court of appeal. Therefore, a Court hearing the 
objections to the award cannot undertake reappraisal of 
evidence recorded by the arbitrator in order to discover the 
error or infirmity in the award. The error or infirmity in the 
award which rendered the award invalid must appear on the 
face of the award and should be discoverable by reading the 
award itself. Where reasons recorded by the arbitrator are 
challenged as perverse, the perversity in the reasoning has to 
be established with reference to the material considered by 
the arbitrator in the award.” 
 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
6
  
Said findings were also endorsed by Hon‟ble Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in a case titled “FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through 
Secretary Ministry of Food, Islamabad and others vs. Messrs JOINT 
VENTURE KOCKS K.G/RIST” (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 506). 
  
8. 
 
The basic principles, which should prevail with the 
Court while considering the objections to an award and the criteria 
on the basis of which, an award should be set aside are clearly 
provided in Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act. And on the 
basis of catena of judgments of the superior Courts of our country, it 
is well-settled by now that an arbitration is a forum, which is chosen 
by the parties out of their own free-will and consent, for the 
resolution of the dispute inter se them; such forum has the sanctity of 
the confidence of the parties reposed upon it and to all intents and 
purposes, the Arbitrators are the Judges of law and fact and can 
accordingly decide the dispute. It also cannot be disputed that the 
Arbitrators have the full authority to appreciate the facts of the case, 
according to their own perception, expertise, knowledge and wisdom, 
and such appreciation of facts, if not suffering from the vice of any 
misreading and non-reading of the record, shall not be interfered 
with by the Court only on account that another conclusion is possible. 
There also can be no cavil that the Court while considering the 
validity of the award should not sit as a Court of appeal, trying to 
fish or dig out the latent errors in the proceedings or the award, but 
should only confine to examining the award by ascertaining, if there 
is any error, factual or legal, which floats on the surface of the award 
or the record and if such an amiss is allowed to remain, grave 
injustice shall be done to the aggrieved party. The perversity about 
the reasoning, in view of the dictum of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, 
though is a ground for the interference in the award, but the Court 
should not infer the perversity because of the factual conclusion 
being wrong, rather it should be taken to be analogous and akin to 
“perverse verdict” which means that the factual conclusion drawn is 
against the law; obviously this shall include the decision of the 
Arbitrator on the facts of the case being based upon the misreading 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
7
and the non-reading of the evidence/record. The award of an 
Arbitrator, who is the Judge selected by the parties themselves, 
should not be lightly interfered with un-till and unless it is 
established that the error committed by him is so glaring that if it is 
overlooked, it shall lead to miscarriage of justice. But certainly, the 
award cannot be intercepted on the ground that on the reading of the 
evidence, a conclusion other than arrived at by the Arbitrator, is 
possible. (See PREMIER INSURANCE COMPANY and others vs. 
ATTOCK TEXTILE MILLS LTD.,  PLD 2006 Lahore 534). 
9. 
 
The arbitrator/Umpire is a Judge who is performed the 
functions of a Judge. There are two latin maxims: “Compromissarii 
sunt judices”, meaning that arbitrators are Judges and “arbitrium est 
judiciun,” meaning that an award is a judgment. However, an award 
is not a divine word. It is neither impregnable nor exempt from 
judicial scrutiny. An award can be nullified and set aside in view of 
the statutory provision contained in sub clause (a) of Section 30 ibid 
if an arbitrator has “misconducted himself or the proceedings”. 
“Misconduct” contemplated by Section (a) is thus of two kinds, 
“legal misconduct” and “moral misconduct”. 
 
“Legal misconduct” means that misconduct in the judicial 
sense of the word, for example, some honest, though erroneous, 
breach of duty causing miscarriage of justice; failure to perform the 
essential duties which are cause on an arbitrator; and any irregularity 
of action which is not consistent with general principles of equity 
and good consensus. If an arbitrator‟s act arbitrarily or unreasonable, 
the award will be invalid. 
 
“Moral misconduct” difficult to define executively and exact 
what amounts to misconduct on the part of an arbitrator. The 
expression is of void import, and it means that which is misconduct 
by any standard. In a case of arbitration where the parties interest 
their fate into the hands of an arbitrator, he becomes a Judge in the 
case. Therefore, it is essential that their must be abandoned good 
faith and the arbitrator must be absolutely disinterested and impartial, 
as he is bound to act with scrupulous regard to the ends of justice. 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
8
An arbitrator must be a person who stands indifferent between the 
parties. A Division Bench of this Court in a case titled “Sh. Saleem 
Ali vs. Sh. Akhtar Ali and 7 others” (PLD 2004 Lahore 404) 
elaborated the grounds for setting-aside of the award. This Court in 
another case titled “Khalid Abbas vs. Hafiz Muhammad Farooq” 
(2004 YLR 274) highlighted the elements treating or constituting 
misconduct on the part of the arbitrator as under: - 
“It would be convenient to mention here the elements treating 
or constituting the misconduct on the part of the arbitrators, 
namely: - 
(a) 
neglect of duties and responsibilities by arbitrators; 
(b) 
something contrary to what the Courts of justice expect 
from them before allowing finality to their awards; 
(c) 
if the arbitrator has refused to postpone a meeting for 
purpose of allowing a party to engage a counsel when 
the other party unexpectedly turns up with a counsel; 
(d) 
if the award is made without having heard all the 
evidence; 
(e)  
if the evidence of the witnesses is recorded behind the 
back of a party; 
(f) 
if a party has not been allowed reasonable opportunity 
of proving his case; 
(g) 
if the arbitrator has not brought to the notice of 
opposite-party a document received by him from his 
adversary or not given him an opportunity of meeting 
the inferences deducible from them; 
(h) 
if the irregularities in the proceedings are proved which 
amount to no proper hearing of the matter in dispute; 
(i) 
if the finding is perverse or unsupported by the 
evidence before him; 
(j) 
if the arbitrator decides a disputed question without 
going into evidence as he would in such a case be said 
to have decided blindly; 
(k) 
if there is indication of gross negligence or recklessness 
on the face of the record; 
(l) 
if there is some mistake of fact provided it is either 
admitted or at least clearly beyond reasonable doubt.” 
 
10. 
 
Keeping in view the above principles, now I proceed to 
examine whether the award in question was liable to be set-aside on 
the established facts.  From scanning of the record, it appears that the 
parties (respondents No.1 & 2) agreed to refer their dispute to the 
arbitrators with regard to fixation of the price of suit house through 
written arbitration agreement dated 03.06.1982 (Exh.A-2). In this 
regard, a set of two arbitrators from each side was appointed by each 
party. Respondent No.2 appointed Syed Kazim Hussain and Syed 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
9
Shabbir Hussain as his arbitrators and respondent No.1 appointed 
Malik Muhammad Anwar and Jehangir Sarwar Sheikh as his 
arbitrators. Both sides with mutual understanding gave them 
authority to pass arbitration decision/award with regard to the price 
of the suit house. It was also settled that if the arbitrators failed to 
give any decision/award, then parties will be bound to appoint an 
Umpire and in that eventuality decision/award rendered by Umpire 
will be acceptable to both parties and the same will not be 
challengeable before any Court of law. Said agreement was 
witnessed by Sufi Nisar Ahmed and Muhammad Umer Baig. Said 
agreement was not disputed by respondent No.2 (Syed Jaffar Hussain) 
rather admitted it as correct. For better understanding said agreement 
is reproduced in verbatim as under:-

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
10
11.            It is a matter of record that the arbitrators failed to give 
arbitration decision, therefore, respondent No.1 filed an application 
under Sections 11 & 20 of the Act, 1940 on 11.11.1982 (Exh.A-8) 
with the contention that he and respondent No.2 appointed arbitrators 
but said arbitrators failed to give their arbitration decision, therefore, 
arbitrators appointed by respondent No.2 be removed and fresh 
arbitrators be appointed and notice be issued to the respondents of 
the application to file arbitration decision in the Court.  Respondent 
No.2 filed its contesting written reply on 23.01.1983 (Exh.A-9) by 
raising certain preliminary objections to the effect that applicant did 
not come to the Court with clean hands; that the applicant has no 
cause of action; that the arbitrators failed to give their arbitration 
decision within a period of four months from the date of their 
appointment i.e. 03.06.1982, therefore, the arbitration agreement 
became void and while replying on facts maintained that his 
arbitrators always ready to perform their duty but the applicant‟s 
arbitrators are not ready to hold the meeting. The arbitrators of 
respondent No.2 filed their written reply on 26.01.1983 (Exh.A-10) 
and respondent No.1‟s arbitrators filed their reply on 02.02.1983 
(Exh.A-11). The learned trial Court, who ceased of the matter, vide 
order dated 06.03.1983 directed as under: - 
“All the arbitrators except Syed Shabbir Hussain are present 
today. They have requested the court that they may be 
provided some time so that they may complete the arbitration 
proceedings and submit the award in the court and 
accordingly they are granted time up-till 30.03.1983 by which 
they should complete the proceedings and submit the award 
on duly stamped paper before the court on or before 
30.03.1983. The meeting of all the arbitrators and the parties 
shall be called by Sh. Jahangir Sarwar Advocate and the 
proceedings will be completed in his hand-writing. To come 
up for the presentation of the award on 30.03.1983.” 
 
 
On 30.03.1983 award was not submitted and prayed for an 
adjournment. The case was adjourned to 16.04.1983. On the said 
date case was adjourned to 24.04.1983. The arbitrator Sh. Jahangir 
Sarwar Advocate submitted his interim report dated 15.04.1983 
(Exh.A-15). The said arbitrator in his report maintained that the 
arbitrators of Jaffar Hussain (respondent No.2) assessed the market 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
11
value of suit house in the year 1974 as 40/50 thousand rupees and 
assed the present value as Rs.300,000/-, whereas, the arbitrators of 
Saif-ur-Rehman (respondent No.1) assessed the market price of the 
suit house in the year 1974 as Rs.40,000/-, whereas, in the year 1983 
as Rs.150,000/-. He further narrated in his report that a dispute arose 
whether market value of the suit house was to be assessed according 
to the market price prevailing in the year 1974 or in present and they 
(arbitrators) are unable to agree upon it, therefore, an Umpire be 
appointed to decide the controversy. The order sheet available on the 
record as Exh.A-14 further reveals that on 23.05.1983 respondent 
No.1 moved an application for appointment of the Umpire. The case 
was adjourned to 20.06.1983 and on said date respondent No.2 filed 
the written reply and learned counsel for the parties (respondents 
No.1 & 2) got recorded their statement to the effect that if the 
arbitrators failed to reach a consensus then they have no objection if 
Malik Mahr Ali, Naib Tehsildar be appointed as an Umpire. In the 
light of said statement of learned counsel for the parties, the learned 
trial Court vide order of the same date appointed Malik Mahr Ali, 
Naib Tehsildar as an Umpire with a direction to give his arbitration 
decision after providing opportunity to the parties and adjourned the 
proceedings to 26.07.1983. On said date, interim report was 
submitted, and proceeding was adjourned to 10.09.1983. On said 
date, a sealed envelope containing the award dated 07.09.1983 of 
Naib Tehsildar Sargodha was received and opened in presence of the 
parties and their learned counsel and directed the parties to file their 
objections. Copy of order sheet (Exh.A-14) further reveals that on 
08.01.1984 the learned trial Court took a notice that the award is on a 
judicial paper rather the same be written on a stamp paper and 
directed the Umpire to submit the award after writing it on a stamp 
paper and adjourned the matter to 28.02.1984. On 28.02.1984 award 
dated 26.02.1984 (Exh.A-1) was produced before the Court. Copies 
of the evidence oral as well as documentary produced by the parties 
before the Umpire were also attached with the award (Exh.A-23). 
Perusal of the award dated 26.02.1984 (Exh.A-1) it appears that the 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015

Umpire not only recorded the evidence of the parties oral as well as 
documentary but also visited the suit house. In the light of evidence 
he reached to a conclusion that the market price of the suit house was 
to be settled, as was prevalent in the year 1974 when the earnest 
money was paid and maintained that in the year 1974 when the 
earnest money of Rs.5000/- was paid to respondent No.2, at that time 
market value of the suit house was Rs.50,000/- and declared that as 
the vendor (respondent No.2) received an amount of Rs.5000/- from 
the vendee (respondent No.1), therefore, respondent No.1 after 
payment of remaining consideration amount of Rs.45,000/- is 
entitled to get registered the sale deed of the suit house in his favour. 
However, the learned trial Court enhanced the consideration amount 
from Rs.50,000/- to Rs.10,00,000/- and made the award dated 
07.09.1983/26.02.1984 as rule of the Court subject to deposit of 
Rs.10,00,000/- within a period of two months by respondent No.1 for 
onward payment to the subsequent purchasers  failing which the 
award shall be deemed to have been turned down. 
12. 
 
It is also matter of record that respondent No.1 in order 
to prove the award produced the Umpire namely Malik Mahr Ali the 
then Naib Tehsildar as AW-1 who in his statement maintained that 
he remained Naib Tehsildar from March 1983 to September, 1983 in 
Sargodha and in the light of Court‟s order he gave notices to the 
parties, heard them, inspected the spot and recorded the evidence 
produced by the parties. He further deposed that initially he 
submitted award on a plain paper but later on upon the direction of 
the Court he submitted award dated 26.02.1984 on a stamp paper 
(Exh.A-1) which is in his hand-writing and bears his signature. 
During cross examination he maintained that he informed the parties 
with regard to the arbitration decision. He also maintained that he 
assessed the price of the house bonafidely in the light of the 
documents produced before him. He also deposed that no one 
boycott the arbitration proceedings and they posed their confidence 
upon him. He denied the suggestion that he was forced by Malik 
Muhammad Aslam Khechala Member National Assembly to give 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
13
decision in favour of respondent No.1.  He also maintained that he 
kept in view the agreement for appointment of arbitrators. He 
remained affirm during lengthy cross examination. Respondent No.1 
produced Muhammad Sarwar deed writer as AW-4 who maintained 
that he scribed the arbitration agreement dated 03.06.1982 (Exh.A-2). 
One of the attesting witnesses of the said arbitration agreement 
namely Nisar Ahmad son of Muratab Ali got recorded his statement 
as AW-5. Jahangir Sarwar Sheikh one of the arbitrators appeared as 
AW-6 and respondent No.1 got recorded his statement as AW-7. On 
behalf of the petitioners Azmat Khan Wasiqa Navees appeared as 
RW-1. Nisar Wasiqa Navees appeared as RW-2, Syed Kazim 
Hussain, one of the arbitrators from respondent No.2‟s side was 
appeared as RW-3 and Fida Hussain general attorney of respondent 
No.2 as RW-4. RW-4 produced copy of power of attorney as Exh.R-
5 and copy of sale deed as Exh.R-6. The petitioners also produced 
copy of register Wasiqa as Exh.R-1, copy of register Wasiqa as 
Exh.R-2, copy of P.T-1 Form as Exh.R-3, certified copy of the 
consolidated judgment and decree dated 18.12.2009 passed in a suit 
for permanent injunction and declaration as Exh.R-4. 
13. 
 
The Umpire concluded in his award that in the year 
1974 when earnest money of the suit house was paid the market 
value of the suit house at that time was Rs.50,000/-. In the report 
dated 15.04.1983 (Exh.A-15) submitted by Jahangir Sarwar Sheikh 
Advocate maintained that arbitrators appointed by respondent No.2, 
assessed the market value of the suit house in the year 1974 as 
Rs.40,000/50,000/-, whereas, respondent No.1‟s arbitrators assessed 
the market value of the suit house in the year 1974 as Rs.40,000/-. In 
this way the Umpire followed the market value of the suit house as 
assessed by respondent No.2‟s arbitrators. 
14.         The learned trial Court keeping in view that award was 
delivered in the year 1983 i.e. 27 years back and since then the value 
of the currency has decreased manifold, therefore, directed 
respondent No.1 to deposit Rs.10,00,000/- in the Court within a 
period of two months for onward payment to the subsequent 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
14
purchasers (petitioners No.2 & 3) who stepped into the shoes of deceased 
Syed Jaffar Hussain (respondent No.2) and in this way safeguarded the 
interest of the petitioners and respondent No.2. 
15. 
 
Neither the petitioners nor Syed Jaffar Hussain 
(respondent No.2) appeared before the learned trial Court in support 
of their objections. Although general attorney of respondent No.2 
appeared as RW-4 but he did not utter a single word with regard to 
misconduct of the Umpire. Respondent No.2 with his free will gave 
his consent with regard to appointment of Malik Mahr Ali, Naib 
Tehsildar as an Umpire and remained appearing before the Umpire 
and also produced oral as well as documentary evidence and during 
said proceedings he did not raise any objection with regard to 
partiality and misconduct of the Umpire. 
  
16. 
 
From scanning of the evidence oral as well as 
documentary and keeping in view the principles highlighted by this 
Court as well as Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan it appears that 
respondent No.2 as well as the petitioners failed to established on 
record that either Umpire misconducted himself or misconducted in 
the proceedings while giving the award. 
17. 
 
Question of limitation was also raised by maintaining 
that award was barred by time. In this regard the learned trial Court 
framed issue No.3 and decided the same against respondent No.2 & 
petitioners. Said findings were upheld by the learned appellate Court. 
 
The first schedule of the Act, 1940 Rule 3 provides four 
months‟ time for giving the award in the following terms: - 
“3. The arbitrators shall make their award within four months 
after entering on the reference or after having been called 
upon to act by notice in writing from any party to the 
arbitration agreement or within such extended time as the 
Court may allow.” 
 
 
Although through arbitration agreement dated 03.06.1982, the 
parties appointed their arbitrators for settlement of the price of the 
suit house but said arbitrators failed to give their arbitration decision, 
therefore, with consent of the parties the learned trial Court, who 
ceased of the matter, vide order dated 20.06.1983 appointed Malik 
Mahr Ali, Naib Tehsildar as an Umpire who gave the award on 

C.R. No. 1525 of 2015 
15
07.09.1983 and submitted to the Court through sealed envelope 
which was opened in presence of the parties and their counsel on 
10.09.1983. Later on the learned trial Court observed that said 
agreement was written on judicial paper rather on a stamp paper and 
directed the Umpire to submit the award by writing down on stamp 
paper and adjourned the proceedings to 28.02.1984 and on the said 
date the Umpire submitted the award dated 26.02.1984 written on 
stamp paper. Respondent No.2 remained participating in the 
proceedings. The Umpire submitted the award within prescribed 
period of limitation and the findings of the Courts below with regard 
to issue No.3 are maintained and upheld. 
18.            Learned counsel for the petitioners has failed to point out 
any illegality, irregularity, mis-reading, non-reading or jurisdictional 
defect in the impugned judgments of learned Courts below 
warranting interference by this Court while exercising its revisional 
jurisdiction under Section 115 C.P.C. Even otherwise, they failed to 
establish on record with regard to misconduct of the Umpire and 
failed to establish the grounds as enumerated above for setting-aside 
of the award.  
19. 
       In view of the above, I find no substance in the arguments 
advanced by learned counsel for the petitioners. Consequently, this 
civil revision is dismissed  being meritless with no order as to costs.
