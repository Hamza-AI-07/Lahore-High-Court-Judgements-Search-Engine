Mr.Atif Mushtaq Bhutta, Advocate for the petitioner. 
 
Through this Civil Revision, the petitioner has 
challenged the orders and decree dated 22.07.2024 and 
23.07.2024 as well as judgment and decree dated 
21.05.2025 passed by learned Courts below. 
2. 
The brief facts of the case are that petitioner filed 
suit for declaration along with permanent injunction 
accompanied by an application under order XXXIX rules 
1 and 2 CPC for grant of temporary injunction against 
respondents before the learned Trial Court. The suit as 
well as application for temporary injunction was 
contested by respondent No.7 by filing contesting written 
statement and raising preliminary objection regarding 
maintainability of suit and the learned Trial Court after 
hearing learned counsel for the parties dismissed the stay 
application through order dated 22.07.2024 and thereafter 
rejected the plaint of the suit vide order dated 
23.07.2024, which were assailed by the petitioner by 
preferring Civil Appeal which met the same fate through 
judgment dated 21.05.2025. Hence this Civil Revision. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that 
impugned orders and decree as well as judgment and 
decree passed by learned Courts below are against law 

2 
C.R.No.811 of 2025 
 
and facts of the case. Adds further that the material 
available on suit file was not duly appreciated by the 
leaned Courts below while rendering their decisions and 
dealt the matter in haste as well as slipshod manner and 
that bar of jurisdiction has wrongly been exercised by the 
learned Courts below while rejecting the plaint of the suit 
filed by the petitioner and they have failed to apply the 
law settled by the apex Court in such like cases, 
therefore, their verdicts are liable to be set aside. 
4. 
Arguments heard and record perused. 
5. 
The core issue requiring determination by this 
Court is whether the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is 
barred in matters arising out of the West Pakistan 
Consolidation of Holdings Ordinance, 1960. 
 
6. 
It is well-settled that Civil Court possesses plenary 
jurisdiction, enabling it to determine whether an authority 
or Tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction or acted ultra 
vires. It can also intervene in cases involving allegations 
of fraud and misrepresentation. However, the question 
arises whether Civil Court can assume jurisdiction in 
specialized subjects where specific forums have been 
established and the Civil Courts lack expertise. 
Moreover, when its jurisdiction is expressly ousted by 
Special Law.  
 
7. 
In the instant matter both the Courts below non-
suited the petitioner while holding that the suit filed by 
the petitioner is not maintainable in view of the bar 
contained in section 26 of the West Pakistan 
Consolidation of Holdings Ordinance, 1960. It is 
advantageous to reproduce Section 26 of the Ordinance:- 
"No Civil Court shall entertain any suit or 
application to obtain a decision or order in respect 

3 
C.R.No.811 of 2025 
 
of any matter which Government or the Board of 
Revenue or any officer is, by this Ordinance, 
empowered to determine, decide or dispose of." 
 
The plain language of Section 26 unequivocally bars 
Civil Courts' jurisdiction. The Supreme Court of Pakistan 
has authoritatively construed this provision, affirming its 
clear intent to oust jurisdiction of Civil Court. In the 
judgment reported as Muhammad Yaseen vs. Province of 
the Punjab and others (2009 SCMR 753), wherein it was 
held as under:- 
“4 The petitioner has challenged different orders 
passed by the Consolidation Officers including, 
Board of Revenue. The adjustment of lands and 
share distribution in consolidation operations fell 
within 
the 
exclusive 
jurisdiction 
of 
the 
Consolidation Authority and Civil Court could not 
sit in appeal on them. By the very nature of the task, 
the judgments of the consolidation officers were to 
be respected subject to remedies for their correction 
in the mode and manner provided in the 
consolidation law of Holdings” 
 
In another judgment reported as Nawab vs. Ghulab and 4 
others (2004 SCMR 1833) it was held as under:- 
“5. We having considered the matter in detail, find 
that no exception can be taken to the judgment of 
the High Court wherein it has been held that due to 
the bar of jurisdiction contained in section 26 of 
Consolidation of Holdings Ordinance, 1960, the 
civil suit was not maintainable. The judgment of the 
High Court being not suffering from any illegality, 
would not call for interference of this Court This 
petition having no substance is accordingly, 
dismissed. Leave is refused.” 
 
Further reliance in this respect is placed upon the 
judgments reported as  Atta Muhammad and another vs. 
Additional District Judge, Taunsa Sharif and others 
(2014 YLR 2185),  Ali Sher and 11 others vs. Abdul Haq 
and 39 others (2012 MLD 1106), Sanjha and another vs. 
Elahi Bakhsh and 3 others (2006 YLR 1931), Sardra 
and 4 others vs. Province of the Punjab through 
Collector, District Jhang and 17 others (2000 CLC 
1752), Mst. Roshan Bibi vs. Member, Board of Revenue 

4 
C.R.No.811 of 2025 
 
(Consolidation), Lahore and 2 others (1994 MLD 1513) 
and Karam Elahi through legal heirs vs. Feroz Mining 
Ltd.,Abbotabad and another (PLD 1990 Peshawar 174).  
 
8. 
The petitioner relies on precedents1 to argue that 
civil courts retain jurisdiction when an authority's or 
tribunal's order is tainted by malice or fraud. There is no 
cavil to the proposition that the civil court possesses 
broad authority to review actions of any tribunal or 
authority that exceed jurisdiction or are ultra vires. 
However, where a special law provides a specific forum 
and expressly excludes the civil court’s jurisdiction, the 
court’s role becomes limited. Mere allegations of fraud or 
misrepresentation do not, by themselves, confer 
jurisdiction upon the civil court. To attract its 
jurisdiction, the alleged fraud must go to the root of the 
matter — affecting the very decision-making authority — 
and not be of a merely procedural or incidental nature. 
Bare or unsupported claims of fraud are insufficient to 
invoke civil court jurisdiction. 
 
9. 
The perusal of the impugned judgments and decree 
reveals that the petitioner has challenged the order dated 
29-12-1992 passed by respondent No. 3, alleging that 
respondent No. 7 procured the same by fraud, concealing 
the proceedings from the petitioner and thereby obtaining 
an ex-parte order. However, the record indicates 
otherwise; the petitioner himself has attached the civil 
miscellaneous application No.2156-2025 with the instant 
petition, containing the orders passed by official 
respondents Nos. 1 to 6; moreover, the order dated 
29.12.1992 expressly records the petitioner’s presence at 
                                          
1 Islamic Republic of Pakistan vs. S.A.Rizvi (1992 SCMR 1309) and Muhammad Zafar and 23 
others vs. Yousaf Ali and 9 others (2003 CLC 1922). 

5 
C.R.No.811 of 2025 
 
the time of its pronouncement. Accordingly, the 
challenge to the said order now taken by the petitioner 
appears to be an afterthought aimed at depriving 
respondent No. 7 of the fruits of that order. 
10. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to 
point out any irregularity or illegality in the decisions 
rendered by the learned Courts below nor this Court 
found any misinterpretation of law or non-appreciation of 
material available on file to call for interference in its 
revisional jurisdiction and the learned fora below have 
correctly non-suited the petitioner while relying on 
provisions of section West Pakistan Consolidation of 
Holdings Ordinance, 1960. 
11. 
Resultantly, this Civil Revision having no merit 
and force is dismissed in limine.
