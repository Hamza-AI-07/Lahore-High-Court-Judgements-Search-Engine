for the respondents – Islamia University of Bahawalpur

This and connected constitutional petition bearing 
W.P. No.4161/2024 (‘companion case’) raise and seek 
determination of common question of law, hence, decided 
through instant order.  
2. 
Pertinent chronological perspective is that Fact-
Finding committee was constituted, by the Vice 
Chancellor, 
through 
Notification 
No.152/AF 
dated 
13.09.2022 to probe into matter of discrepancies in the 
registration returns record of LLB 03-year program. 
 
ISSUE-AT-HAND 
  
Question, fundamentally, calling for determination 
is ‘Whether the Vice Chancellor of the Islamia University 
of Bahawalpur (‘the University’) possess the authority / 
power to constitute a Fact-Finding Committee, in the 

W.P. No.4160/2024 
 
-:2:- 
 
 
context of circumstances of instant case, or Whether such 
authority / power exclusively vests with the Authority(ies) 
indicated in section 29 of the Islamia University of 
Bahawalpur Act, 1975 (Act, 1975).           
3. 
For the purposes of defining the scope of 
adjudication, it is pertinent to point out that these 
constitutional petitions traced their origin from the order 
dated 13.12.2023, whereby learned Division Bench of this 
Court, 
while 
allowing 
the 
appeal, 
bearing 
ICA 
No.137/2023, preferred against the decision of learned 
Single Judge of 05.06.2023, remitted for determination the 
question of jurisdiction of the Vice Chancellor, to the 
Syndicate of the University. Paragraph 9 of the order, 
containing relevant direction, is hereunder reproduced for 
adequate comprehension, 
“In view of the above, instant as well as connected appeal 
and writ petition are allowed in the manner that we are 
inclined to transmit copies of writ petitions, along with 
annexures to respondent-Syndicate with direction to treat 
the same as objections on behalf of appellants / petitioners 
against constitution of the Fact Finding Committee and 
decide the same in accordance with law while keeping in 
view the relevant provisions of the Act of 1975, without 
being influenced by the impugned findings, after hearing 
the appellants / petitioners and all concerned, preferably 
within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of 
certified copy of this order. In order to facilitate the process, 
appellants / petitioners shall appear before respondent- 
Syndicate on 21.12.2023 at 10:30 a.m. Learned Law Officer 
shall ensure compliance of this order. Compliance report 
shall be furnished to this Court through Deputy Registrar 
(Judicial). 
The 
impugned 
judgment 
stands 
modified 
accordingly.”

Subsequent to passing of aforesaid order, matter was 
placed before the Syndicate of the University, in its 85th 
meeting, held on 27.02.2024, as Agenda Item No.12 and 
was decided accordingly - extract of the minutes of the 
meeting regarding Item No.12 was intimated through order 
dated 01.04.2024. Evidently, the Syndicate acknowledged, 
affirmed and validated the exercise of jurisdiction by the 
Vice Chancellor, that is an act of constituting Fact-Finding 
Committee – scope of recommendations by the Fact-
finding committee are not subject matter of present 
challenge. 
5. 
Determination of the question of jurisdiction of the 
Vice Chancellor, by the Syndicate in 85th meeting, is 
subject matter of present challenge. 
6. 
Report and para-wise comments were solicited and 
submitted by the University. 
7. 
Learned counsel for first and second petitioners 
contends that the Syndicate had failed to appreciate, 
construe and follow the mandate of the directions / 
observations recorded in paragraph 9 (supra). Submits that 
Syndicate, single mindedly, considered the scope, effect 
and applicability of section 15(1) of Act, 1975, while 
conspicuously ignoring the relevance, scope and effect of 
the powers otherwise extended unto various Authorities, 

W.P. No.4160/2024 
 
-:4:- 
 
 
for purposes of composition of various committee(s), by 
virtue of section 29 of the Act 1975, which details of 
Authorities conspicuously exclude the Vice Chancellor – 
Vice Chancellor is not classified as Authority under 
section 21 of the Act, 1975. Learned counsel explains that 
section 15(1) of Act, 1975 has no application in the context 
of the controversy, which provision of law cannot be relied 
upon to confer or extend purported power to the Vice 
Chancellor to constitute the Fact-Finding committee, 
which is the domain of the Authorities identified in section 
29, ibid.– [Syndicate for the purposes of present 
controversy]. 
8. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the University and 
others submits that exercise of power by the Vice 
Chancellor, to constitute the Fact-Finding committee, 
strictly comes within the scope of section 15(1) of the Act 
1975, which empowers the Vice Chancellor, as principal 
executive officer of the University and responsible for 
administrative control over the affairs and officers of the 
University, to act accordingly. Adds that section 29 of the 
Act, 1975, for the purposes of present controversy, is not 
attracted. Further submits that powers extended to the Vice 
Chancellor cannot be undermined by superimposing the 
effect of section 29 of the Act, 1975, which provision has 

W.P. No.4160/2024 
 
-:5:- 
 
 
its peculiar contextual relevance within the context of the 
powers and duties, statutorily assigned to each of the 
Authority defined therein.  Learned counsel also objects to 
assumption of jurisdiction in the context of observations 
recorded in the case of Pakistan Bar Council through Chairman 
and others vs. Federal Government through Establishment Division and 
others (2019 SCMR 389). 
9. 
Heard. Learned counsel concur that scope and 
jurisprudential potentiality of section 29 of the Act, 1975 is 
an unchartered territory and uncertainty encompassing it 
requires adjudication. 
10. 
Despite plea of overshadowing uncertainty there 
appears a silver lining, which is an acknowledgment and 
recognition extended through order of 13.12.2023, 
whereby learned Division Bench affirmed the authority of 
the Syndicate to determine the scope and effect of 
jurisdiction exercised by the Vice Chancellor, while 
constituting the Fact-Finding committee. It is apparent 
from the reasoning of the order of 13.12.2023 that exercise 
of authority by the Vice Chancellor was analyzed and 
gauged in the context of power of delegation, extended to 
the Syndicate under section 25(cc) of Act, 1975. It is 
pertinent to mention that section 25(cc) of the Act, 1975 
may not be relevant for the purposes of present 

W.P. No.4160/2024 
 
-:6:- 
 
 
controversy, since it never was the case of the University 
that power so exercised by the Vice Chancellor was a 
delegated authority of the Syndicate or borrowed one, but 
independently vesting in the Vice Chancellor under section 
15 of the Act, 1975. 
In these circumstances, relevance and exclusivity of 
section 15(1) of the Act, 1975 cannot be undermined, 
which in fact requires sharper focus while deciding the 
controversy. It is expedient to reproduce texts of sections 
15 and 29 of the Act, 1975 for reference, which read as, 
15. Powers and duties of the Vice-Chancellor.– (1) The 
Vice-Chancellor shall be the principal executive and 
academic officer of the University and shall ensure that the 
provisions of this Act, the Statutes, the Regulations and 
the Rules are faithfully observed in order to promote 
teaching, research, publication, administration and the 
general efficiency and good order of the University. He 
shall have all powers necessary for this purpose including 
administrative control over all officers, teachers and 
other employees of the University.  
  
(2) The Vice-Chancellor shall preside at the meetings 
of the Authorities of which he is the Chairman and be 
entitled to attend and preside at any meeting of any other 
Authority or body of the University. 
  
(3) Subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, 
the Vice Chancellor may, in an emergency, take an action 
which is not otherwise in the competence of the Vice 
Chancellor but is in the competence of any other Authority. 
  
(3a) The Vice Chancellor shall, within seven days of 
taking an action under sub-section (3), submit a report of the 
action taken to the Pro-Chancellor and to the members of the 
Syndicate; and, the Syndicate shall, within forty five days of 
such an action of the Vice-Chancellor, pass such orders as 
the Syndicate deems appropriate. 
 (4) The Vice-Chancellor shall also have the powers– 

W.P. No.4160/2024 
 
-:7:- 
 
 
(i) to sanction all expenditure provided for in the 
approved budget, and to re-appropriate funds within 
the same major head of expenditure;  
(ii) to sanction by re-appropriation an amount not 
exceeding Rs. 5,000 for an unforeseen item not 
provided for in the budget and report it to the 
Syndicate at the next meeting;  
(iii) to appoint paper setters and examiners for all 
examinations of the University after receiving panels 
of names from the relevant Authorities;  
(iv) to make such arrangements for the scrutiny of 
papers, marks and results as he may consider 
necessary;  
(v) to direct teachers, officers and other employees 
of the University to take up such assignments in 
connection with teaching, research, examinations, 
administration and such other activities in the 
University as he may consider necessary for the 
purpose of the University;  
(vi) to delegate, subject to such conditions, if any as 
may be prescribed, any of his powers under this Act 
to an officer or officers of the University; 
(vii) to appoint employees below the initial monthly 
pay of Rs.500; and  
(viii) to exercise and perform such other powers and 
functions as may be prescribed. 
 
29. Appointment of committees by certain Authorities.– 
The Senate, the Syndicate, the Academic Council and other 
Authorities may, from time to time, appoint such standing, 
special or advisory committees as they may deem fit and 
may nominate such persons on these committees as are not 
members of the Authorities appointing the committees. 
[Emphasis supplied] 
11. 
No objection regarding co-existence of sections 15 
and 29 of the Act, 1975 is raised, nor superiority of one 
provision over the other is pleaded. Conspicuously, powers 
and duties of the Vice Chancellor are defined under section 
15 of the Act, 1975. Likewise, the composition, powers 
and duties of the Syndicate are specified in section 25 of 

W.P. No.4160/2024 
 
-:8:- 
 
 
the Act, 1975. Pertinent to mention that powers and duties 
of each of the Authority, identified in section 29 of the 
Act, 1975, are otherwise separately listed in the Act, 1975. 
Syndicate is the executive body of the University, 
subjected to the provisions of the Act of 1975, which 
exercises general supervision over the affairs of the 
University. No power or corresponding duty is shown to 
vest in the Syndicate in the context of raison ďetre of the 
Fact-Finding committee. Whether Syndicate, if it deems 
fit, could proceed to direct formation / appointment of any 
standing, special or advisory committee(s) with respect to 
any power or corresponding duty, statutorily assigned to 
any other Authority – for instance if any specific power or 
duty is assigned to the Academic Council; whether 
committee could be constituted by Syndicate in the context 
of the power of the Academic Council or for that matter 
the Senate. Likewise, powers and duties assigned to each 
Authority and the Officers of the University – [defined 
under section 10 of the Act, 1975] are Authority or officer 
specific, in the context of Act of 1975. Hence, intrusion by 
one Authority in the domain of powers conferred and 
duties assigned to other Authority or in the powers and 
duties prescribed for the Officers of the University, or by 
way of passing of any order by the Authority, in excess of 

W.P. No.4160/2024 
 
-:9:- 
 
 
the powers and duties defined in the Act, 1975, is 
impermissible, unjustified, devoid of authority and in fact 
a non-starter. Therefore, the assignment / power extended 
upon each of the Authority, in terms of section 29 of the 
Act, 1975, to constitute committee(s) – [standing, special 
or advisory] – has to be read and construed in the company 
of the powers extended and duties assigned to each of the 
Authority and the Officers of the University. And building 
on this line of reasoning, there appears no cavil that 
exclusivity to constitute committees by each of the 
Authority is confined to the extent of the powers and 
duties prescribed. And any incidence of intrusion / 
encroachment, by constituting committee(s) with reference 
to any matter, otherwise falling outside the domain or 
authority of any particular Authority constitutes statutory 
wrong, having consequence of disturbing the structural 
balance and administrative framework knitted through the 
Act, 1975. By same analogy, the Syndicate lacks authority, 
in terms of section 29 of the Act, 1975, to constitute 
committee(s) with reference to the matter, otherwise 
coming within the jurisdictional domain of the Vice 
Chancellor – scenario would be different if the Syndicate, 
while hearing any objection or representation against some 
action or decision of the Vice Chancellor, provided such 

W.P. No.4160/2024 
 
-:10:- 
 
 
course is provided in law, considers appropriate to 
constitute any committee, be it under section 29 of the Act, 
1975 or otherwise provided by virtue of Statutes, 
Regulations or Rules. In this case learned Division Bench 
remitted matter to the Syndicate for determining the 
question of jurisdiction of Vice Chancellor. Syndicate has 
neither claimed nor indicated any intent to exercise power 
under section 29 of the Act, 1975. Additionally, no 
exclusivity is otherwise claimable by any of the Authority 
under section 29 of the Act, 1975, but to the extent of the 
powers extended and duties assigned under the Act, 1975, 
Statutes, Regulations or Rules, as the case may be. 
12. 
Argument by the counsel for the petitioner is 
otherwise flawed on its face. Textual reading of section 29 
of the Act, 1975, at the first blush, extends an impression 
that powers extended thereunder, exercisable by each of 
the Authority(ies) are discretionary and exercisable ‘as 
they may deem fit’. Now the context is that learned 
Division Bench of this Court, vide order of 13.12.2023, 
remitted matter to the Syndicate for determining validity of 
the decision of Vice Chancellor, and the Syndicate – 
decision-making authority - had acknowledged and 
recognized the authority / jurisdiction of the Vice 
Chancellor under section 15(1) of the Act, 1975 vis-à-vis 

W.P. No.4160/2024 
 
-:11:- 
 
 
an act of constituting the Fact-Finding committee. It is 
absurd to attribute ignorance to the Syndicate qua its 
powers and duties, including the authority extended under 
section 29 of the Act, 1975. Acquiescence on the part of 
the Syndicate adequately answers and explains a lot.  
Whether such determination does not demand deference to 
the decision by the decision-making authority and showing 
restraint in exercise of judicial review jurisdiction. In fact, 
the jurisdiction of the Syndicate, to constitute a committee, 
is advocated tenaciously, however said Authority, when 
asked to adjudge the legality of act of the Vice Chancellor, 
had subscribed to it. This endorsement per se gravitates 
lawfulness qua the exercise of powers by Vice Chancellor 
by constituting the Fact-Finding committee, in the factual 
context of the case. 
13. 
While exercising judicial review jurisdiction, 
substantially 
the 
elements 
of 
correctness 
and 
reasonableness need to be analyzed. Determination by the 
Syndicate meets the standard of correctness and standard 
of reasonableness, qua the order – absence of fairness or 
lack of provisioning of adequate opportunity are not 
pleaded as ground. And last but not the least, an act of 
formation of the Fact-Finding Committee, in wake of 
discrepancies in the registration returns record of LLB 03-

W.P. No.4160/2024 
 
-:12:- 
 
 
year program, is substantially a matter coming within the 
domain of administrative functions of the Vice Chancellor, 
who is assigned with the duty of ensuring compliance with 
laws / statutes / regulations. In wake of the affirmation by 
the Syndicate, that exercise of power / authority by Vice 
Chancellor is lawful and permissible, no case for 
assumption and exercise of jurisdiction is made out, which 
assumption, in view of the narrative, tantamount to 
interference in the internal affairs of the University and in 
fact constitute an act of usurpation of power of another 
decision-making authority, when no occasion arises for 
reviewing the decision of the decision-making authority. 
This kind of interference, in the circumstances of present 
case, in the guise of judicial review jurisdiction, is 
deprecated in terms of the ratio of decision in the case of 
Vice-Chancellor Agriculture University Peshawar and 
others V. Muhammad Shafiq (2024 SCMR 527). It is 
therefore, declared that section 29 of Act, 1975 has no 
application to this case. Decision of the Syndicate is 
upheld on merits.  
  
Objection qua absence of jurisdiction to hear this 
petition on merits is misconceived, wherein, primarily, 
questions raised is whether direction(s) by learned 
Division Bench, while allowing ICA No.137/2023, were 

W.P. No.4160/2024 
 
-:13:- 
 
 
duly complied and whether any provision of Act, 1975 was 
misconstrued and misinterpreted to the prejudice of the 
petitioners. 
Scope 
of 
fact-finding 
committee 
and 
recommendations are not subject matter of adjudication, 
hence, observations recorded in the case of Pakistan Bar 
Council through Chairman and others V. Federal 
Government through Establishment Division and others 
(2019 SCMR 389) are not attracted. In view of above, 
order impugned manifests no illegality or any defect 
apparent thereupon requiring interference. 
14. 
This and accompanied petitions are dismissed in 
wake of the narrative above.
