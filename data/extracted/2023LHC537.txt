MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.:- This 
writ petition is directed against the rejection letter dated 23.08.2022, 
issued by the Presiding Member, Punjab Public Service Commission 
(“PPSC”), Lahore as well as orders dated 08.11.2022 & 15.12.2022, 
passed by respondent No.6 / Member, PPSC, Lahore and respondent 
No.7 / Director Recruitment-I, PPSC, Lahore, respectively, whereby 
petitioner’s candidature for the post of Lecturer Philosophy (Female) 
(BS-17) in the Punjab Higher Education Department, was rejected on 
account of non-issuance / non-submission of her domicile certificate 
and petitioner’s representations in this regard were rejected.  
2. 
Necessary facts are that in response to advertisement for the post 
of Lecturer Philosophy (Female) (BS-17) in the Punjab Higher 
Education Department, petitioner having requisite qualification, 
applied for the post in question on the basis of domicile certificate of 
her husband, namely Asim Raza son of Hakim Ali, who was resident 
of District Gujrat having domicile certificate of same district (as 
petitioner had not yet applied for issuance of domicile till the closing 
date for filing of applications i.e. 17.12.2021). Thereafter, petitioner 
successfully passed the written test and was called for interview for 
recruitment to the post in question. She appeared along with necessary 
documents including her husband’s domicile certificate in addition to 

 
2 
Writ Petition No.2412 of 2023 
 
her own, as she got issued her domicile certificate on 16.03.2022. 
However, respondent-PPSC, vide letter dated 23.08.2022, refused to 
interview the petitioner and rejected her candidature for the post in 
question on account of non-issuance / non-submission of her domicile 
certificate before the closing date. Petitioner filed representations 
which were rejected vide orders dated 13.09.2022 and 22.09.2022. 
Feeling aggrieved, petitioner approached this Court by way of filing 
W.P. No.57809 of 2022, which was allowed vide judgment dated 
03.10.2022 with the direction to re-decide the representation strictly in 
accordance with law and keeping in view Regulation No.23(e) of the 
Punjab Public Service Commission Regulations, 2016 (“the PPSC 
Regulations, 2016”). However, petitioner’s representations were again 
rejected vide orders dated 08.11.2022 & 15.12.2022. Hence, instant 
petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for petitioner submits that respondents were 
required to pass a speaking order, keeping in view the provisions of 
Regulation 23(e) of the PPSC Regulations, 2016, whereby only 
domicile of petitioner’s husband was to be considered, but this aspect 
of the matter has been overlooked while passing impugned orders 
merely by following the Policy Decision, which practice has been 
deprecated by the Hon’ble Superior Courts. In support, he has relied 
upon Muhammad Nadeem Arif & others v. Inspector-General of 
Police, Punjab, Lahore and others (2011 SCMR 408).  
4. 
Contrarily, learned Law Officer defends the impugned orders by 
contending that petitioner has failed to pinpoint any illegality or legal 
infirmity therein, thus, no interference is warranted.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
6. 
This case hinges upon the applicability or otherwise of the 
Regulation 23(e) of the PPSC Regulations, 2016, which for ease of 
reference is reproduced hereunder:- 
“A married female candidate may opt for the district of 
domicile of her husband till she acquires her own Domicile. 
In such a case she shall produce domicile certificate of her 
husband alongwith the evidence of her marriage.”

Writ Petition No.2412 of 2023 
 
7. 
In previous round of litigation, this Court specifically directed 
the respondents to re-consider the matter with reference to afore-noted 
Regulation, however, a bare perusal of impugned order dated 
23.08.2022 speaks otherwise and petitioner’s representation was turned 
down by observing as under:- 
“PPSC followed the Service Rules / Policy Decision while 
determining the eligibility of the candidates. Petitioner 
qualified the written test and called for interview on 
23.08.2022. As such, there is no discrimination / irregularity 
committed on the part of the PPSC.” 
 
The Policy Decision relied upon by the respondent-PPSC reads 
as under:- 
“A married female candidate may opt for the district of 
domicile of her husband provided she shall produce Domicile 
Certificate of her husband alongwith her previous Domicile 
Certificate, if she belongs to a district other than that of her 
husband, and also shall produce of her marriage. If she has 
no previous Domicile she shall be considered ineligible.” 
 
Notably, PPSC Regulations, 2016 were formulated by taking power 
from sub-section (2) of Section 10 of the Punjab Public Service 
Commission Ordinance, 1978 and these are subordinate and delegated 
legislation, deriving authority and legal cover from the provisions of 
the main statute. Regulation 3 of the PPSC Regulations, 2016 
authorizes the Commission to make Policy Decisions specifying 
detailed procedures for activities of the selection process and collateral 
matters, which reads as under:- 
“The Commission may make Policy Decisions to specify 
detailed procedures for activities of the selection process 
and matters consequential, incidental and ancillary. Such 
Decisions shall be incorporated in the Manual of Policy 
decisions.” 
8. 
It is evident from the above that Policy Decisions are meant to 
deal with details and can neither be a substitute for the fundamentals of 
the Regulations nor can add to them. To determine the vires of Policy 
Decisions of respondent-PPSC, this Court has to examine whether the 
same are beyond the power granted by the enabling Regulations or 
consistent therewith. The Policy Decision in question has imposed a 

 
4 
Writ Petition No.2412 of 2023 
 
further condition of having domicile of the candidate before her 
marriage for getting benefit of domicile of her husband. While 
Regulation 23(e) does not require the submission of earlier domicile of 
any married female candidate or rejection of her candidature in case 
she does not possess any earlier domicile. The beneficial Regulation 
23(e) has been qualified with a restriction leading to ineligibility of a 
candidate to be considered for appointment if she has no domicile 
before marriage. It is hard to imagine that the Policy Decision in 
question is elaborating the Regulation 23(e) ibid.  
9. 
The principles of delegated legislation entitle the delegatee to 
carry out the mandate of the legislature, either by framing rules, or 
regulations, which translate and apply the substantive principles of law 
set out in the parent legislation. They can fill in details but not vary the 
underlying statutory principles. It is observed that while making Policy 
Decisions, respondent-PPSC has to remain within the power given by 
the Regulations. The efficacy of the Regulations cannot be left to the 
mercy of Policy Decisions to be made by respondent-PPSC. Reference 
can be made to Khawaja Ahmad Hassan v. Government of Punjab and 
others (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 694), Suo Motu Case No.13 of 
2009 (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 619), Suo Motu Case No.11 of 2011 
(PLD 2014 Supreme Court 389), Muhammad Amin Muhammad 
Bashir Limited v. Government of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry 
of Finance, Central Secretariat, Islamabad and others (2015 SCMR 
630), Dr. Noor Homoeopathic v. National Council (1996 CLC 1687), 
Independent Newspapers Corporation (Pvt.) Ltd. And others v. 
Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2017 Lahore 289), Ms. 
Shagufta Hashmat and others v. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary Cabinet Division and others [2018 PLC (C.S.) 619] and 
Rida Fatima v. Pakistan Medical Commission and others (PLD 2022 
Lahore 197).  
10. 
Even otherwise, if a subordinate legislation is in conflict with 
the primary legislation, then it is void and ultra vires. Similarly, 
through a policy, a valid subordinate legislation can neither be made 

 
5 
Writ Petition No.2412 of 2023 
 
redundant nor superseded and no policy can be made in conflict 
therewith. Reliance is placed upon Muhammad Nadeem Arif’s case 
supra, Waseem Riaz and 119 others v. Ministry of Capital 
Administration and Development (CADD) through Secretary and 
another [2019 PLC (C.S.) 403] and Muhammad Yaqoob and another 
v. Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Secretary Land 
Revenue Department, Peshawar and others [2021 PLC (C.S.) 119].  
For facility of reference, relevant portion of the case of Waseem 
Riaz supra is reproduced hereunder:- 
“39. 
….. It is settled law that if a subordinate legislation is 
in conflict with the parent statute i.e. the primary legislation 
then it is void and ultra vires. Likewise, through a policy a 
valid subordinate legislation can neither be made redundant 
nor superseded let alone a statute enacted by the 
legislature. A primary legislation, therefore, prevails over 
subordinate legislation and no policy can be made in conflict 
therewith. Policies which are in violation of fundamental 
rights guaranteed under the Constitution or affect the 
interests of the public at large are void and, therefore, open 
to be challenged. Reliance is placed on case of “Watan 
Party and another v. Federation of Pakistan and others” 
[PLD 2013 SC 167].” 
11. 
For the reasons recorded above, instant petition is allowed in the 
manner that impugned letter and orders are declared to be illegal and 
without any lawful authority, thus, same are set aside. Respondent-
PPSC shall associate petitioner in the remaining part of the recruitment 
process as per applicable law, rules and regulations.
