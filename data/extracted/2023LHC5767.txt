ALI ZIA BAJWA, J.:- Through this constitutional 
petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter ‘the Constitution’), the 
petitioner has challenged the vires of the impugned order dated 
18.07.2023 passed by Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Model Town, 
Lahore, whereby the cancellation report prepared under Section 173 
of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (hereinafter ‘the Code’) in 
case FIR No.1660/2022, dated 07.07.2022, offence under Section 
489-F of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter ‘the PPC’), 
registered with Police Station Garden Town, District Lahore, was 
agreed with. 
2..  
 
The brief facts that led to the filing of the instant petition 
are that after the initial investigation by the first investigating 
officer, the investigation of this case was changed and entrusted to 
DSP/SDPO Tibbi City Circle, Lahore, who recommended the case 
for cancellation, whereupon, the cancellation report was prepared 
by the Station House Officer (SHO), Police Station Garden Town, 

W.P. No.58171/2023

Lahore on 25.12.2022 and the same was forwarded through the 
Superintendent of Police (Investigation), Model Town Division, 
District Lahore. The record reflects that said cancellation report was 
transmitted to the Magistrate by the concerned Prosecutor, which 
was agreed with by the Magistrate Section 30 Model Town Courts, 
Lahore vide impugned order dated 18.07.2023. 
3.   
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
4.   
Rule 24.7 of The Punjab Police Rules, 1934 (hereinafter 
‘the Rules’) deals with the cancellation of criminal cases. This rule 
envisages that no criminal case can be canceled without the order of 
a Magistrate of the 1st Class passed on a cancellation report duly 
submitted and forwarded by the concerned Superintendent of 
Police. The rationale behind this Rule is that a cancellation report in 
a criminal case should be filed through a senior supervisory officer 
to preclude the possibility of malpractice and arbitrariness on the 
part of the investigating officer. This precautionary measure has 
been provided in the Rules to ensure fairness and impartiality in the 
investigation process because if a cancellation report of a criminal 
case is agreed with by the concerned Magistrate, it amounts to the 
termination of that criminal case. It is incumbent upon the 
Superintendent of Police to forward the cancellation report after 
applying his independent mind, otherwise, the very purpose of Rule 
24.7 of the Rules shall be defeated.1 In the present case, the 
aforesaid Rule was not complied with in its true spirit. This fact was 
also admitted by the Superintendent of Police while submitting his 
reply before this Court that the cancellation report was forwarded 
without furnishing an independent opinion thereon.  The learned 
Law Officer present before the Court frankly conceded that the 
cancellation report was forwarded without furnishing any opinion 
or reasons by the concerned Superintendent of Police. It goes 
without saying that the office of the Superintendent of Police in the

W.P. No.58171/2023

scheme provided in the referred Rule is not merely a post office, 
rather is of vital importance to ensure fairness and transparency.    
5.    
It is further surprising that the Magistrate, while passing 
the impugned order, observed that there is no mandatory 
requirement to hear the complainant before passing an order on the 
cancellation report. No doubt that while agreeing with a 
cancellation report Magistrate acts on the administrative side but I 
am afraid that such findings by the Magistrate are against the 
dictates of law and violative of the principle of natural justice ‘audi 
alteram partem’. In particular, the rule expressed in the Latin 
maxim audi alteram partem requires no more than that the 
decision-maker should afford all the parties to a dispute an 
opportunity to present their case. The literal connotation of Audi 
Alteram Partem is to “hear the other side”.  It signifies that every 
party to a cause shall get an opportunity of hearing, and no one 
shall go unheard. The maxim Audi Alteram Partem is derived from 
the Latin phrase “audiatur et altera pars” which means that every 
party shall be heard. This maxim is one of the foundational rules of 
law that ensures justice for both sides. According to this maxim, 
every party shall have a chance to assert and plead his case.   
6.  
The maxim audi alteram partem is applicable to judicial, 
quasi-judicial and administrative proceedings. The principles of 
natural justice and fair-mindedness are grounded in the philosophy 
of affording the right of the audience before any detrimental action 
is taken. The decision maker has an adequate amount of decision-
making independence and the reasons for the decision arrived at 
should be amply well-defined, just, right and understandable, so as 
to ensure justice according to the tenor of law and without any 
violation of the principle of natural justice. The rule of justice 
embodied in the maxim audi alteram partem is not confined to 
judicial proceedings but extends to quasi-judicial and administrative 
proceedings, too. In Chief Commissioner, Karachi and another vs. 

W.P. No.58171/2023

Mrs. Dina Sohrab Katrak - PLD 1959 SC 45 a Full Bench of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan speaking through worthy Justice 
Shahabuddin authoritatively observed as infra: -  
“As a just decision in such controversies is possible only if the 
parties are given the opportunity of being heard, there can be as 
regards the right of hearing, no difference between proceedings 
which are strictly judicial and those which are in the nature of a 
judicial proceeding though administrative in form ……….” 
It is now beyond doubt that all the tribunals and administrative 
authorities while exercising quasi-judicial or administrative powers 
are also under an obligation to opt the above canons of judicial 
conduct. Thus, Lord Hewart's dictum in Rex vs. Sussex Justices2 
that “justice should not only be done but should manifestly and 
undoubtedly be seen to be done” is realized largely in its 
application to administrative adjudication.3 Further reliance in this 
regard can be placed on the cases titled “Mrs. ANISA REHMAN vs. 
P.I.A.C. and another – 1994 SCMR 2232”, “INSPECTOR 
GENERAL OF POLICE, QUETTA and another vs. FIDA 
MUHAMMAD and others – 2022 S C M R 1583”, “HABIB Bank 
LIMITED through Attorney Vs. MEHBOOB RABBANI – 2023 S C 
M R 1189” and “COLLECTOR CUSTOMS, MODEL CUSTOMS 
COLLECTORATE, PESHAWAR vs. MUHAMMAD ISMAIL and 
others – 2023 S C M R 1319”.   
7.  
The principle of audi alteram partem is read in every 
statute as its integral part even if not explicitly provided therein. It 
was ruled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan that “even in 
absence of any express provision in the statute, the principle of 
audi alteram partem is to be read into the relevant provision and 
applies in proceedings where adverse action is being considered 
to be taken against a person or if the contemplated action is going 
to affect any of his vested rights. The violation of this principle

vitiates the proceedings and makes the action taken therein to be 
illegal, as the violation of this principle is considered as a 
violation of law.”4 
8.  
It is also pertinent to refer to Rule 25.57 of the Rules 
which deals with the closure of the investigation and final report. It 
provides the procedure to be opted to inform the complainant by the 
investigating officer when a case is recommended for cancellation. 
For better understanding afore-referred Rule has been reproduced 
hereinafter: -  
25.57(1)_______________________________________ 
(2)__________________________________________ 
(3) If the informant is present when the final report is prepared, 
he shall be informed verbally of the result of the investigation 
and, after noting this fact in the final report, his signature or 
thumb mark shall be taken on it. If the informant is not present, 
he shall be informed in writing by postcard or by the deliver of a 
notice by hand, and the fact that this has been done shall be 
noted in the final report.  
In final (untraced or cancelled) reports the facts of the case 
which the investigating officer believes to be correct should be 
summarised, together with the grounds, for his belief. 
Information so recorded should be utilised for the completion of 
preventive records. 
A bare reading of the above-stated Rule makes it amply clear that 
this Rule applies to all kinds of final reports prepared, under 
Section 173 of the Code, at the conclusion of an investigation. It 
also includes a cancellation report and makes it mandatory for the 
investigating 
officer 
to 
inform 
the 
complainant 
of 
the 
conclusion/result of the investigation. His signature or thumb 
impression shall be taken on the final report. 
If the 
informant/complainant is not present, he shall be informed in 
writing by postcard or by the delivery of a notice by hand, and the 
fact that needful has been done, shall be noted in the final report. 
This Court observes that in addition to the abovementioned modes 
of informing the complainant, the investigating agency can take

benefit of the modern ways of communication to show its fairness 
and transparency. Such a process should be reflected in the final 
report and relevant police diary.  
9.  
The cancellation report prepared by the investigating 
agency in this case does not show that signature or thumb 
impression of the complainant/informant was taken or he was 
informed regarding the conclusion of the investigation which is 
violative of the aforementioned Rule and reflects mala fide on the 
part of the investigating officer. It is an axiomatic principle of law 
that when law requires a thing to be done in a particular manner, it 
should be done in that manner or not at all.  
10.  
It has been further noticed that the impugned order is 
non-speaking and the same was passed without furnishing cogent 
and plausible reasons and providing an opportunity of hearing to 
the complainant. Moreover, the concerned Magistrate without 
taking notice of the fact that the report was not forwarded to him in 
accordance with the law, agreed with the same. When confronted 
with the above legal proposition, the learned counsel for the 
respondent No.3 candidly submits that he has no objection if the 
impugned order is set aside and the matter is remanded back to the 
investigating agency. Before parting with the judgment, it shall be 
appropriate to formulate the guidelines for the investigating agency, 
concerned prosecutors and Magistrates regarding the preparation, 
forwarding and dealing with a cancellation report in connection 
with a criminal case. The following are the guidelines to be 
followed in the future by all the concerned: -  
I. 
When an investigating officer intends to close the investigation 
and prepares a report under Section 173 of the Code including 
a cancellation report, he shall inform the complainant/ 
informer, and his signature or thumb impression should be 

W.P. No.58171/2023 
 
7 
taken on that report in accordance with the Rule 25.57 of the 
Rules.  
II. 
All the reports prepared under Section 173 of the Code shall 
reflect that the needful was done and Rule 25.57 of the Rules 
was complied with in its letter and spirit. In addition to modes 
as provided in the aforementioned Rule to apprise the 
complainant/informer 
regarding 
the 
closure 
of 
the 
investigation and its result, modern ways of communication 
should also be utilized.  
III. 
The cancellation report prepared in every criminal case shall 
be forwarded by the Superintendent of Police concerned, who 
shall 
forward 
the 
same 
furnishing 
his 
independent 
opinion/reasoning to agree with the same. Guidelines already 
provided in the case titled Ehsan Ullah Chaudhry vs. The 
State, etc. – PLD 2023 Lahore 233 must be adhered to.  
IV. 
No prosecutor shall forward a cancellation report to the 
concerned 
Magistrate 
if 
the 
same 
is 
not 
duly 
forwarded/endorsed by the concerned Superintendent of 
Police. The concerned prosecutor should also forward the 
report while furnishing his independent opinion.  
V. 
The Magistrate, before adjudicating upon a cancellation report, 
must issue notice to all the concerned to provide them an 
opportunity for hearing to meet the requirement of the 
principle of natural justice audi alteram partem.  
11.   
 
For what has been discussed above, the instant writ 
petition is allowed and the impugned order passed by Magistrate 1st 
Class Model Town Courts, Lahore dated 18.07.2023 is hereby set 
aside. The case is remanded back to the investigating agency for 
filing a fresh report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. in accordance with 
the law. It is expected that the investigating agency and prosecution 
shall comply with the mandatory provisions of law in the future.
