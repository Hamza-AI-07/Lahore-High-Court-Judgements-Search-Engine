ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This winding up Petition is instituted by 
Petitioner No. 1 / Equity Master Securities (Pvt) Limited (the “Company”) 
in concert with Petitioners No. 2 to 4, the Chief Executive Officer and 
Directors of the Company in their capacity as contributories seeking to wind 
up the Company under the supervision of the Court in terms of Sections 301 
and 305 of the Companies Act, 2017 (the “Act”). 
2. 
 
It was averred that the Company, currently exiting under the 
Act, was incorporated as a private limited Company on 26.03.2008 under the 
Companies Ordinance, 1984. It is a licensed company authorized to offer 
services as a broker under license issued by the Security and Exchange 
Commission of Pakistan (the “SECP”) and as such, is permitted to 
undertake the business of buying, selling or dealing in securities through the 
Pakistan Stock Exchange (the “PSE”). The said license has been renewed 

2 
 
 
 
 
C. O. No. 14225 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
from time to time and lastly on 01.01.2023 till 31.12.2023 under Section 69 
of the Securities Act, 2015 (the “Securities Act”) and under Section 52 of 
the Futures Market Act, 2016 (the “Futures Act”). The Company has passed 
a special resolution dated 27.02.2023 for its winding up under supervision of 
the Court which was also filed in the Company Registration Office of the 
SECP. It was further asserted that due to difficult economic conditions, non-
receipt of due payments to the Company, expenses incurred on false and 
fabricated cases instituted against the Company, volatile securities business 
and loss of volume of shares traded on PSE due to Corona Virus pandemic, 
the equity of the Company had turned negative, as such, further losses are 
not sustainable, the Company has lost its substratum and is no more a going 
concern, therefore, its winding up is imperative and expedient being in the 
best interest of its shareholders, creditors and account holders. Hence, it is 
just and equitable to wind up the Company. 
3. 
 
Notice was issued subject to the question of maintainability of 
the Petition and SECP was directed to submit reply in collaboration with the 
concerned Respondents including PSE, Central Depository Company of 
Pakistan Limited and National Clearing Company of Pakistan Limited. 
4. 
 
Learned counsels for SECP and PSE posed a serious challenge 
qua the maintainability of this Petition in terms of Section 148 of the 
Securities Act by asserting that the Company and its contributories are 
barred to institute this Petition without satisfying the SECP that the 
Company has settled all outstanding claims of investors as per ‘Default 
Regulations’ of the PSE and have obtained prior approval of SECP in this 
regard. It was explained that an alternate mechanism under Rule 4.9 of PSE 
Rule Book is available to the Company to refer and deal with the matter of 
its default towards its account holders who invested in PSE through the 
Company and the institution of this Petition is an attempt to thwart the 
applicable regulatory mechanism provided by the PSE. This is particularly 
so when the Petitioners have also not informed PSE with respect to the 
passing of special resolution before filing the instant Petition as per 
applicable regulations of PSE which is a frontline regulator regarding 

3 
 
 
 
 
C. O. No. 14225 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
business of the Company. It was also apprised that SECP has also passed an 
investigation order dated 30.03.2023 under Section 139 of the Securities Act 
for investigation into affairs of the Company and the instant Petition is an 
attempt to frustrate the investigation process.  As such, pertinent facts have 
been concealed with mala fide intention to procure the winding up order. 
Hence, Section 308(2) of the Act should be invoked which empowers this 
Court to dismiss the winding up Petition if the Petitioners are found acting 
unreasonably in seeking to have the Company wound up instead of pursuing 
the special remedies available under the law.  
5. 
 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the 
Petitioners have instituted the titled Petition in accordance with the rights 
accorded to the Petitioners under the provisions of Sections 304 & 305 of the 
Act. The special resolution passed in this behalf was duly filing before the 
SECP. However, inaction on the part of the SECP to accord approval of the 
same cannot be read as non-compliance of Section 148 of the Securities Act, 
particularly, when it is in the best interest of the shareholders, creditors and 
account holders of the Company that the Company be wound up. 
6. 
 
In view of the serious objections qua maintainability of this 
Petition, it is imperative to address the question of maintainability at the 
outset. The Company is existing under the Act which is applicable to all 
kinds of companies including the Company. Section 293 of the Act 
prescribes three modes of winding up a company i.e. by the Court; or 
voluntary; or subject to the supervision of the Court. Section 294 of the Act 
describes liability as contributories of present and past members of the 
company in the event it is being wound up. Similarly, Sections 295 to 300 of 
the Act deal with the liability of Directors whose liability is unlimited, 
contributory having fully paid shares, nature of liability of contributory, 
contributories in case of death of a member, contributories in case of 
insolvency of member and contributories in case of winding up of a body 
corporate which is a member, respectively. Section 301 of the Act 
enumerates the circumstances in which a company may be wound up by the 
Court. It includes instances pressed by the Petitioners when a company by a 

4 
 
 
 
 
C. O. No. 14225 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
special resolution has resolved that it may be wound up by the Court or if the 
Court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable that the company should 
be wound up. 
7. 
 
Section 304 of the Act accords the right to institute a winding 
up Petition to a company or to any creditor or creditors or to any 
contributory or contributories or by all or any of the aforesaid parties 
together or separately or to the registrar or to the SECP or to a person 
authorized by the SECP in that behalf subject to the provisions of the said 
Section. This Section lists certain mandatory prerequisites which are 
required to be complied with by each category of persons authorized to 
institute a winding up Petition. In the case of a contributory, the 
prerequisites of Section 304 of the Act are that a contributory shall not be 
entitled to present a winding up Petition unless either the number of 
members is reduced, in the case of a private company, below two, or, in the 
case of public company, below three; and the shares in respect of which he is 
a contributory or some of them either were originally allotted to him or have 
been held by him, and registered in his name, for at least one hundred and 
eighty days during eighteen months before the commencement of the 
winding up, or have or devolved on him through the death of a former 
holder. Similarly, the prerequisite stipulated for a company to bring a 
winding up Petition are that it has to furnish with its Petition, in the 
prescribed manner, the particulars of its assets, liabilities, business 
operations and the suits or proceedings pending against it. 
8. 
 
Section 305(1) of the Act stipulates that where a company is 
being wound up voluntarily or subject to the supervision of the Court, a 
Petition for its winding up by the Court may be presented by any person 
authorized to do so under Section 304 and subject to the provisions of that 
Section. Sub Section (2) thereof casts a mandatory obligation upon the Court 
that it shall not make a winding up order unless it is satisfied that the 
voluntary winding up or winding up subject to the supervision of the Court 
cannot be continued with due regard to the interests of the creditors or 
contributories or both or it is in the public interest.

9. 
 
Admittedly, the Company is not an ordinary Company but a 
licensed Company which is engaged in the further regulated business of 
selling, buying and dealing in securities on PSE under the license issued by 
SECP. As such, the operations of the Company are subject to regulatory 
regime of PSE as a frontline regulator and SECP as an apex regulator which 
regulates the PSE as well as the Company. The Securities Act in this behalf 
is most relevant which has been promulgated to amend and consolidate the 
law for regulation of the securities industries, the protection of investors and 
for the matter connected therewith and ancillary thereto. Section 148 of the 
Securities Act, importantly is reproduced as under:- 
“(1) In the case of a licensed person which is a company, if it 
appears to the Commission that it is desirable for the protection 
of customers that the company should be wound up under the 
Companies Ordinance, 1984 (XLVII of 1984), the Commission 
may present a petition for it to be wound up under that 
Ordinance on the ground that it is just and equitable that it 
should be wound up and that Ordinance shall apply to such 
petition as it applies in relation to a petition presented under 
that Ordinance. 
 
(2) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies 
Ordinance, 1984 (XLVII of 1984), - 
 
(a) 
a licensed person shall not file a petition for 
winding up unless it satisfies the Commission in 
the manner prescribed that it has settled all 
outstanding investors claims as per default 
regulations and has obtained prior approval of the 
Commission and the Commission may, in the 
interest of the public or interest of investors, 
impose such conditions as it deems appropriate. 
(b) 
The Court may refuse to entertain petition for 
winding up of a company, if the Court is satisfied 
that- 
(i) 
requirements of clause (a) have not been 
fulfilled; 
(ii) 
petitioner intends to avoid or prejudice 
investigation of offences under this Act, or 
(iii) any other ground that the Court deems fit in 
the facts and circumstances of the case.” 
 

6 
 
 
 
 
C. O. No. 14225 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
10. 
 
Section 2(xix) of the Securities Act defines ‘Default 
Regulations’ to mean those provisions of the regulations which provide for 
the initiation of proceedings or other action if a clearing member has failed 
or appears to be unable or likely to become unable, to meet his obligations 
for all unsettled or open market contracts to which he is a party. Further, 
Sections 138 to 139 of the Securities Act confer powers upon the SECP to 
inspect and investigate the affairs of a licensed person. Similar powers are 
also vested with the SECP under the Futures Act. In short, a comprehensive 
regulatory scheme is available to scrutinize the affairs of a licensed person 
for the protection of rights and interests of stakeholders and investors. 
Section 174 of the Securities Act unequivocally provides that provisions of 
this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith 
contained in any other law for the time being in force. This provision makes 
it abundantly clear that provisions of the Securities Act being a special law 
applicable to the Company will pre-empt and take precedence to the 
provisions of winding up stipulated in the Act.  
11. 
 
Thus, the proposed decision of winding up of the Company 
taken by the Company in concert with the contributories must be analyzed in 
terms of all applicable laws and regulations. It follows from the above that 
the Company being a licensed person was not authorized to institute the 
Petition for winding up before satisfying SECP in the prescribed manner that 
it has settled all outstanding claims of investors as per Default Regulations 
and has obtained prior approval of SECP in this behalf. It is not refuted that 
a mandatory sanction of SECP was not obtained before instituting the titled 
Petition. It is also apparent from the record that SECP has invoked its 
investigative powers vested under Section 139 of the Securities Act against 
the Company and an investigation team has been constituted for this 
purpose. SECP through C. M. No. 115 / 2023 has also informed that the 
Company as a securities broker has defaulted against a host of its account 
holders and the victims are the public-at-large having unsettled claims 
against the Company. It is apprised that so far 197 claims amounting to Rs. 
416.73 million are outstanding as of 30.06.2023 and that the process of 

7 
 
 
 
 
C. O. No. 14225 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
investigation is being delayed due to pendency of the titled Petition. PSE has 
also maintained that the process of settlement of claims of the victims is 
being carried out as per applicable Default Regulations and in the presence 
of a comprehensive mechanism for settlement of claims of the investors 
within the ambit of PSE, the winding up Petition, which otherwise is not 
maintainable, is also not in the public interest. Therefore, it is established 
that this Petition is not maintainable having been filed in violation of Section 
148 of the Securities Act. 
12. 
 
The Petition has also been incompetently instituted by the 
Company and its contributories without complying with the prerequisites 
embodies in Section 304 of the Act for the reason that the number of 
members of the Company are not reduced below two which is one of the 
threshold prescribed under Section 304(a) of the Act for the contributories to 
maintain the Petition for winding up. The Petition is also not maintainable in 
terms of Section 304(e) of the Act on behalf of the Company since it did not 
furnish, in the prescribed manner, the particulars of its assets, liabilities, 
business operations and the suits or proceedings pending against it. A mere 
hand written one page was appended with the Petition which lists assets 
twice than the liabilities of the Company which is in complete contrast to the 
averments in the Petition that the substratum of the Company has been lost 
and it is not a going concern. The information is not only deficient but is 
also not substantiated on the basis of reliable documents such as audited 
accounts of the Company. The information is also in deep contrast to the 
information provided by the regulators which demonstrates that pertinent 
facts and particulars as required to be disclosed under Section 304(e) of the 
Act were concealed in the Petition with mala fide intention. As such, the 
Petition is also not maintainable on behalf of the Company. 
13. 
 
Therefore, it is safely concluded that the Company has 
defaulted with respect to its liabilities towards the account holders and 
others. ‘Default Regulations’ and investigation processes by PSE and SECP 
as regulators have already been triggered against the Company. Both the 
regulators have unequivocally opined that in the given circumstances, the 

8 
 
 
 
 
C. O. No. 14225 / 2023 
 
 
 
 
winding up of the Company is not in public interest. Rather, the right to 
institute the wind up Petition in terms of Section 148 of the Securities Act 
under the given circumstances now vests with the SECP. As such, the 
institution of the instant Petition is clearly an attempt on the part of the 
Petitioners to bypass the mandatory and special regulatory framework and 
evade their responsibilities and liabilities under the law. Hence, it is not just, 
equitable or in the public interest to wind up the Company particularly when 
other remedies are available to the Petitioners and they are acting 
unreasonably in seeking to wind up the Company instead of availing and 
pursuing the other remedy as ordained in Section 308(2) of the Act. 
Therefore, the instant Petition instituted by the Company and its 
contributories is not maintainable. However, SECP as the apex regulator 
may file the winding up Petition as and when in its opinion, it would be just 
and equitable to do so in terms of Section 148 of the Securities Act read with 
Sections 304 and 305 of the Act.  
14. 
 
In view of the above, the titled winding up Petition is dismissed 
and in consequence thereof, all pending applications having become 
infructuous are also disposed of.
