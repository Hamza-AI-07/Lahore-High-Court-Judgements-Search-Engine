Appeal, the appellants have challenged the validity of judgment 
dated 07.06.2024 passed by the learned Single Judge whereby 
Writ Petition No.57365/2023 filed by the respondent No.1 was

Brief facts of the case as contended by learned counsel for 
the appellant are that two posts of Professor of Urdu (BS-21) 
were advertised on 07.12.2017. In response to the said 
advertisement, two candidates including the respondent No.1 
applied for the said posts but after obtaining external expert 
evaluation reports and the interview of the candidates, the 
Selection Board unanimously found both the candidates as not 
upto the marks and decided to re-advertise the posts. Thereafter, 
the said posts were re-advertised on 23.09.2018 wherein three 
candidates including respondent No.1 applied for the said post.

The Sub-Committee instead of obtaining fresh external expert 
evaluation as required under Service Statutes Clause 6(5), 
decided to consider previous external evaluation report. The 
Selection Board on the report of the 
Sub-Committee 
recommended the respondent No.1 for appointment on the post. 
In 57th meeting, Selection Board made recommendations in 
favour of respondent No.1. The matter was placed in 71st meeting 
of Syndicate which unanimously remitted back the case for 
review. Under the direction of Syndicate, the Selection Board in 
its 58th meeting after hearing both the candidates unanimously 
decided to re-advertise the post. Again case was placed before 
Syndicate in 75th meeting wherein it was decided to get fresh 
external evaluation report instead of re-advertising it. In 81st 
meeting of Syndicate a dissent view was taken with regard to the 
recommendations of the Selection Board and under Clause 7(2) 
of the Service Statutes of Lahore College for Women University, 
the matter was referred to the Chancellor. The Chancellor vide 
order dated 17.01.2023 recommended that the post of Professor 
Urdu (BS-21) be re-advertised. Respondent No.1 challenged said 
order dated 17.01.2023, notification dated 04.07.2023 and 
04.09.2023 through Writ Petition [No.57365/2023]. The learned 
Single Judge in Chamber allowed the writ petition vide judgment 
dated 07.06.2024 and passed direction to the appellants to issue 
appointment letter of respondent No.1. Hence, this appeal.

Arguments heard. Record perused.

Admittedly, first advertisement for the post of Professor 
Urdu was published on 07.12.2017 and two candidates including 
respondent No.1 applied for the said post. After obtaining 
external evaluation report, the Selection Board in its 56th meeting 
unanimously decided to re-advertise the post by holding that both 
the candidates are not up to the mark for the post. The Syndicate 

 
I.C.A. No.39471/2024

in its 66th meeting approved the recommendations of the 
Selection Board. Subsequently, another advertisement of the 
aforesaid post was published on 23.09.2018 and three candidates 
including respondent No.1 applied for the post. The Sub-
Committee did not follow the prescribed procedure and decided 
to consider the previous evaluation report which is violation of 
Clause 6(5) of the Service Statues of Lahore College for Women 
University as in 57th meeting of Selection Board, the 
recommendations were given in favour of respondent No.1 as 
under: 
 “Recommendations: the above mentioned candidates were 
interviewed and Dr. Rehana Kausar D/O Muhammad Siddique 
was found suitable for the post of Profession Urdu (BPS-21) as 
per average marks. However, permanent members gave her not 
qualifying marks.” 
When this matter was placed in 71st meeting of Syndicate who 
unanimously decided to refer it back to the Selection Board by 
holding as under: 
“Item No.10 
Professor Urdu (BPS-21) (Review Case) 
Review Date: 05-11-2019 
With reference to the Writ Petition No.39468/2019 titled 
(Azmat Rubab Versus Chancellor), the Review Case of 
Professor Urdu was held on 05-11-2019. The member of the 
Selection Board gave chance to both candidates (Dr. Rehana 
Kausar & Dr. Azmat Rubab) to appear before the Selection 
Board. The said candidates explained their point of view 
regarding their appointments/ Selection Board. After that the 
members of the Selection Board asked them to write their 
statement, only Dr. Azmat Rubab gave in writing but Dr. 
Rehana Kausar refused to provide anything. After reviewing 
the rules & procedure for Selection, the Board unanimously 
agreed to re-advertise the post of Professor Urdu (BPS-21) on 
the basis that all the permanent members did not give the 
qualifying marks to Dr. Rehana Kausar in the meeting of 57th 
Selection Board. It was also noticed that the evaluation reports 
were considered for the interview held on 28th May, 2019 for 
the post of Professor Urdu (BPS-21) were previously obtained 
for the Post of Professor Urdu (BPS-21) advertised on 7th Dec, 
2017.

The members of the Selection Board also recommended that, 
for select any candidate (Teaching / Non-Teaching), the 
candidate must obtain qualifying marks (50%) independently 
by the permanent members as well as subject expert.” 
In 58th meeting, the selection Board decided to re-advertise the 
post on the ground that the sub-committee of the external 
evaluation has wrongly relied upon the earlier external evaluation 
reports. The relevant part of decision is reproduced as under: 
 “With reference to the Writ Petition No.39468/2019 titled 
(Azmat Rubab Versus Chancellor), the review case of 
Processor of Urdu was held on 05-11-2019. The member of 
the Selection Board gave chance to both candidates (Dr. 
Rehana Kausar & Dr. Azmat Rubab) to appear before the 
Selection Board. The said candidates explained their point of 
view regarding their appointments/ Selection Board. After that 
the members of the Selection Board asked them to write their 
statement, only Dr. Azmat Rubab gave in writing but Dr. 
Rehana Kausar refused to provide anything. After reviewing 
the rules & procedure for Selection, the Board unanimously 
agreed to re-advertise the post of Professor Urdu (BPS-21) on 
the basis that all the permanent members did not give the 
qualifying marks to Dr. Rehana Kausar in the meeting of 57th 
Selection Board. It was also noticed that the evaluation reports 
were considered for the interview held on 28.05.2019 for the 
post of Professor Urdu (BPS-21) were previously obtained for 
the Post of Professor Urdu (BPS-21) advertised on 
07.12.2017.” 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
Later on, the matter was placed before 75th Syndicate Meeting 
who directed to procure fresh evaluation report of the candidates 
as under: 
 “The Syndicate referred back the case of Professor of Urdu to 
the Selection Board with the directions to review the 
appointment of Dr. Azmat Rubab & Dr. Rehana Kausar as 
Professor of Urdu (BPS-21) along with fresh external 
evaluation reports of the said post as per procedure. After 
recommendations by the Selection Board/ Syndicate, the said 
candidate may be appointed from the date of the appointments 
made through the current (75th) meeting of the Syndicate.” 
The Selection Board decided to re-advertise the post whereas the 
Syndicate directed to take fresh evaluation report. Thereafter, in 
81st Syndicate Meeting the matter of appointment of respondent 

 
I.C.A. No.39471/2024 
 
5
No.1 was referred to the Chancellor. The said recommendation is 
reproduced as under: 
“Since as per recommendations of the 59th Selection Board, the 
post of Professor Urdu (BPS-21) should be re-advertised but 
the members of the Syndicate did not endorse the said 
decision. There is a conflict between recommendations of 
Selection Board and Syndicate as per Clause 7 (2) of the First 
Statutes appended with the Schedule of LCWU, Lahore 
Ordinance 2002; the case of both candidates (Dr. Rehana 
Kausar & Dr. Azmat Rubab) should be forwarded to Worthy 
Chancellor/ Governor of Punjab for final decision. However, 
the members of the Syndicate recommend that the Chancellor 
may kindly approve the appointment of Dr. Rehana Kausar as 
Professor Urdu as per decision of 57th Selection Board and her 
joining would be after the approval of Chancellor / Governor 
decision.” 
Due to dissent view, the matter was referred to the Chancellor 
under Clause 7(2) of the Service Status. The Chancellor finally 
directed to re-advertise the post. For ready reference, relevant 
portion of order passed by the Chancellor is reproduced as under: 
 “For what has been stated above, I, in exercise of powers 
conferred upon me under Statute 7 (2) of the First Statutes 
appended as Schedule with the Lahore College for Women 
University, Lahore Ordinance, 2002 am inclined to upheld the 
recommendations of the Selection Board made in its 56th 
meeting held on 4th & 5th November 2019 to re-advertise the 
post of Professor of Urdu (BPS-21). The University is directed 
to re-advertise the post of Professor of Urdu (BS-21), 
accordingly.” 
5. 
Further, in response of the first advertisement the 
respondent No.1 was not appointed on the basis of the external 
expert evaluation report. Thereafter, when the post was re-
advertised, the Sub-Committee while relying on the earlier 
external expert evaluation report, recommended the respondent 
No.1 for the said post which is patently illegal. Thereafter, the 
Syndicate decided to re-advertise the post. As per Clause 7(2) of 
the First Statutes appended as Schedule with the Lahore College 
for Women University, Lahore Ordinance, 2002 when there is 
difference of opinion between Selection Board and Syndicate, the 

 
I.C.A. No.39471/2024 
 
6
matter shall be referred to the Chancellor and the Chancellor is 
the final authority in such like matters whose decision cannot be 
questioned through constitutional petition.   
6.  
Even otherwise, it is settled law that it is not the domain of 
the Court to examine the qualification and the eligibility criteria 
in the recruitment process and such matters can be best resolved 
by the institution itself according to the suitability and 
requirements of a certain post. The Courts are not the substitute 
of a Selection Board or Syndicate and cannot direct an appointing 
authority to issue appointment letter in favour of any candidate 
rather can only direct the said authorities for reconsideration of a 
matter if any illegality or irregularity is found. Reliance is placed 
on a case cited as Muhammad Ashraf Sangri Vs. Federation of 
Pakistan and others (2014 SCMR 157) wherein the Hon'ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that “6….Essentially an 
interview is a subjective test and it is not possible for a Court of 
law to substitute its own opinion for that of the Interview Board 
in order to give the petitioner relief. What transpired at the 
interview and what persuaded one member of the Board to award 
him only 50 marks is something which a Court of law is certainly 
not equipped to probe and to that extent we cannot substitute our 
own opinion with that of the Interview Board.” In another case 
cited as The Secretary Punjab Public Service Commission, 
Lahore and others Vs. Aamir Hayat and others (2019 SCMR 
124) the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that “7… 
We also find that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction by 
issuing a direction to the petitioner that an appointment letter be 
issued to the Respondent against a post of Sub-Inspector (BS-14) 
on the basis of list dated 29.4.2016. By doing so, the High Court 
arrogated itself to the position of an appointing authority which 
is obviously and clearly beyond the scope of its jurisdiction while 
exercising powers under Article 199 of the Constitution.” Further 

 
I.C.A. No.39471/2024 
 
7
reliance is placed on cases cited as Government of Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa through Chief Secretary, Peshawar and others Vs. 
Hayat Hussain and others (2016 SCMR 1021) and Waheed Gul 
Khan and another Vs. Province of Sindh and others (2024 
SCMR 1701). 
7. 
Moreover, the recommendation for appointment of a 
candidate against a certain post exclusively falls within the 
domain of the concerned authority and interfering in that domain 
would amount to committing judicial overreach which is 
unwarranted by law. Reliance is placed on judgments cited as 
Chief Executive Officer, Multan Electric Power Company Ltd. 
Khanewal Road, Multan Vs. Muhammad Ilyas and others (2021 
SCMR 775). Further, as the Chancellor is the final authority in 
the matter in question who directed to re-advertise the post as 
such no prejudice is caused to anyone including the respondent 
No.1.  
8. 
For what has been discussed above, this appeal is allowed 
and by setting aside the judgment dated 07.06.2024 passed by the 
learned Single Judge in Chamber, Writ Petition [No.57365/2023] 
filed by the respondent No.1 is dismissed.
