Through 
this 
Constitutional Petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner has called 
into question validity and legality of judgments & decrees of the 
Courts below pursuant whereto her suit for recovery of dower and 
gold ornaments was partially decreed. Respondent No.3 through 
connected Writ Petition (W.P. No.15233/18) has also challenged 
these judgments, seeking dismissal of petitioner’s suit in toto. 
2. 
Tersely, necessary facts forming background of the 
proceedings in hand are that on 30.05.2017 the petitioner (Mst. 
Saima Sarwar) instituted a suit for recovery of dower, gold 
ornaments and maintenance allowance against the respondent 
No.3 wherein she maintained that marriage between the parties 
was solemnized on 27.12.2015 and at the time of Nikah a house 

W.P. No.5288 of 2019.

measuring 05 Marlas valuing Rs.15,00,000/-, gold ornaments 
weighing 03 Tolas and Rs.2,000/- was  fixed as her dower but the 
respondent No.3 failed to pay the same. She pleaded that the 
respondent is impotent and unable to perform matrimonial 
obligations but for the sake of honor of her parents she remained 
silent, however, the respondent No.3 ousted her from his house 06 
months prior to the institution of the suit. She claimed past and 
future maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.3,000/-.  
3. 
On the other hand, respondent No.3 contested the suit by 
filing a written statement in which he denied the claims of the 
petitioner. He asserted that she left his house of her own accord 
and, while leaving, took with her the jewelry, prize bonds, and 
clothing. He specifically rejected her allegation of impotency, 
stating that it was a false accusation. He claimed that he is fully 
capable of performing his marital obligations and that petitioner 
had even become pregnant but later she aborted three-month-old 
fetus.  Learned Trial Court framed necessary issues and invited the 
parties to lead their respective evidence.  
4. 
It is pertinent to mention here that on 16.10.2017 marriage 
between the parties was dissolved on the basis of Khula under 
Section 10(5) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, 
subject to surrender of 50% of deferred dower. Said order was not 
challenged by either party, hence, the same attained finality.   
5. 
After recording evidence of the parties pro & contra, oral as 
well as documentary, learned Trial Court vide judgment & decree 
dated 09.05.2018 partially decreed the suit of petitioner in the 
following terms:- 

W.P. No.5288 of 2019.  
 
3
"In view of my findings on above issues, the suit of 
plaintiff in respect of dower is decreed to the extent of 
half of the five Marla constructed house or its price i.e. 
Rs.7,50,000/- Whereas the suit to the extent of 
remaining claim of plaintiff i.e. recovery of gold 
ornaments and maintenance allowance is dismissed" 
6. 
Feeling aggrieved, respondent No.3 preferred an appeal 
which was allowed by the learned Appellate Court vide judgment 
& decree dated 22.09.2018 and findings of learned Trial Court on 
issue No.2 were modified in the following manner: 
"……the appeal in hand is allowed and findings of the 
learned trial Court on issue No.2 are modified to the effect 
that the respondent/plaintiff will get 1/4th of 5 Marlas 
constructed house or its price worth Rs.3,75,000/-." 
7. 
Being dissatisfied, the petitioner has filed above captioned 
Writ Petition with the prayer that by modifying judgments & 
decrees of Courts below her suit be decreed in toto, whereas, 
respondent No.3 has filed connected Writ Petition by praying that 
petitioner’s suit be dismissed.  
8. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
gone through the record with their able assistance.  
9. 
After hearing learned counsel for the parties and going 
through the record, it has been observed that marriage between the 
parties was dissolved on the basis of Khula by the learned Trial 
Court vide order dated 16.10.2017 under Section 10(5) of the 
West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, subject to surrender of 
50% of deferred dower. Neither of the parties challenged said 
order, hence, the same attained finality.  
10. 
Learned Trial Court vide judgment & decree dated 
09.05.2018 decreed the suit of petitioner only to the extent of 

W.P. No.5288 of 2019.

dower i.e. half of five Marla constructed house or its price 
Rs.7,50,000/-. However, learned Appellate Court, while accepting 
the appeal of the respondent No.3 modified the finding of learned 
Trial Court by observing that marriage between the parties was 
not consummated.  
11. 
It is an admitted position that at the time of marriage a 
house measuring 05 Marlas valuing Rs.15,00,000/- was fixed as 
dower. The petitioner proved her version during evidence by 
producing cogent and trustworthy evidence, hence, she is entitled 
to receive half of the dower as the marriage was dissolved on the 
basis of Khula subject to surrender of 50% of deferred dower vide 
order dated 16.10.2017.   
12. 
However, both the Courts below observed that marriage 
was not consummated and in the light of this learned Appellate 
Court further reduced the dower. Only point for determination 
before this Court is that whether the Courts below were justified 
in holding that marriage between the parties was not 
consummated.    
13. 
Perusal of the plaint reflects that although petitioner pleaded 
that the respondent No.3 is impotent and unable to perform 
matrimonial obligations but she neither specifically pleaded that 
the marriage was not consummated nor any specific issue was 
framed in this regard. Moreover, the marriage was dissolved on 
the ground of Khula rather than non-performance of marital 
obligations by the respondent No.3. In these circumstances, the 
findings of both courts on the question of non-consummation are 

W.P. No.5288 of 2019.

legally untenable, as such a conclusion could not have been drawn 
in the absence of proper pleadings or a framed issue.  
14. In Islamic law, consummation of marriage does not require 
proof of actual sexual intercourse; rather, it is legally presumed 
upon the occurrence of al-Khalwah al-Ṣaḥīḥah (valid seclusion). 
This concept, firmly established in Islamic jurisprudence, 
particularly under the Hanafi school, refers to a situation where 
the husband and wife spend time together in complete privacy, in 
a place where no third person can enter or observe them without 
their knowledge and where no physical, social, or Shar‘ai barrier 
exists that would prevent marital relations. When such seclusion 
occurs, Islamic law treats it as the equivalent of consummation 
(dukhūl) even if there is no direct evidence that intercourse took 
place. 
15. 
Under Muhammadan Law, the dower becomes confirmed 
by: 
(a)  
consummation of marriage; 
(b)  
valid retirement (khalwah al-ṣaḥīḥah); or 
(c)  
the death of either spouse. 
16. 
Thus, valid retirement carries the same legal effect as actual 
consummation. The essentials of a valid retirement are clearly 
defined which are that: a) the spouses must be alone in a secure 
and private place, b) free from any obstruction or disability 
(whether physical, mental, or religious) that would make 
intercourse impossible. Abdul Rahman, an authoritative scholar 
on Muslim personal law, explains: 
“The valid retirement which constitutes a legal 
presumption of the consummation of marriage, and 

W.P. No.5288 of 2019.  
 
6
perfects the wife's right over the whole dower, is that in 
which the husband and wife are alone together in a 
secluded place in which nobody can overlook them 
without their knowledge, and where the husband is free 
to have connection with his wife without let or 
hindrance.” 
 
17. 
Classical juristic works such as Kitab-ul-Fiqah and Radd-ul-
Muhtar reinforce this principle, recognizing that once the spouses 
assemble in such seclusion and no Shar‘ai impediment exists—
such as illness, minority, or ritual impurity—the law presumes 
consummation. The presumption is strong and does not require 
affirmative proof of physical union. 
18. 
The legal consequences of a valid retirement, as outlined in 
Radd-ul-Muhtar, are significant. Once khalwah al-ṣaḥīḥah is 
established: 
 the marriage is deemed consummated for all legal 
purposes; 
 the wife becomes entitled to the full dower (mahr), 
even if the husband is impotent; 
 the legitimacy of any child conceived thereafter is 
unquestioned; 
 the husband becomes obligated to maintain, clothe, 
and house the wife; and 
 upon dissolution of marriage, the wife must observe 
iddah, and the husband is temporarily barred from 
marrying her sister or certain other women. 
 
19. 
Once valid retirement is admitted or proven, allegations of 
non-consummation cannot be sustained without compelling and 
credible evidence to the contrary. 

W.P. No.5288 of 2019.

20. 
This is the agreed position of Jamhur (majority of jurists), 
including the Hanafi, Maliki and Hanbali schools that intercourse 
is not necessary for consummation of marriage and consummation 
occurs when the couple spends some time after the marriage in 
seclusion or privacy. This was also the opinion of the four Caliphs 
after the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) 
stated:- 
"The husband who lifts the veil of his wife (following Nikah), 
looks at her (privately), the mahr (bridal gift) becomes 
mandatory, whether he had intercourse with her or not." 
(Al-Dar Al-Qutniy)  
 
Ibn-e-Omar (may God be pleased with Him), said: 
“When the doors are closed, the curtains are drawn, and 
privacy is established, the full mahr becomes due, 
inheritance applies, and ‘iddah must be completed.” 
(Tafsir Al-Hawi). 
 
21. 
In the present case, it is an admitted position that the 
spouses remained together in matrimony for a continuous period 
of nearly eight to nine months. Once such prolonged cohabitation 
and shared marital life stand established, no question of non-
consummation can legally arise, particularly in view of the well-
settled principles of Islamic jurisprudence relating to al-khalwah 
al-ṣaḥīḥah, which create a strong presumption of consummation 
upon valid seclusion. The learned Courts below, while passing the 
impugned judgments and decrees, failed to appreciate this 
fundamental legal position and proceeded on an erroneous 
assumption that the marriage had not been consummated. Their 
findings are the result of patent misreading and non-reading of 

W.P. No.5288 of 2019.

evidence, and the judgments appear to have been rendered in a 
slipshod and mechanical manner, without proper consideration of 
the pleadings, admitted facts, or established jurisprudential 
principles. Such flawed conclusions, being contrary to law and 
unsupported by material on record, are not sustainable in the eye 
of law and warrant interference. 
22. 
As an inescapable consequence of the above discussion, this 
petition is allowed. Consequently, while setting aside the 
impugned judgments & decrees to the extent of non-
consummation of marriage, suit of the petitioner is partially 
decreed and she is held entitled to recover dower i.e. half of 05 
Marla constructed house or Rs.750,000/- as its alternate value as 
the marriage stood dissolved on the basis of Khula subject to 
surrendering 50% of deferred dower. Connected Writ Petition 
filed by respondent No.3 (W.P. No.15233 of 2018) is dismissed.
