W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
leadership of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi (respondent No.9), the Chairman 
of one of the largest political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (hereinafter 
referred to as “PTI”), on the basis of some political demands to be fulfilled 
by the Federal Government. The Destiny of the Long March was from 
Liberty Chowk Lahore to Islamabad, the Capital Territory. The participants 
of the Long March and their leadership when arrived at Wazirabad on 03rd 
November 2022, they were attacked by unknown assailants with firearms, 
one of which was arrested at the spot. Unfortunately, in the said incident, 
one citizen had lost his life and some got injured, including their Chairman. 
This incident resulted into a change in the object of Long March and also 
disrupted its normal course. Though a First Information Report (hereinafter 
referred to as “F.I.R”) was registered at the relevant police station qua the 
incident but it created panic in the camps of “PTI” as the leadership and 
workers are of the view that said “F.I.R” did not capture the actual facts 
and it is not in line with their expectations. This prompted the workers and 
second row of “PTI” leadership generally throughout Pakistan and more 
specifically within Rawalpindi region to hold demonstrations which 
includes sit-ins on entry and exit points of Rawalpindi as well as Motorway 
Interchange of Rawalpindi-Islamabad. The sit-ins started from 05.11.2022 
and continued till 11.11.2022 made it impossible for the citizens to enter or 
move out from the city through any means of transport. Those travelling to 
Islamabad from Murree Road were facing inconvenience while people 
going to offices and other destinations had been facing traffic jams in large 
numbers. Public and goods transport remained closed for six days due to 
the “PTI” sit-ins. Business in the area had come to a virtual standstill on 
Murree Road and other highways. Citizens including traders, students, 
doctors, paramedic staff, lawyers, government employees and patients had 
suffered a great deal from road blockades. Moreso, the life activity was 
practically paralyzed. The work of the courts within District Rawalpindi 
was affected practically due to the non-availability of the litigants and their 
counsel as they failed to attend their cases. Some of the participants of the 
sit-ins were armed with deadly weapons and they even were not shy to use 
the same to create deterrence for achieving their goals. This situation 
remained intact till 11.11.2022, until filing of these petitions, when by way 

3 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
of order dated 10th November 2022, in W.P.No.3253 of 2022 learned Law 
Officer representing the Province was directed to ensure the presence of the 
respondents i.e. Commissioner Rawalpindi, Deputy Commissioner, City 
Police Officer, Chief Traffic Officer and Senior Superintendent of Police 
(Operations), Rawalpindi as well as some responsible officer on behalf of 
Chief Secretary Punjab. On the next date, i.e. 11th November 2022, all the 
concerned officers were directed to submit their respective reports with 
regard to the matter in issue stating the facts as to at what points, the roads 
were blocked and what measures were taken till that time to ensure the free 
movement of the people in terms of Articles 9 & 15 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as 
“Constitution”). On the very same date, Senior Superintendent of Police 
(Operations), 
Rawalpindi 
and 
Deputy 
Commissioner, 
Rawalpindi 
undertook before the Court that they will ensure the free movement of the 
people, in the meanwhile. 
3.  
This was surely the turning point and thereafter almost all places 
and points were got freed from the protestors. On 16th November 2022, 
reports in terms of order dated 11th November 2022, were filed by Chief 
Traffic Officer, City Police Officer and Commissioner Rawalpindi 
Division, however, reports on behalf of Chief Secretary, Punjab Lahore, 
Inspector General of Punjab Police, Lahore, Regional Police Officer, 
Rawalpindi and Deputy Commissioner, Rawalpindi were also requisitioned 
on the said date alongwith a comprehensive report from Intelligence 
Bureau on the subject.    
4.  
The gist of the reports submitted by the respective departments 
is given below:- 
Ministry of Interior, Islamabad (Respondent No.1)  
It is mentioned that to review the overall law and order situation in the 
country in the backdrop of long march, a special meeting was held in 
which all the Chief Secretaries and Inspectors General of Police 
participated in which special instructions were parted to all the law 
enforcement agencies to tackle with the issue at hand through exclusive 

4 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
measures. Moreover, respective governments were asked to deploy 
requisite force to assist the NH&MP for keeping the national highways, 
motorways and link roads open. Moreover, a reference had been made to 
the Ministry of Law & Justice for furnishing constitutional/ legal opinion in 
the matter, however, the motorways and highways were cleared as a result 
of these efforts and the inconvenience of the public was averted. 
Chief Secretary Punjab/Home Department (Respondent No.2) 
It is reported that as per report of respondent No.3, after the Wazirabad 
incident, an abrupt emergence of protestors from almost all the suburbs of 
the city caused the blockade of roads at different points. This caused 
nuisance in the general public. Keeping in view of 2007 incident, the 
respondent No.3, alongwith District Administration, Rawalpindi took very 
cautious measures, it took immediate steps to handle the situation, 
coordinated with the Home Department, City Police Officer, Rawalpindi 
and the leadership of political parties. The police was ordered to re-
open/unblock the roads. The leadership of political parties was engaged to 
calm down the protestors. All the blocked points were reopened. The 
mobs/protestors tried to affect the smooth flow of traffic for three days, but 
respondent No.3 alongwith District Administration, Rawalpindi dealt with 
the situation time and again. The general public was kept informed about 
the prevailing situation on daily basis. The traffic was diverted to the 
alternative routes and the general public was directed to follow the new 
administrative instructions. Furthermore, social and electronic media were 
used to ease and inform the general public. Apprehending the law and 
order situation, the District Administration, Rawalpindi announced three 
days local holiday in Educational institutions for the safety of children. All 
the untoward situation was handled leaving no leaf unturned. At present, all 
the roads are cleared and open and there remains no hurdle in the smooth 
running of traffic flow. Government of Punjab is committed to ensure the 
fair and peaceful running of traffic and others administrative affairs within 
its jurisdiction in future as well. Further, Government of Punjab has acted 
in accordance with true spirit of law and judgements passed by the superior 
courts to protect the life and property of citizens in the Province of Punjab. 

5 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
Commissioner, Rawalpindi (Respondent No.3) 
It is reported that amidst the outcome of Wazirabad incident and in order to 
avoid 2007 like incident, stern steps to maintain the law and order situation 
were taken including announcement of three days local holiday in 
Educational Institutions of the City. 
Inspector General of Police (Respondent No.4) 
It is reported that pursuant to order dated 16th November, 2022 passed by 
the Hon’ble Court, reports were sought from AIG/Operations, CPO Punjab 
and Regional Police Officer, Rawalpindi. According to the report of 
AIG/Operations, CPO Punjab, on receipt of letter dated 26th October, 2022 
issued by Government of Punjab, Home Department regarding safety and 
security instructions Long March schedule to be started from 28.10.2022 
by “PTI”. Directions were then issued to the Addl: IGsP/Special Branch, 
CTD & PHP, Punjab, CCPO/Lahore, RPOs, Gujranwala, Gujrat, 
Sheikhupura and Rawalpindi, City Police Officers, Gujranwala and 
Rawalpindi and District Police Officers, Gujrat, Sheikhupura & Jhelum 
that a comprehensive strategy be adopted for the foolproof security of the 
participants during their movements/stay through Punjab to ensure the 
requisite precautionary and security measures as mentioned in the letter of 
Home Department.  
Regional Police Officer (Respondent No.5) 
It is reported that on receipt of order dated 16th November, 2022 passed by 
the Hon’ble Lahore High Court, report was sought from the City Police 
Officer, Rawalpindi. As per report of CPO, Rawalpindi, the members of 
the political party started protest against attack upon Chairman “PTI” and 
tried to block the roads in this district, due to which the traffic on the roads 
was badly affected. The blockade of roads by the protestors created law 
and order situation and it was apprehension that some untoward incident 
could be occurred due to which the protestors were handled carefully and 
urged to vacate the roads. Most of the protestors were camped near the 
roads which affected traffic flow and it gave semblance of the roads 
blockade. The district as well as Traffic Police managed the traffic 

6 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
blockade points by pushing the most protestors on one side of the road and 
the other side was cleared for the two-way traffic. However, once the roads 
got opened, different groups of protestors arrived and caused traffic 
conjunction. This continued for three days, however, traffic police gave 
alternate diversion routes to avoid inconvenience to general public. 
Moreover, criminal cases were registered at Police Station Taxila and 
Naseer Abad against the unknown protestors. It is further submitted that 
the general public was kept informed on daily basis about the prevailing 
situation and alternate routes of traffic through electronic as well as social 
media to provide maximum convenience. All the hurdles created by the 
protestors on the roads have been removed and now at the present all roads 
are cleared and there is no hurdle in smooth flow of traffic in the 
jurisdiction of district Rawalpindi. 
City Police Officer, Rawalpindi (Respondent No.6) 
It is submitted that due to Wazirabad incident, law and order situation of 
the country especially Punjab was disturbed. Heavy contingency of police 
was deployed to tackle the situation and with the collaboration of Traffic 
police, the protestors were pushed on one side of the road leaving the other 
side for free movement of the transport. 
Deputy Commissioner, Rawalpindi (Respondent No.7). 
Effective measures were taken including negotiation with the leadership of 
political parties to keep the smooth flow of traffic and general public was 
informed about the situation on daily basis through different modes.  
National Highways and Motorway Police  
It is mentioned that National Highways and Motorway Police has very 
limited mandate to administer and control the traffic related issues on 
Highways and Motorway, however, after the announcement of 
countrywide protest by a political party, detailed instructions were 
conveyed to the NH&MP field formations which includes, inter alia to 
maintain close liaison with the concerned SDPOs/NHA/FWO and also to 
remain in touch with the concerned SHOs of the District Police for 

7 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
ensuring deployment of sufficient contingents of police at main toll plazas. 
Their main focus was to maintain free flow of traffic, ensure the safety of 
commuters. It is submitted that for the purpose, special police wings in the 
shape of anti-riot force and police reserves have been established by the 
local police, while the manpower sanctioned for the National Highways 
and Motorway Police does not include such anti-riot wings or reserves. 
Therefore, in such situations, NHMP becomes heavily dependent on local 
administration and provincial police. 
5.  
In addition to the above, with consent of all in attendance, 
detailed report was requisitioned from Intelligence Bureau (I.B) vide order 
dated 16th November, 2022, which was submitted by the learned Law 
Officer in a sealed envelope on 23rd November, 2022. Though an immunity 
was solicited qua the said report but after opening of seal and examining 
the report and material placed in support thereof, I do not find any such 
material justifying extending of any privilege to the same, so the same may 
be made part of record. The report is not only comprehensive, supported by 
relevant material and nearer to the truth as well but contrary to the reports 
submitted by the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, Regional Police 
Officer, City Police Officer and National Highways and Motorway Police. 
As per said report, on 7th November, 2022, “PTI” activists blocked major 
roads leading towards ICT in the jurisdiction of Rawalpindi and Attock 
districts at different points. These blockades continued till 11th November, 
2022 on the following places/points: - 
a. 
Shamsabad, Murree Road, Rawalpindi in front of Allama Iqbal 
Park. 
b. 
Gulzar-e-Quaid, Old Airport Road, Rawalpindi. 
c. 
Pirwadhai Mor (Towards IJP Road), Rawalpindi. 
d. 
Motorway (M-2) Near Village Banjnial, Rawalpindi. 
e. 
Motorway (M-1) Near Islamabad Toll Plaza. 
f. 
Chak Beli Mor, GT Road, Rawalpindi. 
g. 
Mian Misyari Chowk, Murree Expressway, Tehsil Murree. 
h. 
Ratta Shah Chowk, Margalla, GT Road, Tehsil Taxila. 
i.  
Bypass GT Road, Tehsil Taxila.

W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
j. 
GT Road at Banth Adda, Tehsil Gujar Khan 
k. 
Rawalpindi-Kohat Road (N-80) at Dhok Maskeen, Fateh Jhang, 
District Attock. 
It is mentioned in the report that the protest was led by “PTI” 
MNAs/MPAs/ Provincial Ministers. The protestors managed to block all 
the major roads of Rawalpindi by taking advantage of their own 
government in the province (Punjab). No effective measures/actions were 
seen against them by the provincial government. It is also mentioned in the 
report that two FIRs were got registered at Police Station Taxila and 
Naseer Abad but against unknown protestors. It is also find mentioned in 
the report that on the intervening night of 9th/10th November, 2022, persons 
affiliated with Malik Taimoor Masood Akbar (MPA/“PTI”), Ammar 
Siddique Khan (MPA/“PTI”) and Mansoor Hayat (MNA/“PTI”) exchanged 
harsh words and later opened fire on each other. Resultantly, three persons 
of Ammar Siddique Khan Group got injured, which resulted into 
registration of FIR No.1464 dated 10th November, 2022 and a cross-version 
of the same date at Police Station Taxila.  
6.  
Heard. Record perused. 
7.  
The report and the material in the shape of snaps as well as CD 
alongwith report submitted by “IB” not only discloses the identity of the 
most of the protestors but the “PTI” MNAs, MPAs as well as Ministers of 
their ally government in the province. On the contrary, reports submitted 
by the Commissioner Rawalpindi, Deputy Commissioner, Rawalpindi, 
Regional Police Officer, Rawalpindi, City Police Officer, Rawalpindi and 
Home Department are too far from the truth. 
8.  
Before further embarking upon the matter in issue, it would be 
advantageous to have a glance of the relevant laws conferring power to the 
Civil Administration and the Police for dealing with law and order situation 
including the issue at hand. In order to institute a comprehensive system of 
civil administration in the Punjab for efficient administration, improved 
service delivery, better coordination, supervision and regulatory 
enforcement and for ancillary matters, the Punjab Civil Administration Act, 
2017 (Act III of 2017) (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 2017”) was 

9

11 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
10.  
It appears from the report submitted by the Commissioner and 
the Deputy Commissioner that they were perhaps oblivious of their duties 
as ordained under the “Act, 2017”. It is though mentioned in the report of 
Commissioner, Rawalpindi that steps were taken to maintain the law and 
order situation but practically there was nothing except declaring three 
days public holiday in educational institutions of the city. It is quite strange 
that as per report of Deputy Commissioner, he took effective measures 
including negotiation with the leaders of the political parties to maintain 
law and order on daily basis through different modes. It is thus apparent 
from their own reports that the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner 
have failed to discharge their duties, rather remained aloof from the critical 
situation and instead opted to assume the role of reconciliator or mediator, 
which is not the command of law. 
11.  
It would not be out of place to mention here that on 11th 
November, 2022, Capt. (R) Shoaib Ali, Deputy Commissioner, Rawalpindi 
and Waseem, Senior Superintendent of Police (Operations), Rawalpindi, 
while being in attendance, undertook before the Court to ensure free 
movement of the people whereafter most of the blocked points were freed 
by the protestors, which were surely on account of filing of these petitions 
before the Court.  
12.  
Adverting to the role of police, it is observed that as per 
command of the Police Order, 2002, the police has an obligation and duty 
to function according to the Constitution, Law and democratic aspirations 
of the people. The Police Order, 2002 was promulgated to reconstruct the 
police for efficient prevention and detection of crime and maintenance of 
public order. Chapter II of the Order lays down the responsibilities and 
duties of the police. Articles 3 and 4 are more relevant, which are 
reproduced below for the purposes of convenience: - 
3.   Attitude and responsibilities of police towards the public. It shall be the 
duty of every police officer to-- 
(a)   Behave with the members of the public with due decorum and 
courtesy; 
       (b)   Promote amity; 

12 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
(c)   Guide and assist members of the public particularly the poor, 
disabled or physically weak and children who are either lost or find 
themselves helpless on the streets or other public places; and 
(d)   Aid individuals who are in danger of physical harm particularly 
women and children. 
4.   Duties of police.– (1) Subject to law, it shall be the duty of every police 
officer to– 
      (a)    Protect life, property and liberty of citizens; 
      (b)    Preserve and promote public peace; 
      (c)    Ensure that the rights and privileges, under the law, of a person 
taken in custody, are protected; 
      (d)   Prevent the commission of offences and public nuisance; 
      (e)    Collect and communicate intelligence affecting public peace and 
crime in general; 
      (f)    Keep order and prevent obstruction on public roads and in the public 
streets and thoroughfares at fairs and all other places of public resort 
and in the neighbourhood of and at the places of public worship; 
      (g)    Regulate and control traffic on public roads and streets; 
      (h)    Take charge of all unclaimed property and to prepare its inventory; 
      (i)    Detect and bring offenders to justice; 
      (j)    Apprehend all persons whom he is legally authorized to apprehend 
and for whose apprehension, sufficient grounds exist; 
      (k)    Ensure that the information about the arrest of a person is promptly 
communicated to a person of his choice; 
      (l)    Enter and inspect without a warrant on reliable information any 
public place, shop or gaming-house where alcoholic drinks or 
narcotics are sold or weapons are illegally stored and other public 
places of resort of loose and disorderly characters; 
     (m)   Obey and promptly execute all lawful orders; 
      (n)    Perform other duties and exercise powers as are conferred by this 
Order, the Code or any other law for the time being in force; 
      (o)    Aid and co-operate with other agencies for the prevention of destruction 
of public property by violence, fire, or natural calamities; 
      (p)    Assist in preventing members of public from exploitation by any 
person or organized groups; 
      (q)    Take charge of lunatics at large to prevent them from causing harm to 
themselves or other members of the public and their property; and 
      (r)    Prevent harassment of women and children in public places. 
      (2)  Police officer shall make every effort to– 

13 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
            (a)  Afford relief to people in distress situations, particularly in respect 
of women and children; 
            (b)  Provide assistance to victims of road accidents; 
            (c)  Assist accident victims or their heirs or their dependents, where 
applicable, with such information and documents as would facilitate 
their compensation claims; and 
            (d)  Cause awareness among the victims of road accidents of their 
rights and privileges. 
      (3)  It shall be the duty of a police officer to lay information before a 
competent court and to apply for a summons, warrant, search warrant or such 
other legal process as may, by law, be issued against any person suspected of 
committing an offence. 
From the perusal of the above referred provisions of law, it is manifestly 
clear that it is primary duty of the police to protect life, property and liberty 
of citizens. The police has to ensure that the rights and privileges of the 
public shall be protected. As compared to the above, the police has played 
a role of silent spectator, rather remained as privy to the criminal acts of the 
protestors.  
13.  
It was though expected from the City Police Officer that being 
head of the police of the city district, he not only commands the force in 
performance of its duties but to assist the Court in digging out the truth but 
surprisingly, role of City Police Officer is not appreciable at all. He not 
only failed to perform his duties but tried to cover the deeds of protestors 
and their masters. Despite availability of overwhelming material, only two 
FIRs were registered against unknown persons under minor offences. 
Registration of FIRs was only an eyewash and actual culprits were even 
not touched till today though their acts were clearly covered under section 
6 of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997. Role of Regional Police Officer was also 
not different from the City Police Officer. In whole episode, he also 
remained as dysfunctional organ.   
14.  
 Since there was a disruption not only at the Highways but at the 
Motorways, more particularly at the entry and exit points, so role of 
National Highways and Motorway police can also not be ignored. For the 
purpose of safe driving on the national highways and for matters connected 
therewith or incidental thereto, the National Highways Safety Ordinance, 

14 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
2000 (XL of 2000) (hereinafter referred to as “Ordinance, 2000”) was 
promulgated. Chapter VII of the Ordinance deals with establishment of a 
police for motorways and national highways. Sub-section (1) of section 90 
empowers the Federal Government to establish a police force for 
performing police and traffic control functions on motorways and national 
highways and within such other territorial limits as it may, by notification 
in the official Gazette, specify. By virtue of sub-section (2) of section 90, 
the police force established under sub-section (1) is clothed with all powers 
of Station House Officer under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act 
V of 1898), Police Act, 1861 (V of 1861) and in additional thereto shall: -- 
(a)  regulate and control traffic on the national highways and prevent 
obstructions thereon;  
(b)  keep order on the national highways and prevent the contravention 
of any rule, regulation or order made under this Ordinance or any 
other law in force;  
(c)  maintain law and order on the national highways and take 
cognizance of offences committed thereon;  
(d)  determine and regulate the category and type of traffic permissible 
at particular times keeping in view the road, weather and other 
conditions; 
(e)  render all possible assistance to national highways users;  
(f)  undertake initial investigation in respect of offences committed on 
national highways and then transfer the cases to the concerned 
police station for investigation. Restrict or stop local police from 
investigation and transfer of case back to National Highways and 
Pakistan Motorway Police.  
(g) plan, budget and manage publicity, information and education 
campaigns for the purposes of maintaining good order and safety on 
the national highways;  
(h)  keep the highways clear from any encroachment and keep a look out 
for suspicious persons and criminals;  
(i)  take into possession any abandoned property for its disposal under 
the law;  
(j)  provide security to the travelers;  
(k)  develop and maintain a transport research cell and laboratory for 
the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Ordinance;  
(l)  act as the advisory body to the National Highway Authority for 
proper planning building and development of national highways;  

15 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
(m)  examine the feasibility, desirability and necessity of various 
facilities, hoarding, advertisements, etc. on or along the national 
highways from the security and traffic standpoint in order to achieve 
the objectives of this Ordinance, and take appropriate measures for 
its removal, closure or regulation;  
(n)  enlist and maintain motor vehicle examiners for checking 
mechanical fitness of transport vehicles and issue no objection 
certificates for registration and route permits in respect of vehicles 
plying on national highways.  
(o)  inspect and oversee installation of such other facilities on or along 
the national highways as are necessary for ensuring good order and 
safety of the public;  
(p)  employ experts and enter into contracts including service contracts 
for the purposes of this Ordinance;  
(q)  establish a competent licensing authority and driver testing facility; 
(r)  promote the setting up of proper driver training schools in the 
private sector and co-ordinate their inspection and supervision 
through Provinces.  
(s)  assist the Provinces in setting up such driving schools; and  
(t)  perform such other functions as the Government may, from time to 
time, require; 
Section 91 bounds down all the officers of the Police and Civil Armed 
Forces to assist the National Highways and Pakistan Motorway Police in 
discharge of its functions under the “Ordinance, 2000”. Section 94 
empowers the Federal Government to appoint any person to be Magistrate 
of the first class within the meaning of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 (Act V of 1898) for carrying into effect the provisions of the 
“Ordinance, 2000”.  
15.  
Contrary to the mandate of law as mentioned hereinabove, the 
National Highways and Motorway Police came with the plea that their 
primary function is the traffic management and its regulation and control 
on the National Highways and Motorway. It is also apprised on behalf of 
National Highways and Motorway Police that they are neither equipped 
with the anti-riot equipment, bullet proof jackets etc. and lockups for the 
detention of persons arrested. It is pleaded that due to these reasons, 
National Highways and Motorway Police is heavily dependent on local 
administration, provincial police and other civil armed force. This was 
surely a reason that an important organ of the State, which is supposed to 

16 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
protect the National Highways and Motorways from any kind of 
aggression, has become helpless and hostage in the hands of protestors. 
This is an eye opener for all of us.  On the one hand motorways are 
sometimes though used for strategic purpose as well but no solid measures 
have been taken for ensuring the safety and protection either of Highways 
or Motorways. It is observed that from its inception, the role of Motorways 
police was exemplary but with the passage of time, their efficiency like 
other departments has started deteriorating though still better from many of 
the Departments but it needs serious consideration of the concerned 
authorities, especially Inspector General of Motorway Police. The role of 
National Highway Police is, however, only illusory, which is not 
appreciable at all and needs drastic measures for improvement. 
16.  
It would not be out of place to mention here that in order to 
evolve the traffic management system in the cities, Punjab Police Traffic 
Wardens were appointed and a special traffic cade of the Punjab Police was 
created under Article 8 of the Police Order, 2002. In exercise of powers 
conferred under article 112 of the Police Order, 2002, the Punjab Police 
Traffic Wardens Service Rules, 2017 were framed. Rule 12 of the Rules 
ibid provides function and duties of the Chief Traffic Officer and Traffic 
Officer in the following manner: - 
(a) 
shall assist the Head of District Police in traffic management 
functions; 
(b) 
act as per guidelines, instructions and standard operating 
procedures for traffic management system issued by the Head of 
Traffic Police; 
(c) 
enforce the provisions of the Provincial Motor Vehicles 
Ordinance, 1965 and Motor Vehicle Rules 1969 or any other 
law; 
(d) 
monitor the performance of the members; 
(e) 
assist the members in regulating traffic on roads or choke points; 
(f) 
ensure proper deployment of traffic duties in the district; 
(g) 
conduct driving tests and issue driving licenses of all categories 
as per rules; 
(h) 
initiate traffic education and awareness programmes; 

17 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
(i) 
shall be responsible for working, discipline and conduct of the 
members; 
(j) 
coordinate with other departments and allied agencies for 
efficient working of traffic management system; 
(k) 
initiate Performance Evaluation Reports as determined; and 
(l) 
any other duties assigned by the Head of District Police 
regarding traffic management. 
Though a specific and exclusive function has been assigned to the traffic 
officers in the cities but with few exceptions they have failed to discharge 
their functions and duties as per mandate of law. It is generally observed 
that traffic wardens only play a role of silent spectator or guide instead of 
realizing their actual functions and duties. Their performance needs to be 
addressed by the Chief Traffic Officer at the priority and they should be 
reformed into the officers of a Law Enforcement Agency.  
17.   
Coming to the role of respondents No.8 and 9 being the General 
Secretary and Chairman of “PTI”, it is observed that though it is claim of 
the petitioners that they were in fact basic source of all this situation but no 
concrete or cogent material has been brought before the Court to 
demonstrate that said respondents have actively played any role for the 
commission of offences by the protestors. The allegations against them are 
generalized in nature. At the same time, it was expected from both the 
respondents that they being the leaders of one of the largest parties of the 
country should have condemned the acts of their followers. Instead, 
respondent No.8, in a public gathering held during the pendency of this 
petition, tried to defend the illegal and unlawful acts of the protestors and 
in doing so, he had uttered certain remarks against the superior judiciary on 
account of which he was issued a show cause notice by way of order dated 
5th December, 2022. Respondent No.8 in pursuant to the order of the court 
entered his appearance on 7th December, 2022 and tendered unconditional 
apology, which was accepted and show cause notice was recalled.  
18.  
Right to assemble peacefully is a fundamental right of every 
citizen guaranteed under Article 16 of the “Constitution” but such right is 
neither unbridled nor unlimited. Article 16 though guarantees such right 
but it is always subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law in respect 

18 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
of public order. A citizen who claims right of freedom of assembly for 
himself/herself has to keep in mind the fundamental rights of the other 
citizens, guaranteed under the “Constitution” e.g. security of person, 
freedom of movement, trade business and profession. Guidance in this 
respect can be sought from Watan Party and another v. Federation of 
Pakistan and others (2011 KLR Supreme Court 298). The relevant 
extract from the same is reproduced below: - 
 
 
“4.   Article 14 of the Constitution of Pakistan ensures dignity of 
every individual. In the case of ‘Commissioner of Income Tax v. Eli Lilly 
Pakistan’ reported as 2009 SCMR 1279, this Court observed that:  
“It is the duty and obligation of the State on account of the 
various provisions of the Constitution to provide the atmosphere 
based on honesty by providing equal protection of law. Every 
citizen must be treated equally, dignity of human being life  
should be maintained, and liberty of life and honour must be 
guaranteed as envisaged in the Articles 9, 14 and 25 of the 
Constitution.” 
   
5.   Articles 15 and 18 of the Constitution, respectively relate to 
freedom of movement etc. and freedom of trade, business or profession 
and have been interpreted  by this Court in the case titled “Government 
of Pakistan v. Zamir Ahmad” reported as PLD 1975 SC 667, in the 
following words: – 
“Article 18 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which relates to the 
freedom of trade, business or profession, which corresponds to 
Article 15 of  the interim Constitution, and which incidentally 
held the field at the relevant time, assures the citizens the right to 
enter upon any “lawful profession of occupation” and “to 
conduct any lawful trade or business”. It is important to point 
out that the word “lawful” qualifies the right of the citizen in the 
relevant field. This clearly envisages that the State can by law 
ban a profession, occupation, trade or business by declaring it to 
be unlawful which in common parlance means anything 
forbidden by law. Prostitution, trafficking in women, gambling, 
trade in narcotics or dangerous drugs are common place 
instances of unlawful profession or trade. These are inherently 
dangerous to public health or welfare. Therefore, on the wording 
of Article 18 of the Constitution, the right to enter upon a 
profession or occupation or to conduct trade or business can 
hardly be described to be a Constitutional or Fundamental Right 
when such right may be denied by law. In this respect our 
Constitution stands in sharp contrast with the corresponding 
provision of the Indian Constitution which omits the use of word 
“lawful” in the relevant Provision.” 
    
The same principle was enunciated by this Court in the case of 
Arshad Mehmood  (supra). This Court observed  that the Government 
has the authority to regulate a lawful business or trade. Reasonable 
restriction, however, does not mean prohibition or prevention completely. 

19 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
Article 24(1) of the Constitution envisages that no person shall be 
deprived of his property save in accordance with law. 
    
6.   Any democratic set up consisting of citizens and 
functionaries in the country under the Constitution is bound to show its 
loyalty to the State, for to be loyal and faithful to the State is the basic 
duty of every citizen under Article 5 of the Constitution. This Court in the 
case of  Shahid Orakzai v. Pakistan through Secretary Law (PLD 2011 
SC 365) held that Article 5(2) of the Constitution has mandated that 
obedience to the Constitution and law is the inviolable obligation of 
every citizen wherever he may be and for every other person for the time 
being within Pakistan. The chosen representatives, who have acquired 
authority on behalf of their electors as members of the National 
Assembly, Senate or Provincial Assemblies as per mandate of their oath, 
which they take before entering upon office, are bound to bear true faith 
and allegiance to Pakistan. The oath of the office of members of the 
National Assembly and Senate as set out in the Third Schedule provides 
that the members will perform their functions honestly, to the best of their 
ability, faithfully and in accordance with the Constitution and law; that 
they will act in the interest of the sovereignty, integrity, solidarity, well-
being and prosperity of Pakistan and they will preserve, protect and 
defend the Constitution. Therefore, while holding a constitutional office, 
the chosen representatives of the people have to remain true to their oath 
and to observe constitutional limits in all circumstances.” 
19.  
Sit-in (درھن ا) has become a common phenomenon and fusty trend 
in Pakistan. It has now become a source/weapon not only with the political 
parties but every segment of society having followers/ members/ 
companions to stage a sit-in for their demands so as to exert pressure upon 
the executive/state to fulfill their demands, leaving aside all the legal 
course provided under the law. This trend has led the country to 
destabilization. In civilized countries, nobody can be allowed to take the 
law in his/her own hands irrespective of the fact how much the worst 
condition is. Pakistan is perhaps the only country in which the law 
enforcement agencies/executive, instead of defending the cause of the State 
and maintaining its writ, join hands with the persons/groups, who intend to 
erode the sovereignty of the State or to create lawlessness on extraneous 
reasons. It is not the first time in the history of country that such incident 
had taken place. In recent past, when the members of Tehrik-e-Labbaik 
Pakistan (TLP) and its supporters occupied a road junction (interchange) 
known as the ‘Faizabad Interchange’, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan took suo motu notice as Suo Motu Case No.7 of 2017 reported as 
SUO MOTU CASE NO.7 OF 2017 (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 318). In 

20 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
the said judgment, the Hon’ble Apex Court after taking into consideration 
all the material facts passed the following declarations and directions: - 
“53…. 
(1) 
… 
(2) 
Every citizen and political party has the right to assemble and 
protest provided such assembly and protest is peaceful and complies 
with the law imposing reasonable restrictions in the interest of public 
order. The right to assemble and protest is circumscribed only to the 
extent that it infringes on the fundamental rights of others, including 
their right to free movement and to hold and enjoy property.  
(3) 
Protestors who obstruct people's right to use roads and 
damage or destroy property must be proceeded against in accordance 
with the law and held accountable. 
(4) 
…. 
(5) 
….. 
(6) 
The State must always act impartially and fairly. The law is 
applicable to all, including those who are in government and 
institutions must act independently of those in government. 
(7) 
… 
(8) 
…. 
(9) 
…. 
(10) 
…. 
(11) 
…. 
(12) 
…. 
(13) 
Intelligence agencies should monitor activities of all those       
who threaten the territorial integrity of the country and all those who 
undermine the security of the people and the State by resorting to or 
inciting violence. 
(14) 
…. 
(15) 
….. 
(16) 
The police and other law enforcement agencies are directed to 
develop standard plans and procedure with regard to how best to 
handle rallies, protests and dharnas, and ensure that such plans/ 
procedures are flexible enough to attend to different situations. It is 
clarified that though the making of such plans/ procedures is not 
within the jurisdiction of this Court however we expect that in the 
maintenance of law and order every effort will be taken to avoid 
causing injury and loss of life. 
Had the above directions been complied with by the relevant authorities, 
the present incident would have not happened. 

21 
 
W.P.No.3256 of 2022 
 
 
20.  
In the wake of above discussion, it is observed that though all 
the entry and exit points which were blocked by the protestors have been 
opened by their own or with the intervention of the administration during 
the pendency of these petitions but this would neither absolve the 
protestors and their allies from criminal liability nor the executive 
authorities/officers from their failure to discharge their duties. All these 
petitions are, thus, disposed of with the direction to the officers of Civil 
Administration, Police, National Highways and Motorway Police, City 
Traffic Police, Secretaries concerned of the Federal and Provincial 
Governments to evolve a mechanism for ensuring that no such incident 
shall take place in future. They shall also adhere the relevant laws in true 
spirit. All the relevant offices/authorities/officers shall also ensure the 
compliance of directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case referred hereinabove.  
21.  
Before parting, it is observed that since the Commissioner, 
Deputy Commissioner, Regional Police Officer, City Police Officer and 
Chief Traffic Officer have miserably failed to discharge their official duties 
in terms of relevant laws and instead acted as privy to the illegal acts, so 
their matter is referred to the Secretary Establishment, Government of 
Pakistan and Chief Secretary, Punjab, who shall probe into their conduct 
and proceed against them strictly in accordance with law. They are directed 
to hold an inquiry in order to examine the conduct and evaluate the 
efficiency and discipline of all these officers. The proceedings to this effect 
shall be initiated and materialized within three months from the date of 
receipt of instant order under intimation to the Additional Registrar (Judl.) 
of this Court, who shall on receipt of the report place it before the Court for 
perusal. 
22.  
Office is directed to circulate this judgment amongst: - 
i.

ii. 
Chief Secretary, Punjab.  
iii.
