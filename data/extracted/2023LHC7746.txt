Raheel Kamran J:- This application 
under section 115 CPC seeks revision of order dated 
31.05.2023 passed by the Civil Judge 1st Class (Special Court 
for Admin. Commercial Cases), Lahore whereby suit for 
recovery of Rs.851,170,923/- along with specific performance 
of contract filed by respondents No.1 & 2 was considered as 
commercial case. 
2.       Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the 
impugned order is without jurisdiction inasmuch as the Civil 
Judge has acted contrary to the mandate of Rule 10, Part-K, 
Chapter-1, Volume-I of the Rules and Orders of the Lahore 
High Court, Lahore while treating the suit for recovery filed by 
the respondents as commercial case.  He maintains that rule 10 
ibid cannot operate in vacuum unsupported by any law as the 
Punjab Commercial Courts Ordinance, 2021 (‘the Ordinance’) 
which was promulgated on 13.04.2021 stood repealed on 

2 
C.R.No.54865 of 2023 
12.06.2021 in terms of Article 128(2) of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (‘the Constitution’) 
whereas suit in the instant case was instituted after such repeal 
on 14.09.2022.  He finally contends that no Court can assume 
and exercise jurisdiction which is not vested in it by law, as 
mandated under Article 175(2) of the Constitution. 
3.       Conversely, learned counsel for respondents No.1 & 2 
contends that Commercial Courts exercising jurisdiction in the 
instant case were in fact constituted prior to promulgation of 
the Ordinance in April 2020.  He maintains that no proceedings 
in the Commercial Courts were carried out pursuant to the 
Ordinance and the same continued under the notification for 
the reason that the procedure contemplated under the 
Ordinance required leave to appear and defend as opposed to 
right of defence available to a party under the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 and for all practicable purposes the Ordinance 
was never implemented.  According to him, the notification 
dated 28.02.2020 and other similar notifications have been 
issued in exercise of authority conferred by Article 203 of the 
Constitution and section 14 of the Punjab Civil Courts 
Ordinance, 1962.  He further contends that the very purpose for 
commercialization of the cases is expeditious disposal of the 
same and this Court adopted such course pursuant to the 
National Judicial Policy 2009 as manifest from Paras 15 & 16 
thereof.  While referring to rule 10, Part-K, Chapter-1, 
Volume-I of the Rules and Orders of the Lahore High Court, he 
states that plaintiff may apply for his/her case to be treated as 
commercial case for expeditious disposal thereof.  He further 
contends that on all objections taken by the petitioners, issues 
have already been framed by the trial Court, therefore, it may 
approach the Court with appropriate application for treating 
any of the said issues as preliminary issue, if it could be done 
so.  According to him, most of the pleas raised by the 

3 
C.R.No.54865 of 2023 
petitioners involve either factual dispute or mixed question of 
law and facts which could not be resolved without recording 
evidence nonetheless the petitioners may approach the Court of 
competent jurisdiction for treating any issue as preliminary in 
accordance with law.  According to him, no objection qua 
jurisdiction over the subject matter, territorial jurisdiction or 
pecuniary jurisdiction has been raised in the matter, hence, the 
titled revision is incompetent.   
4. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioners has 
referred to page 33 of the titled civil revision to contend that 
Commercial Courts established in the instant case were 
pursuant to the Punjab Commercial Courts Ordinance, 2021.  
He contends that notification dated 28.04.2020 was in fact 
issued in the year 2021 and mention of the year 2020, 
therefore, is a typographical error.   
5. 
Learned Additional Advocate General contends that 
doing business is a flagship report of the World Bank Group 
wherein 190 economies are ranked on their ease of doing 
business for an overall ten indicators, including enforcing 
contracts.  He maintains that according to the latest ease of 
doing business ratings, Pakistan is overall ranked at No.108 
among 190 economies and holds the 156th position on 
‘enforcing contracts’ indicator.  He further contends that while 
obtaining guidance from Chapter-1, Part-K, Rules 10 and 11, 
Volume-I of Rules and orders of the Lahore High Court, 
Lahore, on 28.04.2020 this Court notified one Additional 
District Judge and two Civil Judges at Lahore to exclusively 
adjudicate upon commercial cases and similarly in four other 
districts i.e. Multan, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Faisalabad, 
one Additional District Judge and one Civil Judge were 
designated for such purpose.  He adds that even under section 
15 of the Punjab Civil Courts Ordinance, 1962 the District 
Judge is empowered to allocate to any Judge of the subordinate 

4 
C.R.No.54865 of 2023 
Court any business i.e. any type of case that he deems fit 
provided the same is not beyond his jurisdiction altogether.  
According to him, the Sindh High Court vide notification dated 
05.11.2020 has also designated individual Judges/Courts of the 
District Judiciary as Commercial Courts to handle commercial 
cases under the High Court Rules and Orders.  He finally 
contends that this Court, through Rules and Orders of the 
Lahore High Court and the Punjab Civil Courts Ordinance, 
1962 is vested with lawful authority to establish Courts that 
specifically deal with matters of commercial nature. 
6. 
Arguments heard.  Record perused. 
7. 
It is case of the petitioners that functioning of 
Commercial Courts is without any backing of law and in 
particular after repeal of the Punjab Commercial Courts 
Ordinance, 2021 the same is legally invalid.  In order to secure 
expeditious disposal of cases of commercial nature, the Lahore 
High Court vide its notification No.6032 DDJ/DR(PD&IT) 
dated 28.04.2020 designated one court of Additional District & 
Sessions Judge, Lahore and two courts of Civil Judges to hear 
and dispose of the said cases with further direction to the 
District & Sessions Judges, Multan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala 
and Rawalpindi to entrust the work of commercial cases 
pertaining to their districts to the Judicial Officers already 
dealing with the Overseas Pakistanis’ cases.  Rule 10, Part-K, 
Chapter-1, Volume-I of Rules and Orders of the Lahore High 
Court, Lahore provides that commercial cases should be 
disposed of as speedily as practicable, which are to include 
cases arising out of ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers 
and traders.  The said rule is reproduced hereunder for ready 
reference: - 
“10. 
Commercial 
Cases.--“Commercial 
Cases” 
should be disposed of as speedily as practicable.  The term 
“Commercial Case” is taken to include cases arising out of 
the ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers and traders, 

5 
C.R.No.54865 of 2023 
amongst others those relating to the construction of 
mercantile documents, export or import of merchandise, 
affreightment, carriage of goods by land, insurance, banking 
and mercantile agency, and mercantile usage, and debts 
arising out of such transactions. 
A plaintiff or appellant may apply at the preliminary 
hearing at which his plaint or appeal is admitted or by 
subsequent application before the final hearing thereof, to 
have his case classed as a “Commercial Case”, and the 
Court before which such application is made shall, if 
satisfied that the case is a Commercial case, as defined in 
the above paragraph, cause the appeal or plaint to be 
marked with the words “Commercial Case”. 
All cases which have been marked as “Commercial 
Cases” under the preceding paragraph shall be brought to a 
hearing as early as may be practicable.  Such cases shall be 
given priority on the day of hearing over other cases, except 
part heard cases, and shall, so far as possible be heard from 
day to day until they are finally decided.” 
 
Rules and Orders have been framed by the Lahore High Court 
in accordance with Article 202 of the Constitution that 
empowers it to do so subject to the Constitution.  Article 203 of 
the Constitution envisages that each High Court shall supervise 
and control all courts subordinate to it with the object to 
establish orderly, honorable, upright, impartial and legally 
correct administration of justice1.  The supervision and control 
over the subordinate judiciary vested in the High Courts under 
Article 203 of the Constitution is exclusive in nature, 
comprehensive in extent and effective in operation2.    
8. 
The contention of the petitioners’ counsel that the 
Commercial Courts were established pursuant to the 
promulgation of the Ordinance and the year of issuance of the 
aforementioned notification was 2021 instead of 2020 is 
apparently based on misconception inasmuch as the official 
website of the Lahore High Court still shows the same 
notification dated 28.04.2020 and a judgment of this Court in 
the case of M.C.R. (Pvt.) Ltd. Franchisee of Pizza Hut v. 
                                                 
1 Messrs Shaheen Air International Ltd. (SAI) and others v. Messrs Voyage De Air and  
  others (2006 SCMR 1684) 
2 Sh. Liaqat Hussain and others v. Federation of Pakistan & others (PLD 1999 SC 504) 

6 
C.R.No.54865 of 2023 
Multan Development Authority and others (2021 CLD 639) 
rendered on 08.03.2021 relies on the same notification having 
the date as 28.04.2020.  The said notification also does not 
show that the courts were being designated as Commercial 
Courts in accordance with the Ordinance.  Therefore, it is quite 
clear that the subject notification was issued on 28.04.2020 
prior to the promulgation of the Ordinance and its repeal has no 
legal effect upon functioning of the Commercial Courts.  Even 
as per Rule 10 referred above, a plaintiff or appellant may 
apply at the time of preliminary hearing or by subsequent 
application before the final hearing thereof to have its case 
classed as commercial case.  
9. 
Furthermore, the courts of ordinary civil jurisdiction 
have been designated to hear and dispose of the commercial 
cases that are dealing with the same in accordance with the 
procedure provided under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
with the sole object to ensure expeditious disposal of the same 
on priority basis.  Thus, for all practicable purposes all courts 
designated as Commercial Courts under the notification dated 
28.04.2020 are essentially Civil Courts exercising jurisdiction 
under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for expeditious 
disposal of civil disputes.  By considering a case as commercial 
one, the right of fair trial available to the opposite party is not 
being compromised since no special procedure has been laid 
down to dispose of the same.   On being confronted as to what 
prejudice is being caused to the petitioners because of hearing 
and adjudication of the titled case by the Civil Judge 
designated as Commercial Court, learned counsel for the 
petitioners has not been able to point out any. 
10. 
In view of the foregoing, the courts designated to hear 
cases of commercial nature are functioning in accordance with 
the CPC and the Rules and Orders of the Lahore High Court 
under its superintendence and control within the scope of 

7 
C.R.No.54865 of 2023 
Articles 202 & 203 of the Constitution and this Court does not 
find any illegality or irregularity in the impugned order 
warranting interference in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.  
Resultantly, this civil revision is devoid of any merit and is 
accordingly dismissed.
