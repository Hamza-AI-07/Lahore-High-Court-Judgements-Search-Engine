JUDGMENT. 
 
  
 
 
 
Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. This constitutional petition emanates 
from a suit for recovery of maintenance instituted by respondent No.1 
(hereinafter referred to as “respondent”). Suit was decreed ex-parte vide 
judgment dated 17th March, 2016. The petitioner moved an application for 
setting aside ex-parte decree but it was dismissed vide order dated 3rd 
February, 2018, being barred by time. Feeling dissatisfied, the petitioner 
though filed an appeal before the learned Additional District Judge, 
Chakwal but remained unsuccessful as the appeal was dismissed through 
judgment dated 30th July, 2018. 
2.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the petitioner 
was never served with the process of the Court. He added that on attaining 
the knowledge about the ex-parte decree, the petitioner immediately moved 
an application seeking setting aside of the same but it was dismissed being 
barred by time. Learned counsel submitted that the petitioner feeling 
aggrieved though preferred an appeal but appeal was also dismissed in a 
mechanical manner. It is emphatically contended that both the Courts 
while dismissing the application have erred in law. 
Date of hearing: 
23.11.2023 
 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Abdul Masood Awan, Advocate

3.  
Conversely, learned counsel for the “respondent” defended the 
impugned judgment as well as order and submitted that the petitioner 
remained indolent and intentionally avoided his appearance. Learned 
counsel added that the application for setting aside ex-parte decree was 
rightly dismissed.  
4.  
Heard. Record perused. 
5.  
Suit for recovery of maintenance was instituted by the 
“respondent” before the learned Judge Family Court, Chakwal, who 
proceeded to issue process against the petitioner. On account of non-
appearance, the petitioner was initially proceeded against ex-pare vide 
order dated 24th November, 2015 and finally suit was decreed as such by 
way of judgment dated 17th March, 2016. It is claim of the petitioner that 
he was not aware about the passing of the ex-parte decree and on attaining 
the knowledge, he immediately moved an application, which was well 
within time but it is dismissed being barred by time in an illegal and 
unlawful manner. 
6.  
For the expeditious settlement and disposal of disputes relating 
to the marriage and family affairs and for matters connected therewith, 
Family Courts were established under the Family Courts (Act XXXV of 
1964) (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1964”). Section 7 of the “Act, 
1964” prescribes the manner of institution of suits before the Family Court 
whereas section 8 deals with the procedure of intimation to defendant on 
presentation of plaint before the Family Court. Section 9 deals with the 
written statement and sub-section 5 of section 9 postulates that if the 
defendant fails to appear on the date fixed by the Family Court for his 
appearance, and it is proved that summons or notice was duly served on 
the defendant, the Family Court may proceed ex-parte. Since the suit was 
decreed ex-parte, so sub-sections 6 and 7 of section 9 of the “Act, 1964” 
would be quite relevant for the resolution of matter in issue, which are 
reproduced below for reference and convenience: -

9. (1)   Written statement.– …… 
 (2)  … …  
(3)  … … 
(4)  … … 
(5)  … …  
 (6)  In any case in which a decree is passed ex parte against a 
defendant under this Act, he may apply within thirty days of the service of 
notice under sub-section (7) of the passing of the decree to the Family 
Court by which the decree was passed for an order to set it aside, and if he 
satisfies the Family Court that he was not duly served, or that he was 
prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when the suit was heard 
or called for hearing, the Family Court shall, after service of notice on the 
plaintiff, and on such terms as to costs as it deems fit, make an order for 
setting aside the decree as against him, and shall appoint a day for 
proceeding with the suit; provided that where the decree is of such a 
nature that it cannot be set aside as against such defendant only, it may be 
set aside against all or any of the other defendants also. 
(7) The notice of passing of the ex-parte decree referred to in sub-
section (6) shall be sent to the defendant by the Family Court together 
with a certified copy of the decree within three days of the passing of the 
decree, through process server or by registered post, acknowledgement 
due, or through courier service or any other mode or manner as it may 
deem fit. 
(8)  … …  
 
 
 
 
(underlining supplied for emphasis) 
7.  
It is manifestly clear from the bare perusal of above referred 
provisions of law that in case a suit is decreed ex-parte, a defendant may 
apply within 30 days of the service of notice under sub-section 7 of section 
9 of the “Act, 1964” of the passing of the decree to the Family Court by 
which the decree was passed for an order to set it aside. Sub-section 7 of 
section 9 of the “Act, 1964” commands the Family Court to send a notice 
of passing of ex-parte decree to the defendant together with a certified 
copy of the decree within three days of the passing of such decree through 
process server or by registered post, acknowledgement due or through 
courier service or any other mode or manner as it may deem fit. 
Admittedly, due compliance to sub-section 7 was not made at all by the 
Family Court. 
8.  
So far contention of learned counsel for the “respondent” that 
this ground has not been taken in the petition, suffice to observe that 

4 
 
 
 
W.P.No.2998 of 2018 
 
 
 
sending of notice of passing of ex-parte decree in the manner provided in 
sub-section 7 of section 9 of the “Act, 1964” is the mandate of law. Nobody 
can be penalized on account of fault of the Court. Reference to this effect 
can be made to Syed AGHA HUSAIN SHAH and another v. Mst. DEENA 
BIBI and others (2017 CLC Note 69). 
9.  
It is an oft repeated principle that when law provides a specific 
manner for performing an act, then it should be performed in such manner 
but in no other way. Needless to mention that limitation of 30 days for 
filing an application for setting aside ex-parte decree would start from the 
service of notice under sub-section 7 as added by the Ordinance LV of 
2002. It would not be out of context to mention here that prior to insertion 
of sub-section 7, sub-section 6 ordained that in any case in which a decree 
is passed ex parte against a defendant under the Act, he may apply within 
reasonable time of the passing thereof to the Family Court by which the 
decree was passed for an order to set it aside. The word “reasonable time” 
was, however, substituted through the Amending Ordinance LV of 2002 
dated 1st October, 2002 as “30 days” of the service of notice under sub-
section 7 of the passing of the decree. In addition thereto, sub-sections 7 
and 8 were also added therein.  
10.  
Though Rule 13 of the Family Court Rules, 1965 postulates that 
an ex-parte decree or proceeding may for sufficient cause shown be set 
aside by the Court on application made to it within 30 days of the passing 
of the decree or decision but this rule is apparently showing scorn and 
derogative of the basic provision of “Act ,1964”. It is trite law that 
whenever there is an inconsistency between the rule and the basic 
provision of statute, the latter will prevail. Guidance in this respect can be 
sought 
from 
NATIONAL 
ELECTRIC 
POWER 
REGULATORY 
AUTHORITY versus FAISALABAD ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANY 
LIMITED (2016 SCMR 550). The relevant extract from the same is 
reproduced below: -

W.P.No.2998 of 2018 
 
 
 
“11. 
NEPRA Rules, 1998 are framed by the Authority under 
section 46 of the Act, 1997 with the approval of the Federal 
Government. Rules and or Regulations are the progeny or off spring of a 
Statute and are to be strictly in conformity with the provisions of the 
Statute where under same are framed. It is settled proposition of law 
that the rules framed under a Statute are to remain within the precinct of 
the Statute itself and cannot transgress the limits and parameters of the 
parent Statute itself. All efforts are to be made to interpret the rules so 
as to bring it in conformity and without injuring the intent and spirit of 
the Statute, where it is not possible then the rules in as much as it is 
injuring the very intent and spirit which must yield to the Statute. This 
view finds support from a case reported as Ziauddin v. Punjab Local 
Government (1985 SCMR 365 @ 368), wherein it was held as under:- 
 
 
"Rules framed under the statute could not go beyond and over 
reach the statute itself. To make implementation of statutory 
provision consistent harmonious directory effect must be given to 
requirement of Rule". 
12. 
In another case reported as Pakistan v. Aryan Petro 
Chemical Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. (2003 SCMR 370) in paragraph 11 of 
the judgment, it was held that "This is a settled principle that a statutory 
rule cannot enlarge the scope of the section under which it is framed 
and if a rule goes beyond what the section completes, the rule must yield 
to the statute. The authority of executive to make rules and regulations 
in order to effectuate the intention and policy of the Legislature, must be 
exercised within the limits of mandate given to the rule making authority 
and the rules framed under an enactment must be consistent with the 
provisions of said enactment. The rules framed under a statute if are 
inconsistent with the provisions of the statue and defeat the intention of 
Legislature expressed in the main statute, same shall be invalid". 
Reference to this effect can also be made to SUO MOTU CASE NO.13 OF 
2009 (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 619) and Civil Appeals Nos.2296 to 2412 
of 2001 “FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary, Ministry of 
Finance and others versus Haji MUHAMMAD SADIQ and others” (PLD 
2007 Supreme Court 133). 
11.  
The nutshell of above discussion is that the Courts below have 
committed patent illegality while dismissing the application for setting 
aside ex-parte decree, being barred by time. Resultantly this petition is 
allowed. The impugned judgment as well as order dated 30th July, 2018 
and 3rd February, 2018 are set aside being illegal and unlawful. As a 
sequel, the application for setting aside ex-parte decree shall be deemed to 
be pending before the learned Senior Civil Judge (Family Division),

Chakwal, who shall decide the same afresh on its own merits strictly in 
accordance with law. No order as to costs. 
12.  
Parties are directed to appear before the learned Senior Civil 
Judge (Family Division), Chakwal on 14.12.2023.
