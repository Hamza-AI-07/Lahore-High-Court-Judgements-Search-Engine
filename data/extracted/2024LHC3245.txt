MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This appeal under Section 24 of 
the Cantonments Rent Restriction Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to 
as “Act, 1963”) arises out of order dated 20th September, 2016, 
whereby the Additional Rent Controller, Chaklala Cantonment 
proceeded to dismiss the ejectment petition, filed by the appellants 
seeking eviction of the respondents. 
2.  
Facts in brief forming background of this appeal are that the 
appellants claiming themselves to be the landlords of house 
No.342/6, Rafi Road, Tariqabad, Rawalpindi (hereinafter referred to 
as “rented premises”) moved a petition under Section 17 of the “Act, 
1963” seeking eviction of the respondents on the grounds of personal 
bona-fide need, default in payment of rent and damage to the “rented 
premises”. The ejectment petition was resisted by the respondents, 
who submitted their reply, controverting not only rate of rent but the 
grounds of eviction agitated by the appellants. On receipt of reply 
from the respondents, the Additional Rent Controller, Chaklala 

F.A.O. No.49 of 2017 
 
-2- 
 
Cantonment proceeded to frame necessary issues to the following 
effect: 
1.  
What is the rate of rent? O.P.Parties 
2.  
Whether the suit property is required by the petitioners in 
good faith for their personal requirement? O.P.P. 
3.  
Whether the respondents are rent defaulters? O.P.P. 
4.  
Whether the respondents have damaged the suit property 
and have impaired its look, utility and have decreased its 
market value? O.P.P. 
5.  
Whether the ejectment petition is not maintainable in view 
of preliminary objections raised by the respondents? O.P.R. 
6.  
Relief. 
3. 
After framing of above referred issues, Additional Rent 
Controller proceeded to record evidence of both the sides and then 
dismissed the ejectment petition through impugned order. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the appellants contended that the 
appellants are the landlords of the “rented premises”, and have every 
right to get it vacated from the respondents on the grounds 
mentioned in the ejectment petition. Learned counsel submitted that 
though overwhelming evidence was produced by the appellants in 
support of the grounds of eviction but it has been discarded without 
assigning any lawful reasoning. Learned counsel argued with 
vehemence that the ejectment petition has been dismissed in an 
illegal and unlawful manner. 
5.  
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.1 submitted 
that the appellants badly failed to prove the grounds of eviction in 
the ejectment petition. It is argued with vehemence that the 
ejectment petition was rightly dismissed. Needless to mention here 
that though due intimation was conveyed to respondent No.2 but she 
did not turn up. 
6.  
Heard. Record perused. 
7.  
The appellants being the landlords of the rented premises 
moved a petition under Section 17 of the “Act, 1963” seeking 
eviction of the respondents on three-fold grounds. Firstly; that the 

F.A.O. No.49 of 2017 
 
-3- 
 
respondents have committed default in payment of rent w.e.f. 
January, 2013, secondly; “rented premises” are required by the 
appellants for their personal bona-fide need and thirdly; that the 
respondents have caused damage to the “rented premises”. It would 
not be out of context to mention here that the rate of rent was 
claimed by the appellants as Rs.6000/- per month, which was 
seriously controverted by the respondents, while submitting their 
written reply wherein they asserted that in fact the rate of rent was 
Rs.1,200/- per month, and they have already paid all the due rent. As 
already noted hereinabove that from the divergent pleadings of the 
parties, multiple issues were framed. It is noticed that the Additional 
Rent Controller in the first instance decided issue relating to the rate 
of rent and held that the rate of rent is Rs.1,200/- per month. I have 
examined the evidence produced by both the sides to this effect and 
found no material whatsoever to differ with the findings of the 
Additional Rent Controller to this effect. 
8.  
Issue No.2 relates to personal bona-fide need of the appellants. 
To this effect, appellant No.1 appeared as PW.1, however, during his 
cross examination he deposed as under:- 

F.A.O. No.49 of 2017 
 
-4- 
 
It is thus an admitted position on the record that previously, the 
appellants filed various ejectment petitions against their tenants on 
the same ground and obtained possession in terms of the eviction 
order. 
9. 
There is no cavil that it is prerogative of the landlord(s) to 
choose any of his/their property who in his/their estimation would 
meet his/their requirements but at the same time, ground of personal 
bona-fide need cannot be made basis for eviction of the tenant(s) 
when it is established on the record that the landlord(s) has/have 
already got vacated the other properties from his/their tenant(s) on 
the same ground in the near future. It is also established on the 
record that appellants have shifted their residence from Laal Kurti to 
Tulsa Chowk Lalazar just before filing of ejectment petition and they 
did not plead that the accommodation where they are residing is 
insufficient for their need. The appellants thus failed to prove that the 
“rented promises” is required for their personal bona-fide need.  
10.  
Adverting to the ground of default in payment of rent, it is 
noticed that to this effect, issue No.3 was framed by the Additional 
Rent Controller. While appearing as PW.1, the appellant No.1 
categorically asserted that the respondents have defaulted in payment 
of rent w.e.f. January, 2013. Though this assertion is refuted by the 
respondents in their reply but they have failed to discharge the onus. 
It is trite law that when the landlord(s) seek(s) eviction of his/their 
tenant(s) on the ground of default  in payment of rent, he/they 
has/have to only assert the factum of default supported by affidavit 
and the onus then would shift upon the tenant(s) to prove that 
he/they has/have not defaulted in payment of rent. It is noticed that 
in order to rebut the stance of the appellants, respondent No1 
appeared as R.W.1 as sole witness in support thereof. In addition rent 
receipt (Exhibit-P2) was made part of record. 
11. 
Adverting to the validity and authenticity of receipt of rent  
(Exhibit-P2) it is noticed that same was brought on record through 
the statement of counsel and it is heavily relied by the Additional 

F.A.O. No.49 of 2017 
 
-5- 
 
Rent Controller, while deciding the issue against the appellants. In 
the case of Mst. AKHTAR SULTANA versus Major Retd. MUZAFFAR KHAN 
MALIK through his legal heirs and others (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 715) the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan outlined the true import of the relevant 
provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 dealing with the 
relevancy and admissibility of the documentary evidence. The 
relevant extract from the same is reproduced below : - 
“(i) Relevant and admissible evidence  
10. The Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 ("Qanun-e-Shahadat") 
governs the law of evidence in our country. The expression 
"relevancy" and "admissibility" have their own distinct legal 
implications under the Qanun-e-Shahadat as, more often than 
not, facts which are relevant may not be admissible. On the one 
hand, a fact is "relevant" if it is logically probative or 
disprobative of the fact-in-issue, which requires proof. On the 
other hand, a fact is "admissible" if it is relevant and not 
excluded by any exclusionary provision, express or implied. 
What is to be understood is that unlike "relevance", which is 
factual and determined solely by reference to the logical 
relationship between the fact claimed to be relevant and the 
fact-in-issue, "admissibility" is a matter of law. Thus, a 
"relevant" fact would be "admissible" unless it is excluded 
from being admitted, or is required to be proved in a particular 
mode(s) before it can be admitted as evidence, by the 
provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat. As far as the latter is 
concerned, and that too relating to documents, admissibility is 
of two types: (i) admissible subject to proof, and (ii) admissible 
per se, that is, when the document is admitted in evidence 
without requiring proof. 
(ii) Mode of proof  
11. Mode of proof is the procedure by which the "relevant" and 
"admissible" facts have to be proved, the manner whereof has 
been prescribed in Articles 70-89 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat. In 
other words, a "relevant" and "admissible" fact is admitted as a 
piece of evidence, only when the same has been proved by the 
party asserting the same. In this regard, the foundational 
principle governing proof of contents of documents is that the 
same are to be proved by producing "primary evidence" or 
"secondary evidence". The latter is only permissible in certain 
prescribed circumstances, which have been expressly provided 
in the Qanun-e-Shahadat.  
12. What is important to note is that, as a general principle, an 
objection as to inadmissibility of a document can be raised at 
any stage of the case, even if it had not been taken when the 
document was tendered in evidence. However, the objection as 
to the mode of proving contents of a document or its execution 
is to be taken, when a particular mode is adopted by the party 
at the evidence-recording stage during trial. The latter kind of  
objection cannot be allowed to be raised, for the first time, at 
any subsequent stage. This principle is based on the rule of fair 
play. As if the objection regarding the mode of proof adopted 
has been taken at the appropriate stage, it would have enabled 
the party tendering the evidence to cure the defect and resort to 
other mode of proof. The omission to object at the appropriate 
stage becomes fatal because, by his failure, the party entitled to 

F.A.O. No.49 of 2017 
 
-6- 
 
object allows the party tendering the evidence to act on 
assumption that he has no objection about the mode of proof 
adopted. 
13. It is also important to note that the objection as to "mode of 
proof" should not be confused with the objection of "absence 
of proof". Absence of proof goes to the very root of 
admissibility of the document as a piece of evidence; therefore, 
this objection can be raised at any stage, as the first proviso to 
Article 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat commands that "the 
judgment must be based upon facts declared by this Order to be 
relevant, and duly proved". In other words, when the Qanun-e-
Shahadat provides several modes of proving a relevant fact and 
a party adopts a particular mode that is permissible only in 
certain circumstances, the failure to take objection when that 
mode is adopted, estops the opposing party to raise, at a 
subsequent stage, the objection to the mode of proof adopted. 
However, when the Qanun-e-Shahadat provides only one mode 
of proving a relevant fact and that mode is not adopted, or 
when it provides several modes of proving a relevant fact and 
none of them is adopted, such a case falls within the purview of 
"absence of proof", and not "mode of proof"; therefore, the 
objection thereto can be taken at any stage, even if it has not 
earlier been taken. 
(iii) Evidentiary value  
14. Once a fact crosses the threshold of "relevancy", 
"admissibility" and "proof", as mandated under the provisions 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, would it be said to be admitted, for 
its evidentiary value to be adjudged by the trial court. The 
evidentiary value or in other words, weight of evidence, is 
actually a qualitative assessment made by the trial judge of the 
probative value of the proved fact. Unlike "admissibility", the 
evidentiary value of a piece of evidence cannot be determined 
by fixed rules, since it depends mainly on common sense, logic 
and experience and is determined by the trial judge, keeping in 
view the peculiarities of each case.” 
12. 
To the above effect guidance can also be sought from 
MANZOOR HUSSAIN (deceased) through L.Rs. versus MISRI KHAN (PLD 
2020 Supreme Court 749) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held 
as under :- 
“4. 
Before parting with this case we would like to 
comment 
on 
a 
related 
matter. 
Copies 
of 
the 
acknowledgement receipt (exhibit P4), aks shajarah kishtwar 
(exhibit P2), registered post receipt (exhibit P3), mutation 
(exhibit P5) and jamabandi for the year 2000-2001 (exhibit 
P6) were produced and exhibited by the pre-emptor's 
counsel, but without him testifying. We have noted that 
copies of documents, having no concern with counsel, are 
often tendered in evidence through a simple statement of 
counsel but without administering an oath to him and 
without him testifying, especially in the province of Punjab. 
Ordinarily, documents are produced through a witness who 
testifies on oath and who may be cross-examined by the 
other side. However, there are exceptions with regard to 
facts which need not be proved; these are those which the 
Court will take judicial notice of under Article 111 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and are mentioned in Article 

F.A.O. No.49 of 2017 
 
-7- 
 
112, and facts which are admitted (Article 113, Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984). 
5. 
The acknowledgement receipt was stated to have 
been signed when the envelope said to contain the Talb-i-
Ishhad notice was purportedly received by the respondent. 
However, the respondent had not admitted receipt of the said 
notice, therefore, the acknowledgement receipt (exhibit P4) 
could not be stated to be an admitted document and did not 
constitute an admitted fact. Therefore, delivery to and/or 
receipt by the respondent of the notice had to be established. 
We also note that in this case the said counsel had furnished 
copies of all five documents (exhibits P2 to P6), which were 
produced by him. The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
explicitly sets out the documents which must be produced in 
original, which in the present case would be the registered 
post receipt (exhibit P3) and acknowledgment receipt 
(exhibit P4), and photo copies, that is secondary evidence, 
could only be produced as permitted; and as regards extracts 
of official records, that is, the aks shajarah kishtwar (exhibit 
P2), mutation (exhibit P5) and jamabandi (exhibit P6), 
certified copies thereof had to be tendered in evidence. In 
not 
observing 
the 
rules 
of 
evidence 
unnecessary 
complications for litigants are created, which may result in 
avoidable adverse orders or in the case being remanded on 
such score, which would be avoided by abiding by the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.” 
The above principles were even reiterated by this Court in the case of 
NATIONAL COMMAND AUTHORITY through D.G. SPD, Rawalpindi and 
others versus ZAHOOR AZAM and others (2024 CLC 1).  
13. 
Though rigors of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 cannot be 
pressed into service with full force in the proceedings before the 
Rent Controller but cardinal principles regulating the procedure for 
recording of evidence cannot be kept aside totally. 
14. 
The Additional Rent Controller founded his conclusion 
exclusively relying upon rent receipt (Exhibit-P2) which was not 
admissible at all and was only an anecdotal piece of evidence.  
15. 
From the discussion made hereinabove, I am of the considered 
view that the appellants remained successful in proving that the 
respondents committed default in payment of rent. It is an oft 
repeated principle of law that if the landlord(s) plead(s) multiple 
grounds for eviction of the tenant(s) and if he/they fail(s) to prove 
one or more of such ground, the eviction order can be rested on any 
one of the recognized grounds which the landlord(s) ultimately 
succeeded to establish.

-8- 
 
16. 
For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is allowed and while 
setting aside the impugned order dated 20th September, 2016 the 
ejectment petition is accepted. The respondents are directed to hand 
over the vacant possession of the “rented premises” to the appellants 
within thirty (30) days from today with no order as to costs. Record 
of the Additional Rent Controller, Chaklala Cantonment be remitted 
back.
