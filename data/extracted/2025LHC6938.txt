Cr. Appeal No.38037 of 2022 
 
 
Whereas co-accused, Shabbir Hussain, was acquitted of the charge by 
the learned trial Court vide the same judgment.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case as narrated by Ameer Ahmad, 
complainant in complaint (Ex-PU) are that he was a resident of Arif 
Wala, District Pakpattan and his son, Muhammad Ramzan, who was a 
civil engineer in Naveed Construction Company, Gujrat situated at 
Jalalpur Jattan road in front of Zarai-Tarakyati Bank, was un-traceable 
since 21.06.2019 from 05:30 p.m. He having suspicion about 
abduction of his son, who was in possession of Rs.50,000/- alongwith 
a motor cycle GTM-2974 Honda 70 CC, lodged the case. Initially, the 
case was registered u/s 365 PPC, however, during course of 
investigation, a supplementary statement of the complainant was got 
recorded wherein he disclosed that his son was murdered by accused 
persons, Sumaira Bibi (appellant) alongwith her co-accused, Shabbir 
Hussain (since acquitted) and subsequently, offences u/s 302/201/34 
PPC were added and on culmination of the same, report u/s 173 
Cr.P.C. was submitted before the learned trial Court while declaring 
them as guilty, they were summoned, charge was framed which was 
denied by them, hence, trial commenced. The prosecution in order to 
prove its case produced as many as fifteen PWs. Last seen evidence in 
this case was produced by Muhammad Babar (PW-8), whereas 
complainant Ameer Ahmad himself appeared as PW-9. Medical 
evidence was furnished by Dr. Waqas Ali, who conducted autopsy on 
the dead body of the deceased and investigation of the case was 
carried out by Irshad Ahmad SI/SHO (PW-13) and Asad Ishaq DSP 
(PW-15). The remaining witnesses were of formal in nature and the 
prosecution after producing certain documents closed its evidence. 
After completion of prosecution evidence, statement of the appellant 
was recorded u/s 342 Cr.P.C., in which she denied the allegation 
leveled against her. She did not opt to appear as her own witness u/s 
340 (2) Cr.P.C., however, produced certain documents in her defence. 
After evaluating prosecution evidence available on record, learned 
trial Court found the prosecution version correct ‘beyond any shadow 

 
 
3 
Cr. Appeal No.38037 of 2022 
 
 
of doubt’ to the extent of the appellant, which resulted into her 
conviction and sentence in the afore stated terms. 
3. 
In support of the instant appeal, learned counsel for the 
appellant contends that case of the prosecution is inherently flawed, 
hence, fails to inspire confidence; that this was an unseen occurrence 
and the whole case of the prosecution was based on the evidence of 
last seen furnished by Muhammad Babar (PW-8), which is not 
trustworthy and reliable according to the facts of the case, he has 
failed to show his presence at the place where he had lastly seen the 
appellant and her co-accused, hence, no implicit reliance can be made 
on his testimony to maintain the conviction and sentence of the 
appellant; that nothing incriminating was recovered from possession 
of the appellant and if anything shown, it was planted one; that the 
impugned judgment is based on surmises and conjectures as material 
evidence available on record in favour of the appellant has been mis-
read by the prosecution; that medical evidence is also not in line with 
the ocular account; that motive set up by the prosecution has also not 
been proved and lastly prays that since the prosecution has miserably 
failed to prove its case against the appellant up to hilt, hence, by 
accepting the instant appeal, she be acquitted of the charge.  
4. 
Conversely, learned Deputy Prosecutor General has faithfully 
defended the impugned judgment by controverting the arguments of 
learned counsel for the appellant and has contended that the 
prosecution has ably proved its case against the appellant “beyond 
reasonable shadow of doubt”; that to substantiate the case of the 
prosecution apart from last seen evidence, the prosecution has 
adduced medical evidence, recovery of dead body from the house of 
the appellant, evidence of motive which has also been believed by 
learned trial Court, so, all the evidence produced by the prosecution 
fully corroborates the last seen evidence produced by Muhammad 
Babar (PW-8), so, in presence of voluminous evidence, the appellant 
does not deserve any leniency and she has rightly been adjudged 

 
 
4 
Cr. Appeal No.38037 of 2022 
 
 
guilty by the learned trial Court, hence, the instant appeal is liable to 
be dismissed.     
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the appellant, learned Law 
Officer and perused the record with their assistance. 
6. 
Undoubtedly, no direct evidence qua murder of, Muhammad 
Ramzan s/o complainant, Ameer Ahmad, was available in this case, 
rather to bring home guilt of the appellant, the prosecution had relied 
upon the evidence of, Muhammad Babar (PW-8), who alongwith 
Nawaz (not produced), had lastly seen, Muhammad Ramzan 
(deceased), in the company of appellant Sumaira Bibi and co-accused 
Shabbir Hussain (since acquitted), who allegedly called upon him 
from Lala G Hotal, Gujrat, on 21.06.2019 at 05:00 p.m., when former 
were sitting alongwith him, and evidence of recovery of dead body of 
the deceased from house of the appellant. Ameer Ahmad (PW-9) 
complainant/father of the deceased, while reporting the incident to the 
police on 21.06.2019 at 11:00 a.m. stated that he originally hails from 
District Pakpattan, his son, Muhammad Ramzan, was an engineer in 
Naveed Construction Company, Gujrat, who used to reside at Jalalpur 
Jattan Road, in front of Zaritrakyati Bank. The other employees of 
construction company informed him that his son, Muhammad 
Ramzan, was missing and his mobile phone was also switched off. On 
his application (Ex-PU), formal FIR (Ex-PA) was drafted by the 
police under section 365 PPC (Kidnapping or abducting), however, 
offences u/s 302/201/34 PPC were added on 24.06.2019. The 
complainant (PW-9) made another statement (supplementary 
statement) to the police on 24.06.2019, to the effect that two persons, 
Muhammad Nawaz (not produced) and Muhammad Babar (PW-8), 
apprised him that on 21.06.2019 at evening time, when they were 
sitting in Lala G Hotal, Service Mor, Gujrat and having tea, two 
persons, Sumaira Bibi (appellant) and Shabbir Hussain (since 
acquitted) arrived there on motor cycle. They called upon Muhammad 
Ramzan, who left with them while riding on his motorcycle GTM-

 
 
5 
Cr. Appeal No.38037 of 2022 
 
 
7974 Honda 70. Appellant Sumaira Bibi, was arrested on 22.06.2019, 
she led the police party to her house, situated at Street No.1 Akhtar 
Shah Colony, Gujrat, on 25.06.2019, pointed out place where she 
alongwith her co-accused, Shabbir Hussain, had got buried dead body 
of Muhammad Ramzan, after killing him. The police after digging 
earth from a room of the said house got recovered the dead body, 
which was identified by Ameer Ahmad (PW-9) complainant/father of 
the deceased and Muhammad Babar (PW-8). The dead body was 
taken into possession by the police vide recovery memo (Ex-PF) and 
got conducted postmortem on 26.06.2019 by Dr. Waqas Ali ABS 
Teaching Hospital, Gujrat (PW-7).  
7. 
Meaning thereby that the prosecution is basically relying upon 
two pieces of evidence, one last seen evidence provided by 
Muhammad Babar (PW-8) and Muhammad Nawaz (not produced), 
coupled with the recovery of dead body at the instance of the 
appellant from her house. There is no denial of the fact that last seen 
evidence itself is not considered sufficient for establishing the guilt 
but if, the chain of the facts is such that no reasonable inference can 
be drawn except that the accused had committed the offence, after the 
victim has been last seen in his company then in absence of 
reasonable explanation from the accused, such evidence can be relied 
upon. In case of “KHURSHID v. THE STATE” (PLD 1996 SC 305), 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan had held that deceased was last 
seen with the accused persons is a reliable piece of circumstantial 
evidence if corroborated by other piece of circumstantial evidence 
which are interlinked and which clearly connect the accused persons 
with the commission of the offence charged with. I am mindful of the 
fact that under Article 40 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
(QSO), the evidence qua recovery of dead body at the instance of the 
accused, is permissible evidence, which article reads as under;- 
 
“40. How much of information received from accused 
may be proved. When any fact is deposed to as 

 
 
6 
Cr. Appeal No.38037 of 2022 
 
 
discovered in consequence of information received from 
a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a 
police-officer, so much of such information, whether it 
amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the 
fact thereby discovered, may be proved.”           
On going through the above provision of law, one thing is very 
obvious that information received from the accused is admissible and 
can be used against him, if something incriminating is recovered in 
pursuance of his information. To be admissible and used against the 
accused, the recovery must be based on a statement made by the 
accused, while in police custody and this statement must lead to the 
discovery of a fact not previously known to the police. If the accused 
has exclusive knowledge of the body’s location, the recovery is 
considered as strong piece of circumstantial evidence. On going 
through recovery memo (Ex-PF), it reveals that it was the present 
appellant, Sumaira Bibi, who while confessing her guilt disclosed to 
the police that she can get recovered the dead body of Muhammad 
Ramzan (deceased) from her house and obviously, it was in her 
exclusive knowledge and was not previously known to the police. 
Although, first part of her statement where she allegedly confessed 
her guilt is not a permissible piece of evidence but according to above 
referred Article 40 of (QSO), when something is recovered in 
consequence of information provided by the appellant on the basis of 
which, dead body of the deceased was recovered, this is a valid piece 
of evidence and could be used to advance the prosecution’s case and 
to meet the ends of justice.  
8. 
The fundamental principle of universal application in cases 
dependent on circumstantial evidence is that in order to justify the 
inference of guilt, the incriminating fact must be incompatible with 
the innocence of the accused or the guilt of any other person and 
incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than 
that of his guilt. Reliance may be placed on the cases of “Sher Mohd. 
V. Emperor” A.I.R.(32) 1945 Lahore 27, “ZAHID HUSSAIN v. The 
CROWN” (PLD 1954 Lahore 710), “ABDUS SAMAD v. The 

 
 
7 
Cr. Appeal No.38037 of 2022 
 
 
STATE”(PLD 1964 SC 167), “MD. NAZIR HOSSAIN SARKAR and 
another v. The STATE” (1969 SCMR 388), “MD. NAZIR HOSSAIN 
SARKAR and another v. The STATE” (1969 P Cr. L J 956) and “Mst. 
SAIRAN alias SALEEMA v. The STATE” (PLD 1970 SC 56). In case 
of “ABDUS SAMAD v. The STATE” referred above, while relying on 
the principle laid down by the Federal Court in case of “Fazal Elahi v. 
The Crown” (PLD 1953 FC 214), the Apex Court had held that the 
deceased child was last seen in company of accused. The accused 
having exclusive knowledge of place where remains of child were 
found is sufficient to establish charges of kidnapping and murder. In 
another celebrated judgment of this Court, passed in case of 
“GHULAM MUHAMMAD v. The STATE” (1982 P Cr. L J 1217), last 
seen evidence coupled with recovery of dead body at instance of 
accused held sufficient basis, for holding accused guilty of murder 
and death sentence awarded to the accused in that case was confirmed. 
9. 
While keeping the above said criteria in mind, I am of the view 
that in the case in hand, two prosecution witnesses had seen the 
appellant and acquitted co-accused, Shabbir Hussain, when 
Muhammad Ramzan (deceased) had left with them from Lala G 
Hotal, Gujrat, on 21.06.2019 at evening time, the case qua his missing 
was registered on 23.06.2019, on the statement of his father Ameer 
Ahmad (PW-9) and on the very next day i.e. 24.06.2019, the appellant 
was implicated in this case and on 25.06.2019, she got recovered the 
dead body from her house that is also situated in Gujrat city. Meaning 
thereby that last seen evidence also qualifies, the test of not only the 
proximity of time but also of the distance/space, therefore, there is no 
occasion to discard the same on any hypothesis and the last seen 
evidence, is sufficiently corroborated by the recovery of dead body at 
the instance of the appellant, which itself carries a huge evidentiary 
value and is a strong piece of evidence to prove the guilt of the 
appellant.  

 
 
8 
Cr. Appeal No.38037 of 2022 
 
 
10. 
The epitome of the above discussion is that the above said 
pieces of evidence are sufficient to bring home the guilt of the 
appellant, even otherwise, I have gone through the observations and 
findings so made by learned trial Court, which appear to be 
convincing and reasonable in view of the facts and circumstances of 
the case, therefore, the arguments so raised by learned counsel for the 
appellant, being devoid of force are repelled accordingly and 
convictions and sentences awarded to the appellant by the learned trial 
Court through the impugned judgment are sustained. Resultantly, the 
appeal filed by her is dismissed. However, both sentences shall run 
concurrently and benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C as awarded by the 
learned trial Court will remain intact.
