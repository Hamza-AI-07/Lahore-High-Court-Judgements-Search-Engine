Petitioners by: 
Mr. Hyder Ali Khan, Advocate. 
Respondents by: 
Ch. Zulfiqar Ali, Advocate for respondent 
No.1.  
 
Mr. Ghulam Farid Sanotra, Advocate for

i.e. C.R. No.222680 of 2018).  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.:- This 
consolidated judgment shall dispose of instant revision petition along 
with following connected petition as common questions of law and 
facts are involved in these cases:-  
C.R. No.222680 of 2018 titled Muhammad Iqbal v. Shahab-
ud-Din & others 
2. 
These revision petitions are directed against judgment & decree 
dated 21.05.2018, passed by learned Additional District Judge, Lahore, 
whereby respondent No.1’s appeal against Trial Court’s judgment & 
decree dated 21.11.2015 dismissing respondent No.1’s suit for 
possession through specific performance of agreement to sell, was 
allowed and aforesaid suit was decreed.  
3. 
Necessary facts of the case are that respondent No.1 filed suit for 
possession through specific performance of agreement to sell dated 
02.04.2005 along with permanent injunction, which was contested by 
petitioner Mst. Qamar Bibi (since deceased) as well as respondent 
No.2 Muhammad Iqbal by way of filing their respective written 
statements. Trial Court, after framing issues, recording evidence and 
hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties, proceeded to 
dismiss the suit to the extent of specific performance of agreement to 

 
2 
C.R. No.233690 of 2018 & connected case 
 
sell, whereas decreed it to the extent that respondent No.1 was held 
entitled to recover earnest money of Rs.700,000/- from petitioner. In 
appeal filed by respondent No.1, learned Additional District Judge, 
vide judgment & decree dated 21.05.2018, set aside Trial Court’s 
decision dated 21.11.2015 and decreed respondent No.1’s suit for 
possession and specific performance of agreement to sell with 
permanent injunction in the manner that he was held entitled to get 
vacant possession of the suit property and transaction taken place 
during pendency of suit in favour of respondent No.2 Muhammad 
Iqbal vide registered sale deed No.3774 dated 19.05.2008 was declared 
ineffective, respondent No.1 was directed to pay the balance sale 
consideration i.e. Rs.13,83,125/- within 30 days before Trial Court, in 
cash to be paid to petitioner, otherwise, appeal would be deemed to 
have been dismissed. Hence, these revision petitions.  
4. 
Learned counsel for petitioner Muhammad Iqbal (respondent 
No.2 herein) submits that while decreeing the suit, the Appellate Court 
has misconstrued the contents of application under Order IX Rule 6 
read with Section 151 CPC, filed by Mst. Qamar Bibi in suit for 
permanent injunction filed by respondent No.1, wherein she admitted 
execution of agreement to sell dated 02.04.2005, payment of earnest 
money of Rs.700,000/- and shown her readiness to execute sale deed 
upon payment of remaining consideration amount. He further submits 
that actually respondent No.1 never responded and showed his 
willingness to pay balance sale consideration inasmuch as aforesaid 
statement / ground could not have been relied upon to decree a 
subsequent suit, which ought to have been decided on its own merits. 
He adds that suit in hand was based upon mala fide intention, in order 
to prolong the litigation as such demonstrating zero readiness to make 
the balance payment for the purpose of getting sale deed registered. He 
contends that grant of decree of specific performance of agreement to 
sell is a discretionary relief, which can be withheld even if the 
execution of agreement to sell is proved. He argues that the Appellate 
Court must give reasons to differ with the findings of Trial Court, 
whereas, in the instant case, the Appellate court has failed to adhere to 
the provisions of Order XLI Rule 31 CPC and has not given issue-wise 

 
3 
C.R. No.233690 of 2018 & connected case 
 
findings. In support, he has referred to Jamil Akhtar and others v. Las 
Baba and others (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 494), Province of the 
Punjab through Collector District Khushab, Jauharabad and others v. 
Haji Yaqoob Khan and others (2007 SCMR 554), Pakistan Refinery 
Ltd., Karachi v. Barrett Hodgson Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. and others (2019 
SCMR 1726), Minhaj-ul-Islam Sabri through General Attorney v. 
Mrs. Soofia Munir and 7 others (2006 CLC 1352), Mst. Sikandar 
Jahan and 4 others v. Mst. Ghulam Zainab and 10 others (2013 CLC 
228) and Syed Ayoob Ali Shah v. Mst. Rabia Begum (2013 CLC 419). 
Learned counsel for petitioners in this case has adopted the above 
arguments.  
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.1 defends the 
impugned appellate judgment & decree by contending that respondent 
No.1 is bona fide purchaser of the suit property, who performed his 
part of the agreement, whereas it was petitioner Mst. Qamar Bibi (since 
deceased) who failed to do the needful and acted mala fidely by not 
receiving the remaining sale consideration. He maintains that when 
Mst. Qamar Bibi herself admitted in previous suit filed by respondent 
No.1 to execute sale deed after receiving the balance sale 
consideration, thus, the Trial Court should have decreed the suit in 
terms of Order XII Rule 6 CPC and Articles 81 and 113 of the 
Qanbun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 instead of rejecting the plaint under 
Order VII Rule 11 CPC. He submits that the Appellate Court is not 
bound to render issue-wise findings in each and every case. In support, 
he referred to Abdul Karim v. Haji Noor Badshah (2012 SCMR 212), 
Mst. Sardar Begum & 5 others v. Muhammad Ilyas and another [PLJ 
2013 SC (AJ&K) 340 (DB)], Miran Bakhsh through L.Rs. and 6 
others v. Ali Muhammad (2013 MLD 142), Muhammad Bakhash and 2 
others v. Inayat Bi and 13 others (2021 YLR 1562) and Iftikhar Ali 
and others v. Riaz-ul-Haq alias Riaz Ahmed and others (2023 YLR 
854).  
6. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
7. 
Admittedly, parties entered into agreement to sell dated 
02.04.2005, earnest money of Rs.700,000/- was paid to Mst. Qamar 
Bibi (since deceased), the target date to finalize the transaction was 

 
4 
C.R. No.233690 of 2018 & connected case 
 
01.06.2005 and suit for specific performance of the agreement to sell 
was filed on 03.03.2007. The main stance of petitioners is that 
respondent No.1 could not arrange the remaining sale consideration 
within target date and also did not show his readiness to pay at any 
subsequent stage whereas the version of respondent No.1 is that Mst. 
Qamar Bibi (since deceased) was not willing to deliver possession of 
suit property and receive the sale consideration and lapse was on her 
part to perform her part of obligation. Record shows that earlier 
respondent No.1 filed suit for permanent injunction to restrain Mst. 
Qamar Bibi (since deceased) to further alienate the suit property, plaint 
whereof was rejected vide order dated 28.02.2007 with the observation 
that the said suit was not maintainable on the basis of agreement to sell 
as the proper form was to file suit for specific performance of 
agreement to sell. The moot point for determination by this Court is 
whether respondent No.1 expressed his willingness and readiness to 
pay the remaining sale consideration or the lapse was on the part of 
Mst. Qamar Bibi (since deceased). 
8. 
The Appellate Court has mainly relied upon the contents of 
application under Order IX Rule 6 read with Section 151 CPC, moved 
by Mst. Qamar Bibi (since deceased) seeking setting aside of ex parte 
proceedings, to decree the suit wherein she offered and showed her 
readiness to execute registered sale deed subject to deposit of 
remaining sale consideration. Admittedly, said offer was not responded 
positively by respondent No.1 and owing to this lapse and previous 
conduct as highlighted in preceding paragraphs, the suit could not have 
been decreed in his favour. Learned Trial Court, after thoroughly 
examining the evidence adduced by the parties has also noted that 
respondent No.1 has failed to prove that he contacted Mst. Qamar Bibi/ 
defendant for transfer of the suit property and she refused to perform 
her part of the obligation. The relevant observations are reproduced as 
under:- 
“9…. Regarding the remaining amount there is nothing on record 
which could suggest that the plaintiff was ready to pay the remaining 
amount and when the plaintiff is at fault or not paying the remaining 
consideration amount then the defendant is at liberty to sell the said 
suit property to anybody else. Furthermore, in his whole evidence he 

 
5 
C.R. No.233690 of 2018 & connected case 
 
has failed to prove that he has contacted with the defendant for the 
transfer of the suit property and the defendant No.1 was at default 
for non transferring the suit property. On the other hand from the 
whole available evidence it is clear that the plaintiff is at default of 
non payment of the remaining consideration amount, so under these 
circumstances as well as the case law submitted by the defendant, 
the plaintiff is not entitled for the relief of specific performance of 
contract…..” 
 
9. 
It is evident that respondent No.1 did not opt to deposit the 
balance amount in the Court, which may help the Court to establish 
that he was not at fault. The available record also does not show that 
respondent No.1 ever made any positive attempt to pay the balance 
sale consideration to Mst. Qamar Bibi (since deceased) and she 
refused to accept the same. It is now well-settled that even where the 
vendor refuses to accept the sale consideration amount, the vendee 
seeking a specific performance of the agreement to sell is essentially 
required to deposit the amount in the Court, which demonstrates his / 
her capability, readiness and willingness to perform the obligation, 
which elements are missing in the instant case. Failure on the part of 
respondent No.1 to meet the said essential requirement disentitles him 
to the relief of specific performance. In these circumstances, there was 
no justification left with the Appellate Court to decree the suit and 
permit respondent No.1 to tender the balance sale consideration after a 
lapse of about 13-years. Reference can be made to Messrs Kuwait 
National Real Estate Company (Pvt.) Ltd. and others v. Messrs 
Educational Excellence Ltd. and another (2020 SCMR 171), 
Muhammad Yousaf v. Allah Ditta and others (2021 SCMR 1241) 
and Masood Ahmad Bhatti and another v. Khan Badshah and another 
(2024 SCMR 168).  
10. 
Section 24 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 details the 
contracts which cannot be specifically enforced and section 24(b) 
provides that specific performance of a contract cannot be enforced 
in favour of a person who has become incapable of performing, or 
violates, any essential term of the contract that on his part remains to 
be performed. Respondent No.1 has failed to prove his readiness to 
perform his part of obligation through any supporting evidence. 
Likewise, as per Section 54 of the Contract Act, 1908 when a 

 
6 
C.R. No.233690 of 2018 & connected case 
 
contract consists of reciprocal promises, then second promise cannot 
be insisted to be done nor failure thereof can be claimed for damages 
or as a ground to fail the agreement unless it is established that the 
first promise was done. In this case, time was essence of the contract, 
the consequence was to be in accordance with the agreement but the 
Appellate Court has ignored this fact and further when fault was with 
the vendee-plaintiff he was absolutely not entitled for the discretionary 
relief in the shape of a decree for specific performance. Reliance is 
placed upon Muhammad Asif Awan v. Dawood Khan and others 
(2021 SCMR 1270), Muhammad Aslam and others v. Muhammad 
Anwar (2023 SCMR 1371) and Muhammad Ramzan v. Muhammad 
Ali and 13 others (2016 MLD 1255). 
11. 
Needless to say that there is no provision in the Specific Relief 
Act, 1877, which casts any duty on the Court or requires the vendee 
to first deposit the balance sale consideration upon filing of the suit 
seeking specific performance of an agreement in respect of an 
immovable property. However, the relief of specific performance is 
discretionary and based on the principles of equity, thus, cannot be 
claimed as a matter of right. Therefore, the Court in order to ensure 
the bona fide of the vendee at any stage of the proceedings may put 
him to terms. Furthermore, such plaintiff is not only supposed to 
narrate in the plaint his readiness and willingness to fulfill his part of 
the agreement but also is bound to demonstrate through supporting 
evidence such as pay orders, Bank statement or other material, his 
ability to fulfill his part of the deal leaving no doubt in the mind of 
the Court that the proceedings seeking specific performances have 
been initiated to cover up his default or to gain time to generate 
resources or create ability to fulfill his part of the deal. It was, for 
this reason, mandatory for the plaintiff to prove that at the relevant 
time he had sufficient money to pay the remaining sale price. 
Another rationale behind is that invariably the value of money 
depreciates over time and that of land appreciates. Courts 
adjudicating such cases should not be unmindful of this reality and 
should endeavor to secure the interest of both parties. In a suit for 
specific performance of land, if the seller / vendor has refused to 

 
7 
C.R. No.233690 of 2018 & connected case 
 
receive the sale consideration, or any part thereof, it should be 
deposited in Court and invested in some government protected 
security (such as Defence or National Savings Certificates); in case 
the suit is decreed the seller would receive the value of money which 
prevailed at the time of the contract and in case the buyer loses he 
can similarly retrieve the deposited amount. Reliance is placed upon 
Mst. Samina Riffat and others v. Rohail Asghar and others ( 2021 
SCMR 7), Muhammad Jamil and others  v.  Muhammad Arif (2021 
SCMR 1108) and Mst. Rehmat and others v. Mst. Zubaida Begum 
and others (2021 SCMR 1534). 
12. 
Undoubtedly, execution of agreement to sell is admitted in the 
instant case and perhaps compliance of Article 17(2) read with 
Article 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984 is not required on the 
ground that admitted facts need not to be proved, however the 
observation of the Appellate Court that scribe could replace the 
requirements of producing other marginal witness is legally 
defective and hardly sustainable as for the grant of a decree plaintiff, 
inter-alia, has to prove the agreement to sell by producing two 
marginal witnesses. It is settled law that an agreement to sell an 
immovable property squarely falls within the purview of the provisions 
of Article 17(2) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and has to be 
compulsorily attested by the two witnesses and this is sine qua non for 
the validity of the agreement. For the purposes of proof of such 
agreement involving financial obligation it is mandatory that two 
attesting witnesses must be examined by the party to the lis as per 
Article 79 of the Order ibid. Article 79 is reproduced hereunder for 
ease of reference:- 
"If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not be used 
as evidence until two attesting witnesses at least have been called 
for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be two attesting 
witnesses alive and subject to the process of the Court and capable 
of giving evidence." 
            This Article in clear and unambiguous words provides that a 
document required to be attested shall not be used as evidence unless 
two attesting witnesses at least have been called for the purpose of 
proving its execution. The words "shall not be used as evidence" 

 
8 
C.R. No.233690 of 2018 & connected case 
 
unmistakably show that such document shall be proved in such and no 
other manner. The words "two attesting witnesses at least" further 
show that calling two attesting witnesses for the purpose of proving its 
execution is a bare minimum. Nothing short of two attesting witnesses 
if alive and capable of giving evidence can even be imagined for 
proving its execution. Construing the requirement of the Article as 
being procedural rather than substantive and equating the testimony of 
a Scribe with that of an attesting witness would not only defeat the 
letter and spirit of the Article but reduce the whole exercise of re-
enacting it to a farce. Therefore, a scribe of a document can only be a 
competent witness if he has fixed his signature as an attesting witness 
of the document and not otherwise; his signing the document in the 
capacity of a writer does not fulfil and meet the mandatory requirement 
of attestation by him separately, however, he may be examined by the 
concerned party for the corroboration of the evidence of the marginal 
witnesses, or in the eventuality those are conceived by Article 79 itself 
not as a substitute. The purpose and object of the attestation of a 
document by a certain number of witnesses and its proof through them 
is also meant to eliminate the possibility of fraud and purported attempt 
to create and fabricate false evidence for the proof thereof and for this 
the legislature in its wisdom has established a class of documents 
which are specified, inter alia, in Article 17 of the Order, 1984. 
Reliance is placed upon Rafaqat Ali v. Muhammad Farid and others 
(2007 SCMR 1083), Hafiz Tassaduq Hussain v.  Muhammad Din 
through Legal Heirs and others (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 241), 
Farzand Ali and another v. Khuda Bakhsh and others (PLD 2015 
Supreme Court 187), Farid Bakhsh v. Jind Wadda and others (2015 
SCMR 1044), Sheikh Muhammad Muneer v. Mst. Feezan (PLD 
2021 Supreme Court 538) and Muhammad Ghaffar (Deceased) 
through LRs and others v. Arif Muhammad (2023 SCMR 344). 
13. 
It is notable that the Appellate Court did not bother to give any 
findings on the issues distinctly and further did not seem to have 
examined every aspect of the lis for recording its reasons to justify 
reversal of the adjudication made by the lower court. Moreover proper 
points of determination were also apparently not framed which was 

 
9 
C.R. No.233690 of 2018 & connected case 
 
mandatory while reversing the findings of the Trial Court, thus, 
substantial compliance of provisions of Order XLI Rule 31 CPC has 
not been made. A judgment should discuss and cover all substantial 
points involved in the case and also should reflect that Court has 
scanned and examined the material available on record minutely as 
well as evidence adduced by the parties supported with relevant 
documents pragmatically. Compliance of Order XLI Rule 31 C.P.C. is 
mandatory in its nature and the Appellate Court could not evade these 
provisions by taking divergent view on erroneous surmises and 
conjectural presumptions. Such a practice of the Appellate Court, if 
allowed, would frustrate the whole scheme of legislature by attributing 
redundancy to such mandatory provisions of law, which cannot be 
countenanced. Rationale behind said provision is that not only the 
party losing the case but the next higher forum may also understand 
what weighed with the Court in deciding the lis against it. Reliance is 
placed upon Muhammad Iftikhar v. Nazakat Ali (2010 SCMR 
1868), Pakistan Refinery Ltd., Karachi v. Barrett Hodgson Pakistan 
(Pvt.) Ltd. and others (2019 SCMR 1726), Muzafar Iqbal v. Mst. 
Riffat Parveen and others (2023 SCMR 1652), Saeed Ullah Khan v. 
Muhammad Khalid and 3 others (2018 CLC 648), Muhammad Yousuf 
through Legal Heirs and 6 others v. Abdul Jabbar Qureshi through 
Legal heirs and 18 others (2019 YLR 1558) and Ali Muhammad and 
4 others v. Learned Additional District Judge-III, Dadu and 14 
others (2020 CLC 365). 
14. 
Learned counsel for respondent No.1 has referred to Order XII 
Rule 6 CPC and Articles 81 & 113 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 to contend that in view of admission of Mst. Qamar Bibi (since 
deceased) in her application under Order IX Rule 6 read with Section 
151 CPC (filed in respondent No.1’s suit for permanent injunction), 
the suit should have been decreed by the Trial Court binding 
respondent No.1 to pay the balance sale consideration. This argument 
is not tenable for the reasons: firstly, the admission was conditional 
subject to payment of balance sale consideration, therefore, it was 
incumbent upon respondent No.1 to respond to said offer and make 
payment of balance sale consideration; and secondly,  no doubt, Order 

 
10 
C.R. No.233690 of 2018 & connected case 
 
XII Rule 6 CPC provides for powers of the Court to pass judgment on 
admissions but for returning such a judgment, the admission has to be 
clear, unambiguous, unqualified and unequivocal as held by the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as Messrs 
Kuwait National Real Estate Company (Pvt.) Ltd. and others v. 
Messrs Educational Excellence Ltd. and another (2020 SCMR 171) 
which is not the case here because Mst. Qamar Bibi (since deceased) 
asserted lapse on part of respondent No.1 to perform his part of the 
obligation and then made an offer to execute registered sale deed 
subject to payment of sale consideration. Furthermore, the Court when 
faced with such an eventuality has to exercise its discretion in a 
judicial manner, subject to qualification regarding maintainability of 
suit on any legal objection going to the very root of the matter. 
Needless to say that the Court can even require evidence regarding 
admission, in its discretion as provided by Article 113 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984. Reference can also be made to Zafar Ali v. 
Allah Bachayo (PLD 1989 Supreme Court 294) and Muhammad 
Zarin v. Amir Dil Khan and others (2022 MLD 1439). 
15. 
The case law relied upon by learned counsel for respondent 
No.1, being on distinguishable facts and circumstances, is not 
applicable to the present scenario.  
16. 
Resultantly, these revision petitions are allowed, impugned 
judgment & decree dated 21.05.2018 is set aside. Consequently, Trial 
Court’s judgment & decree dated 21.11.2015 is restored.
