Aalia Neelum, C.J.- Allah Rakha alias Mithu, son of Sardar and

Feeling aggrieved by the trial court's judgment, Allah Rakha alias 
Mithu and Muhammad Javed, the appellants have assailed their convictions by 
filing Crl. Appeal No.17661 of 2019. It is pertinent to mention here that the 
complainant also filed Crl. Rev. No.18883 of 2019 qua enhancement of sentence 
awarded to the appellants. The matters arising from the same trial court judgment 
are being disposed of through consolidated judgment. 
3.        
The prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex. PA/1) lodged on 
the complaint (Ex. PA) of Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant is that on 
25.06.2014, marriage ceremony of Zawar Hussain was scheduled and in 
connection of which, the complainant (PW-1) along with his brothers, Muhammad 
Irfan alias Khan (since dead) and Shahbaz (injured PW) were present there. On 
the same day, at about 5/6 p.m. evening, the appellants, along with their co-
accused persons, equipped with their respective weapons, came there and raised 
lalkara, that Muhammad Irfan alias Khan should have been taught a lesson for 
abducting the woman. After that, the accused persons started aerial firing; the 
accused, Allah Rakha, fired at Muhammad Irfan alias Khan, which hit the front of 
his chest, whereas the accused, Javed alias Jajju, fired at Muhammad Irfan alias 
Khan (since dead), which landed at right armpit of Muhammad Irfan alias Khan. 
After that, the accused, Javed, made a fire shot, which hit the left buttock of 
Shahbaz Ahmad (injured PW). The accused, Allah Rakha alias Mithu, also 
received injuries from the firing of his co-accused.  
 
The motive behind the occurrence was that one year prior to the 
alleged occurrence, Muhammad Irfan alias Khan (since dead) got married to a 
woman of the accused persons without the consent of the accused persons.  
4. 
 
Upon receiving the information of the occurrence, Muhammad 
Nawaz S.I. (PW-11) reached the place of occurrence, where the complainant (PW-
1), submitted an application (Ex. PA) to Muhammad Nawaz S.I. (PW-11) for 
registration of F.I.R; after that, on completion of police karawai, Muhammad 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019 
3 
Nawaz S.I. (PW-11) sent the same to the Police Station through Imdad Hussain 
538/C (not cited as a witness), whereupon formal F.I.R. (Exh. PA/1) was chalked 
out by Muhammad Arif, Head Constable (PW-5). 
5. 
 
After registration of the case, the investigation of this case was 
conducted by Muhammad Nawaz, S.I. (PW-11), who, having found the appellants 
guilty, prepared a challan under section 173 Cr.P.C. and sent the same to the court 
of competent jurisdiction. On 02.02.2018, the trial court formally charge-sheeted 
the appellants, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In support of its 
version, the prosecution produced as many as thirteen (13) witnesses.  
6. 
 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the appellants were 
examined under Section 342 of Cr.P.C., wherein neither they opted to appear as 
their own witnesses in terms of Section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. nor to produce evidence in 
their defence. In response to a particular question that why this case was against 
them and why the PWs had deposed against them, the appellants made the 
following depositions: - 
“Sometime prior to the occurrence Irfan deceased 
kidnapped Gul Naz and took her to Faisalabad. I 
got returned Gul Naz from Irfan deceased through 
punchait due to the grudge the complainant booked 
me in this false case. All the PWs are inter-se related 
and deposed against me with malafide intention.” 
 
7. 
 
After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence available on 
record in the light of the arguments advanced by both sides, the trial court found 
the prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which 
resulted in the appellants' conviction in the afore-stated terms. 
8. 
 
 I have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the 
parties and have minutely perused the record on the file.

9. 
 
In the instance case, the occurrence occurred on 25.06.2014 at 
05/06:00 p.m. in Chak No.442/J.B. situated within the jurisdiction of Police 
Station, Mochiwala, District Jhang, which is 14 miles from the place of 
occurrence. Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant, brother of Muhammad 
Irfan (the deceased) and Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-injured, reported the incident 
through written application (Ex. PA) to Muhammad Nawaz, S.I. (PW-11)-the 
investigating officer at Chak No.442/J.B at 08:15 p.m., whereupon Muhammad 
Nawaz S.I. (PW-11) incorporated police proceedings at the end of written 
complaint (Ex. PA) and sent the same through Imdad Hussain 538/C (not cited as 
witness) to the police station, based on which, formal F.I.R. (Exh. PA/1) was 
chalked out on the same day at 09:00 p.m. by Muhammad Arif 980/HC (PW-5). 
Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during his examination-in-
chief that: - 
“I was about to move to police station but the 
police reached at the spot. After taking down 
the application Exh. P-A I presented the same 
before the police. Exh. P-A bear my thumb 
impression. The contents of the application are 
true." 
Whereas, during cross-examination, he (PW-1)-the complainant, deposed that- 
“I got written the application for registration of 
case from Safdar but he is not the witness of the 
case. Safdar did not make any statement to the 
I.O.” 
Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-the injured witness deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“When 
police 
reached 
at 
the 
place 
of 
occurrence first of all my elder brother 
presented application to police at the place of 
occurrence.” 
Riaz Ahmad (PW-3)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination that: - 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019 
5 
“Afzal got drafted application for registration 
of case prior to the arrival of police. Pen and 
papers were brought by Safdar for drafting 
application for registration of case. Safdar is 
not related to me however he is related to the 
complainant party. -------- The house of Safdar 
is situated at a distance of 1 k.m from the place 
of occurrence.” 
 
 
It is the prosecution's case that after the occurrence, Muhammad 
Afzal (PW-1), the complainant, was about to move to the police station, but the 
police arrived.  It is relevant to mention that the occurrence occurred at 05/06:00 
p.m. and was reported to the police at 08:15 p.m. on 25.06.2014. Shahbaz Ali 
(PW-2)-the injured witness remained at the place of the incident for about two 
hours, but none of the prosecution witnesses made a complaint about the incident 
nor shifted him to the hospital in the injured condition. Therefore, non-shifting the 
injured to the hospital for medical treatment for about two hours was unnatural 
conduct. Besides, it is an admitted fact that Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the 
complainant got, drafted the application for registration of the case from one 
“Safdar”. Non-mentioning this fact in the application/complaint (Ex. PA) 
indicates that the complainant (PW-1) had not stated the complete truth and that 
the F.I.R. came into existence after due deliberations and consultations. When and 
where was the complaint (Ex. PA) prepared? The complaint's author should have 
stated that he prepared the complaint under the instructions of the complainant. It 
is also not a case of the prosecution that the complainant (PW-1) asked "Safdar” 
to prepare a complaint. Accordingly, the complaint was prepared by "Safdar," 
which was shown to the complainant and read over to him, which was thumb 
marked by him. Even the complainant had not explained the preparation of the 
complaint in the complaint and his statement before the trial court; therefore, in 
these circumstances, the chance of consultations and deliberations on the part of 
the complainant cannot be ruled out. Even the complainant did not give any 
explanation regarding a delay in lodging the report and about the preparation of 
the complaint in the complaint as well as in his statement before the learned trial 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019 
6 
court; therefore, in these circumstances, the chance of consultations and 
deliberations on the part of the complainant cannot be ruled out. It creates the first 
dent in the prosecution case.  
10. 
 
There is another aspect of the case; the legal position is well settled, 
and the evidence of an injured witness must be given due weightage of being a 
stamped witness. Thus, his presence cannot be doubted. The statement of the 
injured PW is generally considered to be very reliable, and it is unlikely that he 
would spare the actual assailant to implicate someone else falsely. Testimony of 
an injured witness has its relevancy and efficacy as he has sustained injuries at the 
time and place of occurrence. This lends support to his testimony that he was 
present during the occurrence. Testimony of an injured witness is accorded a 
special status in law, and such a witness would not let his actual assailant go 
unpunished merely to implicate a third person falsely for the commission of the 
offence. Thus, the evidence of the injured witness must be relied upon unless there 
are convincing grounds for the rejection of his evidence. On the touchstone of the 
position of law noted above, I shall now discuss the evidence of the material 
witnesses. As per the prosecution case, the occurrence was witnessed by 
Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant; Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-the injured; and 
Riaz Ahmad (PW-3)-the eye witness. Admittedly, during the incident, Shahbaz 
Ali (PW-2) received firearm injuries, and the matter was reported to the police at 
08:15 p.m. Muhammad Nawaz S.I. (PW-11)-the investigating officer deposed 
during cross-examination that: - 
“The Imdad Hussain constable who had taken 
the complaint for lodging of F.I.R came to the 
place of occurrence after two hours of sending 
Shahbaz pw to hospital.” 
 
 
Admittedly, Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-the injured, remained lying at the 
place of occurrence in injured condition, and both, i.e., Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-
the complainant, and Riaz Ahmad (PW-3) have not tried to shift him to the 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019 
7 
hospital for medical treatment. Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant 
admitted during cross-examination that: - 
“Shahbaz remained lying in injured condition 
for about 2 hours at the place of occurrence.” 
 
 
Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-injured PW, deposed during his examination-in-
chief; after the incident, he was shifted to District Headquarter Hospital, Jhang, by 
1122 ambulance service; from there, he was taken to RHC Mochiwala. After 
medical treatment, he (PW-2) was referred to the District Headquarters Hospital, 
Jhang. From District Headquarters Hospital, Jhang, he was shifted/referred to 
Allied Hospital Faisalabad. Then, he (PW-2) was shifted to District Headquarters 
Hospital Faisalabad, where he (PW-2) was operated. Whereas, on perusal of the 
medico-legal examination report of Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-injured, it reveals that he 
was medically examined at 02:40 a.m. on 26.06.2014 with the history mentioned 
in the column of “Brief History” of MLC that “fight at the marriage in Chak 
No.442/J.B. and firing as told by the victim” brought by Muhammad Hussain 
1572/C. Coming to the evidence of Shahbaz Ali (PW-2), a careful perusal of his 
evidence would clearly show that it is replete with inherent improbabilities and 
full of severe contradictions and meaningful improvements. After giving the 
narrative of the occurrence, he detailed what happened after the occurrence; the 
witness goes on to state that after the occurrence, he was shifted to the hospital by 
the 1122 ambulance service, and his statement under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. was 
recorded by the investigating officer 22 days after the occurrence. Shahbaz Ali 
(PW-2) deposed during the examination-in-chief that: - 
“The accused made incriminate firing. On 
hearing the fire report Riaz s/o Dalmeer and 
Amin s/o Mukhtar alongwith many other 
residence of vicinity attracted to the spot and 
witnessed the occurrence. I was shifted to 
District Headquarter hospital Jhang by 1122 
ambulance service. From there I was taken to 
RHC Mochiwala. From where after medico 
legal examination I was again referred to 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019 
8 
District Headquarter Hospital Jhang. From 
District Headquarter Hospital Jhang I was 
shifted/referred to Allied Hospital Faisalabad. 
Then I was shifted to District Headquarter 
Hospital Faisalabad where I was operated. ------
-------I remained admitted in hospital for about 
22 days. My statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. was 
recorded by the police at District Headquarter 
Hospital Jhang.” 
Contrary to the above deposition, Shahbaz Ali (PW-2) deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“My examination-in-chief was recorded on 
03.02.2018 
before 
this 
court.----------Pw 
volunteered that after recording my statement 
u/s 161 Cr.P.C. I was shifted to hospital.---------
Soon after reaching the police party 1122 
ambulance service reached at the spot. My 
statement was not recorded at hospital. I did 
not get record in my examination-in-chief 
recorded on 03.02.2018 that my statement u/s 
161 
Cr.P.C. 
was 
recorded 
at 
District 
Headquarter 
Hospital 
Jhang.-------------My 
statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. was recorded when I 
was still lying on the ground. I made statement 
before DSP in which I informed that I was 
shifted to District Headquarter Hospital Jhang 
by 1122 service and from there to RHC 
Mochiwala.----------After about 1 month of the 
occurrence I joined the investigation before the 
DSP. Pw volunteered that I remained admit in 
hospital 
for 
about 
22 
days.-----------Pw 
volunteered that I was shifted to hospital. When 
police reached at the place of occurrence 
Ameen was present there.----------The police 
after receiving the application for registration 
of case proceeded towards me and recorded my 
statement.” 
Muhammad Nawaz, S.I. (PW-11)-the investigating officer deposed during the 
examination-in-chief that: - 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019 
9 
“I prepared the injury statement Exh.P-H with 
regard to Shahbaz Ahmed injured. I recorded 
his statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. and sent him to 
hospital 
through 
1122 
ambulance 
with 
Muhammad Hussain 1572/C-1 for medico legal 
examination. ------------I was present at the 
place of occurrence and after 12:00 (midnight) 
the next day started. So, on 26.06.2014 
Muhammad Hussain 1572/C presented to me 
the MLC No.297/14 of Shahbaz injured which I 
annexed with the police.” He (PW-11)-the 
investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that, “I did not go to the hospital 
for recording statement of Shahbaz pw. Pw 
volunteered that I recorded his statement at the 
place of occurrence. Soon after recording 
statement of Shahbaz I sent him to hospital.” 
 
 
As per the prosecution case, Shahbaz Ali (PW-2), the injured 
witness, stated that soon after the occurrence, he was shifted to the hospital for 
medical treatment, and he made a contradictory statement about the recording of 
his statement by the investigating officer. Dr. Ashiq Hussain (PW-8) deposed 
during the examination-in-chief that: -  
“On 26.06.2014 I was posted as M.O RHC 
Mochiwala. On the same day, Shahbaz Ahmed 
s/o Inayat Ali caste Jutt aged about 32 years 
was brought at RHC by Muhammad Hussain 
1572/C for medico legal examination. It was a 
case having history of fight at marriage in Chak 
No.442/JB with history of firing as told by the 
victim.” 
 
 
On perusal of the medico-legal examination certificate (Ex. PH), it 
reveals that the injured arrived at 02:40 a.m. on 26.06.2014 after registration of 
FIR, and its reference was given in the column “No. & date of Police docket/Court 
Order.”  The witness does not provide any explanation as to why he did not ask 
Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant, and Riaz Ahmad (PW-3) to shift him 
to the hospital, particularly when he was injured. I find it difficult to believe that 
although such a severe occurrence had taken place, resulting in gunshot injuries to 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019 
10
the deceased and injured P.W., the informant took no steps to inform anybody, 
and nobody came to the scene of the occurrence. Such unnatural conduct can only 
be consistent with the fact that prosecution witnesses i.e. Muhammad Afzal (PW-
1)-the complainant and Riaz Ahmad (PW-3) were not present at the place of 
occurrence. The informant also does not give any explanation as to why he took 
six hours and twenty-five minutes from the time of the recording of the FIR to 
reach the hospital for medical treatment. Besides Shahbaz Ali (PW-2), who 
deposed during the examination-in-chief that:  
"I remained admitted in hospital for about 22 
days. My statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. was 
recorded by the police at District Headquarter 
Hospital Jhang."  
 
 
The statement of the prosecution witness should be recorded as 
promptly as possible, without giving him any opportunity to improve upon and 
subtract from what he saw. Since the delay is likely to give an opportunity to a 
witness to concoct a different version. However, the testimony of the injured 
witness creates doubt about the date and place of recording his statement under 
section 161 of Cr.P.C. The testimony of a witness had proved fatal and sounded 
the death knell for the prosecution case. Considered against this background, the 
argument of the learned counsel for the appellants that the evidence of 
eyewitnesses was inconsistent with the medical evidence appears to be well found. 
The medical evidence, therefore, clearly falsifies the prosecution's case regarding 
how the deceased and injured witness were hit. There is another vital defect in the 
prosecution case; according to the prosecution, the appellants had fired shots from 
eight (8) feet. According to the site plan, Irfan alias Khan, deceased, is at point 
“1,” Shahbaz Ali (PW-2) at point “2,” and the appellants, along with other 
accused, are at point (3). The distance between points "1 and 2" and point “3” is 5 
feet and 8 feet, respectively. The unscaled site plan (Ex. PQ) and scaled site plan 
(Ex. PK), which was prepared at the pointing of the prosecution witnesses. At the 
same time, the medical evidence states that there is blackening and burning on all 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019 
11
the injuries, indicating that the fire shots were made from very close range. The 
injured witness gave false evidence to strengthen the case of the prosecution. The 
oral testimony is contrary to the documentary evidence in the shape of an un-
scaled site plan (Ex. PQ) and scaled site plan (Ex. PK). Muhammad Afzal (PW-
1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I got prepared the site plan of the place of 
occurrence. I got written the names of accused 
persons to the I.O at the time of preparation of 
unscaled site plan confronted with Exh.PQ 
where the names of accused are not written.-----
-----The I.O prepared the site plan correctly." 
Riaz Ahmad (PW-3)-the eye witness deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“At the time of preparation of unscaled site 
plan I was present there. I pointed out to the 
I.O the place of presence of accused at the time 
of occurrence at the time of preparation of 
unscaled site plan. I did not point out the place 
of presence of accused on soling. The accused 
persons were present towards West from the 
cot of Irfan deceased.” 
 
 
Although the site plan is not a substantive piece of evidence in 
Article 22 of the Qanune-e-Shahdat Order 1984 as held in the case of Mst. 
Shamim Akhtar v. Fiaz Akhter and two others (PLD 1992 SC 211), but it 
reflects the view of the crime scene, and the same can be used to contradict or 
disbelieve eyewitnesses. During the incident, Allah Rakha, the accused-appellant, 
also received injuries; however, the injuries sustained by Allah Rakha, the 
accused-appellant, were concealed by the prosecution. Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-
the complainant deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“All the accused fled away from the place of 
occurrence. Allah Rakha accused in injured 
condition also ran away to his Haveli which was 
situated at a distance of 4 acre and there fell 
down. Police picked the accused Allah Rakha 
on the day of occurrence from his Haveli. 
However, it is not my knowledge whether he 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019 
12
was arrested or not. I did not accompany 
Shahbaz injured to the hospital. -----------Our 
injured Shahbaz was shifted to hospital first 
and later on Allah Rakha accused was shifted to 
hospital. After about 30 minutes of his arrival 
the I.O had gone to the Haveli of the accused.---
-------Shahbaz and other accused in private 
complaint filed by the accused of F.I.R. they 
were summoned by the court and they are 
facing trial in the said complaint. " 
Dr. Ashiq Hussain (PW-8) deposed during the examination-in-chief that: -  
“On the same day at 2:30 a.m I also examined, 
Allah Rakha s/o Sardar Caste Jutt aged about 
26 years R/o Chak No.442/JB Police Station 
Mochiwala 
who 
was 
brought 
at 
RHC 
Mochiwala by Muhammad Hussain 1572/C for 
medico legal examination, with history of fight 
at marriage in Chak No.442/J.B.” 
 
 
Allah Rakha, the accused-appellant, was medically examined before 
Shahbaz Ali (PW-2), the injured witness. Muhammad Nawaz, S.I. (PW-11)-the 
investigating officer deposed during the cross-examination that: - 
“I do not remember if I got recorded regarding 
preparation of injury statement of Allah Rakha, 
handing him with the injury statement to 
Muhammad Hussain 1572/C for his medical 
examination in my examination-in-chief or not. 
--------------Muhammad Hussain 1572/C also 
produced before me the MLC of Allah Rakha. 
The MLC number of Shahbaz is 296/14, again 
said the MLC of Shahbaz is 297/14.------------
The MLC No.296/14 pertains to Allah Rakha 
accused.” 
Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“During fight Allah Rakha also received fire 
injury.” 
 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019 
13
 
 
So, the injuries on the person of Allah Rakha, the accused-appellant, 
negate the mode and manner of the occurrence. In such circumstances, it could 
not be ruled out that the witnesses had suppressed the original occurrence and had 
thus not presented the actual version. All these circumstances make the presence 
of the eyewitnesses, i.e., Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant, and Riaz 
Ahmad (PW-3)-the eyewitness, at the spot doubtful.  
11. 
 
Another aspect of the case makes the presence of the eyewitnesses at 
the spot doubtful. The postmortem report (Exh. PM) of Muhammad Irfan alias 
Khan (the deceased) reveals that death took place at 07:30 p.m. on 25.06.2014, the 
dead body was brought to the dead house at 05:20 a.m. on 26.06.2014, complete 
police documents were received at 05:25 a.m., and the autopsy was conducted at 
05:30 a.m. on 26.06.2014. Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant deposed 
during cross-examination that: - 
“Q. Is it correct that the deceased met his death 
at 07:30 p.m. 
Ans. After the pause of more than 30 second the 
witness replied that I am illiterate.” 
 
 
However, it is the prosecution's case that the incident occurred at 
5/6:00 p.m. on 25.06.2014. As per the postmortem report (Exh. PM), the probable 
time that elapsed between injuries and death was immediate, whereas between 
death and postmortem was within 10 hours. The injury statement (Ex. PN) for 
conducting the postmortem examination on the dead body of Muhammad Irfan 
alias Khan (the deceased) reveals that the same was received by the medical 
officer on 26.06.2014 at 05:10 a.m. As per the prosecution case, the FIR was 
registered at 09:00 p.m. However, no plausible explanation has been rendered as 
to why the postmortem examination of the dead body of the deceased was delayed 
by 08 hours and 30 minutes from the time of registration of the case. It is admitted 
that the FIR was registered at 09:00 p.m., but the reference to the same has not 
been given in the inquest report (Ex. PP). In the inquest report (Ex. PP), in the 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019 
14
column related to the brief history of the case, the investigating officer has 
mentioned: -

Dr. Shafqat Mumtaz (PW-9) deposed during the examination-in-chief that: - 
“I handed over well stitched body carbon copy 
of PMR No.34/14 and last worn clothes of 
deceased and police papers to Riaz Hussain 
446/C. Exh.P-M is correct copy of postmortem 
report issued by me. Exh.P-M/1-2 are sketch of 
injuries. I also endorsed injury statement 
Exh.P-N and inquest report Exh.P-P.” 
 
 
There was no reason for the prosecution not to send the copy of 
the FIR alongwith above said documents for conducting the postmortem 
examination on the dead body of Muhammad Irfan alias Khan to Dr. Shafqat 
Mumtaz (PW-9). In addition, in column No.4 of the inquest report (Ex. PP) 
prepared by Muhammad Nawaz S.I. (PW-11), the investigating officer, the names 
of the witnesses who identified the dead body were mentioned as “Abdul Majeed 
s/o Ch. Muhammad Din and Muhammad Naseer s/o Abdul Haq.” Suleman and 
Baba Jafar were mentioned on the last page of the inquest report (Ex. PP). The 
names of the prosecution witnesses and the complainant have not been mentioned 
in the inquest report (Ex. PP). This outrightly suggests that the complainant (PW-
1) and Riaz Ahmad (PW-3), were not present at the time the inquest report in this 
case was prepared. These circumstances, to my mind, suggest that the FIR was 
ante timed. Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“Abdul Majeed s/o Umar Din and Naseer s/o 
Abdul received the dead body from hospital 
after autopsy. ----------Naseer Pw is also resident 
of same Chak. Abdul Majeed is resident of 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

Chak No.443. Baber Jafer is resident of Chak 
No.441.” 
Muhammad Nawaz S.I. (PW-11)-the investigating officer deposed during cross-
examination that: - 
“The Imdad Hussain constable who had taken 
the complaint for lodging of F.I.R. came to the 
place of occurrence after two hours of sending 
Shahbaz pw to hospital. --------------- The injury 
statement of Shahbaz is before me which bears 
case F.I.R No etc.” 
 
 
All the above-said facts throw a cloud of doubt that the F.I.R. was 
recorded with a delay, and the FIR has not been recorded when it is claimed to 
have been recorded. Considering all these facts, I have no hesitation in concluding 
that the prosecution has not been able to prove on record that the incident was 
reported when it was claimed to have been recorded.  
12. 
 
As far as motive is concerned, it is a double-edged sword that cuts 
both sides/ways. In the instant case, Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant, 
brother of Muhammad Irfan (the deceased) and Shahbaz Ali (PW-2)-injured, 
deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
"Motive behind the occurrence was that one year 
prior to the occurrence, daughter of Mushtaq s/o 
Hakim Ali was eloped with Muhammad Irfan and 
she contacted marriage with Muhammad Irfan with 
her free will and against the wishes of her 
parents/family. Due to this grudge the accused 
with common intention committed the Qatl-e-Amd 
of Muhammad Irfan and made murders assault of 
Shahbaz Ahmed. Due to the effort of elders said 
girl was returned to her parents as a compromise 
has been effected between the parties and after one 
month the lady was divorced by the deceased. The 
accused present in court committed the occurrence 
on the instance of Mushtaq, Ali Muhammad, 
Ishaq, Ashfaq and Abbas."   
Whereas, Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant, deposed during cross-
examination that: -  

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019

“One year prior to the occurrence Gulnaz left 
her house on her own and came to the house of 
Irfan and she was not abducted by anyone. 
Gulnaz was returned back through Punchait. 
Irfan divorced her. Gulnaz is alive.”   
 
 
The deposition of Muhammad Afzal (PW-1)-the complainant, reveals 
that a compromise was effected between the parties, and no one abducted Gulnaz; 
instead, she left by herself. Therefore, this court is not satisfied that the 
prosecution has established a sufficient motive for the accused to commit the 
alleged crime. Therefore, the evidence led by the prosecution in connection with 
the motive is insufficient for relying on the testimonies of the witnesses. Now, it is 
trite law that enmity is a double-edged weapon. The existence of a motive on the 
part of the accused may be a reason for committing the crime, yet the Court has to 
be cognizant of the fact that this may, in a given case, lead to the false implication 
of the appellants. Motive is a double-edged weapon for the occurrence and false 
implications. There are always different motives in the person's mind for making 
false accusations. The motive for the commission of the crime by the accused was 
not proved through cogent and convincing evidence. In the circumstances, I 
cannot avoid the conclusion that the alleged motive was an afterthought and has 
not been proved by any credible evidence.   
13. 
 
The report of Forensic Science Laboratory, Punjab, Lahore (Ex. PT) 
is only to the effect that the weapon allegedly recovered from the 
accused/appellant No. 1-Allah Rakha was in mechanical operating condition. So, 
the recovery of the weapon from the accused/appellant No. 1-Allah Rakha is of no 
consequence. Accordingly, the accused/appellant No. 1-Allah Rakha deserves to 
be given the benefit of the doubt, and findings in this regard are to be set aside, 
and the same are set aside.  
14. 
 
As it is difficult to rely upon the testimonies of Muhammad Afzal 
(PW-1), the complainant, Shahbaz Ali (PW-2), and Riaz Ahmad (PW-3), and for 
other reasons enumerated hereinbefore, I am persuaded to hold that the 
prosecution had not been able to prove its case against the appellants beyond 

Crl. Appeal No. 17661 of 2019 &  
Crl.Rev. No. 18883 of 2019 
17
shadow of doubt as there were many dents in the prosecution story. The 
conviction and sentence the learned trial court recorded cannot be sustained.  
Reliance has been placed on the case reported as “Muhammad Akram  v.  The 
State” (2009 SCMR 230), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has 
held that even a single circumstance creating reasonable doubts in a prudent mind 
about the guilt of the accused makes him entitled to the benefit, not as a matter of 
grace and concession but as a matter of right. 
15. 
 
The upshot of the above discussion is that the prosecution had badly 
failed to bring home a charge against the appellants beyond any reasonable doubt; 
therefore, in the interest of the safe administration of Criminal Justice, Criminal 
Appeal No.17661 of 2019 filed by Allah Rakha alias Mithu and Muhammad 
Javed, appellants is accepted in toto.   The conviction and sentence awarded by 
the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Jhang vide judgment dated 28.02.2019 is 
set aside, and the appellants are acquitted of the charge. The appellant-
Muhammad Javed s/o Mushtaq is directed to be released forthwith if not required 
in any other criminal case. Meanwhile, the appellant, Allah Rakha, is present on 
bail. His sureties stand discharged from the liability.  
16. 
 
So far as Criminal Revision No.18883 of 2019 filed by the 
complainant, Muhammad Afzal, for enhancement of compensation as well as 
sentence of the respondent Nos.1 & 2 awarded by the trial court is concerned, for 
the reasons afore-stated, the same is devoid of any legal force, which is 
accordingly dismissed.
