JAWAD HASSAN, J. This Reference Application under 
Section 133 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the 
“Ordinance”) has been filed by the Applicant, being dissatisfied 
by the order dated 02.03.2023 passed by the Appellate Tribunal 
Inland Revenue, Division Bench-I, Islamabad, (the “Appellate 
Tribunal”) in I.T.A.No.372/IB/2023 (Tax Year 2018). The 
following questions of law are said to arise out of the impugned 
order.- 
QUESTIONS OF LAW  
1). 
“Whether under the facts and circumstances 
of the case the learned ATIR was justified in 
upholding the orders of both the authorities 
below? 
2). 
“Whether under the facts and circumstances 
of the case the order of learned ATIR is a 
speaking order and is maintainable in the 
eye of law?  
3). 
“Whether under the facts and circumstances 
of the case the learned ATIR was not 
justified by not considering that order 
passed by Respondent No.5 has without 

I.T.R.No.03 of 2023

issuing 
mandatory 
separate/independent 
notice for making the additional u/s 111 of 
Ordinance? 
4). 
“Whether under the facts and circumstances 
of the case the learned ATIR has misdirect 
himself by not considering that addition un/s 
111(1)(b) 
can 
be 
made 
only 
after 
confronting 
by 
separate 
notice 
u/s 
111(1)(b)? 
5). 
“Whether under the facts and circumstances 
of the case the learned ATIR be read in 
isolation without making reference to 
Section 122(1), 122(5) and 122(9) of the 
Ordinance? 
 
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that a show cause notice dated 
14.12.2021 under Section 122(9) of the “Ordinance” for the tax 
year 2018 was issued against the applicant on the basis of 
definite information that he purchased property during aforesaid 
year but did not disclose its source. Reply to said show cause 
notice was filed but the Respondent No.5, being dissatisfied, 
passed assessment order on 05.03.2022, which was appealed 
before the Respondent No.3/Commissioner Inland Revenue 
(III), Rawalpindi. The said appeal was rejected vide order dated 
22.12.2022. Being dissatisfied, the applicant assailed aforesaid 
order before the “Appellant Tribunal” that met with the same 
fate vide order dated 02.03.2023. Hence, instant reference 
application. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the applicant inter alia submitted that 
the impugned order is illegal and contrary to the law and facts of 
the case; that compliance of mandatory provisions of Section 111 
of the “Ordinance” was not made; that the proceedings under 
Section 122(5) of the “Ordinance” can only be initiated if there is 
“definite information” because the information provided under 
Section 111 of the “Ordinance” is not “definite information” 
rather is mere information; that the “Appellate Tribunal” has not 
passed the above referred order in accordance with law and has 
fallen into error by dismissing appeal of the applicant.

4. 
On the other side, learned counsel for the Respondents 
submitted that the impugned order has been passed strictly in 
accordance with law and does not require any interference by this 
Court. He justified the decision merited towards the applicant and 
stated that no prejudice to the applicant has been made as 
substantial compliance of said provisions of law was in place and 
further submitted that as notice under Section 122(9) of the 
“Ordinance” was issued, therefore, there was no need to issue 
separate notice under Section 111 of the “Ordinance”. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
This case pertains to the issue of mandatory requirement for 
the issuance of separate notice under Section 111 of the 
“Ordinance” while conducting proceedings under show cause 
notice dated 14.12.2021 issued under Section 122(9) of the 
“Ordinance”, pursuant thereto, the Respondents Department 
concluded the proceeding against the applicant on the basis that he 
had purchased immoveable properties worth Rs.6,694,036/- but 
failed to declare its actual value and that he received a loan from 
individuals to the tune of Rs.12,500,000/- during the tax year 
2018. It is evident from show cause notice dated 14.12.2021 that it 
was issued under Section 122(9) of the “Ordinance” requiring the 
applicant to file reply and explain the sources, failing which, it 
would be added into income defined under Section 2(29) of the 
“Ordinance” and assessment would be amended in terms of 
Section 122(1) read with Section 111 of the “Ordinance”. The 
question that looms large before us is whether before invoking the 
provisions of Section 122 of the “Ordinance”, a separate notice to 
the taxpayer in terms of Section 111 of the “Ordinance”  
is pre-requisite to include unexplained income/assets in income 
chargeable to tax and without such notice substantial compliance 
of said provisions of law could be made or not and whether a 
notice under Section 122(9) of the “Ordinance” is enough to 
initiate proceedings for amendment of the assessment on the 

I.T.R.No.03 of 2023 
 
4 
grounds mentioned in Section 111 of the “Ordinance”? The case 
of the applicant is that the Respondent-department was required to 
issue a separate notice under Section 111 of the “Ordinance” 
while the stance of the Respondents-department is that there is no 
need to issue a sperate notice under the aforesaid section for 
proceeding under Section 122 of the “Ordinance”. The issuance 
of a separate notice under Section 111 of the “Ordinance” has 
been held as mandatory for the purpose of addition on account of 
unexplained income or assets by learned Division Bench of this 
Court in “COMMISSIONER INLAND REVENUE, T.R.O., 
FAISALABAD versus FAQIR HUSSAIN and another” (2019 PTD 
1828) wherein it has held as under: 
 "8. Perusal of the provisions of Section 111 of the 
Ordinance of 2001 shows that if the instances / 
categories of unexplained income and assets, 
mentioned therein, come to the knowledge of the 
Commissioner, he is not obliged to form an 
opinion on the basis of information so gathered 
rather is required to issue notice to the taxpayer 
seeking explanation, confronting the information 
collected that its case comes within the head(s) 
specified in subsection (1). Though word "notice" 
is not specifically mentioned in the said provisions 
of law but words "... the person offers no 
explanation..." and "or the explanation offered by 
the person is not, in the Commissioner's opinion, 
satisfactory..." 
clearly suggest that 
for an 
explanation to be offered by the person, he must 
have been issued a notice. After said notice and 
failure on the part of taxpayer to offer satisfactory 
explanation, such addition can be made in the 
income of the taxpayer. For an explanation to be 
offered by a registered person, he must have been 
issued a notice without which no explanation 
could be offered, within the contemplation of 
Section 111 of the Ordinance of 2001. Reference 
can be made to the cases of Messrs Ranipur CNG 
Station and Muhammad Shafique supra." 
"10. Non-issuance of separate notice under 
Section 111 has caused prejudice to respondent-
taxpayer as substantial compliance of said 
provisions of law has not been made. The ordinary 
meanings of "Notice" as referred to by learned 

I.T.R.No.03 of 2023 
 
5 
Legal 
Advisors, 
with 
reference 
to 
various 
dictionaries, are not applicable to the issue in 
hand. Non-issuance of proper notice in order to 
invoke provisions of Section 111 cannot be taken 
lightly and its non-compliance may lead to render 
the proceedings not in conformity with or 
according to the intent and purpose of law. In the 
instant case, neither notice under Section 111 of 
the Ordinance of 2001 has been issued to the 
taxpayer nor was the taxpayer specifically 
confronted with such proposed addition so that the 
taxpayer could have advanced some explanation in 
this regard. Thus, impugned addition appears to 
be without any lawful authority." 
 
  
This view was further fortified by one of us in 
“COMMISSIONER INLAND REVENUE, MULTAN ZONE 
versus FALAH UD DIN QURESHI” (2021 PTD 192) holding 
the issuance of notice under Section 111 of the “Ordinance” as 
mandatory and observed that “prior separate notice under 
Section 111 of the Ordinance, 2001 to confront the respondent 
for explaining his unexplained income and assets has not been 
issued prior to making of addition of income for tax purpose”. It 
is noted that the decision given by learned Division Bench in the 
case of “FAQIR HUSSAIN and another” supra, was challenged 
before the Supreme Court of Pakistan through Civil Petition 
No.2447-L of 2022 which has recently been decided on 
01.02.2024. The relevant paras Nos.9 and 10 of the said 
judgment are given as under:  
“9. 
Therefore, pursuant to Section 122(5) of the 
Ordinance, the terminus a quo for initiation of 
proceedings under Section 122 is when the 
Commissioner, on the basis of definite information 
acquired from an audit or otherwise, is of the 
opinion that any of the grounds mentioned in Section 
122(5)(i), (ii) or (iii) is applicable. Thereafter, a 
notice under Section 122(9) of the Ordinance, 
specifying the above ground(s), is sent to the 
taxpayer. If the taxpayer satisfactorily responds to 
the notice sent under Section 122(9), the proceedings 
can be dropped. Where, however, the response is not 
satisfactory, and the Commissioner is satisfied that 

I.T.R.No.03 of 2023 
 
6 
any of the grounds in Section 122(5) are applicable, 
the Commissioner can amend the assessment order 
under Section 122(1) or further amend an amended 
assessment under Section 122(4) read with Section 
122(5). As such, for initiation of proceedings under 
Section 122, the Commissioner must assess if any of 
the grounds under Section 122(5) are applicable, 
and such an assessment is to be based on definite 
information acquired from an audit or otherwise, 
which is the prerequisite to attract the provisions of 
Section 122(5) of the Ordinance. 
 
10. 
It is in this sequence of proceedings that the 
initiation and culmination of proceedings under 
Section 111 of the Ordinance becomes necessary 
before action can be taken under Section 122 to 
amend assessments on the basis of proceedings 
undertaken under Section 111. As noted above, the 
information available with the department under 
Section 111(1) is mere information. It is only after 
the taxpayer is confronted with this information 
through a separate notice by calling for an 
explanation, and when no explanation is offered or 
the explanation is not satisfactory in the opinion of 
the Commissioner under Section 111(1), that it 
transforms or crystallizes into “definite information” 
for the purposes of action under Section 122(5) for 
amendment of assessment under Section 122. The 
taxpayer will then be confronted with the grounds 
applicable under Section 122(5) through a notice 
under Section 122(9) of the Ordinance. As such, 
where the Commissioner has formed an opinion 
against the taxpayer as to the fulfilment of one of the 
grounds mentioned in Section 111(1)(a) to (d) of the 
Ordinance, and is of the view that any of the grounds 
in Section 122(5) is applicable, the process under 
Section 122 is to be initiated to amend assessments 
through a notice under Section 122(9). Thus, unless 
the proceedings under Section 111(1) are initiated 
and completed, Section 122(5) cannot be given effect 
to and no notice under Section 122(9) can be issued 
for the purposes of amending an assessment through 
an addition contemplated under Section 111. It is to 
be noted that the present cases are related to tax 
years up till 2020. After the amendment introduced 
in Section 122(5) of the Ordinance through the 
Finance Act, 2020, the words “definite information 
acquired from an audit or otherwise” have been 
substituted with “audit or on the basis of definite 
information”. Therefore, the interpretation rendered 

I.T.R.No.03 of 2023 
 
7 
above as to the applicability of Section 122(5) may 
not be applicable to cases post 2020 and the effect of 
the substituted expression will have to be determined 
in an appropriate case in the future. 
 
7. 
So far as the question what becomes “definite 
information”, has also been decided in above referred Civil 
Petition No.2447-L of 2022. Relevant part thereof reads as 
under: 
“Before an assessment can be amended under 
Section 122 on the basis of Section 111, the 
proceedings under Section 111(1) are to be 
initiated, the taxpayer is to be confronted with the 
information and the grounds applicable under 
Section 111(1) through a separate notice under 
the said provision, and then the proceedings are 
to be culminated through an appropriate order in 
the shape of an opinion of the Commissioner. 
This then becomes definite information for the 
purposes of Section 122(5), provided the grounds 
mentioned in Section 122(5) are applicable. The 
taxpayer is then to be confronted with these 
grounds through a notice under Section 122(9) 
and only then can an assessment be amended 
under Section 122.9 This view has also been 
recently taken by this Court in Bashir Ahmed 
wherein it has also been held that a notice under 
Section 111 can be simultaneously issued with a 
notice under Section 122(9), however, proceedings 
under Section 111 have to be finalized first in 
terms of an opinion of the Commissioner so as to 
constitute definite information, as is required 
under Section 122(5) of the Ordinance”. 
 
Emphasis supplied 
 
8. 
Since the issue regarding “definite information” has 
already been elaborated and interpreted by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan from time to time firstly in “Messrs CENTRAL 
INSURANCE CO. and others versus THE CENTRAL BOARD 
OF REVENUE, Islamabad and others” (1993 SCMR 1232) 
whereby it was held that “We are inclined to hold that the 
expression "definite information" will include factual information 

I.T.R.No.03 of 2023 
 
8 
as well as information about the existence of a binding judgment 
of a competent Court of law/forum for the purposes of section 65 
of the Ordinance, but any interpretation of a provision of law by a 
functionary which has not been entrusted with the functions to 
interpret such provision judicially, cannot be treated as a "definite 
information". Secondly, in “INCOME TAX OFFICER and another 
versus M/s CHAPPAL BUILDERS” (1993 PTD 1108) wherein it 
has held that “The expression "definite Information", and similar 
other expressions used in the above-noticed provisions or other 
related provisions certainly meant much more than mere material 
so as to cause a reasonable belief or even such evidence which 
might lead to a definite belief. Unless there is definite direct 
information and there is no further need to put the said definite 
information to trial by putting in further supporting material the 
process of self-assessment could not be reopened. In this case in 
order to establish through so-called `definite information', the 
department had to rely upon further reasoning in order to clothe 
their information with credibility what to talk of definiteness”. 
Thirdly, in “CHIEF COMMISSIONER INLAND REVENUE, RTO, 
Peshawar 
versus 
Messrs 
SABRINA 
TENT 
SERVICES”  
(2019 SCMR 1639) holding that “Definite information' does not 
mean a reanalysis of existing information or an analysis of further 
information that was previously accessible but had not been taken 
into account” and fourthly, in Civil Petition No.2447-L of 2022, 
referred above. While examining Sections 122 and 111 of the 
“Ordinance” in the perspective of “definite information”, the 
principles enunciated in above-referred judgments by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has been followed which are binding 
under Article 189 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973.  
9. 
Furthermore, the Federal Board of Revenue Inland 
Revenue, Revenue Division, Government of Pakistan has 
already 
issued 
instructions 
through 
notification 

I.T.R.No.03 of 2023 
 
9 
No.2(22)Rev.Bud./2020 dated 25th May, 2021 to the Chief 
Commissioners Inland Revenue, LTOs, MTO, CTOs, RTOs in 
the following manner: 
‘Representations have been received in the Board 
suggesting that field officers are recklessly issuing 
notices u/s 122(5) read with 122(9) of Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 (hereinafter “the Ordinance”) 
where purportedly the threshold of “definite 
information” as defined u/s 122(8) is not met. It 
goes without saying that amendment proceedings 
u/s 122(5) of the Ordinance, merely on the basis of 
audit suspicion picked from within the declarations 
lodged by the taxpayers themselves, is an 
enforcement travesty and need to abate. The scheme 
of law warrants that a taxpayer must be dealt with 
precisely as per principles of justice and fair play”.  
 
10. 
Needless to add that above instructions have also been 
brushed aside while passing the impugned orders from 
Assessing Officer till the “Appellate Tribunal”. 
11. 
In view of law laid down in aforementioned judgments, 
our answer to the proposed questions is in affirmative i.e. 
against the Respondents-Department and in favour of the 
applicant. 
12. 
Office shall send a copy of this order under seal of the 
Court to the “Appellate Tribunal” as per Section 133(5) of the 
“Ordinance”.
