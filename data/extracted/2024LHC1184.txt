-------------- 
Aalia Neelum, J.- Muhammad Asif, son of Muhammad Ashfaq, 
caste Arai, resident of Jamshed Town Bhaini Road, Sharif Pura Baghbanpura, 
District Lahore, was involved in case F.I.R. No.1086 of 2014, dated 09.12.2014, 
registered under Sections 302, 34 PPC, at Police Station, Shafiqabad, District 
Lahore and was tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore. The trial 
court seized with the matter in terms of the judgment dated 27.11.2018 convicted 
the appellant Muhammad Asif under section 302(b) PPC, and sentenced him to 
undergo imprisonment for life as Tazir with the direction to pay Rs.4,00,000/- as 
compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased and in case of default in payment 
thereof, to undergo six months S.I further. The benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. 
was also extended in favour of the appellant. 
2. 
 
Feeling aggrieved by the trial court's judgment, Muhammad Asif, the 
appellant, has assailed his conviction by filing instant Crl. Appeal No.6732-J of 
2019. 
3.        
The prosecution story as alleged in the F.I.R (Ex.PA/2) lodged on the 
written application (Ex.PA) of Zeeshan Khalid (PW-5)-the complainant is that he

(the complainant) was married to the daughter of Mst. Robina Shoaib (the 
deceased) three years back, and he was residing with his in-laws for two years; on 
08.12.2014 at 10:00 p.m., the complainant (PW-5) alongwith other family 
members was sleeping at home, when the door was knocked; the complainant 
(PW-5) and his mother in law, came at the door, opened the door and saw that 
accused Asif Ashfaq (the appellant) and Hamza Ashfaq (co-accused since 
acquitted) were standing there; the mother in law of the complainant, asked them, 
as to why they had come there; after that, they asked her to transfer her share of 
land situated in Mehmood Booti, in their names; the mother in law of the 
complainant refused to do so, after that hot words were exchanged; on hearing the 
voice of noise, his brother in law (سالہ), Sameer Gul Sher (PW-6) and neighbor 
Waseem Zafar (PW-7), reached the spot, while accused were speaking loudly. 
Meanwhile, the father of the accused, Mian Muhammad Ashfaq (co-accused since 
acquitted) also came there and raised lalkara to teach a lesson to her for not giving 
the land to them; both Muhammad Asif Ashfaq (the appellant) and Hamza Ashfaq 
(co-accused since acquitted) pulled out their pistols; Muhammad Asif Ashfaq (the 
appellant) made fire with his pistol, which hit on the abdomen of Robina Shoaib 
(the deceased), after touching her right wrist, who fell on the ground after 
sustaining injury. While Muhammad Asif Ashfaq (the appellant), Hamza Ashfaq 
(co-accused since acquitted), Mian Muhammad Ashfaq (co-accused since 
acquitted), alongwith one unknown accused, succeeded in fleeing away while 
boarding on motorcycles. The complainant, alongwith PWs, shifted Mst. Robina 
Shoaib (the deceased) to Mayo Hospital, Lahore, for treatment by a rickshaw, 
where the doctor declared her dead.  
4. 
 
Upon receiving the information of the occurrence, Rashad Ahmad 
S.I. (PW-1) reached Mayo Hospital, Lahore, where the complainant (PW-5) 
presented written application (Ex. PA)  before him, who on completion of police 
karawai sent the same to the Police Station through Iftikhar 12469/C (not cited as 
a witness) after that formal F.I.R. (Exh.PA/2) was chalked out by Ghulam 
Murtaza S.I (PW-3).

5. 
 
After registration of the case, the investigation of this case was 
conducted by Gulzar Ahmd S.I (PW-8) and Ghulam Muhammad S.I (PW-17), 
who, having found the appellant guilty, prepared a challan under section 173 
Cr.P.C. and sent the same to the court of competent jurisdiction while placing the 
names of all accused persons in Column No.3 of the challan. On 19.11.2018, the 
trial court formally charge-sheeted the appellant, to which he pleaded not guilty 
and claimed trial. In support of its version, the prosecution produced as many as 
eighteen (18) witnesses.  
6. 
 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the appellant was 
examined under Section 342 of Cr.P.C., wherein he neither opted to appear as his 
own witnesses in terms of Section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce any 
evidence in his defence. In response to a particular question of why this case was 
against him and why the PWs had deposed against him, the appellant-Muhammad 
Asif, made the following depositions: - 
“The witnesses are inimical and close relative 
of each other. Although I was not present at 
scene of occurrence, my name was given due 
to malice.”  
7. 
 
After recording evidence and evaluating the evidence available on 
record in the light of the arguments advanced by both sides, the trial court found 
the prosecution version proved beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt, which 
resulted in the appellant’s conviction in the afore-stated terms. 
8. 
 
I have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the 
parties and have minutely perused the record on the file.  
9. 
 
In the instant case, the incident occurred at 10:00 p.m. on 08.12.2014 
in the house of Mst. Robina Shoaib (the deceased), mother-in-law of Zeeshan 
Khalid (PW-5)-the complainant, situated at Kausar Pura, falling within the 
jurisdiction of Police Station Shafiqueabad, District Lahore, which is at a distance 
of two (02) Kilometers from the place of occurrence. Allegedly, the occurrence 
was witnessed by Zeeshan Khalid (PW-5)-the complainant, Sameer Gul Sher 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019 
 
 
 
4
(PW-6), and Waseem Zafar (PW-7). As per the prosecution case, accused Asif 
Ashfaq (the appellant) and Hamza Ashfaq (co-accused since acquitted) arrived at 
the house of Mst. Robina Shoaib (the deceased) and asked her to transfer her share 
of land situated in Mehmood Booti, in their names; on refusal of Mst. Robina 
Shoaib (then injured), hot words were exchanged; on hearing the voice of noise, 
Sameer Gul Sher (PW-6), son of the deceased and neighbor Waseem Zafar (PW-
7), attracted at the place of occurrence; during the foregoing incident, Mian 
Muhammad Ashfaq (co-accused since acquitted) also came there and raised 
lalkara to teach her lesson for not giving the land to them; upon which 
Muhammad Asif Ashfaq (the appellant) and Hamza Ashfaq (co-accused since 
acquitted) took out their pistols and Muhammad Asif Ashfaq (the appellant) made 
fire with his pistol, which hit on the abdomen of Mst. Robina Shoaib (the 
deceased), after touching her right wrist, who fell on the ground after sustaining 
an injury; the accused persons Muhammad Asif Ashfaq (the appellant), Hamza 
Ashfaq (co-accused since acquitted), Mian Muhammad Ashfaq (co-accused since 
acquitted) alongwith one unknown accused while boarding on their motorcycles, 
waving weapons, fled away from the place of occurrence. Zeeshan Khalid (PW-
5)-the complainant, alongwith Sameer Gul Sher (PW-6) and Waseem Zafar (PW-
7), put Mst. Robina Shoaib (then injured) in the rickshaw and shifted her for 
treatment at Mayo Hospital, Lahore. On reaching the hospital, the doctor, after 
checking Mst. Robina Shoaib informed them that she succumbed to the injuries. 
After that, the matter was reported to the police by Zeeshan Khalid (PW-5)-the 
complainant. 
Zeeshan 
Khalid 
(PW-5)-the 
complainant 
deposed 
during 
examination-in-chief that: - 
“Doctor issued documents regarding incident and 
we took them to the police station. Police came at 
the place of occurrence and hospital as well. Then 
we reached at police station for registration of 
FIR. He (PW-5) also deposed during cross-
examination that, “I do not remember when we 
reached at police station whether blood stained 
clothes were observed by the police officer on 
duty. When we (Waseem Zafar, Sameer Shoaib 
and Zeshan) went to P.S. for registration of case 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019 
 
 
 
5
we did not offer police officer to take our clothes 
as they were blood stained nor I.O. had taken the 
same into his possession. The statements of other 
two witnesses were also recorded by the police 
officer. It is incorrect to suggest that we did not go 
to P.S. for registration of the case.” 
 
Similarly, Sameer Gul Sher (PW-6) deposed during cross-examination that: - 
“I alongwith Zeshan, Waseem went to police 
station and Zeshan got registered FIR where 
police officials recorded the statement of Zeshan. 
At that time my statement and statement of 
Waseem were not recorded by the police.” 
 
Waseem Zafar (PW-7) deposed in his examination in chief that - 
“Doctor handed over us concerned documents 
then we went to police station for lodging FIR.” 
 
Whereas, on perusal of the written complaint (Ex. PA), it reveals that at the 
bottom of the written complaint (Ex. PA), Rashid Ahmad S.I. (PW-1) 
incorporated police proceedings (Ex. PA/1) by mentioning that the incident was 
reported by Zeeshan Khalid (PW-5)-the complainant at Emergency Ward of Mayo 
Hospital, Lahore on 08.12.2014. The scanned copy of the police proceedings 
(Ex.PA/1) is as follows: 
 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019 
 
 
 
6
The police proceeding (Ex.PA/1) incorporated at the bottom of the written 
complaint (Ex.PA) created doubt in the version of the prosecution that the incident 
was reported at the police station. Besides, contrary to the depositions of Zeeshan 
Khalid (PW-5)-the complainant, Sameer Gul Sher (PW-6) and Waseem Zafar 
(PW-7), Rashid Ahmad S.I. (PW-1) deposed during the examination in chief that:- 
“On 08.12.2014 I was posted at P.S. Shafiqueabad, 
Lahore. On the same day I alongwith Iftikhar 
Ahmad and Kashif Ali constables was present 
Kasurpura 
for 
patrolling. 
On 
receiving 
information from City Control I reached at Mayo 
Hospital, Lahore where the complainant Zeshan 
Khalid presented before me an application Ex.PA 
for registration of FIR upon which I wrote police 
proceedings 
Ex.PA/1 
the 
same 
is 
in 
my 
handwriting and bears my signatures.” 
 
 
As per the prosecution case, the incident took place on 08.12.2014 at 
10:00 p.m., and as per the police proceedings, the incident was reported by 
Zeeshan Khalid (PW-5)-the complainant at Emergency Ward Mayo Hospital, 
Lahore, at 11:45 p.m. on 08.12.2014 and police proceedings were incorporated by 
Rashid Ahmad (PW-1) at the bottom of the written complaint (Ex. PA), who 
referred the written complaint (Ex. PA) through Iftikhar Ali 12469/C (PW-11) to 
the police station for chalking out formal FIR (Ex.PA/2). Iftikhar Ali 12469/C 
(PW-11) deposed during his court statement that on 09.12.2014, he, alongwith 
Kashif/C (given up PW) and Rashid Ahmad S.I. (PW-1), was on patrolling, when 
Rashid Ahmad (PW-1) received information of the occurrence. Iftikhar Ali 
12469/C (PW-11), alongwith Kashif/C (given up PW) and Rashid S.I. (PW-1), 
went to Mayo Hospital and took into possession the dead body of the deceased 
Robina Bibi. During cross-examination, Iftikhar Ali 12469/C (PW-11) deposed 
that:- 
“Rashid SI handed over dead body of deceased 
Robina to me at emergency ward of Mayo 
hospital in the presence of Kashif/C. No other 
person known to me was present at that time. 
Rashid SI handed over dead body to me after 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019 
 
 
 
7
completing proceedings of filling the relevant 
form etc. regarding the handing over dead body.” 
 
 
Ghulam Murtaza S.I. (PW-3) deposed during examination-in-chief 
that on 09.12.2014, the written complaint (Ex. PA) was received by him through 
constable Iftikhar (not mentioned belt number of constable), on which the police 
proceedings (Ex.PA/1) were recorded by Rashid Ahmad S.I. (PW-1) for 
registration of FIR. He (PW-3) lodged a formal FIR (Ex.PA/2) without any 
omission or deletion. During examination-in-chief, Rashid Ahmad S.I. (PW-1) 
deposed that Iftikhar Ahmad and Kashif Ali Constables were with him on 
08.12.2014 when he (PW-1) received information from City Control. The 
investigation of the case was entrusted to Gulzar Ahmad S.I. (PW-8)-the 
investigating officer, who deposed during examination in chief that: - 
“Stated that on 08.12.2014, I was posted at police 
station Shafiqueabad, Lahore. I received the 
information of incident and reached at the place 
of occurrence. There I came to know that injured 
has been escorted by Rashid Ahmad SI alongwith 
legal heirs of the deceased to Mayo Hospital. On 
09.12.2014 
investigation 
of 
this 
case 
was 
entrusted to me. I alongwith my officials reached 
Mayo hospital, inspected the dead body at dead 
house and sent the dead body to mortuary for 
Postmortem examination and came at the place 
of occurrence alongwith PWs.” 
During cross-examination, Gulzar Ahmad S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, 
deposed as under: - 
“We proceeded from the police station at about 
12.20 
a.m. 
On 
receiving 
information 
we 
proceeded to the place of occurrence but in the 
way we were informed that the dead body was 
shifted to the dead house. It is correct that it is 
written in my examination in chief: I proceeded 
to the place of occurrence first: then I went to the 
hospital. The factum of going to their hospital is 
correct and the factum of going to the place of 
occurrence is incorrect.” 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019

Gulzar Ahmad S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer deposed that he 
reached the dead house and sent the dead body to the mortuary for postmortem 
examination after preparing all the necessary documents. It is worth noticing in 
this context that there is a statement in column No.3 of the inquest report (Ex. PR) 
that the "date and time of the discovery of information of death" was on 
"08.12.2014 at 10:08 p.m”. As per the first column of the inquest report (Ex. PR), 
relating to the place where death took place or from where dead body was 
recovered, it was mentioned as “Mayo Hospital Emergency Ward Dead House”. 
On the last page of the inquest report (Ex. PR), the place and the time, when the 
inquest report was prepared and the witnesses put their signatures were left blank. 
It is mentioned in column No.8 of the inquest report (Exh. PR) that the mouth was 
semi-opened. Muhammad Nadeem 8057/C (PW-10) deposed during examination-
in-chief that:- 
“Stated that on 09.12.2014, I was posted at P.S 
Shafiquabad Investigation wing. On the same day 
Ghulzar Ahmad SI handed over to me and Khan 
Muhammad 10927/C the body of deceased 
Robina Shoaib for conducting the postmortem 
examination.” 
 
 
The facts mentioned above reveal that FIR was recorded later on after 
due deliberations and consultation and was ante-timed. The postmortem report 
(Ex. PJ) reveals that complete documents were received on 09.12.2014 at 12:45 
pm. Dr. Mansoora Mirza, (PW-9) deposed in her examination-in-chief that:- 
“On 9.12.2014 when the dead body of Mst. 
Robina 
Bibi 
aged 
48 
years 
female 
w/o 
Muhammad Shoib r/o House No.1 Street No.7 
Ravi road, Lahore was brought by Khan 
Muhammad 
No.10927/C 
and 
Muhammad 
Nadeem No.8057/HC P.S. Shafiqueabad, Lahore 
at 11.20 p.m. It was identified by Sameer Ahmad, 
s/o Muhammad Shoib (s/o deceased), and Mian 
Shaukat Ali, s/o Muhammad Shafi (relative of the 
deceased). According to police paper the time of 
death was 10.08 p.m. dated 08.12.2014. Complete 
police papers were received on 09.12.2014 at 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019 
 
 
 
9
12.45 p.m. and the autopsy was conducted at 1.00 
p.m. on the same date.” 
During cross-examination, Dr. Mansoora Mirza (PW-9) deposed as under: - 
“There 
is 
standing 
instruction 
that 
P.M 
examination of a dead body is to be conducted as 
soon as the complete police papers were received. 
The police papers means that all the documents 
prepared by the police should be present at the 
time of conducting of postmortem. The time of 
death is mentioned in PMR is 08.12.2014 at 10.08 
p.m. The dead body was received in the 
department on 9.12.2014 at 11.20 p.m. The time 
which was written in the concerned documents 
was 11.20 p.m. dated 09.12.2014 while it was 
11.20 a.m. It is correct that the time which I 
stated today at 11.20 a.m. The delay of 12 to 24 
hours was occurred due to not receiving police 
papers. Again said that delay in conducting the 
P.M. 
examination 
was 
non-availability 
of 
complete police papers.” 
 
 
The circumstances discussed above throw a cloud of doubt about 
whether the FIR was recorded when it was alleged to have been lodged by the 
police. The duration given by the doctor between death and postmortem was 12 to 
24 hours. It suggests that the death took place between 01:00 a.m. on 09.12.2014 
and 01:00 p.m. on 08.12.2014. The matter can also be examined from another 
angle: Zeeshan Khalid (PW-5)-the complainant deposed during cross-examination 
that: - 
“We reached at hospital after the occurrence 
within 15/30 minutes. I reached at hospital at 
about 10.30 p.m. After reaching the hospital we 
remained in hospital for about 1-1/2 hour. From 
hospital we came to our house and then we 
reached police station with out eldest members. 
We reached police station at about 12.00 
midnight/12.15 a.m. Then we returned back to 
our house and met police on next day. Next day 
they handed over us a copy of FIR then we went 
to hospital. We remained in contact with police 
during this period.” 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019

This fact creates doubt in the prosecution case as well as on the 
credibility and truthfulness of the statements of Zeeshan Khalid (PW-5)-the 
complainant, Sameer Gul Sher (PW-6), and Waseem Zafar (PW-7). Therefore, I 
do not think it safe to rely on the testimonies of these witnesses. This also creates 
doubt about the genuineness of the version given by prosecution witnesses, i.e., 
Zeeshan Khalid (PW-5)-the complainant, Sameer Gul Sher (PW-6), and Waseem 
Zafar (PW-7). Admittedly, all the witnesses are interested. Waseem Zafar (PW-7)-
the eye witness deposed during examination-in-chief that: - 
“Stated that on 08.12.2014 at about 10.00 p.m. I 
was eating meal in my room after finishing my 
work. I heard noise from outside in the street and 
saw that Asif and Hamza exchanging hot words 
with mother of Sameer.” 
 
 
Whereas, during cross-examination, the defence has brought 
improvements made by Waseem Zafar (PW-7)-the eye witness in his earlier 
statement on the record, which is as under: - 
“It is incorrect to suggest that I got recorded 
before the police that I was sleeping at the time of 
occurrence. Confronted with Ex.DA where so 
recorded.” 
 
 
Zeeshan Khalid (PW-5)-the complainant in the application for 
registration of case (Ex. PA), has mentioned that Waseem Zafar is the neighbor, 
who had also attracted to the place of occurrence. Whereas, during cross-
examination, he (PW-5)-the complainant, deposed about the relationship of the 
witnesses, which reads as under: - 
“Sameer is my brother-in-law. Waseem is my 
relative 
from 
my 
paternal 
father-in-law 
(Phopha).” 
 
 
 
 
 
Zeeshan Khalid (PW-5)-the complainant in his examination-in-chief, 
deposed that he was present at his house on 08.12.2014; at about 10:00 p.m., the 
door was knocked, and he opened the door and saw Hamza and Asif standing 
outside the door. Later, his mother-in-law came there, and they started 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019 
 
 
 
11
negotiations regarding land. During this episode, hot words were exchanged, and 
Sameer Shoaib (PW-6), son of the deceased, and Waseem Zafar (PW-7) also came 
there. Whereas, Sameer Gul Sher (PW-6) deposed in his examination-in-chief that 
on 08.12.2014 at about 10:00 p.m., a noise came from the street; he (PW-6) came 
down and saw that hot words were being exchanged in between his mother and 
Hamza (co-accused since acquitted) and Asif Ashfaq (the appellant) regarding 
land and on the refusal of his mother, the accused flared up and Asif (the 
appellant) made a fire shot upon his mother and she fell; Waseem his neighbor 
and Zeshan his brother in law also came there and attended his mother. The mode 
and manner of initiating the incident and who reached the place of occurrence also 
create doubt from the depositions mentioned above of the prosecution witnesses, 
i.e., Zeeshan Khalid (PW-5)-the complainant, Sameer Gul Sher (PW-6) and 
Waseem Zafar (PW-7). All the above facts, coupled with the fact that the 
prosecution has not provided evidence to establish the motive for the commission 
of a crime, create doubt about the prosecution case. It is admitted that the 
prosecution has not brought any proof on the record that Mst. Robina Shoaib, the 
deceased, is a shareholder in the land situated in Mehmood Booti, which also 
throws a cloud of doubt on the prosecution case.  
10. 
 
As regards the recovery of the 30-bore pistol P-5 and three live 
bullets (P-6/1-3), the only incriminating evidence on the disclosure and pointing 
of the appellant-Muhammad Asif and positive report of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore (Exh.P2) is concerned, it is a prosecution case that on 08.12.2014, 
Gulzar Ahmad S.I. (PW-8)-the investigating officer, collected one crime empty 
from the place of occurrence through recovery memo (Ex. PC). The same was 
handed over to the Moharrar malkhana on the same day. Atta ur Rehman 
13916/HC (PW-13)-Moharrar malkhana deposed during examination-in-chief that 
Gulzar Ahmad S.I. (PW-8) handed him two sealed parcels stamped with the logo 
of AS for safe custody. On 17.12.2014, he handed over the two sealed parcels to 
Khan Muhammad 10927/C (PW-4) for onward transmission to the office of 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. Khan Muhammad 10927/C (PW-4) 
deposed in his examination-in-chief that: - 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019 
 
 
 
12
“On 17.12.2014 two parcels one of blood stain 
and other of empties were handed over to me by 
moharrar operation P.S. Shafiqueabad which I 
took to the office of FSL. The parcel could not be 
deposited on the said date as objected by the 
office. I brought back the said parcel and handed 
it over to moharrar P.S. Shafiqueabad who again 
handed over to me the said parcel on 22.12.2014 
which I delivered in the FSL intact.” 
 
 
Atta ur Rehman 13916/H.C. (PW-13) deposed in his examination-in-
chief that on 17.12.2014, he handed over two parcels to Khan Muhammad 
10927/C (PW-4), which has been received back due to objection raised by the 
office of PFSA and on 22.12.2014, again said parcels were handed over to Khan 
Muhammad 10927/C (PW-4) for onward transmission and he (PW-4) deposited 
the same in the office of PFSA. Atta ur Rehman 13916/HC (PW-13) brought notes 
while recording his examination-in-chief. This fact has come on the record in his 
cross-examination, which reads as follows: - 
“It is correct that there are some notes on my left 
hand to refresh my knowledge. Volunteered that 
those are pertaining to some other case. Then 
said that these are pertaining to refresh 
memories of this case.” 
 
 
Atta ur Rehman 13916/HC (PW-13) gave his deposition during his 
examination-in-chief, with the help of notes he prepared for the purpose. Now, the 
question is whether his testimony can be treated as testimony by the provisions 
contained in Article 71 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. The tenor of the 
language used in the first proviso to Article 71 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 leads this court to the conclusion that evidence contemplated under Article 
71 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 envisages personal testimony based on 
the memory of the person who has seen, heard, or perceived a fact. The statement 
given on oath with the help of notes prepared by Atta ur Rehman 13916/HC (PW-
13) appears to be against the law on the subject. In this background, I, after going 
through the nature of the deposition, conclude that Atta ur Rehman 13916/HC 
(PW-13) is a witness to the fact that he handed over two parcels on 17.12.2014 to 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019 
 
 
 
13
Khan Muhammad 10927/C (PW-4) one of the blood stains and another of crime 
empties for onward transmission to PFSA but he (PW-4) could not deposit it with 
PFSA on the same day. He returned the same to Atta ur Rehman 13916/HC (PW-
13) Moharrar Malkhana, and later on 22.12.2014, Khan Muhammad 10927/C 
(PW-4) received parcels from Khan Muhammad 10927/C (PW-4) and deposited 
the same with the office of PFSA. To consider whether a witness is entitled to 
refresh his memory before or during his examination. Provisions contained in 
Article 155 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 are quoted below: 
155. Refreshing memory. 
(1) 
A witness may, while under examination, 
refresh his memory by referring to any writing 
made by himself at the time of the transaction 
concerning which he is questioned, or so soon 
afterwards that the Court considers it likely that the 
transaction was at that time fresh in his memory. 
(2) 
The witness may also refer to any such 
writing made by any other person, and read by the 
witness within the time aforesaid, if when he read 
it he knew it to be correct. 
(3) 
Whenever a witness may refresh his 
memory by reference to any document, he may, 
with the permission of the Court, refer to a copy of 
such document. 
Provided the Court be satisfied that there is 
sufficient reason for the non-production of the 
original. 
(4) 
An expert may refresh his memory by 
reference to professional treaties." 
 
 
In the instant case, no evidence has been given that this witness made 
entries in the Register No.19 kept for the purpose of the malkhana. Atta ur 
Rehman 13916/HC (PW-13) deposed that his statement under section 161 of 
Cr.P.C. was recorded by the investigating officer. Gulzar Ahmad S.I. (PW-8)-the 
investigating officer deposed during examination-in-chief that: -   

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019 
 
 
 
14
“On 17.12.2014, I recorded the statement of 
Khan Muhammad/C u/s 161 Cr.P.C. On 
18.01.2015 I arrested the accused Iftikhar alias 
Veera and sent to the judicial lock up by the 
Area Magistrate. I got challaned the accused on 
29.01.2015 by SHO concerned.” 
 
 
So, from the above deposition of Gulzar Ahmad S.I. (PW-8)-the 
investigating officer, it reveals he did not depose a single word that he recorded 
statement under section 161 of Cr.P.C. of Atta ur Rehman 13916/HC (PW-13) on 
17.12.2014 to the effect that Khan Muhammad 10927/C (PW-4) returned from 
PFSA and handed over the parcels to Atta ur Rehman 13916/HC (PW-13), who 
kept the same in safe custody, nor he deposed that on 22.12.2014 he recorded 
statements of Khan Muhammad 10927/C (PW-4) and Atta ur Rehman 13916/HC 
(PW-13) revealing that Atta ur Rehman 13916/HC (PW-13) handed over parcels 
to Khan Muhammad 10927/C (PW-4) and Khan Muhammad 10927/C (PW-4) 
deposited the same with PFSA. It is also necessary that when case property is re-
deposited in the Mallkhana, entry in the Malkhana Register is required to be 
made, and a dire necessity has been cast upon the prosecution to produce in Court 
the abstract of the Malkhana Register for ensuring, dispelling of, any aura of 
skepticism seeping into the prosecution case, especially vis-a-vis safe custody of 
the case property (P-7), "being," re-deposited in the Malkhana. Therefore, in the 
present case, provisions of Article 155 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
would have no application. Pointing out the above deposition of prosecution 
witnesses it reveals that the prosecution did not prove that the parcel of the crime 
empty (P-7) was kept in safe custody. Due to the lack of this evidence, it cannot 
be held that the alleged parcel of crime empty (P-7) was re-deposited in 
Malkhana, and its benefit will go to the accused. This creates doubt about the 
genuineness and safe custody of the crime empty (P-7) recovered from the place 
of occurrence. It is also the prosecution case that the appellant-Muhammad Asif, 
was arrested by Abbas S.I., Incharge Investigation P.S. Lower Mall, on 
14.05.2016, and he informed Ghulam Muhammad S.I. (PW-17)-investigating 
officer, about the arrest of the appellant and he (PW-17) took custody of 
Muhammad Asif-the appellant from P.S. Lower Mall, Lahore and after that 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019 
 
 
 
15
Ghulam Muhammad S.I. (PW-17)-the investigating officer produced Muhammad 
Asif-the appellant before the Magistrate and took his physical remand. Ghulam 
Muhammad S.I. (PW-17)-the investigating officer deposed during examination-
in-chief that: - 
“On 27.05.2016 accused made a disclosure during 
investigation that he could get recovered the 
pistol P5 which used in the occurrence. I reached 
at graveyard Gao Shala on lead of accused upon 
reaching there I opened one hand-cuff of the 
accused and accused with his free hand got 
recovered pistol P-5 from the western side wall of 
the graveyard by digging the earth which was 
wrapped in a polythene envelope. Upon unload 
three live bullets P-6/1-3 were recovered. -------- 
After reaching police station I handed over 
parcel to moharrar for keeping it in safe custody. 
--------------- On 08.06.2016 I recorded statement 
of moharrar regarding safe custody of case 
property. The parcels of case property of this 
case was submitted in the office of PFSA by me.” 
 
 
It is the case of the prosecution that pistol P-5, alongwith three live 
bullets P-6/1-3, were recovered from the possession of the appellant. Ghulam 
Muhammad S.I. (PW-17)-the investigating officer prepared sealed parcels and 
took them into possession through a recovery memo (Ex. PM). After that, on 
reaching the police station, he (PW-17) handed it over to moharrar malkhana. Atta 
ur Rehman 13916/HC (PW-13) deposed during examination-in-chief that on 
09.12.2016 (Urdu version of this witness reveals that he was posted on 
09.12.2016) he was posted at the police station Shafiqabad as moharrar. He (PW-
13) deposed about the sealed parcels handed over to him by Gulzar Ahmad S.I. on 
09.12.2016 and handed over the parcels to Khan Muhammad 10927/C (PW-4) on 
17.12.2014 and 22.12.2014. However, Atta ur Rehman 13916/HC (PW-13) did 
not state a single word that sealed parcels of pistol P-5, alongwith three live 
bullets P-6/1-3 were handed over to him (PW-13) by Ghulam Muhammad S.I. 
(PW-17)-the investigating officer. Ghulam Muhammad S.I. (PW-17)-the 
investigating officer also did not state a single word that when he received a 
sealed parcel of pistol P-5 and submitted the same with the office of PFSA. The 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019 
 
 
 
16
prosecution has to establish by convincing evidence that the alleged parcels of 
pistol (P-5), alongwith three live bullets (P-6/1-3) and crime empty (P-7), were 
kept in safe custody. There is no explanation for this failure to establish safe 
custody of the parcels pistol (P-5), alongwith three live bullets (P-6/1-3) from the 
time of seizer on 27-05-2016 till its deposit with the Moharrar and after that its 
production before court. It is not clear where the parcels of pistol (P-5), alongwith 
three live bullets (P-6/1-3), were kept. The prosecution has to establish by 
convincing evidence that the alleged parcels of pistol (P-5), alongwith three live 
bullets (P-6/1-3), were the same, recovered at the pointing of the appellant and 
were kept in safe custody. There is no explanation for this failure to establish safe 
custody of the pistol (P-5), alongwith three live bullets (P-6/1-3) from the time of 
the seizer on 27-05-2016 till its production in the court. Mere oral evidence of the 
prosecution witnesses, i.e., Ghulam Muhammad S.I. (PW-17)-the investigating 
officer, Khurram Shahzad 12228/C (PW-14), and Amir Sarwar 14166/C (PW-15) 
as to the recovery of pistol (P-5), alongwith three live bullets (P-6/1-3) does not 
discharge the heavy burden of responsibility, which lies on the prosecution. It is 
the considered opinion of the court that the inconsistencies described above and 
contradictions considered cumulatively do lead to irresistible influence that the 
prosecution has not been able to prove safe custody of the parcels of pistol (P-5), 
alongwith three live bullets (P-6/1-3) recovered from the possession of the 
accused-appellant through material and cogent evidence. This contradiction went 
to the root of the case. Thus, there is no evidence to connect the Firearms & 
Toolmarks Examination Report (Ex. PZ) with the substance seized from the 
possession of the appellant. I am, therefore, of the view that the recovery of 30-
bore pistol P-5 and three live bullets (P6/1-3) and the positive report of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. P2) are of no avail to the prosecution.  
11. 
 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General emphasized that after the 
occurrence, the appellant absconded himself. However, in the light of the 
statement of Ghulam Muhammad S.I. (PW-17)-the investigating officer, and 
Shaukat Ali 7206/C (PW-18), it could not be said that the requirements of 
declaring a person-proclaimed offender were met. Ghulam Muhammad S.I. (PW-

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019

17)-the investigating officer deposed during examination-in-chief that, "On 
28.04.2015 I was posted at P.S. Shafiqueabad, Lahore. On the same day 
investigation of this case was entrusted to me. After examining the record I 
found that the previous I.O had obtained proclamations of accused persons 
namely Muhammad Asif, Muhammad Ashfaq and Hamza Ashfaq. On 
29.04.2015 I recorded statements of constable Shaukat Ali regarding 
proclamation. On 05.02.2015 I submitted report u/s 512 Cr.P.C to the court 
through proper channel." He (PW-17) also deposed during cross-examination 
that, “I recorded the statement of Shaukat constable u/s 161 Cr.P.C. on 
29.04.2016. He got recorded his statement pertaining to arrest warrant and 
proclamation of the accused. He did not get recorded his statement about 
beat of drum and announcement in the mosque of the vicinity. Shaukat 
constable did not record statement of any private person from the locality.” 
Contrary to the deposition of Ghulam Muhammad S.I. (PW-17)-the investigating 
officer, Gulzar Ahmad S.I. (PW-8) did not depose a single word that he got issued 
non-bailable warrant of arrest and proclamation against the appellant. It is also 
admitted that Shaukat Ali 7206/C (PW-18) had not stated that when non-bailable 
warrant of arrest and proclamation was issued and handed over to him. Shaukat 
Ali 7206/C (PW-18) deposed during cross-examination that "I do not remember 
the dates when I was entrusted proclamations. In order to trace out the 
accused I went to Jamshaid town, Bhaini road near Mahmood Booti 
Baghbanpura, Lahore. The proclamations were fixed on different places at 
their houses. I did not record statement of any person on the back of 
proclamation. I did not meet any councilor or Numberdar etc. I did not cause 
announcement in the mosque. I did not make any announcement through 
drum beat." However, the factum of absconding, even if established, could only 
be used as corroborative evidence and was not a substantive piece of evidence. It 
is an established principle of law that mere absconsion is not proof of the guilt of 
an accused. Reliance is placed on “Rasool Muhammad v. Asal Muhammad and 
another” (PLJ 1995 SC 477).  From the above, it can be ascertained that the 

Crl. Appeal No. 6732-J of 2019 
 
 
 
18
prosecution failed to bring the appellant's guilt through straightforward, 
confidence-inspiring, and corroborative evidence. 
12. 
 
From the facts and circumstances narrated above, I am persuaded 
that the prosecution could not prove its case against the accused beyond the 
shadow of a doubt, as there were many dents in the prosecution story. The 
accused persons are not expected to prove their innocence to the hilt. If the 
prosecution story is doubtful, the benefit of the doubt must go to the accused-
appellant. Against this backdrop, it can safely be held that the prosecution has 
badly failed to bring home the guilt of the accused/appellant, and the conviction 
passed by the trial court in the circumstances is against all canons of law 
recognized for the dispensation of criminal justice.  Per the dictates of the law, the 
benefit of every doubt will be extended in favor of the accused/appellant. The 
conviction and sentence the trial court recorded cannot be sustained.  Reliance has 
been placed on the case reported as Muhammad Akram   v.  The State (2009 
SCMR 230), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan had held that even a 
single circumstance creating reasonable doubts in a prudent mind about the guilt 
of the accused makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a matter of grace and 
concession, but as a matter of right.  
13. 
 
As a result, Criminal Appeal No.6732-J of 2019 is accepted into toto.  
Conviction and sentence recorded by the trial court vide judgment dated 
27.11.2018 is set aside as a consequence of which, Muhammad Asif, son of 
Muhammad Ashfaq-the appellant, is ordered to be acquitted of the charge in 
case FIR No.1086/2014 dated 09.12.2014 registered under sections 302, 34 PPC 
at P.S. Shafiqabad, District Lahore. The appellant, Muhammad Asif, son of 
Muhammad Ashfaq, is in jail. He (the appellant) is directed to be released 
forthwith if not required in any other case.
