Through this petition filed in terms of Article 199 of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the 
petitioner has made the following supplication: - 
 
“Under the above circumstance it is therefore, 
respectfully prayed that by accepting this writ petition, 
the impugned order No.DO/IPWM/BWP/437-38 dated 
29.10.2024 regarding sealing of lawful petrol pump of 
petitioner as well as order No.DO/IPWM/BWP/451 
dated 13.11.2024 passed by respondent No.3, whereby 
the petitioner has been imposed the penalty of 
Rs.10,00,000/- (One Million) U/S 44 of the Pakistan 
Petroleum (Refining, Blending and Marketing) Rules 
1971 and the respondent No.7 is directed to recover fine 
from petitioner within two days, in case of non-payment 
of fine within stipulated time the petitioner will be 
sentenced to one year imprisonment, hence both 
impugned orders may kindly be set-aside and declare as 
illegal, against the law, without lawful authority having 
no legal effect and in operative upon the rights of the 
petitioner and the appellant may be exonerated from the 
charges and the petrol pump of the appellant may kindly 
be de-sealed in the interest of justice 
It is further prayed that the operation of impugned 
the impugned order No.DO/IPWM/BWP/437-38 dated 
29.10.2024 and 13.11.2024 passed by respondent No.3 
may kindly be suspended till the final decision of above 
titled writ petition.  
Any other consequential relief, which this 
Hon’able Court deems fit may also kindly be granted to 
the petitioner, in the interest of justice.”

2. 
On the first date of hearing i.e. 18.11.2024, report 
and parawise comments were called from respondents No.3 
and 4, subject to maintainability of the instant writ petition. 
In compliance of the above order of this Court, respondents 
No.3 and 4 have jointly submitted their report and parawise 
comments, which have already been made a part of the file.  
3. 
With regard to the maintainability of writ petition in 
hand, learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that 
since the impugned orders have been passed without any 
lawful authority, therefore, the petitioner is left with no 
alternate, efficacious and speedy remedy except to invoke 
the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court. So far as the 
merits of the case are concerned, he contended that the 
impugned orders have been passed on wrong premise of 
law and the same, being ultra vires, cannot sustain in the 
eye of law.  
4. 
On the other hand, learned Assistant Advocate 
General has supported the impugned orders and prayed for 
dismissal of writ petition on the point of maintainability 
with the assertion that the petitioner, if feels aggrieved of 
the impugned order, may avail the remedy of filing an 
appeal before the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority 
(OGRA).  
5. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as 
well as learned Assistant Advocate General assiduously and 
gone through the documents appended with the file of this 
writ petition. 
6. 
Before pondering upon the respective contentions of 
learned counsel for the petitioner as well as learned 
Assistant Advocate General in respect of maintainability of 
this writ petition, I would like to observe here that the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the 
“Constitution”) 
has 
provided 
safeguard 
to 
certain 
fundamental rights of every citizen of the country. Amongst 

W.P. No.9424 of 2024 
3
those, the right to freedom of trade, business or profession 
is guaranteed under Article 18 of the “Constitution”, which 
is reproduced as infra:- 
Freedom of trade, business or profession 
18. Subject to such qualifications, if any, as may be 
prescribed by law, every citizen shall have the right to 
enter upon any lawful profession or occupation, and to 
conduct any lawful trade or business: Provided that 
nothing in this Article shall prevent—  
(a) the regulation of any trade or profession by a 
licensing system; or  
(b) the regulation of trade, commerce or industry 
in the interest of free competition therein; or 
(c) the carrying on, by the Federal Government or 
a Provincial Government, or by a corporation 
controlled by any such Government, of any trade, 
business, industry or service, to the exclusion, 
complete or partial, of other persons. 
Article 199 of the “Constitution” empowers this 
Court to issue directions and pass appropriate orders for the 
protection of rights of any aggrieved party from violation at 
the hands of public functionaries, who have upper hand in 
affairs of the people and may misuse their power or 
authority vested in them. The nature and scope of the 
Constitutional jurisdiction of this Court has been 
extensively discussed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
the case of “Export Promotion Bureau and others vs. 
Qaiser Shafiullah” (1994 SCMR 859) in the following 
words:- 
“Constitutional jurisdiction is not designed and intended 
to be used as a substitute for a regular appeal or to be 
equated with a regular appeal. In a Constitutional 
petition the High Court cannot interfere with a finding of 
fact merely on the ground that the reasons which found 
favour with the Authority whose order is under scrutiny 
were not such which would have been accepted by the 
High Court. The Constitutional jurisdiction can be 
invoked to rectify jurisdictional defects. It is to be 
pressed into service against an order which is without 
jurisdiction or tainted with malice or is violative of a 
provision of the Constitution/Law and not to correct a 
finding of fact. However, even in Constitutional 
jurisdiction the High Court may interfere with a finding 

W.P. No.9424 of 2024 
4
of fact, if it is founded on no evidence or is contrary to 
the evidence.” 
In another case titled as “Dilawar Jan vs. Gul 
Rehman and 5 others” (PLD 2001 Supreme Court 149), 
Hon’ble Full Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan did 
not agree with the contention raised by learned counsel for 
the petitioner of said case that the High Court has 
transgressed its limits by striking down the order of the 
competent forum in exercise of jurisdiction as conferred 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan 1973 for the simple reason that “it is 
an omnibus Article under which relief can be granted to the 
citizens of the country against infringement of any 
provisions of law or the Constitution”. In this case-law, the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has further observed as under:-  
“We are conscious of the fact that the learned High 
Court in exercise of Constitutional jurisdiction cannot sit 
as a Court of appeal but where order passed by Court, 
suffers from any jurisdictional defect or violates any, 
provision of law, invocation of Constitutional jurisdiction 
would be justified and if the error is so glaring and 
patent that it may not be acceptable that in such an 
eventuality the High Courts have interfered when finding 
is based on insufficient evidence, misreading of evidence, 
non-consideration of material evidence, erroneous 
assumption of fact, patent errors of law, consideration of 
inadmissible evidence, excess or abuse of jurisdiction, 
arbitrary exercise of power and where unreasonable 
view on evidence has been taken, In this regard reliance 
can be placed on PLD 1978 Quetta 17 + (PLJ 1978 
Quetta 72(DB). "It is by now settled law that the High 
Courts in exercise of their Constitutional jurisdiction do 
not normally interfere with the finding on fact but if the 
decisions are based in disregard of the provisions of law, 
or, are based on misreading or insufficient or 
inadmissible 
evidence 
the 
superior 
Courts 
have 
interfered with such decisions and findings in order to 
advance the cause of justice. Reference may be made to 
(i) Nasreen Fatima v. Principal, Bolan Medical College 
PLD 1978 Quetta 17, (ii) Imtiaz Bashir v. Special High 
Powered Committee PLD 1978 Quetta 131, (iii) 
Haleema Bai v. Settlement Commissioner 1987 MLD 
3215. (Ali Nawaz v. Member, Board of Revenue PLD 
1989 Kar. 237). The said view also finds support from 
the following authorities:-- 
(i) 
Saeeda Fatima v. Abdul Hamid PLD 1983 SC 
258; 

W.P. No.9424 of 2024 
5
(ii) 
Gulzar Ahmad v. State PLD 1985 Lah. 353; 
(iii) 
Ahmeden Bibi v. Rustam Ali PLD 1989 Lah. 531 
(iv) 
Abdul Aziz v. Bashir Ahmad 1989 CLC 103 
7. There is no cavil to the proposition that failure on the 
part of a statutory functionary or a Court to make a 
visible effort with diligent application of mind to 
adjective assertion or to strive in search of truth for 
dispensing justice would tantamount to failure to 
exercise jurisdiction in the eye of law. …………………” 
 
There is no cavil to the proposition that writ petition 
under Article 199 of the “Constitution” is only competent 
when no alternate or efficacious remedy is provided under 
the law. Wisdom behind this scheme of law is that where a 
specific remedy is provided, the aggrieved person is 
normally encouraged to avail such remedy instead of 
invoking writ jurisdiction of this Court. The availability of 
an alternative adequate and effective remedy, however, 
would not impair the High Court's authority to consider a 
constitutional 
petition 
under 
Article 
199 
of 
the 
"Constitution," where the sole question for decision-making 
is whether the Court's discretion should be used in a given 
case under the relevant circumstances. Reliance is placed 
on the case-law reported as “Government of Punjab 
through Minster for Revenue, Board of Revenue, Lahore 
and others vs. Messrs Crescent Textile Mills Limited” 
(PLD 2004 Supreme Court 108). Further guidance can 
also be sought from a recent pronouncement of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case-law titled as 
“Muhammad Safeer and others vs. Muhammad Azam and 
others” (PLD 2024 Supreme Court 838), wherein it has 
been held as under:- 
“4. We have noted that the High Court, without 
adverting to the grounds expressly taken by the 
petitioners in their petition, concluded that the remedy 
by way of review provided under section 8 of the Act of 
1957 was adequate and efficacious for the purposes of 
entertaining the petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution. It is settled law that the rule that the High 
Court will not ordinarily entertain a petition under 
Article 199 when an adequate remedy is available and 

W.P. No.9424 of 2024 
6
such 
remedy 
only 
regulates 
the 
exercise 
of 
constitutional jurisdiction and does not affect its 
existence. When the law provides an adequate remedy, 
constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 will 
ordinarily 
only 
be 
exercised 
in 
exceptional 
circumstances. The exceptional circumstances which 
may justify exercising jurisdiction when an adequate 
remedy is available are when the order or action 
assailed before the High Court is palpably without 
jurisdiction, manifestly mala fide, void or coram non 
judice. The tendency to bypass a statutory remedy is 
ordinarily discouraged so that the legislative intent is 
not defeated. The High Court, while exercising its 
discretion, must take into consideration the facts and 
circumstances in each case in order to determine 
whether the remedy provided under the statute is 
illusory or not. These principles have been consistently 
highlighted by this Court.” 
In simple words, writ jurisdiction is to be pressed 
into service against an order, which is without jurisdiction 
or tainted with malice or is in violation of the provisions of 
Constitution or law and also to rectify the jurisdictional 
defects qua the functions in connection with the affairs of 
the State authorities. For reference, Article 199(1)(a) of the 
“Constitution” is reproduced hereunder:- 
“Jurisdiction of High Court 199. (1) Subject to the 
Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied that no 
other adequate remedy is provided by law,—  
(a) on the application of any aggrieved party, 
make an order—  
(i) directing a person performing, within 
the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, 
functions in connection with the affairs of 
the Federation, a Province or a local 
authority, to refrain from doing anything 
he is not permitted by law to do, or to do 
anything he is required by law to do; or  
(ii) declaring that any act done or 
proceeding taken within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the Court by a person 
performing functions in connection with the 
affairs of the Federation, a Province or a 
local authority has been done or taken 
without lawful authority and is of no legal 
effect;  
7. 
Now adverting to the proposition in the present case, 
it is the stance of respondent No.3 (Deputy Commissioner, 

W.P. No.9424 of 2024 
7
Bahawalpur) that under Rule 43A of the Pakistan 
Petroleum (Refining, Blending and Marketing) Rules, 1971 
(the “Rules of 1971”), he has been designated to exercise 
any power or perform any function as is to be exercised or 
performed by the Director General Oil or OGRA and in 
such scenario, he has passed the impugned orders in 
accordance with the provision of Rule 44 of the “Rules of 
1971”. Learned Assistant Advocate General, while 
endorsing the stance of respondent No.3, has added that a 
remedy of filing appeal against the impugned orders has 
been provided under the law, for the reason, same cannot 
be set aside in writ jurisdiction, however, he remained 
unable to point out any specific provision in the “Rules of 
1971” to substantiate his contention that a remedy of filing 
appeal against the impugned orders is available to the 
petitioner. At fag-end, he has pointed out that the appeal 
can be filed under section 12 of the Oil and Gas Regulatory 
Authority Ordinance, 2002 (the “Ordinance of 2002”), but 
he could not controvert that such an appeal is provided 
against the order or decision of the delegatee of a power 
delegated by the Authority under section 10 of the 
“Ordinance of 2002” which is not the issue involved in the 
present case, according to which respondent No.3 has 
passed the impugned orders under Rule 44 of the “Rules of 
1971” and not in pursuance of delegation of powers under 
section 10 of the “Ordinance of 2002”. 
Besides, it is noteworthy that the “Rules of 1971” 
were formulated by the then Federal Government in 
exercise of the powers conferred by section 2 of the 
Regulation of Mines and Oil-Fields and Mineral 
Development (Government Control) Act, 1948 read with 
section 3 thereof, but with the passage of time, law has 
developed in our country and the rules relating thereto have 
been refurbished through the Pakistan Oil (Refining, 

W.P. No.9424 of 2024 
8
Blending, Transportation, Storage and Marketing) Rules, 
2016 (the “Rules of 2016), which have been made by the 
Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, with the approval of the 
Federal Government, in exercise of the powers conferred 
by section 41 of the “Ordinance of 2002”. As the “Rules of 
2016” have been given overriding effect upon the “Rules of 
1971”, therefore, everything had to be done by the 
concerned authority in pursuance of the “Rules of 2016” as 
well as the “Ordinance of 2002”.  
Being so, the question has become very simple that 
whether respondent No.3 had been vested with any power 
to pass the impugned orders within the scope of “Rules of 
2016” or the “Ordinance of 2002”. To resolve this 
controversy, I have to refer the definition of term 
“Authority”, which was previously set out in Rule 2(b) of 
the “Rules of 1971” as under:- 
“Definitions.- In these rules, unless there is anything 
Repugnant in the subject or context,- 
(a) …………………………………………….. 
(b) “AUTHORITY” in relation to,- 
(i) rules 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11A, 13, 20, 22, 30, 
30A, 30B, 31, 33A, 39 and 43C means the 
Director General Oil; 
(ii) rules 16, 16B, 17, 18, 26, 27, 28, 33, 35, 
36, 38, 40, 41, 41A and 43 means the Oil 
and Gas Regulatory Authority; and  
(iii) rules 14, 24, 32, 34 and 42 means both 
Director General Oil and the Oil and Gas 
Regulatory Authority; 
 
In view of Rule 43A of the “Rules of 1971”, the 
District Coordination of the district may have exercised 
certain powers relating to rules 34, 35, 36, 38 and 43, which 
otherwise had to be exercised by the Director General Oil 
and the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority in view of Rule 
2(b) of the “Rules of 1971”. But after promulgation of the 
Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002, the 
definition of “Authority” has been substituted as “Oil and 
Gas Regulatory Authority established under section 3 of the 

W.P. No.9424 of 2024 
9
“Ordinance of 2002”. In this regard, section 2(1)(i) of the 
“Ordinance of 2002” reads as infra: - 
“Definitions.--- (1) In this Ordinance, unless there is 
anything repugnant in the subject or context,--- 
(a) “Authority” 
means 
the 
Oil 
and 
Gas 
Regulatory Authority established under section 
3;” 
 
Section 44(3)(a) of the “Ordinance of 2002”, is also 
quite relevant qua the definition of term “Authority”, which 
is reproduced as under: - 
“44. Repeal and savings.-  
(1) ……………………………………………………… 
(2) ……………………………………………………… 
(3) (a) The definition for “Authority” set out in 
the rules referred to in clause (b) shall be 
substituted 
by 
the 
following 
definition, 
namely:--- 
“Authority” means the Oil and Gas Regulatory 
Authority established pursuant to the Oil and 
Gas Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002”; 
(b) the substitution referred to in clause (a) shall 
apply to the following rules, namely:- 
(i) the Pakistan Petroleum (Refining, Blending 
and Marketing Rules, 1971;  
(ii) the Compressed Natural Gas (Production 
and Marketing) Rules, 1992; and  
(iii) the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Production 
and Distribution) Rules, 2001; and 
 
At this stage, I would also like to refer here section 
10(1) of the “Ordinance of 2002”, which deals with the 
delegation of powers, and the same is reproduced as under:- 
“Delegation of powers.- (1) The Authority may, by 
general or special order, delegate to any officer of the 
Authority the power to exercise on behalf of the Authority 
any of its powers, duties or functions under this 
Ordinance subject to such conditions as it may think fit 
to impose.” 
 
Keeping in view the above-noted provisions of law, 
learned Assistant Advocate General has been asked time 
and again to produce any order of the authority i.e. “the Oil 
and Gas Regulatory Authority” through which any powers 
exercisable in pursuance of the “Ordinance of 2002” and 
the “Rules of 2016”, have been delegated to respondent 

W.P. No.9424 of 2024 
10
No.3 (Deputy Commissioner, Bahawalpur) and in response, 
he has apprised the Court that no such order regarding 
delegation of powers to respondent No.3 has been issued by 
the “Authority”. In this way, I am of the firm view that 
respondent No.3 (Deputy Commissioner, Bahawalpur) or 
any officer subordinate to him, unless and until specifically 
delegated powers under the “Ordinance of 2002” and the 
“Rules of 2016” were not competent to act being the 
Inspecting Officer(s).  
 
To fortify my above view, I deem it appropriate to 
refer here section 44(3)(c) of the “Ordinance of 2002” 
which envisages that the “Rules of 1971” shall stand 
repealed to the extent that any rules promulgated pursuant 
to this Ordinance provide for the matter relating to refining 
and blending of petroleum, in the case of the “Rules of 
1971”, which could remain operative only to the extent 
they are not inconsistent with the “Rules of 2016”. Since an 
explicit procedural and enforcement mechanism has been 
mentioned in Rules 54 and 55 of the “Rules of 2016”, 
superseding similar provisions under the “Rules of 1971”, 
so the “Rules of 2016” have to be followed in such 
circumstances, therefore, the acts which have been done as 
per the “Rules of 1971” have no legal backing. For the 
purpose of clarity, Rules 54 and 55 of the “Rules of 2016” 
are reproduced hereunder:- 
 “54. Entry and inspection.--- (1) Any person including 
any District Coordination Officer authorized in writing 
by the Authority 
(hereinafter called 
“Inspection 
Officer”) may at any reasonable time ---  
(a) enter, inspect and examine any premises, 
facility or installations, owned or operated by 
an oil marketing company, refinery, blending 
plant, reclamation plant or grease plant; 
(b) take sample free of any charge or check 
specifications of oil, produced locally or 
imported, and for the time being in the 
possession, custody or control of a person 
engaged in any regulated activity; and  
(c) make such examination or inquiry, as he 
considers necessary, for ensuring that the 

W.P. No.9424 of 2024 
11
provisions of these rules, or any order made 
thereunder are being fully observed. 
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-rule (1), all 
members of the Authority shall be deemed to have the 
authorization and powers of Inspection Officer.” 
“55. Authorization of the Authority.--- (1) The 
Inspection Officer may further check and satisfy himself 
that the provisions of the Ordinance and these rules and 
the decisions made by the Authority are complied with in 
letter and spirit by all and sundry, provided that such 
Inspection Officer may take any action in accordance 
with the Ordinance and these rules and the decisions 
made by the Authority, in emergency and on the spot, if 
he considers such action on his part is necessary and 
thereafter report forthwith to the Chairman and as soon 
as possible necessary and thereafter report forthwith to 
the Chairman and as soon as possible to the Authority 
for ratification unless the Chairman issues appropriate 
orders or directions or does not consider it necessary to 
submit the matter to the Authority.” 
From the above, it is abundantly clear that the 
District Coordination Officer or, as the case may be, the 
Deputy Commissioner does not have any power, except on 
the basis of an authorization in writing by the “Authority”, 
to act being an Inspection Officer. However, it has been 
frankly conceded by learned Assistant Advocate General 
that no such authorization in writing had been given by the 
“Authority” to respondent No.3 (Deputy Commissioner, 
Bahawalpur), therefore, no doubt is left in my mind that his 
actions qua the passing of impugned orders in respect of 
sealing the business premises of the petitioner as well as 
imposing fine upon him are ultra vires. In the given state of 
affairs, it can be further observed here that the petitioner 
has rightly pressed into service the writ jurisdiction of this 
Court against the impugned orders, which are not only 
without jurisdiction but also are in violation of the 
provisions of the “Ordinance of 2002” as well as the rules 
made thereunder i.e. the “Rules of 2016”.  
8. 
I am also mindful of the fact that through order 
No.DO/IPWM/BWP/437-38 dated 29.10.2024, respondent 
No.3 has directed the Assistant Commissioners concerned 

W.P. No.9424 of 2024 
12
to immediately seal the business premises of the petitioner 
M/s Khan Petroleum Service as well as M/s Hamza Hassan 
Petroleum Service while exercising powers under Rule 44 
of the “Rules of 1971”, but no such power is vested with 
him in the aforesaid Rule. In a similar way, respondent 
No.3 has imposed the penalty of Rs.10,00,000/- (One 
Million) upon the petitioner M/s Khan Petroleum Service 
through order No.DO/IPWM/BWP/451 dated 13.11.2024, 
under Rule 44 of the “Rules of 1971”, payable within two 
days or in default thereof the owner/manager of M/s Khan 
Petroleum Service will undergo one year imprisonment, but 
here again no such penalty is provided in the above 
mentioned Rule. For the guidance of respondent No.3 and 
all other concerned, Rule 44 of the “Rules of 1971” is 
reproduced as infra:- 
“44. Penalty for breach of rules.- Any person who 
contravenes the provisions of any of these rules shall, 
without prejudice to any other action that may be taken 
under these rules in relation to the contravention, be 
punishable for every breach with imprisonment for a 
term which may extend to three years, or with five (which 
shall not be less than fifteen thousand rupees) or with 
both.”   
Now the penalties with regard to contravention of 
any provision or rule are provided in Rule 69, Chapter-XI 
of the “Rules of 2016”, which reads as infra: - 
 
 “69. Penalty.--- (1) Subject to sub-rule (2), a person, 
who contravenes any provision of the Ordinance, these 
rules, terms and conditions of the license, or the 
decisions of the Authority shall be punishable with fine 
which may extend to ten million rupees and in case of a 
continuing contravention with a further fine which may 
extend to one million rupees for every day during which 
such contravention continues. 
(2) In imposing any fine under these rules, the 
Authority shall keep in view the principle of 
proportionality of the fine to the gravity of the 
contravention. Prior to imposing the fine, the Authority 
shall, in writing, require the person liable to be affected 
to show cause in writing as to why the fine may not be 
imposed.”   

W.P. No.9424 of 2024 
13
Through Notification No.OGRA-12(07)/2020-SBR 
dated 14.05.2020, imposition of penalty on Oil Marketing 
Companies (OMC) due to overcharging, less filling and 
quality failure at retail outlets has been approved by the 
Authority, whereby maximum amount of penalty on an 
OMC upon violations observed at one outlet per inspection 
has been fixed @ Rs.1.000 Million.  
When Rules 55 and 69(2) of the “Rules of 2016” are 
read together, it becomes easier to understand that after 
authorization in writing being an Inspection Officer in 
terms of Rule 54 of the “Rules of 2016”, respondent No.3 
still has no independent power to impose penalties under 
the “Ordinance of 2002” or the “Rules of 2016” rather he is 
only obliged to submit a report to the “Chairman” and the 
“Authority” as referred in section 3 of the “Ordinance of 
2002” and it is left with the “Authority” that it shall require 
the person liable to be affected, to show cause in writing as 
to why the fine may not be imposed, prior to imposing fine 
upon him, the quantum of which is also prescribed in Rule 
69 of the “Rules of 2016” as well as Notification 
No.OGRA-12(07)/2020-SBR dated 14.05.2020. 
9. 
Last but not the least, it is a sorry state of affairs that 
respondent No.3 has passed the impugned 
order 
No.DO/IPWM/BWP/451 dated 13.11.2024 while carrying 
the proceedings in a manner of summary trial, whereby he 
imposed the penalty of Rs.10,00,000/- (One Million) upon 
the petitioner M/s Khan Petroleum Service, to be paid 
within two days or in default thereof the owner/manager of 
M/s Khan Petroleum Service has to undergo one year 
imprisonment, but respondent No.3 has completely ignored 
the relevant provisions given in Chapter-XXII of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure (Act V of 1898) while conducting 
summary trial, in the light of which the penalty of 
Rs.10,00,000/- or imprisonment of one year in default 

W.P. No.9424 of 2024

thereof could not have been imposed by respondent No.3 
through summary trial of the petitioner. On this score as 
well, the impugned order resulting into imposition of fine 
of Rs.10,00,000/- (One Million) or imprisonment for a 
period of one year in default thereof is also clearly without 
jurisdiction. 
10. 
As an outcome of the above discussion, I hold that 
after promulgation of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority 
Ordinance, 2002 and making as well as approval of the 
Pakistan Oil (Refining, Blending, Transportation, Storage 
and Marketing) Rules, 2016, respondent No.3 being the 
Deputy Commissioner of Bahawalpur district was not 
authorized to seal the business premises of the petitioner or 
impose any penalty upon him in terms of Rule 44 of the 
Pakistan Petroleum (Refining, Blending and Marketing) 
Rules, 1971, as these rules have already been overridden by 
the provisions contained in the “Ordinance of 2002” as well 
as the “Rules of 2016”. Having held so and since no 
remedy is available to assail the impugned orders passed by 
respondent No.3 under Rule 44 of the “Rules of 1971”, the 
matter involves in this writ petition falls within the purview 
of Article 199(1)(a) of the “Constitution”, which aspect has 
made the instant writ petition fully competent and 
maintainable before this Court. It is also held that since the 
impugned orders i.e. order No.DO/IPWM/BWP/437-38 
dated 29.10.2024 and order No.DO/IPWM/BWP/451 dated 
13.11.2024 are ultra vires as have been passed by 
respondent No.3 without any lawful authority, hence, the 
same cannot sustain in the eye of law to the extent of 
present petitioner.  
11. 
Consequently, I accept this writ petition and set 
aside the impugned order No.DO/IPWM/BWP/437-38 
dated 29.10.2024 to the extent of present petitioner as well 

W.P. No.9424 of 2024
