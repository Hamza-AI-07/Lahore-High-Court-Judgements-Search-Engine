as all these applications canvass common questions of facts and law.  
2. 
The applicants herein are seeking transfer of execution 
petitions pending before different learned Family Courts in 
pursuance of decrees passed in the suits instituted under the Family 
Courts Act, 1964. The question for resolution before us is relatable 
to mode of transfer/entrustment of the execution petition in case 
where the judgment debtor does not reside or hold property in the 
territorial jurisdiction of the Family Court which passed the decree. 
3. 
We have noticed that matter under consideration was 
previously resolved by a learned Single Bench of this Court in Mian 
MUHAMMAD ARSHAD versus SABA GUL and 5 others (2022 MLD 1280) 
with the following observations :- 
“9. 
Resultantly, instant petition is allowed and impugned 
order dated 08.04.2021 and judgment dated 16.04.2021 are 
declared to be illegal and without lawful authority to the 
extent that whatever transfer has been made, and record sent 
to learned Executing Court at Faisalabad, same shall be 

T.A. No.31 of 2022 
 
-4- 
 
deemed to have been transferred under Section 25-A of the 
Act of 1964 by this Court today. Learned Executing Court at 
Faisalabad is directed to proceed in the matter for 
satisfaction of the decree in accordance with law. In future, 
execution proceedings / execution petition, arising out of 
decree passed by learned Judge Family Court, would be 
transferred keeping in view the spirit of Section 25-A of the 
Act of 1964 as well as observations recorded hereinabove. 
Copy of this judgment be sent to all District and Sessions 
Judges in the Punjab for its further circulation amongst all 
Judicial Officers.” 
In a latter case SAWERA IKRAM versus AMIR NAVEED (PLD 2022 Lahore 
600) another learned Single Bench of this Court, however, has 
adopted some other view. The relevant extract from the same is 
reproduced below :- 
“6. 
Concluding the above discussion and observations, the 
following directions are issued to be followed by the District 
Judges of the Punjab and the Family Courts in future:- 
1. While passing the money decree in respect of 
maintenance allowance, alternate prices of dower or 
dowry articles, the provisions of section 13(3) of the 
Family Courts Act, 1964 should be adhered to, which 
provides that, 'Where a decree relates to the payment of 
money and the decretal amount is not paid within the 
time specified by the Court [not exceeding thirty days] 
the same shall, if the Court so directs, be recovered as 
arrears of land revenue, and on recovery shall be paid to 
the decree-holder.' 
2. The District Judge will designate a Civil Judge as 
Executing Court in the District as well as Tehsils, as 
the case may be, where the execution petitions for 
satisfaction of decrees passed by the Judge Family 
Court will be filed and executed/satisfied in accordance 
with law by adopting all measures in this regard. 
3. In case the judgment debtor resides in some other 
District and owns property, precept will be transmitted 
for attachment purposes and further proceedings will 
be taken in accordance with law.” 
We feel no cavil to observe here that in presence of judgment in the 
case of Mian MUHAMMAD ARSHAD versus SABA GUL and 5 others (2022 
MLD 1280) the latter Bench who adopted different view in the case of 
[SAWERA IKRAM versus AMIR NAVEED (PLD 2022 Lahore 600)] should 
have referred the matter to the Hon’ble Chief Justice for 
constitution of Larger Bench in case of difference of opinion but it 
appears that judgment in the case of Mian Muhammad Arshad 
supra was not brought in the notice of later learned Bench. Guidance 

T.A. No.31 of 2022 
 
-5- 
 
in this respect can be sought from Mst. SAMRANA NAWAZ and others 
versus M.C.B. BANK LTD. and others (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 581). The 
relevant extract from the same is reproduced below :- 
“7. 
We are, however, bound by the judgment delivered 
by a Bench of co-equal strength, i.e., a three member Bench, 
in the said case and therefore cannot hold otherwise. It is 
now a well-established principle of practice and procedure 
of this Court that the earlier judgment of a Bench of this 
Court is binding not only upon the Benches of smaller 
numeric strength but also upon the Benches of coequal 
strength; a Bench of co-equal strength cannot deviate from 
the view held by an earlier Bench, and if a contrary view has 
to be taken, then the proper course is to request the Hon'ble 
Chief Justice for constitution of a larger Bench to reconsider 
the earlier view. For, the law declared by this Court should 
be clear, certain and consistent, as it is binding on all other 
courts of the country, under Article 189 of the Constitution 
of Pakistan, 1973. The doctrine of binding precedent 
promotes certainty and consistency in judicial decisions, and 
ensures an organic and systematic development of the law. 
8. 
It would be important to mention here that our 
learned brother, Justice Umar Ata Bandial, was a member of 
the three member Bench that decided the case of Habib and 
Company (supra) and was also the member, and author of 
the order, of the two member Bench that granted leave in 
C.P. No.756-L of 2020 (now numbered as C.A. 364-L of 
2020) to consider the question under discussion. This shows 
that his lordship also doubted the correctness of the view 
expressed in the said case and deemed it proper to re-
consider the same. The two-Member Bench that granted the 
leave, however, did not make a request to the Hon'ble Chief 
Justice for constitution of a larger Bench to reconsider the 
question, for a smaller Bench cannot request for the 
constitution of a larger Bench to revisit the opinion of a 
larger Bench on any question or principle of law; only a 
Bench of co-equal strength can make such a request. As a 
judgment of a larger Bench is binding on the smaller 
Benches, judicial discipline and propriety demand that a two 
member Bench should follow decision of a three member 
Bench, and if a two member Bench concludes that an earlier 
judgment of a three member Bench is so incorrect that in no 
circumstances can it be followed, the proper course for it is 
to set out the reasons why it could not agree with the 
judgment of the three member Bench and to refer the matter 
to the Hon'ble Chief Justice for constitution of a three 
member Bench. If the three member Bench also comes to the 
conclusion that the earlier judgment of a three member 
Bench is not correct, then the reference of the matter to a 
five member larger Bench is justified. A two member Bench 
cannot jump over a three member Bench and directly ask for 
constitution of a Bench larger than three member Bench, to 
review the principle of law declared by that Bench. 
9. 
In these circumstances, we are of the opinion that 
only a Bench larger than a three member Bench can 
reconsider the question as to the interpretation of the second 
proviso to Rule 90 of Order XXI of CPC, and revisit (if 

T.A. No.31 of 2022 
 
-6- 
 
found necessary) the view expressed by a three member 
Bench in the case of Habib and Company v. MCB (PLD 
2020 SC 227). We, therefore, direct the office to place the 
matter before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of Pakistan for 
appropriate order.” 
4. 
The above clearly amounts to a serious disparity and conflict 
between views of two learned Single Benches, so in order to resolve 
the matter in issue office was directed to place the same before the 
Hon’ble Chief Justice for constitution of the Larger Bench. In the 
wake of above, all these applications are now before us by the orders 
of the Hon’ble Chief Justice, with a moot question as to “how the 
execution proceedings/petitions pending before learned Judge 
Family Court can be transferred to some other place for the 
satisfaction of decree.” 
5. 
Though in these applications there are respondents as well. In 
some of the cases notice(s) was/were though issued to the 
respondent(s) whereas in some of the applications, notices have not 
been issued but we are mindful of the fact that any decision in these 
proceedings would not cause any prejudice to them, so we opted to 
proceed with the matter in their absence. To this effect we are also 
fortified with the judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of 
Mst. KULSOOM RASHEED versus NOMAN ASLAM (PLD 2021 Supreme 
Court 579). 
6. 
We have heard learned counsel for the applicants at 
considerable length and perused the record. 
7. 
Family Courts were established after the promulgation of 
West Pakistan Family Courts (Act XXXV of 1964) (hereinafter 
referred to as “Act, 1964”) for a specific purpose and object, so as to 
ensure expeditious settlement and resolution of disputes relating to 
marriage and family affairs as well as the matters connected 
therewith, which is even evident from the preamble of the Act ibid. 
The prime object of the “Act, 1964” appears to be nothing but to 
protect weaker and vulnerable segments of the society i.e. woman 
and children and to extend every possible convenience in the process 
of resolution of disputes. This was the reason that Section 12-A 
which was though initially not part of the “Act, 1964” but was 

T.A. No.31 of 2022 
 
-7- 
 
introduced through Ordinance LV of 2002, whereby Family Courts 
have been bound down to decide the cases within six months from 
the date of institution. 
8. 
Adverting to the core issue it is observed that Section 13 of the 
“Act, 1964” deals with the enforcement of decrees of the Family 
Court, which reads as under :- 
“S. 13.  Enforcement of decrees.– (1) The Family Court shall 
pass a decree in such form and in such manner as may be 
prescribed, and shall enter its particulars in the prescribed 
register. 
      (2)  If any money is paid or any property is delivered in the 
presence of the Family Court, in satisfaction of the decree, it shall 
enter the fact of payment or the delivery of property, as the case may 
be, in the aforesaid register. 
      (3)  Where a decree relates to the payment of money and 
the decretal amount is not paid within time specified by the 
Court not exceeding thirty days, the same shall, if the Court so 
directs be recovered as arrears of land revenue, and on recovery 
shall be paid to the decree-holder. 
      (4)  The decree shall be executed by the Court, passing it or by 
such other Civil Court as the District Judge may, by special or 
general order, direct. 
      (5)  A Family Court may, if it so deems fit, direct that any 
money to be paid under a decree passed by it be paid in such 
installments as it deems fit. 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
9. 
The foremost question before us is “whether Family Court is 
entirely a different entity or it has some nexus with Civil 
Court.” Though from the bare reading of sub-section (4) of section 
13 it clearly manifests that a Civil Court is at par with the Family 
Court at-least for the purpose of execution of the decree but this 
perhaps would not be sufficient enough to lay the issue at rest. In this 
regard we would like to refer Section 6 of “Act, 1964”, whereby the 
supervision of a Family Court has been given to learned District 
Judge as that of Civil Court in the respect of district. Reliance to this 
effect can be placed on MUHAMMAD KHALIL versus Mst. ZAHIDA 
PERVEEN and others (PLD 1991 Lahore 51). The relevant extract from 
the same is reproduced below :- 

T.A. No.31 of 2022 
 
-8- 
 
“5………..The question as to whether the Family Court is a 
Court also does not present any difficulty. Section 3 of the 
Punjab Family Courts Act 1964 empowers the Government to 
establish Family Courts and to appoint a Judge for each of such 
Courts. It is the thus obvious that the Family Court is a Court and 
matter falling within its jurisdiction is entrusted to it in its 
capacity as a Court and not a persona designate. This view finds 
support in the judgment by this Court in Mst. Gaman v. Taj Din 
PLD 1968 Lahore 987. 
The next question which arises is whether the cases before the 
Family Courts are of civil nature. It was observed by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Hussain Bakhsh v. Settlement 
Commissioner, Rawalpindi and other PLD 1970 SC 1 that:-- 
“In order to determine whether a proceeding is a civil 
proceeding or not, it is necessary to see what are the 
questions raised and decided in the proceeding. If the 
proceeding involves the assertion or enforcement of a 
civil right, it is a civil proceeding.” 
Undoubtedly, the rights which are adjudicated upon by the 
Family Courts are civil rights. In Mirza Daud Baig v. Additional 
District Judge, Gujranwala and others 1987 S C M R 1161, it 
was observed that “Family Court is a Civil Court in every sense 
despite the exclusion of the Code of Civil Procedure and the 
Evidence Act, 1872 in their application to proceedings before 
such a Court”. Similar view was taken by a Division Bench of 
this Court in Muhammad Anwar Khan v. Additional District 
Judge, Rawalpindi etc. P L D 1978 Lahore 716, wherein it was 
laid down that the Family Court was a Civil Court 
notwithstanding having been created by a special statute and 
mentioned in the Act as distinct from Civil Court.”  
10. 
There is no cavil that applicability of all the provisions of the 
Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred to as 
“C.P.C.”) except Sections 10 & 11 have been ousted to the 
proceedings before the Family Court in terms of Section 17 of the 
“Act, 1964” but this was only for the prime purpose to avoid 
procedural formalities, which may operate as hurdle in the speedy 
and swift decision of disputes brought before the court under the 
“Act, 1964”. At the same time we feel no hesitation to observe that 
there is no impediment in the way of Family Court to adopt the 
procedure provided in the “C.P.C.” to foster the justice. Reference to 
the above effect can be made to Haji MUHAMMAD NAWAZ versus 
SAMINA KANWAL and others (2017 SCMR 321) and Mst. SHABNAM BIBI 
and 3 others versus KHAN BADSHAH and 3 others (2012 MLD 1795). 
11. 
In order to understand the issue in more convenient way, we 
can advert to the West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965 

T.A. No.31 of 2022 
 
-9- 
 
(hereinafter referred to as “Rules, 1965”) which were framed to carry 
out the purpose of the “Act, 1964”. Rule 3 ordains that courts of the 
District Judge, the Additional District Judge, the Civil Judge, the 
President of the Majlis-e-Shoora Kalat, and the Qazi appointed under 
the Dastur-ul-Amal diwani Riasat Kalat, shall be the Family Courts 
for the purposes of the Act. Rule 7 is more pertinent, which is 
reproduced below for the purpose of ease of reference :- 
“7. 
Suits triable under the Act shall be instituted in, and be 
heard and tried by, the Court of the Civil Judge having 
jurisdiction as provided in rule 6, and where in any District 
there is no such Court, such suits shall be instituted in, and be 
heard and tried by the Court of the District Judge or the 
Additional District Judge.” 
From the bare perusal of above rule, it is clearly evident that there is 
no mark distinction between a Family Court and the Civil Court. 
Furthermore Rules 15 to 21 of the “Rules, 1965” eliminates any 
element of distinction between a Family Court and Civil Court for 
the purpose of registering of cases, decrees, orders, etc. which are 
reproduced below :- 
“15.  When a plaint has been filed, its particulars shall be 
entered in a register to be kept in the form prescribed for Civil 
Suits under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. 
16.  
In every suit, on passing the judgment, a decree shall be 
drawn up in Form I and shall be signed by the presiding Judge. 
The decree shall bear the seal of the Court. 
17.  
The Court shall maintain a register of decrees and 
orders in the form prescribed for decrees and orders under the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. 
18.  
Whenever any fine is paid under section 15 or section 
16 or money or property is deposited with or realized by the 
Court under the Act or these rules, a receipt shall be given in 
Form II which shall be serially numbered and the counterfoil 
thereof shall be kept in the Court. 
19.  
All fines, monies, or property deposited or realized and 
disbursed by the Court shall be entered in a register in Form 
III. 
20.  
Where the Court receives any amount payable to a 
party it shall cause a notice thereof to be served on the party 
entitled to receive it and shall pay it to the party concerned 
within four days, so far as may be of his applying therefor. 
21. 
The records of the Court, including its registers, shall 
be preserved for such period as is provided under the rules of 
the High Court applicable to Civil Courts.” 

T.A. No.31 of 2022 
 
-10- 
 
12. 
We have noticed that in the case of Mian Muhammad Arshad 
supra learned Single Bench while dealing with the issue rested 
findings while being influenced with the plenary language of Section 
25-A of the “Act, 1964” generally and more particularly word 
“proceedings” used therein. As we have already observed that there 
is no notable difference between Family Court and Civil Court, so 
general procedure for both the courts would almost remain the same 
until something is specifically barred or amounts to cause a serious 
prejudice to any of the party.  
13. 
Section 24 of “C.P.C.” is almost similar and akin to Section 
25-A of the “Act, 1964”, so both the Sections are reproduced below 
for comparative analysis :- 
“24. General power of transfer and withdrawal.--(1) On the 
application of any of the parties and after notice to the parties and after 
hearing such of them as desire to be heard, or of its own motion 
without such notice, the High Court or the District Court may at any 
stage 
(a) transfer any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending before it for 
trial or disposal to any Court subordinate to it and competent to try or 
dispose of the same, or 
(b) withdraw any suit, appeal or other proceeding pending in any Court 
subordinate to it, and  
(i) try or dispose of the same ; or 
(ii) transfer the same for trial or disposal to any Court subordinate to it 
and competent to try or dispose of the same ; or 
(iii) retransfer the same for trial or disposal to the Court from which it 
was withdrawn. 
(2) Where any suit or proceeding has been transferred or withdrawn 
under subsection (1), the Court which thereafter tries such suit may, 
subject to any special directions in the case of an order of transfer, 
either retry it or proceed from the point at which it was transferred or 
withdrawn. 
(3) For the purposes of' this section, Courts of Additional and Assistant 
Judges shall be deemed to subordinate to the District Court. 
(4) The Court trying any suit transferred or withdrawn under this 
section from a Court of Small Causes shall, for the purposes of' such 
suit, be deemed to be a Court of Small Causes.” 
“S. 25-A.    Transfer of cases.-– (1) Notwithstanding anything 
contained in any law the High Court may, either on the 
application of any party or of its own accord, by an order in 
writing– 
      (a)   transfer any suit or proceeding under this Act from one 
Family Court to another Family Court in the same 

T.A. No.31 of 2022 
 
-11- 
 
district or from a Family Court of one district to a 
Family Court of another district; and 
      (b)   transfer any appeal or proceeding under this Act, from 
the District Court of one district to the District Court of 
another district. 
      (2)  A District Court may, either on the application of any 
party or of its own accord, by an order in writing, transfer any 
suit or proceeding under this Act from one Family Court to 
another Family Court in a district or to itself and dispose it of as 
a Family Court. 
(2a) Where a Family Court remains vacant or the presiding 
officer remains on leave or absent for any reason, except due to 
vacations, for more than thirty days a District Court may, either 
on the application of any party or of its own accord, by order in 
writing, transfer any suit or proceeding from such Family Court 
to another Family Court in a District or to itself and disposed it 
of as a Family Court. 
(2b) On the application of any of the parties and after notice 
to the parties and after hearing such of them as desire to be 
heard, or of its own motion without such notice, the Supreme 
Court may at any stage transfer any suit, appeal or other 
proceedings under this Act pending before a Court in one 
Province to a Court in another Province, competent to try or 
dispose of the same. 
      (3)  Any Court to which a suit, appeal or proceeding is 
transferred 
under 
the 
preceding 
sub-sections, 
shall, 
notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, have the 
jurisdiction to dispose it of in the manner as if it were instituted 
or filed before it: 
      Provided that on the transfer of a suit, it shall not be 
necessary to commence the proceedings before the succeeding 
Judge de novo unless the Judge, for reasons to be recorded in 
writing directs otherwise.” 
 (Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
The above referred both the provisions deal with transfer, 
entrustment or withdrawal of the proceedings from one court to 
another and such powers in the case of former provision vest with 
High Court or the District Court whereas in the latter it falls within 
the domain of the High Court and the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The 
scheme and object of both the provisions is, however, seems to be 
same. If we take into account the principles in the case of Mian 
MUHAMMAD ARSHAD versus SABA GUL and 5 others (2022 MLD 1280) 
that in presence of Section 13 of “Act, 1964”, for the transfer of any 
proceeding the resort should be made to Section 25-A of the Act ibid 
then on the same analogy for seeking transfer of the proceedings 
under the “C.P.C.”, Section 24 can only be pressed, leaving the

provisions contained in Part II of Order XXI of “C.P.C.” dealing 
with the execution petitions/proceedings redundant. 
14. 
Needless to observe that execution proceedings are not 
synonymous to the original proceedings where the court has to make 
an adjudication of the respective rights of the parties, which 
ultimately culminates into decree. In the former case the executing 
court ordinarily is not required to involve itself in the determination 
of intricate questions of fact or law but to proceed in terms of the 
decree for its satisfaction. 
15. 
Part II of “C.P.C.” deals with the execution and it provides a 
detailed mechanism for the execution of decree passed by a court. 
Section 38 of the “C.P.C.” lays down that a decree may be executed 
either by the court which passed it, or by the court to which it is sent 
for execution. We are mindful of the fact that Section 13 of the “Act, 
1964” neither provides detailed mechanism for the execution of 
decree nor caters all the eventualities arising from the execution 
proceedings. Sub-section (4) of Section 13 of “Act, 1964” places the 
Family Court and the Civil Court at the same pedestal for the 
purpose of execution of decree, so in that capacity a court “Family” 
or “Civil” enjoys all powers of the executing court vested in Part II 
as well as Order XXI of the “C.P.C.”. Section 39 of the “C.P.C.” 
deals with the transfer of decree which empowers the court who 
passed a decree to send it for execution to another court, on the 
application of the decree holder. We deem it appropriate to reiterate 
that once a decree is passed by the Family Court that becomes 
executable in terms of Section 13 and in case of any hindrance to the 
same, the learned executing court can adopt any of the mode 
provided for the execution of the decree in the “C.P.C.”.  
16. 
For the foregoing reasons this application as well as all 
connected applications seeking transfer of execution proceedings are 
disposed of accordingly leaving the applicants to move the 
respective executing courts for the transfer of execution

proceedings/petitions who shall then proceed with the same in the 
light of observations recorded hereinabove. 
17. 
Before parting we deem it apposite to direct the office to 
circulate the copy of this judgment to all the learned District Judges 
in the Province of Punjab.
