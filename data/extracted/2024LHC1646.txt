Date of hearing 
18.04.2024 
Petitioner By: 
Mr. Muhammad Masood Bilal, Advocate. 
Respondent By: 
Sahibzada Mahmood Ali Khan, Advocate   
 
Faisal Zaman Khan, J:- This civil revision is directed against 
the judgments and decrees dated 04.04.2018 passed by the learned 
civil judge Chichawatni and 08.09.2018 by the learned Additional 
District Judge, Chichawatni. By virtue of the formal judgment a suit 
for possession through pre-emption filed by the petitioner against 
the respondent has been dismissed and through the latter the same 
has been upheld.  
2. 
Succinctly, the facts of the case are that a suit for possession 
through pre-emption was instituted by the petitioner against the 
respondent claiming to have a superior right of pre-emption, wherein 
written statement was filed by the respondent denying the claim of 
the petitioner, whereupon, out of the divergent pleadings of the 
parties as many as 08 issues were framed; evidence pro and contra 
was led, whereafter, through judgment and decree dated 04.04.2018 
the suit was dismissed. Feeling aggrieved, respondent preferred an 
appeal, which was also dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 
08.09.2018, hence, this civil revision.

3. 
At the outset of hearing, learned counsel for the petitioner has 
been confronted with the following propositions that: 
a. 
it has been alleged by the petitioner that he made the 
Talb-e-Muwathibat at the office of the Advocate, 
however, in his plaint neither he has mentioned the 
name of the said Advocate nor his categoric address, 
hence, he has failed to prove the said Talb; 
b. 
since the names of the witnesses of Talb-e-Ishhad have 
not been mentioned in the plaint, therefore, this 
infirmity is fatal for the suit; 
c. 
since the petitioner has failed to produce the 
acknowledgement due card, therefore, he has failed to 
prove that Talb-e-Ishhad was made; and  
d. 
that since the service of notices of Talb-e-Ishhad was 
denied by the respondent, therefore, in order to prove 
the same and keeping in view Section 13 of the Punjab 
Pre-Emption Act (No.IX of 1991) (Act) it was 
imperative for the petitioner to have produced the 
concerned postman and although this requirement of 
law was fulfilled by the petitioner by way of producing 
the postman as PW.6, yet in his deposition the said 
witness has stated that instead of serving the respondent 
personally notice was served upon one Muhammad 
Arshad Khan without establishing that whether service 
could be effected on Muhammad Arshad Khan, who 
was not even the attorney of the respondent, especially 
so when admittedly respondent was out of country, 
therefore, the said service is not valid.

4. 
In spite of his earnest effort, learned counsel for the petitioner 
has not been able to give any plausible explanation.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan while dealing with the 
question of mentioning and proving the time, date and place where 
pre-emptor got the information of sale and made Talb-e-
Muwathibat, in judgments reported as Ch. Riaz Ahmad v. Munir 
Sultan Malik (2022 SCMR 667), Mir Muhammad Khan and 2 
others v. Haider and others (PLD 2020 SC 233) Dr. Pir 
Muhammad Khan v. Khuda Bukhsh and others (2015 SCMR 1243), 
Muhammad Amin v. Zulfiqar and another (2014 SCMR 667), 
Muhammad Hanif v. Tariq Mehmood and others (2014 SCMR 941), 
Allah Ditta through L.Rs. and others v. Muhammad Anar (2013 
SCMR 866), Munawar Hussain and others v. Afaq Ahmed (2013 
SCMR 721), Muhammad Ismail v. Muhammad Yousaf (2012 
SCMR 911), Fazal ur Rehman v. Khurshid Ali and another (2012 
SCMR 635) and Section Officer, Government of the Punjab, 
Finance Department and others v. Ghulam Shabbir (2011 SCMR 
1545) has held that while filing a suit for pre-emption it is 
mandatory for the plaintiff to mention in the plaint categoric details 
qua time, date and place and thereupon, prove the same through his 
evidence. 
7. 
Placing the afore referred case law in juxtaposition with the 
facts of the present case it has surfaced that it was the case of the 
petitioner that he went to the office of his Advocate where he made 
Talb-e-Muwathibat, however, in his plaint neither did he mention 
the name of the Advocate nor his address, hence, he has failed to 
prove this Talb. 
8. 
In order to fill this lacunae petitioner who appeared as PW 2 
has spelled out the name of the Advocate (Mr. Noor Muhammad 

C.R.No.1527-D of 2018  
 
4 
Shaukat) whereas the said counsel appeared as PW 1, however, he 
didn’t utter a single word about the fact that in his office Talb-e-
Muwathibat was made. In fact, in his statement the said witness has 
taken a stance that for preparing the notice of Talb-e-Ishhad, 
petitioner came to his office. 
9. 
The above discrepancy is material in nature and destroys the 
case of the petitioner qua making of Talb-e-Muwathibat, hence, the 
suit has rightly been dismissed. 
 
10. 
Even otherwise the depositions of the petitioner and his 
witnesses are beyond the scope of pleadings as the contents of the 
same qua the place of making Talb-e-Muwathibat as explained in 
paragraph Nos. 7 & 8 supra are different, hence, the same cannot be 
read into. For reference reliance can be placed on Muhammad Aslam 
and others v. Muhammad Anwar (2023 SCMR 1371), Messrs Pak 
Suzuki Motors Company Limited through Manager v. Faisal Jameel 
Butt and another (PLD 2023 S.C. 482), Muhammad Ghaffar 
(Deceased) through L.Rs. and others v. Arif Muhammad (2023 
SCMR 344), Muhammad Rafique and another v. Syed Warand Ali 
Shah and others (2021 SCMR 1068), Abdul Razaq v. Abdul Ghaffar 
and others (2020 SCMR 202), Moiz Abbas v. Mrs. Latifa and others 
(2019 SCMR 74), Combined Investment (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Wali Bhai and 
others (PLD 2016 S.C. 730), Muhammad Nawaz alias Nawaza and 
others v. Member Judicial Board of Revenue and others(2014 
SCMR 914), Messrs Essa Engineering Company Pvt. Ltd. and 
another (2014 SCMR 922), Muhammad Wali Khan and another v. 
Gul Sarwar Khan and another (PLD 2010 S.C. 295) and Abdul 
Haque and others v. Shaukat Ali and 2 others (2003 SCMR 74).  
 
11. 
From further perusal of the plaint, it is also evident that 
although petitioner has mentioned the names of witnesses of Talb-e-

C.R.No.1527-D of 2018  
 
5 
Muwathibat, however, he has failed to mention the names of 
witnesses of Talb-e-Ishhad, therefore, in view of the judgments of 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as Hasham Khan (deceased) 
through L.Rs. v. Waheed Ahmed (2024 SCMR 353), Kashmali Khan 
and others v. Mst. Malala (2023 SCMR 1176), Dr. Pir Muhammad 
Khan v. Khuda Bukhsh and others (2015 SCMR 1243) and 
unreported judgment passed in Civil Petition No.27-L/2016 (Kashif 
Mahmood (decd) through L.Rs. v. Rasheed Ahmad), wherein, it 
has been held that conspicuous absence of names of witnesses of 
Talb-e-Ishhad in the contents of the plaint is fatal to the suit for pre-
emption. In this backdrop, since the names of witnesses of Talb-e-
Ishhad were not mentioned in the plaint, therefore, the same is fatal 
for the suit.  
12. 
Under section 13 of the Act, for performance of Talab-e-
Ishhad, it is mandatory for the pre-emptor that he within two weeks 
of Talb-e-Muwathibat, send notice in writing attested by two truthful 
witnesses under registered cover acknowledgment due to the 
vendee. In case, it is disputed by the vendee that he never received 
the notice, the burden is on the pre-emptor to prove the issuance as 
well as service of the notice. 
13. 
In the case in hand, as respondent in his written statement as 
well as in his evidence has denied the issuance and service of notice 
or Talab-e-Ishhad, therefore, it was mandatory for the petitioner to 
have proved the issuance and receipt/refusal of the notice by 
producing cogent, concrete and confidence inspiring evidence, 
which in this case ex facie is lacking.  
14. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in judgments reported as 
Basharat Ali Khan v. Muhammad Akbar (2017 SCMR 309), Dayam 
Khan and others v. Muslim Khan (2015 SCMR 222), Allah Ditta 
through L.Rs and others v Muhammad Anar (2013 SCMR 866), 

C.R.No.1527-D of 2018  
 
6 
Abdul Khan v. Ramzano Bibi (PLD 2013 SC 193), Bashir Ahmed v. 
Ghulam Rasool (2011 SCMR 762) and Muhammad Bashir and 
others v. Abbas Ali Shah (2007 SCMR 1105) has laid down 
parameters for proving Talab-e-Ishhad. A cumulative reading of the 
above judgments would show that in order to prove issuance and 
service of notice of Talab-e-Ishhad, a pre-emptor has to 
produce/prove the following: 
a) Notices of Talb-e-Ishhad; 
b) Its two truthful attesting witnesses; 
c) Postal receipts; 
d) Acknowledgement due; 
e) Postman, who effected the service (both acceptance or 
refusal). 
 
15. 
In the above backdrop and as admitted by the learned counsel 
for the petitioner, since the petitioner has failed to produce the 
acknowledgement due card through which the alleged notice was 
sent to and received, hence, he has failed to prove this Talb. In view 
of the fact that this document, which was mandatory to prove the 
said Talb, has not been produced, therefore, adverse inference under 
Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order 1984 has to be drawn 
against the petitioner. Reliance can be placed on Muhammad Naeem 
Khan and another v. Muqadas Khan (decd) through L.Rs. and 
another (PLD 2022 S.C. 99), Mst. Zarsheda v. Nobat Khan (PLD 
2022 S.C. 21), Muhammad Sarwar v. Mumtaz Bibi and others (2020 
SCMR 276), Naveed Akram and others v. Muhammad Anwar (2019 
SCMR 1095), Riaz Ahmed v. The State (2010 SCMR 846) and Lal 
Khan v. The State (2006 SCMR 1846). 
16. 
Placing the afore-noted case law in juxtaposition with the 
facts of the present, it is manifest that although postman, who 
alleged to have served the notice of Talb-e-Ishhad upon the 

C.R.No.1527-D of 2018  
 
7 
respondent has been produced by the petitioner as PW.6, yet in his 
deposition the said witness has stated that instead of serving the 
respondent personally notice was served upon one Muhammad 
Arshad Khan, that too without stating that why would the said notice 
was to be served upon Muhammad Arshad Khan, therefore, the said 
service is not valid one and as such the petitioner has miserably 
failed to prove the issuance and service of notice of Talb-e-Ishhad 
upon the respondent  
17. 
It shall also be apposite to mention here that admittedly 
respondent was out of country when the notice of Talb-e-Ishhad was 
issued and instead of sending notice to him petitioner tried to serve 
the respondent through Muhammad Arshad Khan, however, he has 
not been able to prove that whether Muhammad Arshad Khan was 
the attorney of the respondent having the authority to receive the 
notice of Talb-e-Ishhad on his behalf. For the sake of argument if 
this is presumed that the said person was authorized to receive the 
notice, since the said fact has not been  proved by the petitioner, 
hence, even otherwise, the service was not valid. 
18. 
Since the learned counsel for the petitioner have not been able 
to point out any jurisdictional defect or procedural impropriety in the 
impugned judgments and decrees passed by both the courts below, 
therefore, in view of judgments reported as Nasir Ali v. Muhammad 
Asghar (2022 SCMR 1054), Khudadad v. Syed Ghazanfar Ali Shah 
alias S. Inaam Hussain and others (2022 SCMR 933), Mst. 
Zarsheda v. Nobat Khan (PLD 2022 S.C. 21), Muhammad Sarwar 
and others v. Hashmal Khan and others (PLD 2022 S.C. 13), 
Nizam-ud- Din and others v. Sheikh Zia ul Qamar and others (2016 
SCMR 24), Iqbal Ahmed v. Managing Director Provincial Urban 
Development Board, N.W.F.P. Peshawar and others (2015 SCMR 
799), Mandi Hassan alias Mehdi Hussain and another v. 
Muhammad Arif (PLD 2015 SC 137), Mst. Zaitoon Begum v. Nazar 

C.R.No.1527-D of 2018  
 
8 
Hussain and another (2014 SCMR 1469) and Haji Muhammad Din 
v. Malik Muhammad Abdullah (PLD 1994 SC 291) no interference 
can be made by this Court. 
19. 
In view of the above, this revision petition being devoid of 
any merits is dismissed.
