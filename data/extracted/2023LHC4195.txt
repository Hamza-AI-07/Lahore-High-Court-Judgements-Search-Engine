M/s G.A Traders (Sole Proprietorship) 
 
vs. 
  
Allied Bank of Pakistan 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
Date of Hearing 
03.05.2023 
For Appellant  
Syed Zeeshan Haider Zaidi, 
Advocate. 
For Respondent 
Mr. Moiz Tariq, Advocate. 
 
 
MUHAMMAD RAZA QURESHI, J. Through this 
Execution First Appeal under Section 22 of the Financial 
Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (the 
“Ordinance of 2001”), the Appellant has questioned the 
legality and propriety of Order dated 07.03.2023 passed 
by Banking Court No.IV, Lahore, pursuant whereto the 
Objection Petition under section 19 of the Ordinance of 
2001 filed by the Appellant, inter alia, seeking dismissal 
of Execution Petition was dismissed.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the Appellant submits that 
Impugned Order is illegal and unlawful and is liable to be 
set aside. While reiterating the grounds canvassed in the 
instant Appeal, learned counsel submits that the Decree 
Holder Bank while realizing the Judgment and Decree is 
selling the properties of the Appellant/Judgment Debtor 
at a throwaway price. Additionally, learned counsel 
contends that there is a fundamental flaw in the 
calculation of the Decree Holder Bank as though the 
Judgment and Decree was passed in year 1999 when the 
applicable law in field was the Banking Companies 

EFA No.22133 of 2023 
2 
 
(Recovery of Loans, Advances, Credits and Finances) 
Act, 1997 (the “Act of 1997”), but at the time of 
commission of default in year 2002 the applicable law in 
field was Ordinance of 2001, pursuant whereto the only 
remedy against recovery of debt due was through 
charging cost of funds instead of  mark-up beyond the 
contractual stipulation. Learned counsel for the Appellant 
has referred to Order dated 31.03.2016 passed by 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Civil Petition No.632-L of 
2016 and contends that Supreme Court of Pakistan 
ordered the Decree Holder Bank to recover cost of funds 
from the Appellant for the period from the date of decree 
until the date of full payment in cash. According to 
learned counsel, the said Order was passed with the 
consent of the parties and now the Decree Holder Bank 
cannot be allowed to take a somersault and betray the 
direction passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
Lastly submits that the Decree Holder Bank fraudulently 
adjusted an amount of Rs.25,500,000/- against the decree 
of Rs.35,523,413/- on 01.06.2016, whereas the said 
amount had already been recovered on 07.03.2009.  
3. 
Conversely, Mr. Moiz Tariq, Advocate appearing 
on behalf of Decree Holder Bank has ably assisted this 
Court that despite having a Judgment and Decree in its 
favour in year 1999, the Decree Holder Bank is running 
from pillar to post to seek its realization and despite lapse 
of more than 23 years, the Decree Holder Bank could not 
reap the benefits of consent decree passed in favour of 
the Decree Holder Bank. Learned counsel submits that 
the matter has gone up till Supreme Court of Pakistan, 
where the Judgment Debtor misrepresented its position 
and subsequently resiled from the consent order passed 
by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. According to learned 
counsel, the Appellant is misusing the process of law and 

EFA No.22133 of 2023 
3 
 
in garb thereof is dragging the process of realization of 
subject matter Judgment and Decree. According to 
learned counsel, in terms of law, the decree passed in the 
matter will be governed by the law applicable at the time 
of passing the Decree. Since the Act of 1997 was the 
applicable law and Appellant itself consented to the 
recovery of mark-up till realization of said Decree, the 
Appellant cannot be permitted to craft a misconceived 
position of law by seeking a declaration that only cost of 
funds can be recovered from it. Learned counsel lastly 
contends that the Impugned Order is in consonance with 
the position of law as well as facts, therefore, this Appeal 
is liable to be dismissed with exemplary cost. 
4. 
The arguments of learned counsel have been heard 
and record of the case has been minutely perused with 
their able assistance. It appears from the record that on 
account of a default towards financial obligations, the 
Respondent Bank through its Suit bearing C.O.S. 
No.121/1998 sought recovery of an amount of 
Rs.44,914,833/- along with liquidated damages of 
Rs.8,982,966.60 
accumulating 
to 
a 
sum 
of 
Rs.53,897,799.60 along with future mark-up. During the 
pendency of Suit, the parties entered into a settlement 
and pursuant to an Application bearing C.M.No.456-
B/1999, the Settlement Agreement was placed on record 
as Mark ‘A’ and through Order dated 13.09.1999, the 
Decree was passed on the basis of Settlement Agreement. 
By executing the Settlement Agreement/Deed of 
Compromise, the judgment debtors including the 
Appellant admitted the outstanding liability and sought 
extension in the recovery thereof subject to levy of 17% 
mark-up contained in Clause-8 of the Agreement. 

EFA No.22133 of 2023

5. 
On account of default of liabilities under the 
Settlement Agreement, the Respondent Bank was 
constrained to initiate recovery proceedings through 
Execution Petition on 26.10.2002 and thereafter, the 
miseries of Decree Holder Bank started which are 
prolonging on one pretext or the other to date.  
6. 
Initially, the Appellant in order to wriggle out of 
Settlement Agreement and Decree challenged their 
executability before the Banking Court and upon 
dismissal of their Application filed E.F.A No.523/2006. 
The said E.F.A was dismissed by the learned Division 
Bench of this Court through Judgment dated 06.12.2006. 
Subsequently, the other Judgment Debtors along with 
Appellant filed applications challenging Execution 
Petition on the ground of executability and through the 
applications filed before the learned Executing Court, 
inter alia, questioned the recovery of mark-up under the 
Settlement Agreement and Decree passed by learned 
Single Judge in year 1999. The said applications were 
decided against the Appellant by the Banking Court and 
culminated into E.F.A No.868/2011, wherein another 
learned Division Bench of this Court through Judgment 
dated 14.01.2015 dismissed the said appeal along with 
connected appeals. The Appellant along with other 
Judgment Debtors challenged the Judgment before the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan through Civil Petition 
No.464, 476-478 of 2015. The Supreme Court of 
Pakistan through 
its Judgment dated 14.03.2016 
dismissed the Civil Petition, inter alia,  on the following 
terms: 
“……..From the perusal of the Compromise Deed it 
appears that the petitioners acknowledged and 
admitted outstanding amounts against them and 
undertake to pay the same in installments and further 
to  secure  the  fresh  finance  facilities  the petitioners  

EFA No.22133 of 2023 
5 
 
had to execute various charged documents including 
equitable mortgage on present and future assets of 
customers, pledge goods etc. Clause 8 of the 
Compromise deed read as under:- 
"8.   …… 
(a) …… 
(b) …… 
(c) …… 
(d) …… 
From the above referred clause, it appears that in case 
the Petitioner/Customers fail to comply with condition 
of the deed of compromise, the entire package/ 
concessions given by the respondent/Bank to the 
petitioners under the Compromise Deed shall stand 
automatically withdrawn and the Respondent/Bank 
shall be entitled to recovery of all the outstanding 
liabilities of the Customer mentioned in para 1 of the 
Compromise Deed and to file application for execution 
of the consent decrees passed in various suits for the 
full amounts decreed including future mark-up from 
the dates of institution of suits till full payment, less 
any payment made by the customers for liquidation of 
their liabilities mentioned in para 1 of Compromise 
Deed. 
5.  There is neither on record nor our attention is 
drawn to any document that the petitioners have 
fulfilled all the terms of the compromise deed and not 
committed any default. On the other hand it appears 
that after filing execution petitions petitioners tried to 
avoid their liabilities under the decree by filing various 
applications on one ground or other which were 
dismissed by the Courts with cost.” 
 
 
 
 
 
    [Emphasis added] 
7. 
Through the Settlement Agreement and consent 
decree, the Appellant had admitted the liability for 
payment of rescheduled/renewed finance facilities along 
with 17% mark-up payable in the grace period as 
stipulated 
in 
the 
Settlement 
Agreement/Deed 
of 
Compromise. It has not been contended before us nor any 
material in support has been produced that the 
outstanding liability towards finance facilities under the 
Settlement Agreement stood satisfied, therefore, the 
default towards the liabilities rescheduled/ restructured or 
renewed through Deed of Compromise culminating into 

EFA No.22133 of 2023 
6 
 
Consent Decree cannot be termed as inexecutable by 
seeking a declaration that under the Ordinance of 2001 it 
is only recoverable through cost of funds, more 
specifically when the matter already stood adjudicated by 
the Executing Court up till Supreme Court of Pakistan.  
8. 
In our opinion the legal as well as factual points 
now being agitated before us are clearly hit by res 
judicata as the controversy inter se parties stood finally 
decided up till Supreme Court of Pakistan and at this 
stage if the Appellant coins a logic that the instant 
controversy was never agitated earlier in that case the 
present controversy will be hit by constructive res 
judicata as there are chain of decision thereon by the 
Banking Court as well as by learned Division Benches of 
this Court and the Supreme Court of Pakistan. In the 
instant case any challenge to the Compromise Agreement 
or Consent Decree that once raised and finally decided 
will either be hit by principle of res judicata and if 
omitted or relinquished to be raised earlier will surely be 
hit by principles of constructive res judicata. 
9. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case  reported 
as Khushi Muhammad and 2 others v. The Province of 
the Punjab through Secretary to Government of the 
Punjab and 2 others (1999 SCMR 1633) while 
discussing the principle of constructive res judicata has 
observed as under:  
“It has been urged that many of the questions, which 
surfaced, 
pursuant 
to 
the 
memorandum 
dated 
10.08.1982 and which thereupon came up again before 
the High Court, were not raised during the previous 
litigation and, therefore, could freely be re- agitated, 
The premise is erroneous both on the factual and legal 
planes. Thus, it does not seem that any of the crucial 
questions were not raised in the earlier round of 
litigation. Besides, even if there were some such 
questions, each one of the same ought to have been 

EFA No.22133 of 2023 
7 
 
raised in the previous adjudication and in the event any 
of them was not raised, such, as well, attracted the 
principle of constructive res judicata”. 
    
 
 
 
 
    [Emphasis added] 
10. 
Now adverting to the contention of learned counsel 
for the Appellant that Supreme Court of Pakistan through 
its Order dated 31.03.2016 with the consent of the parties 
had directed the recovery of realizable amount through 
cost of finds. Needless to mention that the said Order of 
Supreme Court of Pakistan is annexed at page 18 wherein 
the consent of the parties was recorded and Supreme 
Court of Pakistan couched its decision in the concluding 
paragraph by holding as follows: 
“In case, the full payment is not made by the 
Petitioners within the stipulated period, this Petition 
shall be deemed to have been dismissed. This Petition 
stands disposed of in above terms.” 
 
 
 
 
 
    [Emphasis added] 
11. 
It appears that the Supreme Court bracketed the 
consent with the consequence and Banking Court while 
passing the Impugned Order rightly held that on account 
of default and resiling from the consent given before 
Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Petition filed by the 
Appellant was deemed to have been dismissed and 
commission of default by the Appellant made the said 
consent order inoperative.  
12. 
The contention of the Appellant that mark-up 
cannot be recovered as at the time of initiation of 
execution proceedings, the Ordinance of 2001 was 
applicable and Bank can only recover cost of funds, we 
hold that the said argument is not only flawed and 
meritless, but is also misconceived. It may be wishful 
thinking of the Appellant but the position of law 
emerging after the promulgation of the Ordinance, 2001 
is that in addition to the contractually chargeable mark-
up, a financial institution cannot now claim from Court 

EFA No.22133 of 2023 
8 
 
any additional mark-up except the cost which it had to 
bear for its finance stuck up with its defaulting customer. 
Thus the concept of earning further income in the shape 
of mark-up was replaced with the concept of 
compensating financial institutions with the cost of funds 
and that too is determinable by State Bank as envisaged 
under section 3 of the Ordinance of 2001. Thus the 
change in law i.e. withdrawal of Court's power to award 
mark-up beyond contracted period under the provisions 
of Act of 1997 with the award of cost of funds under the 
Ordinance of 2001 was clearly intended to remove the 
perception that the award of mark-up beyond the 
contracted mark-up is in the nature of interest. 
13. 
Coming to the facts of the present case, as at the 
time of passing of the decree in question the Act of 1997 
was in force, therefore, notwithstanding the harshness of 
the Act of 1997, which permitted award of continuous 
mark-up beyond the contracted mark-up, the court being 
an Executing Court cannot now extend the benefit of the 
new law by replacing the mark-up awarded by the Court 
under Act of 1997 with the award of only cost of funds 
permitted under the Ordinance of 2001. This would 
amount to empowering the Executing Court to amend the 
decree. Reliance in this regard is placed upon “Habib 
Bank Ltd versus Karachi Pipe Mills Ltd.” (2006 CLD 
842). 
14. 
In our view the instant case is true example of 
observations made in previous judgments of this Court as 
well as Supreme Court of Pakistan that agony and 
miseries of the decree holder starts when it institutes 
execution petition seeking realization of judgment and 
decree. Having raised the controversy time and again 
before the Executing Court whose orders were merged up 

EFA No.22133 of 2023 
9 
 
till Supreme Court of Pakistan and at times omitting to 
raise certain objections, the Appellant has misused and 
abused the process of law by tactically delaying the 
realization of subject matter Judgment and Decree and 
this agony cannot be allowed to be prolonged to curb 
fraudulent litigation and waste time of this Court which 
could have been spent in resolving legitimate disputes. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan has already observed that 
such litigations must be curbed by imposing heavy cost. 
Reliance in this regard is placed upon “Commissioner 
Inland Revenue Vs. Packages Limited” (2022 SCMR 
634), “Muhammad Akbar versus Major Taj-ud-Din” 
(2007 SCMR 140) and “Capital Development Authority, 
CDA, through its Chairman, CDA, Islamabad Vs. Ahmad 
Murtaza and another”  Civil Petition No.3709 of 2022. 
15. 
As a consequence of what has been discussed and 
held above, we do not consider that Impugned Order 
passed by Banking Court warrants any interference and 
this Appeal being meritless is dismissed with special 
cost of Rs.300,000/- which is directed to be recovered by 
the Banking Court while realizing the subject matter 
Judgment and Decree. The amount of special cost shall 
be deposited with any charity designated by the 
Executing Court.
