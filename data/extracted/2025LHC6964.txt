Anwaar Hussain, J.  
Through 
this 
constitutional 
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner has called into question 
order dated 02.02.2024 passed by the Executing Court and 
judgment dated 23.10.2024 passed by Appellate Court below, 
pursuant whereto application of the petitioner seeking cancellation 
of warrants of arrest on account of compromise was concurrently 
dismissed by both the Courts below. 
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that on 
04.03.2021, respondent No.3 (“the respondent”) instituted a suit 
for recovery of maintenance allowance, dowry articles and dower 
with the averments that at the time of her marriage, she was given 
dowry articles valuing Rs.1,240,000/- as per list of dowry articles 
annexed with the plaint and her dower in terms of Columns No.13 
and 17 of nikahnama was fixed as  Rs.3,000/- cash, one 
constructed room with four walls and hand pump etc., and despite 

                                                                                                                                                 
 
Writ Petition No. 9437/2024                                                                            2 
repeated demands, the petitioner has neither returned the dowry 
articles nor paid the dower or maintenance allowance to the 
respondent. The respondent contested the suit by filing written 
statement. The defence taken by the respondent is that father of the 
respondent fraudulently got transferred their (respondent’s) land in 
his name whereupon father of the petitioner instituted a suit for 
declaration which was decreed and when fraud committed by 
father of the respondent was proved, she left the house of the 
petitioner at her own. Regarding dower, the petitioner took the 
plea that only a sum of Rs.3,000/- was fixed as dower of the 
respondent, which has been paid, however, he has given a property 
consisting of one room with four walls, hand pump etc., to the 
respondent for residence. He denied that the respondent was given 
any dowry articles. After framing of issues and recording of 
evidence, the Trial Court decreed the suit of the respondent, vide 
judgment and decree dated 15.03.2023, in the terms that she was 
held entitled to recover maintenance allowance at the rate of 
Rs.5,000/- per month from one month prior to institution of the 
suit till payment of her dower and in case of divorce till expiry of 
her iddat period, i.e., three months and recover cash amount of 
Rs.3,000/-, as her dower and one room with four walls and hand 
pump etc., for residence purpose. She was also held entitled to 
recover dowry articles (except gold and silver ornaments, fridge, 
one buffalo and five she goats) or a sum of Rs.80,000/- as alternate 
price thereof. No appeal was filed against the said judgment and 
decree.  
3. 
On 13.06.2023, the respondent filed petition for execution 
of the judgment and decree dated 15.03.2023 wherein non-bailable 
warrants of arrest of the petitioner were issued. On 16.09.2023, the 
petitioner filed application for cancellation of warrants of arrest of 
the petitioner on the ground that a compromise has been effected 

                                                                                                                                                 
 
Writ Petition No. 9437/2024                                                                            3 
between the parties, which was contested by the respondent by 
filing written reply denying any compromise. The application of 
the petitioner for cancellation of warrants of arrest was dismissed 
by the Executing Court vide order dated 02.02.2024. Feeling 
aggrieved, the petitioner filed appeal, which also met with the 
same fate, vide judgment dated 23.10.2024 passed by the 
Additional District Judge, Liaqatpur. Hence, the present writ 
petition has been filed.  
4.  
It is the contention of the petitioner that the nature of 
application was such that it should have been decided in terms of 
Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”) as the 
parties had entered into compromise and pursuant to the settlement 
agreed upon, there was nothing outstanding against the petitioner 
being a judgment debtor. Conversely, learned counsel for the 
respondent has supported the impugned findings of the Courts 
below. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
It stands admitted that the respondent had obtained a decree 
for dowry articles and dower on 15.03.2023. It is equally 
undisputed that on the following day, the parties executed a 
document styled as a Talaqnama that reads as under:

Perusal of the Talaqnama/compromise indicates that ostensibly, 
the respondent undertook to withdraw all her claims. On the 
strength of this document/Talaqnama, the petitioner contends that 
nothing is outstanding whereas the respondent asserts that she was 
misled into signing the said document by the petitioner, who is 
closely related to her. Suffice to note that the Talaqnama, which 
the petitioner contends as a compromise, reflects no detail, 
whatsoever, regarding how the respondent’s decretal entitlements, 
particularly the dowry articles were satisfied within 24 hours of the 
passing of the decree. No amount, alternate payment of dowry 
articles or mode of satisfaction of the decree is recorded. 
Significantly, the petitioner’s own objections filed on 16.09.2023, 
in execution proceedings, contemplate that although divorce had 
been pronounced, the respondent’s entitlements would be satisfied 
by him “in future”. Relevant part of objection petition reads as 
under:  
"3۔ ہی ہک دوران امستع دوعی رفنیقی ےک درایمن اوطسر رپ رایض انہم وہا ہک دماع ہیلع دمہیع وک الطق
 الثہث درکی اینپ زوتیج ےس اگل رک دے اگ ۔
ےکسج دعب دمہیع دعب دعت دقع اثین رک ےکس یگ ۔ اور اسھت یہ
دمہیع ےن وج قح ریس بلط یک نم دموی
ن ایکس قح ریس رکے اگ۔" 
(Emphasis supplied)
 
The above quoted para of the objection petition filed by the 
petitioner defeats the plea of the petitioner that the decree stood 
lawfully satisfied. 

                                                                                                                                                 
 
Writ Petition No. 9437/2024                                                                            5 
7. 
The argument of learned counsel for the petitioner that 
whether the decree was satisfied immediately or not should be 
decided by the Executing Court by framing issues, in terms of 
Section 47 of the CPC, is misconceived inasmuch as Family 
Courts Act, 1964 (“the Act”) establishes a protective procedural 
framework, recognising the inherent social imbalance in 
matrimonial disputes empowering the Court to devise its own 
procedure. By necessary implication, this protective framework 
extends to the Courts executing the decrees. Execution 
proceedings, therefore, cannot be permitted to transform into 
forums where vague, uncertain or potentially exploitative 
documents are allowed to defeat decrees duly passed in family 
matters without a clear, proven and lawful satisfaction of the 
decree. This Court cannot lose sight of the social realities in which 
women—particularly illiterate, domestic and dependent women—
are often vulnerable to pressure, manipulation and unequal 
bargaining circumstances. These considerations, although social in 
nature, have legal consequences: they reinforce the need for strict 
scrutiny of compromises allegedly extinguishing women’s post-
marriage entitlements, especially when such compromises are 
executed within less than 24 hours of passing of a decree in favour 
of the woman and contain no definite terms regarding satisfaction 
of decretal rights.  
8. 
In the present matter, the only clause of the Talaqnama that 
carries certainty is the mutual consent to effect divorce. All other 
clauses are vague, indeterminate and unsupported by any material, 
besides being contradicted by the petitioner’s own stand in the 
objection petition. Allowing such a document to frustrate a decree 
would erode the statutory purpose of the Act and undermine the 
protection it affords to vulnerable litigants/women who may not be 

                                                                                                                                                 
 
Writ Petition No. 9437/2024                                                                            6 
fully aware of their legal rights or the consequences of the 
documents they are induced to sign. 
9. 
For the foregoing reasons, this Court holds that both the 
Courts below acted strictly in accordance with law in refusing to 
accept the Talaqnama as a compromise having effect of valid 
satisfaction of the decree dated 15.03.2023. Their concurrent 
findings warrant no interference. The petition is, therefore, 
dismissed.
