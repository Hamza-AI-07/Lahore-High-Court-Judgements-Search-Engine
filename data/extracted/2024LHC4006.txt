Date of Hearing 
12.09.2024 
Applicant by: 
Mr. Muhammad Suleman Bhatti, Advocate 
Respondent by: 
Ch. Mumtaz-ul-Hassan, Advocate  
 
Anwaar Hussain J. Through this single judgment, present as 
well as connected reference application bearing S.T.R No.26/2021, 
filed under Section 47 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (‘the Act’) against 
common order dated 04.03.2021 passed by the learned Appellate 
Tribunal Inland Revenue, Lahore Bench, Lahore, Special Full Bench 
(“the Tribunal”) in separate appeals preferred by M/s MEPCO and 
M/s FESCO (“the DISCOs”) are collectively being decided as 
common questions of law are involved therein. 
2. 
Though multiple questions of law have been framed, however, 
the common questions pressed for our opinion in these reference 
applications are articulated as under:  
i)  
Whether on the facts and the circumstances of the 
case the learned Appellate Tribunal was justified 
to ignore that the Tariff Differential Subsidy 
(TDS) received from Federal Government as part 
of the electricity price has not been exempted from 
levy of sales tax in terms of Section 13 read with 
Sixth Schedule of the Sales Tax Act, 1990? 
ii)  
Whether on the facts and the circumstances of the 
case 
the 
learned 
Appellate 
Tribunal’s 
interpretation of clause (46) of Section (2) of the 
Sales Tax Act, 1990 has assigned a narrow 
meaning which confines value of supply to the 
extent of consideration received directly from 

 
 
2 
S.T.R No.25/2021 
recipient of supply by ignoring component of 
payments received on behalf of recipient of 
supply? 
 
3. 
At the outset, learned counsel for the DISCOs submits that by 
way of amendment effected in the year 2022, the explanation has been 
added at the end of sub-clause (i) of Clause (46) of Section 2 of the 
Act, as a consequence of which it is clarified by the legislature that the 
value of supply does not include the amount of subsidy provided by 
the Federal Government or the Provincial Governments to the 
electricity consumers. Confronted with the situation, learned counsel 
for the applicant-department submits that the amendment has no 
retrospective applicability. Adds that issue of subsidy was decided in 
favour of the department in the case of “Commissioner Inland 
Revenue, LTO, Lahore v. Messrs Gujranwala Electric Power Co. 
(GEPCO)” (2024 PTD 440). 
4. 
Heard.  
5. 
The nub of the matter is to examine applicability of explanation 
added in sub-clause (i) of Clause (46) of Section 2 of the Act, which 
contemplates an unequivocal clarification that the subsidy is not 
chargeable to the tax under the Act in case of DISCOs. For facility of 
reference, the amendment is reproduced hereunder: 
“3. 
Amendments of the Sales Tax Act, 1990. – In       
the Sales Tax Act, 1990, the following further 
amendments shall be made, namely:–   
(1) 
in section 2, –  
(a) 
… 
(b) 
… 
(c) 
… 
(d) 
… 
(e) 
at the end of sub-clause (i) of clause (46), 
for the expression “; and”, the expression “:” 
shall be substituted and thereafter the 
following Explanation shall be inserted, 
namely:–  
Explanation. — It is clarified that the value 
of supply does not include the amount of 

 
 
3 
S.T.R No.25/2021 
subsidy provided by the federal government 
or provincial governments to the electricity 
consumers and has never been chargeable 
to tax under the Act; and”     
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
It is imperative to note that similar question came before this Court in 
S.T.R No.77467/2022 titled “Commissioner Inland Revenue v. M/s 
GEPCO Limited” and vide judgment dated 25.05.2023, a Division 
Bench of this Court, at the Principal Seat held as under: 
“The argument of learned counsel for the applicant/ 
department that the amendment effected in sub-clause (i) 
of Clause (46) of Section 2 of the Act has no retrospective 
effect has no force inasmuch as the legislature has clearly 
explained that subsidy provided by the Government(s) 
was never chargeable to tax under the Act, therefore, 
question whether or not said amendment has retrospective 
effect becomes irrelevant.”   
6. 
Similar opinion was expressed by another learned Division 
Bench of this Court in reference application bearing S.T.R 
No.113/2014 titled “Commissioner Inland Revenue v. M/s Faisalabad 
Electricity Supply Co. Ltd., vide order dated 06.02.2024 in the 
following terms: 
 
2. 
……In this regard having heard the parties, we do 
not find that the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue has 
committed an error in the construction of the rule 
13(2)(b) of the Sales Tax Special Procedure Rules, 2007 
to hold that the term ‘all charges and surcharges, loan and 
all duties and taxes chargeable to tax’ should not be read 
in isolation and must have nexus with the supply of 
electric power. Further, the Appellate Tribunal was 
correct in holding that since the primary law prescribes 
charges exclusively in relation to supply of goods, 
therefore, the rules could not be construed otherwise.”   
 
7. 
It is pertinent to mention that Explanation to section 2(46) of 
the Act was inserted through the Finance Act 2022, after the passing 
of order(s) by the Tribunal. The matter was decided against 

 
 
4 
S.T.R No.25/2021 
department by the Tribunal while observing that there was no 
clarification in the law regarding the identity of the obligator. 
Notwithstanding subsequent introduction of the Explanation, when 
scope and applicability of the Explanation is clear, and already 
interpreted in the case of M/s GEPCO Limited supra, we are not 
inclined to remand the matter. Judgment cited by learned counsel for 
applicant-department in the case of Commissioner Inland Revenue, 
LTO, Lahore supra has no relevance to the subject matter questions, 
which is regarding determination of Income Tax liability in the 
context of turnover tax regime – [Section 113 of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001]. 
8. 
In view of the above discussion, the present as well as 
connected reference application are decided in favour of the 
respondents and against the applicant-department. Reference 
applications are accordingly dismissed.  
9. 
Office shall send a copy of this order under Seal of the Court to 
the Tribunal as per Section 47(5) of the Act.
