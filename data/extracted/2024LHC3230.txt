SADAQAT ALI KHAN, J.  Entire area of 
Revenue Estate of Mouza Murree Brewery is 708-
Kanals & 18-Marlas which is situated in the hilly area 
of Murree and was owned by Murree Brewery 
Company Limited which constructed a Brewery and 
Malt House along with few residential houses with 
Pacca passages for the use of staff of the company. In 
the year 1943, on shifting of the Murree Brewery to 
Rawalpindi, the company sold the Murree Brewery 
with open land of the Estate to M/S Kirpa Ram 
Brothers, who converted the building portion of the 
Estate into a hotel i.e. Kashmir Hotel.

C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
2. 
 
In the year 1947, during partition of sub-
continent, M/S Kirpa Ram Brothers migrated to India. The 
buildings constructed in Murree Brewery Estate were 
either burnt or extensively damaged. The remaining area 
of Murree Brewery Estate was characterized in the special 
Jamabandi for the year 1947 and record prepared by the 
Settlement 
Authorities 
shows 
it; 
Banjar 
Qadeem, 
culturable land and non-culturable land, Ghair Mumkin 
Pahaars, road, Water Tanks and Abadi.  
3. 
 
It is important to note here that vide Notification 
dated 24.11.1956, Mouza Murree Brewery was brought 
within the limits of Municipal Committee, Murree.  
4. 
 
In the year 1960, statedly Tehsildar Murree 
proposed certain area of land of Murree Brewery Estate in 
the Register RL-II for the allotment to Nafisa(Nafees) Banu 
and her husband Khan Abdul Shafi Khan Barqi, who was 
an Assistant Executive Officer, NWR, (North Western Estate 
Railway) 
at 
relevant 
time, 
predecessors 
of 
private 
respondents (appellants in I.C.A. No.09 of 2020). 
5. 
 
Meanwhile, 
the 
Deputy 
Commissioner 
Rawalpindi, directed the concerned authorities not to allot 
any land in Murree Brewery Estate.  
6. 
 
This 
order 
of 
the 
Deputy 
Commissioner 
Rawalpindi, was challenged by the private respondents by 
filing an appeal before the Additional Settlement and 
Rehabilitation 
Commissioner, Rawalpindi which was 
allowed 
and 
Sub-Divisional 
Officer, 
Murree 
while 
exercising 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
Assistant 
Settlement 
Commissioner (Land), statedly confirmed the proposal of 
the allotment of the land in favour of predecessors of the 
private respondents (Nafisa/Nafees Banu and her husband Khan Abdul 
Shafi Khan Barqi). It is important to note here that the Sub-
Divisional Officer was not vested specifically with the 

3 
C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
powers of the Assistant Settlement Commissioner (Land) at 
the relevant time. 
7. 
The Chief Settlement Commissioner cancelled so 
called allotment in favour of predecessors of the private 
respondents vide order dated 09.10.1963. The private 
respondents challenged this Order by filing Settlement 
Revision Petition u/s 21 of The Displaced Persons (Land 
Settlement) Act, 1958 (“The Act 1958”) before this Court 
which was allowed vide order dated 20.11.1968 by setting 
aside the Order dated 09.10.1963 passed by the Chief 
Settlement 
Commissioner, 
Pakistan 
and 
case 
was 
remanded to him (Chief Settlement Commissioner, Pakistan) for 
decision afresh in accordance with law.  
8. 
 
In the post remand proceedings, the Chief 
Settlement Commissioner again had not accepted the 
claim of the private respondents vide order dated 
06.12.1971 which was challenged before this Court by 
filing the Settlement Revision Petition No.38 of 1972. It is 
important to note here that one Rana Mehmood Khan and 
Miraj Hassan etc had also filed separate settlement 
Revision Petitions Nos.75 and 30 of 1972 respectively for 
allotment of land in their favour from the Estate of Mouza 
Murree Brewery. All these three Settlement Revision 
Petitions have been heard by this Court on 20.07.2000 
and allowed vide consolidated judgment dated 03.10.2000 
(“Judgment under implementation”).  
9. 
 
The 
Chief 
Settlement 
& 
Rehabilitation 
Commissioner challenged this consolidated Judgment 
before the Supreme Court of Pakistan by filing civil 
appeals No. 484 to 486 of 2002 which were dismissed on 
technical ground vide Order dated 13.12.2007 which is 
hereby reproduced:-  
“The office has reported that the appellants in these 
appeals have not provided proper addresses of 

4 
C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
respondents mentioned in the summons notice nor 
the legal representatives of respondent No.4 in Civil 
Appeal No.484/2002 have been brought on record. 
Neither Mr.M.A.Qureshi, AOR nor any one else has 
appeared on behalf of the appellants despite these 
matters having been called time and again. Even the 
needful, as pointed out by the office, does not appear 
to have been done by the appellants. Therefore, Civil 
appeals No.484 to 486 are dismissed and summons 
notice is disposed of.”  
 
10.  
It is important to note here that Rana Mehmood 
Khan, petitioner in Settlement Revision Petition No.75 of 
1972 and Miraj Hassan and others, petitioners in 
Settlement Revision Petition No.30 of 1972 despite 
acceptance of their claim vide consolidated judgment 
dated 03.10.2000 passed by this Court discussed above 
sensing the situation i.e. their claim was baseless, have 
not come to the court for implementation of the judgment. 
The Deputy Commissioner Murree, present in the Court 
with record submits that they have not approached the 
Revenue Authority for implementation of the judgment in 
revenue 
record 
but 
the 
private 
respondents 
filed 
Crl.Org.No.32 of 2017 for implementation of the judgment 
dated 03.10.2000 which was dismissed by the Single 
Bench of this Court vide Order dated 10.04.2019. Then, 
they (private respondents) filed Writ Petition No.2290 of 2019 
for implementation of the judgment dated 03.10.2000 
which 
was 
also 
dismissed 
vide 
judgment 
dated 
14.01.2020. Then, they (private respondents) filed ICA No.09 of 
2020 against the judgment of dismissal of their writ 
petition which was disposed of vide judgment dated 
21.10.2020 by this Court with modification in the 
judgment discussed above that competent authority will 
pass appropriate order for implementation of consolidated 
judgment dated 03.10.2000 strictly in accordance with 
law.  
11.  
The 
Chief 
Settlement 
Commissioner 
has 
challenged the order of ICA dated 21.10.2020 supra by 

5 
C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
filing instant C.M. (application u/s 12 (2) CPC) which is being 
decided through this judgment after receiving reply from 
the private respondents. 
12.  
After hearing both the parties and on perusal of 
the record with their able assistance, we have observed as 
under:- 
i. 
Admittedly, 
neither 
the 
suit 
land 
is 
in 
possession of the private respondents nor ever 
remained with them.  
ii. 
It is mentioned in Para-4 of the consolidated 
judgment dated 03.10.2000 passed by this 
Court in Settlement Revision Petitions Nos.30, 
38 (relating to suit land) and 75 of 1972 that the 
Murree Brewery Estate was brought within the 
limits of Municipal Committee Murree in the 
year 1956 (vide notification dated 24.11.1956), which 
means, status of the suit land has been 
changed from rural to urban land. The private 
respondents claim their right for the allotment 
of suit land under The Act 1958 read with West 
Pakistan 
Rehabilitation 
Settlement 
Scheme 
1956 (“The Scheme 1956”) being Displaced 
Persons (Indian Migrants)  
iii. 
Land is defined in Para-(i) of Chapter-1 of Part-1 
of The Scheme 1956 i.e. land means all 
evacuee land held  for agricultural purposes or 
for purposes subservient to agriculture or for 
pasture etc…. 
iv. 
Urban immovable property is defined in para (ix) 
of chapter 1 of part 1 of The Scheme 1956 i.e. 
urban immoveable property means,-- (a) all 
immoveable property situated within the limits 
of a corporation, a municipal committee etc…. 

6 
C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
v. 
It is mentioned in para 4-A of chapter 2 of part 
1 of The Scheme 1956 that the following 
categories of land will not be allotted under the 
Rehabilitation Settlement Scheme and will 
remain excluded from the scheme i.e. (i) urban 
land (Urban immoveable property). 
ii…. 
vi. 
In view of above, this Court had no jurisdiction 
to allot suit land being urban land to private 
respondents vide judgment dated 03.10.2000 
discussed above. 
vii. 
It has specifically been mentioned in Para 44-A 
of Chapter (1) of part (2) of The Scheme 1956 
that rural evacuee agricultural land available in 
six border districts Sialkot, Gujranwala, Gujrat, 
Jhelum, Rawalpindi and Attock should be 
reserved and utilized for temporary allotment to 
those Jammu and Kashmir refugees who can 
cultivate the land themselves. The transfer of 
claims under any circumstances to these 
districts should not be permitted which para (44-
A) is hereby reproduced:- 
“44-A. Allotment to Jammu and Kashmir refugees. 
After meeting the claims pending on 12th February, 
1957, 
for 
settlement 
under 
the 
Rehabilitation 
Settlement Scheme, all categories of rural evacuee 
agricultural land available in six border districts of 
Sialkot, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Jhelum, Rawalpindi and 
Attock should be reserved and utilized for temporary 
allotment to those Jammu and Kashmir refugees who 
can cultivate the land themselves. The transfer of 
claims under any circumstances to these districts 
should not be permitted. The evacuee land thus 
allotted to Jammu and Kashmir refugees will be from 
the Rehabilitation Settlement Scheme.”  
 
viii. 
Suit land at that relevant time was part of 
district Rawalpindi and could not have been 
allotted to Indian Migrants (private respondents). In 
these circumstances, this Court had also no 

7 
C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
jurisdiction to allot suit land to Indian Migrants 
(private 
respondents) vide consolidated judgment 
dated 03.10.2000 discussed above.  
ix. 
This Court while narrating the facts of present 
case in para 2 of consolidated judgment dated 
03.10.2000 has mentioned that the private 
respondents were allotted land (suit land) against 
their verified claims under The Scheme 1956 
on the basis of their entitlement as determined 
through register RL-II which is not supported by 
the record.  
x. 
The Deputy Commissioner present in the Court 
submits that neither the private respondents 
had 
submitted 
their 
claims 
being 
Indian 
Migrants 
to 
Registering 
or 
an 
Additional 
Registering Officer nor same (claims) have been 
verified by the Claims Commissioner or the 
Additional or Deputy Claims Commissioner in 
view of relevant provisions of Registration of 
Claims (Displaced persons) Act, 1956. So 
mentioning 
of 
verified 
claims 
under 
The 
Scheme 1956 in the consolidated judgment 
dated 03.10.2000 while narrating the facts of 
the case by this Court is result of misleading by 
the private respondents against the record.  
xi. 
In absence of meeting with said requirements, 
the private respondents have absolutely no right 
to claim for the allotment of the suit land, rather 
private respondents have obtained consolidated 
judgment by misleading the Court against the 
record.  
xii. 
During the pendency of criminal original No. 32 
of 2017, Nayer Iqbal, Member (Judicial-V)/Chief

C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
Settlement Commissioner Board of Revenue, 
Punjab, Lahore while submitting his report 
Dated 
19.03.2018 
before 
this 
Court 
has 
observed as under:- 
“After perusal of record and reports, no traces of 
any allotments in favour of the petitioners have 
been found either in revenue or in settlement 
record yet. Even scrutiny of allotments was never 
ever made at any stage at any proper form. The 
procedure laid down in Rehabilitation Scheme 
framed 
under 
the 
Displaced 
persons 
land 
settlement Act, 1958 was never followed which 
make the allotments and claims as doubtful.” 
 
xiii. 
The Deputy Commissioner has produced copy of 
report dated 28.03.2018 prepared by the 
committee 
constituted 
by 
Deputy 
Commissioner, Rawalpindi under the directions 
of

On 
29.06.2019, 
the 
Additional 
Deputy 
Commissioner 
(Revenue), 
Rawalpindi 
while

C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
dismissing 
the 
application 
of 
private 
respondents had observed in Para 7 as under :-

xv. 
This 
order 
of 
the 
Additional 
Deputy 
Commissioner, 
Rawalpindi 
has 
not 
been 
challenged rather on 30.07.2019 Aurangzeb 
Shafi Barqi along with others filed Writ Petition 
No.2290 of 2019  which also does not show that 
order 
dated 
29.06.2019 
passed 
by 
the 
Additional Deputy Commissioner, Rawalpindi 
had been challenged in said writ petition, rather 
this order had been concealed which writ 
petition 
was 
dismissed 
vide 
order 
dated 
14.01.2020 by Single Bench of this Court. 
xvi. 
All this shows that no person including the 
private respondents was allotted land within the 
Revenue Estate of Mouza Murree Brewery 
through RL-II being Indian Migrants. 
xvii. 
The private respondents through C.M.No.404 of 
2020, moved in I.C.A No.9 of 2020, have 
produced RL-II No.1190 dated 10.12.1960 
pertaining to Nafisa(Nafees) Banu through her 
husband 
Khan 
Abdul 
Shafi 
Khan 
Barqi, 
Assistant Executive Officer NWR (North Western 
Estate Railway) and R.L-II No.1198 in the name of 
Khan Abdul Shafi Khan Barqi wherein he was 
not shown with his official position mentioned 

10 
C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
above. Perusal of these two RL-II shows that 
they were got attested from Naeem Akbar 
Sheikh, 
Oath 
Commissioner, 
Lahore. 
The 
private respondents have also produced copy of 
RL-II No.1190 pertaining to Nafisa (Nafees) Banu, 
predecessor of the private respondents, through 
C.M.No.1156 of 2024, moved in Crl.Org.No.44 of 
2021 which shows that they have obtained its 
copy on 13.10.1999 from Copying Agency of the 
office of Deputy Commissioner, Rawalpindi. 
Contrary to this, the Deputy Commissioner 
present in the Court has produced instructions 
issued by Maqbool Ahmad Sheikh, the then 
Member 
Revenue 
Board 
Punjab 
dated 
12.12.1984, according to which copy of RL-II 
shall not be issued to any party in any case. In 
these circumstances copy of RL-II No.1190 
obtained 
by 
the 
private 
respondents 
on 
13.10.1999 from copying agency of Deputy 
Commissioner Office, Rawalpindi is a fake and 
bogus document. 
xviii. 
Column No.4 of all these three copies of RL-II 
was left blank and detail required under the law 
regarding property left by Nafisa (Nafees) Banu 
and Khan Abdul Shafi Khan Barqi, predecessors 
of the private respondents in India with detail of 
village, Tehsil and District has not been 
mentioned which falsifies their plea of having 
verified their claims. Report dated 28.03.2018 
prepared by the Committee consisting of 
Assistant Commissioner  (City), Rawalpindi, 
Sub-Registrar (U-I), Rwp and NTO (HQ), Rwp 
reproduced above qua non-availability of RL-II of 

11 
C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
Murree Brewery wherein suit land is situated, 
shows that all these three copies of RL-II 
produced by private respondents, discussed 
above, are fake and bogus documents and were 
prepared through fraud and forgery just to grab 
State land situated within the heart of Murree 
having 
worth 
of 
billions 
of 
rupees. 
All 
officials/officers and the private respondents 
involved therein cannot be spared from their 
criminal liabilities. 
xix. 
It 
is 
not 
mentioned 
in 
the 
consolidated 
judgment dated 03.10.2000 that how much 
land was allotted to respondents. The private 
respondents have mentioned in para-2 of their 
W.P No.2290/2019 that their predecessors were 
allotted 
land 
measuring 
114K-07M. 
It 
is 
mentioned in para-10 of the judgment dated 
14.01.2020 passed in W.P No.2290/2019 that 
the private respondents were of the view that 
their entitlement is 116-Kanals. Perusal of fake 
RL-II 1190 pertaining to Nafisa(Nafees) Banu 
shows that she was allotted land measuring 
38K-15M and RL-II 1198 pertaining to Khan 
Abdul Shaafi Khan Barqi shows that he was 
allotted land measuring 43K-6M (total 82K-1M). All 
this shows that the private respondents having false 
claim are not certain even about their actual 
entitlement till today which negates their claim.  
xx. 
Above discussed facts suggest that the land of 
Mouza Murree Brewery could not have been 
allotted 
to 
the 
private 
respondents 
vide 
consolidated judgment dated 03.10.2000 passed 
by this Court in Settlement Revision Petitions 

12 
C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
Nos.30, 38 (relating to suit land) and 75 of 1972, 
rather this Court had no jurisdiction to pass 
consolidated judgment in their favour which has 
been obtained by misleading the Court against 
the record and suppressing the facts. It is void 
and per-incuriam judgment which cannot be 
implemented.  
xxi. 
We are also mindful that this consolidated 
judgment was challenged before the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan by the Chief Settlement and 
Rehabilitation Commissioner by filing Civil 
Appeals No.484 to 486 of 2002 which were 
dismissed on technical ground vide order dated 
13.12.2007 
reproduced 
in 
Para-9 
of 
this 
judgment.  
xxii. 
A void judgment is a court decision that has no 
legal power. It is like, it never happened. Any 
one affected by the such judgment can say, it is 
void even at belated stage. If an order/judgment 
is without jurisdiction and void, it need not be 
formally set aside and no question would 
therefore arise of holding that the matter cannot 
be considered on merits on account of any bar 
of limitation. The order/judgment being without 
jurisdiction is a nullity and does not require to 
be set aside in appeal. 
xxiii. 
It is settled by now that Revenue functionaries 
are not bound to implement the order/judgment 
which is void or per incuriam, coram non judice 
and passed without jurisdiction or obtained on 
the basis of forged, false, fake, fictitious and 
fabricated documents (as in present case). Reliance 
is placed on case “PROVINCE OF THE PUNJAB 

13 
C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
through Secretary Settlement and Rehabilitation 
Department, Lahore V. AKHTAR ALI KHAN and 
others.” (2007 SCMR 459).    
xxiv. 
It has been held in different cases of the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan as under:-  
(i) 
“MUHAMMAD 
SWALEH 
AND 
ANOTHER V. MESSRS UNITED 
GRAIN 
& 
FODDER 
AGENCIES” (PLD 1964 SC 
97) 
“It should be remembered that if an order 
be a nullity then every Court before whom 
it is brought is not only entitled, but 
bound to ignore it.” 
(ii) 
 “PROVINCE OF THE PUNJAB 
through 
Secretary, 
Health 
Department 
V. 
Dr.S.MUHAMMAD 
ZAFAR 
BUKHARI” 
(PLD 
1997 
SC 
351). Facts of this case are 
somewhat similar to the case 
in hand to the extent that in 
that case as well writ petition 
was 
allowed, 
ICA 
was 
withdrawn 
and 
CPLA 
was 
dismissed being time barred 
but 
judgment 
being 
void 
judgment 
was 
not 
implemented.   
 
13.  
The law is settled by now that an application u/s 
12 (2) of CPC can be decided without framing of issues 
and recording of evidence which is not obligatory for the 
Court. It is worth-mentioning that primarily it is the 
satisfaction of the Court either to frame the issues, record 
evidence or decide such applications as may deem fit and 
proper after considering the circumstances of each case. 
No yardstick can be fixed for adjudication of such 
application. It is correct that the determination of 
allegations of fraud and misrepresentation, usually 
involved investigation into the questions of fact but it is 
not in every case that the Court would be under obligation 
to frame issues, record evidence of the parties and follow 

14 
C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
the procedure prescribed for decision of the suit. If it was 
so, the purpose of providing the new remedy would be 
defeated. The matter is left to the satisfaction of the Court 
which has to regulate its proceedings and keeping in view 
the nature of the allegations in the application, may adopt 
such mode for its disposal, as in consonance with the 
justice. In present case, vide impugned  judgment dated 
21.10.2020, order for implementation of the void 
judgment was passed which (void judgment) has been 
obtained against fake and bogus RL-II as well as on false 
claim. Relevant authorities have also found that no record 
of RL-II pertaining to Mouza Murree Brewery is available 
in the record. No RL-II pertaining to Mouza Murree 
Brewery has been issued either to the private respondents 
or others.  
14.  
It is settled by now that if on the basis of a void 
order/judgment subsequent orders have been passed 
either by the same authority or by other authorities, the 
whole 
series 
of 
such 
orders, 
together 
with 
the 
superstructure of rights and obligations built upon them, 
must, unless some statute or principle of law recognizing 
as legal, the changed position of the parties is in 
operation, fall to the ground because such orders have as 
little legal foundation as the void order on which they are 
founded. Reliance is placed on case “Yousaf Ali V. 
Muhammad Aslam Zia and 2 others (PLD 1958 SC (Pak.) 
104). 
15.  
In these circumstances, in present case,  there 
exists no need to frame issues and to record evidence in 
instant C.M. (application u/s 12 (2) CPC) which is allowed, 
impugned judgment dated 21.10.2020 passed by this 
Court in I.C.A.No.09 of 2020 is hereby set-aside. 

15 
C.M.No.1160 of 2022  
           in  
I.C.A No.9 of 2020 
 
 
16.  
In the normal circumstances, if a decree is set-
aside  u/s 12 (2) CPC, the case is revived for decision on 
merits in accordance with law but, in the light of facts 
and circumstances of present case discussed above, no 
useful purpose would be served to hear I.C.A No.09 of 
2020 on merits against bogus RL-II which too is hereby 
dismissed. (2006 SCMR 12) “Sheikh Muhammad Sadiq 
Vs. Elahi Bakhsh and 2 others”.  
17.  
Lastly but importantly, public functionaries are 
custodians of public property; they must protect and 
safeguard the public property like a lioness guards her 
cubs. Even a slight lapse on behalf of the public 
functionaries in the stewardship of such sacred trust and 
public confidence, called for strictest accountability in the 
larger interest of justice and institutional building. In 
present case, State land having worth of billions of rupees 
situated in the heart of Murree District Murree is being 
grabbed by the private respondents in connivance with 
some of the officials/officers who have given positive 
reports in their favour against the record, who are not 
ignorable and liable to face criminal proceedings, we 
therefore, direct the Director General Anti-Corruption 
Establishment Punjab to probe the matter and proceed in 
accordance 
with 
law 
against 
all 
the 
delinquent 
officers/officials 
as 
well 
as 
against 
the 
private 
respondents, who are involved in this scam under the 
intimation to the Addl. Registrar (Judl.) of this Court.
