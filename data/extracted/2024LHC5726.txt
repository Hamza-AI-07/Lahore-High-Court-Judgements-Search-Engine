 This petition under Section 435 read with Section 439 
of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter 
referred to as Cr.P.C.) stems from order dated 20th 
November, 2024, whereby learned Judge Anti-Terrorism 
Court-I, Rawalpindi (hereinafter referred to as A.T.C.)  
proceeded to dismiss the petition under Section 265-K of 
Cr.P.C. moved by the petitioner, seeking acquittal, 
pending trail. 
2.  Facts forming background of this petition are that a 
case FIR No.708 dated 09th May, 2023 was registered at 
Police Station R.A. Bazar, Rawalpindi with regard to an 
incident relating to attack on General Headquarters, 
Rawalpindi against some renown leaders of a political 
party alongwith other accused. The petitioner was 
implicated in the case on the basis of statement of 
co-accused recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. In order 
to get his acquittal, the petitioner moved a petition under 
Section 265-C of Cr.P.C. before A.T.C. which was 
dismissed through the impugned order. 
3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the 
petitioner has committed no offence. He added that the 
petitioner has been involved in the case by the prosecution 
on account of political victimization. Learned counsel 
submitted that there is no probability of conviction of the

CRL. REVISION NO.327/2024 
petitioner and the trial before the A.T.C. would be mere 
futile exercise. It is argued with vehemence that the 
impugned order is not tenable under the law. 
4.  We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner at 
considerable length and perused the record. 
5.  The petitioner was arrayed as one of the perpetrators 
of the offence in the statement under Section 164 of 
Cr.P.C. of the co-accused, recorded before the Magistrate. 
The petitioner was sent before the A.T.C. to face the trial 
but at the very outset, he moved a petition under Section 
265-K of Cr.P.C., seeking his acquittal, which was turned 
down. We have noticed that after dismissal of the petition 
under Section 265-K of Cr.P.C., A.T.C. proceeded to 
frame charge against the petitioner to which he pleaded not 
guilty and claimed trial. There is no cavil that in terms of 
Section 265-K of Cr.P.C. a court is vested with the power 
to acquit an accused at any stage of the case if it considers 
that there is no probability of his conviction in the offence. 
6.  In order to adjudge the propriety of the impugned 
order, it would be apposite to first examine the object and 
scope of Sections 249-A and 265-K of Cr.P.C. In the 
recent past, scope of Sections 249-A and 265-K of Cr.P.C. 
came under discussion before the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan 
in 
the 
case 
of 
MODEL 
CUSTOMS 
COLLECTORATE, 
ISLAMABAD 
versus 
AAMIR 
MUMTAZ QURESHI (2022 SCMR 1861), wherein 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:- 
Under section 249-A, the Magistrate is empowered to acquit 
any accused on two grounds i.e. charge is groundless and 
there is no probability of conviction, whereas under section 
265-K, Cr.P.C., the court during the trial is empowered to 
acquit an accused, when there is no probability of conviction 
indicating that when there is no evidence on the record and 
even there is no remote probability of conviction and if there is 
remote probability of conviction then the court is required to 

3 
 
CRL. REVISION NO.327/2024 
record the evidence and then decide the case on evidence 
bought on record during the trial. From the above sections, it 
is also clear that application under sections 249-A and 265-K, 
Cr.P.C. can be filed or taken up for adjudication at any stage 
of proceeding of trial i.e. even before recording of prosecution 
evidence or during recording of evidence or when recording of 
evidence is over. Although there is no bar for an accused to 
file application under the said sections at any stage of 
proceeding of the trial, yet the fact and circumstance of the 
prosecution case will have to be kept in mind and if there is 
slight probability of conviction then of course, instead of 
deciding the said application should record the evidence and 
allow the case to be decided on its merit after appraising the 
evidence available on record. 
7.  Yet again, in the case of AMMAD YOUSAF versus The 
STATE and another (PLD 2024 Supreme Court 273), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan outlined the scope of above 
noted provisions in the following words:- 
3. The Code has granted an inherent jurisdiction by virtue of 
sections 249-A and 265-K to the trial courts, as the case may 
be, to acquit any or all accused at any stage of the judicial 
proceedings for reasons to be recorded, after providing an 
opportunity of hearing to the parties. The words "any stage" 
used in both the sections include the stages before or after 
framing of the charge or after recording of some evidence. 
Such power can only be exercised where the Court is of the 
opinion that no charge could be framed because of lack of 
jurisdiction; because the material available before it is 
insufficient for the purposes of constituting an offence; that if 
charge is framed, but the Court considers it to be groundless 
and to allow the prosecution to continue with the trial would 
amount to an abuse of process; or that in all circumstances, 
where there is no probability of conviction of the accused, even 
after a full- fledged trial. Thus, if circumstances for exercise of 
inherent powers exist, the Court must use such powers at any 
stage of the proceedings on its own or upon an application by 
the accused, provided that an opportunity of hearing is 
afforded to the parties before making any order. The power 
assigned to the Courts by the legislature is to avoid the abuse 
of process of the Court; to protect the integrity of the criminal 
justice system; to safeguard a person involved in the case from 
the agony of a purposeless, malicious, and frivolous criminal 
prosecution; or otherwise, to secure the ends of justice. The 
exercise of the inherent powers is mandatory in nature, 
therefore, any departure therefrom would be a violation of the 
substantive provisions of law and would prejudice the interests 
of the accused, which is an illegality. If the Court considers that 
the available material is sufficient to proceed with the trial and 
refuses to quash the judicial proceedings, it does not preclude 
the Court from exercising its inherent power subsequently 
after recording some evidence or surfacing any material for the 
purpose of quashing the proceedings. However, the exercise 
of such power by the Courts must be in exceptional 

4 
 
CRL. REVISION NO.327/2024 
circumstances, with great caution and by applying its mind 
judiciously. 
 
8.  After having an overview of the principles noted, 
hereinabove, it can safely be inferred that the powers of 
acquittal with the court embodied in Sections 249-A and 
265-K of Cr.P.C. can be exercised at any stage of the trial, 
if in the opinion of the court, there is no probability of the 
accused, being convicted of the offence but such powers 
cannot be exercised in an omnibus fashion. The court while 
proceeding in terms of above provisions of law, first has to 
assure itself that in all probabilities, there is no chance of 
conviction of the accused. In simple words, we can say that 
for the purpose of invoking the powers either under Section 
249-A or Section 265-K of Cr.P.C., the approach of the 
court should neither be inventive nor adventurous, instead 
facts of the case itself require and persuade the court to 
exercise such powers so as to save the accused from the 
agony of protracted and futile trial. The petitioner though 
has invoked the powers of the A.T.C. by moving a petition 
under 
Section 
265-K 
of 
Cr.P.C. 
but 
remained 
unsuccessful. As we have already noted, hereinabove, that 
after dismissal of petition under Section 265-K of Cr.P.C., 
the petitioner has been confronted with charge sheet, we 
feel no cavil to observe that at this initial stage, it would 
not be apt for us to make any comment upon worth and 
credence of statement of the co-accused recorded under 
Section 164 of Cr.P.C. as it may cause prejudice to any of 
the side before the trial court. In our considered opinion, 
acquittal of the petitioner in terms of Section 265-K of 
Cr.P.C. in the facts and circumstances of the case, at this 
early stage, would amount to stifle the proceedings before 
the trial court, who already refused to exercise its powers 
in favour of the petitioner. Moreover, after dismissal of 

5 
 
CRL. REVISION NO.327/2024 
petition under Section 265-K of Cr.P.C., A.T.C. 
proceeded to frame charge against the petitioner.  
9.  We, thus, are of the unanimous view that A.T.C. did 
not commit any illegality or perversity while dismissing the 
petition under Section 265-K of Cr.P.C. moved by the 
petitioner. Resultantly, this petition, being devoid of any 
merits, is dismissed in limine. 
10.  Before parting, we may observe that the petitioner 
would be at liberty to move the A.T.C. at any subsequent 
stage of the trial even in the process of recording of 
evidence and if any such fresh application is moved by the 
petitioner, that shall be proceeded with and decide strictly 
in accordance with law.
