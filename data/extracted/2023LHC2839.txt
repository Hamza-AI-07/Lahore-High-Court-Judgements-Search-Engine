Date of hearing 
25.05.2023 
Petitioner By: 
Ch. Abdul Sattar Ghumman, Advocate  
Respondents By: Sh. Shahzad Ahmed Pasha, Advocate for 
respondents.  
Mr. Ijaz Rehmat Basra, Asst. Attorney General.  
 
 
Faisal Zaman Khan, J:- Through this petition petitioner seeks 
a direction to the respondents to allow her family pension. 
2. 
Succinctly, the facts of the case are that real brother of the 
petitioner namely Sher Afzal (deceased), who had been working with 
the respondent-department as Head Clerk, expired on 30.05.2005, 
whereafter, petitioner applied for a succession certificate for seeking 
family pension of the deceased brother, which was allowed vide order 
dated 26.04.2011. Subsequently, time and again petitioner has been 
approaching the respondents for seeking family pension, however, the 
needful has not been done, therefore, this petition. 
3. 
Report and parawise comments were filed by the respondents 
denying the claim of the petitioner.  
4. 
In the above backdrop, learned counsel for the petitioner submits 
that under Rule 4.10 of the West Pakistan Civil Services Pension 
Rules, 1963 (Rules) petitioner being unmarried sister of the deceased 

W.P.No.15570 of 2022 
2 
should be allowed family pension and in this regard a succession 
certificate has also been issued by the civil court of competent 
jurisdiction. 
5. 
Replying to the above, learned counsel for the respondents 
submits that petitioner obtained succession certificate by concealing 
material facts for the reason that while applying for issuance of 
succession certificate it was asserted by the petitioner that she is the 
sole legal heir of the deceased, whereas, the deceased was succeeded 
by two sons. Further submits that under the Rules petitioner is not 
entitled to any pension.  
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
7. 
From the perusal of the available record, it transpires that for 
seeking family pension of the deceased, petitioner applied for issuance 
of succession certificate, which vide order dated 26.04.2011 was 
granted to her by the civil court of competent jurisdiction and she was 
held entitled to receive the family pension. Thereafter, petitioner filed a 
contempt petition against the respondents for non-compliance of the 
said order, which was disposed of vide order dated 27.02.2020 with the 
observation that petitioner is entitled to family pension of her deceased 
brother and a direction was issued to the respondent to pay the family 
pension, whereafter, an application for setting aside/revocation of the 
succession certificate was filed by the respondents, which was 
dismissed vide order dated 05.12.2020. Feeling aggrieved of orders 
dated 27.02.2020 and 05.12.2020, two civil revisions were filed by the 
respondents, which were dismissed vide orders dated 12.06.2021, 
however, the available record would show that the said orders were not 
assailed by the respondents before any court or fora, therefore, the 
same have attained finality. 
8. 
Keeping in view the above factual matrix the moot point, which 
requires determination by this Court is that as to whether petitioner 
being an unmarried sister of the deceased is entitled to family pension.

9. 
For resolving the above proposition, it is expedient to reproduce 
Rule 4.10 of the Rules, which is as under: 
“4.10. (I) Family for the purpose of payment of family pension shall 
be as defined in sub-rule(I) of rule 4.7. It shall also include the 
Government servants relative mentioned in clause (d) of rule 4.8.  
(2) (A) A family pension sanctioned under this section shall be 
allowed as under:-  
(i) (a) To the widow of the deceased; if the deceased is a male 
Government servant or to the husband, if the deceased is a female 
Government servant,  
(b) If the Government servant had more than one wife, and the 
number of his surviving widows and children does not exceed 4, the 
pension shall be divided equally among the surviving widows and 
eligible children. If the number of surviving widows and children 
together is more than 4, the pension shall be divided in the 
following manner, viz;: each surviving widow shall get 1/4th of the 
pension and the balance (if any) shall be divided equally among the 
surviving eligible children. Distribution in the above manner shall 
also take place whenever the Government servant leaves behind 
surviving children of a wife that has predeceased him in addition to 
the widow and her children, if any  
(c) In the case of a female Government servant leaving behind 
children from a former marriage in addition to her husband and 
children by her surviving husband, the amount of pension shall be 
divided equally among the husband and all eligible children. In 
case the total number of beneficiaries exceeds four, the husband 
shall be allowed 1/4th of the pension and the remaining amount 
distributed equally among the eligible children.  
(ii) Failing a widow or husband as the case may be the pension 
shall be divided equal among the surviving sons not above 24 years 
and unmarried daughters.  
Note.- In working out the share of the various heirs under sub-

paisa:-  
(iii) Failing (i) and(ii), to the eldest widowed daughter.  
(iv), Failing (i) to (iii), to the eldest widow of a deceased son of the 
Government servant.

period for which it is admissible on death or marriage of the 
recipient or on account of other causes, to persons falling under 
sub-clause (A) (i) and (ii) of sub-rule (2) above, the amount shall be 
granted to other recipients in equal shares.  
(b) If a family pension awarded under this section other than that 
mentioned in clause (A) (i) or (ii) of sub-rule (2) of this rule ceases 
to be payable before the expiry of the period upto which it is

every grant of a family pension under this section.

10. 
A reading of the above provision stipulates that where a civil 
servant, who was entitled to receive or has been receiving pensionary 
benefits, 
expires, 
after 
his 
demise, 
his 
pension 
will 
be 
received/transferred to his family members, a complete chart/resume 
according to their preferential right has been given in this Rule. 
11. 
Placing the afore-noted provision of law in juxtaposition with 
the facts of the present case, it has surfaced that since no other legal 
heir of the deceased, who is entitled to receive the family pension was 
available thus in view of Rule 4.10(2)(B)(iv) of the Rules, petitioner is 
entitled to receive the family pension, thus, refusal of the respondents 
to allow the family pension to her, is not only illegal, but is also an act 
of cruelty on their part, especially so when the question of succession 
and the payment of pension has already been resolved by the court of 
competent jurisdiction by way of issuing a succession certificate, 
which has attained finality after dismissal of civil revision filed by the 
respondents. 
12. 
As regards the objection of the learned counsel for the 
respondents that petitioner is not entitled to family pension for the 
reason that the deceased was succeeded by his two sons, the same is 
not tenable for the reason that both the sons admittedly are more than 
24 years of age thus keeping in view Rule 4.10(2)(A)(ii) of the Rules 
they are disentitled to receive family pension. Moreover, reliance of 
the learned counsel for the respondents on Rule 4.7 and 4.8 to argue 
that since petitioner was not nominated by the deceased to receive 
family pension is misplaced for the reason that the said provisions deal 
with payment of gratuity and for that concept of “nomination” is 
available, whereas, in Rule 4.10 (applicable in the present case), which 
specifically deal with family pension nomination by the deceased 
employee for receiving family pension is not required. Moreover, 
while promulgating Rule 4.10, the competent authority has in fact 
added certain categories of the relatives to the definition of family as 

W.P.No.15570 of 2022 
6 
defined in Rules 4.7 and 4.8, only for the payment of family pension 
(and not gratuity) and, thus, has amplified and extended the definition. 
13. 
For what has been discussed above, this petition is allowed, as a 
sequel to which respondents are directed to pay the family pension of 
the deceased to the petitioner from the date of death of the deceased. 
The payment shall be made within a period of 30 days of the receipt of 
a certified copy of this judgment.
