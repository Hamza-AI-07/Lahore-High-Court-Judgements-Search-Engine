Shahid Karim, J:-. This constitutional petition brings a 
challenge to the definition of ‘child’ contained in the Child 
Marrige Restraint Act, 1929 (1929 Act) as amended and 
substituted by the Punjab Child Marriage Restraint 
(Amendment) Act, 2015.  In particular, section 2(a) and (b) 
of the 1929 Act have been sought to be declared 
unconstitutional on the ground that they offend the equality 
clause in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (The Constitution). 
2. 
Section 2(a) and (b) of the 1929 Act provide that: 
“2(a)  “child” means a person who, if a male, is under 
eighteen years of age, and if a female, is under sisteen years 
of age; 
 
(b) 
“child marriage” means a marriage to which either 
of the contracting parties is a child.” 
 
3. 
It can be seen that definition of ‘child’ given in the 
above definition means a person who if a male is under 18 
years of age and if a female is under 16 years of age and the 
punishments have been accordingly given in section 4 of the 
Act.  In other Provinces such as Sindh, The Sindh Child 
Marriage Restraint Act, 2013 has been promulgated where 
the definition of a ‘minor’ has been done away with and a

person can either be a child or a major.  The genders have 
also been treated equally.  
Child Marriage: 
4. 
The learned counsel for the petitioner reiterated the 
grounds taken in the petition and the arguments in this Court 
centred on the apparent distinction drawn on the basis of 
gender.  These arguments shall be dealt with during the 
course of this opinion.  learned Advocate General filed a 
brief which makes an interesting reading.  The brief 
eruditely and in a scholarly manner alludes to the premise on 
which the difference may be justified.  Reference has also 
been made to Islamic jurisprudence regarding age of puberty 
as the traditional interpretative toolkit.  Doubtless, medical 
science, too, supports the notion of a female attaining 
puberty at an age which materially differs from a male.  But 
that does not necessarily lead to granting a license in the 
hands of a parent or guardian to marry off a female child.  
The nuanced concepts of puberty and age of majority are not 
required to be invoked here. 
5. 
In any enquiry, the first step is to ask the right question.  
The resolution of this wrinkle does not entail a debate 
regarding age of puberty.  There may not be much sunlight 
between our opinions on this aspect.  The right question to 
ask is whether notwithstanding the appearance of signs of 
puberty differently in males and females, the Government is 
empowered to prescribe a minimum age for marriage or not?  
For, that is what the 1929 Act seeks to achieve.  If this were 
not the case, the definition of child would have had relation 
to age of puberty and not ages determined reflexively or 
randomly.  Otherwise there are no manageable standards for 
assigning ages of sixteen and eighteen for female and male 
respectively.  In my opinion, there is no prohibition in the 
Constitution on prescribing a minimum threshold for 
marriage and therefore to criminalise child marriage.  The 
theme of the 1929 Act is to “restrain the solemnization of 
child marriage.”  That purpose has been muddled by 
providing different ages for males and females for which 
there is no intelligible criteria.  There may be a myriad of 

W.P No.32798 of 2023 
 
3
factors considered by the legislature while enacting the law.  
Some of them have been narrated by the learned Advocate 
General to state that: 
There is no caveat to the fact that child marriages constitute a 
violation of the fundamental rights of children. In Pakistan, 
many children are victims of child marriage and it is also a 
matter of record that the burden of child marriage is 
disproportionately borne by girls as opposed to boys. Early 
marriage excludes children from education and makes them 
vulnerable to various health complications. As many as 21% 
of girls  are married before the age of 18 years and 3% 
before the age of 15 years in Pakistan according to UNICEF 
database 2016, based on Demographic Health Survey of 
Pakistan 2012-2013. Recent Demographic Health Survey of 
Pakistan (2017-2018), report that although on an average the 
age of marriage of girls is increasing but a deeper analysis of 
the data shows that child marriage at the age of 15 years has 
increased from 1.6 per cent to 1.8 percent. 
 Child marriage deprives a child of the right to 
education.  
 In Pakistan, Pregnancy and childbirth related 
complications are the main causes of death for 
mothers aged 15 to 19. 
 Child Marriage further perpetuates the cycle of 
poverty and the impact of inter-generational cycle of 
mal-nutrition.  
 
6. 
These are formidable reasons to compel a Government 
to put a restraint on child marriage.  The extract set out 
above makes a compelling case based on physiological and 
sociological factors for the executive to step up and take 
effective measures to counter the debilitating effect of child 
marriage.  It was a data-driven exercise based on pragmatic 
considerations to ensure a healthy society.  It is an attempt to 
tap into the potential of more than half the population and 
pivots the mother to the centre of the debate.  To the above, 
population control may also be added.  In a nub, the purpose 
of law is anchored primarily in social economic and 
educational factors rather than religious.  We, as a nation, 
woefully lag behind in all major indicators and half of our 
population cannot be lost to child-bearing at an early age 
while its potential remains untapped.  Equal opportunities 
for females means equal restraint on marriage as the males.  
It is thus a fallacy to assume that the discourse is coloured 
by some underlying notions unrelated to the real purpose 
that permeates the law of child marriage.

7. 
The concept can also be culled out of Article 35 of the 
Constitution which provides: 
“35. The State shall protect the marriage, the family, the 
mother and the child. 
 
8. 
This principle of policy obliges the State to protect 
marriage, the family, the mother and the child.  The 1929 
Act (and its amendments) is a step towards fulfilment of 
duty by the State under Article 35.  It specifically mentions 
the mother and not the father.  It is of crucial importance ‘to 
protect marriage, the family, the mother and the child’ to put 
a restraint on child marriage yet the centre of the family, the 
mother, has been grossly discriminated which undermines 
the cogency of the constitutional scheme.  It is essential for 
the protection of family (with the mother and the child as its 
more important elements) to protect a female from being 
subjected to child marriage.  The mandate of Article 35 was 
not lost on the legislature while enacting the 1929 Act.  But, 
for some reason which cannot be discerned, unmistakable 
partisan slant has muddled the clear stream of policy 
objectives animating the 2015 amendments.  The difference 
in ages in the definition of ‘child’ was left unchanged in the 
2015 amendments, which does not comport with the 
mandate of Article 25.   
9. 
Article 25 of the Constitution provides that: 
25. (1) All citizens are equal before law and are entitled to 
equal protection of law. 
 
(2) There shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex . 
 
 (3) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from 
making any special provision for the protection of women 
and children. 
 
10. The above article in the Constitution states, without 
equivocation, that “there shall no discrimination on the basis 
of sex”, and the State is only permitted to make special 
provision for the protection of women and children.  The 
definition of ‘child’ in the 1929 Act while making a 
distinction on the basis of age, is not based on an intelligible 
criteria having nexus with the object of the law.  The 
definition is indeed a special provision for the protection of 

W.P No.32798 of 2023

women but in the process it tends to afford greater 
protection to males by keeping their age of marriage higher 
than females.  Clause (3) of Article 25 is an instance of 
affirmative action, a concept of American constitutional law 
and introduced in our Constitution through this provision.  I 
have no doubt in my mind that the definition of child, in its 
present form, in 1929 Act is discriminatory. 
11. In sum, the words in section 2(a) viz. “if a male ….and 
if a female is under sixteen years of age” being 
unconstitutional are held to be without lawful authority and 
of no legal effect.  They are struck down. 
12. The Govt. of Punjab (its relevant department) is 
directed to issue the revised version of 1929 Act (based on 
this judgment) within the next fifteen days and shall also 
upload that version on its website for information.
