Objection Case 
 
The petitioner has filed instant constitutional 
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 by calling in question order 
dated 06.11.2025 passed by Additional District Judge, 
Sheikhupura, whereby right of the petitioner to cross 
examine witnesses of respondent No.2 has been closed 
for his failure to comply with the condition mentioned in 
the leave granting order.   
2. 
The office has raised the objection at Serial No.45 
of the objection sheet to avail proper remedy i.e. Civil 
Revision.   
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner has contested 
the said objection by referring to judgment reported as 
Habib Bank Limited, Karachi vs. Zaki Muhammad 
Siddiquie and 2 others (PLD 1979 Karachi 129), 
wherein against a leave granting order, civil revision was 
held to be not maintainable and further relies upon the 
judgment reported as Hafiz Muhammad Owais vs. Addl: 
District Judge, etc (2024 CLC 577) to contend that 
against similar order, the petitioner in an earlier round of 

2 
D. No. 151940 of 2025   
Dated: 18.11.2025 
litigation was allowed to file a constitutional petition by 
over-ruling the office objection.  
4. 
Perusal of Section 115 CPC shows that remedy of 
civil revision is available against any order, appeal 
where-against is not available under the law.  Section 
115(1) CPC is reproduced below for ready reference: 
“115. Revision.—(1) The High Court may call for 
the record of any case which has been decided by 
any Court subordinate to such High Court and in 
which no appeal lies thereto, and if such 
subordinate Court appears— 
(a) to have exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it 
by law, or 
(b) to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction so 
vested, or 
(c) to have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction 
illegally or with material irregularity, the High 
Court may make such order in the case as it thinks 
fit: 
Provided that, where a person makes an 
application under this subsection, he shall, in 
support of such application, furnish copies of the 
pleadings, documents and order of the subordinate 
Court and the High Court shall, except for reasons 
to be recorded, dispose of such application without 
calling for the record of the subordinate Court. 
Provided further that the subordinate court shall 
provide copies of the documents to a person within 
three days of the decision, and the High Court 
shall dispose of such application within six 
months. 
……….” 
5. 
In the present case, respondent No.2 had filed a 
suit under Order XXXVII CPC for recovery of 
Rs.1,20,00,000/- against the petitioner which was 
contested by him and vide order dated 01.02.2025, 
learned Additional District Judge, Sheikhupura was 
pleased to grant leave to defend to the petitioner subject 
to furnishing of the surety bonds equivalent to the 
amount claimed in the suit i.e. Rs.1,20,00,000/-, 
however, as said condition was not complied with by the 

3 
D. No. 151940 of 2025   
Dated: 18.11.2025 
petitioner, despite availing various opportunities, hence 
the said order was recalled on 16.04.2025, where-after 
the petitioner on 12.07.2025 submitted an application 
before the trial court seeking permission to cross examine 
witnesses of respondent No.2.  The said application has 
been dismissed through the impugned order dated 
06.11.2025, the operative part of which is reproduced 
below: 
 “Perusal 
of 
record 
reveals 
that 
respondent/plaintiff filed suit u/o XXXVII of CPC 
against the applicant/defendant who put his 
appearance before the court and submitted 
application for leave to defend before learned 
predecessor of this court on 18.01.2025 which was 
allowed after hearing both the parties vide order 
dated 01.02.2025 but defendant remain failed to 
submit surety bond as per direction of learned 
predecessor of this court due to which order dated 
01.02.2025 was recalled and application for leave 
to defend was dismissed vide order dated 
16.04.2025.  In the instant case the leave granting 
order dated 01.02.2025 was conditional in nature 
and due to failure of the applicant/defendant to 
fulfill the condition of submission of surety bond 
the same has already been recalled by learned 
predecessor of this court vide order dated 
16.04.2025.  Although learned counsel for the 
applicant/defendant has pointed out that such 
order has been assailed before the Hon’ble Lahore 
High Court, Lahore through writ petition 
No.24536/2025 titled “Waqar Ahmad Vs. learned 
Additional District Judge, Sheikhupura etc” but no 
injunctive order has been produced before this 
court.  Subsequently, plaintiff’s evidence was 
completed and learned counsel for the plaintiff has 
already closed the oral as well as documentary 
evidence and case was fixed for final arguments.  
At this belated stage instant application u/s 151 of 
CPC has been filed by the applicant/defendant for 
permission to cross examine the plaintiff’s 
witnesses.  Since leave to defend refusal order 
dated 16.04.2025 is still in field and no injunctive 
order 
has 
been 
produced 
by 
the 
applicant/defendant before the court, hence leave 
to defend refusal order is being still in field, 

4 
D. No. 151940 of 2025   
Dated: 18.11.2025 
therefore, applicant/defendant is debarred from 
joining further proceedings in the suit.  Hence, this 
application is not maintainable in the present 
scenario.”   
 
6. 
No appeal is maintainable against said order, 
therefore, in terms of Section 115(1) CPC ordinarily a 
revision petition is to be filed against such an order.  
However, petitioner contends that no revision is available 
on the basis of two judgments referred above, hence, the 
said objection of the petitioner against maintainability of 
revision petition is being addressed.   
7. 
In PLD 1979 Karachi 129 (Supra) unconditional 
leave to defend the suit under Order XXXVII Rule 1 
CPC was granted to the respondent-defendant which was 
challenged 
by 
petitioner-plaintiff-bank 
before 
the 
revisional court through civil revision and the court while 
addressing the question had reached the conclusion that 
civil revision could only be exercised on the basis of 
three grounds and none of the same was available in the 
said case to entertain the same and said court never 
concluded that civil revision was not maintainable at all 
and that constitutional petition should have been filed.  
The operative part of the said judgment reproduced 
before: 
“4. Jurisdiction under section 115 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure is of a limited nature and can be 
invoked only when it is shown that the subordinate 
Court has-  
(i) 
exercised 
jurisdiction 
not 
vested in it by law, or  
(ii) 
failed to exercise a jurisdiction 
so vested, or  
(iii) acted in the exercise of its 
jurisdiction illegally or with material 
irregularity.  
There can be no two opinions that the 
District Judge had the jurisdiction to grant 
leave, conditionally or otherwise. The 

5 
D. No. 151940 of 2025   
Dated: 18.11.2025 
exercise of such power, even if erroneous 
would not attract the provisions of section 
115 of the Code of Civil Procedure as far as 
the first clause of the said section is 
concerned. Normally absence of jurisdiction 
connotes an absence of power to deal with a 
particular case or exercise of powers in 
excess of powers conferred by law. Since 
Court has the power to grant leave or to 
refuse leave it cannot be said that the order 
is one without jurisdiction. The next 
question is whether the jurisdiction has been 
exercised 
illegally 
or 
with 
material 
irregularity. Whether an order of a Court 
proceeds on illegality or with material 
irregularity, the question would always 
depend upon the provisions of law that have 
been disregarded. Often times the adoption 
of a precisely prohibited course is construed 
as an illegality. Obviously this is not so in 
the instant case. It then remains to be seen 
whether the District Judge acted with 
material irregularity. The words "material 
irregularity" 
have 
come 
up 
for 
consideration by the superior Courts of this 
country and a fair summary of the decisions 
would indicate that a Court would be said to 
have acted with material irregularity when it 
commits an error of procedure which may 
affect the ultimate decision in the case. The 
illegality must be in the manner of arriving 
at a decision as distinct from arriving at a 
conclusion. If a Court has jurisdiction, its 
conclusion whether on a matter of law or 
fact, cannot be questioned in revision, unless 
such conclusions affect the decision of a 
case. The mere adoption of an irregular 
mode would not attract section 115, C. P. C. 
If authorities are wanted for the proposition 
reference may be made to the cases reported 
in PLD 1964 SC 97, PLD 1969 Lah. 951 
and PLD 1963 Kar. 551.” 
 
8. 
Consequently, 
reliance 
upon 
the 
said 
judgment is of no avail to the petitioner.  As 
regards the judgment reported as 2024 CLC 
577(Supra), the matter in issue in the said case was 

6 
D. No. 151940 of 2025   
Dated: 18.11.2025 
an interlocutory application for grant of interim 
relief during the pendency of application for 
setting-aside ex-parte decree, which was still 
pending, the court has required the petitioner 
therein to deposit the bank guarantee and surety 
bond for ad-interim suspension of the impugned 
ex-parte decree which was held to be not a final 
challengeable order or a case decided in terms of 
Section 115 CPC for the revision petition against 
the same to be maintainable and it was held that 
question relating to maintainability of writ petition 
in the alternate would be decided on the judicial 
side, hence, said judgment is also distinguished on 
the basis of facts and not applicable to the case of 
the petitioner.   
9. 
In the present case, right of the petitioner to 
cross examine the PWs of respondent No.2 has 
been declined by dismissing his application.  This 
is a final order as regards the decision of said 
application and case decided in terms of Section 
115 CPC, therefore, could be called in question 
through revision petition and while hearing the 
said revision on merits, the question whether the 
matter falls within the three grounds provided for 
exercise of civil revision or not would be decided 
on its own merits in accordance with law.   
10. 
For what has been discussed above, the 
office objection is accordingly sustained.
