JAWAD HASSAN, J. This constitutional petition under 
Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973 (the “Constitution”) calls in question the vires of judgment and 
decree dated 19.12.2023, whereby Additional District Judge, 
Rawalpindi, while dismissing the appeal filed by the Petitioner 
affirmed the judgment and decree dated 06.03.2023 passed by Judge 
Family Court, Rawalpindi. These concurrent findings of fact have 
been assailed through this constitutional petition.  
2. 
Precisely the facts necessary for adjudication of instant petition 
are that the Respondent No.1 instituted a suit for recovery of 
maintenance, dowry articles and delivery expenses before the Judge 
Family Court, wherein the Petitioner was arrayed as defendant. The 
Petitioner contested the suit by filing a written statement, wherein he 
controverted the assertions contained in the plaint. From the divergent 
pleadings of the parties, the Judge Family Court, Rawalpindi framed 
the necessary issues to the following effect: 
ISSUES 
i. 
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get a decree for 
recovery of maintenance allowance? If yes, at

3. 
After framing of issues and recording of oral and documentary 
evidence adduced by both the parties, suit was decreed by the Judge 
Family Court, Rawalpindi vide judgment dated 06.03.2023 holding 
the Respondent No.1 entitled to recover Rs.10,000/- per month as 
maintenance for period of her Iddat. She was also held entitled to 
recover delivery expenses of Rs.40,000/-, whereas the issue with 
regard to dowry article became redundant as she had received all 
dowry articles. While the minors were held entitled to recover 
Rs.10,000/- per month each from 30.05.2020 till their legal 
entitlement with 10% annual increase. The Petitioner, feeling 
dissatisfied from the said judgment and decree, preferred an appeal 
before the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, but same 
was dismissed.  
4. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner inter alia contends that 
impugned judgments and decrees are result of mis-reading and  
non-reading of material available on record; that the Courts below 
have awarded maintenance allowance to the Respondent No.1 and 
minors at exorbitant rate by ignoring his financial status which he is 
unable to pay; that the Petitioner produced his salary slip (Exh.D-3/1) 
for the purpose of determination of his source of income, but the same 
has not been taken into consideration.  
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for Respondent No.1 contended 
that the impugned judgments have been passed after taking into 

W.P.Nos.370 of 2024 
 
       3 
 
consideration all aspects of the matter in dispute and, as such, do not 
suffer from any error or material irregularity. 
6. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties 
and perused the record.  
7. 
It is an established principle that findings on fact recorded by a 
competent court in exercise of lawful jurisdiction cannot be agitated 
by invoking writ jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution 
unless the same suffer from any legal infirmity, jurisdictional error or 
perversity causing serious miscarriage of justice. 
8. 
At the outset, learned counsel for the Petitioner stated that the 
Petitioner does not press this petition to the extent of claims of the 
Respondent No.1 viz. recovery of dowry articles and delivery 
expenses, however; he is only aggrieved of by the rate of maintenance 
exorbitantly awarded by the Courts below without keeping in 
consideration monthly earnings established and proved on behalf of 
the Petitioner. In this view of the matter, the impugned judgments and 
decrees to the extent of dowry articles and delivery expenses are 
maintained.  
9. 
The Respondent No.1 in her suit claimed maintenance 
allowance for each minor @ Rs.20,000/- and alleged that monthly 
income of the Petitioner is Rs.150,000/-, including income from his 
salary and business. The Respondent No.1 appeared as PW-1 and 
admitted it to be correct in her cross-examination that she does not 
have salary slip of the Petitioner and also no proof of his business. 
While the Petitioner appeared as DW-1 and took stance in his 
affidavit Exh.D2 that he earns Rs.18,299/- per month and in order to 
establish and controvert stance of the Respondent No.1, he produced 
his salary slip Exh.D-3/1 of KPMG as well as copy of letter from 
KMPG to the Manager Askari Bank Limited Exh.D-3/2 requesting to 
allow the Petitioner to open salary account. 
10. 
So far as matter of obligation of husband/father regarding 
providing maintenance allowance to legally wedded wife and 
children is concerned, a husband is under legal, moral and religious 

W.P.Nos.370 of 2024 
 
       4 
 
obligation to maintain his legally wedded wife. Section 272 of 
Mohammdan Law by Mullah provides obligation of a husband to 
maintain his wife with certain conditions. Section 278 postulates 
that if a husband refuses to maintain his wife, she may sue for 
maintenance. Hence, it is the obligation of husband to pay Nafqa 
or maintenance, if construed in accordance with the principles as 
laid down in "HIDAYA" translated by Charles Hamilton in 
Chapter XV such as "Nafqa", in the language of law, signifies all 
those things which are necessary to support of life, such as food, 
clothes and lodging. In case in hand, the courts below have held the 
Petitioner obliged to pay maintenance allowance of the Respondent 
No.1, which by no means is in deviation to law and sharia.  
11. 
Likewise, it cannot be denied at all that, in Islamic law, a 
father is under legal, moral and religious obligation to maintain his 
children till the age specified by law/sharia and it shall not be out 
of context to mention here that his such obligation originates from 
esteemed dictates of Holy Quran reading as follows: 
"And clothing and maintenance must be borne by the 
father in a fair manner." [AL-BAQARAH, 233]. 
12. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed in "HUMAYUN 
HASSAN versus ARSIAN HUMAYUN and another" (PLD 2013 SC 
557) that: 
“4. … according to section 369 of the 
Muhammadan 
Law 
by 
D.F. 
Mullah, 
maintenance means and includes food, 
raiment and lodging. … the same jurist in 
section 370 of the book has elucidated the 
liability of the father to pay the maintenance 
to his children as follows:- 
"370. 
Maintenance 
of 
children 
and 
grandchildren.---(1) A father is bound to 
maintain his sons until they have attained 
the age of puberty. He is also bound to 
maintain his daughters until they are 
married. But he is not bound to maintain his 
adult sons unless they are disabled by 
infirmity or disease. The fact that the 
children are in the custody of their mother 

W.P.Nos.370 of 2024 
 
       5 
 
during their infancy (section 352) does not 
relieve the father from the obligation of 
maintaining them. But the father is not 
bound to maintain a child who is capable of 
being maintained out of his or her own 
property. 
(2) If the father is poor, and in capable of 
earning by his own labour, the mother, if she 
is in easy circumstances, is bound to 
maintain her children as the father would 
be. 
(3) If the father is poor and infirm, and the 
mother also is poor, the obligation to 
maintain 
the 
children 
lies 
on 
the 
grandfather, provided he is in easy 
circumstances." 
13. 
Father’s said obligation to maintain his children has 
repeatedly been recognized, emphasized and elaborated by the 
Superior Courts of the country, one instance whereof is case titled 
"SYEDA FARHAT JAHAN versus SYED IQBAL HUSSAIN RIZVI 
and another" (2010 YLR 3275), wherein it has held that "it is the 
legal and moral duty of the father of minor children to keep 
maintaining them he being the natural guardian till they attain the 
age of majority. No excuse, big or small can absolve the father 
from his duty of maintaining his minor children which duty has 
been ordained on him through divine revelation of Allah 
Almighty." In the same context, the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
held in the case "Humayun Hassan” supra that "There can be no 
cavil with the proposition that the maintenance issue(s), in 
relation to Muslim relatives shall be governed and regulated by 
the principles/injunctions of Islam i.e. as per the personal law of 
the parties. In this context, according to section 369 of the 
Muhammadan Law by D.F. Mullah, maintenance means and 
includes food, raiment and lodging. However, it may be observed 
that from the very language of the above section, such definition 
is neither conclusive nor exhaustive, and in our view it 
undoubtedly has a wider connotation and should be given an 
extended meaning, for the purposes of meeting and catering for 

W.P.Nos.370 of 2024 
 
       6 
 
the present days social, physical, mental growth, upbringing and 
wellbeing of the minor, keeping in mind the status of the family, 
the norms of the society and his educational requirement, which 
has now attained utmost importance; but obviously corresponding 
to and commensurating with the means and the capacity of the 
father to pay." 
14. 
Hence a father is obligated to maintain his children and a 
reasonable standard must be assumed for determining quantum of 
their maintenance allowance. It goes without saying that the court 
while considering the quantum of maintenance will take into 
consideration the fundamentals of the minors education, status, 
general expenses. The court must also take into consideration 
reasonable probability of obtaining education and the ability to take 
care of the minors in a stable, safe and healthy environment. 
Without due consideration of all these factors, the court cannot 
conclude positively the quantum of maintenance. There is no hard 
and fast formula for determining quantum of maintenance and the 
main consideration for the Court is the ability of the father to 
maintain the minors. This way merely stating that he is short of 
resources will not discharge him of his obligation. The basic 
objective for determining maintenance is to ensure that in all 
probability the minors are maintained by the father in dignified 
manner with reasonable comfort and that the mother of the child is 
not left to bear the burden of taking care of the minors. Quantum of 
maintenance requires due consideration of all factors on the basis of 
which the court can determine the actual need of the minor. In this 
regard, it is important for the court to keep in consideration the 
expenses incurred or likely to be incurred on the minors. Yet for the 
purpose of maintenance it is the obligation of the father to fulfill 
needs of his kids. Reliance is placed on “NAZIA BIBI and others 
versus ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, FEROZEWALA and 
others” (PLD 2018 Lahore 916). 

W.P.Nos.370 of 2024 
 
       7 
 
15. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the Respondent No.1 was 
unable to procure and bring on record salary slip of the Petitioner, 
he himself was obliged to bring on record reliable and trustworthy 
record/documents disclosing his monthly salary as is desired in 
the case of "MUHAMMAD ASIM and others versus Mst. SAMRO 
BEGUM and others" (PLD 2018 SC 819), wherein it has been 
observed that “Where a husband is required to maintain his wife, 
former wife during her iddat period or child and is required to 
pay maintenance, including the arrears of maintenance, his 
present and past earnings must be disclosed by him, because his 
financial status determines the amount of maintenance that should 
be awarded. In case of non-disclosure an adverse inference can 
be drawn against him. … his conduct further betrays that he does 
not want to be fair and has unnecessarily embroiled his former 
wife and child in needless litigation. …..” 
16. 
In this case, the Petitioner though has produced in evidence his 
alleged salary slip of KPMG Exh.D-3/1, but said salary slip by no 
means qualify standards to attain trustworthy status for reliance on 
certain counts, one that it does not conform with minimum standards 
of wages and; the second that it is a document handed out and 
produced by the Petitioner himself, which from the face of it appears 
to be a computer generated copy lacking any sort of verification on 
behalf of the Petitioner’s employer. To prove said document  
Exh.D-3/1, the Petitioner could have easily adduced his bank 
statement of the salary account, got opened through Exh.D-3/2, 
transpiring exact deposits from his company on account of his salary 
as well as he could have produced his employer or any other 
authorized official of the company in support of sanctity, truthfulness 
and genuine status of Exh.P-3/1. The Petitioner’s employer or his 
authorized official, whilst appearing in witness box, could have 
brought on record bank and tax record to establish & prove 
remittances in the Petitioner’s salary account on head of his salary.   

W.P.Nos.370 of 2024 
 
       8 
 
17. 
However, the Petitioner did not come up with task and had 
been satisfied only to produce Exh.D-3/1 and Exh.D-3/2 for proving 
his salary, which his attempt falls short of ground on account of no 
evidentiary value sailing along both said documents. Though the 
Provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 are not stricto sensu 
applicable to Family matters, but Exh.D-3/1 is bereft of any strength 
and 
evidentiary 
value. 
If 
salary 
slip 
had 
been 
an 
official/attested/verified document, then situation would have been 
different, but genuine origination and sanctity of Exh.D-3/1 is far 
from required standards for being relied upon in light of 
aforementioned scenario.   
18. 
In light of above discussed failure of the Petitioner, the courts 
below had no option but to believe evidence produced by the 
Respondent No.1 regarding agitated immediate necessities of 
claimants of maintenance allowance and fixing up same keeping in 
light the Petitioner’s obligations as well. Moreover, each and every 
aspect of the issue relevant to claimed maintenance allowance has 
been discussed by both courts below in light of available evidence 
and the Petitioner is absolutely unable to indicate any misreading or 
non-reading of evidence by courts below whilst reaching up to the 
impugned findings of facts relevant thereto. It is held by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in “ARIF FAREED versus BIBI SARA and 
others” (2023 SCMR 413) that “The Family Courts Act, 1964 does 
not provide the right of second appeal to any party to the 
proceedings. The legislature intended to place a full stop on the 
family litigation after it was decided by the appellate court. 
However, we regretfully observe that the High Courts routinely 
exercise their extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as a substitute 
of appeal or revision and more often the purpose of the statute i.e., 
expeditious disposal of the cases is compromised and defied. No 
doubt, there may be certain cases where the intervention could be 
justified but a great number falls outside this exception.” In this 

W.P.Nos.370 of 2024 
 
       9 
 
case, in light of attending circumstances, no ground whatsoever is 
available compelling this Court to substitute the concurrent 
findings of courts below with their own, particularly in light of 
situation that the Petitioner makes way through on basis of short 
falls of no one, but of his own. 
19. 
For what has been discussed above, this writ petition has no 
merits which is hereby dismissed.
