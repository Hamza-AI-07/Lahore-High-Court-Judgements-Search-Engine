The purpose of placing this matter before us 
is to search out the point that whether instant 
petition is maintainable or the petitioner should have 
filed civil revision. To solve this proposition, we 
have summarized the controversy into a question, 
which is as under: 
Whether the judgment passed by the first 
appellate court deciding objections to the award 
under Section 30/33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 
would be challenged by an aggrieved person 
before this Court either through revision petition 
under Section 115 C.P.C or constitutional 
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973? 
 
The history resulting in formulation of the 
aforementioned question is that the titled writ 
petition came up for hearing before a learned Single 
Bench on 02.10.2019 who, being of the opinion that 
civil revision under Section 115 C.P.C. is 
maintainable in instant matter, questioned the 
learned counsel for the petitioners regarding 

 
W.P.No.57166/2019 
2
maintainability of the instant constitutional petition 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 against the judgment 
passed by the learned Additional District Judge 
while exercising appellate jurisdiction. The learned 
counsel answered that he initially filed civil revision 
against the impugned order but due to an objection 
raised by the office that civil revision was not 
maintainable, he amended his case and filed 
constitutional petition.  
2.  
After hearing the submission of the learned 
counsel, the learned Single Bench summoned the 
concerned official from office who stated that in the 
light of judgment rendered by a learned Singh 
Bench cited as Muhammad Nawaz vs. Mian Khan, 
etc. (PLJ 2019 Lahore 249) office is entertaining 
only constitutional petition in such like matters. 
3. 
Upon sprouting of the aforesaid fact, the 
learned Single Bench, dealing with the instant 
constitutional petition, observed that the view taken 
in Muhammad Nawaz’s case (supra) is contrary to 
the view taken in a case cited as Noor Alam through 
L.Rs. and another vs. Muhammad Bashir and 
another (2015 CLC 1675), thus, he referred the 
matter to the Hon’ble Chief Justice for placing the 
matter before a Division Bench so as to settle this 
issue conclusively. Accordingly, the case was 
proceeded and now the matter is before us to answer 
the afore-quoted question.   
4. 
Before 
answering 
the question, 
it 
is 
necessary to give precise facts of the case. The 

 
W.P.No.57166/2019 
3
respondents filed an application under Sections 30 
& 33 of The Arbitration Act, 1940 for cancellation 
of agreements for appointment of arbitrators & 
arbitration decisions which was accepted by learned 
Civil Judge, Bhalwal vide order dated 06.04.2018. 
Against the said decision, the petitioners filed an 
appeal under Section 39 of the Act ibid which was 
dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge, 
through judgment dated 19.08.2019. The petitioners 
have assailed the aforesaid orders through this writ 
petition. 
5. 
We have heard the arguments of learned 
counsels for the parties on the aforesaid question of 
law and have gone through the record with their 
able assistance. 
6. 
Under Section 39 of the Arbitration Act, 
1940 the remedy of appeal is provided against 
orders but no second appeal is provided. For 
reference, aforesaid Section is reproduced as under: 
“39. Appealable orders.__(1) An appeal shall lie from 
the following orders passed under this Act (and  from 
no  others)  to the Court authorized by law to hear 
appeals from original decrees of the Court passing 
the order:_  
   
An order__ 
(i) superseding an arbitration; 
(ii) on an award stated in the form of a special cases;  
(iii) modifying or correcting an award; 
(iv) filing or refusing to file an arbitration      
agreement; 
(v) staying or refusing to stay legal proceedings 
where there is an arbitration agreement; 
(vi) setting aside or refusing to set aside an    award:  
 
Provided that the provisions of this section shall not 
apply to any order passed by a Small Cause Court.  
(2) No second appeal shall lie  from an order passed  
in appeal under this section, but nothing in this 
Section shall affect or take away any right to appeal 
to the Supreme Court.”

As there is no direct provision available in the Act 
ibid regarding availability of remedy of revision 
petition under Section 115 C.P.C, as such we have 
to look up to the precedents of the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, which is the ultimate expositor of 
law. We are privileged to seek guidance from a 
Samiullah’s case1 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan has held that the revision petition 
is competent under Section 115 C.P.C. in arbitration 
proceedings. It would be of great help in the context 
of the matter to reproduce the relevant extract of the 
judgment (supra) as under: 
“Mr. N. A. Faruqui, the learned counsel for the 
petitioner, has urged two points in support of the 
petition. In the first place, the learned counsel has 
contended that the High Court has no jurisdiction 
under Section 115, C. P. C. to interfere with the order 
of the Additional District Judge on the ground that it 
was an erroneous one. Secondly, he contended that 
the Arbitrator has given an incomplete award and, 
therefore, the learned Additional District Judge was 
justified in setting aside the award. None of 
contentions raised by the leaned counsel has any 
force. It is quite clear from the facts of the present 
case that no relief was claimed by respondent No.1 
against respondent No.2. In view of this the 
Arbitrator was perfectly justified in dismissing the 
claim of respondent No.1 against respondent No.2. 
By doing so, he has not committed any illegality or 
been guilty of any mis-conduct. The learned 
Additional District, Judge, therefore, was not justified 
in setting aside the award on the ground that no relief 
was granted against respondent No.2. By doing so he 
has committed an illegality and, therefore, the High 
Court was quite competent to set aside the order of the 
Additional District Judge under section 115, C. P. C.”

The Hon’ble Apex Court of the country reiterated 
the aforesaid view in Rahim Jan’s case2 by holding 
as under: 
 “7… it is expedient to note that statutory right in 
terms of sections 17 and 39 of the Act, 1940 is 
available to an aggrieved person to institute appeal 
and if appeal is not competent then the parameters of 
section 115 would be applicable, which envisages 
that revision would be competent if no appeal lies. It 
is pertinent to mention here that section 115 does not 
say that if appeal is not competent under the Code, 
only then revision would be competent, as such 
conclusion would be that if the Code of Civil 
Procedure is applicable or has been made applicable 
on the proceedings then the order passed by any 
Court, subordinate to the High Court can be 
challenged in the revision.” 
   
The August Supreme Court of Pakistan in Messrs 
Tribal Friends Co.’s case3 has also held that where 
no remedy of appeal is provided in the Arbitration 
Law and the court has exceeded jurisdiction or acted 
without jurisdiction or committed irregularity in 
conduct of proceedings or passed an order in 
violation of natural justice which cannot be assailed 
under Act ibid, then High Court may exercise its 
jurisdiction under Section 115 C.P.C on an 
application of the party or suo motu. For ready 
reference, the relevant portion of the judgment 
(supra) is reproduced as under: 
“8….The applicability of section 115 of C.P.C. 
has not been completely excluded. In cases where 
remedy has been provided by appeal within the 
framework of the Arbitration Act revision 
application will not lie but in cases where these 
provisions do not apply the revisional jurisdiction 
of the High Court under section 115, C.P.C. can 
be invoked. Where in cases no appeal is provided 
and the Court has exceeded jurisdiction, acted 
                                          
2 Rahim Jan Vs. Mrs. Z. Ikram Gardezi and others (PLD 2004 SC 752) 
3 Messrs Tribal Friends Co. Vs. Province of Balochistan (2002 SCMR 1903) 

 
W.P.No.57166/2019

without 
jurisdiction, 
committed 
material 
irregularity in the conduct of proceedings, passed 
order in violation of principles of natural justice 
and the same cannot be assailed under the 
provisions of the Arbitration Act and the High 
Court may exercise its supervisory jurisdiction 
under Section 115, C.P.C. on an application 
made by any party or suo motu.” 
   
The aforementioned case law was followed by the 
learned Single Bench while authoring Noor Alam’s 
case. 
5.  
On the other hand, perusal of Muhammad 
Nawaz’s case shows that the learned Single Bench 
has held therein that after exhausting the remedy 
under Section 39 of the Act ibid, remedy of second 
appeal is prohibited and thus, on the same analogy 
the remedy of civil revision under Section 115 
C.P.C. is also not available. The operative part of 
the judgment (supra) is as under:- 
4. ….I am further of the view that even a revision 
petition against the judgment passed by the 
learned 
Additional 
District 
Judge 
is 
not 
competent is provided under the statute. If no 
power of revision is provided under the statute 
i.e. Arbitration Act, 1940, same forum is not 
available against the appellate judgment rendered 
in accordance with Section 39 of the Arbitration 
Act, 1940. In this eventuality, at the most the 
orders impugned through this second appeal 
could 
have 
been 
challenged 
through 
a 
constitution petition if the same are without 
jurisdiction….” 
 
6.  
The Arbitration Act, 1940 is a special statute 
having limited application relating to matters 
governed by the said Act. The revisional jurisdiction 
of the High Court under the C.P.C or under any 
other statute therefore shall not stand superseded 
under the Act ibid and if the Act does not contain 

 
W.P.No.57166/2019 
7
any express bar against exercise of revisional power 
by the high Court provided exercise of such 
revisional power does not militate against giving 
effect to the provision of the Act ibid. There is no 
express provision in the Arbitration Act putting an 
embargo against filing a revisional application 
against appellate order under Section 39 of the Act. 
The Arbitration Act has put an embargo on filing 
any second appeal from appellate order under 
Section 39 of the Act. It may be stated that even if a 
special statute expressly attaches finality to an 
appellate order passed under that statute, such 
provision of finality will not take away revisional 
powers of the High Court under Section 115 of 
C.P.C. There is also no such express provision in 
the Arbitration Act attaching finality to the appellate 
order under Section 39 of the said Act. As already 
indicated, only bar under sub-section (2) of Section 
39 is of a second appeal from an appellate order 
under Section 39 of the Act ibid.     
7. 
In the light of the aforesaid discussion, we 
are of the considered view that the judgment passed 
by the learned appellate Court deciding objections 
to the Award under Section 30 & 33 of the Act ibid 
can be challenged through a revision petition under 
Section 115 C.P.C.  
8.  
The legal question has since been answered, 
therefore, this constitutional petition is converted 
into civil revision, which will now come up for 
hearing before a Single Bench for its decision on 

 
W.P.No.57166/2019

merits. Office is directed to fix the case before a 
Single Bench on 23.02.2022 after fulfilling the 
codal formalities.
