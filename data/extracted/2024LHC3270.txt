Date of hearing:

This and connected appeals, bearing R.F.A No. 
1584/2015 and RFA No.1443/2015 [latter preferred by respondent No.1 for 
seeking modification of the judgment and decree under reference], are directed 
against consolidated judgment and decree dated 28.07.2015, in terms whereof 
Banking Court decreed the recovery suit, instituted by respondent No.1 
[hereinafter referred as the „financial institution‟], for Rs.7,268,401 with costs 
[against claimed amount of Rs.10,306,894/-]. And action for claiming damages 
of Rs.32,817,314/-, sought by the appellants, was dismissed. 
2. 
Brief facts, relevant for the adjudication of subject matter appeals, are 
that on the request of the appellants, the financial institution extended finance 
by way of allowing opening of letter of credit [at sight] bearing L/C 
No.800371/0813 dated 13.09.1997. Letter of Credit (hereinafter referred to as 
„Credit‟) was subjected to the terms of Uniform Practice for Documentary 

R.F.A No. 1583/2015.

Credits (1993 Revision), International Chamber of Commerce, Publication 
No.500 [UCP 500]. Financial institution brought action on 19.09.1999 under 
jurisdiction conferred by the Banking Companies (Recovery of Loans, 
Advances, Credits and Finances) Act, 1997, latter repealed through the 
Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance 2001.  
  
It is the case of the financial institution that the documents, inclusive of 
proforma invoice, bill of lading and letter of credit, were duly presented and 
accordingly honored by the financial institution by making payment to the 
confirming / negotiating Bank of the beneficiary, after failure of the appellants 
to make payments in terms of their obligations, despite persistent demands. 
Financial institution claimed that forced Payment against Documents (PAD), 
after lapse of stipulated time, stood converted into Finance against Imported 
Merchandize [FIM]. On the converse, appellants brought action for claiming 
financial damages on the premise that payment made by the financial 
institution was contrary to the terms of Credit, which prohibited option of 
transshipment. Appellants alleged that despite knowledge and intimation that 
carrier birthed at the port of Singapore, where goods were de-stuffed and 
shifted to another container and then transported to port of destination through 
another carrier financial institution acted contrary to the obligations. Both suits 
were consolidated, and evidence was recorded. Upon conclusion of the trial the 
suit for recovery was decreed and suit for damages dismissed.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellants pleaded that payments made by 
financial institution were contrary to the terms of Credit, hence no enforceable 
obligation could be placed on the appellants to repay the wrongly disbursed 

R.F.A No. 1583/2015.

amounts. Adds that transshipment was specifically prohibited, whereby goods 
in question were required to be shipped directly from the port of shipment to 
the port of discharge. And such material condition was conspicuously breached. 
Further submits that factum of violation of condition of Credit was discussed 
with the officials of the Bank, which despite awareness proceeded to make 
payment. Submits that interception with the goods during transshipment and 
change of carrier caused damage to the goods, which resulted in appellants‟ 
failure to honour third party commitments and damages ensued. Submits that 
documentary evidence produced proved factum of breach of terms of the 
Credit. Learned counsel cited following decisions “Master Muhammad Bashir Vs. 
Moinuddin” (1990 CLC 703), “Muhammad Arshad Khan Vs. Chairman, M.D.A and 6 
others” (1997 MLD 3066), “Bashir Ahmad Vs. Abdul Wahid” (PLD 1995 Lahore 98), 
“Habib Bank Limited Vs. Judge Banking Court and others” (2015 CLD 1875), 
“Crescent Leasing Corporation Limited through Constituted Attorney Vs. Messrs 
Sarhad Goods Transport Company and 3 others” (2013 CLD 854), “Rehmatullah 
Khan and another Vs. Ghulam Farid and others” (2009 SCMR 371), “Administration 
Municipal Corporation, Multan through T.M.O and 2 others Vs. Haider Zaman 
Qureshi” (2012 MLD 948), “Shah Nawaz and another Vs. Nawab Khan” (PLD 1976 
S.C 767), “MCB Bank Limited Vs. Sunshine Cloth Limited” (C.O.S No. 152/2010), 
“United Bank Limited Vs. Messrs Ilyas Enterprises through Proprietor Mr. Ilyas Malik 
and 2 others” (2004 CLD 1338).  
4. 
Learned counsel for the financial institution submits that jurisprudence 
regarding the scope and extent of liability under the Credit facility is well 
settled, evolving the principle that “bank(s) deal in the documents and not 
concerned with the goods underlying Credit”. And albeit any damage caused, 
if any actually occasioned as alleged, would neither discharge the bank from 

R.F.A No. 1583/2015.

fulfilling its contractual obligations under the Credit and nor shall it absolve 
appellants from fulfilling their obligation to repay the amounts paid to the 
beneficiary of the Credit. Adds that documents, including bill of lading and 
letter of credit, were accepted by the appellants and no discrepancy was 
pointed or raised before the liability to pay triggered. Submits that sufficient 
evidence was led to prove default of obligation under the terms of irrevocable 
letter of credit. Financial institution seeks modification of the amount subject 
of decree. Following decisions are cited to support contentions, reported as 
“Messrs Sazco (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Askari Commercial Bank Limited” (2021 SCMR 558), 
“S.A. Hameed and others Vs. Allied Bank of Pakistan Limited and others” (2004 CLD 
1620) and “Habib Bank Limited Vs. Tauqeer Ahmed Siddiqui and another” (2009 CLD 
312). 
5.  
Heard. Record perused.  
6. 
During course of hearing, we asked learned counsel for financial 
institution to inform about the date when payment was made to the beneficiary 
under the terms of letter of Credit, and date, when allegedly facility of PAD 
[payment against documents], was created. Learned counsel could not provide 
specific dates for the payment and creation of PAD, who elaborated that PAD 
facility was converted in FIM facility, factum whereof was recorded on 
16.02.1998 in the Statement of Account [Exh.P-13] and overdue amount of Rs. 
8,594,691/- was debited for adjustment of PAD. 
7. 
Notwithstanding, non-availability of critical dates and requisite details, 
we proceed to deal with the elephant in the room; that whether the financial 
institution was under any legal obligation to make payment to the beneficiary 
under the Credit arrangement, when one of the core conditions therein was 

R.F.A No. 1583/2015. 
 
 
5
allegedly violated during the course of shipment – violation being clause 
prohibiting transshipment. There is no cavil that Banks may decline request for 
payment to the beneficiary under the Credit, upon receiving the documents, on 
the premise that terms of Credit, regarding the prohibition qua transshipment, 
were violated provided such recusal is legally and contractually justified, 
drawing support from the conditions encapsulated in the bill of lading. On the 
contrary, Banks cannot justify denial of payment obligation, simplicitor on the 
ground of alleged violation of provision of transshipment in Credit, provided 
incidence of violation comes within one of the exceptions provided under 
Article 23 of UCP 500 – relevant and applicable to the Credit under reference. 
Whether the terms of bill of lading were examined and considered by the 
Banking Court for the purposes of deciding the option with the financial 
institution, either to make payment or opt recusal, as the case may be in terms 
of the conditions in bill of lading. Both learned counsel extensively argued 
regarding the scope and effect of condition of prohibition of transshipment in 
the Credit, but none had either referred to any specific corroborating clause in 
the bill of lading nor highlighted the exclusion or inapplicability of the 
exceptions provided under Article 23, ibid. – that obligates the Bank to make 
payment under Credit despite prohibition qua transshipment. Notably, no such 
condition is found appearing at the front page of bill of lading, sued and relied 
upon, or on the reverse page of bill of lading [incidentally terms of the bill of 
lading on the reverse page were not provided with the record and we strongly 
believe that said terms were not discussed before the Banking Court, since 
evidently, Banking Court had not recorded any finding with reference to any 

R.F.A No. 1583/2015.

such condition, reiterating prohibition qua transshipment in the bill of lading 
vis-à-vis corresponding condition of the Credit].  
  
Needless to mention that for the purposes of determining the 
enforceability of obligation of the financial institution, notwithstanding 
induction of condition of prohibition of transshipment in the Credit, analysis of 
the terms of bill of lading and evaluation of exceptions in Article 23 of the 
UCP 500, [inter alia the conditions discussed in clause (d) thereof], must be 
undertaken and necessarily be adjudicated upon, without which determination 
neither the conclusiveness of the obligation of the financial institution would 
be ascertained nor corresponding obligation of the applicant of the Credit is 
determinable.  
 
Article 23 of UCP 500 is reproduced for ease of reference, 
 
 
“Article 23. Marine/Ocean Bill of Lading 
a. If a Credit calls for a bill of lading covering a port-to-port 
shipment, banks will, unless otherwise stipulated in the 
Credit, accept a document, however named, which: 
i) appears on its face to indicate the name of the carrier and 
to have been signed or otherwise authenticated by: 
- the carrier or a named agent for or on behalf of the carrier, 
or 
- the master or a named agent for or on behalf of the master. 
Any signature or authentication of the carrier or master 
must be identified as carrier or master, as the case may be. 
An agent signing or authenticating for the carrier or master 
must also indicate the name and the capacity of the party, 
i.e. carrier or master, on whose behalf that agent is acting, 
and 
ii) indicates that the goods have been loaded on board, or 
shipped on a named vessel. Loading on board or shipment 
on a named vessel may be indicated by pre-printed wording 
on the bill of lading that the goods have been loaded on 
board a named vessel or shipped on a named vessel, in 
which case the date of issuance of the bill of lading will be 
deemed to be the date of loading on board and the date of 
shipment. In all other cases loading on board a named 
vessel must be evidenced by a notation on the bill of lading 

R.F.A No. 1583/2015. 
 
 
7
which gives the date on which the goods have been loaded 
on board, in which case the date of the on board notation 
will be deemed to be the date of shipment. If the bill of 
lading contains the indication "intended vessel," or similar 
qualification in relation to the vessel, loading on board a 
named vessel must be evidenced by an on board notation on 
the bill of lading which, in addition to the date on which the 
goods have been loaded on board, also includes the name of 
the vessel on which the goods have been loaded, even if they 
have been loaded on the vessel named as the "intended 
vessel". If the bill of lading indicates a place of receipt or 
taking in charge different from the port of loading, the on 
board notation must also include the port of loading 
stipulated in the Credit and the name of the vessel on which 
the goods have been loaded, even if they have been loaded 
on the vessel named in the bill of lading. This provision also 
applies whenever loading on board the vessel is indicated 
by pre-printed wording on the bill of lading, and 
iii) indicates the port of loading and the port of discharge 
stipulated in the credit, notwithstanding that it: 
(a) indicates a place of taking in charge different from the port 
of loading, and/or a place of final destination different from 
the port of discharge, and/or 
(b) contains the indication "intended" or similar qualification 
in relation to the port of loading and/or port of discharge, 
as long as the document also states the ports of loading 
and/or discharge stipulated in the Credit, and 
iv) consists of a sole original bill of lading, or if issued in 
more than one original, the full set as so issued, and 
v) appears to contain all of the terms and conditions of 
carriage, or some of such terms and conditions by reference 
to a source or document other than the bill of lading(short 
form/blank back bill of lading), banks will not examine the 
contents of such terms and conditions, and 
vi) contains no indication that it is subject to a charter party 
and/or no indication that the carrying vessel is propelled by 
sail only, and 
vii) in all other respects meets the stipulations of the Credit. 
b. For the purpose of this Article, transhipment means 
unloading and reloading from one vessel to another vessel 
during the course of ocean carriage from the port of 
loading to the port of discharge stipulated in the Credit. 
c. Unless transhipment is prohibited by the terms of the Credit, 
banks will accept a bill of lading which indicates that the 
goods will be transhipped, provided that the entire ocean 
carriage is covered by one and the same bill of lading. 
d. Even if the Credit prohibits transhipment, banks will accept 
a bill of lading which: 

R.F.A No. 1583/2015.

i) indicates that transhipment will take place as long as the 
relevant cargo is shipped in Container (s) , Trailer(s) 
and/or "LASH" barge (s) as evidenced by the bill of lading, 
provided that the entire ocean carriage is covered by one 
and the same bill of lading, and/or 
ii) incorporates clauses stating that the carrier reserves the 
right to tranship.” 
 
[Emphasis supplied] 
 
We observed that Banking Court failed to undertake such crucial inquiry into 
material facts and conspicuously ignored determination of critical questions, 
touching the exceptions appearing in Article 23 of UCP 500, for instance, 
firstly, whether bill of lading had provided „continuous cover to the goods – 
[covering voyage from Sydney Australia to Karachi, Pakistan] from the port of 
shipment to port of discharge – and secondly whether bill of lading contained 
any condition regarding specific disclaimer of liability on the part of the ship 
owner carrier in event of transshipment – both questions had material affect 
qua the obligations of the parties, the appellants and financial institution, and 
assist in determining the context of prohibition of transshipment in the Credit. 
8. 
We examined various clauses of APPLICATION AND AGREEMENT 
FOR IRREVOCABLE DOCUMENTARY CREDIT FREELY NEGOTIABLE 
IN BENEFICIARY‟S COUNTRY, which are found relevant for the purposes 
of determining the controversy under reference – in particular clause 17 
thereof – “Irrespective of the port to which shipment are affected we shall 
purchase the documents o lodgment under clause 1 above” - but evidently not 
considered and appreciated by the Banking Court. It is evident that Banking 
Court adjudged claims erroneously without indicating or considering the terms 
and conditions of bill of lading in the context of the scope and effect of Article 

R.F.A No. 1583/2015.

23 of UCP 500. In wake of these lapses judgment under reference is found not 
sustainable in law. 
9. 
During hearing of the appeals, we inquired from learned counsel for the 
financial institution that whether bill of exchange – referred in the evidence in 
chief of PW-1 – is produced and available on record, who stated that no such 
bill of exchange is available. Non-availability of bill of exchange or failure to 
produce have had its own consequences qua the claims. We observed that one 
of the conditions of letter of credit reads as,  
“Your manually signed drafts in duplicate drawn on the 
importers at sight for full invoice value of shipment(s) and 
marked “Drawn under the Habib Bank Limited Credit 
No.800371/0813 must accompany the documents” 
       
10. 
Likewise, the recitals of APPLICATION AND AGREEMENT FOR 
IRREVOCABLE DOCUMENTARY CREDIT FREELY NEGOTIABLE IN 
BENEFICIARY‟S COUNTRY referred to negotiation of manually signed 
drafts drawn on the applicant of the Credit. Notably bill of exchange was 
referred in the affidavit in evidence but not produced on record. What would 
be the effect of non-presentation of the drafts with the documents? Does it 
indicate compliance or otherwise? Banking Court was required to examine and 
decide regarding the effect of non-production or non-availability of the drafts, 
whatever may be the case. This another lapse on the part of the Banking Court 
further weakens the judgment under challenge. 
11. 
Additionally, there are few other aspects / issues, which were not 
considered by the Banking Court, for instance what was the fate of the goods 
in question – since the title of the goods, constructive or otherwise, vests in the 
holder of bill of lading. As per terms of bill of lading, freight was prepaid and 

R.F.A No. 1583/2015. 
 
 
10
effect thereof needs to be considered while determining factum of obligations 
of the parties. Appellants claimed that goods were damaged as a consequence 
of alleged transshipment. It appears that goods in question were insured. What 
was the role and responsibility of the Insurance company, in the facts and 
circumstances encountered. This aspect was not considered by the Banking 
Court. Furthermore, financial institution alleged that Credit facility, upon 
payment being transformed into PAD facility, and eventually converted into 
FIM facility. Whether cause of action was rested on the Credit arrangement or 
FIM facility, which triggers another moot question that whether doctrine of 
novation is attracted and what was the cause and effect of novation, if it 
actually happened. In the context of an incomplete, bald and inconclusive 
adjudication the judgment impugned need not to be examined in the context of 
ratio settled in the case-law cited. 
12. 
In view of the aforesaid we arrived at a conclusion that judgment and 
decree assailed does not constitute a valid, fair and proper adjudication of all-
inclusive issues / questions, which judgment even dealt with the partial issues 
superficially. Questions raised and left unattended had jettisoned the lawful 
existence of the judgment, which needs to be declared ineffective and illegal. 
13. 
We, hereby, set-aside the impugned judgment and decree dated 
28.07.2015 and allow instant and connected appeal bearing R.F.A 
No.1584/2015 and decide to remand the matter, in terms of the directions infra, 
to the Banking Court in wake of numerous unattended issues / questions. We 
direct / observe that the suits, preferred by the appellants and respondent No.1, 
shall be deemed pending and the Banking Court will proceed to frame 

R.F.A No. 1583/2015. 
 
 
11
additional issues, in the context of the observations recorded regarding 
unattended issues / questions, and call upon the parties to lead evidence on 
additional issues and thereafter decide the suits afresh on merits without being 
influenced by any observation recorded supra, since aforesaid observations are 
solely for the purpose of deciding appeals and not intended to prejudice any of 
the parties or influence determination of the lis on merits.  
14. 
Once judgment in question is set-aside appeal of the financial institution, 
RFA No.1443/2015 becomes infructuous. No order as to the costs.
