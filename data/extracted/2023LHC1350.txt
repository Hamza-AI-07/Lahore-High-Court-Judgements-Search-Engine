Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:-  Brief facts of the case, as 
mentioned in this constitutional petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 are that 
the petitioners are owners of land measuring 75 Kanal 14 Marla 
bearing Khewat No.379 Khatoni No.3553 and 353/407, Khasra 
Nos.5244 and 5245 situated in revenue estate Chunian Otar, 
District Kasur. The respondents No.2 to 4/Military Lands & 
Cantonments authorities took possession of the land including the 
land owned by the petitioners for establishing Chunian 
Cantonment and constructed a boundary-wall around it. 
Thereafter, the respondents dispossessed the petitioners from 
their aforesaid owned land. The petitioners alleged that the 
possession of land was taken without adopting the legal process 
i.e. purchasing the land through private treaty or acquisitioning

the land under Land Acquisition Act, 1894 or executing any lease 
agreement etc. The petitioners filed numerous applications for 
redressal of their grievance but in vain. On 06.10.2012, the 
petitioners moved an application before the respondent 
No.1/Secretary Defence, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad. In 
reply to the above application, the respondents No.2 to 4 admitted 
that the land owned by the petitioners is in possession of the 
respondents and that the acquisition process is underway and that 
due to financial constraints, the said process could not be got 
finalized as yet. 
 
 The petitioners filed another application to respondent 
No.5/Assistant 
Commissioner/Land 
Acquisition 
Collector, 
Chunian for return of the possession of the land in question or in 
alternate prayed for grant of the compensation of the land. The 
report was sought from the revenue officer who reported that the 
land owned by the petitioners fall within the boundary area of 
cantonment which has been leased out by the Defence 
Department. The respondent No.5 urged the respondent 
No.4/Military Estate Officer, Lahore Circle to resolve the dispute 
in question but no positive response was received from the said 
Quarters. The petitioners made request for the acquisition of the 
land of the petitioners but no substantive steps have been taken 
by the respondents. The petitioners have now prayed through the 
writ petition as under:  
“In view of the above submissions it is humbly prayed that the titled 
petition may very kindly be accepted by directing the respondents to 
expeditiously complete the process of acquisition of their lands as 
per provisions of the Punjab Land Acquisition Act 1894 within a 
period of one month or the respondents may very kindly be directed 
to restore the petitioners’ possession in the light of Article 23 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.” 
 
2.  
The respondents in their report and parawise comments 
have admitted that the land in question is owned by the 
petitioners and further stated that the acquisition process is 

 
W.P.No.251251/2018 
 
3
underway which will be completed at the earliest. During 
proceedings of this case, Irfan Ahmad, Military Estate Officer 
Lahore Circle appeared in person before this Court on 06.12.2022 
and has stated that the issue of acquisition of the land in question 
would be finalized within one month as to whether the land is 
required for public purpose or the same is returnable to the 
petitioners. On 02.02.2023, said officer again appeared and 
wanted to record statement but due to non-availability of learned 
counsel for the petitioner, his statement could not be recorded and 
the case was adjourned to 02.03.2023. On 02.03.2023, a letter 
dated 17.01.2023 was produced by the respondents where an 
inability has been shown that due to financial constraints, the 
acquisition process is not possible for the time being; at this 
juncture, the learned counsel for the petitioners requested this 
Court to decide the case on merits.  
3. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsels for the 
parties and have gone through the record with their able 
assistance. 
4. 
Indeed, Islam is complete code which furnishes an 
elaborate and comprehensive guideline having universal 
approach regarding each and every aspect of the human life and 
inter alia protects / guarantees the rights of the life and property 
of every individual. The Islamic principles prohibit forcible 
taking of the property of people unless a fair compatible 
compensation is paid to the owners. For reference, the translation 
of relevant part of Ayat No.188 of Surah Al-Baqarah, is 
mentioned as under:  
"اور مت اےنپ امل آسپ ںیم ابلط رطوقیں ےس ڑہپ ہن رکو"۔ 
The Last Holy Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) in his sermon/address 
delivered on the occasion of the farewell Hajj has bestowed the 

 
W.P.No.251251/2018 
 
4
people an absolute charter of human rights, while reiterating the 
importance of non-interfering into the properties of other Muslim 
which is quoted as under:  
“Your blood, your properties, and your honour are sacred to one 
another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this (sacred) town 
(Mecca) of yours, in this month of yours.” 
 
[Sahih Al-Bukhari : Vol. II Chapter  No.132, Hadith No.795  
Translation by Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan] 
  
Further, in the initial era of Islam first acquisition of land was 
made for the construction of Al-Masjid-an-Nabawi. The said land 
was owned by two orphan children (Sohul & Sohail) who offered 
the said land as a gift which was refused by the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad (ﷺ) and after payment of full price of the land, 
construction of the Mosque was started. This elevated event has 
been reported in Sahi Bukhari which prescribed as under:  
"

…… 
 
260. Definitions.… 
“Property” includes any right, title or interest in property, movable 
or immovable, and any means and instruments of production;” 
 
The sole grievance of the petitioners is that their land has been 
taken over by the respondent for establishment of Cantonment 
Area and no compensation has been paid to them even after 
passing of a considerable period. For this willful inaction of the 
respondents, the petitioners are suffering from mental agony and 
also facing the financial losses. In this regard, the petitioners 
moved an application to the Ministry of Defence who in respect 
to the above application vide letter dated 10.01.2013 admitted the 
ownership of the petitioners and observed that respondents are in 
possession of the said land. It was further intimated that the case 
of acquisition of land measuring 1434 Kanal, including the land 

 
W.P.No.251251/2018 
 
7
of the petitioners, is in process and due to some financial 
constraints the acquisition process could not be finalized.  
  
It is a settled law that if the land owned by the petitioners 
was required to the respondent-authorities, then it was their 
bounded duty to assess its price, pay the compensation to the 
petitioners and then use the land for the required purpose but 
unfortunately the settled legal process has not been adopted rather 
in contravention of law, the possession of the subject land was 
straightaway taken over by the respondent without payment of 
even a single penny. Since then unfortunately, petitioners are 
running from pillar to post with their request to either grant 
compensation or return the possession of the land, if not required 
any further by the respondent-authorities. 
5. 
As after lapse of considerable period, the grievance of the 
petitioners was not redressed by the respondent-authorities. The 
petitioners have also filed numerous applications for redressal of 
their grievance to the Assistant Commissioner/Land Acquisition 
Collector, Chunian, who through letter dated 12.04.2014 obtained 
report from the concerned revenue officer. As per report of the 
Revenue Officer, the land of the petitioners has fallen within the 
boundary wall of the cantonment area and possession whereof is 
with the defence department who has leased it to some other 
persons. For ready reference, the aforesaid report is reproduced as 
under:

After receiving the aforementioned report, the Assistant 
Commissioner, Chunian wrote a letter to the respondent 
No.4/Military Estate Officer, Lahore Region on 19.05.2014 for 
redressal of the grievance of the petitioners whose land is in 
possession of the respondents and is also being cultivated by the 
lessee of the respondents. For reference, aforesaid letter is 
reproduced as under: 
“To 
 
 
 
The Military Estates Officer, 
 
 
Lahore Circle, Lahore Cantt. 
 
Subject:- 
APPLICATION OF MUHAMMAD YOUNIS S/O  
 
 
JALAL-UD-DIN ETC R/O CHUNIAN. 
 
 
 
Muhammad Younis S/O Jalal-ud-Din etc R/O Chunian 
filed application before the undersigned with the contention that 
they are owner of the land measuring 76K-14M in village Chunian 
Ottar. For the last about 25 years the Pakistan Army of Chunian 
Cantt has occupied the said land and is leasing out to other persons 
without any permission. It has also been contended in the 
application that the land in question has also been rented out to the 
Bricks Killen owners for lifting of earth for bricks. The applicants 
stated that the lease money may be given to them and their 
possession be restored. 
 
 
The matter was referred to the Consolidation Officer, 
Chunian for report. It has been reported by the field staff that 
according to record, the applicants are owners of land measuring 

 
W.P.No.251251/2018 
 
9
75K-14M  bearing Khasra No.5244 and 5245 of village Chunian 
Ottar which is situated within the boundary wall of Cantt area. The 
land is under the possession of Pakistan Army and is cultivated at 
site. It has clearly been stated that the Defence Department has 
leased out the land. It has been recommended  by the Tehsildar, 
Chunian that the lease money be made to the applicants. 
 
 
In view of the above, you are requested to redress the 
grievance of the applicants under intimation to this office.  
 
Assistant Commissioner 
Chunian” 
 
 
(emphasis supplied)  
Subsequently, the Assistant Commissioner, Chunian sent as many 
as four reminders on 25.02.2015, 09.05.2016, 08.08.2016 & 
22.08.2016 to the respondent-authorities with the request to 
initiate a legal process under Land Acquisition Act, 1894 
regarding the land in question but no bonafide endeavour is 
exhibited by the respondent.  
  
As a moral, religious, constitutional and legal sanctity is 
attached to the fundamental rights of the citizen under Articles 
23, 24 & 38 of the Constitution, whereby every citizen has the 
right to hold and use his property for his fiscal and social 
wellbeing and Article 3 of the Constitution placed the state under 
obligation to eliminate all forms of exploitation of citizens. Thus, 
it is not behove of a State or its Department to take away property 
of the individual without adhering to the principle of law. There 
is no cavil and cudgel that fortunately we have a written 
Constitution and written law with regard to every field of life and 
State institution/government functionary are placed under 
mandatory obligation to act in accordance with law, thus any 
willful non-compliance of the principles of law will be a 
dangerous menace which would lower the dignity of the country 
in the Comity of the Nations. Thus, the right to hold and use of 
the land by the owner of the said land cannot be taken away 
forcibly at the whims & caprice of State functionaries except as 
provided under the law and after payment of fair compatible 
compensation. In an identical matter, the government did not give 

 
W.P.No.251251/2018 
 
10
compensation to the land owners who knocked the door of this 
Court and this Court passed direction to the government-
functionaries to pay the compensation to the said aggrieved 
person. The decision was assailed before the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan who upheld the order of this Court in a case 
cited as Province of Punjab through Secretary Irrigation, 
Government of the Punjab, Lahore and 2 others Vs. Abdur 
Rehman Shaukat (1999 SCMR 2610) wherein it is held that the 
land acquired without giving compensation violates the Articles 
23 & 24 of the Constitution and also observed as under: 
“3. We do not find any substance in the argument inasmuch as it is 
admitted that the land of the respondent has been acquired and no 
compensation has been given to him in lieu of the said land. The 
aforesaid order of the High Court is just, fair and proper. We agree 
with the view taken by the High Court that the act of the petitioner 
in acquiring the land of the respondent without giving him the 
compensation is in violation of Articles 23 and 24 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.” 
 
In another case, land measuring 38 Kanal of a citizen was utilized 
by the Irrigation Department, without acquisition or his consent, 
to construct a bund to protect the lands owned by the then Chief 
Minster. The said matter went up to the Hon'ble Supreme Court 
of Pakistan wherein vide judgment cited as District Officer 
Revenue, Kasur Vs. Abdul Rehmat Shaukat (2006 SCMR 188) 
the Hon’ble Apex Court held as under:   
“5. Admittedly, the land of the respondent was utilized without 
recourse to lawful procedure. This act was not only illegal but 
highly immoral and reprehensible since the Province/State and its 
functionaries are supposed to protect the life, liberty and the 
property of citizen rather than forcibly using it for the benefit of the 
man in power. The petition filed by the petitioner to question the 
legality of takeover was allowed by the Lahore High Court on 
8.5.1997 on the statement of the then Advocate-General, with 
direction to the Punjab Government to allot 25 acres of agricultural 
land to the respondent. The judgment dated 8.5.1997 of the Lahore 
High Court was upheld by this Court when C.P. No.854/L of 1997 
filed by the Punjab Government was dismissed. For almost five 
years the petitioner and other functionaries of the Province dragged 
their feet and did not implement the direction of the Court. 
Respondent was compelled to file contempt application in the 
Lahore High Court on 9.6.2004. Instead of punishing the delinquent 
officials the High Court considered it expedient to once again direct 

 
W.P.No.251251/2018 
 
11
such officials to implement the direction within one month of 
receipt of judgment. It is regrettable that once again they did not 
comply with the directions and instead filed the present petition for 
leave to appeal. This Court took notice of non-compliance on 
10.8.2005 and it was on 15.8.2005 that (sensing the mood of the 
Court?) the Chief Secretary of the Province appeared and stated that 
“the compact piece of 25 acres agricultural land is being mutated 
and handed over to respondent today”. The matter was adjourned to 
19.8.2005. We are informed that consequent to the undertaking of 
the Chief Secretary the land measuring 200 Kanals has been 
mutated in favour of respondent in village Rakh Bhoniki Ottar 
Tehsil Pattoki, District Kasur and its possession delivered. 
6. 
It is clear that not only the petitioner but all the concerned 
officials of the Punjab Government have been guilty of the non-
compliance of not only the judgment and direction of the High 
Court dated 8.5.1997 but even of this Court since the said order of 
the High Court has been upheld by this Court. Even the initiation of 
contempt proceedings did not spur the officials to do that which 
they were legally bound to do. In its wisdom the High Court did not 
take the penal action and instead gave these officials another 
opportunity to comply with the direction. The officials were still not 
moved and they chose to challenge the direction of the High Court 
by filing the present petition for leave to appeal. It is crystal clear 
that had this Court not shown its displeasure, the petitioner and 
other officials had no intention to implement the direction of the 
High Court. It only reflects an extremely unsatisfactory state of 
affairs.” 
Another reliance is placed on a case cited as Nasirabad 
Properties Ltd. Vs. Chittagong Development Authority and other 
(PLD 1966 Dhaka 472) wherein it has been held that to use and 
hold possession of an owned property is fundamental right of an 
owner and imposing any restriction thereupon is illegal. Further 
reliance is placed on a case cited as Mst. Mukhtiar Fatima Vs. 
Deputy Commissioner, Multan and 2 others (1997 MLD 1792) 
wherein this Court has held that non-payment of compensation to 
a person whose land has been acquired would amount to violation 
of fundamental right guaranteed under Article 24 of the 
Constitution. Relevant portion of the judgment (supra) is 
reproduced as under: 
“3…..It is thus clear that the State cannot deprive a person of his 
property without paying compensation, therefore, in accordance 
with law. The relevant law under which the petitioner has been 
deprived of her land is the Land Acquisition Act. The compensation 
in terms of this Act has to be made to the owners of the property. If 

 
W.P.No.251251/2018 
 
12
an owner is not paid the price/compensation of the property 
acquired within the reasonable time, then it may amount to 
depriving the person of his property without compensation, in 
contravention of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 24 
(supra). Violation of a fundamental right guaranteed by the 
Constitution cannot be countenanced by Courts of law, particularly 
the High Court on which powers have been conferred as per clause 
(c) of Article 199(1) of the Constitution for issuing direction any 
person including any Government for enforcement of any one of the 
fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution. This clause reads 
as under:----- 
“(c)   On the application of any aggrieved person, make an 
order giving such directions to any person or authority, 
including any Government exercising any power of 
performing any function in, or in relation to, any territory 
within the jurisdiction of that Court as may be appropriate for 
the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred 
by Chap. 1 of Part II. ”  
  
 
This Court in a case cited as Ch. Muhammad Ishaq, Advocate Vs. 
Cantonment Executive Officer, Chunian, District Kasur and 
another (PLD 2009 Lahore 240) has already held that to impose 
a restriction upon an owner qua the free use of his property, it is 
the breach of the fundamental rights and it was held that the 
possession in such like cases is without lawful authority. For 
reference, relevant portion of the judgment (supra) is reproduced 
as under: 
“9. While construing and enforcing such rights, generous and 
purposive interpretation should be made and fullest possible 
meaning and amplitude must be given conforming to the real spirit 
of these rights,  thus keeping the above principles in view, the 
expression/word “HOLD” appearing in Article 23 does not simply 
mean to “keep”, “retain” or “occupy” the property rather in its true 
sense, it entails its use by an owner in the manner, he chooses to, 
with all the rights to enjoy the benefits of the property which 
necessarily flows and are pertinent and appurtenant to his 
ownership. Thus, when a restriction, which is not otherwise 
imposed by the law, is thrusted upon the owner qua the free user of 
his property, it is a clear case of the breach of his fundamental 
rights. Reliance can be placed on Ramhari Mandal v. Nilmoni Das 
AIR (39) 1952 Cal. 184, Bhaurao Atmaram Patil  v. Sub-Divisional 
Officer, Chandur-Morsi and another AIR 1955 Nag. 1, Nasirabad 
properties Ltd. v. Chittagong Development Authority and another 
PLD 1966 Dacca 472. Besides, it has been held in the judgments 
reported as The Municipal Board, Manglaur v. Mahadeoji Maharaj 
AIR 1965 SC 1147, Pakistan National Oils and another v. Sattar 
Muhammad 1980 SCMR 686 and Lahore Cantonment Cooperative 
Housing Society Limited through Secretary v. Messrs Builders and 
Developers (Pvt.) Ltd. and another PLD 1999 Lah. 305, that access 
by a person from public road cannot be curtailed and in our view on

account of the action of the respondents, not only that the 
appellant’s fundamental right has been breached, but his right to 
way has been violated. Therefore, while allowing this Intra Court 
Appeal, the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge is 
set aside, the action of the respondents in fixing/installing the 
wire/hedge across the frontage of the appellant’s land is declared as 
without lawful authority, with the direction to the respondents to 
remove the wire/hedge with immediate effect.” 
 
In another case cited as Muhammad Saleem Chaudhry Vs. 
Defence Housing Authority, Commercial Area through Secretary 
and 4 others (2009 MLD 720) wherein the Defence Housing 
Authority without the consent of the owner and without 
purchasing and acquisitioning got possession of land and this 
Court held such act of the authority as void and unlawful and 
directed to restore the possession of the land or pay compensation 
by holding as under: 
“6. As to whether relief can be granted in this writ petition, learned 
counsel for the petitioner has cited the cases of District Officer 
Revenue, Kasur v. Abdul Rehmat Shaukat (2006 SCMR 188), 
Province of Punjab through Secretary Irrigation, Govt. of the 
Punjab, Lahore and 2 others v. Abdur Rehman Shaukat (1999 
SCMR 2610) and Mst. Mukhtiar Fatima v. Deputy Commissioner, 
Multan and 2 others (1997 MLD 1792). In the said judgments the 
act of the State functionaries in taking over the land of the citizens 
and utilizing for their purpose without lawful acquisition or 
payment of compensation/consideration were declared to be void. 
7. 
For all that has been discussed above, the writ petition is 
allowed. The act of the respondents in depriving the petitioner of his 
property without his consent, proper acquisition or purchase or 
payment of compensation/consideration is declared to be without 
lawful authority and void. A mandamus is accordingly issued to the 
respondents to act in the matter in accordance with law and to 
consider the matter of payment of adequate compensation/ 
consideration to the petitioner for his land and to pay the same 
within two months from the date of this judgment and in case they 
fail to do so, to restore the possession of the land to the petitioner. 
At the moment parties are left to bear their own costs.” 
 
6.  
On 14.11.2022, Military Estate Officer, Lahore Region 
submitted report before this Court in this petition that acquisition 
process under Land Acquisition Act, 1894 would be initiated 
after the approval of the Government as well as GHQ but till to-
date, no such process has been initiated.

7. 
So far as the arguments of learned counsel for the 
respondents that the matter is factual in nature and alternate 
remedy of civil suit is available, as such instant constitutional 
petition is not maintainable. Suffice it to say in this regard that 
the petitioners are admittedly owners of the land which is in 
possession of the respondent-authorities and this fact has been 
corroborated by the lengthy correspondence of the respondent-
authorities as well as that of the revenue functionaries with the 
petitioners, and even in the report submitted to the instant petition 
by the respondents before this Court, thus no factual controversy 
is involved in this case, as such the argument of learned Law 
Officer being against the record is hereby repelled.  
8.  
Furthermore, the case of the petitioners is at par with 
Muhammad Ismail etc. whose land was situated adjacent to the 
land the petitioners and his land was also taken over by the 
respondent without payment of any compensation. Said 
Muhammad Ismail etc. filed Writ Petition No.2700/2011 in 
which this Court vide order dated 24.02.2011 passed a direction 
and in compliance whereof, his land was acquired, award No.2 
was announced on 06.02.2014 and accordingly compensation was 
paid to him, as such the petitioners are also entitled for similar 
treatment without any discrimination. 
9. 
For what has been discussed above, this writ petition is 
allowed and the respondents are directed that if the land is 
required to them then complete the process of acquisition of the 
land in question positively within three months after receipt of 
certified copy of this order, otherwise restore the possession of 
the land to the petitioners immediate after the above stipulated 
period. As the land is admittedly in possession of the respondents 
and has been leased out to some other blue-eyed persons from 
whom the respondents are receiving rental/ lease money, thus the 

 
W.P.No.251251/2018 
 
15
respondents shall pay the rent/lease of the land in question, as per 
market rate, to the petitioners from the date of taking over 
possession of the land till its acquisition or return of possession to 
the petitioners.
