Writ Petition No. 8786 of 2021 
(Samia Zaman v. Asad Zaman and another) 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
Date of hearing: 
 
15.11.2023 
 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Muhammad Naveed Sheikh, Advocate.  
 
Respondents by: 
Respondent No. 1  ex parte.  
 
 
 
 
Faisal Zaman Khan, J.  Through this petition, 
judgment dated 19.01.2021 passed by respondent no.2 has been assailed, 
by virtue of which an appeal filed by respondent no.1 has been accepted.   
 
2. 
 
The facts giving rise to the present petition are that 
marriage was solemnized between one Mst. Rukhsana Kauser and 
respondent no.1 on 20.02.2000. Out of the wedlock, petitioner was born. 
Due to altercation between the spouses, a suit for recovery of 
maintenance allowance was filed by the petitioner against respondent 
no.1. Mst. Rukhsana Kausar also filed suits for recovery of maintenance 
allowance and dowry articles against the said respondent. Through a 
consolidated judgment and decrees dated 24.03.2016 these suits were 
decreed and while decreeing the suit of the petitioner,  she was held 
entitled to maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.5,000/- per month 
from the date of her birth till her legal entitlement with 15% annual 
increase. Feeling aggrieved, respondent No.1 by way of filing an appeal 
assailed the judgment and decree passed in favour of the petitioner, 
whereas Mst. Rukhsana Kausar filed a separate appeal against judgment 
and decrees passed in her favour. Vide consolidated judgment and 
decrees dated 20.09.2016 the appeal filed by the petitioner was 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 8786/2021

dismissed whereas, while accepting the appeal filed by Mst. Rukhsana 
Kausar, the decrees passed in her favour were modified. Feeling 
dissatisfied of dismissal of his appeal, respondent no.1 filed Writ 
Petition No.6400/2017 which was dismissed through order dated 
05.11.2018, subsequent to which execution proceedings were initiated 
by the petitioner, during the course of which a question arose, as to from 
which date annual increase of 15% has to be made applicable. Vide order 
dated 16.10.2020 the executing court held that since the petitioner has 
been held entitled to maintenance allowance from her date of her birth, 
therefore, the annual increase of 15% shall be made applicable from that 
date and not from the date of decree. Feeling aggrieved, respondent no.1 
preferred an appeal, which was accepted through the impugned 
judgment and 15% annual increase was made applicable from the date of 
decree, hence this petition.  
 
3. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that when the 
petitioner was held entitled to arrears of maintenance allowance, the 
annual increase of 15% had to be made applicable from that very date 
and not from the date of decree, thus, respondent no.2 has erred in law in 
holding that the annual increase shall be made applicable from the date 
of decree.  
 
4. 
 
Despite 
service 
through 
publication, 
none 
entered 
appearance on behalf of respondent no.1, therefore, vide order dated 
22.06.2020, he was proceeded against ex parte.  
 
5. 
 
Argument heard. Record perused. 
 
 
6. 
 
The sole point which requires determination by this Court is 
as to from which date, 15% annual increase as contemplated in judgment 
and decree dated 24.03.2016 passed by the Family Court shall be made 
applicable, i.e. from the date of decree or from the date when the 
petitioner is held entitled to arrears of maintenance allowance.

A JUDGMENT has been defined in Section 2(9) of the 
Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (CPC): 
“Judgment” means the statement given by the judge of 
the grounds of a decree or order.” 
 
Similarly a DECREE has been defined in Section 2(2) CPC: 
 
"Decree" means the formal expression of an 
adjudication which, so far as regards the court 
expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the 
parties with regard to all or any of the matters in 
controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or 
final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a 
plaint the determination of any question within section 
144 and an order under rule 60, 98, 99, 101 or 103 of 
Order XXI] but shall not include-----  
 
(a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an 
appeal from an order, or  
(b) any order of dismissal for default.  
 
Explanation. - A decree is preliminary when further 
proceedings have to be taken before the suit can be 
completely dispose of. It is final when such adjudication 
completely disposes of the suit. It may be partly 
preliminary and partly final.  
 
Apart from the above, an ORDER has also been defined in Section 
2(14) CPC which for convenience is reproduced asunder:  
“Order” means the formal expression of any decision of 
a Civil Court which is not a decree: 
 
8. 
 
Order XX Rule 4 CPC explains what the ingredients of a 
judgment, which for convenience of reference is reproduced below:  
4. 
Judgments 
of 
Small 
Cause 
Courts---(1) 
Judgments of a Court of Small Causes need not contain 
more than the points for determination and the decision 
thereon. 
 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 8786/2021 
 
 
 
4
 Judgments of other Courts.---(2) Judgments of other 
Courts shall contain a concise statement of the case, the 
points for determination, the decision thereon, and the 
reasons for such decision.  
 
9. 
 
In Order XLI Rule 31 CPC expression Judgment passed 
by an Appellate Court has been explained amplifying the necessary 
ingredients of a judgment, which for convenience is reproduced asunder:  
“R.31. Contents, date and signature of Judgment.—
The judgment of the Appellate Court shall be in 
writing and shall state--- 
(a) 
the points for determination; 
(b) 
the decision thereon; 
(c) 
the reasons for the decision; and,  
(d) 
where the decree appealed from is reversed or 
varied, the relief to which the appellant is 
entitled;  
and shall at the time it is pronounced be signed 
and dated by the Judge or by the Judges 
concurring therein. 
 
10. 
 
The cumulative reading of the above provisions would 
show that a judgment/order passed by a Court or forum “SHALL” 
contain the following: 
a. 
concise statement of case; 
b. 
the points for determination;  
c. 
Finding on each point pressed/argued by the 
parties; and 
d. 
the reasons for the decision.

While giving guide lines for a JUDGMENT passed by the 
courts/forums Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in judgment 
reported as Messrs MFMY Industries Ltd. and others v. Federation of 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 8786/2021

Pakistan through Ministry of Commerce and others (2015 SCMR 1550) 
has held as follows: 
 
“5.  Termination of a lis undoubtedly is through a 
verdict of a court which is a decision disposing of a 
matter in dispute before it (the Court) and in legal 
parlance, it is called a “JUDGMENT”. It is invariably 
known that a judge finally speaks through his 
judgment. According to Black’s Law Dictionary, a 
judgment has been defined to mean “A court’s final 
determination of the rights and obligations of the 
parties in a case” and per Henry Campbell Black, A 
treatise on the Law of Judgment “An action is 
instituted for the enforcement of a right or the redress 
of an injury. Hence a judgment, as the culmination of 
the action declares the existence of the right, 
recognizes the commission of the injury, or negatives 
the allegation of one or the other. But as no right can 
exist without a correlative duty, nor any invasion of it 
without a corresponding obligation to make amends, 
the judgment necessarily affirms, or else denies, that 
such a duty or such a liability rests upon the person 
against whom the aid of the law is invoked”. These 
definitions are adequately self-explanatory. In our 
procedural law (civil), judgment as defined in Section 
2(9) of Code of Civil Procedure means “the statement 
given by the judgment of the grounds of a decree or 
order”. It should be emphasized here that a judgment 
should supply adequate reasons for the conclusion 
reached and arrived at and should be reflective of 
application of proper judicial mind by the Judge and it 
should not be a mechanical and not speaking judgment 
in nature.  
It may be reiterated that without a judgment, 
there is no concept of justice and/or fruitful outcome of 
litigation which without any fear of contradiction 
means that the State lacks an effective justice system. 
In such a situation, I would, rather, go to the extent of 
saying that if the Judge/the Court does not pronounce 
a judgment for resolving the legal and factual issues 
involved in a dispute before it at all, the very purpose 
of the judicial branch of the State will be frustrated 
and eroded. If there is no judgment in terms of law, the 
entire judicial setup shall be rendered farce and 
illusionary, which obviously shall in turn disturb the 
equilibrium between the pillars of the State upon

which it rests, resulting into serious impairment of the 
functioning of the State.” 
 
12. 
In another judgment, reported as Raja Muhammad Afzal v. 
Ch. Muhammad Altaf Hussain and others (1986 SCMR 1736) the Apex 
Court has observed as follows: 
 
“ ‘Judgment’ has been defined in section 2, clause (9) 
of the Civil Procedure Code as judgment’ means the 
statement given by the Judge of the grounds of a 
decree or order and Order has been defined in clause 
14 of the same section as formal expression of any 
decision of a civil Court which is not a decree’. 
Further, Order XX, Rule 4, sub-rule  (2) prescribes 
that judgment of Courts other than the Court of a 
small causes’ shall contain a concise statement of the 
case, the points for determination, the decision 
thereon, and the reasons for such decision’. Rule 5 of 
the same Order provides in suits in which issues have 
been framed the Court shall state its finding or 
decision with reasons. Therefore, upon each separate 
issue, unless the finding upon any one or more of the 
issues sufficient for the decision of the suit.” 
 
13. 
 
The afore-noted view has also been followed in recent 
judgments reported as Mst. Sarwar Bano through Attorney v. Province 
of Sindh through Member Board of Revenue, Hyderabad and 5 others 
[PLD 2015 Sindh 445], Ali Noor (Pvt.) Ltd. through Authorized person 
v. Trading Corporation of Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief 
Executive/Director [PLD 2015 Sindh 451] and Ghous Bakhsh v. Syed 
Ali Nawaz Shah and 8 others [PLD 2014 Sindh 306].  
 
14. 
 
With regard to applicability of an order/judgment/decree, it 
has been held in judgments reported as Zari Taraqiati Bank Limited 
through President and others v. Sarfraz Khan Jadoon and others [2023 
PLC (CS) 724], Muhammad Farooq through legal heirs and others v. 
Muhammad Hussain and others [2013 SCMR 225], Muhammad Younis 
and others v. Essa Jan and others [2009 SCMR 1169] and Mst. Attiyya 
Bibi Khan and others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary of 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 8786/2021

Education (Ministry of Education), Civil Secretariat, Islamabad and 
others 
[2001 
SCMR 
1161] 
that 
the 
applicability 
of 
the 
order/judgment/decree will be prospective unless through a clear and 
categoric direction, it is made applicable retrospectively. 
  
15. 
 
Placing the above exposition in juxtaposition with the facts 
of the present case, it has surfaced that although a judgment and decree 
qua recovery of past and future maintenance allowance has been passed 
in favour of the petitioner yet no such direction has been issued therein, 
wherefrom it can be culled out that 15% annual increase has been made 
applicable from the date when the arrears of maintenance allowance 
have been granted to the petitioner. Had this been the intention of the 
family court, it would have given a categoric and unequivocal finding in 
this regard (backed by reasons), therefore, keeping in view the 
interpretation that applicability of order/judgment/decree will be 
prospective in nature and finding qua an issue has to be categoric, hence 
it is held that the finding of the family court with regard to applicability 
of annual increase of 15% was from the date of decree and not from the 
date when the arrears were granted. 
 
16. 
 
It shall not be out of place to mention here that when a 
decree of recovery of maintenance allowance is passed by a family 
court, under section 17-A (2) of the Family Courts Act 1964 (Act), a 
family court has to fix the amount of maintenance allowance, which can 
either be the amount asked for in a suit or a higher amount keeping in 
view the facts and circumstances of the case. Apart from this it will also 
prescribe an appropriate annual increase in the quantum of the 
maintenance allowance determined. It has also been narrated in section 
17-A (3) of the Act that where no annual increase is suggested, it shall 
automatically stand increased at the rate of 10% each year. 
 
17. 
 
The above provisions of the Act further fortify the view 
taken by this Court that although a family court while decreeing a suit 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 8786/2021 
 
 
 
8
qua recovery of maintenance allowance apart from determining the 
quantum of maintenance allowance will also suggest the annual increase 
however if the annual increase has to be made applicable retrospectively 
(as the relevant provision does not lay any embargo in this regard), 
keeping in view the evidence of the parties, it has to give a categoric 
finding in this regard justifying the applicability of the increase from a 
particular date otherwise if the increase is not suggested from a 
particular date or no increase is suggested, the same shall be deemed to 
be applicable from the date of decree.  
 
18. 
 
For what has been discussed above, since the learned 
counsel for the petitioner has not been able to highlight any 
jurisdictional defect or procedural impropriety in the impugned 
judgment, therefore, no ground for interference is made out, as a sequel 
to which, this petition fails and the same is dismissed.
