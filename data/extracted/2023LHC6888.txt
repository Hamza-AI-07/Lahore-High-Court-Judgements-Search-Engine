The 
petitioner 
has 
invoked 
 
constitutional 
jurisdiction of this Court to challenge the orders dated 
03.06.2022 and 31.10.2023 passed by the learned Judge 
Family Court, Lahore and the learned Additional Sessions 
Judge, Lahore respectively whereby her private complaint 
under section 6(5) of Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 
1961 (‘Ordinance’) was entertained to the extent of 
respondent Feroz Usmani and dismissed to the extent of 
remaining respondents and the criminal revision preferred 
there-against was dismissed. 
2. 
The facts giving rise to the titled petition briefly are 
that the petitioner filed a complaint under section 6(5) of 
the Ordinance accusing respondent Feroz Usmani  of  
contracting second marriage with respondent Aniqa Azam  
during subsistence of marriage with her whereas 
respondents Younas Ahmad, Muhammad Bashir Ahmad 
and Muhammad Kashif were accused of being facilitators 
and respondents Hafiz Dilawar and the Secretary, Union 
Council were accused of facilitating the offence being 
Nikah reciter and registration of the Nikah.  The Judge 
Family Court, Lahore after recording cursory evidence of 
the petitioner, summoned the accused Feroz Usmani and 
dismissed the complaint to the extent of remaining

                                    W.P.No.84511 of 2023 
respondents vide order dated 03.06.2022. Feeling 
aggrieved, the petitioner preferred criminal revision 
before the Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore which was 
dismissed vide order dated 31.10.2023 impugned herein.   
3. 
While 
dismissing 
criminal 
revision 
of 
the 
petitioner, the Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore recorded 
following reasons: - 
“3. 
Application of mind by the Magistrate before 
issuance of process means that Magistrate has to satisfy 
himself while going through the available record that trial 
of respondents is necessary and only then further 
proceedings are to be undertaken against the respondents 
then the Magistrate would issue process to summon the 
respondents.  Courts cannot be expected to act like silent 
spectators, rather, precedents of the Honourable Superior 
Courts of Pakistan impel subordinate Courts to nip the evil 
in the bud.  Mere institution of private complaint and 
recording of cursory evidence does not absolve complainant 
to bring on record the sufficient material justifying the 
summoning of record.  No incriminating material is 
available on record against the respondents to summon 
them.  Private complaint and the cursory statements do not 
support the version of complainant to the extent of 
involvement of respondents in the instant case. Impugned 
order is well-reasoned and unexceptionable.”  
 
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the 
impugned orders are against the law and facts of the case.  
He maintains that sufficient evidence in the shape of 
second Nikahnama was available to proceed against the 
respondents/accused but the same has been ignored by 
both the Courts below.  He further contends that no solid 
reason has been recorded in the impugned orders 
explaining refusal to summon the respondents-accused 
except Feroz Usmani.  
 
5. 
Heard.   
6.   
The complaint filed against any accused must state 
the facts disclosing existence of both the unlawful act and 
the criminal intent so that the Court may be satisfied 
regarding existence of every ingredient of the alleged 
offence.   The Court is not required to casually accept the 
written complaint until it has satisfied itself that prima

                                    W.P.No.84511 of 2023 
facie the case has been made out against the persons who 
have been accused of the criminal offence.  In order to 
arrive at just evaluation, the Court ordinarily examines the 
complainant and the witnesses as cursory evidence.  The 
purpose behind that practice is to protect the public from 
false and frivolous complaints filed against them in 
criminal Courts.

The subject of polygamy is governed by the 
provisions of section 6 of the Ordinance. In order to 
properly adjudicate upon the plea taken by the petitioner,  
it would be advantageous to refer to the text of the 
relevant provisions of the aforementioned section which 
are reproduced herein below: - 
“6. Polygamy. (1) No man, during the subsistence of an 
existing marriage, shall except with the previous 
permission in writing of the Arbitration Council, contract 
another marriage, nor shall any such marriage contracted 
without such permission be registered under this 
Ordinance.  
(2) …….  
(3) …….  
(4) …….  
(5) Any man who contracts another marriage without the 
permission of the Arbitration Council shall,  
(a) pay immediately the entire amount of the dower 
whether prompt or deferred, due to the existing wife or 
wives, which amount, if not so paid, shall be recoverable as 
arrears of land revenue; and  
(b) on conviction upon complaint be punishable with the 
simple imprisonment which may extend to one year, or with 
fine which may extend to five thousand rupees, or with 
both.” 
 
From perusal of above provisions of law, it is manifest 
that according to sub-section (1) of section 6 ibid, no man, 
during the subsistence of an existing marriage, shall, 
except with the previous permission in writing of the 
Arbitration Council, contract another marriage, nor shall 
any such marriage contracted without such permission be 
registered under the Ordinance whereas sub-section (5) of 
section 6 of the Act provides penalties for contracting 
another marriage making the man liable to pay 

4 
                                    W.P.No.84511 of 2023 
immediately the entire amount of the dower, whether 
prompt or deferred, due to existing wife or wives, if not so 
paid, recoverable as arrears of land revenue and on 
conviction be punishable with simple imprisonment which 
may extend to simple imprisonment of one year, or with 
fine which may extend to five thousand rupees, or with 
both. It is pertinent to note that section 6 ibid neither 
makes the registration of another marriage contracted 
without permission of the Arbitration Council an offence 
nor the Ordinance prescribes any inchoate offence in 
relation to polygamy such as attempt, solicitation or 
conspiracy.  Section 6 of the Ordinance does not prescribe 
any punishment or penalty against anyone other than the 
husband who contracts another marriage without 
permission of the Arbitration Council concerned.  
8. 
It is a cardinal principle of interpretation of criminal 
statutes that enactments prescribing an offence are to be 
construed strictly and the words used therein cannot be 
extended by construction.  In the case of Mirza Shaukat 
Baig and others vs. Shahid Jamil and others (PLD 2005 
Supreme Court 530), the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
quoted with approval the following passage of lord 
Halsbury from the English judgments reported as (1891) 
AC 107 and (1952) AC 189: 
“It seems to me that, construing the statute by adding to it 
words which are neither found therein nor for which 
authority could be found in the language of the statute 
itself, is to sin against one of the most familiar rules of 
construction, and I am wholly unable to adopt the view 
that, where a statute is expressly said to codify the law, you 
are at liberty to go outside of the code so created, because 
before the existence of that code another law prevailed. In 
the construction of statute the duty of the Court is limited to 
interpret the words used by the legislature and it has no 
power to fill in any gaps disclosed. To do so would we do 
use of the function of the legislature”. 
   
9. 
For being a special statute, in the absence of any 
specific 
provision 
in 
the 
Ordinance 
permitting 

5 
                                    W.P.No.84511 of 2023 
applicability of the Pakistan Penal Code, provisions such 
as section 109 of the PPC for the offence of abetment 
cannot be read into and made applicable to broaden scope 
of the offence prescribed under section 6(5) of the 
Ordinance. Reliance in this regard is placed on the cases 
of Ex-Lance Naik Mukarram Hussain and others v. 
Federal Government , Ministry of Defence through Chief 
of Army Staff and others (2017 SCMR 580) and Basharat 
Iqbal v. Nargis Rehana (1993 MLD 571).     
10. 
The complaint in hand does not disclose 
commission of any offence, much less the offence 
prescribed under section 6(5) of the Ordinance allegedly 
committed by any of the respondents except Feroz 
Usmani who, being accused of contracting another 
marriage without permission of Arbitration Council, has 
been lawfully summoned by the Court of competent 
jurisdiction. Learned counsel of the petitioner has not 
been able to point out what offence, if any disclosed in the 
complaint filed by the petitioner, is prima facie made out 
against other respondents.           
11. 
For the foregoing reasons, this Court does not find 
any illegality or jurisdictional error in the impugned 
orders passed by the Courts below warranting interference 
in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. This 
petition is accordingly dismissed in limine being devoid of 
any merit.
