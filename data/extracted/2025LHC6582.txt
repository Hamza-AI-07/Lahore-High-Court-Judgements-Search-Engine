JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
 
 
SYED AHSAN RAZA KAZMI, J. The present appeal brings into focus a 
recurring and important question what is the legal effect of an appeal filed within 
limitation but unaccompanied by court-fee? Some courts, adopting a strict view, treat 
such appeals as not properly instituted and dismiss them as time-barred. Others, 
following an equitable interpretation, allow the deficiency to be made good under 
Sections 148 and 149 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“the Code”), even after 
expiry of limitation. Between these two approaches lies a middle course, wherein courts 
recognize their discretion to condone the defect, but confine such discretion to a narrowly 
defined temporal window. This judgment, therefore, seeks to answer the above question. 
2. 
The facts are straightforward. The respondent/plaintiff filed a suit for specific 
performance of a contract of sale dated 06.07.2009. The suit was decreed by the learned 
Civil Judge, 1st Class, Kabirwala, on 24.03.2016. The appellant, aggrieved, filed an 
appeal before the learned Additional District Judge on 22.04.2016, well within the period 
of limitation. However, the memorandum of appeal was not accompanied by the requisite 
court-fee. The learned appellate court, instead of requiring the appellant to supply the 
deficiency, dismissed the appeal on 27.06.2016, holding that payment of court-fee 
beyond limitation could not relate back to the original date of filing. It is this order which 
now stands challenged.

3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the learned lower appellate Court 
has fallen in error in dismissing the appeal without affording the appellant an opportunity 
to make good the deficiency of court-fee as envisaged under Section 149 of the Code. It 
is contended that the said provision vests ample discretion in the Court to permit payment 
of the deficient court-fee at any stage of the proceedings and that such discretion has not 
been exercised in the present case. According to the learned counsel, the impugned 
judgment is thus unsustainable in law, having resulted in the denial of a vested statutory 
right of appeal, and deserves to be set aside. Reliance on various judgments has been 
placed1. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has opposed the arguments 
advanced on behalf of the appellant and submits that the impugned judgment suffers from 
no legal infirmity. It is contended that several authoritative precedents recognize the 
competence of a Court to dismiss an appeal which is not accompanied by the prescribed 
court-fee, such appeal being rendered incompetent and barred by limitation. Learned 
counsel maintains that the lower appellate Court, in declining to exercise discretion under 
Section 149 of the Code, has acted within the parameters of law, and its decision is thus 
supported by well-settled judicial precedents. It is therefore prayed that the impugned 
judgment be upheld and the appeal dismissed. Reliance of various judgments has been 
placed2. 
5. 
I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and perused the 
record carefully. 
6. 
Building on these contentions, the pivotal question of law that arises for 
determination in this appeal is whether a plaint or memorandum of appeal filed without 
the requisite court-fee is void ab initio or merely defective and capable of validation 
under Section 149 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; and further, whether payment 
of the deficient court-fee at a subsequent stage operates retrospectively to validate its 
institution from the date of presentation.

7. 
The persistence of conflicting judicial interpretations on this subject may be traced 
to the interplay between Section 149 C.P.C., Order VII Rule 11(c), the Court-Fees Act, 
1870, and the Limitation Act, 1908. While Section 149 recognizes the curability of a 
deficient court-fee and empowers the Court to regularize the defect retrospectively, Order 
VII Rule 11(c) authorizes rejection of a plaint if the prescribed fee is not paid within the 
time granted. The Court-Fees Act embodies the fiscal dimension of the issue, treating 
payment as a matter between the litigant and the State, whereas the Limitation Act 
governs the temporal dimension of the right to sue or appeal. The tension arises when 
these statutes are applied in isolation rather than in harmony — one emphasizing 
procedural rigidity, the other discretionary equity. To resolve this, the reconciliation of 
these provisions, therefore, requires a purposive construction that preserves both fiscal 
discipline and substantive justice, ensuring that a procedural omission does not eclipse a 
vested right. 
8. 
With this foundation in mind, the question must be examined in the context of the 
scheme of the Code. Sections 148 and 149 of the Code are of particular relevance.  
Section 148 – Enlargement of time 
Where any period is fixed or granted by the Court for the doing of any act 
prescribed or allowed by this Code, the Court may, in its discretion, from 
time to time, enlarge such period, even though the period originally fixed 
or granted may have expired. 
 
Section 149 – Power to make up deficiency of court-fees 
Where the whole or any part of any fee prescribed for any document by the 
law for the time being in force relating to court-fees has not been paid, the 
Court may, in its discretion, at any stage, allow the person by whom such 
fee is payable to pay the whole or part, as the case may be, of such court-
fee; and upon such payment the document, in respect of which such fee is 
payable, shall have the same force and effect as if such fee had been paid 
in the first instance. 
 
Section 148 empowers a Court to enlarge the period prescribed for doing an act required 
by the Code, even after expiry of the original period. Section 149 confers upon the Court 
the discretion to allow payment of the whole or any part of the court-fee at any stage, and 
expressly provides that upon such payment, “the document shall have the same force and 
effect as if such fee had been paid in the first instance.” The deeming clause thus 
introduced creates a legal fiction of retrospective validation, signifying that the institution 
of a plaint or appeal is not void for want of court-fee but remains incomplete until the 
deficiency is supplied. The underlying intent of the legislature is remedial — to advance 
justice by curing procedural irregularities rather than defeating substantive rights on 
technical grounds. 

-4- 
                RSA.No. 188 of 2016 
 
 
The words “at any stage” and “same force and effect” are the keys to 
understanding this provision. It is a curative provision — not merely procedural, but 
remedial, designed to protect litigants from technical fatality where intent to pursue a 
remedy exists but compliance with fiscal formality is deficient. 
9. 
To achieve coherence, the harmonization of Section 149 of the Code with other 
provisions of the Code and allied enactments is essential to dispel the ambiguity that has 
surrounded its practical application. The apparent conflict between the liberal curative 
intent of Section 149 and the strict procedural mandates contained in Order VII Rule 
11(c), the Court-Fees Act, 1870, and the Limitation Act, 1908 has led to inconsistent 
judicial outcomes. A coordinated interpretation alone can preserve the legislative 
equilibrium—ensuring that procedural law functions as a facilitator of justice rather than 
an instrument of technical defeat. When read harmoniously, these provisions form an 
integrated scheme that promotes fiscal responsibility, respects limitation, and at the same 
time safeguards the substantive right of appeal. The task of the Court, therefore, is to 
reconcile rather than compartmentalize these provisions, giving effect to the legislative 
purpose in its entirety. 
10. 
It is by now well settled that provisions of Order VII Rule 11(C) are also 
applicable to appeals under the Code. The apparent tension between Section 149 and 
Order VII Rule 11(c) of the Code is more illusory than real. Order VII Rule 11(c) 
mandates that where the relief claimed is properly valued but the court-fee paid is 
insufficient, the Court shall fix a time for payment of the deficiency and reject the plaint 
only upon non-compliance. Section 149, on the other hand, empowers the Court to permit 
payment of the fee at any stage and, upon such payment, retrospectively validates the 
document. Read together, these provisions reveal a complementary legislative design: 
Rule 11(c) provides the procedural mechanism for affording opportunity, while Section 
149 provides the substantive authority to regularize the document once compliance is 
achieved. The rejection contemplated by Rule 11(c) thus operates only when the litigant, 
despite opportunity under Section 149, fails to comply within the time prescribed. The 
two provisions must therefore be construed as mutually reinforcing—ensuring both 
procedural discipline and remedial flexibility. 
11. 
Having examined the internal mechanics of the Code, it becomes necessary to 
explore its harmony with the Limitation Act, 1908. The relationship between Section 149 
of the Code and the Limitation Act is defined by the principle that limitation governs 
institution, not perfection. When a plaint or appeal is filed within the period of limitation, 
the right of action or appeal stands preserved. The absence or deficiency of court-fee does 
not render the filing void; rather, it creates an irregularity which the Court may allow to 

-5- 
                RSA.No. 188 of 2016 
 
 
be cured under Section 149 ibid. The deeming clause—“shall have the same force and 
effect as if such fee had been paid in the first instance”—establishes the doctrine of 
relation back, by which payment of the fee subsequently relates to the date of filing. 
Consequently, an appeal filed within time but deficient in court-fee cannot be dismissed 
as time-barred once the deficiency is supplied within the period granted by the Court. 
Only where the initial filing itself is beyond limitation, or where the deficiency is not 
remedied despite opportunity, does the bar of limitation revive. This construction 
preserves the finality of limitation while preventing its misuse as a technical weapon to 
defeat bona fide claims. The celebrated decision in Stuart Skinner alias Nawab Mirza 
(1879)3 remains instructive even after more than one and a quarter century, for it 
illuminates the very features that continue to animate this controversy even today. The 
Court in that case pertinently observed that if the law of limitation is ever to be applied in 
matters relating to court fee, it must be done expressly and unambiguously through clear 
statutory language within the enactment governing the subject. The underlying rationale 
of that pronouncement suggests that Section 149 of the Code embodies an independent 
and discretionary power of the Court—its operation is not controlled by the Limitation 
Act, for it serves to cure procedural defects rather than to condone delay. It has already 
been held by the August Supreme Court in the case of Siddique Khan Vs. Abdul Shakur 
Khan (PLD 1984 SC 289) that in considering the options for exercise of discretion for 
grant of time for supply of deficiency in the court fee, considerations relevant to bar of 
limitation shall not be taken into account. 
12. 
Turning to the fiscal dimensions, the Court-Fees Act, 1870 regulates the fiscal 
obligation of a litigant towards the State. Its object is revenue-oriented, not punitive. The 
payment of court-fee is a matter between the State and the suitor; it does not affect the 
jurisdiction of the Court or the adversary’s substantive rights. Section 149 of the Code, 
when read with Sections 12 and 28 of the Court-Fees Act, ensures that deficiency in fee, 
when paid under judicial direction, satisfies the statutory requirement in full measure. 
The conjoint reading of these provisions reveals that the legislature intended the 
collection of revenue without obstruction of justice. Therefore, where the omission is 
bona fide and subsequently rectified, the payment made under Section 149 not only 
discharges the fiscal liability but also cures the procedural defect retrospectively. The 
focus must remain on substantial compliance with fiscal law rather than mechanical 
forfeiture of the litigant’s right of remedy. Non-payment or belated payment of court fees 
does not adversely affect the interest of the opposite party4.

13. 
Having established these harmonies, the discretion vested in the Court under 
Section 149 of the Code is not merely permissive; it is a judicial obligation to be 
exercised in furtherance of justice. The provision embodies a legislative recognition that 
inadvertent or bona fide procedural lapses should not extinguish substantive rights. The 
Court, therefore, ought to exercise its discretion liberally where the appeal or plaint has 
been filed within limitation and the omission to affix the prescribed court-fee is neither 
willful nor motivated by malafide intent. The object of the provision is remedial—to 
enable the litigant to perfect an imperfect act, not to punish him for an honest error. To 
refuse this discretion in deserving cases would be to defeat the very spirit of Section 149, 
which seeks to balance fiscal discipline with equitable justice. It is thus the duty of the 
Court to distinguish between genuine inadvertence and deliberate disregard, extending 
the protection of Section 149 to the former while withholding it from the latter. In this 
manner, judicial discretion under Section 149 operates as an instrument of fairness—
ensuring that procedure serves justice, not the reverse. At least, one opportunity in 
exercise of said powers should be granted to the appellant. Reliance is placed on the case 
of Muhammad Hanif and others vs. Muhammad and others (PLD 1990 SC 859).  
14. 
Yet, this discretion is not without limits, the discretion conferred by Section 149 of 
the Code is equitable and not unqualified. It is intended to assist the diligent, not to 
absolve the negligent. The Court is under no obligation to exercise such discretion in 
favour of a litigant who displays contumacious conduct, lack of bona fides, or persistent 
disregard of judicial directions. Where an appellant, despite having been granted specific 
time and opportunity to affix the requisite court-fee, willfully defaults or remains 
indifferent to compliance, the Court justifiably declines indulgence. Similarly, where the 
appeal itself is presented beyond limitation, the defect is not procedural but jurisdictional, 
and Section 149 cannot be invoked to resuscitate a barred cause. Courts are also entitled 
to refuse relief where the omission to pay court-fee is motivated by mala fide intent, 
deliberate evasion of revenue, or reckless abuse of process. In such situations, dismissal 
of the appeal—whether as incompetent, non-maintainable, or time-barred—is not 
punitive but a legitimate assertion of procedural discipline. The benevolence of Section 
149 ends where indifference or dishonesty begins. 
15.  
In the case of Assistant Commissioner & L.A.C., Badin v. Haji Abdul Shakoor 
(1997 SCMR 919), the august Supreme Court held that where an appellant knowingly 
filed an appeal with deficient court-fee and delayed compliance even after objection, such 
behaviour reflected reckless indifference and bad faith, disentitling the party from judicial 
indulgence. Likewise, in the case of Province of Punjab v. Nisar-ul-Haq Associates 
(1998 MLD 589), this Court characterized a two-year delay in affixing the proper stamps 

-7- 
                RSA.No. 188 of 2016 
 
 
as definitely contumacious, rejecting the plea that financial sanction from the 
Government could justify the lapse. The Court emphasized that Section 149 C.P.C. 
protects bona fide omissions, not habitual or deliberate defiance of legal duty. Similarly, 
in the case of Muhammad Tariq v. Amjad Ali (PLD 2018 Lahore 502), the petitioners 
were found both negligent and contumacious for leaving the appeal pending for more 
than two years and ten months without rectifying the deficiency, despite repeated 
opportunities. The Court reaffirmed that the discretion under Section 149 of the Code is 
confined to genuine oversight and cannot be extended to those who, by willful inaction 
and procedural disregard, frustrate the administration of justice. 
16. 
Drawing from these illustrations, the legal position on this subject now stands 
crystallized through a consistent line of authority from the superior Courts. In the case of 
Habib Akbar v. Pir Azam Syed (2017 YLR 26 [Peshawar]), it was held that once an 
appeal is filed within limitation and notice has been issued, it cannot be dismissed merely 
for non-affixation of court-fee—the omission being a curable defect. The Court must, 
either on application or suo motu, determine whether time should be extended under 
Section 149 of the Code or Sections 12 and 28 of the Court Fees Act, 1870. Earlier, in the 
case of Siddique Khan v. Abdul Shakur Khan (supra), the august Supreme Court 
emphasized that a litigant is entitled as of right to at least one effective opportunity to 
make good the deficiency of court-fee, specifying both the amount and the period of 
compliance, and that dismissal without granting such opportunity vitiates the order. The 
same principle was reaffirmed in the case of Syed Zahid Hussain Shah v. Mumtaz Ali 
(PLD 2023 SC 470), wherein it was observed that the object of the Court Fees Act is to 
secure revenue for the State, not to furnish a weapon of technicality to one litigant against 
another, and that non-payment of court-fee neither prejudices the adversary nor 
extinguishes a substantive right when the omission is bona fide. 
17. 
This liberal interpretation, however, is balanced by the discipline recognized in the 
case of Kh. Muhammad Fazil v. Mumtaz Munnawar Khan Niazi (2024 SCMR 1059), 
holding that once a time-bound opportunity under Section 149 C.P.C. is granted and the 
litigant defaults, the order becomes conditional and the Court thereafter is functus officio. 
Likewise, the cases of Sardar Muhammad Kazim Ziauddin Durrani v. Sardar 
Muhammad Asim Durrani (2001 SCMR 148) and Provincial Government of Balochistan 
v. Abdullah Jan (2009 SCMR 1378) reiterate that payment of court-fee is a fiscal matter 
between the litigant and the State; it neither affects the Court’s jurisdiction nor the 
adversary’s rights, and procedural rules must be interpreted to advance, not obstruct, 
justice. 

-8- 
                RSA.No. 188 of 2016 
 
 
Read conjointly, these precedents affirm that where an appeal is instituted within 
limitation, the absence or deficiency of court-fee does not invalidate its presentation. The 
defect is curable under Sections 148 and 149 of the Code; the appeal relates back upon 
payment, and dismissal on limitation is justified only when the filing itself was belated or 
the omission deliberate and contumacious. 
 18. 
In light of this crystalized position, the duty of the Court under Section 149 is not 
merely discretionary—it carries a degree of judicial compulsion. The Supreme Court in 
Siddique Khan’s case (supra) held that in every case where a document is insufficiently 
stamped, the Court must grant at least one effective opportunity to the litigant to make 
good the deficiency, clearly indicating both the amount due and the time allowed for 
compliance. Dismissal without affording such opportunity vitiates the order for want of 
lawful exercise of jurisdiction. 
Thus, the Court is obligated to distinguish between inadvertence and indifference. 
A litigant’s bonafide omission deserves indulgence; his obstinate disregard of judicial 
directions does not. 
19. 
Nevertheless, the flexibility granted under Sections 148 and 149 of the Code does 
not confer perpetual license to default. Once a time-bound direction is given for making 
up the deficiency and the litigant fails to comply, the order becomes conditional and the 
Court is rendered functus officio in respect thereof. Judicial indulgence must not dilute 
the authority of the Court or incentivize negligence. The golden mean lies between 
compassion and discipline—leniency for bona fide lapses, firmness against indifference 
or abuse. 
20. 
Synthesizing these elements, from the cumulative reading of the jurisprudence 
including the cases of Siddique Khan (supra), Habib Akbar (supra), Syed Zahid Hussain 
Shah (supra), Kh. Muhammad Fazil (supra), Sardar Muhammad Kazim Ziauddin 
Durrani (supra), and Provincial Government of Balochistan v. Abdullah Jan (2009 
SCMR 1378), the following principles emerge: 
i. 
Filing within limitation preserves the right of appeal; non-
affixation of court-fee at the initial stage is a procedural 
irregularity, not a jurisdictional defect. 
ii. 
The Court must, at least once, exercise discretion under Section 
149 of the Code to allow payment of deficient court-fee within a 
reasonable and specific time. 
iii. 
Upon such payment, the document relates back to the date of 
presentation and the appeal is deemed to have been validly 
instituted from that date. 
iv. 
Dismissal on technical grounds is impermissible where the 
omission is neither willful nor mala fide. 

-9- 
                RSA.No. 188 of 2016 
 
 
v. 
However, where the Court’s order fixing time is willfully 
disobeyed, indulgence ceases and the order of rejection attains 
finality. 
vi. 
The objective of court-fee law is fiscal, not penal; procedural rules 
must advance justice rather than defeat it. 
21. 
Applying these principles here, in the present matter, the appeal was filed within 
limitation. The deficiency of court-fee was procedural and not accompanied by any 
element of bad faith or deliberate delay. The lower appellate court, however, dismissed 
the appeal outright as time-barred on the sole ground that the requisite court-fee had not 
been affixed at the time of filing. Such approach betrays a misunderstanding of the 
statutory framework and conveys a mistaken impression that the discretion u/s 149 ibid is 
optional and may be bypassed altogether. This view is inconsistent with the settled 
judicial practice and the underlying scheme of the Code. Once the appeal stood filed 
within limitation, the omission to pay court-fee could be cured under Section 149 of the 
Code and the payment, when made, would relate back to the date of filing. 
The lower appellate court’s order, therefore, suffers from a jurisdictional error—
by treating a curable irregularity as a fatal defect—and amounts to a refusal to exercise 
discretion vested by law. 
22. 
The order sheet of the learned Appellate Court further reveals that the office, while 
entertaining this appeal, never raised any objection regarding the deficiency of court fee 
but proceeded to entertain it simpliciter. Since the appeal was duly received, numbered, 
and processed by the Court functionaries without objection, the appellant cannot now be 
penalized for an omission attributable to the office itself. 
23. 
Consequently, this Regular Second Appeal is allowed, the impugned order of the 
learned lower appellate court is set aside and the matter is remanded back for decision 
afresh on merits after granting the appellant an opportunity to deposit the requisite court-
fee within a period to be fixed by the Court. The learned appellate court shall conclude 
proceedings expeditiously, preferably within sixty days of receipt of this judgment. 
Office is directed to transmit a copy of this order to the Court concerned for compliance.
