Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – By this consolidated judgment, we 
shall decide Writ Petition No.24153/2023 and 22880/2023 as a common 
thread weaves through them. 
The factual background 
2. 
 
Pakistan has been in the grip of the most serious political crisis 
in its history for over a year. In a turn of events, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf 
(PTI), which was in power in the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtun Khawa, 
dissolved the provincial assemblies. PTI says that the Caretaker Cabinets 
installed under Article 224(1A) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution”), and the Federal Government run by 
Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a coalition of 11 political parties, 
have joined hands to crush it. According to the Petitioners, the Caretakers 
and the Federal Government have filed a string of false cases against the 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023 
 
- 2 - 
PTI’s leadership across the country, most notably its Chairman, Imran 
Ahmad Khan Niazi. The party’s top leadership, workers and activists are 
harassed, arrested and humiliated. 
3. 
 
The general elections for the Punjab Assembly are scheduled 
for 14.5.2023. PTI planned to take out a rally on 8.3.2023 after following 
legal formalities but, according to it, the administration was bent upon 
interrupting it and imposed restrictions under section 144 Cr.P.C. PTI 
challenged that action of the administration in this Court through Writ 
Petition No. 16122/2023. During the proceedings, the Caretakers realized 
their mistake and withdrew their notification imposing section 144 Cr.P.C. 
in the city upon which the Court disposed of the said constitutional petition 
vide Order dated 9.3.2023. 
4. 
 
The PTI workers were fully charged because of the above-
mentioned and other events in the country over the last year, including an 
assassination attempt on Imran Khan on 3.11.2022. Meanwhile, the 
Additional Sessions Judge, Islamabad (West), issued non-bailable warrants 
of arrest against Imran Khan in a case he was hearing. On 18.3.2023, the 
police arrived at Imran Khan’s residence in Zaman Park, Lahore, to 
execute the warrant. The PTI workers obstructed and battled with them. 
The city – and the world – saw ugly scenes for the next three days until this 
Court intervened in Writ Petition No. 17692/2023. Many people were 
injured, and many private and public properties were destroyed. At least 
one person, Zille Shah, was killed. There were allegations and counter-
allegations. The police registered several FIRs regarding the occurences 
during the aforementioned period. PTI also filed applications under section 
22-A(6) Cr.P.C. before the Ex-officio Justice of Peace for registration of 
FIRs/cross-versions against the members of the administration and the 
police top brass. There were loud demands for justice. In this background, 
on the request of the Inspector General of Police, Punjab, vide Order dated 
22.3.2023, the Home Department constituted a Joint Investigation Team 
(JIT) to investigate ten FIRs. The said order is Appendix-I of this petition. 
5. 
 
The Petitioners in the petitions before us are senior politicians 
holding high positions in PTI. They are either named in the FIRs 
mentioned in the Order dated 22.3.2023 or are apprehensive that they 
would be roped in during the investigation. The JIT has issued them notices 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023 
 
- 3 - 
under section 160 Cr.P.C. By this petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution, they have challenged the legality of the Order dated 
22.3.2023 (the “Impugned Order”), and seek quashing of the JIT’s 
proceedings. 
The submissions 
6. 
 
Advocate Sikandar Zulqarnain Saleem contends that, firstly, 
the concept of JIT violates both the rules of justice and the fundamental 
rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Secondly, the Provincial 
Government can form a JIT under section 19 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 
1997 (the “ATA”) only to investigate the offences under that Act. Although 
the Government accuses the Petitioners and other members/workers of PTI 
of terrorism, the contents of the FIRs listed in the Impugned Order do not 
disclose such an offence under the criteria laid down by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in Ghulam Hussain and others v. The State and others  
(PLD 2020 SC 61). Hence, including section 7 of the ATA in the FIRs is 
illegal and mala fide. Thirdly, the Government did not follow the 
prescribed procedure while issuing the Impugned Order. The Additional 
Chief Secretary (Home) issued it without the approval of the Punjab 
Provincial Cabinet which was mandatory. Fourthly, the JIT cannot 
undertake an impartial and independent investigation because two of its 
members (Imran Kishwar/SSP and Aftab Phularwan/SP) are subordinates 
of the Inspector General of Police and the Capital City Police Officer, 
Lahore, whom the PTI blames for Zille Shah’s murder. The party has 
initiated proceedings under section 22-A Cr.P.C. against them. 
7. 
 
The Respondents have strongly opposed these petitions. They 
argue that JIT is a globally recognized concept which Pakistan adopted in 
section 19 of the ATA. It does not offend any constitutional provision or 
infringe any individual’s fundamental rights. The Respondents claim that 
the violence starting 22.2.2023 caused a huge loss. It damaged public and 
private property worth crores of rupees, injured tens of police personnel, 
and killed at least one person. During the police’s attempt to execute non-
bailable warrants issued by the Islamabad Sessions Court against Imran 
Khan, the PTI workers threw petrol bombs at them, which under no 
circumstances can be justified. The Respondents contend that the 
Petitioners and those accused in the FIRs have an adequate and efficacious 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023 
 
- 4 - 
remedy before the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) under section 23 of the 
ATA. Hence, these petitions are not maintainable. Even otherwise, they are 
premature because the probe is in its early stages. The evidence gathered 
during the investigation would determine whether the accused are liable to 
be prosecuted under section 7 of the ATA. The Respondents submit that 
there is no procedural irregularity in the constitution of the JIT, and the 
allegation that its members are not independent and impartial is false. 
Notice under Order XXVII-A CPC 
8. 
 
This Court admitted these petitions to regular hearing vide 
Order dated 12.4.2023 and framed four questions of law for determination. 
Since they required interpretation of the Constitution and the statutory 
laws, it issued a notice under Order XXVII-A CPC to the Attorney General 
for Pakistan and the Advocate General Punjab. It also sought assistance 
from the Prosecutor-General Punjab. For this purpose, it issued him a 
separate notice with a direction to present his viewpoint personally. 
9. 
 
As adumbrated, four questions of law were framed originally, 
but during the hearings, a couple of additional/supplementary questions 
were deliberated. Therefore, we would also address them in this judgment. 
10. 
 
Mr Shan Gul, Advocate General Punjab, questioned the 
maintainability of these petitions. He submitted that they were barred due 
to the principle of ripeness and because the Petitioners had an adequate 
alternative remedy before the ATC under section 23 of the ATA. The 
Advocate General contended that the Petitioners’ objection to the 
formation of JIT was misconceived. It was legal under the Constitution and 
the statutory law (the ATA) and did not infringe on anybody’s fundamental 
rights. It would rather help foster justice. Mr Gul further contended that 
under section 19 of the ATA, the Provincial Government has the authority 
to form a JIT for investigating an offence which is evident from the words 
“if the Government deems necessary”. Since it is purely an administrative 
act, the Petitioners cannot challenge it, and it is not subject to judicial 
review. Furthermore, any intervention by this Court would amount to 
interference in the investigation, which the law strictly prohibits. Mr Gul 
stated that the Government meticulously followed the prescribed procedure 
while setting up the JIT for the ten cases registered between 22.2.2023 and 
19.3.2023 against the PTI leadership and workers and emphasized that the 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023 
 
- 5 - 
Impugned Order was unexceptionable. He also submitted documents to 
substantiate this plea. Mr Gul finally argued that the JIT consisted of 
honest, upright, competent senior officers. The criticism about including 
Imran Kishwar/SSP and Aftab Phularwan/SP in the JIT was unfounded. 
Their nomination could not be challenged just because they were 
subordinate to the Inspector General of Police, one of the accused in the 
PTI’s estimation. There must be something more to block them. 
11. 
 
Mr A.D. Naseem, Deputy Attorney General, adopted the 
Advocate General’s arguments. 
The submissions of the Prosecutor General Punjab 
12. 
 
Ch. Khaliq-uz-Zaman, Prosecutor General Punjab, made oral 
and written submissions. He argued that the Provincial Government had the 
authority to form a JIT under section 19 of the ATA, but it could only be 
for the offences under that Act. The police had included section 7 of the 
ATA in the subject FIRs in derogation of the law enunciated by the 
Supreme Court in Ghulam Hussain and others v. The State and others 
(PLD 2020 SC 61). It was, therefore, liable to be deleted. Once that is 
done, the legal basis for forming the JIT fades away, and the Impugned 
Order falls to the ground. The Prosecutor General submitted that, in his 
opinion, the writ petitions at hand were maintainable and this Court could 
grant the Petitioners the relief they had prayed for. 
13. 
 
Ch. Khaliq-uz-Zaman’s response evoked a strong reaction 
from the Advocate General. He argued that he was appointed during the 
PTI regime and had a tilt towards it. His views conflicted with the Punjab 
Government’s position and urged this Court to disregard them. 
14. 
 
On 20.4.2023, in pursuance of the decision of the Provincial 
Caretaker Cabinet taken in its 14th Meeting held on 20.4.2023, the Punjab 
Government restrained Ch. Khaliq-uz-Zaman from appearing in any court 
on its behalf. Confronted with this situation, he filed C.M. No.4/2023 in 
W.P. No.24153/2023 claiming that he had a statutory right of audience 
under section 6(6) of the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service 
(Constitution, Functions and Powers) Act, 2006 (the “PCPS Act”). 
Although he did not expressly request it, he wanted this Court to disregard 
the Cabinet’s decision of 20.4.2023 and consider his submissions. This 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023 
 
- 6 - 
Court issued notice to the Punjab Government on this application and 
directed it to submit a reply, which it did. 
15. 
 
The Advocate General vehemently opposed the above-
mentioned application contending that the Prosecution Service is an 
attached department of the Punjab Government and is under its control and 
administration under Serial No. 32 of the First Schedule of the Government 
of the Punjab Rules of Business, 2011. All members of the said Service, 
including the Prosecutor General, are obliged to conduct their public duties 
according to the Government’s instructions. The Advocate General further 
contended that the Prosecutor General had no authority to add or delete any 
section from the FIR. 
16. 
 
In view of the above, the issue regarding the nature and scope 
of the duties and powers of the Prosecutor General Punjab has also come 
into focus. Therefore, this judgment shall also decide it. 
Opinion 
17. 
 
The Respondents have objected to the maintainability of these 
petitions. We take up this issue first. 
Maintainability 
18. 
 
The Petitioners have challenged the formation of the JIT on 
both constitutional and statutory planes. In many ways, it is a case of first 
impression that requires a thorough examination of the law that is possible 
by a Constitutional Court. Therefore, we hold these petitions maintainable. 
19. 
 
We must, nevertheless, make a point. Section 6 of the ATA, 
which defines “terrorism” has been amended from time to time. Hence, the 
criteria for classifying an act as terrorism has been changing. In Ghulam 
Hussain and others v. The State and others (PLD 2020 SC 61),  
a 7-member Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan observed that, at one 
stage, the legislation focused on the gravity of the crime, the deadly nature 
of the weapon used, the number of perpetrators, the number of victims, the 
impact created by the offence, and the fear and insecurity that it caused or 
was likely to generate in the community. The latest definition is consistent 
with the international perception. The previous emphasis on the act’s 
speculative effect has given way to a clearly defined mens rea and actus 
reus. The amended section 6(1)(b) now specifies the “design”, and section 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023 
 
- 7 - 
6(1)(c) earmarks the “purpose,” which should be the motivation for the act. 
The actus reus has been explicitly mentioned in section 6(2)(a) to (n). As a 
result, an action can only be characterized as “terrorism” when the actus 
reus specified in section 6(2) is accompanied by the mens rea required by 
section 6(1)(b) or 6(1)(c). The fear or insecurity actually created, intended 
to be created, or likely to be created no longer determines whether an 
action qualifies as terrorism. The determinative factor now is the intent and 
motivation behind the action, regardless of whether any fear and insecurity 
were actually caused. Following the most recent amendment to section 6, 
an action is reckoned as terrorism if it “is designed to coerce and intimidate 
or overawe the Government or the public or a section of the public or 
community or sect” or if such action is intended to “create a sense of fear 
or insecurity in society” or if it is taken to advance a religious, sectarian or 
ethnic cause. It is also not terrorism when fear or insecurity is just a 
byproduct, a spillover, or an unintended consequence of a private act. In 
paragraph-16 of the judgment, the Supreme Court concluded: 
“… [F]or an action or threat of action to be accepted as terrorism within 
the meanings of section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 the action 
must fall in subsection (2) of section 6 of the said Act and the use or 
threat of such action must be designed to achieve any of the objectives 
specified in clause (b) of subsection (1) of section 6 of that Act or the use 
or threat of such action must be to achieve any of the purposes 
mentioned in clause (c) of subsection (1) of section 6 of that Act. It is 
clarified that any action constituting an offence, howsoever grave, 
shocking, brutal, gruesome or horrifying, does not qualify to be termed 
as terrorism if it is not committed with the design or purpose specified or 
mentioned in clauses (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of section 6 of the said 
Act. It is further clarified that the actions specified in subsection (2) of 
section 6 of that Act do not qualify to be labeled or characterized as 
terrorism if such actions are taken in furtherance of personal enmity or 
private vendetta.” 
20. 
 
The FIR is essentially an “incident report” which informs the 
police for the first time that an occurrence involving the commission of a 
cognizable offence has taken place.1 Rule 25.3(3) of the Police Rules, 
1934, states that the Investigating Officer must find out the truth of the 
matter under investigation, discover the actual facts, and arrest the real 
culprits. He cannot commit himself prematurely to any account of the 
incident, including the one set out in the FIR. Thus, the question whether 
the offence of terrorism has been committed in a particular case in terms of 
the law declared by the Supreme Court in Ghulam Hussain is determined

on the basis of the evidence gathered during the investigation. The 
Investigating Agency must have a free hand for this purpose. We agree 
with the Advocate General that a notice under section 160 Cr.P.C. cannot 
be challenged under Article 199 of the Constitution before the High Court 
unless it is patently illegal, mala fide, without jurisdiction or coram non 
judice. The doctrine of ripeness applies. In Sabira Khatoon v. Government 
of the Punjab and others [2021 PLC (C.S.) 1600], this Court explained: 
“Ripeness is a doctrine which courts use to enforce prudential limitations 
upon their jurisdiction’.2 It is founded on the principle that judicial 
machinery should be conserved.3 It ‘reflects concerns that courts involve 
themselves only in problems that are real and present or imminent’4 and 
should not exhaust themselves in deciding theoretical or abstract 
questions that have no impact on the parties at least for the time being.5 
This doctrine postulates that the ‘lawsuit must be well developed and 
specific and appropriate for judicial resolution. Courts may not decide 
cases that involve uncertain and contingent future events that may not 
occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.”6 
21. 
 
Section 23 of the ATA empowers the ATC to transfer cases to 
regular courts where it is of the opinion that the offence is not a scheduled 
offence. For ease of reference, section 23 is reproduced below: 
23. 
Powers to transfer cases to regular courts.– Where, after 
taking cognizance of an offence, [an Anti-Terrorism Court] is of opinion 
that the offence is not a scheduled offence, it shall, notwithstanding that 
it has no jurisdiction to try such offence, transfer the case for trial of such 
offence to any court having jurisdiction under the Code, and the court to 
which the case is transferred may proceed with the trial of the offence as 
if it had taken cognizance of the offence. 
22. 
 
The term “cognizance” in section 23 of the ATA is significant. 
In Wazir v. The State [PLD 1962 (W.P.) Lahore 405], a Full Bench of this 
Court ruled that the police report, when received by a Magistrate, does not 
constitute taking cognizance by itself. There should be something more to 
establish that the Magistrate intends to begin the proceedings. He may keep 
the case waiting until the sanction arrives, then pass some order indicating 
his intention to hold the trial. In Abdul Aziz v. Muhammad Ashraf and 
others (PLD 1973 Lahore 304), it was held that a court takes cognizance 
through a judicial action, which does not have to be formal. It occurs 
whenever the court applies its mind to the suspected commission of the

offence, as disclosed in the police report or the private complaint, to 
proceed in a specific manner following the provisions of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter referred to as the “Code or Cr.P.C.”) 
for holding an enquiry or a trial, as the case may be. In Haq Nawaz and 
others v. The State and others (2000 SCMR 785), the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan held: 
“Taking cognizance of a case by the court is the first step, which may or 
may not culminate into the trial of the accused. The trial in a criminal 
case, therefore, does not commence with the taking of the cognizance of 
the case by the court. A careful examination of the above provisions in 
the Code makes it clear that until charge is framed and copies of the 
material (statement of witnesses recorded under sections 161 and 164 
Cr.P.C., inspection note of the first visit to the place of occurrence and 
recoveries recorded by investigating officer, if the case is initiated on, 
police report, and copies of complaint, other documents filed with 
complaint and statements recorded under section 200 or 202 if it is a case 
upon complaint in writing) are supplied to accused free of charge and he 
is called upon to answer the charge.” 
23. 
 
In a nub, the court is said to have taken “cognizance of the 
case” when it applies a conscious mind and takes positive steps indicating 
that it will try the case after receiving the challan and the materials attached 
to it by the prosecution. Such steps may not be documented as judicial 
orders. What is important is that the orders so passed or actions taken 
signal that the court intends to proceed with the trial.7 
24. 
 
In Ali Gohar and others v. Pervaiz Ahmed and others  
(PLD 2020 SC 427), the Supreme Court defined the scope of section 23 of 
the ATA as follows: 
i) 
Both, the Administrative Judge and any other ATC to whom the 
case is assigned by the Administrative Judge, after taking 
‘cognizance of the case’, have the authority to transfer the case 
under section 23 to an ordinary criminal court for trial under 
Cr.P.C. 
ii) 
The authority of ATC to transfer the case under section 23 to an 
ordinary criminal court for trial under Cr.P.C. can take place after 
taking cognizance of the case, and this authority to transfer 
remains with the ATC during the proceedings of the trial till the 
judgment is announced. 
iii) 
The condition precedent for ATC to exercise the authority to 
transfer the case under section 23 of the Act are: firstly when the 
ATC takes cognizance of the case; and secondly, if ATC is of the 
opinion that the offences referred to it for trial does not come 
within the scope of offences triable under the Act. 
iv) 
The words ‘cognizance of the case’ employed in section 23 of the 
Act simply means, when the ATC, on receipt of the challan, takes 
any step indicative of proceeding with the trial.

Generally speaking, the High Court should not, while 
exercising jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution, intervene or 
otherwise comment on the applicability of section 7 of the ATA before the 
investigation is completed because it may amount to interference in the 
investigation process, which is not permissible. In Emperor v Khwaja 
Nazir Ahmed (AIR 1945 PC 18), their Lordships of the Privy Council held: 
“In their Lordships’ opinion, however, the more serious aspect of the 
case is to be found in the resultant interference by the Court with the 
duties of the police. Just as it is essential that everyone accused of a 
crime should have free access to a Court of Justice so that he may be 
duly acquitted if found not guilty of the offence with which he is 
charged, so it is of the utmost importance that the judiciary should not 
interfere with the police in matters which are within their province and 
into which the law imposes upon them the duty of enquiry. In India, as 
has been shown, there is a statutory right on the part of the police to 
investigate the circumstances of an alleged cognizable crime without 
requiring any authority from the judicial authorities, and it would, as 
their Lordships think, be an unfortunate result if it should be held 
possible to interfere with those statutory rights by an exercise of the 
inherent jurisdiction of the Court.” 
  
 
The above view was approved by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in Shahnaz Begum v. The Hon’ble Judges of the High Court of 
Sind and Baluchistan and another (PLD 1971 SC 677) and in several 
subsequent cases, including Younas Abbas and others v. Additional 
Sessions Judge, Chakwal and others (PLD 2016 SC 581). 
26. 
 
We agree with Mr Gul that, as a general principle of law, a 
litigant cannot seek judicial review if he has an alternative remedy. 
However, in order to be considered an “alternative”, the remedy must be 
convenient and efficacious. In Mehboob Ali Malik v. The Province of 
West Pakistan, and another [PLD 1963 (W.P.) Lahore 575], this Court 
explained: 
“The word ‘adequate’ signifies a concept of a relative nature. It can be 
comprehended only as a state of correspondence between one thing and 
another. A thing can be ‘adequate’, or ‘not adequate’, to something else, 
as for example ‘not adequate to the expectations, is language adequate to 
describe it’; or adequate to the disease’. When something is described as 
being adequate without indicating what it is adequate to, the context 
must supply that which has been left unstated. Therefore, the first 
question in construing the meaning of ‘adequate remedy’ is … ‘to what 
has the remedy to be adequate’? In the context, we think, the answer 
must be that the remedy has to be adequate to the requisite relief, i.e., the 
removal, or lessening of the cause of distress or anxiety, the deliverance 
from that which was burdensome. It is evident that the trouble, expense 
and delay in getting what is wanted are all as much ingredients of the 
sum total of that which can be described as ‘relief’ as the substance of 
that which is wanted.”

27. 
 
In Dr. Sher Afgan Khan Niazi v. Ali S. Habib and others 
(2011 SCMR 1813), the Supreme Court of Pakistan stated that the High 
Court should apply the following tests to determine the adequacy of an 
alternative remedy: 
(i) 
If the relief available through the alternative remedy in its nature 
or extent is not what is necessary to give the requisite relief, the 
alternative remedy is not an ‘other adequate remedy’ within the 
meaning of Article 199. 
(ii) 
If the relief available through the alternative remedy, in its nature 
and extent, is what is necessary to give the requisite relief, the 
‘adequacy’ of the alternative remedy must further be judged, with 
reference to a comparison of the speed, expense or convenience 
of obtaining that relief through the alternative remedy, with the 
speed, expense or convenience of obtaining it under Article 199. 
But in making this comparison those factors must not be taken 
into account which would themselves alter if the remedy under 
Article 199 were used as a substitute for the other remedy. 
(iii) 
In practice, the following steps may be taken:- 
(a) 
Formulate the grievance in the given case, as a 
generalized category; 
(b) 
Formulate the relief that is necessary to redress that 
category of grievance; 
(c) 
See if the law has prescribed any remedy that can redress 
that category of grievance in that way and to the required 
extent; 
(d) 
If such a remedy is prescribed, the law contemplates that 
resort must be had to that remedy; 
(e) 
If it appears that the machinery established for the 
purposes of that remedy is not functioning properly, the 
correct step to take will be a step that is calculated to 
ensure, as far as lies in the power of the Court, that that 
machinery begins to function as it should. It would not be 
correct to take over the function of that machinery. If the 
function of another organ is taken over, that other organ 
will atrophy, and the organ that takes over will break 
down under strain; 
(f) 
If there is no other remedy that can redress that category 
of grievance in that way and to the required extent, or if 
there is such a remedy but conditions are attached to it 
which for a particular category of cases would neutralise 
or defeat it so as to deprive it of its substance, the Court 
should give the requisite relief under Article 199; 
(g) 
If there is such other remedy, but there is something so 
special in the circumstances of a given case that the other 
remedy which is generally adequate to the relief required 
for that category of grievance, is not adequate to the relief 
that is essential in the very special category to which that 
case belongs, the Court should give the required relief 
under Article 199. 
28. 
 
The question as to whether the other remedy(ies) constitutes 
an alternative remedy that would limit the jurisdiction of the High Court 
under Article 199 of the Constitution is one of law. It must be determined 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023

on an individual basis. Since the ATC decides about the applicability of 
section 7 of the ATA after taking cognizance, in certain instances, the 
remedy under section 23 of the ATA may not be adequate and efficacious, 
as explained above, to qualify as an alternative remedy. Therefore, we 
cannot lay down an inflexible rule that the High Court cannot consider 
whether section 7 of the ATA applies in a particular matter until the litigant 
has availed remedy under section 23 of the ATA. The High Court should 
decide each case after considering its peculiar facts and circumstances. 
29. 
 
The Impugned Order lists ten FIRs in which the police have 
applied section 7 of the ATA. The Inspector General of Police has apprised 
us that police have collected forensic materials from the crime scenes and 
vital information from geo-fencing, call records of different people, and 
other sources which are being analysed. According to him, prima facie, an 
act of terrorism as defined by law has been committed. In the 
circumstances, it is necessary to wait until the relevant reports are received 
before determining whether the police correctly applied section 7 of the 
ATA in the aforementioned cases. It may come out that they did it rightly 
in some but not in others, necessitating individual review of each case. Any 
opinion by this Court at this stage may be detrimental to the interests of 
justice. If so advised, the Petitioner or any aggrieved person may file 
separate proceedings later. 
Constitutionality of the JITs 
30. 
 
In general, JITs are established under an agreement between 
the competent authorities of two or more States to conduct criminal 
investigations in one or more of the involved States for a limited time and a 
defined purpose.8 “JITs have the following advantages over traditional 
forms of police and judicial cooperation: (a)  JITs enable the direct 
collection and exchange of information and evidence without using 
conventional channels of mutual legal assistance (MLA). Information and 
evidence gathered in conformity with the legislation of the State in which 
the team operates can be shared solely on the basis of the JIT agreement, 
and (b) Seconded members of the team (i.e. those coming from a State 
other than the one in which the JIT operates) have the right to be present

and participate in investigative measures conducted outside their State of 
origin. For these reasons, JITs are a highly efficient and effective 
cooperation mechanism which facilitates the coordination of investigations 
and prosecutions conducted in parallel across several States.”9 
31. 
 
In EU policy-making, the concept of a JIT first appeared in 
1994 when a German delegation submitted a discussion paper to the 
Customs Corporation Working Group during deliberations on revising and 
updating the 1967 Naples Convention on mutual assistance between 
customs authorities. Germany raised the idea again in the first draft of the 
Naples II Convention and then in a note on new methods of cross-border 
investigation during the preparation of the EU Mutual Legal Assistance 
Convention (the “EU MLA Convention”). In March 1999, the German 
Presidency advocated putting a concrete provision on joint investigation 
teams in the EU MLA Convention. JITs were debated not just in the 
technical working group dealing with the draft EU MLA Convention this 
time, but the concept was also incorporated in other important EU policy 
documents. JITs were first mentioned in the 1997 Action Plan to combat 
organized crime. The 1997 Amsterdam Treaty formally introduced in 
Article 30.2 a general provision that envisaged the involvement of Europol 
in (unspecified) “joint teams”. In 1998, Article 43.1.b. of the Vienna 
Action Plan elaborated on this provision and, in 1999, the Presidency 
Conclusions of the European Council in Tampere called for “joint 
investigation teams as foreseen in the Treaty to be set up without delay.”10 
According to Article 13 of the EU MLA Convention, a JIT is an 
“operational investigation team consisting of representatives of law 
enforcement and other authorities for different Member States and possibly 
from other organizations like Europol and Eurojust.” 
32. 
 
Article 13 of the 2000 EU MLA Convention and the 2002 
Framework Decision on JITs provide the EU legal foundation for 
establishing JITs between Member States, but they can also be set up under

other international instruments.11 Likewise, competent authorities from  
non-EU countries can organize JITs in accordance with the appropriate 
international agreements. 
33. 
 
Sometimes, a JIT is used domestically for coordination 
between various law enforcement agencies for a single investigation in a 
criminal case within a given timeframe. Long before she launched her EU 
initiatives, Germany employed the notion of JITs (Gemeinsame 
Ermittlungsgruppen) as a strategy for collaboration between law 
enforcement agencies in and between different Lander (states) of the 
German Federal Republic. She established its first JIT in Hamburg between 
state police and federal customs.12 
34. 
 
Pakistan adopted the concept of the JIT in section 19 of the 
ATA (see Appendix-II). Later, it was also incorporated in some other 
statutes, for instance, Article 18A of the Police Order, 2002,13 section 30 of 
the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, and section 9 of the Anti-
Rape (Investigation and Trial Act) 2021. The courts have also constituted 
JITs in certain matters.14 
                                          
11 The following instruments include a legal basis for setting up JITs: 
 
Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of 
Norway on the application of certain provisions of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual 
Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union and the 2001 
Protocol thereto;  
 
Article 5 of the Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance between the European Union and the 
United States of America;  
 
Article 27 of the Police Cooperation Convention for South-East Europe (PCC-SEE), applicable 
between several Member States (Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia) and countries 
of the Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYROM, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia);

Assistance;  
 
Article 9 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances; 
 
Article 19 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC); 
 
Article 49 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC); 


Section 94 Cr.P.C. grants wide powers to the Investigating 
Officer to compel the production of any document or other thing necessary 
or desirable for any investigation. However, Parliament found this 
provision inadequate to deal with cases involving terrorism which 
constitute a special class. Investigation in such cases may need to be 
conducted across provinces or internationally. This may require special 
skills or knowledge that regular police personnel lack. Sometimes, they 
may also require assistance from other agencies within the country and 
overseas. Since a fair investigation is essential to the right to a fair trial,  
JITs help it. Consequently, subject to statutory safeguards, the concept does 
not offend the Constitution. 
36. 
 
The Petitioners contend that section 19 of the ATA violates 
Article 10A of the Constitution (right to a fair trial) because it does not 
provide for a change of investigation from a JIT. We are afraid the 
contention is misconceived. We must first point out that nobody has a 
vested right to have the case investigated by a particular person or a body 
of persons. In Federation of Pakistan v. Shah Muhammad Khan and 
others (PLD 1960 SC 85), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held: 
“No law or regulation gives a complainant a vested right, which can be 
enforced by a writ to have his complaint investigated by a particular 
branch of the police, and the law gives powers to the Central 
Government by a general or special order to take away the jurisdiction 
and powers of investigation and arrest of the Special Police 
Establishment by the proviso to section 2 (2) of the Ordinance referred to 
above. The respondent No. 1, therefore, had no right to maintain a 
petition for writ, and the High Court was in error in issuing a direction 
on such a petition. The order of the High Court is, therefore, set aside, 
and this appeal is allowed.” 
37. 
 
In some early cases, the courts considered that transferring a 
case from one competent investigating agency to another amounted to 
“unwanted” interference with the investigation,15 which the Judicial 
Committee of the Privy Council disapproved of in Khwaja Nazir Ahmad.16 
That view subsequently changed, and the requests for change of 
investigation or re-investigation began to be considered on the 
administrative side under section 551 Cr.P.C. Now, Article 18A of the 
Police Order 2002 expressly deals with the subject. It provides a complete 
                                          
15 Shahnaz Begum v. The Hon’ble Judges of the High Court of Sind and Baluchistan and another  
(PLD 1971 SC 677) 
16 Emperor v Khwaja Nazir Ahmed (AIR 1945 PC 18).

statutory mechanism for change of investigation. There is neither any rule 
of law nor administrative practice which gives any person a vested right to 
have the investigation of a case transferred. 
38. 
 
It is incorrect that the ATA does not contain any provision for 
a change of investigation from a JIT.  Sections 19(1A) and 28(3) of the Act 
give the authority to the Federal Government. If a person has a genuine 
grievance, he may also make a representation before it. The maxim 
“everything which is not forbidden is allowed” applies here. The 
Government is obligated to decide on such representation within a 
reasonable time. 
Constitution of JIT under the ATA 
39. 
 
Section 19(1) of the ATA provides that if the Government 
deems it necessary, it may constitute a JIT led by an officer not below the 
rank of Superintendent of Police (BS-18). The other officers of the JIT may 
be of equivalent rank from intelligence agencies, armed forces and civil 
armed forces. The JIT shall comprise five members, and the quorum shall 
consist of these members for a meeting. The JIT may co-opt any additional 
member from any Federal or Provincial institution or department deemed 
appropriate for investigation. Section 19(1A) of the ATA states that the 
Federal Government may, in respect of any case registered by or under 
investigation with the police, or any other investigation agency or 
authority, by written order, entrust inquiry or such investigation to such 
agency or authority as it may deem fit. Thereupon, the police or any other 
investigation agency or authority shall transfer the case record to it. 
40. 
 
Section 2(i) of the ATA defines “Government” as follows: 
(i) 
“Government” means the Federal Government or, as the case 
may be, the Provincial Government. 
41. 
 
Considering the above definition, Section 19(1) of the ATA 
grants the Federal and Provincial Governments concurrent powers to form 
a JIT. Under section 19(1A), the Federal Government may transfer an 
inquiry or investigation from one agency to another. This is an additional 
power. 
42. 
 
The phrase “if the Government deems necessary” in section 
19(1) of the ATA is significant. “Deems it necessary” means to “consider 
someone or something essential, important or appropriate”. The phrase is 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023 
 
- 17 -
sometimes used interchangeably with “deems it fit”, but they are not 
synonymous. “Necessary” connotes more than desirable but less than 
indispensable or absolute necessity. Accordingly, the test is one of 
reasonable necessity and consideration of alternative measures for a 
particular action.17 On the other hand, “deems fit” implies that something 
may be done or not done as deemed fit at the person’s discretion. The two 
phrases share one feature: the authority must act justly, fairly and in 
conformity with the law. In the context of section 19(1) of the ATA, the 
expression “deems necessary” should be construed to mean a decision that 
is desirable or appropriate to achieve the objective of the Act and to foster 
the ends of justice. Terrorism has plagued our country for more than three 
decades. Therefore, the Government should be given as much investigative 
leeway as possible. Intelligence agencies are critical in gathering 
information on organized criminals and assisting law enforcement officials 
in busting such gangs. These crimes may entail an investigation into 
conduct that extends beyond the local area, necessitating the use of special 
skills and equipment that local police may not have. Hence, the phrase “if 
the Government deems necessary” should be interpreted broadly to allow 
for setting up JITs. Even otherwise, since the formation of JIT is a question 
relating to the conduct of the investigation and a purely administrative act, 
it is not subject to judicial review. The courts should only intervene when it 
is found that the Government’s action is mala fide or that there is a 
colourable exercise of authority. 
43. 
 
The violence between 22.2.2023 and 19.3.2023 damaged 
public and private property worth crores of rupees, injured many police 
personnel and killed at least one person. Allegedly, the PTI workers threw 
petrol bombs at the police as they attempted to execute non-bailable 
warrants issued by the Islamabad Sessions Court against Imran Khan. A 
thorough probe into these incidents is essential to bring the miscreants to 
justice. The Caretaker Cabinet has rightly constituted the JIT to broaden the 
investigation’s scope and make it transparent, fair, and credible. The 
Petitioners have failed to demonstrate that the Impugned Order is mala 
fide.

The procedure of the JITs 
44. 
 
The JITs constituted under section 19 of the ATA perform 
their functions in accordance with the ATA, the Code, the Police Rules, 
1934, and the Investigation for Fair Trial Act, 2013. These, however, are 
inadequate to regulate them. Section 35 of the ATA empowers the Federal 
Government and Provincial Governments to make rules for carrying out the 
purposes of the Act. So far, none of them has framed any to regulate the 
JITs, which is regrettable. The Advocate General brought to our notice the 
SOPs issued by the Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan,18 but they 
are too general to address the deficiencies.  
45. 
 
Every JIT under the ATA serves a specific purpose and has an 
object. The Government may also include officers from intelligence 
agencies, armed forces and civil armed forces. A comprehensive legal 
framework is required to regulate their appointments and functioning. This 
is essential for promoting the rule of law and making the system more 
credible and efficient. 
46. 
 
The Petitioners want us to suspend the formation of the JITs 
and their functioning until proper rules are framed. We are not inclined to 
do so. However, we direct the Federal Government to make them within 
two months from the date of the announcement of this judgment. The 
Registrar of this Court shall forthwith send its copy to the Secretary, 
Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan. 
The other objections to the Impugned Order 
47. 
 
The Petitioners’ next challenge to the Impugned Order is 
based on the case of M/s Mustafa Impex, Karachi, and others v. 
Government of Pakistan and others (PLD 2016 SC 808). They claim that 
it was issued without the Provincial Cabinet’s approval. In Mustafa Impex, 
the Supreme Court held that the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 
2010, has made fundamental changes in the Constitution which, inter alia, 
include channelling the Government’s executive power. The Supreme 
Court ruled that insofar as the Federal Government is concerned, it consists 
of the Prime Minister and the Federal Ministers (i.e. the Cabinet) but does 
not include the President because he is the Head of the State. Neither a

Secretary nor a Minister nor the Prime Minister constitutes the Federal 
Government and cannot perform functions on its behalf. The Supreme 
Court further held that the Rules of Business, 1973, are binding on the 
Federal Government and must be followed in letter and spirit in all 
circumstances. Rule 16 gives the Prime Minister discretionary power to 
bring matters before the Cabinet. However, the exercise of that discretion is 
subject to two conditions: first, he must consciously apply his mind to 
every case and justify through a reasoned and formal order where he 
believes that reference to the Cabinet is not necessary; and second, the 
matter should not be such regarding which Cabinet decision is mandatory 
under the Constitution. The same principles apply to the Provincial 
Government. 
48. 
 
The Provincial Governments conduct business according to 
Rules framed under Article 139 (3) of the Constitution. Under Rule 25 of 
the Punjab Government Rules of Business 2011, the cases referred to the 
Cabinet shall be disposed of: 
i) 
by discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet; 
ii) 
by circulation amongst the Ministers; and 
iii) 
by discussion at a meeting of a Committee of the Cabinet. 
49. 
 
Respondents No.1, 3, and 12 have submitted documents that 
reflect that the Caretaker Cabinet, in its 3rd Meeting held on 16.2.2023, 
approved the TORs of the Standing Committee on Law & Order  
(the “Standing Committee”). It further decided that because the decisions 
of the Standing Committee do not involve any financial implications, they 
need not be ratified as per Rule 25(2) of the Rules of Business. One of the 
TORs of the Standing Committee is to approve JITs under the ATA. The 
Standing Committee was notified on 11.3.2023. The Inspector General of 
Police, vide Letter No. SO(JUDL-III)-11-JITs/2023 dated 22.3.2023, 
requested the Home Department to constitute JIT in ten cases registered 
against the PTI workers. His request was placed before the Standing 
Committee in its 2nd Meeting held on 22.3.2023 and was accepted, and 
then the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) issued the Impugned Order. 
50. 
 
The Petitioners’ counsel, Mr Saleem, alleged that the language 
of the Impugned Order shows that the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) 
issued it on his own intention without the approval of the Caretaker Cabinet 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023 
 
- 20 -
or the Standing Committee and that the documents referred by Respondents 
No.1, 3, and 12 are fabricated/ante-dated. He focused on the words “in the 
exercise of powers conferred” mentioned in the Impugned Order. Although 
official records are presumed to be correct, the Advocate General showed 
us the minutes of all pertinent sessions of the Caretaker Cabinet and the 
Standing Committee. We are satisfied that the Impugned Order conforms 
to the dictate of Mustafa Impex. Any errors or ambiguities in its language 
are inconsequential. 
51. 
 
Finally, we come to the Petitioner’s objection relating to the 
composition of the JIT. They are upset with the inclusion of SSP Imran 
Kishwar and SP Aftab Phularwan in it. They contend that the JIT cannot 
conduct an impartial and independent probe because these officers are 
subordinates of the Inspector General of Police and the City Capital Police 
Officer, Lahore, whom the PTI accuses of the murder of Zille Shah. 
Admittedly, there is not even the slightest evidence of bias against SSP 
Imran Kishwar and SP Aftab Phularwan. Their nomination cannot be 
objected on the basis of apprehensions. 
Powers and functions of the Prosecutor General Punjab  
52. 
 
The Advocate General is the principal law officer of the 
Provincial Government and has a constitutional status. In contrast, the 
Prosecutor General has a limited role defined by the PCPS Act. The two 
offices do not overlap. They rather complement each other.  
53. 
 
The office of the Advocate General of a province is 
established by Article 140 of the Constitution. He is charged with the duty 
to advise the Provincial Government upon such legal matters and to 
perform such other duties of a legal character as may be referred or 
assigned to him. Besides, he performs various functions under different 
statutes.19 The Advocate General owes an independent obligation towards 
the courts under Order XXVII-A CPC. In Federation of Pakistan and 
others v. Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao and others (PLD 1992 SC 723), the 
Supreme Court explained the nature and extent of the duty of the Attorney 
General and Advocate General under Order XXVII-A CPC as follows: 
                                          
19 See, for example, Article 111 of the Constitution (Right to speak in Provincial Assembly), Legal 
Practitioners and Bar Council Act, 1973, Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, Punjab Mental Health 
Ordinance, 2001. 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023 
 
- 21 -
“Besides, under Rule 1 of Order XXVII-A CPC, he has to appear and 
advise and assist the court so that it could have expert constitutional and 
legal advice. Therefore, it is made incumbent upon court to hear him in a 
case in which a substantial question of constitutional law is involved, 
before determining such question. But, in such a case, a notice to him is 
not notice to the Federation and vice versa unless it is so provided by 
law. He has two capacities: (1) Where the Federal Government directs 
him to appear in a case, and carry out instructions, whatever may be, and 
(2) as advisor, under the Constitution or law to advise as to the 
interpretation of Constitution or law. In performing such duty, he is not 
supposed to act on the advice of the Federation. He has to honestly guide 
the Federal Government and the Federal Legislature on the questions of 
law. Similarly, he has to advise courts as to the interpretation of 
constitutional law pursuant to a notice under Order XXVII-A, Rule 1 
CPC. He cannot be said to have performed his duty honestly and duly if 
he does not give his frank opinion on such constitutional questions. 
Therefore, counsel representing parties may interpret a provision of 
Constitution or law in the best interest of their respective clients even if 
they are Federation of Pakistan or the Province, but as an Attorney-
General or as an Advocate General, when he gives advice to the Federal 
Government or speaks in the Parliament or a court, on a question of law, 
he is not supposed to keep the interest of his client, but advise the 
Federal Government, or Parliament or a court of law, as the case may be, 
to the best of his ability, independently and in accordance with the 
Constitution.” 
54. 
 
In Haider Automobiles Ltd. v. Pakistan (PLD 1967 Lahore 
882), this Court held: 
“Under rule 1, the Advocate General of the Province or the Attorney-
General of Pakistan has a right to intervene without impleading the 
Provincial or the Central Government as a party. Thereby, the 
Government does not become a party to the case. It is only under rule 2 
that the Government is to be added as a party, if necessary.” 
55. 
 
The Prosecutor General is the head of the Punjab Criminal 
Prosecution Service, which was established under the Punjab Criminal 
Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions and Powers) Act, 2006  
(the “PCPS Act”). He is appointed by the Punjab Government for three 
years (extendable for another two years)20 on such terms and conditions as 
it may determine.21 However, those terms shall not be varied during the 
initial or extended term of his office.22 According to Section 6(6) of the 
PCPS Act, the Prosecutor General has the right to representation and 
audience in all courts, including the High Court, the Federal Shariat Court, 
and the Supreme Court, on behalf of the Punjab Government. 
56. 
 
Chapter-III (sections 9 to 13) of the PCPS Act describes the 
powers and functions of the prosecutor. According to section 2(1)(l) of the 
                                          
20 Section 6(2).

Act, prosecutor means “the Prosecutor General, Additional Prosecutor 
General, Deputy Prosecutor General, District Public Prosecutor, Deputy 
District Public Prosecutor, Assistant District Public Prosecutor, and a 
Public Prosecutor appointed under this Act and shall be deemed to be the 
public prosecutor under the Code.” Section 5(1) of the PCPS Act states that 
the Punjab Government shall exercise superintendence over the 
Prosecution Service to achieve the Act’s objectives, while section 5(2) 
states that the Service’s administration shall, in the prescribed manner, vest 
in the Prosecutor General. It is pertinent to note that the PCPS Act 
distinguishes between “administration” and “superintendence”. Section 
2(2) of the Act of 2006 provides that the words and expressions used 
therein but not defined shall have the same meaning as are assigned to 
them in the Code or the Police Order 2002. Since the terms 
“administration” and “superintendence” are defined in Article 2(1) of the 
Police Order, we allude to them. The said Article says: 
(i) 
“Administration” 
includes 
management of administrative, 
operational and financial functions. 
(xxvi-a) “superintendence” means supervision of police by the appropriate 
Government through policy, oversight, and guidance, and in the case of a 
province, it shall be exercised by the Chief Minister through the Chief 
Secretary and the Provincial Home Department, while ensuring total 
autonomy of the Provincial Police Officer in operational, administrative 
and financial matter and, in case of Federal Capital, such supervision 
shall be exercised by Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan. 
57. 
 
Applying the above definitions, the role of the Punjab 
Government under the PCPS Act of 2006 is of policy-making and 
monitoring the Prosecution Service, while the Prosecutor General is 
charged with managing and controlling its administrative, operational, and 
financial functions. Since it is the fundamental obligation of the State to 
establish the rule of law and ensure justice for everyone within its borders, 
the Government must take necessary steps to attain that purpose. All its 
policies must be tailored to that end. The objective of the Prosecution 
Service – and the Prosecutor General – is also the same. 
58. 
 
There is no cavil that the Prosecution Service is an attached 
department of the Punjab Government and is under the administration and 
control of the Public Prosecution Department in terms of Serial No.32 of 
the First Schedule of the Rules of Business. However, it has a unique role. 
The Preamble of the PCPS Act states that its purpose was to establish an

independent, effective, and efficient Service for prosecuting criminal cases 
and to ensure prosecutorial independence for better coordination in the 
criminal justice system in the Punjab.

Mr Gul contends that the Prosecutor General must perform his 
functions according to the Government’s instructions. He argues that the 
expression “on behalf of Government” used in sections 6(6) and 9(1) of the 
PCPS Act are indicative of this legislative will and has cited the following 
passages in support of his contention: 
The State v. Gangamma (A-4) and others (AIR 1965 Karnataka 235) 
“10. 
The words, ‘on behalf of’ have been construed in several judicial 
decisions. In Bank of Bengal v. Fagan, 7 Moo PC 61, the Privy Council 
observed as follows: 
“… But it is said, that the power was given to do the acts in 
question on the donor’s behalf. This is really only saying that 
what the agent is to do, he is to do as representing the principal; 
as doing it on behalf of, or in the place and in the right of, the 
principal …” 
“13. 
Thus the words, ‘on behalf of’ connote an agency; when one 
person acts on behalf of the other the former acts as an agent of the latter. 
No doubt ordinarily, an agency, that is, the relationship of principal and 
agent, is the result of a contract express or implied; but an agency may 
also be created by a statute.” 
“16. 
As observed by Caspersz and Sharfuddin, JJ., in Uttam Chand v. 
Emperor, ILR 39 Cal 344, the expression ‘on behalf of’ connotes some 
benefit to the person on whose behalf another person may act. It cannot 
be said that after the death of the aggrieved wife, the filing of the 
complaint against her husband for the act of bigamy would be to her 
benefit. The prosecution of the guilty husband will not confer any benefit 
even to her estate. Hence the complaint filed by a relative of the wife 
after the death, cannot be said to be on her behalf.” 
Navaikulam Cashew Workers Industrial Cooperative Society Ltd. v. 
Enforcement Officer [2009 (83) AIC 515]. 
“8. 
The expression ‘on behalf of’ connotes some benefit to the 
person on whose behalf another person may act (See Uttam Chanel v. 
Emperor, 15 IC 1007). In State v. Gangamma, MANU/KA/0069/1965 : 
AIR 1965 Mys. 235, the expression ‘on behalf of’ was interpreted and it 
was held, thus the words, ‘on behalf of’ connote an agency; when one 
person act on behalf of the other, the former acts as the agent of the 
latter. No doubt, originally, an agency, i.e., the relationship of principal 
and agency is the result of a contract express or implied; but an agency 
may also be created by a statute.” 
60. 
 
There cannot be two opinions that the Prosecutor General 
must perform his functions according to the Government’s instructions. 
What we disagree with Mr Gul is that he must follow the Government’s 
wishes in prosecuting criminal cases. In our opinion, he must act 
independently in the interest of justice. We have reviewed the above 
judgments and noted that the courts’ interpreted the expression “on behalf 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023 
 
- 24 -
of Government” in the peculiar circumstances of the cases they were 
deciding. This interpretation cannot be applied to the PCPS Act because it 
contradicts its objective. 
61. 
 
Section 11(2) of the PCPS Act stipulates that the Prosecutor 
General shall liaison with the office of the Attorney General and the 
Advocate General on matters pending in the superior courts. According to 
Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary of Current English,  “liaison” 
means “a relationship between two organizations, involving the exchange 
of information or ideas.”23 Hence, section 11(2) cannot be read to imply 
that the Prosecutor General reports to the Advocate General. Both are 
separate offices with distinct functions. However, as adumbrated, the 
Advocate General holds a constitutional position with broader 
responsibilities. 
62. 
 
Section 17 of the PCPS Act states that the Prosecutor General 
shall issue a code of conduct for the prosecutors (the “Code of Conduct”) 
with the prior approval of the Punjab Government. We have been apprised 
that the First Edition of the Code of Conduct was issued in 2012, and the 
Second in October 2016. Both were approved by the Ministry’s Secretary 
rather than the Provincial Cabinet. The legality of the Second Edition may 
be questioned on the basis of the Mustafa Impex case, but the First Edition 
still holds the field. In Pakistan Medical and Dental Council v. 
Muhammad Fahad Malik and others (2018 SCMR 1956), the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan stated that the judgment in Mustafa Impex would apply 
prospectively.  
63. 
 
The Code of Conduct generally refers to prosecutors but 
applies equally to the Prosecutor General. Paragraph 3 sets out the General 
Principles of Prosecution. The following three are relevant to the present 
discourse: 
3.1 
The decision to prosecute is a serious step that affects suspects, 
victims, witnesses and the public at large and must be taken with 
the utmost care and caution. 
3.2 
Prosecutors must always act in the interests of justice and not 
solely for the purpose of obtaining a conviction. Acting in the 
interest of justice means that Prosecutors must acquaint 
themselves with the facts and circumstances of the case and work 
to ensure that the right person is prosecuted for the right offence 
and no one else. 
                                          
23 Tenth Edition, p.903 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023 
 
- 25 -
3.3 
Prosecutors must also ensure that the law is properly applied; the 
relevant evidence is put before the court; and that obligations of 
disclosure are met. Prosecutors must also consider whether trial is 
the best solution. 
64. 
 
In our opinion, the Government cannot also deviate from the 
above principles, and they must be hardwired into all its policies. 
65. 
 
Paragraph 2.2 of the Code of Conduct stipulates that the 
prosecutors cannot direct the police or other investigators except as 
provided by paragraph 4. According to paragraph 4.1, a decision to 
prosecute is taken when a prosecutor determines that the case is fit for trial 
against one or more suspects. A decision to start a prosecution is the same 
as a decision to prosecute. Paragraph 4.2 states that a decision not to 
prosecute is made when a prosecutor determines that a case is unfit for trial 
against one or more suspects. A decision to decline a prosecution is 
equivalent to the decision not to prosecute. Paragraph 4.8 says that a 
decision on whether or not to prosecute must be taken when a review of the 
police case has been finalized. Paragraph 4.12 provides that prosecutors 
may make a decision only if they are satisfied that the broad extent of the 
criminality has been determined and they can make a fully informed 
evaluation. If the prosecutors do not have enough information to take such 
a decision, the investigation must be continued, and a decision should be 
made later in accordance with the Full Code Test described in paragraph 5. 
It comprises two tests, the Evidential Test and the Public Interest Test, 
which are applied sequentially. These tests are explained in paragraphs 5A 
and 5B of the Code of Conduct. 
66. 
 
A prosecutor may apply the Threshold Test24 where all the 
evidence is unavailable, and a decision must be made regarding the 
detention or start of a prosecution. It is, however, pertinent to point out that 
this test is directory and not mandatory, which is indicated by the word 
“may” in paragraph 6.1 of the Code of Conduct. Further, it is contingent on 
the availability of some, if not all, of the evidence. The evidential 
consideration of the Threshold Test has two parts: the first is that the 
prosecutor must be satisfied that there are at least reasonable grounds to 
believe that the person to be charged committed the offence. This 
satisfaction occurs only after evaluating the evidence and ensuring it is 
                                          
24 See paragraph 6 of the Code of Conduct 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023 
 
- 26 -
relevant and admissible. This exercise is dependent on the elements listed 
in the second part. The prosecutor must be convinced that there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that the ongoing investigation will yield 
more evidence within a reasonable time so that all the evidence combined 
can establish a realistic prospect of conviction under the Full Code Test. 
The additional evidence must be identifiable and not speculative. Paragraph 
6.4 of the Code of Conduct states that the Threshold Test should not be 
employed when the evidence on which the criminality of the suspect hinges 
is in the process of forensic analysis. 
67. 
 
Terrorism cases are extremely complicated. When police 
produce the accused before the court for the first time after his arrest  
(which is within 24 hours), very little evidence is available. At that point, 
using the Threshold Test is difficult, if not impossible. Hence, it is 
desirable to apply it at a later stage, such as when filing an interim report 
under section 173 Cr.P.C. However, this observation should not be 
construed as limiting the court’s powers to grant or refuse a remand or bail 
to an accused or to discharge him. 
68. 
 
Paragraph 7 of the Code of Conduct gives certain guidelines to 
the prosecutors for the selection of charges.25 However, the trial court is 
neither bound by the opinion of the police nor the prosecutor regarding the 
applicability of a penal provision. In Munir Aftab v. The State and others 
(2021 PCr.LJ 293), this Court held: 
“12. 
A criminal case that commences with the registration of FIR 
under section 154, Cr.P.C. has a long journey before it is decided and 
the accused is/are acquitted or convicted. FIR sets the law in motion. 
The police investigate the allegations of the complainant party, collect 
evidence, identify the offences committed by the accused and 
determine what penal provisions are attracted. After that, they draw a 
report under section 173 Cr.P.C. which is submitted to the court 
through the office of the District Public Prosecutor. Section 9(5) of 
the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions and 
Powers) Act, 2006 (III of 2006) obligates the public prosecutor to 
scrutinize the said report and submit it to the court if it is in order. 
However, if it is defective, he shall return the same to the officer-in-
charge of the police station or the investigating officer (as the case 
                                          
25 Paragraph 7.1 of the Code of Conduct reads as follows: 
7.1 
Prosecutors should select the charges which: 
a) 
reflect the seriousness and extent of the offending supported by the evidence; 
b) 
give the court adequate powers to sentence and impose appropriate post-
conviction orders; 
c) 
enable the case to be presented in a clear and simple way. This means that 
prosecutors may not always choose or continue with the most serious charge. 

Writ Petition No. 24153/2023

may be) for correction. The term "scrutinize" has a wide connotation 
and includes the power to add or delete a section. Reliance is placed 
on Rasoolan Bibi v. Additional Sessions Judge and others (PLD 2009 
Lahore 135) and Nadeem alias Deema v. District Public Prosecutor, 
Sialkot and 7 others (2012 PCr.LJ 1823). 
“13. 
The trial court is neither bound by the opinion of the police nor 
the prosecutor regarding the applicability of a penal provision. At the 
time of indicting the accused, it is bound to go through the entire 
record, apply its own judicial mind and frame charge against him for 
all those offences which appear to be made out from the evidence 
collected by the police. Section 9(7) requires the prosecutor to assist 
the court in this matter. However, under section 227 Cr.P.C. the court 
is competent to amend the charge at any time before judgment is 
pronounced. 
“14. 
It may not be out of place to mention that the High Court does 
not entertain constitutional petitions challenging the insertion or 
deletion of a section by the Investigating Officer. Similarly, it does 
not allow requests for judicial review of the opinion/direction of the 
public prosecutor given to the police for such an amendment on the 
ground that the error, if any, does not prejudice either party and it can 
be rectified by the trial court at the time of framing of charge.” 
69. 
 
We have considered Fayyaz Ahmed and another v. The State 
and others (2008 PCr.LJ 805), a case decided by a Division Bench of this 
Court, which holds that a prosecutor has no authority to delete (or add) an 
offence in the report under section 173 Cr.P.C. prepared by the police. We 
respectfully disagree with this but clarify that his opinion does not bind the 
court and that it is the final arbiter whether a particular provision applies.  
70. 
 
Admittedly, the investigation in the cases mentioned in the 
Impugned Order is at the initial stage or is yet to begin. It is still to be 
determined whether there was any “design” or “purpose” behind the 
incidents that occurred between 22.2.2023 and 19.3.2023, which may 
constitute terrorism under section 6 of the ATA. The Threshold Test is 
subject to certain conditions explained above. The Code of Conduct 
expressly prohibits the prosecutor from applying it in cases where 
criminality depends on forensic analysis of evidence. As adumbrated, such 
a process is currently underway in the subject cases. As a result, Ch. 
Khaliq-uz-Zaman’s opinion regarding the non-applicability of section 7 
ATA to them is premature.  
71. 
 
We cannot comment on the Cabinet’s decision dated 
20.4.2023 and the Punjab Government’s subsequent restraint order against 
Ch. Khaliq-uz-Zaman because it is not under challenge in the present 
proceedings.

Conclusion 
72. 
 
The Impugned Order is unexceptionable. The Government is 
competent to form the JIT in the cases mentioned therein. These petitions 
are dismissed.

willful disobedience of the orders of the Anti-Terrorism Court and the person 
committing the default shall be liable to be punished for contempt of Court. 
(3)

Where, in a case triable by an Anti-Terrorism Court, an accused has been 
released from police custody or custody of any other investigating agency joined in an 
investigation, under section 169 of the Code, or has been remanded to judicial custody, 
the Anti-Terrorism Court may, on good grounds being shown by a Public Prosecutor or

brought to the notice of the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned for appropriate 
directions, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case. 
(8) 
An Anti-Terrorism Court shall not give more than two adjournments during the 
trial of the case and that also imposition of exemplary costs. If the defense counsel does 
not appear after two consecutive adjournments, the court may appoint a State Counsel 
with at least seven years standing in criminal matters for the defense of the accused 
from the panel of advocates maintained by the court for the purpose in consultation with 
the Government and shall proceed with the trial of the case. 
(8a) 
Non-compliance with the provisions of sub-section (7) or (8) may render the 
presiding officer of the court liable to disciplinary action by the concerned High Court. 
(8b) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in section 7 of the Explosive Substances 
Act. 1908 (VI of 1908), or any other law for the time being in force, if the consent or 
sanction of the appropriate authority, where required, is not received within thirty days 
of the submission of challan in the court, the same shall be deemed to have been given 
or accorded and the court shall proceed with the trial of the case. 
(9) 
An Anti-Terrorism Court shall not, merely by reason of a change in its 
composition or transfer of a case under sub-section (3) of section 12, be bound to recall 
and re-hear any witness who has given evidence and may act on the evidence already 
recorded. 
(10) 
Any accused person may be tried in his absence if the Anti-Terrorism Court, 
after such inquiry as it deems fit, is satisfied that such absence is deliberate and brought 
about with a view to impeding the course of justice: 
Provided that the accused person shall not be tried under this sub-section unless 
a proclamation has been published in respect of him in at least in one daily newspaper 
including Sindhi language requiring him to appear at a specified place within seven

Provided further that the Court shall proceed with the trial after taking the 
necessary steps to appoint an Advocate at the expense of the State to defend the accused 
person who is not before the court. 
Explanation. An accused who is tried in his absence under this sub-section shall 
be deemed not to have admitted the commission of any offence for which he has been 
charged. 
(11) 
The Advocate appointed under the second proviso to sub-section (10) shall be a 
person selected by the Anti-Terrorism Court for the purpose and he shall be engaged at 
the expense of the Government. 
(11A) Noting contained in sub-section (10) or sub-section (11) shall be construed to 
deny the accused the right to consult or be defended by a legal practitioner of his own 
choice. 
(12) 
If, within sixty days from the date of his conviction, any person tried under sub-
section (10) appears voluntarily, or is apprehended and brought before the Anti-
Terrorism Court, and proves to its satisfaction that he did not abscond or conceal 
himself for the purpose of avoiding the proceeding against him, the Anti-Terrorism 
Court, shall set aside his conviction and proceed to try him in accordance with law for 
the offence with which he is charged: 
Provided that the Anti-Terrorism Court may exercise its powers under this sub-
section in a case in which a person as aforesaid appears before it after the expiration of 
the said period and satisfies it that he could not appear within the said period by reason 
of circumstances beyond his control. 
(13)

purpose of trial of any offence have all the powers of a Court of Sessions and shall try 
such offence as if it were a Court of Sessions as far as may be in accordance with the 
procedure prescribed in the Code for trial before a Court of Sessions.
