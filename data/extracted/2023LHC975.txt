Date of Hearing: 
01.03.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Ms. Mehreen Akbar Monga, 
Advocate.  
Respondent No.3 by: 
Mr. Zulfiqar Ahmed, Advocate.   
Anwaar Hussain, J.   Through this petition, under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner 
has assailed judgment dated 03.03.2020 passed by the learned Appellate 
Court below (“the impugned judgment”) whereby the appeal of 
respondent No.3 (“the respondent”), against ex-parte judgment and 
decree dated 16.01.2019, passed by the learned Trial Court in favour of 
the petitioner, was accepted and the case was remanded for decision 
afresh.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner states that after passing of ex-
parte judgment and decree dated 16.01.2019 by the learned Trial Court, 
the execution petition was filed in which the respondent was arrested and  
produced before the learned Executing Court on 24.04.2019, wherein the 
respondent got recorded his statement and undertook that he was willing 
to return the dowry articles belonging to the petitioner, hence, the 
respondent was estopped to lay challenge to the said ex-parte judgment 
and the appeal was not maintainable. Further contends that in order to 
secure the release of the respondent, his father stood surety. Adds that 
the conduct of the respondent debars him from seeking any relief 
inasmuch as when the learned Executing Court appointed a bailiff for 
implementing the process of return of the dowry articles, resistance with 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No.16930/2020

force was shown by father as well as other family members/friends of 
the respondent and dowry articles could not be lifted. On 03.05.2019, the 
bailiff submitted report with the request that the learned Executing Court 
may direct police for provision of assistance for implementation of order 
dated 24.04.2019 as the respondent had disappeared from the house and 
his father and brothers present there had locked the main door. In the 
meanwhile, the appeal was preferred by the respondent on 04.05.2019. 
Avers that without disclosing the said facts, the respondent preferred the 
said appeal against ex-parte judgment and decree dated 16.01.2019, 
which has been allowed vide impugned judgment dated 03.03.2020. 
Contends that the appeal was barred by 98 days and there was no 
sufficient reason given by the respondent explaining the delay in the 
application filed by respondent under Rule 22 of the Family Court Rules, 
1965. Places reliance on “Mst. Nadira Shahzad v. Mubashir Ahmad and 
others” (1995 SCMR 1419) in support of her contentions.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent submits that 
constitutional petition against a remand order is not maintainable. Adds 
that the learned Appellate Court below has rightly remanded the matter 
to the learned Trial Court as sufficient opportunity was not provided to 
the respondent for production of evidence. Further contends that the law 
favours adjudication on merit and not on technicalities and this fact has 
been rightly appreciated by the learned Appellate Court below. When 
confronted whether the issue of limitation was dealt with by the learned 
Appellate Court below, submits that since the appeal was admitted for 
regular hearing, vide order dated 04.05.2019, the learned Appellate 
Court below while passing the final judgment considered it irrelevant to 
examine question of limitation. Further states that the entire proceedings 
before the learned Trial Court including the passing of ex-parte 
judgment and decree were without appreciating the evidence and hence, 
the same were void. Concludes that the documentary evidence was 
tendered by the petitioner side in the statement of lawyer and hence, 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No.16930/2020 
 
 
 
3
could not be taken into account for rendering a decision. Places reliance 
on cases reported as “Fateh Sher v. Sarfraz and others” (1986 SCMR 
1356), “Mst. Salim-un-Nisa and 5 other v. Aziz and another” [2009 
CLC 860 (Peshawar)], Amir Shahzad v. Additional District Judge, 
Multan and 2 others” [2015 CLC 632 (Lahore)] and Mst. Akhtar 
Sultana v. Major Retd. Muzaffar Khan Malik through his legal heirs and 
others” (PLD 2021 SC 715) in support of his contentions.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
 
5. 
The facts of the case call upon this Court to render its opinion on 
the following questions: 
i. 
Whether the impugned judgment of the learned Appellate Court 
below suffers from legal infirmity of a nature which is amenable 
to the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court?  
ii. 
Whether the appeal of the respondent was maintainable given the 
delay in filing the said appeal? If so, whether it was justified under 
the law to remand the matter to the Trial Court for decision 
afresh?  
6. 
Admittedly, after institution of the suit by the petitioner on 
08.11.2014, the respondent submitted his written statement along with 
list of witnesses on 24.01.2015 when pre-trial reconciliation proceedings 
were conducted but the same failed. After framing of the issues, the case 
was fixed for evidence of the petitioner, which was completed on 
03.04.2017 whereafter the case was fixed for evidence of the respondent 
for 12.04.2017, however, after seeking number of adjournments, the 
respondent introduced new witnesses and tendered their affidavits in 
evidence. The respondent failed to produce his witnesses for cross-
examination despite availing number of opportunities over a period of 
about 01 year and 06 months and hence, his right to produce evidence 
was struck off, vide order dated 05.11.2018, and affidavits/evidence of 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No.16930/2020 
 
 
 
4
the new witnesses was discarded. It is also admitted feature of the case 
that the respondent never showed up thereafter and on 16.01.2019, the 
suit was finally decreed. Furthermore, neither any application nor appeal 
for setting aside the ex-parte proceedings or ex-parte judgment was filed 
by the respondent within time stipulated under the law and, hence, the 
same was time barred. Moreover, when the execution petition was filed 
by the petitioner on 05.03.2019, the respondent was arrested and 
presented before the learned Executing Court on 24.04.2019, he made 
the following statement:  
“Today, the captioned execution petition was fixed for 
production of judgment debtor through arrest. Judgment 
debtor has been produced by court bailiff. At this stage, 
judgment debtor showed his willingness to return all 
decreed dowry articles. Hence, on request and in the 
interest of justice, the Court bailiff is hereby appointed for 
recovery of dowry articles and is directed to submit his 
report on 08.05.2019. At this stage, learned counsel on 
behalf of judgment debtor has prayed for his release.  
2. 
Hence, in the interest of justice, judgment debtor is 
hereby released subject to furnishing surety to the tune of 
decretal amount….”  
(Emphasis provided) 
Subsequently, the learned Executing Court appointed a bailiff for 
implementing the process of returning the dowry articles and on 
03.05.2019, the bailiff submitted report before the learned Executing 
Court with the request for provision of police assistance for 
implementation of the order as the respondent had disappeared from the 
house and his father and brothers present there had locked the main door 
of the house. These facts, when confronted, could not be denied by 
learned counsel for the respondent. At this point, suffice to observe that 
this Court while exercising constitutional jurisdiction always considers 
the conduct of the parties as critically relevant factor and the conduct of 
the respondent cannot be considered appropriate in the instant case. The 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No.16930/2020 
 
 
 
5
above quoted statement of the respondent, dated 24.04.2019, was 
sufficient to put the matter to an end, however, instead of honouring his 
undertaking given before the learned Executing Court on said date, he 
preferred appeal against judgment and decree dated 16.01.2019 that was 
prima facie time barred. The respondent filed application, along with the 
appeal, for condonation of delay on the grounds that his father suffered 
arthritis attack and other diseases and that his counsel committed 
professional misconduct as the latter neither intimated the respondent 
about the proceedings nor attended his telephone call. As per contents of 
the said application, medical certificate showing illness of father of the 
respondent was appended with the said application along with 
application for initiation of proceedings by the respondent against his 
counsel, before Bar Council concerned, for alleged misconduct of the 
latter but the impugned judgment passed by the learned Appellate Court 
below is non speaking as no discussion has been made by the learned 
Appellate Court below in this regard for condoning delay. When 
confronted with, learned counsel for the respondent submits that when 
the appeal was admitted for regular hearing on 04.05.2019, issue of 
limitation was settled and hence, the learned Appellate Court below has 
rightly considered the issue of limitation as redundant. The said 
argument is also misconceived inasmuch as perusal of order dated 
04.05.2019 reveals that only preliminary arguments were heard on 
04.05.2019 when the petitioner was not in attendance and the appeal was 
admitted, without discussing the issue of limitation let alone its 
adjudication and decision in accordance with law. Relevant portion of 
order dated 04.05.2019 is reproduced below:  
“Instant appeal has been filed against impugned judgment 
and decree dated 16.01.2019 passed by Learned Judge 
Family Court, Lahore. An application for suspension of 
operation of impugned judgment and decree and alongwith 
affidavit has also been filed.

2. 
Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that 
impugned judgment and decree has been passed against law 
and facts without the application of legal principles on the 
subject matter.  
3. 
Points raised by the appellant needs consideration; 
hence, instant appeal is admitted for regular hearing. 
Meanwhile, operation of an impugned judgment and decree 
dated 16.01.2019 is hereby suspended till next date of 
hearing i.e. 24.05.2019.  
4. 
Let notice in name of the respondent be issued for 
24.05.2019 through ordinary process, registered post AD 
and courier service, subject to deposit of process fee within 
three days alongwith registered envelop AD card.”  
 
7. 
It is now well-settled principle of law that the law of limitation is 
not a mere technicality, rather it is to be observed and applied in its strict 
sense. If there is any delay in filing the appeal, each and every day is to 
be explained for its condonation. Furthermore, filing appeal by the 
respondent beyond the period of limitation created certain rights in 
favour of the petitioner more particularly when the respondent recorded 
a statement before the learned Executing Court, which could not be 
readily brushed aside unless some sound reason is available to condone 
the delay and ignore the statement recorded during the course of judicial 
proceedings, which is conspicuously missing in this case. Though stance 
of the respondent is belied by the very perusal of order dated 04.05.2019 
reproduced above, the argument that the admission of the appeal 
conclusively settled the issue of limitation even otherwise cannot hold 
water as mere issuance of notice on admission of appeal does not 
conclusively decides the said issue. It is pertinent to observe that right of 
the petitioner had accrued on account of appeal having become barred by 
time and the same could not have been taken away without hearing the 
petitioner.  
8. 
As far as question of maintainability of the present petition against 
a remand order is concerned, needless to mention that the facts of the 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No.16930/2020 
 
 
 
7
instant case are distinguishable from the facts of the cases relied upon by 
learned counsel for the respondent, more particularly, the fact that the 
respondent himself recorded statement before the learned Executing 
Court for returning the dowry articles and then concealed this fact from 
the learned Appellate Court below and this aspect has also not been dealt 
with. The cases relied upon by learned counsel for the respondent are 
settled elucidation of law on the subject but the same are not relevant in 
peculiar and distinguishable facts of the instant case. As far as objection 
that the documentary evidence was brought on record by the 
petitioner/plaintiff in the statement of the lawyer and its effect on the 
case, more particularly in family matters is concerned, the same can 
always be examined by the learned Appellate Court below while 
deciding the issue of limitation, effect of statement of the respondent 
before the learned Executing Court and the concealment thereof while 
preferring the appeal.  
9.  
The above discussion propels to conclude that the appeal of the 
respondent was time barred and, without addressing the question of 
limitation through cogent reasons so as the effect of statement of the 
respondent before learned Executing Court, remanding the matter to the 
learned Trial Court, is an error apparent on the face of record. 
Constitutional petition against such remand order is maintainable and 
merits interference by this Court in its supervisory jurisdiction.  
10. 
In the light of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion 
that the learned Appellate Court below has not adjudicated the 
matter/appeal in accordance with law. Therefore, this constitutional 
petition is allowed and the impugned judgment is set aside. As a natural 
corollary, the appeal of the respondent shall be deemed to be pending 
before the learned Appellate Court below. Parties are directed to appear 
on 18.03.2023 before the learned District Judge, Lahore who shall hear 
the appeal of the respondent himself or entrust it to a court of competent 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No.16930/2020 
 
 
 
8
jurisdiction. The Court so seized with the case, while deciding the merits 
of appeal of the respondent, shall also address the question of limitation 
as well as the effect of recording of statement by the respondent before 
the learned Executing Court that he will return the dowry articles to the 
petitioner. It is expected that the matter is concluded, strictly in 
accordance with law, within one month commencing from the said date.
