on 11.11.2015 at about 08:30 p.m. (night), she received information through 
phone that on 11.11.2015 at about 08:15 p.m. (night), her husband namely 
Umair alias Khalshi along with his brother namely Hafiz Umar and Shafique 
son of Muhammad Siddiq were going back to their home after taking tea from 
tea shop opposite to Rasheeda Khanam Hospital, Matta Virkan Road, 
Nowshera Virkan; 1) Abu Bakar alias Samosa (2) Master Ansar armed with 
pistol .30 bore on foot whereas Jamshed and (2) Javed armed with pistol .30 
bore along with one unknown while riding on motorcycle HONDA CD-70/ 
APL, being driven by unknown, came from Matta Virkan Road; immediately 
after arrival, Jamshed and Javed made straight firing from their weapon upon 
husband of the complainant due to which, two fires hit at front of chest of her 
husband;  thereafter, Abu Bakar and Ansar made straight firing upon husband 
of the complainant, due to which, two fires hit in the belly of her husband and 
one fire hit at his left hand in result whereof, husband of the complainant after 
becoming severe injured, fell down; accused persons while making firing fled 
away; husband of the complainant was immediately taken to Civil Hospital, 
Nowshera Virkan by Hafiz Umar and Shafique from where he was referred by 
the doctor to District Headquarter Hospital (DHQ), Gujranwala and after              
1½ hour of reaching there, during medical treatment, Umair (husband of the 
complainant) died. It has further been alleged in aforementioned application 
that after bringing dead body of the deceased from D.H.Q. Hospital, 
Gujranwala, same is lying in the mortuary of Civil Hospital, Nowshera Virkan 
and complainant after leaving Umar s/o Shafique for guarding the dead body, 
came to the police station; occurrence was witnessed by Hafiz Umar and 
Shafique.  
 
Motive behind the occurrence as per aforementioned application 
(Ex.PA) for registration of case was that Muhammad Umair (husband of the 
deceased) was an eyewitness of case arising out of F.I.R. No.637/2012, 
registered under Section: 302 PPC at Police Station: Nowshera Virkan, due to 
which, this occurrence took place on the abetment and consultation of Mian 
Nasir and Bismillah Begum.   
  
On the basis of aforementioned application (Ex.PA), case was 
registered vide F.I.R. No.632/2015 (Ex.PH/1) on 12.11.2015 under Sections: 
302, 109, 148, 149 PPC at Police Station: Nowshera Virkan. However, being 
dissatisfied with the conduct of the police as well as declaring some accused

persons as innocent in the case, Shazia Siddique (complainant/PW-1) filed 
“complaint” (Ex.PB) against Abu Bakar alias Samosa, Master Ansar, 
Jamshed, Javed, Mian Nasir, Mst. Bismillah and one unknown under 
Sections: 302, 109, 148, 149, 109 PPC alleging therein the same facts as 
mentioned in aforementioned F.I.R. (detailed above).  
 
  Abu Bakar alias Samosa, Master Ansar, Jamshed and Javed 
(appellants) along with their co-accused persons namely Mian Nasir and 
Bismillah Begum {mentioned in the complaint (Ex.PB)}, were summoned 
and formally charge sheeted to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed 
trial; prosecution produced ten witnesses to prove the charge against the 
accused persons whereas four witnesses were examined by the trial court as 
Court Witnesses; ocular account was furnished by Shazia Siddiq 
(complainant/PW-1), Hafiz Muhammad Umar Wakeel (PW-2) and 
Muhammad Shafiq (PW-3), medical evidence was furnished by Dr. Ghulam 
Sarwar Cheema (PW-8) whereas Investigating Officers namely Nisar Ahmad 
S.I. (CW-1), Farrukh Tufail S.I. (CW-2) and Adnan Shahzad S.I. (CW-3) 
deposed about investigation of the case. Thereafter statements of the 
appellants and their co-accused persons were recorded under Section: 342 
Cr.P.C. in which they refuted the allegations levelled against them; they did 
not opt to appear as their own witnesses under Section: 340(2) Cr.P.C., 
however, only Mian Nasir (since acquitted) produced some documentary 
evidence in his defence.  
Trial Court after conclusion of trial while acquitting co-accused persons 
namely Mian Nasir and Bismillah Begum has convicted and sentenced the 
appellants as mentioned above through impugned judgment dated: 19.04.2018. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the appellants have jointly submitted that 
convictions recorded and sentences awarded to the appellants through the 
impugned judgment are against the ‘law and facts’ of the case; ocular account 
is neither trustworthy nor corroborated by any other independent evidence; 
prosecution has remained unable to prove its case. Learned counsel for the 
appellants finally prayed for acquittal of the appellants. 
5. 
Learned Additional Prosecutor General has supported the impugned 
judgment to the extent of convictions recorded against and sentences awarded 
to the appellants and prayed for dismissal of their appeals.

6.  
Learned counsel for the complainant while supporting conviction and 
sentence recorded against Abu Bakar alias Samosa (appellant) and supporting 
conviction recorded against Master Ansar, Jamshed and Javed (appellants) 
prayed for dismissal of appeals filed by the convicts; he while supporting 
criminal revision prayed for enhancement of sentences of Master Ansar, 
Jamshed and Javed (respondents); whereas he in support of P.S.L.A. filed 
against order of acquittal of Mian Nasir and Mst. Bismillah Begum submitted 
that said acquittal is against the law and facts as well as result of misreading 
and non-reading of evidence; complainant has proved his case against them 
too up to hilt. Lastly prayed for setting aside the order of the acquittal as well 
as convicting and awarding punishment to the acquitted accused persons in 
accordance with law. 
7. 
Arguments heard.  Record perused. 
8.   
As per case of prosecution, occurrence took place at about 08:15 p.m.               
on 11.11.2015; Umair alias Khalshi (now deceased of the case) was shifted in 
injured condition to Civil Hospital, Nowshera Virkan, from there he was 
referred by the doctor to District Headquarter Hospital, Gujranwala where he 
died during treatment after 1½ hours; death of Umair alias Khalshi occurred 
during treatment, dead body was brought from there and kept in dead house of 
Civil Hospital, Nowshera Virkan and while leaving Umar for guarding dead 
body, complainant lady (Shazia Siddiq/PW-1) came to police station at 07:00 
a.m., submitted application (Ex.PA) for registration of case and resultantly 
F.I.R. (Ex.PH/1) was recorded. Though after the occurrence, first preference 
is to shift the injured to hospital for medical treatment and then to get 
registered the case, and time consumed in shifting of injured justifies delay in 
reporting the occurrence to the police yet it has to be proved by the 
prosecution that complainant/witnesses carried deceased in injured condition 
to hospital and time/period which was consumed for bringing him to hospital 
as well as in his medical treatment, and if actual time spent for said purpose 
tallies with the period of delay in reporting matter to police, then said delay is 
termed as “explained delay” and cannot be considered as fatal for prosecution. 
Therefore, in this case, prosecution was bound to prove that deceased was 
shifted in injured condition to hospital by cited eyewitnesses and he died 
during medical treatment. However, any entry of register of Civil Hospital, 
Nowshera Virkan regarding arrival of Umair alias Khalshi (now deceased of 

Criminal Appeal No.228667-J/2018, 
Criminal Appeal No.213552/2018,

the case) in injured condition there, any record of provision of any medical 
treatment to him there, copy of his medico legal examination certificate issued 
by Civil Hospital, Nowshera Virkan, copy or record of his referral slip from 
there to District Headquarter Hospital, Gujranwala, copy or record of any 
entry showing his arrival there in District Headquarter Hospital, Gujranwala, 
copy of his medical treatment chart or any record showing detail of his 
medical treatment there, copy of his death certificate issued from District 
Headquarter Hospital, Gujranwala or any other document issued by said 
hospital to show that he expired during medical treatment there and any 
document to show that when i.e. at what time, he expired, have not been 
produced by the prosecution. So much so any doctor who provided medical 
treatment to Umair alias Khalshi (now deceased of the case) in Civil Hospital, 
Nowshera Virkan and referred him to District Headquarter Hospital, 
Gujranwala, has not been produced to prove the same; similarly, doctor who 
medically treated him in District Headquarter Hospital, Gujranwala and under 
whose treatment, he died, have also not been produced. Furthermore, any 
document issued by afore-mentioned hospital to show that when i.e. at what 
time Umair alias Khalshi was brought in injured condition in Civil Hospital, 
Nowshera Virkan, when i.e. at what time he was received in District 
Headquarter Hospital, Gujranwala, at what time his dead body was handed 
over from District Headquarter Hospital, Gujranwala and when received in 
dead house of Civil Hospital, Nowshera Virkan, has also not been produced. 
So, afore-stated claim of the prosecution that deceased of the case was firstly 
taken to Civil Hospital, Nowshera Virkan in injured condition, then to District 
Headquarter Hospital, Gujranwala where he remained under medical 
treatment and then died after 1½ hours of arrival in said hospital, could not be 
proved. Hence, prosecution could not prove reason for delay in reporting the 
matter to police. Thus, there is unexplained and considerable delay of about 
10-hours and 45 minutes in registration of the case. It is well settled that when 
there is delay in reporting the incident to the police, then prosecution is under 
obligation to explain such delay and failure to do that will badly reflect upon 
the credibility of prosecution version. In this regard, guidance has been sought 
from the case of “Mst. ASIA BIBI versus The STATE and others” (PLD 
2019 Supreme Court 64); relevant portion from paragraph No.29 of said 
case law is hereby reproduced: -

“There is no cavil to the proposition, however, it is to be noted that in 
absence of any plausible explanation, this Court has always considered 
the delay in lodging of FIR to be fatal and castes a suspicion on the 
prosecution story, extending the benefit of doubt to the accused. It has 
been held by this Court that a FIR is always treated as a cornerstone of 
the prosecution case to establish guilt against those involved in a crime; 
thus, it has a significant role to play. If there is any delay in lodging of a 
FIR and commencement of investigation, it gives rise to a doubt, which, 
of course, cannot be extended to anyone else except to the accused…” 
 
It is also relevant to mention here that post-mortem examination over dead 
body of the deceased was conducted at 11:30 p.m. on 12.11.2015 and there 
was no administrative reason in hospital for delay in autopsy of dead body 
rather it was due to receiving of documents from police at 11:15 p.m.            
on 12.11.2015 and in this regard, relevant portion of statement of Dr. Ghulam 
Sarwar Cheema (PW-8) is hereby reproduced: - 
“It is correct that doctors were available around the clock in the 
hospital. As soon as I received police papers, I conducted post mortem 
and there was no delay on my part. Police papers were not presented 
before me prior to 11.15 p.m on 12.11.2015.” 
 
Afore-mentioned state of affairs reflects that F.I.R. (Ex.PH/1) was not 
recorded even at the stated time rather with much delay however ante-time 
was mentioned in it and further suggests that none of the cited eyewitnesses 
was present at the “time & place” of occurrence, time was consumed for 
procuring, introducing, engaging eyewitnesses as well as tailoring/concocting 
story after deliberation and consultation for the prosecution and then getting 
the case registered in its present form as well as completing police papers for 
postmortem examination; therefore, neither any sanctity nor evidentiary value 
can be attached to the First Information Report (F.I.R.) in the case and it 
cannot provide any corroboration to the case of prosecution against the 
appellant rather it has lost its efficacy and damaged the case of prosecution; in 
this regard, guidance has been sought from the case of “HAROON SHAFIQUE 
versus The STATE and others”  (2018 SCMR 2118),  “MUHAMMAD RAFIQUE 
alias FEEQA versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR 1068), “MUHAMMAD ADNAN 
and another versus The STATE and others” (2021 SCMR 16) and “GHULAM 
MUSTAFA versus The STATE” (2021 SCMR 542).  
  
Prosecution produced Shazia Siddiq (complainant/wife of 
deceased/ PW-1), Hafiz Muhammad Umar Wakeel (brother of 
deceased/PW-2) and Muhammad Shafiq (brother-in-law of deceased/ 
PW-3).   Admittedly,  Shazia  Siddiq (PW-1) is not eyewitness  of  the

occurrence rather she received information through phone regarding the 
occurrence.   
  
It is not mentioned in the F.I.R. that occurrence was witnessed in the 
light; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of Hafiz Muhammad Umar 
Wakeel (PW-2) is also reproduced below: - 
“I got my statement recorded to police at the spot at 8.30 a.m. I had not 
got recorded in said statement that I had witnessed the occurrence, in 
light. I had got recorded statement in the court on 15.07.2016. I also did 
not get recorded in that statement that I witnessed the occurrence in 
light.”  
 
Similarly, Muhammad Shafiq (PW-3) also did not claim availability of any 
light at the “time & place of occurrence”.  
 
 
Hafiz Muhammad Umar Wakeel (PW-2) and Muhammad Shafiq (PW-3) 
were neither having residence nor business place at or adjacent to the place of 
occurrence; therefore, they both are “chance witnesses”. Though they claimed 
that they were going after taking tea from a tea shop yet neither name of said tea 
shop was disclosed nor owner nor any serving boy/person of said tea shop was 
produced in support of said claim and in this regard, relevant portion of statement 
of Muhammad Shafiq (PW-3) is mentioned as under: - 
 
“Tea seller was not produced before the I.O.” 
 
It was also claim of both said witnesses that they shifted Umair (deceased) in 
injured condition to Civil Hospital, Nowshera Virkan and then to District 
Headquarter Hospital, Gujranwala where he expired after 1½ hours during 
medical treatment but prosecution did not produce any document from said 
hospitals to show that the deceased was brought there by these witnesses and 
in this regard, relevant portion of statement of Hafiz Muhammad Umar 
Wakeel (PW-2) is hereby reproduced below: - 
“I had not got recorded in my statement to I.O. on 12.11.2015 that                   
on 11.11.2015 I and Akhtar were present in Civil Hospital Noshera 
Virkan for treatment of Umair.” 
 
Police station and Civil Hospital, Nowshera Virkan were in front of each 
other; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of Shazia Siddiq (PW-1) is 
reprocured as under: - 
“It is correct that police station and hospital are opposite to each other 
and there is a road only in between the two.” 
 
Similarly, relevant portion of statement of Muhammad Shafiq (PW-3) is 
mentioned below: - 
“Police station is near to the hospital.”

Hafiz Muhammad Umar Wakeel (PW-2) is real brother of the deceased 
whereas Muhammad Shafiq (PW-3) is brother-in-law of the deceased; they 
took the deceased in injured condition to Civil Hospital, Nowshera Virkan and 
then also brought him from District Headquarter Hospital, Gujranwala but did 
not get registered the case promptly; in this regard, relevant portion of 
statement of PW-2 is reproduced as under: - 
“I did not get recorded statement to police in the whole night                        
of 11.11.2015. I did not even make any attempt to inform the police.” 
 
It is also relevant to mention here that Hafiz Muhammad Umar Wakeel             
(PW-2) introduced dishonest improvements during his statement before the 
court regarding injury on right hand; in this regard, relevant portions of his 
statement are reproduced below: - 
“As a result of which, two fire shots hit at bally and one at right hand of 
Umair.”  
“I had got recorded in my statement before the court that fire hit at left 
hand of the deceased. Right hand was not mentioned.”  
 
whereas relevant portion of statement of Muhammad Shafiq (PW-3) is 
mentioned as under: - 
“I had made statement in the court. I had mentioned in the said 
statement that a fire had hit at right hand of Umair. (Confronted with 
Ex.DD where not so recorded). It is incorrect to suggest that I had 
recorded left hand. (Confronted with Ex.DD where it is so recorded).”  
 
Hafiz Muhammad Umar Wakeel (PW-2) and Muhammad Shafiq (PW-3) also 
introduced dishonest improvements regarding making of video of Umair 
(deceased of the case) in injured condition and in this regard, relevant portion 
of statement of PW-2 is reproduced below: - 
“I had not got recorded in said statement that Akhtar made video and 
inquired Umair as to who had injured him. I had also not got recorded 
that Umair replied that Abu Bakar, Master Ansar and Nasir injured 
him. I had not got recorded in said statement that Akhtar made video. 
Volunteered video was not prepared.” 
 
Similarly, relevant portions of statement of Muhammad Shafiq (PW-3) are 
reproduced below: - 
“I had not recorded in said statement that on 11.11.2015 at 8.30 p.m. 
Akhtar made a video of Umair in Civil Hospital Noshehra Virkan in 
my presence and that of Hafiz Umar, or that Akhtar asked Umair as to 
who had injured him, or Umair replied that Master Anser, Abu Bakar 
alias Samosa and Mian Nasir had injured him. Volunteered that                      
on 12.11.2015 nothing was stated by me regarding CD.” 
 
“I had not recorded in Ex.DD the entire story of making video by 
Akhtar on 11.11.2015.”

By now it is well settled that witness who introduces dishonest improvement 
or omission for strengthening the case, cannot be relied; in this regard, case of 
“MUHAMMAD ARIF versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR 631) and  “KHALID 
MEHMOOD and another versus The STATE and others” (2021 SCMR 810) can 
be advantageously referred.  
  
While taking into consideration all the afore-mentioned reasons 
collectively, ocular account produced by the prosecution has not been found 
by us as confidence inspiring or truthful; therefore, same cannot be relied and 
is hereby discarded.  
 
So far as making of video of Umair alias Khalshi (in injured condition) 
through mobile phone by Akhtar Ali (CW-4) on 11.11.2015 at 08:30 p.m., 
preparing CD (P-2) of this video and handing over the same to Investigating 
Officer on 10.02.2016 through recovery memo (Ex.PE) is concerned, suffice 
it to say that Hafiz Muhammad Umar Wakeel (PW-2) and Muhammad Shafiq 
(PW-3) introduced dishonest improvements in this regard (as discussed 
above); as per own claim of the prosecution, said video was prepared at 08:30 
p.m. on 11.11.2015 but why it was not produced to the police during same 
night by Akhtar Ali (CW-4) or at the time of registration of case or on that 
day, and why it was produced after about 3-months of the occurrence, any 
convincing, plausible, cogent and acceptable reason appealing to common 
prudent man could not be brought on the record by the prosecution; in this 
regard, relevant portion of statement of CW-4 is reproduced below: - 
“Police reached at the hospital at about 8:30 p.m. I had not told 
anything about this case to the police at that time. I had also not told to 
the police at police station about this case at that time. Police remained 
in the hospital in my present for about 35/40 minutes. I had also not 
told to the police on the next day about my recording the statement. I 
had also not submitted any application to the police including 
DPO/CPO recording of statement of injured.” 
 
It goes without saying that Akhtar Ali (CW-4) stated in his statement before 
the court that he recorded statement of Umair alias Khalshi in his mobile and 
then converted the statement of deceased from his mobile phone into CD (P-
2) and handed over CD (P-2) to the Investigating Officer; in this regard, 
relevant portion of his statement is mentioned below: - 
 “On 11.11.2015 at about 8:30 p.m. I was present in THQ hospital 
Nowshera Virkan with Umair injured, on my asking he told me that fire 
has been made upon him by Abu Akar alias Samosa, Master Ansar and 
Mian Nasir, I recorded his statement in my mobile after that Umair 
injured died, I also remained silent due to fear after that I converted the

statement of the deceased from my mobile into CD p-2 and handed 
over this CD to the I.O on 10.02.2016 in presence of Hafiz Umar and 
Shafiq and the I.O took into possession this CD vide recovery memo 
Ex.P-E attested by PWs. I.O also recorded my statement.” 
 
In the F.I.R. (Ex.PH/1), presence of Akhtar Ali (CW-4) with Umair alias 
Khalshi (in injured condition) in Civil Hospital, Nowshera Virkan is not 
mentioned. Statement of any doctor that Umair alias Khalshi remained in 
injured condition in Civil Hospital, Nowshera Virkan or he was fit to make 
statement or CW-4 was accompanying said injured, is not available on the 
record.  
 
It is relevant to mention here that dishonest improvement introduced by 
Akhtar Ali (CW-4) qua time i.e. 08:30 p.m. as well as presence of PW-2 and 
PW-3 also stands proved and in this regard, relevant portion of his statement 
is as under: - 
“I recorded my first statement to the police on 10.02.2016 and I had 
recorded in my statement the time of 8:30 p.m. confronted with Ex.DF 
wherein not so recoded. I had also recorded name of Shafiq and Hafiz 
Umar in my statement confronted with Ex.DF wherein not so 
recorded.” 
 
Akhtar Ali (CW-4) even did not sign recovery memo of CD (P-2) i.e. Ex.PE 
and relevant portion of his statement in this regard is reproduced as under: - 
 
“I had not signed Ex.PE.” 
It is also very much relevant to mention here that as per claim of CW-4, 
statement of Umair alias Khalshi (now deceased of the case) was recorded on 
mobile phone, then subsequently converted to CD (P-2) but admittedly said 
mobile was neither produced during investigation nor during trial rather only 
CD (P-2) was produced and by now it is well settled that though conversation 
recorded in Audio or Video can be proved yet production of actual record of 
conversation is necessary for the same; in this regard, case of “ISHTIAQ 
AHMED MIRZA and 2 others Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and 
others” (P L D 2019 Supreme Court 675) can be safely referred and  relevant 
portion of the same is hereby reproduced: - 
“11.  The precedent cases mentioned above show that in the matter of 
proving an audio tape or video before a court of law the following 
requirements are insisted upon: - 
 
 No audio tape or video can be relied upon by a court until the 
same is proved to be genuine and not tampered with or 
doctored.  
…………………………………………………………………... 

Criminal Appeal No.228667-J/2018, 
Criminal Appeal No.213552/2018, 
P.S.L.A. No.211801/2018, 
Crl. Revision No.211803/2018 &   
Murder Reference No.04/2019. 
12
 An audio tape or video sought to be produced in evidence must 
be the actual record of the conversation as and when it was 
made or of the event as and when it took place.  (emphasis added) 
…………………………………………………………………... 
 
 Safe custody of the audio tape or video after its preparation till 
production before the court must be proved. 
………………………………………………………………...” 
 
Therefore, due to non-production of mobile of Akhtar Ali (CW-4) wherein 
statedly said conversation of Umair alias Khalshi (now deceased of the case) 
was recorded, said conversation has not been proved and by production of 
afore-mentioned CD (P-2), said conversation cannot be proved; therefore, its 
forensic analysis is also of no avail.  
So far as medical evidence is concerned, it is trite law that medical 
evidence is mere supportive/confirmatory type of evidence; it can tell about 
locale, nature, magnitude of injury and kind of weapon used for causing injury 
but it cannot tell about identity of the assailant who caused the injury; therefore, 
same is also of no help to the prosecution in peculiar facts and circumstances of 
the case, in this regard, case of “SAJJAN SOLANGI versus The STATE” 
(2019 SCMR 872) can be safely referred.  
 
It also goes without saying that nothing was recovered from Master 
Ansar, Jamshed and Javed (appellants) whereas on 25.03.2016, a pistol .30 
bore (P-7) was recovered on the pointing out of Abu Bakar alias Samosa (one 
of the appellants) but empties/cartridge cases secured from the place of 
occurrence were not found to have been fired from said pistol as per report of 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (EX.PR); therefore, said recovery is 
inconsequential and of no help to the prosecution.  
 
Now coming to motive of the occurrence; it was mentioned in the 
application (Ex.PA), F.I.R. (Ex.PH/1) and complaint (Ex.PB) that Umair alias 
Khalshi (deceased of the case) was an eyewitness of case arising out of F.I.R. 
No.637/2012 registered under Section: 302 PPC at Police Station: Nowshera 
Virkan but admittedly, none of the present appellants was accused in said 
case; so it was not directly against them; furthermore, motive is a double 
edged weapon, it cuts both the ways, it can also be a reason for false 
implication; even otherwise, when substantive evidence has been discarded, 
then motive looses its significance and becomes immaterial for conviction.  
9. 
It is well established principle of law that single dent/circumstance in 
case of prosecution is sufficient for acquittal; in this regard, case of “ABDUL 
GHAFOOR versus The STATE” (2022 S C M R 1527) can be safely referred.

10.  
Nutshell of the above discussion is that prosecution has been failed to 
prove its case against the appellants; therefore, there is no need to discuss 
defence version. 
11. 
In view of, what has been discussed above, Criminal Appeal              
No.228667-J/2018 filed by Abu Bakar alias Samosa, Jamshed, Javed 
(appellants) and Criminal Appeal No.213552/2018 filed by Master Anser 
(appellant), are allowed; convictions recorded and sentences awarded to the 
appellants through impugned judgment dated: 19.04.2018 are hereby set aside.  
Appellants are acquitted of the charge; Abu Bakar alias Samosa (appellant) shall 
be released from the jail forthwith, if not required in any other case whereas 
Master Ansar, Jamshed and Javed (appellants) are on bail as during pendency 
of the appeals, execution of their sentences were suspended by this Court, 
therefore, their sureties stand discharged from their liabilities of bail bonds.   
12. 
Resultantly, death sentence awarded to Abu Bakar alias Samosa 
(appellant) is NOT CONFIRMED and Murder Reference (M. R. No.04 of 
2019) is answered in NEGATIVE. 
13.   So far as acquittal of Mian Nasir and Mst. Bismillah Begum 
(respondents) 
passed 
by 
trial 
court 
through 
impugned 
judgment                       
dated: 19.04.2018 is concerned, we have noticed that in the application 
(Ex.PA) and F.I.R. (Ex.PH/1), name of any witness of abetment is not 
mentioned rather Yasmin Kausar (PW-6) and Muhammad Yousaf (PW-7) 
were subsequently introduced as witnesses of abetment and the trial court 
while disbelieving their evidence in paragraphs No.24 and 25 of the impugned 
judgment, has observed as under: - 
“24.  Admittedly, Yasmeen Kausor PV-6 is close relative of the 
complainant and in her cross examination admitted that she had never 
disclosed this fact to Shazia Saddique. PW-7 Muhammad Yousif has 
not corroborated the conspiracy as deposed by Yasmeen Kausor PW-6 
and both these witnesses also admitted in their cross examination that 
they did not tell this fact to complainant, and PW-7 also admitted that 
he did not know whether Shazia Saddique complainant had heard about 
the abetment or not. Both the PWs of ocular account PW-2~PW-3 
along with complainant (PW-1) who deposed that this occurrence has 
been committed on the abetment of accused Mian Nasir and Bismillah 
Begum has never stated and named these two witnesses regarding the 
abetment. PW-7 admitted in his cross examination that on 28.03.2016 
he made statement to the police and these two witnesses are deposing 
the evidence regarding conspiracy dated 03.11.2015 and 07.11.2015, it 
means they remained silent and no written application regarding 
abetment was made to the police. It seems that these two witnesses 
have been mounoward regarding the role of abetment to the accused  
 
25.  
Adnan Shahzad SI (CW-3) admitted in his cross examination 
that no material was produced before him during investigation against 

Criminal Appeal No.228667-J/2018, 
Criminal Appeal No.213552/2018, 
P.S.L.A. No.211801/2018, 
Crl. Revision No.211803/2018 &   
Murder Reference No.04/2019.

the accused Bismiallah Begum volunteered oral evidence was 
available, copy of passport (Ex.DG) of Mian Nasir accused also shows 
that he is national of UK and at the time of occurrence was in England, 
in his statement u/s 342 Cr.P.C he also took the plea, which corroborate 
with his passport (Ex. DG). The oral evidence which has been 
discussed above, to the extent of accused Mian Nasir and Bismillah 
Begum, is not confidence inspiring, so the prosecution has failed to 
prove the charge against the accused Nasir and Bismillah Begum 
regarding abetment.  
 
Hence, for the reasons mentioned in paragraphs No.24 and 25 of the 
impugned judgment, acquittal of Mian Nasir and Mst. Bismillah Begum is 
neither perverse, nor capricious nor arbitrary rather judgment in this regard 
has been passed perfectly in accordance with law, facts and record of the case. 
After acquittal, accused persons have attained double presumption of 
innocence and courts are always slow to disturb the same and in this regard, 
reliance can be placed upon the case of “HAJI PAIO KHAN versus SHER 
BIAZ and others” (2009 SCMR 803) and “MUHAMMAD SHAFI alias 
KHDDOO versus The State and others” (2019 SCMR 1045); from, latter case 
law, relevant portion is reproduced:- 
“It is by now well settled that acquittal carries with it double 
presumption of innocence; it is reversed only when found blatantly 
perverse, resting upon fringes of impossibility and resulting into 
miscarriage of justice. It cannot be set aside merely on the possibility 
of a contra view.” 
 
Thus, P.S.L.A. No.211801/2018 is dismissed.  
14.  
For the reasons recorded supra, Criminal Revision No.211803/2018 
filed by Shazia Siddiq (complainant/PW-1) for enhancement of sentences of 
Master Ansar, Jamshed and Javed, also stands dismissed.
