ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. This Constitutional Petition was 
filed in the public interest litigation, inter-alia seeking directions 
against the respondents to treat the prisoners of 'District Jail' and 
'Kot Lakhpat Jail, Lahore' (Jails) according to Pakistan Prisoners 
Code (Jail Manual) and shift the inmates to other Jail(s), who have 
been detained therein beyond the capacity of the Jails. The 
direction was also sought to shift the mental patient/prisoners from 
the Jails to Mental Hospital, Lahore where they may be treated 
properly and comfortably. The respondents were also required to 
shift the addict prisoners to the Drug Centers established in the 
private sectors.  
2. 
This Court treated the instant public interest Petition as a 
rolling review and continuing mandamus, and while adopting an 
inquisitorial approach, summoned 
the 
concerned public 
functionaries along with their focal persons to render full 
assistance for addressing the highlighted chronic issues. In this 
regard, two Committees were constituted; one to oversee the 
constructions of new Jails, and the other to revamp and modernize

the Prison Industries, ensuring the effective implementation and 
sustainable outcomes. 
3. 
Heard the learned counsel for parties and representatives of 
the respondents-departments.  
4. 
'Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela' — an anti-apartheid activist, 
politician, first Black president of South Africa; ideologically an 
African nationalist and socialist — in his famous saying observed: 
“No one truly knows a Nation until one has been 
inside the jails. The Nation should not be judged by 
how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones.” 
Meticulous perusal of the replies/reports and orders passed by this 
Court from time to time in this Petition demonstrates that this 
Petition was filed in 2010 and thereafter, various orders were 
passed and steps were taken addressing the critical issues being 
faced in Punjab Prisons, including the overcrowding, poor-
infrastructure and prisoners’ inadequate rehabilitation programs 
etc. The record transpires that at the time of filing of this Writ 
Petition, there were thirty-two (32) Jails housed 52,803 prisoners 
against an authorized capacity of 21,527, resulting in 
overcrowding of 146%; however, over the last fourteen-years, 
sustained reforms have significantly improved the conditions of 
Prisons across the Punjab.  
5. 
During pendency of this Petition, 13 new Prisons were 
constructed across the Punjab, bringing the total number of jails to 
43 by 2024; these include District Jail in Okara, Pakpattan, 
Layyah, Bhakkar and Rajanpur as well as two High-Security 
Prisons in District Sahiwal and Mianwali. This infrastructural 
development increased the authorized capacity to 37,563 inmates, 
which is a significant improvement from year 2010 baseline. 
Notably, new facilities were strategically planned to serve those 
Districts where no Prisons previously existed, ensuring equitable 
distribution of the resources. Additionally, the steps have been 

(-3-) 
Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
taken to address future needs with plans to construct Jails in 
District Nankana Sahib, Chiniot & Khushab.  
6. 
To further alleviate the overcrowding, substantial strides 
were made in construction of barracks and death-cells in Punjab 
Prisons. Between 2010 & 2024, 140 new barracks and 928 
additional death cells were constructed, providing accommodation 
for over Four Thousand inmates. These developments align with 
the constitutional protection and the international standards, 
ensuring that the basic rights of inmates particularly those 
awaiting trial or execution are safeguarded. The comprehensive 
reforms in infrastructure of the Punjab Prisons led to complete 
reconstruction of Borstal Jail, Faisalabad. For the facility, which 
had suffered from serious structural deficiencies, a detailed 
renovation plan was approved in 2020 which included rebuilding 
of the main-walls, construction of double-story barracks, and 
adding a kitchen block. These improvements were completed and 
the facilities became fully operational on January 30, 2024. 
Similarly, new women barracks at District Jail, Sargodha were 
completed and became functional on February 12, 2023; these 
barracks designed with complete isolation and a double-lock 
system, ensuring the safety and dignity of female prisoners. The 
security-wall was constructed in Gujrat which further enhanced 
the safety and modernization of the Prisons.  
7. 
The reforms directed in this Petition resulted into total 45 
judicial lockups across the Punjab and 17 lockups are now fully 
operational, and significantly upgraded. One lockup in Shujabad 
has already been converted into a sub-jail and the projects in 
Sumandari and Pindi Bhattian are close to completion. The 
reforms strengthened the security measures across the Punjab 
Prisons System including procurement of arms and ammunition to 
enhance safety in various district Jails both for the inmates and for 
Prisons Staff. The reforms stemming from the instant Petition 

(-4-) 
Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
have significantly advanced the protection of prisoners’ rights 
particularly regarding their family relationships.  
8. 
In progressive move to uphold conjugal rights, 54 family 
rooms across the Central Jails in Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi 
& Multan have been constructed with kitchen and washroom 
facilities, providing long-term prisoners with the opportunity to 
spend time with their families promoting the family bonds and 
respecting human rights of the inmates. The substantial 
improvements made in care and treatment of mentally ill 
prisoners, ensuring compliance with the relevant legal frameworks 
including Mental Health Ordinance, 2001 and the law settled by 
the Supreme Court in "Safia Bano Vs. Home Department, 
Government of Punjab" (PLD 2021 SC 488). To streamline the 
management of jail hospitals, control has been transferred from 
Punjab Prisons to the Primary and Secondary Healthcare 
Department (P&SHD) as of December, 2023. To address the staff 
shortage and improve their morales, significant efforts have been 
made to upgrade Prisons Staff in Punjab. In alignment with the 
Standard Minimum Rules for treatment of the prisoners, personnel 
within the Prison System were granted enhanced salaries and 
allowances to attract and retain qualified staff. 
9. 
Noteworthy strides have been made in modernizing Prison 
Management in Punjab through implementation of automation 
and digitalization systems. Biometrics verification have also been 
introduced across all Prisons and the records have been fully 
digitalized under the Prison Management Information System 
(PMIS) ensuring the enhanced transparency and streamlined 
operations. In addition to these upgrades, video trial system has 
been installed in nine Central Jails and nine divisional Anti-
Terrorism Courts (ATCs) across the province. This initiative aims 
to reduce transportation costs and delays by enabling the prisoners 
to attend the Court hearing remotely, thus expediting the judicial 

(-5-) 
Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
process. The project is set to expand with plans to install video 
trial systems in all remaining jails in coming years. In alignment 
with the Court’s directives issued in the instant Petition, important 
steps have also been taken to reduce the energy costs and the 
environmental impact of Prison System by installing solar panels 
in three Central Jails; Faisalabad, Mianwali and DG Khan. The 
solar penal system at Central Jail Faisalabad became operational 
on 01.04.2023 and similarly the solar penal systems at Central 
Jails Mianwali & DG Khan were activated in years 2023 & 2024, 
respectively. Encouraged by the success of these initiatives, there 
is a development plan to solarize ten additional jails as part of 
Annual Development Programme 2024-25. The focus is also 
made on balanced diets, clean drinking water and hygienic living 
conditions of the prisoners.  
10. 
To ensure protection of vulnerable groups including 
women, children and transgender, separate facilities were created 
for these groups, providing with specialized care, vocational 
training, healthcare and legal assistance. The reforms of Jail 
Industries in Punjab have been introduced, which played a crucial 
role in the economic stability of the Prison System while also 
providing inmates with valuable vocational trainings and financial 
initiatives. This will also ensure the prisoners with skills and 
earnings that contribute to their rehabilitation and reintegration 
into the society. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has 
been signed between the Technical Education and Vocational 
Training Authority (TEVTA) and the Prisons Department to 
provide technical education and vocational training to male, 
female and juvenile prisoners across the Punjab. This initiative 
aims to equip the inmates with essential skills to aid their 
rehabilitation and reintegration into the society.

General of Prisons, Lahore on actions taken regarding the Reforms 

(-6-) 
Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
in Prison administration and redressal of grievances of the 
prisoners, has been filed in this Constitutional Petition. The 
relevant part of the said report is reproduced as under: 
“4. 
When the instant case filed in Hon’ble Lahore High 
Court in 2010, 52803 prisoners were confined in 32 Jails of 
Punjab Province against the authorized accommodation 21527 
(overcrowding was around 146%). Punjab Prisons was 
conscious of the fact and took unprecedented steps to improve 
the plight of prisoners in the province. Since 2010, 928 
additional death cells (48 in Central Jail, Lahore) and 140 
Barracks have been constructed in Punjab Prisons. Similarly, 
construction work of 13 new jails in the districts where 
previously no jail existed has been completed. 
 
A.

Construction work of 
main wall of B.I & J. 
Jail, Faisalabad 
Construction work of B.I &J. Jail, Faisalabad 
was completed on 08.01.2001. Since its 
functioning 
the 
standard 
of 
construction 
remained objectionable. The land of jail is 
severely affected with water logging and salinity. 
In fact, the building was constructed without 
taking any preventing measures against the 
affected land which resulted in the damage of 
whole jail building from its plinth level. Owing 
to the reasons, the enclosure walls and main wall

Punjab Prison has initiated automation of major 
functions of prison administration under prison 
management information system with the co-ordination 
of Punjab Information Technology Board. So far, 21 
prisons have been automated and the same is being 
replicated in other jails of Punjab. 
ii. Video Trial System has been installed in 9 Central Jails 
of Punjab & 9 Divisional ATCs of Punjab and same will 
also be installed in all remaining jails of Punjab in 
coming years. The project will not only decrease the 
expenditure spent on the fuel for transporting the 
prisoner to the respective courts but also help to 
complete the trial in reasonable time.

RIGHTS 
OF 
THE 
PRISONERS 
PROTECTED BY THE AUTHORITIES 
 
In his speech at the official launch of the re-training and human 
rights project of the South African Department of Correctional 
Services, the former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, 
stressed the importance of both security and justice in the 
administrating of prisons in these words: 
 
The full contribution which our prisons can make 
towards a permanent reduction in the country’s crime-
rate lies also in the way in which they treat prisoners. 
We cannot emphasize enough the importance of both 
professionalism and respect for human rights.”

Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
 
With the rise of the subject of human rights after the World War-
II, protection of the rights of the prisoners is key to safe and 
secure prisons. Incarceration does not curtail the fundamental 
rights especially right to life and right to fair trial provided to 
the prisoners under the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan and International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
In the instant Writ Petition the Hon’ble High Court ensured the 
protection of the following rights of the prisoners: 
 
RIGHT TO LIFE (FOOD) 
 
To provide, healthy and balanced diet to the inmates under rule 
260 of Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978, menu for inmates was 
revised on 30 May 2014 in consultations with nutritionists and 
food technology experts from University of Agriculture, 
Faisalabad. The Government further enhanced the dietary 
expenditures to Rs.59.61 per prisoner per day on 30.05.2014. 
Moreover, milk is provided to the suckling babies under rule 489 
of Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978.  Further, special diet is provided 
to the inmates on Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Azha. Moreover, all 
essential dietary ingredients including cooking oil, packed milk, 
tea leaves etc. have been standardized in consultation with 
nutrition experts and those ingredients are purchased from 
renowned firms having trusted brands.  
Special diet menu was devised through the consultation and 
recommendation of Nutritionists of Faisalabad, Agriculture 
University.

RESPECT FOR DIGNITY 
Overcrowded prisons damage the self-respect and ego of the 
prisoners as a human being. At the same time, congested 
incarceration conditions lead to physical and mental torture. To 
ensure the dignity of the prisoners, the Government has 
enhanced the capacity by building 12 new jails. The relevant 
part of the Nelson Mandela Rules in his famous saying is 
reproduced here: 
“It is said that no one truly knows a Nation until one has 
been inside the jails. Nation should not be judged by how 
it treats its highest citizen, but its lowest one”. 
 
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY AGAINST TORTURE 

(-16-) 
Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment of Punishment, Article 10: 
Each State – Party shall ensure that education and 
information regarding the prohibition against torture 
are fully included in the training of law enforcement 
personnel, civil or military, medical personnel, public 
officials and other persons who may be involved in the 
custody, interrogation or treatment of any individual 
subjected to any form of arrest, detention or 
imprisonment. 
Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, Article 3:  
Law enforcement officials may use force only when 
strictly necessary and to the extent required for the 
performance of their duty. 
 
 
European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 4: 
 
No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. 
 
As a state party to convention against torture, Pakistan 
has taken several measures to discourage custodial 
torture. Simultaneously, Inspectorate of Prisons Punjab 
has taken concreate steps to ensure a good control of 
prisoners by strengthening the dynamic component of 
the security. All the Superintendent Jails in Punjab have 
already been directed to adopt zero tolerance policy 
against 
the 
torture 
and 
maltreatment. 
The 
Superintendent of jails have been sensitized that all types 
of torture both mental and physical have been 
recognized as a cognizable offence under the Torture 
and Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act, 
2022. 
 
MEDICAL TREATMENT AT STATE’s EXPENSE 
Those who are imprisoned retain their fundamental rights to 
enjoy good health, both physical and mental, and they retain 
their entitlement to the standard of medical care which is, at-
least, the equivalent of that provided in the wider community. 
The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Culture 
Rights (Article 12) establishes:  
The right of every one to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health. 
 
When a state deprived the people of their liberty, it takes on 
responsibility to look after their health. In terms of both of the 
conditions under which it detains them and of the individual, 
which may be necessary as results of those conditions. 
 
In order to streamline the existing health care management 
system in line with the fundamental rights enshrined in the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 international 
best practices and United Nation Guidelines for the treatment of 
prisoners, the Government of the Punjab has taken initiative to 
hand over management and budgetary control of jail hospitals 
to Primary and Secondary Health Care Department. District 
Prison Health Council under the chair of respective Deputy

and responsibilities of District Prison Health Council vide 
notification No.SO(Prs)2-Gen/2021 dated 20.12.2023. 
 
In the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
reported PLD 2021 SC 488, Government of the Punjab 
Specialized Healthcare and Medical Education Department 
constituted a medical board to examine and assess the under-

SUPPLY OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER 
• Rule 22 of the United Nation Standard Minimum Rules for 
the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules) says: 
2. 
Drinking water shall be available to every 
prisoner whenever he or she needs it. 
 
To safeguard the right to life enshrined in the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the United Nation Standard 
Minimum Rules for the treatment of prisoners, the following 
steps have been taken for the supply of clean drinking water to 
the prisoners:  
• Total Eighty-six (86) water filtration plants have been 
installed at different jails in the Punjab with the co-
operation of different NGOs and under ADP Schemes. 
• 35 water filtration plants have been installed under Annual 
Development Program (ADP) Schemes. 
• 51 water filtration plants have been installed with the 
collaboration of NGOs and philanthropists. 
• For the provision of cold drinking water, 300 Electric Water 
Coolers have been provided to all Jails with the cooperation 
of Qarshi Foundation 
• 100 Electric Water Chillers with the cost of Rs.88,00,000/- 
have been provided to the Punjab Jails. 
CONJUGAL RIGHTS 
• Rule 58 of the United Nation Standard Minimum Rules for the 
treatment of prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules) says: 
2. 
Where conjugal visits are allowed, this right 
shall be applied without discrimination, and 
women prisoners shall be able to exercise 
this right on an equal basis with men. 
Procedures shall be in place and premises 
shall be made available to ensure fair and 
equal access with due regard to safety and 
dignity.

• Thus, the Government of Punjab has constructed family 
rooms along-with attached kitchen and washrooms at four 
jails i.e. Central Jails at Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad and 
Rawalpindi. To facilitate conjugal visits, amendment in 
Pakistan Prisons Rules, 1978 has been incorporated in rule 
545-A. The aforementioned rule permits the convicts 
sentenced to long-term imprisonment (exceeding five years) 
may exercise this right three times in a year for three 
consecutive days. The family visits have been permitted to 
ensure rights of prisoners in accordance with opinion of 
Council of Islamic Ideology. 
 
COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS AND LEGAL 
COUNSEL  
 
Rule 58 of Nelson Mandela Rules says: 
1. Prisoners shall be allowed, under necessary 
supervision, to communicate with their family and 
friends at regular intervals:  
(a) 
By corresponding in writing and using, 
where 
available, 
telecommunication, 
electronic, digital and other means; and 
(b) 
By receiving visits. 
▪ To facilitate relatives, friends and the legal counsels of the 
prisoners, waiting shed has been constructed, equipped with all 
the sitting facilities, bathrooms and drinking water in all jails of 
the Punjab. 
 
▪ PCO facility has been provided to prisoners in all Jails of Punjab. 
Under this facility a prisoner is allowed to make a phone call once 
a week to his / her family member, friend and legal counsel. 
PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF VULNERABLE 
GROUPS (WOMEN, CHILDEREN, TRANSGENDER) 
 
WOMEN 
Women and the juveniles fall under the category of 
vulnerable group of prisoners due to their gender and 
age. Article 25(3) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan empowers state to make special provisions 
to protect the rights of women and children. Rule 11 of 
Nelson Mandela Rule says: 
 
The different categories of prisoners shall be kept in 
separate institutions or parts of institutions, taking 
account of their sex, age, criminal record, the legal 
reason for their detention and the necessities of their 
treatment; thus: (a) Men and women shall so far as 
possible be detained in separate institutions; in an 
institution which receives both men and women, the 
whole of the premises allocated to women shall be 
entirely separate. 
The women due to their gender face discrimination and 
hardship in special settings of prisons. At present, 1167 
female prisoners in different categories are confined in 
Punjab Jails which constitute 2% of the Punjab Prisons 
population. One of the first areas of discrimination is 

(-19-) 
Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
that of accommodation. Punjab Prison have one women 
prison used exclusively for women prisoners. In these 
circumstances, many imprisoned women are held on 
accommodation which is far away from their families, 
making family contact much more difficult. In other 
Jails, one special portion is set-apart for keeping female 
prisoners and after conviction, these prisoners are 
shifted to Women Jail Multan, Central Jail Sahiwal, 
Central Jail Lahore, Central Jail Rawalpindi, Central 
Jail Gujranwala, District Jail Faisalabad and District 
Jail Sialkot where they are imparted technical training 
in various trades. The living condition of women 
prisoner have been improved by providing them double 
decker iron cots, foam mattresses, air coolers, water 
chillers and vocational trainings etc. However, the 
confinement of the females in male facilities entails 
discrimination and restriction. It may pose an increased 
risk to the safety of the women and may also result in the 
facilities available to them being determined by the 
needs of the larger number of male prisoners. Besides, 
access to those facilities and time out of cell may be 
further restricted on security grounds. 
 
JUVENILES 
United Nation Convention on Right of Child, (UNCRC) Article 
37(1)(c) says: 
• Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with 
humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the 
human person, and in a manner which takes into account 
the needs of persons of his or her age. In particular, 
every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from 
adults unless it is considered in the child’s best interest 
not to do so and shall have the right to maintain contact 
with his or her family through correspondence and visits, 
save in exceptional circumstances. 
 
When juvenile is admitted in prison, the prison administration 
has an obligation to care in a manner which takes account of 
age and special needs. There are two folds reasons for a special 
treatment. Firstly, children and young persons are more 
vulnerable than adults and need to be protected from violence 
or abuse by older prisoners or even by staff. Secondly, young 
persons are generally more likely to respond to positive 
influences, to training and to educational opportunities. That is 
why, prison administration must make special arrangements to 
ensure that the corrosive elements of prison life are kept to 
minimum and that maximum use is made of the possibilities for 
training and personal development. 
 
At present, 932 juvenile prisoners are confined in Punjab Jails. 
02 special Jails for keeping juvenile prisoners are functioning at 
Bahawalpur and Faisalabad. In other Jails, one special portion 
is set apart for keeping juvenile under-trial prisoners. After 
conviction, these prisoners are shifted to B.I. & J. Jails located 

(-20-) 
Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
at Bahawalpur and Faisalabad where they are imparted 
technical training in different trades. The Government of the 
Punjab vide its letter No.SO(MP)15-17/2024 dated 16.05.2024 
issued SOPs, for ensuring that juvenile prisoners confined in 
Borstal Institutions of Punjab are treated in a way that is in 
consonance with the spirit of the Borstal Act, 1926, Juvenile 
Justice System Act, 2018 and United Nations Standard Minimum 
Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (“The Beijing 
Rules”).  
 
TRANSGENDERS 
In line with section 6 (b) of the Transgender Persons (Protection 
of Rights) Act, 2018.  Transgender are kept separate from both 
male and female prisoners and properly looked-after with due 
regard to human dignity in Punjab Prisons. As regards, convict 
labour, the transgender convicted prisoners may be assigned 
suitable work considering their physiognomy and sex 
assignment at the time of birth. Labour allotted to transgender 
convicts may specially be focused to make them skillful in some 
trade to earn their livelihood respectably after release. 
 
HUMAN TREATMENT TO DEATH ROW PRISONERS 
As per the case law developed by the European Court for Human 
Rights, hard physical conditions in jail has a deleterious impact 
on the prisoners incarcerated in death cells. Isolation due to 
security restrictions and condition of congested cells tantamount 
to torture. The European court for Human Rights in Soaring Vs. 
United Kingdom (UK) declared that confinement of prisoner 
under sentence of death in isolation and overcrowded cells 
constitute inhuman and degrading treatment. In this case law, 
European court of Human Rights coined the term “death row 
phenomenon”. 
Moreover, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in its Judgment dated 
05.06.2024 passed in case Criminal Review Petition No.103 of 
2017 in Criminal Appeal No. 643 of 2009 titled as Ghulam 
Shabbir Vs. the State reflected the miseries of the death row 
prisoners confined in different jails in Punjab. The relevant part 
of the judgment is reproduced as under: 
The living conditions in death cell are miserable and 
altogether different from the living conditions of other 
prisoners, including lifers. In death cell, the convict is 
under a strict supervision, surveillance and is isolated. 
The space of a cell provided for each condemned 
prisoner is about 9 x 12 feet, with a single toilet to be 
used jointly by all the prisoners confined in their 
respective cells, which compromises their privacy. 
 
To ameliorate the sufferings of prisoner under sentence of death 
in Punjab Prisons, the Government of the Punjab has 
constructed 564 additional death cells in Punjab Prisons since 
2010. At present, 2194 unconfirmed condemned prisoners are 
confined in Punjab Jails. As per amendment made in rule 330 of 
Pakistan Prisons Rules, 1978 vide notification No.SO(MP)9-1-
G/2005(P) dated 10.09.2009, only those condemned prisoners 

(-21-) 
Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
are kept in death cells whose death sentences have been 
confirmed by the Hon’able High Court. Moreover, they have 
been permitted to occupy the courtyard for (strolling) an hour, 
each morning and evening in the light of rule 340(i) of Pakistan 
Prisons Rules, 1978. They are being kept in Security Barracks 
and all facilities are being provided to them under the prisons 
rules which are available to the under-trial / convicted 
prisoners.  
 
BALANCE BETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF THE PRISONERS 
AND THE STAFF 
 
One of the most important findings of the report produced by 
Lord Justice Woolf after a number of very serious riots in 
English prisons in 1990 was that the maintenance of a correct 
balance between security, control and justice is the key to an 
effectively managed prison. 
“There are three requirements which must be met if the 
prison system is to be stable: they are security, control 
and justice. 
 
For present purposes, “security” refers to the obligation 
of the Prison Service to prevent prisoners escaping. 
“Control” deals with the obligation of the Prison Service 
to prevent prisoners being disruptive. “Justice” refers to 
the obligations of the Prison Service to treat prisoners 
with humanity and fairness and to prepare them for their 
return to the community”. 
 
[Lord Justice Woolf, Prison Disturbances, April 1990 
(The Woolf Report), 1991]. 
 
Prisons cannot select their prisoners. They have to accept 
whoever is sent to them by the learned courts or the legal 
authority. They can, however, choose their staff, it is essential 
that the staff should be carefully selected, properly trained, 
supervised and supported. To protect the rights of the prisoners, 
it is essential to impart due importance to the prisons staff in 
terms of their recruitment, training and salary. In compliance 
with this Court Orders dated 06.04.2018, the Punjab Prisons 
has taken the following steps for the welfare of the staff: 
i. 
Up-gradation of Chief Warder, Head Warder 
and Warder 
ii. 
Prison Security Allowance to all the officers / 
officials of the Prisons Department. 
  
Punjab Prisons Staff Training College has been established at 
Sahiwal district to impart training to prisons staff upto Deputy 
Superintendent Jail. The Government of the Punjab has 
conferred a status of attached department to ensure 
administrative and financial autonomy of the institution. 
 
12. 
From the above comprehensive report, it is evident that 
since filing of this Petition in 2010, significant improvements have 
been introduced in Prison administration and to alleviate the plight 
of the prisoners. Indeed, this is not enough and there is much more 

(-22-) 
Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
to be done for further improvements in Prisons Management

In view of the above discussion, this Writ Petition is 
disposed of with the following recommendations (framed in 

(-23-) 
Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
consultation with the respective parties) to be looked into and 
considered by the concerned Authorities for making further future 
improvements in Prisons Management System: 
i) 
Keeping in view the number of female prisoners, 
establishment of Women Jails at Lahore, Faisalabad 
and Rawalpindi is necessary to protect the rights of 
female prisoners confined in male Prisons. 
ii) 
To help long-term prisoners to re-integrate into the 
society, Prisons Authority may establish Open Prison 
with “minimum security” for confinement of the 
convicted prisoners in last year of the sentence. 
iii) 
In line with Rule 6 of the Standard Minimum Rules for 
the treatment of prisoners, Punjab Prisons may 
introduce Electronic Prisoner File Management System 
to impart transparency and efficiency in Prisons 
Management and digitalize all the prisoners record with 
NADRA. 
iv) 
To streamline the legal process and reduce delays, 
digitalization of Courts records, Prisons and the 
Prosecution and their integration. At the same time, 
option of the trial through video link may be exercised, 
if possible, to reduce delay. 
v) 
Currently, 3200 prisoners belonging to territorial 
jurisdiction of ICT are incarcerated in Central Jail, 
Rawalpindi. The construction of Prison facility at 
Islamabad may reduce congestion in Central Jail, 
Rawalpindi. 
vi) 
In line with Rule 83 of the United Nation Standard 
Minimum Rules for treatment of the prisoners (Nelson 
Mandela Rules), Punjab Prisons should establish 
external 
inspection 
mechanism 
to 
ensure 
the 
accountability and transparency in Prisons System. 

(-24-) 
Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
vii) Revisions of relevant Rules in conformity with the 
United Nation Standard Minimum Rules (Nelson 
Mandela Rules) and the directions of the High Courts 
and the Supreme Court of Pakistan passed in different 
cases to protect the rights of prisoners enshrined in the 
constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
viii) The Prisons Staff must be trained to deal with 
dangerous, psychological disturbed, drug addicts, 
death-row prisoners and the prisoners have tendency to 
inflict self-harm or injury.  
ix) 
Currently, all the mentally ill prisoners are transferred 
from different Jails to the Punjab Institute of Mental 
Health for their treatment. In this regard, it is proposed 
that Psychiatric Ward or independent hospital on the 
analogy of Punjab Institute of Mental Health may be 
established at regional level, especially at Rawalpindi 
and Multan to ensure the treatment and confinement of 
mentally ill prisoners inconformity with the guidelines 
stipulated by Supreme Court in case titled “Safia Bano 
Vs. The State” (PLD 2021 SC 488). 
x) 
Revamping of the Jail Industries to equip the inmates 
with essential skills to aid their rehabilitation and 
reintegration into the society. 
xi) 
Educational Syllabus may be matched with the public 
or private institutions. 
xii) It is argued by the petitioners that the law of release of 
prisoners on parole, with good conduct and behaviuor, 
is misused by jail authorities and almost all such 
prisoners are kept as domestic workers at the residence 
of officers. This may hurt the self-esteem and ego of 
prisoners. In the circumstances, the procedure of release 
on parole may be simplified and such parole prisoners 

(-25-) 
Writ Petition No.16322/2010 
 
 
 
 
should be engaged in community service, in industry 
and commercial institutions. This will make the 
prisoners, a productive member of the society and 
facilitate him/her in rehabilitation. 
xiii) The recommendations of the Parole Board, established 
under Section 10 of the Punjab Probation and Parole 
Service Act, 2019, may also include nature of work and 
employment of the prisoner assessed on the basis of 
qualification, skill and age, to be released on parole. 
Parolees may preferably be employed by an 
organization, institution, or industrial unit. 
xiv) In conformity with the best practices, the Punjab 
Probation Service may develop the quantifiable 
mechanism to conduct need assessment and risk 
assessment of the prisoners to be released on parole as 
enunciated under Section 12 of the Punjab Probation 
and Parole Service Act, 2019. 
xv) Keeping in view the role of Probation Officer, defined 
in District Criminal Justice Coordination Committee 
under Police Order, 2002, and Juvenile Justice 
Committee under Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018, 
the Government of Punjab may expedite the process of 
revamping Probation and Parole Service including 
training of the probation officers, up-gradation and 
infrastructure. 
 
15. 
It is further directed that on future improvements in Prison 
Management System including on aforesaid recommendations, a 
quarterly progress report shall be submitted to this Court’s 
Monitoring/Administrative Judge of the Prisons/ Jails in Punjab. 
16. 
Before parting with this judgment, I would like to pay 
tribute and acknowledge the industrious work rendered by the
