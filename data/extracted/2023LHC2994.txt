Advocate. 
Respondent 
No.3 By: 
M/s Summair Jabbar and Bilal 
Ahmad, Advocates. 
 
Anwaar Hussain J: The dispute relates to the property left by 
one Khursheed Sherwani, who admittedly died issueless on 
10.11.2008 and at the time of her death, was owner of double storey 
house, bearing No.18/352 measuring 05 Marlas, situated in Mohallah 
Dera Araiyan, Sialkot (“the house”). The petitioners are children of 
one Mumtaz Begum, who was admittedly real sister of the deceased 
Khursheed Sherwani. Respondent No.2, namely, Munsaf Khan (now 
deceased) was married to the deceased Khursheed Sherwani. Munsaf 
khan sold 1/2 (half) of the house, that constitutes the suit property, to 
respondent No.3, namely, Khalid Javed, through an agreement to sell 
dated 03.02.2012 (“the agreement”). It finds mention in the 
agreement that the entire sale price was paid and possession of the 
said share was given to respondent No.3 but the sale deed was not 
executed in time for which suit for specific performance of the 
agreement was instituted by respondent No.3, against Munsaf Khan. 
The suit was ex-parte decreed in favour of respondent No.3, vide 
judgment and decree dated 19.12.2013, whereafter the execution 
petition was filed by respondent No.3. During the execution 
proceedings, Sultani Baynama was registered. It is the case of 
respondent No.3 that formal possession of the suit property i.e., 1/2

W.P No.3264/2020 
(half) share out of the house was given, to respondent No.3, during the 
execution proceedings by raising a wall and in the remaining portion 
of the house, the petitioners are, admittedly, residing as the legal heirs 
of the deceased Khursheed Sherwani.  
2. 
The petitioners approached the learned Trial Court, by filing an 
application, under Section 12(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
(“the CPC”), laying challenge to the ex-parte judgment and decree 
dated 19.12.2013, passed in suit for specific performance of contract 
instituted by respondent No.3 against Munsaf Khan, inter alia, on the 
ground that Munsaf Khan got married with the deceased Khursheed 
Sherwani but the said marital knot had been dissolved when the latter 
was divorced by the former in the year 1980. Therefore, Munsaf Khan 
was not entitled to any share/claim, in the house, as legal heir of the 
deceased Khursheed Sherwani. In support of their contentions, the 
petitioners relied upon the suit for declaration titled “Munsaf Khan v. 
Public at large etc.”, instituted by Munsaf Khan in the Civil Court, 
Sialkot, on 30.07.2010, in which Munsaf Khan claimed himself as 
widower of the deceased Khursheed Sherwani and also arrayed 
mother of the petitioners namely, Mumtaz Begum along with another 
sibling and nieces of the deceased Khursheed Sherwani, as legal heirs 
of the latter, and sought declaration in respect of the house. The 
petitioners along with others contested the claim of Munsaf Khan with 
the averments that he had divorced the deceased Khursheed Sherwani. 
Issues were framed and the said suit was dismissed with costs, vide 
judgment and decree dated 28.03.2013, under Order XVII, Rule 3 of 
the CPC, as Munsaf Khan was unable to lead any evidence regarding 
subsistence of his marriage with the deceased Khursheed Sherwani, 
till her death and the said judgment and decree dated 28.03.2013 
attained finality as the same was not assailed at any higher forum by 
Munsaf Khan. Reply to the application under Section 12(2) of the 
CPC, filed by the petitioners, was obtained by the learned Trial Court. 
Only respondent No.3 contested the application by filing reply 

 
 
 
3 
W.P No.3264/2020 
whereas Munsaf Khan, once again, opted not to appear before the 
learned Trial Court. Respondent No.3, in his reply, pleaded to be 
bonafide purchaser of the suit property. Having framed the issues and 
recorded the evidence, the learned Trial Court dismissed application 
of the petitioners, vide order dated 13.05.2019 and the revision 
petition filed by the petitioners against the said order had also been 
dismissed, vide order and decree dated 26.10.2019. The concurrent 
findings of the learned Courts below have been assailed through the 
present constitutional petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that both the 
learned Courts below have erred in appreciating the fact that there was 
no valid declaration in favour of Munsaf Khan regarding his right to 
inherit 1/2 share of the house that constitutes the suit property. Adds 
that since Munsaf Khan had no title to the suit property, he could not 
transfer a better title to respondent No.3. Further contends that even if 
respondent No.3 is a bonafide purchaser, he can only lay claim for 
recovery of the sale price, if any, paid by him to Munsaf Khan.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.3 submits that 
respondent No.3 is a bonafide purchaser, of the suit property, who 
dealt with Munsaf Khan on the strength of the nikahnama as well as 
the death certificate of Khursheed Sherwani inasmuch as the latter 
document clearly reflects the name of Munsaf Khan as husband of the 
deceased Khursheed Sherwani and the said certificate was never 
challenged by the petitioners. Whereas Munsaf Khan expired during 
these proceedings and resultantly, his legal heirs were arrayed as 
respondents No.2-A to 2-C, however, despite service, they too opted 
not to appear before this Court and were proceeded ex-parte, vide 
order dated 08.03.2023.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
The present case, revolving around the property left by the 
deceased Khursheed Sherwani, with the above referred factual matrix, 
necessitates the determination of the following questions: 

 
 
 
4 
W.P No.3264/2020 
(i) 
Whether respondent No.3 carried out due diligence 
regarding the title of the house so as to justify his claim of 
being a bonafide purchaser of the suit property? 
(ii)  Whether respondent No.3 was justified in treating the 
death certificate of the deceased Khursheed Sherwani, 
depicting name of Munsaf Khan as her husband, to be 
sufficient evidence conferring title of the suit property 
upon Munsaf Khan? 
7. 
Before rendering an opinion on the above stated points of 
determination, it is apt to note that this Court is fully cognizant of the 
well settled legal position that by operation of law a Muslim‟s estate 
legally and juridically vests immediately on his death in his or her 
heirs and their rights respectively come into existence forthwith. In 
this regard, case cited as “Ghulam Ali and 2 others v. Mst. Ghulam 
Sarwar Naqvi” (PLD 1990 SC 1) is referred. Thus, the right of legal 
heirs to the estate of a deceased comes into being immediately on the 
death of propositus and the same does not hinge upon any overt or 
covert act to be performed. The legal position that the estate of 
deceased immediately vests in the legal heirs on the death of the 
deceased is an ineluctable position, but the fact as to whether a 
particular person is a legal heir or not is required to be determined and 
declared by a Court of competent jurisdiction, particularly when the 
status of the legal heir as such is disputed. Once the Court makes such 
declaration in favour of the legal heirs, their names can be added as 
the title holder in the relevant record maintained by the regulatory 
authorities such as the Revenue, Excise or Settlement Departments, 
etc. In order to obtain such declaratory decree, the legal heirs have to 
prove before the Court that they are the only legal heirs of the 
propositus. 
8. 
Having the above analysis regarding legal position pertaining to 
the rights of legal heirs of a deceased (in present case, Khursheed 
Sherwani) in sight, the evidentiary resume and factual matrix of the 
case needs to be analyzed. This Court finds that admittedly after the 
death of Khursheed Sherwani, Munsaf Khan approached the learned 

 
 
 
5 
W.P No.3264/2020 
Civil Court, Sialkot, by instituting the suit, seeking declaration of his 
rights as legal heir of the deceased Khursheed Sherwani and was 
unsuccessful when the petitioners contested his claim with averments 
that Munsaf Khan had divorced the said deceased before the latter 
expired. The suit was dismissed with costs, vide judgment and decree 
dated 28.03.2013, under Order XVII, Rule 3 of the CPC for want of 
evidence and the said decree has not been further challenged and still 
holds the field. Moreover, relevant record related to the house 
maintained by the Registering Authorities such as Excise and 
Taxation Office was not amended in favour of Munsaf Khan, to 
confer any title upon him. In the presence of the decree dated 
28.03.2013, holding the field, whereby the suit of Munsaf Khan was 
dismissed, he had no title in respect of the suit property and hence, 
was not empowered to alienate the same in favour of anyone, 
including respondent No.3. It is settled principle of law that a person 
cannot transfer a better title than he himself has as envisaged in terms 
of the latin maxim ‘Nemo dat quod non-habet („no one can give what 
they do not have). Therefore, on this ground alone the agreement fails 
and the learned Courts below have misread the evidence and ignored 
the judgment and decree dated 28.03.2013 and relied upon death 
certificate of the deceased Khursheed Sherwani, hence, erred in law 
and fact while dismissing the application of the petitioners, under 
Section 12(2) of the CPC, as a death certificate or a nikahnama cannot 
be considered as documents conferring title of the house.  
9. 
Adverting to question whether respondent No.3 is entitled to 
seek protection of bonafide purchaser for value, suffice to observe that 
one of the essential components of defence of bonafide purchaser is to 
establish that there was no dishonesty of purpose or tainted intention 
to enter into the transaction. In addition, it is also required to be 
established that due diligence as to the title was carried out prior to 
purchase of the property in question. Case reported as “Hafiz 

 
 
 
6 
W.P No.3264/2020 
Tassaduq Hussain v. Lal Khatoon and others” (PLD 2011 SC 296) is 
referred in this regard.  
10. 
The plea of respondent No.3 as bonafide purchaser is devoid of 
any persuasive force on the ground that his vendor (Munsaf Khan) 
had no title to the house as examined and held in the preceding 
paragraphs. What adds to it is that respondent No. 3 failed to establish 
the absence of dishonesty of purposes and tainted intention, which is 
evident form the fact that the contents and recitals of the agreement 
between Munsaf Khan and respondent No.3 reveal that Munsaf Khan 
claimed exclusive ownership of the house left by the deceased 
Khursheed Sherwani and respondent No.3 relied on the same on the 
strength of an entry in death certificate of Khursheed Sherwani. It 
belies logic that respondent No.3 by, merely, examining the death 
certificate and nikahnama of the deceased Khursheed Sherwani and 
Munsaf Khan reached the conclusion or had drawn an inference that 
the former died issueless and Munsaf Khan has 1/2 (half) share in the 
house left by the deceased Khursheed Sherwani, without making a 
necessary probe as required under Section 41 of the Transfer of 
Property Act, 1882 (“the Act”) as to who are the legal heirs having 
claim to the remaining 1/2 (half) share in the house more so when it is 
his claim that he was put in possession of 1/2 (half) share of the house 
by Munsaf Khan, upon receipt of entire sale price by the latter, when 
the agreement was executed. Therefore, even if respondent No.3, in 
good faith, believed that Munsaf Khan was entitled to 1/2 (half) share 
in the house left by the deceased Khursheed Sherwani, there is no 
explanation why the recitals of the agreement contemplates to the 
effect that Munsaf Khan is the exclusive owner of the house. 
Admittedly, the petitioners were in possession of the house. Had 
respondent No.3 acted with honest and bona fide motivation and 
genuinely been put in possession of undivided part of the house, 
constituting suit property as alleged in the agreement, he would have 
easily got knowledge of the defect in title of Munsaf Khan. The stance 

 
 
 
7 
W.P No.3264/2020 
of respondent No.3 is otherwise so contradictory and capricious as to 
be on two diagonally opposite directions and positions. On the one 
hand, it has been narrated in the agreement that the possession was 
handed over to respondent No. 3 by Munsaf Khan at the time of 
execution of the agreement; and on the other hand, the execution was 
filed and the possession was obtained through the intervention of the 
bailiff, at the direction of the learned Executing Court. Such 
contradictory stance of respondent No.3 alone blow up the bona fides 
of respondent No.3 given the fact that during the cross examination, 
specific suggestion was put to AW/1 in the following manner: 
 
’’

The suggestion depicts that the possession was taken through bailiff 
during the execution of the decree and also exhibits the contradiction 
in stance of respondent No.3 in relation to possession of the house as 
analyzed above. Therefore, this Court is of the view that it clearly 
borne out from the judicial record that respondent No. 3 was not in 
possession of the 1/2 (half) of the house at the time of filing of the suit 
for specific performance and obtained the possession only through 
bailiff appointed by the learned Executing Court, once ex-parte decree 
was passed in favour of respondent No.3 against Munsaf Khan, whose 
address given in the suit for specific performance was that of Khushab 
and not Sialkot, where the house is situated that further shows that 
Munsaf Khan was not even in possession of the remaining 1/2 (half)  
of the house, which he purportedly had not sold after claiming to be 
the exclusive owner of the house as per the agreement. It also belies 
logic that respondent No.3 paid entire sale price to Munsaf Khan 
under the agreement and neither got the sale deed registered nor got 
the possession of the suit property forming part of the house, through 

 
 
 
8 
W.P No.3264/2020 
proper partition or settlement with the co-sharers, whereas the 
agreement narrates that possession of the house was obtained at the 
time of the execution of the agreement, which is refuted by the record 
as discussed hereinabove.  
11. 
The above referred analysis leads to ineluctable inference that 
had respondent No.3 conducted a probe into the status of the house, as 
part of due diligence required by a buyer of an immovable property 
before purchasing the same in good faith, he should have inquired 
about the status of the occupants of the same i.e., the petitioners, 
which could have easily revealed to him about the dispute between 
Munsaf Khan and the petitioners and other successors-in-interest of 
the deceased Khursheed Sherwani; the filing of suit for declaration by 
the former; and its dismissal, vide judgment and decree dated 
28.03.2013. There is also no explanation why Munsaf Khan was not 
asked to provide a declaratory decree in his favour in respect of his 
share in the house, to respondent No.3, establishing the entitlement 
thereof before paying the entire sale price and obtaining possession of 
the suit property. So even if it is assumed that the agreement was 
executed with bona fides, the only reason why the execution of the 
sale deed was postponed despite purportedly paying the entire sale 
price appears to be absence of a clear title in favour of Munsaf Khan. 
When confronted with a pointed question by this Court in this regard, 
there was no plausible explanation available with learned counsel for 
respondent No.3. It is hard to disagree that the contents of a death 
certificate cannot be treated as an instrument, under the law, 
conferring entitlement of share in the house as analyzed hereinabove. 
The above discussion leads to the conclusion that respondent No.3 
cannot seek protection of being bonafide purchaser as he failed to take 
appropriate steps as was required under Section 41 of the Act to 
satisfy himself in relation to the entitlement of Munsaf Khan to the 
suit property, as legal heir of the deceased Khursheed Sherwani. Cases 
reported as “Abdul Hameed through L.Rs and others v. Shamsuddin 

 
 
 
9 
W.P No.3264/2020 
and others” (PLD 2008 SC 140) and “Mosam Khan v. Sarfraz Khan 
through L.Rs and others” (2012 CLC 1944) are referred in this 
regard. 
12.  
There is yet another aspect of the matter. Admittedly, the suit 
property forms undivided part of the house, measuring 05 Marlas. 
There was no description as to which part of the house was sold by 
Munsaf Khan to respondent No.3 and possession thereof was 
purportedly given at the time of execution of the agreement although 
respondent No.3 could not prove such possession to have been 
delivered at the time of the execution of the agreement. The law in 
this regard is settled to the effect that an undivided share of a co-
sharer can be a subject matter of sale/transfer, but the possession 
cannot be handed over to the vendee unless the property is partitioned 
by metes and bounds, either by the decree of a Court in a partition 
suit, or by settlement among the co-sharers. Therefore, even if Munsaf 
Khan had a valid title (which he had not as examined hereinabove), 
respondent No.3 could have been entitled only for „symbolic 
possession‟ and thereafter, he should have approached the Court of 
competent jurisdiction for partition of the joint property as per law, 
which has not been done. This also shows that the ex-parte decree, on 
the basis of the agreement, was obtained through fraud and the same 
was got executed with dishonest intention. Therefore, this Court is of 
the opinion that respondent No.3 failed to establish absence of 
dishonesty of purpose or tainted intention while entering into the 
agreement that is sine qua non to seek protection of bonafide 
purchaser in terms of Section 41 of the Act. Both the learned Courts 
below have erred by not appreciating the matter in its proper 
perspective and merely non-suited the petitioners on the ground that 
they could not prove divorce between Munsaf Khan and the deceased 
Khursheed Sherwani, which was otherwise not relevant when it was 
clearly borne from the judicial record, having sanctity attached to it, 
that Munsaf Khan‟s suit for declaration as legal heir of the deceased 

 
 
 
10 
W.P No.3264/2020 
Khursheed Sherwani was dismissed for want of evidence and the said 
judgment and decree dated 28.03.2013 still holds the field that cannot 
be brushed aside and death certificate of the deceased Khursheed 
Sherwani and her nikahnama with Munsaf Khan cannot be preferred 
over the said judgment and decree.  
13. 
In view of the above, the present petition is allowed. The 
judgments of the learned Courts below are set aside and the 
application filed by the petitioners under Section 12(2) of the CPC is 
accepted. As a natural corollary, ex-parte judgment and decree dated 
19.12.2013 passed in favour of respondent No.3 is also set aside and 
the suit of respondent No.3 for specific performance shall be deemed 
to be pending that shall be decided afresh after impleading the 
petitioners as necessary party. No order as to costs.
