Date of hearing: 
 02.12.2025. 
Appellants by: 
Mr. Khalid Ashraf Khan, Advocate.  
 
Respondents No.2 to 9: M/s Rana M. Javed Iqbal, Imran 
Baig, Rao Ayub Gohar, Muhammad 
Sajid Iqbal Chaudhry and Usama 
Bahadur Advocates.  
 
Respondent No.10 by: 
Mr. Kashif Nadeem, Advocate.  
 
AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J. Through this appeal, the 
appellants have called into question the validity and legality of 
judgment dated 25.10.2023 passed by learned District Judge, Multan, 
pursuant whereto their application under Section 29 of the Mental 
Health Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance No.VIII of 2001), for 
appointment of guardian of their father/respondent No.2 Mian 
Muhammad Akbar was dismissed.  
2. 
Tersely, the facts forming background of the instant appeal are 
that the appellants filed an application under Section 29 of the 
Mental Health Ordinance, 2001 (The Ordinance, 2001) for their 

F.A.O. No.117 of 2023. 
2
appointment as guardian of their father/respondent No.2 namely 
Mian Muhammad Akbar by taking prior permission from the 
Advocate General Punjab. They averred that respondent No.2 is a 
well-off person having large number of properties and living with his 
wife and sons. They maintained that their father is mentally and 
physically unfit and suffering from old Isheamic Stroke Caretied 
Stenosuis (Left I.C.A) Stage I, Parkinsons’s Disease and Dementia, 
Comorbids of Hypertension and some other diseases, and by taking 
benefit of his disability their brothers are taking undue benefits from 
the property of their father. They maintained that they be appointed 
as guardian of respondent No.2 for the following reasons:- 
i. To take proper care of the father (Mian Muhammad Akbar), 
who is mentally ill. 
ii. To prevent him (Mian Muhammad Akbar) from causing injury 
himself or to others.  
iii. To bring back the mentally ill person (Mian Muhammad Akbar) 
to the said facility on the expiry of the period of leave. 
iv. To save the holdings of the person (Mian Muhammad Akbar). 
3. 
Respondents contested the application by filing written 
statement/written reply. Learned District Judge, Multan, after 
examining the respondent No.2 and hearing both sides dismissed the 
application being not maintainable vide judgment dated 25.10.2023. 
Feeling aggrieved, the appellants have filed instant appeal.  
4. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and gone 
through the record with their able assistance.  
5. 
After hearing learned counsel for the parties and going 
through the record, it has been observed that the appellants filed 
application under Section 29 of the Ordinance, 2001, for their 

F.A.O. No.117 of 2023. 
3
appointment as guardian of respondent No.2 namely Mian 
Muhammad Akbar Dhareja who happens to be their father. The 
reason assigned by the appellants for appointment is that their father 
is suffering from old Isheamic Stroke Caretied Stenosuis (Left I.C.A) 
Stage I, Parkinsons’s Disease and Dementia, Comorbids of 
Hypertension and some other diseases. They maintained that by 
taking benefit of the disability of their father, their brothers are 
taking undue benefits from the property of their father.  
6. 
Section 29 of the Mental Health Ordinance, 2001, provides a 
mechanism for judicial intervention when a person who owns or 
controls property is alleged to be mentally disordered. Under this 
provision, a relative of the person may apply to the designated Court 
of Protection in the area of the person’s residence, seeking an inquiry 
into the person’s mental capacity. The application must be 
accompanied by the written consent of the relevant Advocate 
General of the Province, ensuring a safeguard against frivolous or 
malicious petitions. Upon receiving the application, the court 
conducts an inquiry to determine whether the individual is indeed 
mentally disordered and incapable of managing themselves, their 
property, or their affairs. If the court concludes that the person lacks 
such capacity, it may take necessary measures under the Ordinance, 
including the appointment of a guardian for personal care and a 
property manager to oversee the individual’s estate. The provision is 
intended to protect mentally disordered persons from exploitation, 
neglect, or mismanagement, while ensuring that their rights are 

F.A.O. No.117 of 2023. 
4
safeguarded through a fair and transparent judicial process. Section 
29 of the Ordinance, is reproduced as under:- 
29.Judicial proceedings.— Whenever any person is possessed of 
property and is alleged to be mentally disordered, the Court of 
Protection, within whose jurisdiction such person is residing may, 
upon application by any of his relatives having obtained consent 
in writing of the Advocate General Punjab by order direct an 
inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining whether such person is 
mentally disordered and incapable of managing himself, his 
property and his affairs. 
 
7. 
Section 30(1)(d) of the Ordinance, 2001, provides that the 
Court may require the alleged mentally disordered person to attend, 
at such convenient time and place as it may appoint for the purpose 
of being personally examined by the Court, or to any person from 
whom the Court may desire to have a report of the mental capacity 
and condition of such mentally disordered person. For facility of 
reference, Section 30(1)(d) is reproduced hereunder: 
"30. Regulation of proceedings of the Court of Protection.— 
(1) The following provisions shall regulate the proceedings of 
the Court of Protection with regard to the matter to which they 
relate, namely:- 
(a) Notice shall be given to the mentally disordered person of the time 
and place at which it is proposed to hold the inquiry;  
(b) if it appears that personal service on the alleged mentally 
disordered person would be ineffectual, the Court may direct such 
substituted service of notice as it thinks fit;  
(c) the Court may also direct copy of such notice to be served upon 
any relative of the alleged mentally disordered person and upon any 
other person to whom in the opinion of the Court notice of the 
application should be given;  
(d) the Court may require the alleged mentally disordered person to 
attend, at such convenient time and place as it may appoint for the 
purpose of being personally examined by the Court, or to any person 
from whom the Court may desire to have a report of the mental 
capacity and condition of such mentally disordered person;" 
 
8. 
It is matter of record that the application was earlier filed 
before the District Judge, D.G. Khan. In order to satisfy the 

F.A.O. No.117 of 2023. 
5
requirement of Section 30(1)(d) ibid, District Judge, D.G. Khan, 
summoned the respondent No.2 on 11.10.2021 and after 
interviewing him observed as under: 
"Respondent No.2 Mian Muhammad Akbar while appearing in the 
Court has given intelligent answers to the questions put to him." 
 
9. 
Subsequently, while accepting the Transfer Application filed 
by the appellants before this Court, vide order dated 12.06.2023 
matter was entrusted to District Judge, Multan, for decision of the 
application. He also summoned and examined respondent No.2 on 
05.10.2023 and observed that respondent No.2 is well oriented, well 
dress and well behaved and apparently no mental disability and 
ailment in his person and personality was noticed. Relevant portion 
of order dated 05.10.2023 is reproduced as under:-  
"Mian Muhammad Akbar Dhareja (respondent No.2) stated that 
his name is Mian Muhammad Akbar Dhareja and he is 75 years 
old. His father's name is Mian Ghulam Hussain Dhareja, name of 
his wife is Safia and she is his only wife. Out of his wedlock he has 
at present two sons and four daughters. His one son Mian 
Muhammad Waseem died some years ago, his another son 
Muhammad Yousaf was a banker and now he is helping him in 
agricultural affairs/business and other son Mian Muhammad 
Faheem is a government servant and is serving in Intelligence 
Bureau whereas his four are daughters namely Mst. Naghma, Mst. 
Asma, Mst. Gull Fareen and Mst. Najma. He recognized/identified 
his two daughters Naghma and Gul Fareen present in the court. 
He stated that he is M.A LL.B. General appearance of respondent 
No.2 Mian Muhammad Akbar Dhareja is observed/noticed as 
being well oriented, well dressed and well behaved while 
appearing before this court and responded to all the questions put 
to him by this court normally/comfortably and politely. It was also 

F.A.O. No.117 of 2023. 
6
observed that respondent No.2 entered and left the court room on 
foot with normal walk though with slight help." 
10. 
During the pendency of this appeal, this Court also summoned 
respondent No.2 who appeared in the Court on 27.10.2025. This 
Court examined the respondent No.2 and passed the following order: 
"In compliance with the previous order, respondent No.2 is 
present before the Court in person. He has been examined at some 
length and has responded to all the questions put to him by the 
Court in an intelligent and satisfactory manner. There is a written 
request for adjournment on behalf of the learned counsel for the 
appellants; therefore, the case cannot proceed today. One last 
opportunity is granted to the learned counsel for the appellants to 
argue the case, failing which the interim relief already granted 
shall stand vacated automatically." 
11. 
Today, two connected Civil Revisions filed by the appellants 
are also pending this Court which are being decided through separate 
judgments. Proposition involved in those Civil Revisions is that the 
appellants challenged the gift mutations executed by their 
father/respondent No.2 in favour of his sons etc. Even in those suits, 
respondent No.2 appeared before the Court on two different dates 
and acknowledged the valid execution of the mutations, upon which 
the plaints of the suits were rejected under Order VII Rule 11 C.P.C. 
12. 
The entire edifice of the appellants’ case rests on the assertion 
that respondent No.2 is mentally disordered and incapable of 
managing his affairs. However, this assertion stands completely 
demolished by the unimpeached judicial observations recorded by 
three different Courts at three different stages: first by the learned 
District Judge, D.G. Khan on 11.10.2021, thereafter by the learned 
District Judge, Multan on 05.10.2023, and finally by this Court on 

F.A.O. No.117 of 2023. 
7
27.10.2025. On each occasion, respondent No.2 appeared in person, 
responded coherently, gave intelligent answers, demonstrated 
complete awareness of his personal, familial and financial affairs, 
and exhibited no sign whatsoever of mental incapacity. It is settled 
law that when the alleged mentally disordered person himself 
appears before the Court and is found to be mentally sound upon 
judicial examination, no further inquiry survives, nor can medical 
certificates produced by adversarial parties override the Court’s 
direct assessment made under Section 30(1)(d) of the Ordinance, 
2001. 
13. 
The appellants’ conduct also creates serious doubt about the 
bona fides of their claim. They not only failed to rebut the repeated 
judicial observations regarding their father’s mental soundness, but 
also simultaneously pursued civil litigation seeking cancellation of 
gift mutations executed by respondent No.2. In those independent 
proceedings as well, respondent No.2 appeared twice before the civil 
court and affirmed the valid execution of the impugned mutations. 
The appellants thus seek, through the Mental Health Ordinance, 
2001, a remedy which is plainly collateral to their property disputes.  
14. 
During the course of arguments, learned counsel for the 
appellants emphasized that the appellants filed the application after 
obtaining the consent of the Advocate General, as specifically 
mandated under Section 29 of the Mental Health Ordinance, 2001. 
He added that the Advocate General, after examining the application, 
forwarded it to the Court, thereby fulfilling the statutory precondition. 

F.A.O. No.117 of 2023.

Learned counsel argued that in these circumstances, the learned 
District Judge was not justified in dismissing the application on the 
ground that it was not maintainable. In this regard, it has been 
observed that the grant or refusal of consent by the Advocate 
General is not a judicial determination; rather, it constitutes a 
procedural formality designed to prevent frivolous, vexatious, or 
malicious applications from reaching the Court. The role of the 
Advocate General is limited to conducting a preliminary review and 
determining whether there is a prima facie case that warrants the 
Court’s attention, but he has no authority to adjudicate substantive 
questions concerning the individual’s mental capacity or property 
management. All critical issues, including the appointment of a 
guardian for the person and a manager for the property of a mentally 
disordered person, are to be examined and decided exclusively by 
the Court before which the application is filed. The Court is required 
to consider medical reports, evidence from the parties, and other 
relevant circumstances to determine whether the person is indeed 
mentally disordered and incapable of managing their affairs. The 
ultimate decision regarding the guardianship of the person and the 
management of their property rests solely with the Court. The 
Advocate General’s role is limited to providing statutory clearance 
for the petition to be entertained. Consequently, the dismissal of an 
application on the ground of maintainability, despite compliance 
with the requirement of consent under Section 29, undermines the 
substantive objectives of the Ordinance, which aim to protect 

F.A.O. No.117 of 2023. 
9
mentally disordered persons and ensure that their personal and 
property interests are legally safeguarded. 
15. 
Learned counsel also agitated that the District Judge should 
have referred the matter for constitution of a Medical Board for 
medical examination of respondent No.2 in order to ascertain 
whether he is of sound mind or otherwise. In this regard, suffice is to 
observe that when the Court itself examined the respondent No.2 in 
person on different occasions and found no clue or gesture indicating 
mental unsoundness, then there was no need to refer respondent No.2 
to the medical board.   
16. 
The Mental Health Ordinance, 2001 is a beneficial and 
welfare-oriented statute, designed with the singular purpose of 
safeguarding the rights, dignity, and well-being of individuals who 
are genuinely suffering from mental disorders. It seeks to ensure that 
such vulnerable persons are treated with compassion, protected from 
exploitation, and provided with necessary care through lawful 
supervision where required. The protective framework of the 
Ordinance cannot be stretched, distorted, or weaponized to advance 
ulterior motives or settle intra-family property disputes. Courts have 
consistently held that proceedings under mental health laws must not 
be invoked lightly or for collateral objectives, as doing so 
undermines the very spirit and sanctity of the legislation. 
Guardianship under this Ordinance is not a tool to gain control over 
the property of a competent adult, nor does it serve as an alternate 
forum for contesting civil rights already determined or disputed 

F.A.O. No.117 of 2023. 
10
elsewhere. When the alleged mentally disordered person appears 
before the Court, responds intelligently, and demonstrates full 
command over his personal and financial affairs, the law does not 
permit the misuse of mental health jurisdiction to circumvent valid 
transactions. The Ordinance demands strict scrutiny of mala fide 
intent, for the dignity of a mentally sound person must not be 
compromised merely to serve the financial ambitions of another. 
Any attempt to mould this protective statute into a strategic 
instrument for achieving property-driven objectives is not only 
legally impermissible but morally reprehensible. The Courts are 
therefore duty-bound to prevent such abuse and preserve the 
beneficial character of the law. 
17. 
Undeniably, respondent No.2 is a man of means, possessing 
substantial holdings and resources, yet it is deeply distressing that his 
own children, instead of showing gratitude and respect, have chosen 
to question his mental competence. An elderly man has been 
compelled to defend his dignity, sanity, and autonomy in the courts 
because his own flesh and blood have chosen vengeance over filial 
duty.  
18. 
Islam commands respect and care for parents, as narrated in 
the Holy Quran, Surah Al-Israel (17:23–24): 
"For your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And 
honour your parents. If one or both of them reach old age in your 
care, never say to them ˹even˺ ‘ugh,’ nor yell at them. Rather, 
address them respectfully. And be humble with them out of mercy, 
and pray, “My Lord! Be merciful to them as they raised me when 
I was young"

19. 
Yet, the appellants’ actions starkly violate this divine 
injunction. The appellants’ actions reflect not only a moral failing 
but a stark misuse of the protective provisions of the Mental Health 
Ordinance, which were designed to safeguard those truly vulnerable, 
not to be weaponized against a competent and loving father.  
20. 
Viewed in totality, the impugned judgment dated 25.10.2023 
handed down by the learned District Judge is not only legally sound 
but eminently well-reasoned. It rests on proper appreciation of the 
statutory scheme, correct application of Section 30(1)(d) of the 
Ordinance, 2001, careful evaluation of the parties’ conduct, and 
direct judicial assessment of respondent No.2’s mental state. The 
appellants have utterly failed to point out any misreading, non-
reading, perversity, jurisdictional defect or legal infirmity warranting 
interference in appellate jurisdiction. 
21. 
Although learned counsel for the appellants argued the matter 
with vehemence and placed reliance upon a number of precedents, 
yet in view of the distinct and peculiar facts of the present case, the 

F.A.O. No.117 of 2023. 
12
cited authorities are clearly distinguishable and do not advance the 
appellants’ case in any manner. 
22. 
As an inevitable corollary of above discussion, this appeal, 
being devoid of merit and motivated by collateral considerations, is 
accordingly dismissed.
