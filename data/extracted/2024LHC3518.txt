Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:–Through this single 
judgment, I intend to decide the titled appeal as well as 
regular first appeal No. 63163 of 2020, being outcome 
of same judgment and decree dated 22.09.2020 passed 
by the learned Additional District Judge, Lahore. 
Hereinafter, Muhammad Altaf shall be called as the 
‘Appellant’ and Rana Muhammad Shakeel shall be 
called as the ‘Respondent’.

Brief facts of the case are that on 24.05.2016

the Respondent instituted suit for recovery of 
Rs.15,00,000/- (the ‘suit’), under Order XXXVII of the 
Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (the ‘Code’), with the 
averments that the Appellant and his partner namely Ali 
Adnan (the ‘principal-debtor’) being importer of 
Japanese cars offered the Respondent to purchase a 
Honda Vezel 1500-CC, model 2010 (the ‘vehicle’) for 
which initially an agreement dated 11.10.2014 (the 
‘first agreement’) was executed and the Appellant 
stood surety to the extent of Rs. 15,00,000-; that the 
Appellant also placed his thumb impressions and signed 
the first agreement with a note that he stood guarantor 
on behalf of principal-debtor and issued a cheque No. 
131052122 dated 11.10.2014, the Bank of Punjab, for 
an amount of Rs.15,00,000/- (the ‘cheque’); that 
Rs.22,50,000/- were paid as consideration of the 
vehicle. It is further pleaded in the suit that the 
principal-debtor failed to fulfill the terms of the first 
agreement or deliver the vehicle within the stipulated 
time period, upon which another agreement dated 
16.12.2014 (the ‘second agreement’) was executed, 
which was again signed by the Appellant and as per the 
terms of the said agreement another amount of 
Rs.7,50,000/- was received by the Respondent; that 
despite receiving the entire amount the vehicle could 
not be delivered. The Respondent filed the suit upon 
dishonouring of the cheque on its presentation before 
relevant branch of the bank. The learned trial Court 
allowed the Respondent to defend the case and 
accordingly he filed his written statement. Out of 
divergent pleadings, the following issues were framed:- 
1.  Whether plaintiff is entitled for the decree 
and recovery of Rs.15,00,000/- on the basis of 

 
(1) R.F.A. No. 676 of 2021 
(2) R.F.A. No.63163-2020 
 
 
3 
dishonour cheque No. 131052122 or not? 
OPP 
2. Whether 
the 
agreement 
No.740 
dated 
11.10.2014 and agreement No.1120 dated 
16.12.2014 were executed in favour of 
plaintiff on behalf of Ali Adnan with regard to 
the give and take of sale amount of vehicle in 
presence of witnesses or not? OPP 
3. Whether plaintiff has come to the court with 
unclean hands and suit is barred by law not 
maintainable after obtaining decree against 
Ali Adnan for same amount in dispute from 
competent court of law? OPD 
4. Whether the suit is liable to be dismissed due 
to mis-joinder and non- joinder of parties and 
based on mala fide intention to blackmail and 
harass the defendant? OPD 
5. Relief. 
 
 
 
 
3.  
After framing of issues, the parties produced 
their respective evidence. The learned trial Court gave 
issue-wise findings and granted the following relief to 
the Respondent, vide judgment and decree dated 
22.09.2020: - 
“..In view of my findings on issue No.1, 
the suit of the plaintiff is decreed with 
costs. The plaintiff is held entitled to 
recover 
principal 
amount 
of 
Rs.15,00,000/- 
from 
the 
defendant. 
Decree sheet be drawn accordingly…” 
 
 
Being aggrieved from the above both sides 
have filed their appeals. 
4.  
Malik Shahid Iqbal Babbar, learned counsel 
for the Appellant, has submitted that the Appellant has 
issued the cheque merely as a surety and the valid legal 
course for the Respondent was to get the liability of the 
principal-debtor to be first adjudged and only then the 
suit against the Appellant could have been filed. He has 
further submitted that the principal-debtor even 

 
(1) R.F.A. No. 676 of 2021 
(2) R.F.A. No.63163-2020 
 
 
4 
otherwise, was a necessary party and in his absence no 
relief could be granted to the Respondent, which is 
ignored by the learned trial Court.  
5.  
Conversely, Mr. Haroon Mehboob Butt, 
learned counsel for the Respondent has opposed the 
above argument and he has stated that the Appellant has 
clearly undertaken the liability as well as issued an 
independent instrument i.e. the cheque, requiring no 
liability to be adjudged against any other person; that 
the cheque being negotiable instrument carries 
presumption 
as 
to 
its 
correctness 
and 
valid 
consideration under section 118 of the Negotiable 
Instruments Act, 1881 (‘N.I.A., 1881’). He has added 
that the Respondent is entitled to interest in view of 
sections 79 and 80 of N.I.A., 1881. 
6.  
I have heard the arguments of the learned 
counsel for the parties and perused the record with their 
able assistance. 
7.  
The first agreement is on record as Ex.P-1. 
The second page (backside of the stamp paper) contains 
a note / Ex. P-2 (the ‘Note’), comprising of following 
term(s):- 
”ںیم دمحم ااطلف ودل رونباز انشیتخ اکرڈ ربمن5

Beneath the Note, the signatures as well as 
thumb impressions of the Appellant are available. It is 
significant that the first agreement and execution of the 

 
(1) R.F.A. No. 676 of 2021 
(2) R.F.A. No.63163-2020 
 
 
5 
Note are not denied. The principal-debtor has also 
placed his thumb impressions and signatures on the 
Note.  
8. 
From the reading of the Note it is evident that 
the Appellant has undertaken to pay Rs.15,00,000/- and 
he acknowledged issuance of the cheque. In his written 
statement (paragraphs No. 1 and 3, on merits) the 
Appellant has again admitted issuing of the cheque in 
favour of the Respondent, however, denied being 
partner of the principal-debtor and adopted the stance 
that he is just a surety. To wriggle out of the liability 
undertaken by the Appellant, it is much emphasized by 
the learned counsel for the Appellant that it is inevitable 
to first get the liability adjudged against the principal-
debtor or have him in the array of parties as a 
defendant.   
9.  
Section 128 of the Contract Act, 1872 (the 
‘Contract Act’) provides that the liability of the surety 
is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor, unless 
it is otherwise provided by the contract. The Note 
reflects 
that 
the 
Appellant 
undertook 
to 
pay 
Rs.15,00,000/-, apparently without requirement of any 
reference to the principal-debtor. There is nothing on 
record suggesting that anything contrary was settled 
between the parties. In case titled “Sukur Pradhan and 
others v. Orissa State Financial Corporation and 
others” (AIR 1992 ORISSA 281) the Court after 
referring the entire case law from 1917 to 1992, reached 
to the conclusion that surety can be held liable to 
creditor irrespective of remedy which the creditor may 
have against principal-debtor and the creditor can 
proceed against the surety without exhausting his 

 
(1) R.F.A. No. 676 of 2021 
(2) R.F.A. No.63163-2020 
 
 
6 
remedy against the principal-debtor. The general law as 
also stated in section 128 of the Contract Act is subject 
to the stipulations of the contract and if anything 
different is provided in the contract then the same is to 
be given effect. Same conclusion was drawn by the 
Supreme Court of India in case titled “The Bank of 
Bihar Ltd. v. Dr. Damodar Prasad and another” (AIR 
1969 Supreme Court 297). 
10.  
In cases titled “Pakistan Industrial Credit and 
Investment Corporation Ltd., Karachi versus Fazal 
Vanaspati Limited, Karachi” (PLD 1993 Karachi 90) 
and “National Bank of Pakistan versus F. S. 
Aitzazuddin and 2 others” (PLD 1982 Karachi 577), 
the Sindh High Court, facing the situation as in present 
case, made reference to section 137 of the Contract Act, 
which provides that mere forbearance on the part of the 
creditor to sue the principal debtor or to enforce any 
other remedy against him does not, in the absence of 
any provision in the guarantee to the contrary, 
discharge the surety. It has been gathered by the 
learned Sindh High Court that a creditor cannot be 
compelled to first exhaust his remedy against a 
principal-debtor, when the contract does not provide 
anything contrary and mere forbearance to assert claim 
or pursue remedy against principal debtor, cannot 
discharge the surety. It will be beneficial to reproduce 
the following extract of National Bank of Pakistan case 
(supra): - 
“…The 
liability 
of 
the 
surety 
arises 
immediately on the failure of the principal 
debtor and unless otherwise provided in the 
Contract a creditor cannot be compelled to 
first exhaust his remedy against the principal 
debtor before initiating any action against the 

 
(1) R.F.A. No. 676 of 2021 
(2) R.F.A. No.63163-2020 
 
 
7 
surety. The liabilities of the principal debtor 
and the surety are separate and distinct. Even 
in cases where the liabilities of both the 
parties arise from the same transaction of the 
same document, the liabilities are distinct. 
Reference can be made to the case PLD 1975 
Kar. 504. The surely is liable under his 
contract which he executes in favour of the 
creditor. In terms of the letter of guarantee 
the defendants have agreed that their liability 
to the plaintiff shall be that of principal 
debtor and at plaintiff's option the defendants 
may be treated as primarily liable for the 
amount due from the borrower. There is 
nothing to suggest that the plaintiff should 
first 
exhaust 
its 
remedy 
against 
the 
borrower/principal debtor. This view finds 
support from the provision of section 137 of 
the Contract Act, which provides that a mere 
forbearance to sue the principal debtor or to 
enforce any other remedy against him does 
not in the absence of any provision to the 
contrary discharge the surety. In these 
circumstances the fact that the creditor has 
not sued or joined the principal debtor can 
hardly be a defence in a suit against the 
surety. This principal is so well settled that it 
is not necessary to discuss the authorities on 
the point. Suffice to mention, AIR 1927 Lah. 
396 AIR 1932 Lah. 419 AIR 1935 Mad. 748 
and AIR 1957 Pat 256. In Mahanth Singh v. 
U. Ba. YI. (1), it was held that failure to sue 
the principal debtor until recovery was barred 
by the Statute of Limitation did not operate as 
discharge of the surety. 
The creditor's right to proceed against the 
surety is not accessory to the right to proceed 
against the principal debtor personally. A 
surety in the absence of a contract to the 
contrary cannot compel the creditor to first 
exhaust his remedy against the principal 
debtor. In view of the above discussion as in 
the present case liability of the surety is based 
on a letter of guarantee, which is distinct from 
the liability of the principal debtor, the suit is 
maintainable.”

11.  
In case titled “Suresh Narain Sinha v. Akhauri 
Balbhadra Prasad and others” (AIR 1957 PATNA 
256), the arguments of learned advocate for surety that 
the suit cannot succeed unless the plaintiff has 
exhausted his remedies against the principal debtor, 
were repelled while concluding that failure to sue the 
principal debtor, until recovery was barred by the 
statutes of limitation, did not operate as discharge of the 
surety. The following extract from the above judgment 
is relevant:- 
“(4) It was then contended on behalf of 
the appellant that even if there was a 
contract of guarantee between the 
parties, the suit cannot succeed unless 
the plaintiff has exhausted his remedies 
against the principal debtor, namely, the 
Modern Bank of India, Ltd. defendant 
No. 5, with its registered Head Office at 
Dacca. We do not think there is any 
substance in this argument. It is 
provided by S. 128 of the Indian 
Contract Act that the liability of the 
surety is co extensive with that of the 
principal debtor, unless it is otherwise 
provided by the contract. There is high 
authority in support of this view in 
Mahanth Singh V. U. Ba YI, AIR 1939 
PC 110 (G). It was held by the Privy 
Council in that case that failure to sue 
the principal debtor until recovery was 
barred by the statutes of limitation did 
not operate as discharge of the 
surety….” 
 
12.  
In view of the above discussed provisions of 
the Contract Act and referred decisions, the argument 
of Malik Shahid Iqbal Babbar (learned ASC) that the 
principal-debtor was required to be proceeded against 
before institution of the suit against surety is found  
incorrect, therefore, the said argument stands rejected.

13.  
Now coming to the next contention regarding 
the second agreement and the stance that this agreement 
resulted into rescinding the first agreement or release 
the Appellant from his liability. This contention stand 
negated from the simple reading of the second 
agreement as a whole and in particular the following 
clause contained therein:- 
"۔۔۔
زمدی  ہی  ہک  اعمدہہ  ذہا  وج
ہک  اسہقب  اعمدہہ  ومرہخ  
2014۔10۔11
 
  یک وتعیس اور اتزہ رحتری وہےن یک اینبد رپ الص اور
اسہقب ااٹشم یک تشپ رپ ذم وکرہ رشاطئ
ڈنکنشی اگڑی دبوتسران
فذ 
"المعل وہیگن۔۔۔   
 
  
 
The thumb print and signatures of the 
Appellant are again available on the second agreement. 
The above clause is essentially making reference to the 
Note, besides other clauses, contained in the first 
agreement. Though the thumb print and signatures of 
the Appellant on the second agreement are placed as 
identifier but it precludes possibility of keeping 
anything hidden from the Appellant as well as it reveals 
the clear intention of the parties to keep the surety intact 
and the fact that the Appellant was never relieved from 
his liability.    
14.  
The Respondent entered in the witness box 
and stood by the averments in the suit. The cheque is 
also brought on the record as Ex. P-6. In support of his 
stance, Majid Rasheed appeared as PW-2 who deposed 
that the principal-debtor was approached by the 
Respondent, who refused to return the amount that he 
received. He verified the contents of the first agreement 
(Ex.P-1) and the second agreement (Ex.P-3). Almost 
same was deposed by Muhammad Suleman (PW-3). 

 
(1) R.F.A. No. 676 of 2021 
(2) R.F.A. No.63163-2020 
 
 
10 
The three witnesses were cross-examined in length but 
nothing adverse or sufficient to rebut the presumption 
arising under section 118 of the N.I.A., 1881 is noticed. 
The Appellant appeared as DW-1 and in response to a 
question, he admitted signing the second agreement 
(Ex.P-3). He has not denied issuance, presentation and 
dishonor of the cheque. After hearing the arguments 
and reading the record, I am of the firm opinion that the 
learned trial Court has reached to the correct 
conclusion. The titled appeal being meritless is 
dismissed, with further cost of Rs. 2,50,000/-. 
15.  
As far as the appeal No. 63163 of 2020 is 
concerned, the learned counsel for the Respondent 
though initially claimed interest in terms of the relevant 
provisions of N.I.A., 1881, however, he stated that he 
has instructions not to press the claim of interest if this 
Court is convinced to allow reasonable cost in favour of 
the Respondent and against the Appellant. In view of 
the same, appeal of the Respondent is dismissed being 
not pressed.
