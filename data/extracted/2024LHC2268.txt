JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing 
15.05.2024 
Appellant by 
Mr. Muhammad Akram Khan, Advocate 
Respondent by: 
Mr. Haider Zaman Khan, Advocate 
 
 
 
ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J.  This regular first appeal 
is directed against the order and decree dated 03.07.2023 
(impugned order), whereby the suit for possession through 
specific performance instituted by the appellant against the 
respondent has been dismissed due to non-deposit of 
remaining sale consideration.  
2. 
Relevant facts are that respondent is owner of land 
measuring 77-Kanal 04-Marla according to Register Haqdaran 
Zamin for the year 2019-2020 situated within the revenue 
limits of Mauza Goil, Tehsil Ferozewala, District Sheikhupura 
(suit property). It is averred in the suit that appellant and 
respondent entered into agreement to sell dated 12.10.2022 for 
total 
sale 
consideration 
of 
Rs.10,13,25,000/- 
@ 
Rs.1,05,00,000/- per acre  and out of total aforesaid sale 

 
 
RFA No.45873/2023 
-2- 
 
 
 
consideration, the appellant paid Rs.2,00,00,000/- as earnest 
money and the remaining amount was to be paid by 
26.05.2023. Due to failure on part of the respondent to perform 
his part of agreement, the suit was filed.  During course of 
proceedings, the order dated 17.03.2023 was passed to deposit 
the 
remaining 
sale 
consideration 
and 
after 
various 
opportunities, the suit was dismissed for non-deposit of the 
remaining sale amount on 03.07.2023, hence this appeal. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the 
respondent denied the execution of agreement to sell and 
claimed it to be a forged and fictitious document, therefore, the 
appellant was not required to deposit the remaining sale 
consideration in view of law settled by the Supreme Court in 
Muhammad Asif Awan vs. Dawood Khan and others (2021 
SCMR 1270). Further submits that the appellant had already 
filed application under Order XXIII Rule 1 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) to withdraw the suit due to 
formal defect but instead of allowing said application, the suit 
was dismissed.  
4. 
The learned counsel for the respondent on the other 
hand supported the impugned order. Further submits that after 
dismissal of the suit on 03.07.2023, another suit through Irfan 
Ali (witness of agreement to sell) has been filed in respect of 
the same suit property and interim relief has been obtained. He 

 
 
RFA No.45873/2023 
-3- 
 
 
 
submits that in said suit, the appellant is respondent No.1 but 
astonishingly neither any role is attributed to the appellant nor 
any relief has been claimed against him. He submits that 
appellant is abusing the process of this Court by filing 
different frivolous suits and harassing the respondent.  
5. 
Arguments heard. The record shows that appellant filed 
suit for specific performance on the basis of agreement to sell 
dated 12.10.2022 in respect of suit property and claimed that 
out of total sale consideration Rs.10,13,25,000/-, he paid 
Rs.2,00,00,000/- 
and 
therefore, 
balance 
amount 
is 
Rs.8,13,25,000/-. The Trial Court passed restraining order 
against alienation of the suit property on 18.01.2023 and 
before filing of the written statement on 17.03.2023 directed 
the appellant to deposit remaining sale consideration before 
the next date of hearing. Thereafter the appellant was granted 
repeated last opportunities on 17.04.2023, 10.05.2023 and 
25.05.2023 but the remaining sale consideration was not 
deposited. Finally on 10.06.2023, the counsel for the appellant 
gave undertaking to deposit remaining sale consideration 
before the next date of hearing without fail and on said 
undertaking, a specific direction was issued to deposit the 
remaining consideration otherwise suit will be dismissed. On 
03.07.2023, the appellant did not deposit the remaining sale 
consideration but filed application for withdrawal of the suit, 

 
 
RFA No.45873/2023 
-4- 
 
 
 
however the Trial Court declined withdrawal of suit 
application and also dismissed the suit for non-deposit of the 
sale consideration.  
6. 
The legal question requires determination in this case is 
that whether in such circumstances, the Court could dismiss 
the suit for non-deposit of the remaining sale consideration. 
This moot question remained subject matter of discussion 
before Supreme Court in following case law:-  
(i) The Supreme Court of Pakistan in judgment 
reported as Hamood Mehmood vs. Mst. Shababa 
Ishaque and others (2017 SCMR 2022) has held as 
follows:- 
 
“It is mandatory for the person whether 
plaintiff 
or 
defendant 
who 
seeks 
enforcement of the agreement under the 
Specific Relief Act, 1877, that on first 
appearance before the Court or on the 
date of institution of the suit, it shall apply 
to the Court getting permission to deposit 
the 
balance 
amount 
and 
any 
contumacious/omission in this regard 
would entail in dismissal of the suit or 
decretal of the suit, if it is filed by the other 
side.” 
 
(ii). The aforenoted judgment was followed by the apex 
Court in judgment reported as Messrs Kuwait National 
Real Estate Company (Pvt.) Ltd. and others vs. Messrs 
Educational Excellence Ltd. and another (2020 SCMR 
171) and held as under:- 
 
“It is now well settled that a party seeking 
specific performance of an agreement to 
sell is essentially required to deposit the 

 
 
RFA No.45873/2023 
-5- 
 
 
 
sale consideration amount in Court. In 
fact, by making such deposit the plaintiff 
demonstrates its capability, readiness and 
willingness to perform its part of the 
contract, which is an essential pre-
requisite to seek specific performance of a 
contract. Failure of a plaintiff to meet the 
said essential requirement disentitles him 
to the relief of specific performance, which 
undoubtedly is a discretionary relief.” 
 
 
(iii). The Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case reported 
as Muhammad Shafiq Ullah and others vs. Allah 
Bakhsh (deceased) through L.Rs. and others (2021 
SCMR 763) has held as under:- 
 
 
 
“6. 
Admittedly, neither Matiullah nor 
his legal heirs (the petitioners herein) 
tendered the balance sale consideration to 
the sellers (respondent Nos.4 to 10) nor 
deposited the same in court, if they had 
refused to receive it. Not paying the 
balance 
of 
the 
sale 
consideration 
constituted violation of an “essential term 
of the contract that on his (buyer’s part 
remains to be performed’ (clause (b) of 
section 24 of the Specific Relief Act). 
Therefore, for this reason too the specific 
performance of the purported contract 
could not be enforced. Matiullah and the 
petitioners also did not demonstrate that 
they were ready, able and willing to 
perform their obligation to make payment 
of the balance sale consideration.” 
 
(iv). The Supreme Court in case reported as 
Inayatullah Khan and others vs. Shabbir Ahmad Khan 
(2021 SCMR 686) has also examined the aforenoted 
question and in paragraph No.15 has observed as 
under:- 
 

 
 
RFA No.45873/2023 
-6- 
 
 
 
“A 
person 
seeking 
the 
specific 
performance of a contract  must first show 
that he is ready, able and willing to 
perform his obligations under the contract, 
but this the respondent had failed to do. 
The law does not require that the balance 
sale consideration must be tendered or 
deposited in court, but such tender/deposit 
helps establish that the buyer was not at 
fault. The respondent’s learned counsel’s 
contention that only after the court directs 
the deposit of the sale consideration, is it 
to be deposited, is misplaced. We may also 
take judicial notice of the fact that 
invariably the value of money depreciates 
over time and that of land appreciates. 
Courts adjudicating such cases should not 
be unmindful of this reality and should 
endeavour to secure the interest of both 
parties. In a suit for specific performance 
of land, if the seller/vendor has refused to 
receive the sale consideration, or any part 
thereof, it should be deposited in court and 
invested in some government protected 
security (such as Defence or National 
Savings Certificates); in case the suit is 
decreed the seller would receive the value 
of money which prevailed at the time of the 
contract and in case the buyer loses he can 
similarly retrieve the deposited amount”. 
  
 
(v). The apex Court in case reported as Mst. Samina 
Riffat and others vs. Rohail Asghar and others (2021 
SCMR 7) has also endorsed the aforenoted view in 
paragraph No.13 as under:- 
 
“In cases arising out of sale of immovable 
property 
a 
vendee 
seeking 
specific 
performance has to demonstrate his 
readiness and willingness to perform his 
part of reciprocal obligation as to payment 
of 
balance 
sale 
consideration. 
The 
question what is readiness and willingness 
to perform a contract was attended to by a 

 
 
RFA No.45873/2023 
-7- 
 
 
 
learned Division Bench of the West 
Pakistan High Court (Karachi) in the case 
of “Abdul Hamid vs. Abbas Bhai-Abdul 
Hussain” It was held that “In the first 
place, willingness to perform ones contract 
in respect of purchase of property implies 
the capacity to pay the requisite sale 
consideration within the reasonable time. 
In the second place, even if he has the 
capacity to pay the sale consideration, the 
question still remains whether he has the 
intention to purchase the property. On 
consideration of all the facts it appears 
that the appellant was not in a position to 
pay the balance sale consideration. At any 
rate, the appellant was not willing even if 
he had the capacity to pay the money, to 
have the sale deed completed.” 
 
 
7. 
The same view was also expressed in Muhammad 
Yousaf vs. Allah Ditta and others (2021 SCMR 1241) and 
Mst. Rehmat and others vs. Mst. Zubaida Begum and others 
(2021 SCMR 1534). From above case law it is manifest that 
the purpose of directing the vendee to deposit remaining sale 
consideration is on one hand to enable him to demonstrate his 
readiness, ableness and willingness to perform his contractual 
obligation and on the other hand also to safeguard the rights of 
the vendor. Therefore in ordinary circumstances, order by 
Court to deposit remaining sale consideration, cannot be 
termed as harsh, oppressive or unlawful. 
8. 
The argument of the appellant counsel that merely 
because respondent denied the execution of the agreement to 
sell, therefore, the appellant could not be required by Court to 

 
 
RFA No.45873/2023 
-8- 
 
 
 
deposit the balance sale consideration in view of Muhammad 
Asif Awan case supra, is also misconceived. In the case of 
Muhammad Asif Awan supra, the execution of agreement to 
sell was denied being forged and fictitious but notwithstanding 
the above fact, the Trial Court directed the vendee/plaintiff to 
deposit the remaining sale consideration which was finally 
deposited but during the time extended by the Trial Court as 
well as Appellate Court. In said case, the High Court set aside 
the order for extension of time and consequently dismissed the 
suit, however the Supreme Court allowed the appeal mainly on 
the ground that when direction to deposit remaining 
consideration has been issued to establish bonafide of the 
vendee/plaintiff and not at the instance of the vendor/ 
defendant, the Trial Court had power to extend the time, 
whereas in case the remaining amount deposit is at the 
instance of the vendor/defendant, the Court will become 
functus officio. In the present case, no doubt the direction to 
deposit the remaining sale consideration was not at the 
instance of the vendor but as per direction of the Court to 
prove the readiness and bonafide of the appellant but not only 
the appellant failed to deposit the remaining sale consideration 
despite several opportunities including last warning on 
10.06.2023 but the appellant otherwise never challenged the 

 
 
RFA No.45873/2023 
-9- 
 
 
 
said order for deposit of the balance sale consideration or 
sought extension of time to deposit the sale consideration.  
9. 
The Supreme Court in para 12 of the Judgment of 
Muhammad Asif Awan case supra, further held that suit can be 
dismissed for non-deposit of balance amount provided that the 
plaintiff has put to notice that non-deposit would deem to be 
his incapability of performance of his part of contract as 
envisaged under section 24(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 
(Act). Relevant para 12 is reproduced hereunder:- 
“In the given circumstances, unless the 
appellant would have been put to notice that the 
non-deposit of the balance sale price would be 
deemed to be his incapability of performing his 
part of the contract as envisaged under section 
24(b) rendering the contract non-enforceable, 
the suit could not have been dismissed. Even 
otherwise, the language employed in Order 
XVII, Rule 3 by using word, “the Court may, 
notwithstanding such default, proceed to decide 
the 
suit 
forthwith” 
is 
permissive 
and 
discretionary and does not in all circumstances 
entail penal consequences and the discretion 
exercised by the trial court by extending time 
for deposit of balance sale price pendente lite 
just for few days in the face of denial of deal by 
the vendor was not perverse entitling High 
Court to interfere in its writ jurisdiction.” 
 
In the present case, the appellant was specifically directed as last 
opportunity 
to deposit the remaining consideration on 
17.03.2023, 17.04.2023, 10.05.2023, 25.05.2023 and thereafter 
finally on 10.06.2023, he was put to notice that for non-deposit 
of the balance sale price, his suit will be dismissed. Therefore, 

 
 
RFA No.45873/2023 
-10- 
 
 
 
the petitioner’s case does not fall under the exception of para 12 
of Muhammad Asif Awan case supra.  
10. 
The next argument of the appellant that his application 
under Order XXIII Rule 1 CPC for withdrawal of the suit could 
not be dismissed has also no basis. Bare reading of said 
application shows that neither any formal defect nor sufficient 
ground for allowing the appellant to institute fresh suit for the 
subject matter of his suit or part of the claim has been specified. 
Therefore, the Trial Court has lawfully dismissed the said 
application being merely an attempt to circumvent the repeated 
directions of the Court to deposit the balance consideration. 
11. 
In view of above case law and the facts in this case as 
discussed above, it is manifest that the conduct of the appellant 
was not only contemptuous but also dilatory for the reason that 
he despite availing various opportunities including last and final 
opportunity dated 10.06.2023 failed to deposit the balance sale 
consideration, hence his suit was lawfully dismissed.  
12. 
In view of above discussion, this appeal being devoid 
of any merit is dismissed.
