Rasaal Hasan Syed, J. This order will 
dispose of the instant appeal as well as F.A.O. 
No.390 of 2013 titled Sh. Abdur Razzaq & 
Company (Pvt) Limited v. The Punjab Highway 
Department, etc. as both appeals stem from the 
same order dated 27.7.2013 of learned Civil 
Judge, Lahore whereby the objections to the 
award of arbitrators were disposed of and award 
was made rule of court.  
2. 
Facts as will be pertinent for decision of 
the 
two 
appeals 
are 
that 
contract 
for 
construction of bridge over River Chenab at 
Shahbazpur, District Gujrat named “Ch. Zahoor 
Elahi Shaheed Bridge” was awarded to Sh. 
Abdur Razzaq & Company (Pvt) Limited (the 
“contractor”) on 01.8.2007. Value of the 
contract based on work was Rs.1,345,120,000/- 
obligated to be completed in 24 months. 
Mobilization advance of Rs.99,843,000.00 with 
interest deductible in five installments was paid 

    F.A.O. No.524 of 2013

against furnishing of bank guarantee. A dispute 
surfaced in respect of the contract qua which a 
reference was solicited for determination by 
arbitration 
through 
an 
application 
under 
sections 8 and 9 of Arbitration Act, 1940 (the 
“Act”) by the contractor filed in civil court. 
Appointment of two arbitrators was made on 
24.2.2012 and the parties were directed to 
submit their claims before the arbitrators for 
final resolution of the dispute. The arbitrators 
entered upon the reference and made their 
award on 06.3.2013. Objections to the award 
were filed by Punjab Highway Department (the 
“department”) which were decided by the 
learned Civil Judge vide order dated 27.7.2013 
in terms whereof the objections were rejected 
but exercising powers under section 15 of the 
Act the court modified the award to the extent 
of adjustment and reimbursement of excess 
mobilization advance which the respondent had 
received in terms of the contract. Against the 
order dated 27.7.2013. The present FAO was 
filed by the department for setting aside the 
award while the contractor filed FAO No. 390 
of 2013 against the order to the extent of 
modification of award in respect of adjustment 
and reimbursement of the mobilization advance. 
3. 
Learned AAG referred to the objections 
against the award filed in the court below and 
submitted that the appellant amongst others 
specifically pleaded that the arbitrators had 
misconducted themselves and the proceedings; 
that the award was improperly procured by the 

    F.A.O. No.524 of 2013 
 
 
 
Page-3 
 
 
arbitrators with mala fide; that the arbitrators 
did not give proper opportunity to defend the 
matter to the appellant; that the arbitrators did 
not take authorized representative of the 
objector along with them at the time of site 
inspection 
and 
local 
inquiry 
and, 
thus, 
condemned it unheard which resulted in 
miscarriage of justice and that it was 
misconduct on the part of the arbitrators; that 
the arbitrators violated the terms and conditions 
of the contract; that the objections could be 
decided only after framing issues and allowing 
opportunity of evidence which course was not 
adopted by the trial court; and that the 
impugned order violated due process and the 
rule of natural, fair and proper justice. It was 
argued that the learned Civil Judge ignored that 
the award was not well-reasoned and speaking 
one and that the conclusions drawn by the 
arbitrators were not only violative of the 
contractual provisions but were also legally 
untenable. As against these arguments, in the 
perception of contractor’s learned counsel the 
objection was barred by time, therefore, the 
department 
had 
no 
case 
and 
that 
the 
mobilization advance was not a matter of 
dispute nor a subject-matter of reference, 
therefore, the court below acted illegally while 
going behind the award and exercising powers 
under section 15 of the Act. And that the court 
could not interpret the award by considering 
matters extraneous to the award nor could act as 
a court of appeal or go into the merits of the 

    F.A.O. No.524 of 2013 
 
 
 
Page-4 
 
 
case; and further that the trial court wrongly 
interpreted that the mobilization advance was 
payable by the respondent. 
4. 
Submissions made by learned counsel for 
both sides have been given due consideration in 
the light of the available record. The ground 
amongst others for setting aside the impugned 
order raised by the learned AAG appearing for 
the department was that the objection raised 
against the award could not have been decided 
without 
framing 
of 
issues 
and 
giving 
opportunity 
of 
evidence 
denial 
whereof 
rendered the order violative of due process and 
rule of natural justice. Before opining on the 
findings of the court below in the impugned 
order, it is necessary to consider the scope of 
jurisdiction of the court and its obligations 
under the Act in respect of an award before 
making it a rule of court. In the perception of 
learned counsel for the contractor, once the  
objections are observed to be time-barred, the 
court did not have any jurisdiction to look into 
the award and shall proceed to pass an order, 
making it a rule of court in a mechanical 
manner and that in the instant case learned court 
while modifying the award exceeded its 
jurisdiction. The argument does not sound 
good. Under section 30 of the Act, the award 
can be set aside on the ground that the 
arbitrator(s) or umpire had misconducted 
themselves or the proceedings; that the award 
was made after the issue of an order by the 
court superseding the arbitration or after the 

    F.A.O. No.524 of 2013 
 
 
 
Page-5 
 
 
arbitration proceedings had become invalid 
under section 35. Section 17 of the Act  
mandates that where the court sees no cause to 
remit the award or any of the matters referred to 
arbitration for consideration or to set aside the 
award the court,  after the time for making an 
application to set aside the award has expired or 
such application  having been made, after 
refusing  it, shall proceed to pronounce 
judgment according to the award and upon the 
judgment so pronounced a decree shall follow. 
The provision of section 17 ibid. and the scope 
of  jurisdiction thereunder has remained subject-
matter of consideration in number of cases by 
the superior courts and the consistent rule is that 
the provision of section 17 imposes the duty 
upon the court to see that there is no cause to 
remit the award or any other matter referred to 
arbitration for consideration or to set aside the 
award  and such power can be exercised suo 
motu by the court and even in the cases where 
the objections were not filed or were  time-
barred. Reference in this respect can be made to 
the case of A. Qutubuddin Khan v. Chec 
Millwala Dredging Co. (Pvt.) Limited (2014 
SCMR 1268) wherein it was observed as 
below: 
 
10. 
In view of the above, the obvious 
question that floats to the surface is  that in the 
eventuality that an Award was filed in the court 
and objections thereto are either not filed or if 
filed found to be barred by limitation, whether  
the Court is to mechanically make such an 
Award, the Rule  of the Court. The powers 
vested in the Court to make an Award the Rule 
of the Court are obviously judicial and not 

    F.A.O. No.524 of 2013 
 
 
 
Page-6 
 
 
ministerial and it is now settled law that the 
absence of objections to such an Award does 
not absolve the Court of its responsibility to 
examine the same. In the instant case, the 
learned Single Judge, after concluding that the 
objections filed by the respondent were time 
barred, without conducting a judicial exercise of 
examining the Award qua its validity, made the 
same the Rule of the Court. Hence its order in 
this behalf dated 5.8.2000 was not sustainable in 
law and was rightly set aside by way of the 
impugned judgment and the case remanded. 
Reference can also be made to M/s. Awan 
Industries Ltd. v. The Executive Engineer, Lined 
Channel Division and another (1992 SCMR 65) 
where it was observed that: 
17. 
But; in his submissions, he ignored the 
provisions of section 17 of the Arbitration Act, 
which imposes a duty on Courts to see that there 
is no cause to remit the award or any of the 
matters referred to arbitration for reconsideration 
or to set aside the award. This can be done by 
the court suo motu, apart from the application 
which a party may make for either remission of 
the award or its reversal. Where, therefore an 
award is found to be nullity because of the 
invalidity  of the arbitration agreement or, for any 
other reason or the award is prima facie illegal 
and not fit to be maintained, the court has power 
under section 17 of the Act to set it aside  without 
waiting for an objection to award being filed or 
without considering  any application for setting it 
aside, if there be any, and irrespective  of the 
question whether or not any objection to the 
award was filed or whether the objection, if filed, 
was not within time… 
 
In Karachi Dock Labour Board v. Messers 
Quality Builders Ltd. (PLD 2016 SC 121) it was 
observed as follows: 
Therefore, although in the instant case an express 
objection to jurisdiction of the arbitrator was 
sought, we are of the view that notwithstanding 
the absence of objections filed by any party 
and/or the fact that parties may consent to the 
making the award a rule of Court, the Court is 
duty bound to examine the validity and legality of 
an award and it may sua sponte modify or set 
aside the award if the facts and dictates of justice 
so demand. The Court, in our opinion, cannot and 

    F.A.O. No.524 of 2013 
 
 
 
Page-7 
 
 
certainly should not, remain dormant by merely 
affixing the judicial stamp on an award. The court 
is not a part of an assembly line which has to 
churn out finished products mechanically without 
applying its judicial mind  to the process 
involved… 
It is manifest from the rule in the cases supra 
that while making an award rule of court, in a 
case where the parties did not file objections, the 
court is not supposed to act in a mechanical 
manner like the proverbial post office and place 
its seal on it but it is obligated to look into the 
award and if it finds patent illegality on the face 
of award it is empowered to set aside, modify or 
remit the award for reconsideration. 
5. 
It is evident from the impugned order that 
material portion of objections were disposed of 
in a casual manner without considering their 
legal effect. It was a case where the contractor 
claimed various amounts as compensation for 
the losses and damages allegedly sustained on 
the plea of breach of contract by the department 
which were controverted by the department and 
raising serious objections against the contractor 
and maintaining that despite receiving huge 
amount of mobilization advance, the respondent 
had failed to perform its part. In the award the 
arbitrators allowed number of claims which 
were challenged item-wise in the objections by 
alleging that there was no basis or evidence for 
them and that the award was lacking reasons to 
allow such amount to the contractor. The learned 
Civil Judge failed to consider these objections in 
the legal perspective by assuming that the court 
was not competent to look into the reasoning or 

    F.A.O. No.524 of 2013 
 
 
 
Page-8 
 
 
the basis of award. The operative part of the 
order is as under: 
…It is settled principle of law that trial court 
cannot sit over the award as court of appeal and 
to go through the merits of the case rather trial 
court should lean in favour of award instead of 
setting aside the same. Both the Arbitrators were 
senior, competent, and experienced Engineers 
from the respondent’s department therefore, the 
respondent should not raise objection on 
Arbitrator’s award who after hearing the parties 
have submitted the award on the basis of the 
reference filed by the applicant… 
6. 
It is thus obvious that the trial court opted 
not to interfere in the award on the assumption 
that the court could not look into it even for the 
purposes of satisfying as to whether the award 
was based on any evidence or that the reasons 
recorded by the arbitrators awarding huge 
amount did have any supporting evidence and as 
to whether there was any basis for assuming the 
amount 
as 
compensation. 
It 
is 
legal 
commonplace the court while deciding the 
objections does not act as a court of appeal nor 
could substitute the findings of the arbitrators, 
but it does not mean that it will endorse an 
award that had no evidentiary basis or if reasons 
given by the arbitrators were legally untenable.  
7. 
Section 26-A of Act will be relevant in 
this regard which empowers the court to remit 
the award which does not record reasons as 
contemplated by law for consideration of the 
court to determine the legal questions involved 
in the matter. Section 26-A as incorporated in 
the Act itself by the Law Reforms Ordinance 
(XII) of 1972 reads as follows: 

    F.A.O. No.524 of 2013 
 
 
 
Page-9 
 
 
26-A. Award to set out reasons (1) The 
arbitrators or umpire shall state in the award the 
reasons for the award in sufficient detail to enable 
the Court to consider any question of law arising 
out of the award. 
(2) 
Where the award does not state the 
reasons in sufficient detail, the Court shall remit 
the award to the arbitrators or umpire and fix the 
time within which the arbitrator or umpire shall 
submit the award together with the reasons in 
sufficient detail. 
Provided that any time so fixed may be 
extended by subsequent order of the Court. 
(3) 
An award remitted under sub section (2) 
shall become void on the failure of the arbitrator or 
umpire to submit it in accordance with the direction 
of the Court. 
In the case of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation 
v. Associated Constructors Ltd. (1984  CLC  
1077)  it was observed that the object of section 
26-A of the Act was that if the award is based on 
irrelevant and extraneous consideration or 
erroneous view of law or material facts or other 
relevant matters are not considered those could 
be made known to the parties so that any of 
them aggrieved by the award could challenge the 
same and also enable the court to consider any 
question of law arising out of such award. It was 
observed that the court will remit the award to 
the 
arbitrators 
where 
reasons 
were 
not 
articulated for awarding substantial amount to 
the party and how the arbitrator had arrived at 
those figures by mentioning separately various 
amounts awarded by them under various heads 
claimed by the contractor. In such cases the 
award had to be remitted. Excerpt from the 
above-noted precedent is as under: 
 

    F.A.O. No.524 of 2013 
 
 
 
Page-10 
 
 
14. 
We have already quoted the material 
part of the award and from its perusal, it is quite 
clear that except stating that he has reached the 
conclusion that the plaintiff (respondent) is 
entitled to a payment of Rs. 1,60,647/- 
(Rs.7,23,300 in the award in suit No. 908 of 
1981) which include escalation due to losses 
suffered by the respondent on account of delay 
caused by the appellant. He has, however, 
neither stated any reason for awarding such 
substantial amounts nor has he stated how he 
has arrived at these figures by mentioning 
separately the various amounts awarded by him 
under various heads claimed by the respondent. 
Indeed, in the absence of the reasons it was not 
possible for the appellant and for that matter for 
this Court to know what amount has been 
awarded by the Arbitrator under each head. 
15. 
 We have already stated that the learned 
Single Judge himself has observed that the 
awards are non-speaking awards. Indeed, he 
refused to look into the record for that reason. 
For all these reasons we find no substance in the 
first part of the submission. 
Reference can also be made to the case of Umer 
Din through L.Rs. v.  Mst.Shakeela Bibi and 
others (2009 SCMR 29) where it was observed as 
under: 
7. The above noted text of the award clearly 
depicts that the Arbitrators had failed to give out 
the reasons for reaching to the conclusions of 
their decision. On the basis of which document, 
or evidence they had arrived at that conclusion 
was not given out  in the award so as to enable 
the court making the award a rule of Court, to 
examine the correctness of the reasons and 
conclusions. No sufficient detail has been found 
by us in the above noted award as envisaged by 
section 26-A of the Arbitration Act, 1940 to 
perceive the decision noted in the award. 
Section 26-A of the Arbitration Act 1940  which 
was inserted by Arbitration (Amendment) 
Ordinance XV of 1981, was not interjected into 
the Act without any aim or purpose behind it by 
the Legislature. The  Civil Court which had to 
make the award the rule of Court was granted an 

    F.A.O. No.524 of 2013 
 
 
 
Page-11 
 
 
opportunity and power to examine the reasons of 
adjudication of the subject matter in dispute by 
the Arbitrators. As to how and on what basis, the 
Arbitrators had decided and made  the award, 
was to be scrutinized critically by the learned 
Court, to check up as to whether  the Award was 
based on whimsical  grounds, without any 
foundation or reason or it was  supported by and 
rendered on some basis, evidence and 
document. In other words, arbitrary, non-
speaking, sketchy, careless and sleazy award, 
deciding the fate of the parties to the dispute was 
not to be blessed with approval to give them 
authority  of Court, by making it a rule of Court. 
The award which does not contain reasons in 
sufficient detail has to be rejected and is not to 
be approved by the civil court so as to make it 
rule of Court. An arbitration award is enforceable 
and is to be granted approval  of the Court to be 
transferred into the shape and form of rule of 
Court when it complies with the essential 
characteristics 
and 
requirements 
as 
are 
contained in section 26-A of the Arbitration Act of 
1940. In the instant case no reason has been 
given by the Arbitrators, for deciding the dispute. 
Therefore, we fully endorse the view pronounced 
in 2001 SCMR 750, 2006 SCMR 614 and 2006 
SCMR 1657 (supra) as referred to by the learned 
counsel for the appellants…   
In the case of Allah Din & Company v. Trading 
Corporation Of Pakistan and others (2006 
SCMR 614) it was observed as under: 
5…The learned Division Bench in the impugned 
judgment had aptly rejected the above claim on 
the ground that compensation for loss of goodwill 
or reputation is generally not awarded, particularly 
in the absence of tangible evidence showing 
additional loss and further that since the purchaser 
was already awarded Rs. 1 million by the arbitrator 
as compensation for the anticipated loss of profit 
further compensation on account of loss of 
goodwill and reputation was not justified. We find 
ourselves in agreement with the reasoning of the 
learned Division Bench… 
6.  The contention of the learned counsel for the 
purchaser that the Court is not entitled to disagree 
with the findings of the Arbitrator is without force. It 
is true that the trial court does not sit in appeal 
from the finding of the arbitrator but at the same 

    F.A.O. No.524 of 2013 
 
 
 
Page-12 
 
 
time the court is empowered to reverse the 
findings of the arbitrator on any issue if it does not 
find support from the evidence. The very 
incorporation of section 26-A of the Arbitration Act 
requiring  the arbitrator to furnish reasons for his 
finding was to enable the court  to examine the 
soundness of the reasons. As already held the 
arbitrator in the case before us had granted 
damages for loss of reputation and goodwill 
without there being any evidence to that effect. 
The Courts were, therefore, justified in denying 
this claim to the purchaser…  
Reference can also be made to The Director 
Industries And Mineral Development v. Dada 
Bhoyhormusjee & Sons (1990 MLD  301) 
where it was observed to the effect that the 
arbitrator having ignored an important piece of 
evidence on record before him, it was patent that 
he misconducted the proceedings pending before 
him and that in view of section 26-A whereby an 
arbitrator is required to give reasons for the 
award, a heavier responsibility lay on such 
domestic forums to deal with all matters going 
to the root of the dispute and failure to do so 
would constituted misconduct, for the required, 
to give reasons, is not a meaningless exercise. 
8. 
In view of the rule supra, if the impugned 
order is considered, it is obvious that the learned 
Civil Judge neither considered the reasons for 
setting aside the award nor considered as to 
whether the award was liable to be remitted and 
by simply observing that the award had been 
delivered by two Arbitrators who are Officers of 
the Department irrespective of the fact whether 
the award was invalid, it was violative of the 
contract or otherwise violative of the rule of due 
process and that it had no basis. In these 
circumstances the case needs to be remanded for 

    F.A.O. No.524 of 2013 
 
 
 
Page-13 
 
 
decision afresh on the objection to the award by 
framing proper issues and allowing the parties to 
produce evidence and in the light of the rule 
referred supra. 
9. 
For the reasons hereinabove this appeal is 
accepted, impugned order is set aside, case is 
remanded to the Civil Judge for decision afresh 
after framing issues and recording evidence and 
keeping in view the rule applicable on the 
subject as observed supra while F.A.O. No. 390 
of 2013 titled Sh. Abdur Razzaq & Company 
(Pvt) 
Limited 
v. 
The 
Punjab 
Highway 
Department, etc. having become infructuous is 
disposed of accordingly.
