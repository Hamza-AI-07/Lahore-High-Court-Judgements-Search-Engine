Writ Petition No.50434 of 2023 
 
 
 
Muhammad Irfan    Versus     Addl. District Judge, etc. 
 
J U D G M E N T 
Date of Hearing: 
17.10.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Muhammad Yaseen Chughtai, 
Advocate. 
Respondents No.2 to 
5 by: 
Mr. 
Amir 
Waqas 
Chaudhary, 
Advocate. 
  Anwaar Hussain, J.  By way of factual background, it has been 
noted that respondents No.2 to 5 (“the respondents”) filed an 
ejectment petition against the petitioner, on the basis of an oral 
tenancy. The petitioner denied the tenancy relationship, while filing 
leave to appear and contest the ejectment petition that was allowed. 
After framing of issues and recording of evidence, final order dated 
13.06.2023 was passed by the Rent Tribunal. The petitioner was held 
liable to be evicted and also directed to pay the outstanding rent 
amount w.e.f., October 2016. When the appeal was preferred by the 
petitioner against order dated 13.06.2023, the Appellate Court, through 
impugned order dated 10.07.2023, admitted the appeal and directed the 
parties to maintain the status quo, however, the petitioner was also 
directed to deposit arrears of rent at the rate of Rs.13,800/- per month, 
with 10% annual increase from October, 2016 till June, 2023, and 
monthly rent during pendency of the appeal. Hence, the present 
constitutional petition has been filed.

2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the relationship 
of landlord and tenant was denied by the petitioner before the Rent 
Tribunal and, hence, there is no justification in passing the impugned 
order, while admitting the appeal, and directing the petitioner to deposit 
arrears of rent as it defeats the purpose of preferring an appeal, 
inasmuch as it is settled principle of law that where relationship of 
landlord and tenant is denied, order of deposit of rent is an exercise in 
excess of the jurisdiction by the Rent Tribunal. Adds that the same 
principle applies to the appellate proceedings. Places reliance on the 
case reported as “Ashiq Hussain and another v. Jamia Masjid Hanfia 
Ghousia through President” (PLD 2007 Lahore 283) in support of his 
contentions.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents has placed 
reliance upon case reported as “Sarfraz v. Mukhtar Ahmed and others” 
(2016 CLC Note 48) and submits that in terms of sub-Section (6) of 
Section 28 of the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (“the Act”), all 
the powers, which the Rent Tribunal possess are available with the 
Appellate Court and the impugned order has been rightly passed in 
terms of Section 24 that contemplates that the Rent Tribunal can pass 
the interim order directing the tenant to deposit amount of monthly rent 
due in favour of a landlord irrespective of the fact that the tenancy 
relationship has been denied.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
The only legal question that requires determination by this Court 
is articulated as under: 
Whether in an appeal, emanating from the eviction 
proceedings, wherein the respondent has denied the 
relationship of landlord and tenant, the Appellate Court 
while admitting the said appeal can pass an order 
directing the appellant to deposit the arears of rent, 

3 
W.P. No.50434 of 2023 
 
 
adjudicated by the Rent Tribunal, along with regular 
deposit of monthly rent, till the pendency of the appeal? 
6. 
Section 24 of the Act deals with the deposit of rent, during the 
pendency of the ejectment petition, before the Rent Tribunal. The same 
reads as under: 
“24.  
Payment of rent and other dues pending 
proceedings.– (1) If an eviction application is filed, the 
Rent Tribunal, while granting leave to contest, shall direct 
the tenant to deposit the rent due from him within a 
specified time and continue to deposit the same in 
accordance with the tenancy agreement or as may be 
directed by the Rent Tribunal in the bank account of the 
landlord or in the Rent Tribunal till the final order. 
      (2)  If there is a dispute as to the amount of rent due or 
rate of rent, the Rent Tribunal shall tentatively determine 
the dispute and pass the order for deposit of the rent in 
terms of sub-section (1). 
      (3)  In case the tenant has not paid a utility bill, the Rent 
Tribunal shall direct the tenant to pay the utility bill. 
      (4)  If a tenant fails to comply with a direction or order of 
the Rent Tribunal, the Rent Tribunal shall forthwith pass 
the final order.” 
When an eviction petition is filed and the respondent therein appears 
and files leave to appear and contest the case, Section 24 comes into 
play and the Rent Tribunal is empowered to pass an order directing the 
tenant to deposit the monthly rent due.  
7. 
The question whether the respondent of an eviction petition who 
denies the tenancy relationship, with the ejectment petitioner, can be 
directed by the Rent Tribunal to deposit the rent due till the pendency 
of the eviction proceedings came under discussion before this Court in 
number of cases. While examining scope of Section 24 of the Act, in 
case reported as “Umar Farooq v. Rent Controller/Civil Judge, Multan 
and another” (2018 CLC Note 42), this Court held that a Rent 
Tribunal could not pass an order for deposit of tentative rent if the 
relationship of landlord and tenant was yet to be established and the 
Rent Tribunal would have to frame an issue with respect to the 

4 
W.P. No.50434 of 2023 
 
 
relationship of landlord and tenant and decide the same, before 
proceeding to pass an order for deposit of the rent.  
8. 
Similar question also came under discussion before this Court in 
terms of provisions of the erstwhile West Pakistan Urban Rent 
Restriction Ordinance, 1959 (‘the Ordinance’) while interpreting sub-
Section (6) of Section 13 thereof that is in pari materia with sub-
Section (2) of Section 24 of the Act. This Court in case reported as 
“Babu Din v. Civil Judge/Rent Controller, Multan and 6 others” (2006 
CLC 926) held that the Rent Controller could not pass tentative rent 
order where relationship of landlord and tenant has been denied and 
could only do so once the said relationship was determined. Similar 
view was taken in case reported as “Mrs. Yasmin Razi-ud-Din and 
another v. Mst. Tehmina” (2012 CLC 1223). Case of Aashiq Hussain 
and others supra relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioner is 
also referred in his regard. 
9. 
In other Provinces, the law on the subject is pari materia to 
Section 24 of the Act as well as Section 13 of the Ordinance. Other 
Coordinate High Courts in the Provinces as well as Islamabad Capital 
Territory (“the ICT”) have taken similar view. In case reported as 
“Haji Abdul Sattar v. Dr. Shahid Inayat and another” (2003 CLC 
1870), the Peshawar High Court held that since the relationship of 
landlord and tenant has been denied and the same was not frivolous, 
the Rent Controller was bound to frame a preliminary issue about the 
tenancy relationship between the parties before proceeding further or 
passing an order for deposit of the rent. Similar view was also taken by 
the Peshawar High Court in another case reported as “Irfan Ullah Shah 
v. Wahabullah and another” (2003 YLR 1195). The Sindh High Court 
in case reported as “Muhammad Danish Rafiq v. Mst. Nafisa Siddiqui 
and another” (2009 MLD 144) and the Islamabad High Court, in case 

5 
W.P. No.50434 of 2023 
 
 
reported as “Muhammad Taj v. Muhammad Younis Khilji and another” 
(2008 CLC 1666) have also taken the same view. 
10. 
On the contrary, in case of Sarfraz supra, relied upon by learned 
counsel for the respondent, this Court held that a Rent Tribunal while 
granting leave to contest had powers to pass order for deposit of arrears 
of rent and the respondent in the case denying the tenancy relationship 
must produce some documents to show his title over the disputed 
property/rented premises, when the tenancy is denied, failing which 
mere denial of tenancy without any solid proof did not debar the Rent 
Tribunal from passing directions for deposit of rent. Another contra 
view on the subject has been also rendered by this Court while dealing 
with the scope of Section 24 of the Act, in case reported as “Dr. 
Shahida Hasnain v. Mian Umar Ikram-ul-Haq and another” (PLD 
2016 Lahore 123). This Court held that the mandate of Section 24 is 
clear and after allowing the application for leave to contest, it falls 
upon the Rent Tribunal to pass an order for the deposit of rent due from 
the tenant and continue to deposit the same in accordance with the 
tenancy agreement even if the relationship has been denied by the 
respondent as sub-Section (2) of Section 24 of the Act lays down that if 
there is dispute as to the amount of rent due, then the Rent Tribunal 
shall tentatively determine the dispute and pass the order for the 
deposit of rent and since the term “rent due” has a wide sweep and 
would include a dispute of the nature where the tenancy relationship is 
denied, therefore, any other construction would not only nullify the 
intention of the legislature but also would give a lever in the hands of 
the tenants to avoid the payment of rent.  
11.  
Further analysis of the jurisprudence developed on the subject 
reveals that the matter also came before the Supreme Court of Pakistan, 
more particularly, while hearing civil petition for leave to appeal 
against the decision rendered by this Court in case of Dr. Shahida 

6 
W.P. No.50434 of 2023 
 
 
Hasnain supra. The pronouncement rendered by the Supreme Court is 
reported as “Mian Umar Ikram ul Haque v. Dr. Shahida Hasnain and 
another” (2016 SCMR 2186). The findings of this Court in case of Dr. 
Shahida Husnain supra were reversed. The Supreme Court held that 
since the denial of the relationship created a jurisdictional issue for the 
Rent Tribunal, the same would have to be decided before an order 
under Section 24 of the Act can be passed. The Supreme Court held as 
under: 
“5. 
…Through the impugned judgment the learned 
High Court has tried to resolve the question at hand by 
dwelling upon the larger scheme of the new rent laws by 
trying to decipher the latent intent of the legislature, 
which in our view was completely unnecessary because 
the answer to the question is quite patent. A plain 
reading of section 24 of the Act reproduced 
hereinabove makes it clear that a direction is not to be 
issued to the respondent of an eviction application but 
to a tenant. The use of the word 'tenant' as opposed to 
'respondent' speaks to the legislative intent. This usage 
appears to be conscious and deliberate, because 
elsewhere in the Act where the parties to a lis are 
meant to be referred to without identifying their legal 
characters, the words 'applicant' and 'respondent' are 
used instead of 'landlord' and 'tenant' (see Sections 19, 
21 and 22 etc.). Where there is a specific intention to do 
so and the attending context requires that the parties be 
referred to by their legal status, the legislature has used 
the words 'landlord' and 'tenant' (see sections 5, 7, 9, 10, 
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 24 etc.). It is a settled canon of 
statutory interpretation that where a statute uses a 
particular word(s), the presumption is that such 
word(s) is illustrative of the legislative intent unless 
there are very cogent reasons to displace the same and 
in our view, there are no such reasons that justify 
interpreting section 24 of the Act in a way that defeats 
its express meaning. Therefore, it follows that where 
the relationship of landlord and tenant is denied, the 
Rent Tribunal would lack jurisdiction, on account of 
the doctrine of jurisdictional fact, to pass an order for 
payment of rent due under section 24 of the Act until 
and unless the Tribunal positively ascertains the 
relationship of tenancy and establishes that the 

7 
W.P. No.50434 of 2023 
 
 
respondent to the eviction application is in fact a 
'tenant' in terms of section 2(1) of the Act…... To hold 
otherwise would be to defeat the express intention of the 
statute, which is that an order for payment of rent due 
should only be passed against a tenant, and not merely a 
respondent of an eviction application. The relationship 
of landlord and tenant is an essential question which has 
a direct effect upon the assumption and exercise of the 
jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal, which (question) must 
necessarily be positively ascertained before passing an 
order for payment of rent due under section 24 of the 
Act.” 
  
 
 
 
 
               (Emphasis supplied) 
12. 
Scanning of catena of the judgments under the Act as also under 
the Ordinance and under the law in vogue in other Provinces and the 
ICT on the subject depicts the predominant view of the Courts in the 
terms that an order for deposit of interim or tentative rent should not be 
passed if the relationship of landlord and tenant is denied. In view of 
the ratio decidendi laid down by the Supreme Court in case of Mian 
Umar Ikram ul Haque supra, there appears no doubt as to the intent of 
the legislature that the Rent Tribunal cannot direct the respondent in an 
eviction petition to deposit the rent where relationship of landlord and 
tenant is denied and the Rent Tribunal grants the leave to appear and 
contest the eviction petition. Here it is imperative to note that in the 
context of the Ordinance, a similar view was also taken by the Supreme 
Court in case reported as “Ghulam Rasool v. Mian Khurshid Ahmed”  
(2000 SCMR 632).  
13. 
The predominant view on the legal issue gains traction inasmuch 
as the grant of leave to contest in cases where the tenancy relationship 
is denied, is itself indicative of the fact that the denial is not frivolous 
or perfunctory and requires recording of evidence. In cases where the 
denial of tenancy relationship is frivolous and shallow, the Rent 
Tribunal, is empowered to refuse the leave and straightaway allow the 
eviction application and whilst so doing, the Rent Tribunal can 

8 
W.P. No.50434 of 2023 
 
 
simultaneously pass an order under Section 24 of the Act finally 
determining the rent due from the tenant and direct that the same be 
deposited/paid as held in case of Mian Umar Ikram ul Haque supra.  
14.  
Having the above legal position in sight, this Court has to answer 
the legal question formulated above and to opine whether the same rule 
is applicable to the appellate proceedings emanating from a lis under 
the Act. It can be argued that once the Rent Tribunal has held a 
respondent of the eviction petition to be a tenant, there is a judicial 
verdict against the said respondent and therefore, the Appellate Court 
can pass an order directing such respondent (appellant before it) to 
deposit the arrears of rent, as also the monthly rent, during the 
pendency of appeal, as directed through the impugned order, in the 
instant case. Section 28 of the Act deals with the appeals and in terms 
of its sub-Section (6), the powers of the Rent Tribunal are available to 
the Appellate Court. Sub-Section (6) of Section 28 reads as under: 
“28. Appeal.– (1)……. 
(2)  ……… 
(3)  ……… 
(4)  ………. 
(5)  ……… 
(6)  The District Judge or the Additional District Judge 
may exercise any or all the powers of Rent Tribunal 
under this Act.” 
 (Emphasis supplied) 
The above quoted provision is somewhat similar to Section 15 of the 
Ordinance and sub-Section (5) thereof reads as under: 
15.  Appeal. —1)……… 
           (2)………. 
            (3)  ……… 
            (4)  ……… 
            “(5)  The appellate authority admitting an 
appeal for hearing shall have the same powers to direct 
the tenant to deposit the rent as are vested in the 
Controller under this Ordinance and, if the tenant makes 
default in compliance with such an order, then, if  he is 

9 
W.P. No.50434 of 2023 
 
 
the appellant, his appeal shall be dismissed summarily 
and, if he is the respondent, his defence shall be struck 
off”.  
      (Emphasis supplied) 
It is well evident that under sub-Section (5) of Section 15 of the 
Ordinance, the Appellate Court can only direct the tenant to deposit 
rent and not the “appellant”.  
15. 
While examining the scope of Section 15 of the Ordinance, the 
Supreme Court in case reported as “M. Imamuddin v. Surriya 
Khanum”(PLD 1991 SC 317) while referring to its earlier decisions 
held that the power of the Appellate Court must be considered co-
extensive with that of the Rent Controller. The analysis of various 
provisions of the Act in case of Mian Umar Ikram ul Haque supra by 
the Supreme Court is aptly applicable to sub-Section (6) of Section 28 
of the Act as well. Said provision of the Act affirms and reiterates the 
settled principle of law that the Appellate Court is vested with all the 
powers that can be exercised by the lower forum as appeal is 
continuation of the lis. This principle also applies to such powers which 
the Trial Court cannot exercise under the law, in terms of passing an 
interim order like the one under Section 24 of the Act, directing the 
respondent to deposit the rent due. If the Rent Tribunal is not vested 
with the power under Section 24 to direct deposit of the 
interim/tentative rent in case where the tenancy relationship is denied, 
then in terms of sub-Section (6) of Section 28 of the Act, while hearing 
the appeal, the same principle applies to the Appellate Court where the 
said respondent after losing before the Rent Tribunal, prefers an appeal 
against the final order of eviction that includes the rent payable as 
determined by the Rent Tribunal.  
16. 
Matter can be examined from another perspective. Once an 
eviction petition succeeds and the respondent therein prefers an appeal, 
the dispute in the appeal itself pertains as to whether the Rent Tribunal 

10 
W.P. No.50434 of 2023 
 
 
has rightly held that the tenancy exists between the parties. Sub-Section 
(6) of Section 28 by reference makes Section 24 of the Act applicable 
to the appeals, which has been predominantly interpreted in various 
cases that the Rent Tribunal has no power to pass the order to deposit 
tentative rent if the tenancy relationship is denied. The power of the 
Appellate Court in such matter co-exists with that of the Rent Tribunal 
as noted hereinabove. Needless to mention that the Appellate Court, in 
terms of sub-Section (4) of Section 28, can always dismiss the appeal 
in limine if after examining the final order passed by the Rent Tribunal 
and the record, if any, appended with the appeal, it reaches the 
conclusion that the denial of tenancy relationship was contumacious 
and the Rent Tribunal has rendered a just decision, which does not 
require any further probe and the issuance of notice to the ejectment 
petitioner is not necessary.  
17. 
Examining the matter from yet another angle, this Court is of the 
opinion that the Appellate Court while issuing notice and admitting the 
appeal should not pass an order directing the appellant (purported 
tenant) to deposit the arears of rent determined by the Rent Tribunal, 
along with monthly rent till pendency of the appeal as the same would 
lead to a self-defeating inference drawn by the Appellate Court 
inasmuch as on the one hand, the Appellate Court considers the case of 
the appellant to prima facie have some force and on the other hand, 
simultaneously burdening the appellant with deposit of arrears of rent 
and/or monthly rent in cases where the tenancy relationship is denied. 
Such contradictory and self-defeating inference is certainly not 
envisaged under sub-Section (6) of Section 28 of the Act read with 
Section 24 thereof. At this juncture, it is pertinent to observe that the 
legislature in its wisdom has provided for decision of an appeal, 
preferred under the Act, within prescribed period of 60-days in terms of 
sub-Section (7) of Section 28 thereof. In cases where the tenancy 
relationship is denied, significance of such time bound provision of the 

11 
W.P. No.50434 of 2023 
 
 
law gets accentuated, which is necessarily required to be strictly 
adhered by the Appellate Court, in order to ensure that rights of the 
landlord and/or the tenant do not hang in an uncertainty, for too long.   
18. 
In view of the above discussion, this petition has force and 
therefore, is allowed. The impugned order is set aside to the extent that 
the petitioner is not obligated to deposit the amount of arrears of rent as 
also the monthly rent during the pendency of the appeal in terms of the 
impugned order. It is expected that the Appellate Court will decide the 
appeal, within a period of one month from receipt of certified copy of 
this order and if need so arise, conduct day to day proceedings.
