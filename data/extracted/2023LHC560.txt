Muhammad Abu Sufyan  Versus  Additional District Judge etc.

Date of Hearing: 
06.02.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Babar Sultan Ahmad, 
Advocate.  
Respondent No.3 by: 
Mr. Raheel Jamil, Advocate.  
Anwaar Hussain, J.   The petitioner before this Court is 
judgment debtor in a suit instituted by respondent No.3 (“the 
respondent”) for recovery of her dowry articles. Through this 
constitutional petition, order dated 25.02.2022 passed by the learned 
Additional District Judge, Sahiwal has been assailed by virtue of which 
appeal preferred by the respondent has been accepted and her execution 
petition that was consigned to record by the learned Executing Court 
vide order dated 11.01.2022, has been restored with a direction that 
alternate value of the dowry articles be given to the respondent instead 
of the dowry articles, list whereof has been prepared by the local 
commission appointed by the learned Executing Court.  
2. 
By way of factual background, it is noted that the suit of the 
respondent was decreed on 26.04.2018 and the appeals preferred by both 
sides against the said judgment and decree were decided by the learned 
Appellate Court below on 10.10.2018. Appeal of the respondent was 
partly accepted where after the execution petition was filed by the 
respondent in which the petitioner was summoned and he was directed to 
submit surety bond and the needful was done accordingly. Thereafter, on 
13.04.2019, the learned Executing Court appointed its Reader as local 
commission for handing over the dowry articles, who submitted his 
report on 27.04.2019, which contemplates that the respondent has 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No.22694/2022

received some of the dowry articles and refused to receive the rest of the 
articles with the objection that the same have been changed and do not 
belong to her whereafter the learned Executing Court provided an 
opportunity to the parties to file objections. The respondent took the 
objection that since the dowry articles have been replaced, she is entitled 
to recover alternate price thereof but the said objection petition was 
dismissed by the learned Executing Court on 24.10.2019 and the said 
order, when assailed by the respondent in appeal, was upheld by the 
learned Appellate Court below, vide order dated 22.01.2020, against 
which no further proceedings were initiated by the respondent. 
Thereafter, the execution proceedings remained pending for one year 
and five months. In the meanwhile, the surety of the petitioner filed an 
application for his discharge on the ground that the respondent is not 
interested in getting her dowry articles, which was contested by the 
respondent and again she moved an application for recovery of alternate 
price of the dowry articles that was contested by the petitioner on legal 
as well as factual grounds and the learned Executing Court again 
dismissed the application of the respondent for recovery of alternate 
value of the dowry articles on 16.09.2021 and directed the respondent to 
receive her dowry articles. Order dated 16.09.2021 was not challenged 
by the respondent and the matter was repeatedly adjourned and 
ultimately, on 11.01.2022, the learned Executing Court consigned the 
execution petition to the record, with direction to the respondent to take 
her dowry articles from the house of the petitioner/judgment debtor 
within two months and issued robkar in the name of Nazir Civil for 
appointment of bailiff for return of dowry articles to the respondent. The 
respondent preferred appeal against order dated 11.01.2022, which was 
accepted and her execution proceedings have been restored, vide 
impugned order dated 25.02.2022. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that a local commission 
was appointed by the learned Executing Court, who had submitted his 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No.22694/2022 
 
 
 
3
report with regard to details of dowry articles whereupon twice the 
learned Executing Court passed detailed orders that the respondent can 
receive the dowry articles, most of which have been received by her, 
whereupon the execution petition was disposed of, however, the 
impugned order has been passed ignoring and/or without setting aside 
the said orders, which is illegal.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the 
dowry articles were replaced by the petitioner and the evidence in this 
regard was presented before the learned Appellate Court below, while 
arguing the appeal against order dated 11.01.2022 that has been correctly 
appreciated by learned Appellate Court below, therefore, the impugned 
order does not suffer from any infirmity. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
Factual matrix of the case is not denied by the respondent side. 
Admittedly, the executing proceedings remained pending since 
21.12.2018 and once the decree was passed and the execution 
proceedings were initiated, a list of dowry articles was prepared by the 
local commission appointed by the learned Executing Court. After 
receiving some of the articles, the respondent refused to accept the 
remaining articles on the ground that the same were changed, however, 
her objection was dismissed vide order dated 24.10.2019, operative para 
whereof is reproduced below:  
“08. It is pertinent to mention here that plaintiff herself 
opted to recover articles and she recovered the some of 
dowry articles laying (sic) in the house of judgment 
debtor/petitioner. It is quite astonishing that judgment 
debtor/petitioner offered or placed bona-fidely packed 
articles of the respondent/decree holder which clearly 
depicts that he had reightly (sic) placed the used articles of 
the decree holder for recovery. So, 
objection of 
petitioner/judgment debtor is considerable as he has same 
stance in the original suit that dowry articles of 
respondent/decree holder are laying in his house and he is 
ready to return the same to the then plaintiff/instant decree 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No.22694/2022

holder. Objection made by the respondent/decree holder 
that her dowry articles were laying in open courtyard when 
she went to recover the same from the judgment debtor’s 
house and same are not (sic) belong to her cannot be 
considered because she has not tendered even single proof 
which could establish that both judgment debtor and she 
had enjoyed or used the dowry articles according to her 
tendered pictures during their marital bliss. She has 
tendered her pictures wherein she can be seen only rather to 
tender the picture wherein both were present. In the light of 
above attended circumstances, stance of the judgment debtor 
is clear and strong, so objection petition is accepted and 
decree holder is directed to recover the same articles from the 
judgment debtor as he has placed or offered for recovery…..”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
Order dated 24.10.2019 was admittedly assailed in appeal and the same 
was upheld, vide order dated 22.01.2020 in the following terms:  
“7. 
I myself have perused the record of the case, i.e. plaint 
of suit filed by the appellant/decree holder, receipts of dowry 
articles tendered in her evidence in the suit, report of local 
commission and the pictures of the dowry articles lying in 
possession of the responded/judgment debtor tendered by 
the local commission with the report, pictures of the articles 
tendered by the appellant too and list of dowry articles 
submitted by the respondent/judgment debtor. When 
visualized in the above referred documents, it is observed 
that the remaining articles lying in possession of the 
respondent/judgment debtor are of the same description 
regarding their colour, brand and size etc. as mentioned in 
the receipt of dowry articles tendered by the appellant in her 
evidence in the suit. So far as the objection of the 
appellant/decree holder that the rest of the dowry articles 
lying in possession of the respondent are changed and do not 
actually belong to her is concerned, the appellant/decree 
holder has failed to produce any proof in order to establish 
her contention. Moreover, five years have been elapsed in 
marriage of the parties and it is natural that due to passage 
of time and use of the articles during subsistence of 
marriage, condition of the articles might have been 
deteriorated 
or 
damaged. 
Bonafide 
of 
the 
respondent/judgment debtor is also evident from the record 
that since inception of the litigation he admitted the claim of 
appellant/decree holder while stating that the dowry articles 
are lying are lying (sic) at his home in locked room, so it does 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No.22694/2022

not appeal to a prudent mind that he had replaced some of the 
articles instead of original belonging to the appellant/decree 
holder.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
Since it is admitted feature of the case that after passing of order dated 
22.01.2020, no further proceedings were initiated and the same attained 
finality, hence, the stance that the dowry articles have been replaced and 
the respondent is entitled to receive the alternate value thereof cannot be 
reagitated. Even, the second application for payment of alternate value 
of dowry articles was dismissed on 16.09.2021 and the said order was 
also not assailed. Perusal of the impugned order depicts that the learned 
Appellate Court below has not addressed the core issue as to how the 
respondent can be allowed to plead the same ground for the third time 
that she is entitled to recover alternate value of the dowry articles when 
her first application on the same subject was earlier dismissed vide order 
dated 24.10.2019 and upheld by the learned Appellate Court below vide 
order dated 22.01.2020 and, vide order dated 16.01.2019, the second 
application met with the same fate but no further proceedings were 
initiated by the respondent. When confronted with, learned counsel for 
the respondent could not controvert the said factual position, rather 
conceded that this aspect has not been dealt with by the learned 
Appellate Court below. 
7. 
It is settled principle that the Courts must aid the fair 
administration of justice by ensuring that litigation must come to an end 
by not allowing a litigant to agitate a particular ground and/or cause of 
action again and again, by filing successive applications, as the same 
amounts to abuse of process of law, causes hardship to the other side and 
runs counter to public policy that issue once decided and attained 
finality, cannot be reopened. Therefore, once order dated 24.10.2019 of 
the learned Executing Court was upheld by the learned Appellate Court 
below, the respondent cannot be allowed to agitate the same ground as 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No.22694/2022 
 
 
 
6
such a leverage to a litigant to file successive applications defeats the 
principle of public policy discussed hereinabove. On another plain, this 
Court is cognizant of the fact that in case the judgments of the learned 
Courts below are at variance, preference should be given to the judgment 
of the learned Appellate Court below, more particularly, in family 
matters as held in case reported as “Mst. Farah Naz v. Judge Family 
Court, Sahiwal and others” (PLD 2006 SC 457). However, in view of 
the above discussion, this is a fit case for interference in constitutional 
jurisdiction by this Court as the learned Appellate Court below has acted 
without appreciating the material available on record. In fact, the learned 
Appellate Court below acted in excess of jurisdiction inasmuch as by 
passing the impugned order, the learned Appellate Court below has 
reviewed its earlier order dated 22.01.2020 whereby the learned 
Appellate Court below upheld the order of the learned Executing Court 
dated 24.10.2019 dismissing the claim of the respondent to receive 
alternate value of dowry articles. Jurisdiction to review its earlier order 
is not vested with the learned Appellate Court below. Therefore, the 
impugned order cannot sustain.  
8. 
For what has been discussed above, this writ petition is allowed, 
impugned order of the learned Appellate Court below dated 25.02.2022 
is set aside and that of the learned Trial Court dated 11.01.2022 is 
restored with no order as to costs.
