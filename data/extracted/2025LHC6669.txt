Learned ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE and others 
 
 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. This petition in terms of Article 199 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 originates from 
the judgment dated 18th April, 2024, whereby learned Additional District 
Judge, Rawalpindi, while dismissing the revision application, filed by the 
petitioner, affirmed the order dated 13th March, 2024, passed by learned 
Civil Judge Class-I, Rawalpindi. 
2.  
Brief facts of the case, necessary for adjudication, are that the 
petitioner moved an application under Section 19 of the Punjab Rented 
Premises Act, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 2009”) before the 
learned Special Judge (Rent), Rawalpindi, seeking eviction of respondent 
No.3. The application was ex-parte allowed by way of order dated 08th 
December, 2023. In order to get the eviction order implemented, the 
petitioner filed an execution petition and during proceedings possession 
was delivered him. Feeling aggrieved, respondent No.4 (hereinafter 
referred to as “respondent”) moved an application under Section 12(2) of 
the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred to as 
Date of hearing: 
10.11.2025. 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Imran Shafiq, Advocate. 
Respondents No.3 by: 
Mr. Asad Abbasi, Advocate. 
 
Respondent No.4 by: 
Mr. Muhammad Shahid Kamal Khan, 
Advocate.

“CPC”), seeking annulment of the eviction order. The application was also 
accompanying an application for restoration of possession, which was 
allowed by way of order dated 13th March, 2024. Feeling dissatisfied, the 
petitioner though filed revision application under Section 115 of CPC, but 
it has been dismissed through the impugned judgment. 
3.   
Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the possession 
of the premises in question was handed over to the petitioner during the 
execution proceedings in a lawful manner. Maintained that the 
respondent, being aggrieved, moved an application under Section 12(2) 
of CPC and alongwith said application, an application for restoration of 
possession was also moved. Learned counsel submitted that said 
application, for all intents and purposes, was an application under Section 
144 of CPC but it has been allowed in an illegal and unlawful manner. 
Learned counsel emphasized that Section 144 of CPC has wrongly been 
invoked and the impugned order as well as judgment though are concurrent 
but are patently illegal. 
4.   
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent contended that 
the application was moved while invoking Order XXI, Rule 101 of CPC. 
He submitted that the application was quite competent and it was rightly 
allowed. Learned counsel contended with vehemence that concurrent 
findings are unexceptionable.  
5.   
Heard. Record perused. 
6.   
The petitioner claiming himself to be landlord of the premises in 
question, moved an application under Section 19 of the Act, 2009 against 
respondent No.3 before learned Special Judge (Rent), Rawalpindi. The 
application was allowed ex-parte by way of order dated 08th December, 
2023. This followed the execution proceedings, during pendency of which, 
possession of the premises in question was delivered to the petitioner. The 
respondent, however, feeling dissatisfied moved an application under 
Section 12(2) of CPC, seeking annulment of the eviction order. He also 
moved an application for restoration of possession on the basis whereof, 
the learned Civil Judge proceeded to restore possession to the respondent 
by way of order dated 13th March, 2024, which was even affirmed by the 
learned revisional court through the impugned judgment.

7.   
There is no cavil to the fact that the application for restoration of 
possession was accompanying an application under Section 12(2) of CPC 
and it was apparently moved in terms of Section 144 of CPC. For ready 
reference, same is reproduced below: - 
144. Application for restitution. -- (1) Where and in so far as 
a decree is varied or reversed the Court of first instance shall, 
on the application of any party entitled to any benefit by way of 
restitution or otherwise, cause such restitution to be made as 
will, so far as may be, place the parties in the position which they 
would have occupied but for such decree or such part thereof as 
has been varied or reversed; and, for this purpose, the Court 
may make any orders, including orders for the refund of costs 
and for the payment of interest, damages, compensation and 
mesne profits, which are properly consequential on such 
variation or reversal. 
(2) No suit shall be instituted for the purpose of obtaining any 
restitution or other relief which could be obtained by application 
under sub-section (1). 
From the bare perusal of above referred provision of law, it clearly 
manifests that if a decree is varied or reversed, on the basis whereof a party 
was divested from the property, the court of first instance on an application 
of such party can restore the possession and place the parties in the position 
which they would have occupied prior to passing of such decree. In the 
present case, the eviction order is still under scrutiny in terms of Section 
12(2) of CPC and there was no occasion to invoke Section 144 of CPC. 
Guidance to this effect can be sought from PARVAIZ, ETC. versus 
MUHAMMAD RAMZAN, ETC. (NLR 2009 Civil 317), relevant excerpt 
from the same is reproduced:- 
9. 
The concept of restitution is as old as the law itself. It 
becomes operative the very moment when the order under which 
a party to the litigation was deprived of his possession is varied, 
modified or set aside as it is ordained that the Court must remedy 
the injury or the wrong done to a party because of order of the 
Court. This section provides for procedure therefore, while the 
power to order restitution is inherent in Court, and should be 
exercised whenever justice demands. It is not a case of restoration 
of possession but of restitution of possession because order of 
dispossession of DDO (R) has been set aside by EDO (R) declaring 
the same to be illegal and without jurisdiction. 
8.   
So far contention of learned counsel for the respondent that the 
application was in fact in terms of Rule 101 of Order XXI of CPC; suffice 

4 
W.P.NO.1162 OF 2024 
 
 
 
to observe that the respondent may have several remedies, including the 
remedy provide under the Rule, ibid, but apparently, he opted to avail 
remedy under Section 12(2) of CPC and moved the miscellaneous 
application as part of said proceedings which for all intents and purposes 
was an application under Section 144 of CPC and was not proceedable in 
view of observations recorded, hereinabove, on account of clear and 
unequivocal mandate of Section 144 of CPC. Even otherwise, in view of 
settled principle of law that interim relief cannot be extended to a party in 
the form of final relief, learned Civil Judge Class-I, Rawalpindi, while 
allowing the application has transgressed his powers.  
9.   
Adverting to the stance of the respondent that the application 
was moved by invoking Order XXI, Rule 101 of CPC, it is observed, at 
the cost of repetition, that the respondent may have several remedies but 
on account of “doctrine of election”, he has to choose one of said 
remedies. It is trite law that the moment a party to lis intends to commence 
any legal proceeding to enforce any right and or invoke a remedy to set 
right a wrong or to vindicate an injury, he had to elect and or choose from 
amongst host of actions or remedies available under the law. The choice to 
initiate and pursue one out of host of available concurrent or co-existent 
proceedings/actions or remedy from a forum of competent jurisdiction 
vested with that party but when once choice was exercised and election 
was made then such party is precluded from launching another proceeding 
to seek a relief or remedy contrary to what would be claimed and or 
achieved by adopting other proceeding/action and or remedy, which in 
legal parlance is recognized as “doctrine of election”. The edifice of 
“doctrine of election” is structured and founded by the courts of law from 
the well-recognized principles of waiver and or abandonment of a known 
right, claim, privilege or relief as contained in Order II Rule 2 of the CPC, 
principles of estoppel as embodied in Article 114 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984 and principles of res judicata as enshrined in Section 11 of 
the CPC. To understand the object and scope of “doctrine of election” one 
can seek guidance from the principles laid down by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of TRADING CORPORATION OF PAKISTAN versus 

5 
W.P.NO.1162 OF 2024 
 
 
 
DEVAN SUGAR MILLS LIMITED and others (PLD 2018 Supreme Court 
828) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan has very elaborately outlined 
the scope of “doctrine of election” in the following words :- 
“8……..The moment suitor intends to commence any legal action 
to enforce any right and or invoke a remedy to set right a wrong or 
to vindicate an injury, he has to elect and or choose from amongst 
host of actions or remedies available under the law. The choice to 
initiate and pursue one out of host of available concurrent or co-
existent proceeding/ actions or remedy from a forum of competent 
jurisdiction vest with the suitor. Once choice is exercised and 
election is made then a suitor is prohibited from launching another 
proceeding to seek a relief or remedy contrary to what could be 
claimed and or achieved by adopting other proceeding/action and 
or remedy, which in legal parlance is recognized as doctrine of 
election, which doctrine is culled by the courts of law from the well-
recognized principles of waiver and or abandonment of a known 
right, claim, privilege or relief as contained in Order II, rule (2) 
C.P.C., principles of estoppel as embodied in Article 114 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 and principles of res-judicata as 
articulated in section 11, C.P.C. and its explanations. Doctrine of 
election apply both to the original proceedings/action as well to 
defences and so also to challenge the outcome on culmination of 
such original proceedings/ action, in the form of order or 
judgment/decree (for illustration it may be noted that multiple 
remedies are available against possible outcome in the form of an 
order/judgment/decree etc. emanating from proceedings of civil 
nature, which could be challenged/defended under Order IX, rule 13 
(if proceedings are ex-parte), section 47 (objection to execution), 
section 114 (by way of review of an order), section 115 (revision), 
under Order XXI, rules 99 to 103 C.P.C. and section 96 C.P.C. 
(appeal against the order/judgment) etc. Though there is no bar to 
concurrently invoke more than one remedy at the same time against 
an ex-parte order/judgment. However, once election or choice from 
amongst two or more available remedy is made and exhausted, 
judgment debtor cannot ordinarily be permitted subsequently to 
venture into other concurrently or coexisting available remedies. In 
a situation where an application under Order IX, rule 13, C.P.C. and 
also an application under section 12(2), C.P.C. seeking setting 
aside of an ex-parte judgment before the same Court and so also 
an appeal is filed against an ex-parte judgment before higher forum, 
all aimed at seeking substantially similar if not identical relief of 
annulment or setting aside of ex-parte order/judgment. Court 
generally gives such suitor choice to elect one of the many remedies 
concurrently 
invoked 
against 
one 
and 
same 
ex-parte 
order/judgment, as multiple and simultaneous proceedings may be 
hit by principle of res-subjudice (section 10, C.P.C.) and or where 
one of the proceeding is taken to its logical conclusion then other 
pending proceeding for the similar relief may be hit by principles of 
res-judicata. Giving choice to elect remedy from amongst several 
coexistent and or concurrent remedies does not frustrate or deny 
right of a person to choose any remedy, which best suits under the 

6 
W.P.NO.1162 OF 2024 
 
 
 
given circumstances but to prevent recourse to multiple or 
successive redressal of a singular wrong or impugned action before 
the competent forum/court of original and or appellate jurisdiction, 
such rule of prudence has been evolved by courts of law to curb 
multiplicity of proceedings. As long as a party does not avail of the 
remedy before a Court of competent jurisdiction all such remedies 
remain open to be invoked. Once the election is made then the party 
generally, cannot be allowed to hop over and shop for one after 
another coexistent remedies. In an illustrative case this court in the 
case of Mst.Fehmida Begum v. Muhammad Khalid and others 
(1992 SCMR 1908) encapsulated the doctrine of election as follows: 
"However, it is one thing to concede a power to the 
statutory forum to recall an order obtained from it by fraud, 
but another to hold that such power of adjudication or 
jurisdiction is exclusive so as to hold that a suit filed in a 
civil Court of general jurisdiction is barred. I am therefore 
in agreement with my brother that a stranger to the 
proceedings, in a case of this nature has two remedies 
open to him. He can either go to the special forum with an 
application to recall or review the order, or file a separate 
suit. Once he acts to invoke either of the remedies, he will, 
on the general principles to avoid a conflict of decisions, 
ultimately before the higher appellate forums, be deemed 
to have given up and forfeited his right to the other remedy, 
unless as held in Mir Salah-ud-Din v. Qazi Zaheer-ud-Din 
PLD 1988 SC 221, the order passed by the hierarchy of 
forums under the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 
leaves scope for approaching the Civil Court." 
9.  In the case of Behar State Co-operative Marketing Union 
Ltd. v. Uma Shankar Sharan and another [(1992) 4 Supreme 
Court Cases 196] Indian Supreme Court confronted with 
somewhat identical situation as to availability of plurality of 
remedies under a statute in paragraph No.6 at page 199 
concluded as follows: 
"6. Validity of plural remedies, if available under the law, 
cannot be doubted. If any standard book on the subject is 
examined, it will be found that the debate is directed to the 
application of the principle of election, where two or more 
remedies are available to a person. Even if the two 
remedies happen to be inconsistent, they continue for the 
person concerned to choose from, until he elects one of 
them, commencing an action accordingly." 
Reference to the above effect can also be made to JUBILEE GENERAL 
INSURANCE CO. LTD., KARACHI versus RAVI STEEL COMPANY, 
LAHORE (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 324). 
10.  
There is no cavil that normally this Court restrains itself to 
interfere with the concurrent findings of the courts below in exercise of 
constitutional jurisdiction but this is not an inflexible and absolute rule. The 
constitutional jurisdiction is meant to curb any illegality or perversity 

7 
W.P.NO.1162 OF 2024 
 
 
 
resulting into abuse of process of law. Though there are concurrent findings 
but in the light of discussion, noted hereinabove, it can safely be inferred 
that same are tainted with patent illegalities. 
11.  
For the foregoing reasons, instant petition is allowed and 
findings of the learned Additional District Judge as well as learned Civil 
Judge Class-I, Rawalpindi, rendered through judgment dated 18th April, 
2024 and order dated 13th March, 2024, are set-aside. No order as to costs.
