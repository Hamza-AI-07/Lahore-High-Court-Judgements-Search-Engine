Date of Hearing: 
04.09.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Ch. Mahmood-ur-Rehman, 
Advocate. 
Respondents No.3 to 5 
by: 
Mr. 
Ghulam 
Fareed 
Sanotra, Advocate.  
       
Anwaar Hussain, J. Respondents No. 3 to 5 (“the 
respondents”) instituted a suit against the petitioner, for dissolution of 
marriage of respondent No.3 with the petitioner as also for recovery of 
her dowry articles as well as the maintenance of respondents No.4 and 
5 (“the minors”) who are real children of the petitioner born from his 
wedlock with respondent No.3. Through an ex-parte judgment and 
decree dated 03.04.2018, the suit was decreed, where-after execution 
proceedings were initiated by the respondents. The petitioner did make 
some payments, however, on 13.02.2019, respondent No.3 got 
recorded her statement that she does not want to proceed with the 
execution petition and the matter was consigned to the record. 
However, subsequently, on 10.05.2019, the execution proceedings 
were restored on the application of the respondents. Thereafter, on 
21.06.2019, after issuing warrant of attachment of the property of the 
petitioner, auction schedule was chalked out on 20.07.2019 while 
calculating the decretal amount till the year 2035. Thereafter the 
property was auctioned. Respondent No.3 purchased the said property,

as recorded in order dated 25.11.2019 passed by the Executing Court, 
by adjusting the amount of maintenance, which was calculated by 
considering the future maintenance amount, of the minors, till 2032.  
2. 
The petitioner assailed order dated 20.07.2019 by way of filing 
an application under Section 12(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908 (“CPC”), inter alia, with the averments that the execution 
petition was earlier withdrawn by the respondents on 13.02.2019, 
which had been restored, subsequently, without serving any notice 
upon the petitioner; that his property was attached without fulfilment of 
legal formalities; and that the decretal amount was wrongly assessed 
till 2032 that is also not permissible under the law. The application of 
the petitioner was dismissed by the Executing Court, vide impugned 
order dated 31.03.2021 against which the petitioner filed a revision 
petition that was also dismissed by the learned Additional District 
Judge, Chiniot, vide judgment dated 28.01.2022. Hence, this 
constitutional petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that after the 
execution petition was consigned to the record, no notice was issued 
for its restoration and hence, the entire execution proceedings are 
nullity in the eyes of law, particularly, given the fact that prior to 
consigning the execution petition to record, the petitioner had been 
making payment(s) in order to satisfy the decree. Adds that it was 
mandatory on part of the Executing Court that notices under Order XXI 
Rule 66 of the CPC should have been issued before putting the 
property of the petitioner to auction, however, needful has not been 
done. Concludes that the Court Auctioneer, instead of acting as per the 
auction schedule chalked out by the Executing Court, has himself opted 
to postpone the auction, which was later on held on 23.10.2019 instead 
of 18.09.2019, as ordered by the Executing Court, and this fact alone 

 
 
W.P. No.25771 of 2022                                                                                      3 
 
 
 
 
merits interference by this Court. Voluntarily states that the petitioner 
is willing and ready to pay the entire amount of maintenance due in 
favour of the minors, as of today.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents submits that 
even if there are irregularities in the auction proceedings, the petitioner 
was obligated to deposit 20% of the decretal amount in compliance of 
Order XXI Rule 90 of the CPC, which he failed to do despite direction 
by the Executing Court and hence, the learned Court has rightly passed 
the impugned order and in compliance of the same, the sale deed has 
been executed in favour of respondent No.3 and the matter has become 
past and closed transaction. Places reliance upon “Mst. Kalsoom Malik 
and others v. Assistant Commissioner and others” (1996 SCMR 710) 
and “Messrs Habib and Company and others v. Muslim Commercial 
Bank Limited and others” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 227) in support 
of his contention. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
Admittedly, the decree passed in the suit instituted by the 
respondents has attained finality which is required to be executed and 
satisfied. However, it is the process adopted and the extent to which the 
decretal amount has been calculated by the Executing Court that has 
been called into question by the petitioner. The petitioner has put forth 
the contest that the auction proceedings are nullity on account of 
procedural irregularities committed by the Executing Court as also the 
Court Auctioneer whereas it is the case of the respondents that even if 
the said auction is marred by procedural irregularities, the same could 
have only been examined, if the petitioner had deposited the amount 
directed by the Executing Court and since the said direction has not 
been complied with, therefore, the petitioner is not entitled to any 
relief.  Record depicts that the petitioner also filed applications, inter 

 
 
W.P. No.25771 of 2022                                                                                      4 
 
 
 
 
alia, to clear the arrears of maintenance in installments but said 
applications were dismissed vide order dated 26.03.2022 that reads as 
under: 
“12. Perusal of record reveals that when execution 
petition was filed it was mentioned at column No.8 of the 
form of execution petition that Rs.14250/- has been paid 
as the interim maintenance allowance before the learned 
Judge Family Court. Later on, during execution 
proceedings Rs.20000/- was paid on 29.09.2018 and 
Rs.20000/- on 15.10.2018. Subsequently, judgment 
debtor has paid Rs.2,00,000/- on 10.02.2022. In this way 
judgment debtor has paid Rs.254250/- in cash. On 
25.11.2019, after the auction proceedings when sale 
certificate was issued, Rs.26,00,000/- has been adjusted 
in terms of decretal amount. In this ways, till today 
judgment debtor has paid (Rs.2,54,250 + Rs.26,00,000 
=Rs.28,54,250/-). 
13. 
Decree holder has calculated the decree money 
till the year 2034 at the time of the issuance of auction 
schedule. If the calculation of the decree holder is 
considered then the decretal amount till 29.02.2032 is 
Rs.28,44,000/-. The remaining amount Rs.10250/- shall 
be adjusted in the maintenance due on 29.03.2032 and 
on that day judgment debtor would pay only Rs.12750/- 
to the decree holders. In this way, the whole decree 
money and auction money shall be adjusted in 
compliance of the decree dated 29.03.2018.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
7. 
Record further depicts that an amount of approximately 
Rs.340,000/-, inter alia, on account of arrears of maintenance was 
outstanding when the execution was filed. As reflected in the order dated 
26.03.2022, the petitioner did make substantial payments albeit irregularly 
and not in time. However, instead of recovering the amount due till the 
date of attachment and/or the auction, the arrears of maintenance have 
been calculated till year 2032 by considering annual increase that was  
yet to accrue and the same has been deemed to be the arrears of 
maintenance and the decree has been executed by auction of property 

 
 
W.P. No.25771 of 2022                                                                                      5 
 
 
 
 
of the petitioner, which has been purchased by respondent No.3/mother 
of the minors. Thus, the analysis of the factual matrix of the case entails 
the following questions to be answered by this Court: 
i) 
Whether the future maintenance could be 
anticipated to remain unpaid and notionally deemed as 
arrears of maintenance? 
ii) 
Whether the procedure adopted by the court 
auctioneer suffers from the material procedural 
irregularities? 
iii. 
Whether the petitioner was required to comply 
with the condition precedent of deposit of 20% of the 
auction price to get the same set aside as directed by the 
learned Executing Court when such an order was based 
on calculation of arrears having no legal backing? 
8. 
Taking up the first question, it is imperative to note that 
maintenance of the children is the obligation of every father who is 
morally, socially and legally bound to pay such a living expense in 
order to provide food, clothing, education and other necessities of life, 
in accordance with his financial resources. Failure to pay maintenance 
may constrain a minor, through a guardian/mother, to have recourse to 
institution of suit and that is usually decreed and certain amount is 
determined and awarded by the Courts, alongwith annual increase. The 
purpose is to maintain a minor by provision of the necessities of life 
such as food, clothing and education etc., which necessarily implies 
that the same are to be fulfilled as and when the same arise. One cannot 
lose sight of the fact that the needs of the minor as well as the financial 
resources of the father may undergo change. Any such change may be 
brought before the Court for the refixation and re-determination of the 
maintenance as held in case reported as “Samia Anwar and another v. 
Nasir Hussain and 2 others” (2022 MLD 731). If regular maintenance 
is not paid despite being decreed, the same becomes arrears of 
maintenance that can be enforced through different modes adopted for 

 
 
W.P. No.25771 of 2022                                                                                      6 
 
 
 
 
the execution of the decree. Thus, it is the failure of the father to make 
payment of maintenance for a particular period which renders the same 
recoverable as arrears. This necessarily implies that arrears are with 
respect to the past period and maintenance for a future period cannot be 
notionally deemed as arrears as it is the crucial aspect of failure to 
make payment of maintenance decreed that transforms the same into 
arrears. As further explication, maintenance is a debt which becomes 
due when a minor is not maintained at a particular period and it is 
passage of that time period coupled with the failure to pay the decretal 
amount, which transforms the said obligation into arrears. Maintenance 
of a time period which is yet to arrive cannot be considered as arrears 
as the fundamental and pivotal condition of failure to maintain cannot 
be anticipated in advance inasmuch as there is every likelihood that the 
father (in this case the petitioner) fulfils his obligation to maintain the 
minor when said obligation arises in future. Therefore, the notional 
conversion of future maintenance of a future period into arrears of 
decretal amount, as done in the instant case while calculating and 
recovering the maintenance till year 2032, cannot be countenanced, 
under the law.   
9. 
Insofar as the question regarding the material irregularities in 
auction proceedings is concerned, suffice to observe that admittedly 
when the auction schedule was chalked out, no place of auction as well 
as time of auction was mentioned in order dated 20.07.2019. Moreover, 
the auction was to be held on 18.09.2019 as directed by the Executing 
Court, however, admittedly, the same was not conducted on the said 
date. There is nothing available on record to substantiate that the Court 
Auctioneer sought the permission of the Executing Court to reschedule 
the auction for any future date. This fact alone indicates that the auction 
proceedings were not carried out in accordance with law and as per the 
schedule chalked out by the Executing Court. Rather, the auction 

 
 
W.P. No.25771 of 2022                                                                                      7 
 
 
 
 
proceedings were conducted by the Court Auctioneer on his own, on 
23.10.2019, without seeking permission of the Court. Without 
addressing irregularities committed by the Court Auctioneer, the 
Executing Court has non-suited the petitioner, merely, on the ground 
that since he has neither paid regular monthly maintenance to the 
minors nor assailed the order of attachment of his property, therefore, 
he is not entitled to any relief. In this regard, it is imperative to note 
that even the said inappropriate conduct on part of the petitioner does 
not empower the Executing Court to confirm an auction that was not 
conducted in accordance with the just and equitable principles. This is 
more so when the decree has been executed for future maintenance that 
was neither due nor permissible under the law.  
10. 
Insofar as the third and the most crucial question as to whether the 
deposit of 20% of the sale price was a condition precedent to maintain 
an application for setting aside of sale through auction by the Executing 
Court is concerned, it would be pertinent to observe that the decree in 
favour of the respondents has been passed by the Trial Court under the 
West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 (the Act, 1964”) that excludes 
the applicability of the CPC and Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (“the 
QSO”). The Family Court is not bound by the procedural technicalities 
of the CPC as envisaged by Section 17 of the Act, 1964. The Family 
Court is vested with the power to formulate its own procedure. The 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case reported as “Farzana Rasool and 3 
others v. Dr. Muhammad Bashir Ahmad and others” (2011 SCMR 
1361) held that the object of the Act, 1964 was to shorten the agony of 
litigants and provide them speedy justice. It was also held therein that 
the object and purpose of exclusion of applicability of the CPC and  
QSO was to avoid technicalities by providing short, simple                  
and speedy methodology for settlement of disputes. Thus, the           
necessary  condition   incorporated  under  Order  XXI  Rule  90  of   the  

 
 
W.P. No.25771 of 2022                                                                                      8 
 
 
 
 
CPC for deposit of certain percentage of the sale price is not 
applicable to the proceedings before the Family Court, which makes 
the application for setting aside the auction proceedings, though such 
an application in the instant case has been filed under Section 12(2) 
of the CPC, maintainable. Needless to mention that wrong 
mentioning of a provision of law makes no difference if the order or 
the proceedings challenged are nullity in the eye of law and this 
Court in its supervisory jurisdiction can rectify such an error and 
mould the relief claimed in order to ensure justice. As has been held 
above that the future maintenance cannot be considered to be part of 
an amount payable under the decree, without the same becoming due 
and then transforming into arrears on account of default of the 
petitioner/judgment debtor, such recovery of arears in itself was not 
recoverable/executable, therefore, the sale of the property effected in 
execution thereof cannot sustain and all subsequent proceedings 
carried out also fall to the ground.  
11. 
There is another angle from which the case can be examined. 
The fact that the property of the petitioner auctioned has been 
purchased by the respondent No.3 herself further goes onto reflect 
the arm-twisting at play, instead of the fair and just desire, to make 
the petitioner pay the maintenance of the minors, which is also 
evident from the fact that earlier the execution had been withdrawn 
and was later on got revived and execution proceedings were carried 
out without notice to the petitioner. This fact alone establishes that 
the petitioner was condemned unheard from the outset of restoration 
of the execution proceedings. The fact that notice was not issued to 
the petitioner when respondents filed an application to revive the 
execution proceedings is substantiated by learned Counsel for the 
petitioner by producing certified copy of application to procure the 
attested copies  (naql form). Report on the said naql form by the 

 
 
W.P. No.25771 of 2022                                                                                      9 
 
 
 
 
record keeper of the Executing Court depicts that there is neither 
mentioning of issuance of notice under Order XXI Rule 66 of the 
CPC in the order sheet of the Executing Court nor such notices are 
available on record. Meaning thereby that when the execution petition 
was revived, no notices were served upon the petitioner, therefore, the 
sale of the property belonging to the petitioner through auction cannot 
sustain as it offends principle of audi alteram partem. The said 
certified copy of naql form has been taken on record as ‘Mark-A’. 
12. 
Moreover, both technical aspects as well as the merits of the case 
aside, the case turns on another important aspect as well. There is no 
cavil to the proposition that the petitioner, as father of the minors, is 
obligated to maintain the latter and the arrears of maintenance once 
recovered during the execution proceedings are to be used for the 
benefits of the minors by fulfilling necessities of life, however, in the 
instant case, the future maintenance has been calculated till year 2032 
and respondent No.3/mother has adjusted the said amount against 
purchase price of the property belonging to the petitioner in her own 
name. Particularly, this leaves the minors again with no maintenance. 
This Court while exercising the parental jurisdiction is perturbed from 
such state of affairs that on failure of the petitioner/father to maintain 
the minors, on the one hand, the former has been deprived of his 
property, which may form the inheritance of the minors in future and 
on the other hand, the same has not been transferred in the names of the 
minors, rather admittedly, sale deed in favour of respondent 
No.3/mother has been executed. Hence, it is the minors who are on the 
losing side in both eventualities.  
13. 
Before parting with, suffice to note that the reliance of the 
respondent side on cases of Kalsoom Malik and Habib and Company , 
supra is misconceived as said cases do not relate to the family matters 

 
 
W.P. No.25771 of 2022                                                                                      10 
 
 
 
 
which are special proceedings under a special law that specifically 
excludes the applicability of the CPC and QSO. The Supreme Court in 
“Hudaybia Textile Mills Ltd and others v. Allied Bank of Pakistan Ltd 
and others” (PLD 1987 SC 512) while interpreting the interplay of 
CPC and Banking Companies (Recovery of Loans) Ordinance, 1979 
(“the Ordinance, 1979”) observed that in case of any repugnancy 
between the CPC and the Ordinance, 1979, the latter would override to 
the extent of repugnancy. On the basis of same principle, the provisions 
of the CPC having been excluded by the Act, 1964 are inapplicable to 
the proceedings before the Family Court. 
14. 
In view of the above, this petition is allowed and the sale of the 
disputed property is held to be illegal and thus set aside. However, the 
petitioner, on whose behalf it has been voluntarily submitted before this 
Court that the arrears of decretal amount including monthly 
maintenance, as of today will be cleared, is directed to make payment 
of an amount of Rs.1,000,000/- (Rupees One Million), with the learned 
Executing Court, within 30-days from the date of receipt of certified 
copy of this order, and the said amount shall be adjusted against the 
arrears of decretal amount including monthly maintenance due till that 
date. In case the petitioner fails to deposit an amount of Rs.1,000,000/- 
(Rupees One Million) as directed hereinabove, this order shall be 
deemed to be recalled and the present petition shall be deemed to have 
been dismissed. No order as to costs.
