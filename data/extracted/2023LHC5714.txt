ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J: This constitutional Petition 
questions the validity of Orders dated 05.07.2022 and 18.07.2022 
passed by Circle Registrar (Housing), Cooperative Societies Punjab, 
Lahore and Secretary Cooperatives, Government of the Punjab, 
respectively.  
2. 
 
Precisely, State Life Insurance Employees Cooperative 
Housing Society Limited (the “Petitioner-Society”) is a membership 
based cooperative housing society registered under Section 10 of the 
Cooperative Societies Act, 1925 (the “Act”) read with Cooperatives 
Societies Rules, 1927 (the “Rules”) framed under Section 71 of the Act. 
Each of its member holds membership by way of a share purchase and 
is granted the right to occupy at least one plot or housing unit in the 
Petitioner-Society with the objective to pool the resources of the 
members to leverage their buying power, thus, lowering the cost per 
member in terms of all the facilities and services associated with 
ownership. The Petitioner-Society is run by its Managing Committee in 
accordance with its by-laws duly approved by the Registrar,

W.P. No. 45114 / 2022 
 
 
Cooperatives subject to the provisions of the Act and the Rules. The 
supreme authority of the Petitioner-Society in terms of Section 18-A of 
the Act read with its by-law 22 vests in its General Body. The 
Cooperatives Department of the Government of the Punjab through the 
Registrar and Secretary Cooperatives regulates the Petitioner-Society 
under the Act and the Rules. 
3. 
 
The Petitioner-Society consists of two separate phases 
called Phase-I and Phase-II. The total number of members of Phase-I 
and Phase-II are statedly about 3313 and 7360, respectively. Phase-I of 
the Petitioner-Society is developed but Phase-II comprising of 
approximately 4800-Kanals could not be completely developed since 
2003 as allegedly the land is not in a compact block but exists in 
scattered pockets. In Special General Meeting (the “SGM”) held in the 
year 2015-2016, it was resolved to completely develop Phase-II of the 
Petitioner-Society by proportionately reducing different category of 
plots but such efforts did not materialize. The Petitioner-Society in 
order to resolve the long-standing issue of non-development of Phase-II 
decided to place the same in its Annual General Meeting (the “AGM”) 
which is also a mandatory statutory obligation on yearly basis. In this 
context, an application seeking permission to hold the AGM on 
06.03.2022 was filed before the Registrar which was allowed vide 
Order dated 14.02.2022. However, the said Order was challenged by 
some members of the Petitioner-Society including Respondent No. 6 
and in consequence thereof, vide Order dated and 03.03.2022 passed by 
the Secretary Cooperatives, the relevant agenda items with respect to 
the fate of Phase-II of the Petitioner-Society were ordered to be dropped 
and directed to be taken up separately through the SGM primarily on 
the ground that the issue of non-development of plots in Phase-II is 
liable to be resolved separately by the members of Phase-II only. 
Thereafter, the Petitioner-Society, Respondent No. 6 and another filed 
Writ Petition Nos. 13488, 13421 and 13490 of 2022 which were 
dismissed by this Court by refusing to interfere in the Order dated 
03.03.2022 passed by the Secretary Cooperatives.

W.P. No. 45114 / 2022 
 
 
4. 
 
Resultantly, the Petitioner-Society decided to convene the 
SGM on 27.03.2022 with a specific agenda to either develop Phase-II 
through the developer and handover the plots to its members or sell the 
land of Phase-II and distribute the proceeds of sale amongst the 
members of Phase-II. The holding of the SGM was again assailed on 
multiple grounds by some members of the Petitioner-Society but the 
Registrar allowed the convening of the SGM vide Order dated 
18.03.2022. In further challenge to the said Order, the Secretary 
Cooperatives vide Order dated 25.03.2022 held that the proposed SGM 
has been convened without following specified procedure and therefore, 
directed that a fresh SGM be convened at a later stage after fulfilling all 
legal and procedural requirements. After successfully coping with 
aforesaid 
obstacles, 
eventually, 
the 
Petitioner-Society 
sought 
permission for holding the SGM on 24.07.2022 from the Registrar 
which was granted vide impugned Order dated 05.07.2022 subject to 
SOPs dated 27.11.2020 (the “SOPs”) and following directions issued 
under Section 44-D of the Act:- 
“1) 
The Managing Committee of the society will 
devise proposals/decisions in such a way that it 
falls strictly under Cooperative Societies Act, 
1925 and Cooperative Societies Rules, 1927 so 
that this office may proceed further accordingly. 
2)  
Agenda points and proposals must be presented 
in a detailed, tangible and unambiguous manner, 
enabling the members to reach a concrete 
decision. 
3)  
Quorum is fixed at 33% of total members of 
Phase-II. In case the presence of Phase-Il 
members is less than 33%, the SGM shall be 
adjourned for maximum period of two hours. In 
case quorum still remains below 33%, SGM will 
be postponed. 
4)  
Attendance of participants should be marked and 
enrolled in a transparent and verifiable manner. 
5)  
Voting on the agenda points shall be conducted 
by way of clear division instead of mere show of 
hands. 
6)  
The resolution(s) must be approved with 2/3rd 
majority of present members instead of simple 
majority. 
In order to monitor above referred SGM, 
following 
officers 
are 
deputed 
as 
departmental 
representative / observer to attend the SGM on fixed

date and time and submit report regarding its 
proceedings. 
1.  Mr. Moazzam Ali Butt, Deputy Registrar Cooperative 
Societies, Lahore. 
2.  Rana Sajid Ali, Deputy Registrar, Cooperative 
Societies Rawalpindi. 
The proceedings of the Special General Meeting 
shall remain subject to final approval of this office in the 
light of revised SOPS for holding of SGM of

directions as referred above.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       (underlining is mine) 
5. 
 
The Petitioner-Society being aggrieved from directions 
No. 3 and 6 reproduced above instituted Revision Petition before the 
Secretary Cooperatives, inter alia, on the grounds that the same are 
inconsistent to its by-law 23 which specifies quorum and requires 
decisions to be taken by simple majority of its members, present and 
voting. As such, the directions being inconsistent with statutory 
provisions and by-laws of the Petitioner-Society are arbitrary, 
unreasonable and capricious. However, the Revision was dismissed by 
the Secretary Cooperatives vide impugned Order dated 18.07.2022. 
Hence, this Petition. 
6. 
 
The respective contentions of the parties have been heard 
and record perused. 
7. 
 
The permission for holding the SGM was sought by the 
Petitioner-Society for consideration of the following agenda by the 
members of Phase-II of the Petitioner-Society: 
 
 
Discussion and decision about fate / future of Phase-II. 
(a) Discussion and decision as to whether Phase-II will be 
developed by the Petitioner-Society; or 
(b) Plots will be developed through developer and handed 
over to members of Phase-II; or 
(c) Auction of land of Phase-II and funds to be returned to 
the members.  
8. 
 
This Court in exercise of its power of judicial review is 
called upon to examine the validity of directions No. 3 and 6 imposed 
by the Registrar with reference to the above agenda of the SGM in the 

5 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 45114 / 2022 
 
 
light of the provisions of the Act, the Rules, the by-laws of the 
Petitioner-Society and the SOPs. It is universally accepted and equally 
well entrenched in our jurisprudence that in the scheme of regulation, 
the provisions of law prevail in case of any inconsistency with any 
provision in the constituting document of a corporate body. Further, the 
constituting document of a corporate entity, if approved by the regulator 
under the law, also derives statutory recognition provided it is not 
inconsistent with direct statutory stipulations. This principle is 
reiterated in Rule 52(1) of the Rules. Similarly, the Regulator, if 
permitted by law can issue directions within the ambit and scope of law 
in discharge of duties of regulation.  
9. 
 
The Act was promulgated with the objective to allow the 
formation, registration and regulation of cooperative societies for the 
promotion of thrift, self-help and mutual assistance among persons with 
common economic or social interests to enhance their standard of 
living. Like any other typical corporate structure, the Act and the Rules 
provide a comprehensive and complete frame-work regarding the 
formation, operation, regulation and winding-up of a cooperative 
society. The Cooperative Department of the Government of the Punjab 
is tasked with the regulation of cooperative societies through the office 
of the Registrar with some supervisory powers vested in the Secretary 
Cooperatives. Under Section 3(aa) read with Section 3(e) of the Act, a 
cooperative society and its by-laws require compulsory registration. 
Rule 5 of the Rules provides that the by-laws of a society submitted 
under Section 9(3) of the Act shall subject to any modification 
approved by the Registrar and adopted in the General Meeting, having a 
quorum, by majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present 
and voting at such meeting, become the by-laws of the society. 
Similarly, Section 16 of the Act allows for amendments in the by-laws 
of a society. Elaborating the process, Rule 6(2) of the Rules requires 
that a resolution for alteration or abrogation of the by-laws of a society 
is required to be passed by majority of not less than two-thirds of the 
members present at the general meeting at which a quorum shall be 

6 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 45114 / 2022 
 
 
present or, at an adjourned meeting at which quorum is not present, 
members present shall form the quorum. Moreover, Section 16-A of the 
Act also confer powers upon the Registrar to effect amendments in the 
by-laws of a society. Section 13 of the Act ordains that SGM may be 
called at any time by a majority of the members of Management 
Committee and shall be called within one month on the requisition in 
writing of one-fifth of the members of a society or at the instance of the 
Registrar. Section 18-A of the Act unequivocally declares that the 
powers and management of a society shall vest in its General Body 
consisting of all of its members. A society shall have a Managing 
Committee, constituted in accordance with its rules and the by-laws, 
which shall exercise such powers and functions as may be delegated to 
it by the General Body. Subject to any general or special order of the 
Government, the Registrar may, on such terms and conditions as he 
may deem fit, appoint not more than two experts on the Managing 
Committee of a society for the development and proper management of 
the society. Importantly, Section 18-A(4) confers a power to the 
Registrar to require a society to obtain approval of its General Body, in 
any matter concerning the business of the society, before proceeding 
further in the matter. Rule 6-A of the Rules provides that 
notwithstanding anything contained in the Rules or by-laws of a society 
as to the manner of summoning a General Meeting and a notice to be 
given, for the said purpose, any person authorized in this behalf by the 
Registrar may call the SGM for which a requisition has been made 
under Section 13(2) of the Act in such manner and at such time and 
place as the Registrar may direct. It further states that such a convened 
SGM shall have powers to transact all business which can be transacted 
at an AGM under the by-laws of the society and such other business as 
is specifically mentioned in the requisition made by the Registrar. 
Section 15 of the Act deals with amalgamation and division of societies 
which eclipses the powers of the General Body through conditions 
precedent of taking prior approval of the Registrar and a resolution 
passed by two-third majority of the members present and voting in the 

7 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 45114 / 2022 
 
 
AGM or the SGM. The specific obligation for adopting a resolution by 
two-third majority of the members present and voting in the AGM or 
the SGM also finds mention in some other Sections of the Act such as 
Section 15-A which deals with merger of a society in a company and 
Section 47 relating to winding up of a society. Chapter VII of the Act 
deals with inspection in the affairs of a society and confers broad and 
sweeping powers to the Registrar with respect to inquiries, inspection of 
books and properties, removal of officers, giving of directions, taking of 
special measures and redressal of grievances of members. The 
impugned directions have been purportedly issued by the Registrar by 
invoking Section 44-D of the Act which is couched in Chapter VII of 
the Act and is reproduced as under:-   
“44-D. Power of Registrar to give directions. Where the 
Registrar is satisfied that in the public interest or to 
prevent the affairs of any society from being conducted 
in a manner detrimental to the interest of its members or 
depositors of the society or to secure the proper 
management of any society generally, it is necessary to 
issue directions to the societies generally or to any 
society in particular, it may issue necessary directions 
and the societies or as the case may be the society shall 
be bound to comply with such directions.”  
 
10. 
 
Conspicuously, there is no provision in the Act or the 
Rules specifying quorum for a society with respect to the AGM or the 
SGM, thus, leaving the issue of quorum to be stipulated in the by-laws 
of a society. Therefore, it is imperative to analyze the current applicable 
model by-laws of the Petitioner-Society which were adopted by the 
General Body of the Petitioner-Society in its AGM held on 29.01.2017 
and approved by the Registrar on 29.11.2019. By-law 4(2)(iii) provides 
that any amendment or alteration / change in the housing scheme will 
be subject to the decision of General Meeting and the Registrar. In line 
with statutory dictates, by-law 22 proclaims that the supreme authority 
of the Petitioner-Society shall vest in the General Meeting. AGM shall 
be held between 1st July to 30th September each year and if the same is 
not called within the fixed time, the Registrar shall call it. SGM can be 
summoned at any time as prescribed in Section 13 of the Act and if 
summoned by the Registrar or at the written request of not less than 

8 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 45114 / 2022 
 
 
1/5th of the total members, it will be called within one month. By-law 
23 stipulates that to decide any matter, the following quorum shall be 
required: 
 
NO. OF MEMBERS 
QUORUM REQUIRED 
1. 
1 to 100 
30% 
2. 
101 to 200 
40 members 
3. 
201 to 500 
20% 
4. 
501 to 700 
100 members 
5. 
701 to 1000 
15%

150 members 
7. 
1501 to 2000 
10%  
8. 
2001 and above 
250 members 
 
In case quorum of the General Meeting is not complete, the AGM will 
be postponed for one hour and after one hour, the AGM will again be 
called for which members present shall form a quorum. By-law 26 
further clarifies that except otherwise provided in the Act, the Rules or 
the By-laws, all matters will be decided by simple majority but in case 
of equality, the President will have a casting vote. By-law 29 
specifically deals with the amendment in the by-laws and stipulates that 
any amendment shall be carried out by two-third majority of the 
members present at a General Meeting at which a quorum shall be 
present or at an adjourned General Meeting in which if a quorum is not 
present, the members present will form the quorum. This is subject to 
the condition that at least 15 days of notice of the amendment is given 
to all the members through the press and post. It further stipulates that 
no amendment passed in the General Meeting will be enforceable 
unless it is approved and registered by the Registrar. By-law 30(10) 
stipulates that General Meeting is competent to consider any matter 
referred to it by the President or Managing Committee or the Registrar. 
As per by-law 34(8) read with by-law 34(1)(c), any change in allotted 
plots to the members or any amendment in increase or decrease in 
housing scheme by the Management Committee is subject to the 
approval of General Meeting and the Registrar. By-law 34(38) binds the 
Management Committee to do any other act necessary for the 
achievement of objects of the Petitioner-Society or required by the 
General Meeting or the Registrar.

11. 
 
In case titled, “Military Accounts Co-operative Housing 
Society Ltd. versus Secretary to the Government of the Punjab and 
others” (PLD 2016 Lahore 223), the power of the Registrar to issue 
directions under Section 44 of the Act were recognized with the caveat 
that such directions are amenable to judicial review by the Court in the 
light of discretionary parameters of Section 44-D of the Act vis-à-vis 
the express statutory commands enshrined in the Act, the Rules and the 
by-laws in order to draw a balance between the democratic and 
independent character of a cooperative society and the extent of 
interference into its affairs by the regulator.  
12. 
 
It follows from the cumulative and conjunctive reading of 
the scheme of law encapsulated in the provisions of the Act, the Rules 
and the by-laws that vast and broad powers are conferred upon the 
Registrar to regulate the affairs of a cooperative society and has powers 
to issue specific directions in the public interest or to prevent the affairs 
of any society from being conducted in a manner detrimental to the 
interest of its members or depositors of the society or to secure the 
proper management of any society. Such power of the regulator is well 
recognized by the by-laws of the Petitioner-Society. However, it is 
equally well settled that such discretionary powers have to be exercised 
and structured within the ambit of scheme of law to advance the 
objectives of regulation and must not be exercised arbitrarily, 
unreasonably or capriciously to undermine the democratic and 
independent decision-making by the members of a cooperative society. 
It is obvious that a specific quorum has been stipulated in the by-laws 
of the Petitioner-Society which has been duly approved by the 
Registrar. All General Meetings are being conducted accordingly and as 
such, there was no compelling reason available to the Registrar and the 
Secretary Cooperatives to disregard the same and prescribe a mandatory 
supra-quorum requirement inconsistent with designated quorum in the 
by-laws undermining the democratic and independent functioning of 
the Petitioner-Society especially when all procedural requirements of 
due process for calling the SGM had been complied with by the 

10 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 45114 / 2022 
 
 
Petitioner-Society. The SGM as per the approval accorded by the 
Registrar was to be attended by the representatives of the Registrar and 
the decisions taken by the members was again subject to approval by 
the Registrar. The requirement of quorum is designated to afford 
regularity to a convened meeting and a fix a minimum number of 
members without which the business of a society cannot be conducted. 
There is no bar on any member to attend and participate in the SGM. 
However, the requirements of quorum cannot be mandatorily fixed in a 
manner that no business of a society can be transacted at all. By fixing 
33% of the total members of Phase-II of the Petitioner-Society as 
quorum, the Registrar had virtually paralyzed the functioning of the 
Petitioner-Society as the Management Committee is only obligated to 
adopt due process with respect to convening of the SGM and cannot 
compel any member to compulsorily attend and participate in the SGM. 
The implication of fixing the quorum by the Registrar is that if 33% of 
the total members do not attend the SGM, it can never be held. In case, 
the Registrar was of the view that the stipulated quorum in the by-laws 
was inadequate, it had powers to require the Petitioner-Society to 
amend its by-laws but the said power was never invoked by the 
Registrar. It is strange to note that on the one hand, the Registrar had 
approved the quorum of the Petitioner-Society by approving its by-laws 
but on the other hand, was not ready to recognize and give effect to the 
same.    
13. 
 
The imposition of condition of quorum is also inconsistent 
with condition No. 8 of the SOPs issued by the Registrar for holding the 
AGM / SGM of cooperative housing societies in Punjab which 
stipulates that quorum listed in the by-laws for holding the AGM / 
SGM shall be strictly observed and no deviation to this effect shall be 
made. By imposing the condition of quorum inconsistent with the by-
law 23, the Registrar and the Secretary Cooperatives themselves 
violated the SOPs and issued a direction beyond their regulatory 
mandate conferred by the Act and the Rules, thereby, rendering the 
stipulated quorum in the by-laws of the Petitioner-Society as redundant 

11 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 45114 / 2022 
 
 
and thus, clogging the democratic and independent functioning of the 
Petitioner-Society. The role of the regulator is not to micro manage the 
affairs of the Petitioner-Society and the members are free to discuss, 
deliberate and take decision in their best interest. Therefore, direction 
No. 3 imposed by the Registrar and upheld by the Secretary 
Cooperatives with respect to quorum was unlawful, unreasonable, 
arbitrary, capricious and in colorable exercise of authority.  The same is 
accordingly, struck down. 
14. 
Impugned direction No. 6 required that the resolution(s) must be 
approved with two-third majority of members present in the SGM 
instead of simple majority. The consideration of agenda in the SGM 
included an option for auction of land of Phase-II and funds to be 
returned to the members. The consequences of approval of this option 
can virtually trigger the winding-up of Phase-II of the Petitioner-
Society. As noted above, some provisions of the Act such as Sections 
15, 15-A and 47 with respect to amalgamation, division, merger and 
winding-up of a society require a resolution to be passed by two-third 
majority of the members present and voting in the AGM or the SGM. 
Therefore, considering the nature of the business of the Petitioner-
Society having a critical impact on the proprietary rights of the 
members, the direction of the Registrar was reasonable and justified 
within the scope of law and the by-laws, particularly, bylaw 26 cited 
above. Further, it is also observed that this particular direction of the 
Registrar was not specifically impugned in the Revision Petition 
instituted by the Petitioner-Society before the Secretary Cooperatives. 
Hence, no case of interference is made out with respect to direction No. 
6 issued by the Registrar. Accordingly, the same is upheld.   
  
15. 
 
In view of the above, this Petition is partially allowed; and 
the impugned Orders dated 05.07.2022 and 18.07.2022 are modified in 
the manner that condition No. 3 specifying quorum inconsistent with by-
law No. 23 is stuck down. The Petitioner-Society is directed to convene 
its SGM, if not already held, within a period of 30 days from the date of 

12 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 45114 / 2022 
 
 
this Order. If the SGM has taken place, the Registrar is directed to 
proceed further in accordance with law.
