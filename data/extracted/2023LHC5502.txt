Vs. 
Government of Punjab etc. 
 
              
Date of hearing 
25-10-2023 
Petitioners by 
Hafiz Sarfraz Ahmad Baguka, Advocate. 
Respondents by 
Mr. Omer Farooq Khan, Assistant Advocate-
General, Punjab. 
 
ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. In this Constitutional Petition, 
the petitioners have challenged the order dated 18.04.2023 
(impugned order) passed by respondent No.2, whereby 
petitioners’ representation to treat them as “regular employees” 
instead of “permanent workmen” has been declined.  
2. 
The relevant facts are that the petitioners were appointed 
on purely temporary/daily wages basis in the Punjab Local 
Government Board (Board) in year 2011-2012 and since then 
they are performing their duties. In previous round of litigation, 
the petitioners filed various writ petitions, including Writ 
Petition No.116480/2017, which were allowed by this Court vide 
judgment dated 10.10.2019 in terms of the judgment dated 
16.12.2016, passed in Writ Petition No.7910 of 2016. The 
respondent-department challenged the said judgment dated 
10.10.2019 in Appeal before the Division Bench of this Court, 
however, subject to outcome of the Appeal the petitioners were 
declared as “permanent workmen” in terms of the Standing 
Order No.1(b) of Industrial and Commercial Employment 

[-2-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
(Standing Orders) Ordinance, 1968 (Ordinance of 1968), 
through separate orders of even date i.e. 12.03.2020 by the 
department. The petitioners, being aggrieved of the aforesaid 
orders, filed their representation on the ground that they are to be 
regularized with the Board instead of declaring them as 
“permanent workmen”, however, their representation has been 
declined through the impugned order, hence, this Constitutional 
Petition.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that number of 
similar employees have already been regularized by the Board/ 
Department, therefore, the petitioners cannot be treated as 
“permanent workmen”. He submits that the orders, declaring the 
petitioners as “permanent workmen”, are not only contrary to the 
judgments of this Court dated 16.12.2016 & 10.10.2019 but also 
against the case law developed on the subject from time to time.  
4. 
Learned Law Officer, on the other hand, submits that the 
petitioners being “daily wagers” could only be treated as 
“permanent workmen” under the provisions of the Ordinance of 
1968 and cannot be treated as “regular employees or civil 
servants”, who can only be appointed through competition on 
open merit. He submits that the petitioners’ appointments as 
“permanent workmen” are in line with the law laid down by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in “PROVINCE OF PUNJAB 

[-3-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
through Secretary Communication and Works Department and 
others. Vs. AHMAD HUSSAIN” (2013 SCMR 1547) and the 
Departmental Policies dated 27.12.2019 & 29.01.2021.  
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused 
the record with their able assistance. There is no dispute that the 
petitioners No.1 to 6 & 8 were enrolled as “daily wagers” in year 
2011, whereas petitioner No.7 was engaged as “daily wager” in 
year 2012 with the Board and all the petitioners are seeking their 
regularization on the basis of judgments dated 16.12.2016 and 
10.10.2019 by this Court, being “daily wagers” with the Board 
for long period of time. However, admittedly no rules/ 
regulations, criteria or standards for appointment of daily wagers 
were prescribed at the relevant time by the Board and the 
petitioners were not enrolled after advertising the posts through 
competition on open merit. Under Section 187(2) of the Punjab 
Local Government Act, 2022 (Act XXXIII of 2022), the 
employees of the Punjab Local Government service shall be 
appointed through the Punjab Public Service Commission 
(PPSC) and under Section 187(4) of the Act XXXIII of 2022, all 
the employees of Punjab Local Government, appointed through 
PPSC against sanctioned posts on contract basis prior to 
commencement of the Act XXXIII of 2022, shall stand 
regularized in Punjab Local Government service on completion 

[-4-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
of their contracts period. No provision in any relevant previous 
law of the Local Government or Policy of the Board has been 
referred to, under which daily wagers who were not enrolled 
through open merit competition, shall be treated as regular 
employees of the Board or civil servants merely due to afflux of 
time rather the employee, on work charged basis or paid from 
contingencies or who is a worker or workman, has been 
specifically excluded from the definition of “Civil Servant” 
described under Section 2(b) of the Punjab Civil Servant Act, 
1974 (Act of 1974).  
6. 
The relevant law, which provides protection to the daily 
wagers who have been performing their duties against permanent 
posts for long period of time, is Para 1(b) of the Schedule 
attached to the Ordinance of 1968. For ready reference the 
aforesaid provision is reproduced hereunder:- 
“(b) A “permanent workman” is a workman 
who has been engaged on work of permanent 
nature likely to last more than nine months and 
has satisfactorily completed a probationary 
period of three months in the same or another 
occupation in the industrial or commercial 
establishment, including breaks due to sickness, 
accident, leave, lock-out, strike (not being an 
illegal lock-out or strike) or involuntary closure 
of the establishment and includes a badli who 
has been employed for a continuous period of 
three months or for one hundred and eighty-
three days during any period of twelve 
consecutive months.” 
 

[-5-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
Under aforesaid Para 1(b) of the Schedule, attached to Ordinance 
of 1968, “permanent workman” is a workman who has been 
engaged on work of permanent nature likely to last more than 
nine months and has satisfactorily completed a probationary 
period of three months in the same or another occupation in the 
industrial or commercial establishment. In similar situation, a 
“daily wager” working with the Communication and Works 
Department, Government of the Punjab, sought his regularization 
due to afflux of time and the Supreme Court of Pakistan in case 
of “Province of Punjab Vs. Ahmad Hussain” (2013 SCMR 
1547) supra held that service of a “daily wager” shall be 
governed by the Ordinance of 1968 and he shall be treated as 
“permanent employee”. The relevant part of the judgment is 
reproduced as under:- 
“Thus, it is held that service of respondent shall 
be governed by Standing Order Ordinance, 
1968 and he shall be considered permanent 
employee, as he is performing his duties 
continuously for more than 9 months since 1998 
and the learned High Court has rightly issued 
writ in his favour.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan, in aforesaid judgment, did not 
treat “daily wager” as “regular employee or regular civil servant” 
rather specifically recorded that his services shall be governed by 
Ordinance of 1968 and he will be considered as “permanent 
employee”.

Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
7. 
At this juncture, it is pertinent to note that the petitioners 
are seeking their regularization in view of this Court’s judgment 
dated 10.10.2019, in which cases of the petitioners were decided 
in the same terms as of the judgment dated 16.12.2016, passed in 
Writ Petition No.7910/2016. For convenience, the concluding 
Paras No.7 & 8 of judgment dated 16.12.2016 are reproduced 
hereunder:- 
“Earlier in an identical matter, involving 
similar issue Writ Petition No.826/2011 titled 
“Ahmad Hassan etc. Vs. Government of the 
Punjab” was filed by some similarly placed 
employees which was allowed by this Court, 
vide order dated 06.12.2012 against which the 
respondents-department filed ICA No.11 of 
2011. A learned Division Bench of this Court, 
vide order dated 14.3.2013, upheld the order of 
the Single Bench of this Court. Aggrieved the 
respondent-Department filed Civil Petition 
No.708 of 2013 before the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, which was also dismissed 
with cost of Rs.50,000/-. The judgment of the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan is reported 
as Province of Punjab through Secretary 
Communication and Works Department and 
others Vs. Ahmad Hassan (2013 SCMR 1547). 
In this view of the matter, the case of the present 
petitioners being at par with the petitioners of 
the cited case, they are also entitled to the same 
relief. 
For what has been discussed above, all the writ 
petitions mentioned in para 1 of this judgment 
are allowed and the respondents are directed to 
proceed for regularization of services of the 
petitioners immediately.” 
 
The concluding part of this Court’s judgment dated 16.12.2016 
(on basis of which petitioners’ writ petitions were allowed), 

[-7-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
shows that same has been decided in view of the law settled in 
“Province of Punjab Vs. Ahmad Hussain” (2013 SCMR 1547) 
supra, where the Supreme Court specifically considered the 
“daily wager” as “permanent employee” and not “regular 
employee or civil servant”. The direction, in this Court’s 
judgment dated 16.12.2016, to regularize the services has to be 
read in context of the Ordinance of 1968 and the aforesaid 
judgment of the Supreme Court relied upon, which means to 
regularize the petitioners being daily wagers as “permanent 
employees/workmen” under the Ordinance of 1968. The word 
“regularization” cannot be construed to treat “daily wagers” as 
“regular employees” of the Board or “civil servants”, as such 
interpretation will not only be against the law settled by the 
Supreme Court in “Province of Punjab Vs. Ahmad Hussain” 
supra but also go beyond the specific provision of Para 1(b) of 
the Schedule to the Ordinance of 1968 and Section 2(b) of the 
Act of 1974, and will amount to circumvent the entire due 
process of open merit competition, required for appointments of 
civil servants and regular employees in Public Sectors, including 
the Board.  
8. 
The argument of petitioners that their appointments as 
“permanent workmen” and not as “regular employees” are 
contrary to the case law developed from time to time, is also 

[-8-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
misconceived. The case law on the subject shows that similar 
proposition came up before the Supreme Court in “Punjab Seed 
Corporation v. Punjab Labour Appellate Tribunal” (1996 
SCMR 1947), where the respondent was appointed as “Field 
Supervisor” on temporary basis on 25.06.1980 and continued as 
such till 30.07.1991, when his services were terminated. The said 
writ petitioner challenged his termination order before the 
Labour Court on the ground that he was a “permanent workman” 
and as such his services cannot be terminated without due 
process of law. The petitioner in said writ petition was reinstated 
in service and the order was maintained up to the Supreme Court. 
In “Ikram Bari and 524 others v. National Bank of Pakistan 
through President and another” (2005 SCMR 100), the daily 
wagers were regularized in service as permanent employees of 
National Bank but there was a Policy of the Bank to absorb daily 
wagers subject to qualification but same was applied on pick and 
choose basis, hence, direction was issued to the Bank to absorb 
the petitioners/daily wagers as per Policy (however, in present 
case admittedly there is no such policy of the Board to absorb 
daily wagers as regular employees). In “Secretary Irrigation and 
Power Department, Government of Punjab, Lahore and others v. 
Muhammad Akhtar and others” (2009 SCMR 320), “Province of 
Punjab through Secretary and others v. Ahmad Hussain” (2013 

[-9-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
SCMR 1547) and “Pir Imran Sajid and others v. Managing 
Director and others” (2015 SCMR 1257),  in crux it was held 
that “work charged employee”, who was working for more than 
90 days against post of permanent nature in a project which 
continued more than nine months, attains the status of 
“permanent employee” under the provisions of the Ordinance of 
1968. In “Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, 
Faisalabad through Chairman and others Versus Tanveer Sajid 
and others” (2018 SCMR 1405), Board of Intermediate and 
Secondary Education, DG Khan and another Versus Muhammad 
Altaf and others” (2018 SCMR 325) and Board of Intermediate 
and Secondary Education, Multan through Chairman and 
another Versus Muhammad Sajid and others” (2019 SCMR 
233), the daily wagers were regularized on the ground that they 
were performing job of permanent nature for long period of time 
with artificial breaks and were also discriminated. In aforesaid 
judgments, Para 1(b) of the Schedule, attached to Ordinance of 
1968, has not been specifically mentioned but the law developed 
on the basis of said provision was applied from time to time to 
regularize the services of daily wagers as permanent employees. 
9. 
It is relevant to note that the Supreme Court in “Secretary, 
Irrigation and Power Department Government of Punjab, 
Lahore and others Vs. Muhammad Akhtar and others” (2009 

[-10-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
SCMR 320) though upheld the judgment of the Labour Court, 
whereby the “work charged employees” were regularized, 
however, the question that whether such employees can be 
treated as civil servants, was kept as an open question to be 
decided in some other appropriate case. The relevant part of the 
judgment is reproduced hereunder:-  
“The question whether such employees were to 
be treated to be civil servants was not seriously 
agitated by the petitioner department at the 
appropriate stage. Prima-facie, in view of the 
definition contained in section 2 of Punjab Civil 
Servant Act, 1974, the work-charged employees 
did not fall within the category of Civil 
Servants. However this point needs to be 
examined further in some other appropriate 
case.” 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
The aforesaid judgment was though followed by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in “Province of Punjab Vs. Ahmad Hussain” 
(2013 SCMR 1547) supra, however, the “daily wagers” were 
not directed to be regularized rather they were directed to be 
considered as “permanent employees” under Ordinance of 1968.  
10. 
Recently, in “BOARD OF INTERMEDIATE AND 
SECONDARY EDUCATION, BAHAWALPUR etc. Versus SHER 
MUHAMMAD and others” (PLJ 2022 SC 35), the matter for 
regularization of services of the “daily wagers” in Board of 
Intermediate and Secondary Education, Bahawalpur came up 
before the Supreme Court, where the daily wagers were not 

[-11-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
regularized as “regular employees” rather with consent of the 
parties, it was held that posts should be advertised and Board of 
Intermediate & Secondary Education will give maximum of 5% 
additional marks for their past services as daily wagers. The 
relevant observations are as follows:- 
“3. We have considered the proposal and gone 
through the record of the case, as well as, the 
Rules, and are of the view that said posts should 
be advertised as per the Rules. However, in all 
fairness to the respondents, they may be given a 
maximum of five percent additional marks for 
their past service as daily wagers with the 
Board, while evaluating their candidature on 
open merit after public advertisement. We leave 
it to the Board to decide what percentage within 
the five percent be granted to various 
respondents keeping in view their length of 
service as daily wagers. Let this exercise be 
undertaken in the next months. The public 
advertisement for these posts must specify this 
requirement so that anyone applying for fresh 
recruitment is aware of this facility being 
extended to the daily wagers.” 
 
11. 
The arguments of the petitioners that similarly placed 
“daily wagers” have been regularized, therefore, they are also 
entitled for the same relief, has also no basis. More or less in 
similar situation, same question came up before the Islamabad 
High Court in “Waseem Riaz and 119 others Versus Ministry of 
Capital Administration and Development (CADD) through 
Secretary and another” (2019 PLC (C.S.) 403). In said case, the 
petitioners were appointed on daily wage basis in Pay Scale 16 & 
17 without observing the principle of transparency, and in 

[-12-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
pursuant to recommendations by the Sub-Committee of the 
Cabinet, they were conditionally regularized vide Notification 
dated 08.02.2013 in service i.e. subject to availability of posts. 
The petitioners sought implementation of the Notification for 
regularization through Constitutional Petition, however, same 
was dismissed mainly on the ground that civil servant can only 
be appointed under the provisions of the Civil Servant Act, 1973 
and the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) 
Rules, 1973 and the department had no power to regularize the 
petitioners by superseding or overriding the statutory provisions 
of Act and Rules. It is also held that no discrimination can be 
claimed in such situation. The relevant part of the order is 
reproduced hereunder:- 
“40. The provisions of the Act of 1973 and the 
APT Rules have been discussed in detail. A civil 
servant, therefore, can only be appointed 
against a permanent post in the manner 
provided under the relevant law and after 
following the mandatory requirements which 
have been prescribed under the Act of 1973 and 
APT Rules. The Cabinet Sub-Committee was not 
vested with power or jurisdiction nor could have 
substituted the role of the Commission under the 
Act of 1973 and the APT Rules in context of 
appointments made in pay scales 16 and 17. The 
approval regarding regularization of the 
petitioners purportedly granted by the Sub-
Committee of Cabinet in its meeting held on 13-
12-2012 was ultra vires the Act of 1973 and the 
APT Rules. Likewise, the Capital Administration 
and Development Division was not vested with 

[-13-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
power 
or 
jurisdiction 
to 
regularize 
the 
petitioners by superseding or overriding the 
statutory provisions of the Act of 1973 and the 
APT Rules. 
41. …..………. Neither the Act of 1973 nor the 
APT Rules were amended in order to give effect 
to the policy of regularization. Moreover, the 
initial appointments of the petitioners on daily 
wage basis were made in violation of the 
principles of transparency and thus void. There 
is no force in the argument that since other 
similarly placed persons have been regularized, 
therefore, the petitioners cannot be treated 
differently. It is settled law that an illegality 
cannot be made a ground for discrimination nor 
would give rise to rights being accrued in 
favour of the petitioners. Reliance is placed on 
cases titled “Khalid Saeed vs. Shamim Rizvan 
and others” [2003 SCMR 1505] and “Mst. 
Mukhtar Begum and others v. Ala-ud-Din and 
others” [1999 SCMR 914].” 
 
From above case law, it can easily be deduced that enrollment 
through daily wages, without any prescribed criteria, standards 
and transparent procedure, cannot be a route to become civil 
servant or regular employee in Public Sectors, including the 
Board rather “daily wager” can only be treated as “permanent 
employee/workman” under the Ordinance of 1968.  
12. 
The legal question that whether the petitioners are entitled 
to be treated even as “permanent employees/workmen” is still a 
sub-judice matter in Appeal, however, prima facie the provisions 
of the Ordinance of 1968 are applicable to the Board, as 
admittedly the Government of Punjab, Services & General 

[-14-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
Administration Department (Regulations/O&M Wing), vide 
Notification dated 29.01.2021, applied daily wager Policy in line 
with the Ordinance of 1968 to various departments as under:- 
“3. 
STATUS 
OF 
WORK 
CHARGED 
EMPLOYEES, 
DAILY 
WAGERS 
& 
CONTINGENT PAID STAFF.  
i. According to Section 2(b) of the Punjab 
Civil Servants Act, 1974, a person who is 
employed on work-charged basis, or who is 
paid from contingencies or who is a worker 
or workman as defined in the Factories Act, 
1924 (XXV of 1934) or the Workmen’s 
Compensation Act, 1923 (VIII of 1923) are 
excluded from the definition of ‘civil 
servant’. Hence, the status of civil servant is 
beyond their scope.  
ii.  In order to regulate the services rendered 
by existing work-charged and such other 
employees, their status needs to be clarified. 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
its judgment in Civil Petition No.708 of 
2013 (2013 SCMR No.1547) has determined 
the status of work-charged employees. It has 
been held by the August Supreme Court of 
Pakistan that services of a daily wage 
employee 
shall 
be 
governed 
by 
the 
Industrial and Commercial Employment 
(Standing Orders) Ordinance, 1968 and he 
shall be considered as a permanent 
workman if he is performing his duties 
continuously for more than 9 months. 
Hence, in such cases, where the Labour 
Courts have passed such direction to 
regularize the services of the daily wage / 
work charge employees, they may be 
declared as ‘Permanent Workman’ only, in 
light of Punjab Industrial & Commercial 
Employment Standing (Orders) Ordinance 
1968.” 
 
13. 
Under the aforesaid Policy, the daily wagers are to be 
treated as permanent workmen as per law settled by the Supreme 

[-15-] 
Writ Petition No.30999/2023 
 
 
 
 
Court in “Province of Punjab Vs. Ahmad Hussain” (2013 
SCMR 1547) supra and the provisions of the Ordinance of 1968. 
The impugned appointment orders dated 12.03.2020 of the 
petitioners as “permanent workmen” subject to Appeal are not 
only in line with the relevant law but also the aforesaid Policy. It 
is needless to observe that the aforesaid Policy is not under 
challenge in this Writ Petition.  
14. 
In view of above discussion, no illegality or infirmity is 
found in orders dated 12.03.2020, whereby the petitioners were 
treated as “permanent workmen” and consequently their 
representation was declined by respondent No.2 through the 
impugned order. Accordingly, this Writ Petition being meritless 
is dismissed.
