J U D G M E N T 
Date of Hearing: 
14.05.2024 
Petitioner by: 
Hafiz Rehman Aziz, Advocate. 
Respondent No.3 by: Mr. Salah-ud-Din Siddiqui, Advocate. 
        
 
Anwaar Hussain, J.  Through this single judgment, present as 
well as connected constitutional petition bearing W.P. No.69876/2023 
are being simultaneously decided, as common question of law and facts 
are involved, and both the petitions have laid challenge to the findings 
of the Courts below, emanating from the eviction proceedings initiated 
by respondent No.3, namely, Riasat Ali, (“respondent”), who is the 
petitioner in connected petition.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the tenancy 
between the petitioner and the respondent was valid for a period of 10-
years and the eviction was sought on the ground of default and personal 
need, however, issue in respect of default only was framed, by the Rent 
Tribunal, and despite the fact that the same could not be proved as per 
the findings of the Appellate Court below, dated 27.05.2023, the 
petitioner has been directed by the Appellate Court below to vacate the 
rented premises on the ground that the relationship between the parties 
has become strained. Adds that such innovative ground for eviction is 
violative of both the tenancy agreement between the parties as well as 
the provision of the Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (“Act”) as the 
grounds available for eviction has been stipulated by the legislature in 
Section 15 thereof, thus, strained relation as a ground of eviction is 

2 
W.P. No.38539 of 2023 
 
 
alien. Further contends that the respondent was obligated to give 
concise statement regarding the period for which the arrears were 
claimed in terms of Section 19(3) of the Act that has not been given 
and the same is fatal; that the payment of rent from 01.09.2021 to 
17.01.2022 is duly acknowledged by the respondent in terms of Exh-R-
1; and that the respondent has taken contradictory positions inasmuch 
as in the eviction petition, default in payment of monthly rent for one 
year has been alleged without specifying the date of default as also the 
exact period thereof, whereas, in his appeal preferred against the 
impugned final order of the Rent Tribunal, default from the outset of 
the tenancy has been alleged.  
3. 
Conversely, it is the case of the respondent that the document-
(Exh.R-1) is a private document, having no evidentiary value and has 
been wrongly relied upon by the Appellate Court below as an 
admission on part of the respondent. Adds that even otherwise, default 
for the period of six months w.e.f. April, 2021 to August, 2021 and 
February, 2022, which the Rent Tribunal held against the petitioner, 
has been upended on the basis of presumption as the petitioner side 
failed to establish that the monthly rent for the said period was paid.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
Following questions of law require opinion of this Court: 
i. 
What is the effect of failure on part of an ejectment 
petitioner to give concise statement in terms of 
Section 19(3) of the Act regarding the period for 
which he claims arrears of rent? 
ii. 
Whether strained and hostile relationship between 
the landlord and the tenant developed, on account 
of eviction proceedings initiated by the landlord, is 
a valid ground for eviction of the tenant, under the 
Act? 
6. 
The tenancy relationship between the parties as well as the 
tenancy period of ten years, commencing from 01.09.2020, is admitted. 
It is also admitted feature of the case that the rented premises was a 

3 
W.P. No.38539 of 2023 
 
 
vacant plot on which the petitioner has established a Marquee by 
investing and injecting a substantial amount of capital. When the 
respondent approached the Rent Tribunal, on 30.03.2022, in para No.3 
of the ejectment petition, he stated as under: 
"

(Emphasis supplied)
 
 
 
 
The petitioner denied the averments contained in the petition. Leave to 
contest was allowed and following issues were framed: 
 
“ISSUES 
1. Whether respondent is wilful defaulter in the 
payment of rent. If so, at what rate and for 
which period? OPP 
2. Whether respondent is liable to eviction from 
demised premises? OPP 
3. Whether the petitioner has got no cause of 
action? OPR 
4. Order.” 
 
7. 
It has been noted that only issue of default was framed to which 
the respondent side has not laid any challenge. The respondent 
appeared as AW-1, whereas, one Muhammad Mahad and Muhammad 
Nawaz appeared as AW-2 and AW-3, respectively, whereas, on behalf 
of the petitioner, he himself appeared as RW-1, one Nasir Hayat and 
Nadeem Ghaffar appeared as RW-2 and RW-3, respectively. The Rent 
Tribunal held that the petitioner has not paid rent from April, 2021 to 
August, 2021 and February, 2022 and on this ground allowed the 
eviction petition, whereas, when the appeals were preferred by both 
sides, the appeal of the respondent was dismissed, whereas, the appeal 

4 
W.P. No.38539 of 2023 
 
 
of the petitioner was partly allowed and findings of the learned Rent 
Tribunal determining the arrears of monthly rent from the month of 
April 2021 to August, 2021 and February, 2022 were set aside.  
8. 
Having above referred factual matrix and evidentiary resume of 
the case in sight, and before answering the first legal question, it will be 
appropriate to reproduce Section 19 of the Act that reads as under: 
19. Filing of application.– (1) An application in respect 
of a rented premises shall be filed in the Rent Tribunal of 
the area or the district. 
 (2)  If an application is filed under sub-section (1), the 
Administrative Special Judge (Rent) of the area or the 
district may take cognizance of the case or entrust the same 
to any other Special Judge (Rent). 
(3)  An application under sub-section (1) shall contain a 
concise statement of facts, the relief claimed and shall 
be accompanied by copies of all relevant documents in 
possession of the applicant. 
(4)  If the application is for eviction of a tenant, the 
landlord shall submit his affidavit and affidavits of not 
more than two witnesses along with the eviction 
application. 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
9. 
The term “concise statement” has not been defined by the Act, 
however, Order VI, Rule 2 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 refers to 
the term in the following manner: 
“Every pleading shall contain, and contain only, a 
statement in a concise form of the material facts on 
which the party pleading relies for his claim or 
defence, as the case may be…” 
(Emphasis supplied)   
In common legal parlance, concise statement indicates reciting of facts 
with precision that forms basis of a claim and/or underlies the accrual 
of cause of action.  The underlying purpose is to simplify the key issues 
in dispute. Therefore, the concise statement must contain enough 
details of the dispute to steer the Court’s focus only to the relevant 
issues making it easier for it to adjudicate. In relation to the eviction 

5 
W.P. No.38539 of 2023 
 
 
proceedings initiated under the Act, the term concise statement referred 
in Section 19(3) of the Act, mandates the ejectment petitioner to give 
the details of the allegation against the respondent and if the allegation 
of default in payment of monthly rent is made, sufficient details 
pertaining to the date from which the default occurred as also the claim 
as on the date of filing of the ejectment petition becomes sine qua non 
of such eviction petition to succeed. In the present case, it is pertinent 
to note that the respondent in his eviction petition has not given any 
detail of the period of default of rent, hence, the relevant issue framed 
was generic in nature. The shifting pleadings of the respondent in the 
present case present a classic case study revealing the wisdom of 
legislature as to why it mandated the concise statement of facts to be 
spelled out in an application under Section 19 of the Act. Had the 
statutory requirement of concise statement been adhered to, not only 
the petitioner would have known the averments with exactitude but 
there would have been also no space for the respondent to take a 
somersault in appeal as to the period of default. As stated earlier, when 
the appeal was preferred by the respondent, a ground was taken that the 
petitioner has not paid the amount of rent from outset of the tenancy 
i.e., 01.09.2020 to 01.09.2021. This stance, prima facie, was taken to 
cover the lacuna of the case inasmuch as in the eviction petition no 
period was given except for the statement that for one year the rent has 
not been paid by the petitioner, which, in the absence of specific date of 
default, would imply the year preceding the filing of the petition. The 
Appellate Court below rightly appreciated the said aspect of the case, 
in the judgment dated 27.05.2023, operative part whereof is reproduced 
hereunder: 
“13. Interestingly, the Respondent in paragraph No.3 of 
his appeal has improved his stance, that Appellant has 
not paid the amount of rent for the period starting from 
01.09.2020 to 01.09.2021. This stance appeared to be 
afterthought as the same is inconsistent with averments 
of eviction petition and evidence produced by the 
Respondent.  Further  this  stance  is  contradictory  to the  

6 
W.P. No.38539 of 2023 
 
 
admission made by the Respondent in his cross 
examination with regard to Acknowledgment receipt 
Exh.R1.” 
The true mandate of Section 19(3) of the Act is that it is obligatory for 
the ejectment petitioner/landlord to narrate all the relevant and 
necessary details of his claim (of default in the instant case) by 
elaborating the same with precision (in terms of the date of default and 
total period of default) and if he fails to do so, he cannot be allowed to 
improve upon the same through the evidence. Any such improvement 
would be fatal. In case reported as “ABDUL GHANI through L.Rs. vs 
Messrs CALTEX OIL PAKISTAN LIMITED” (2010 S C M R 771), 
where no period of default in payment of rent was mentioned in the 
ejectment petition, and in the evidence, the case had been set up that 
the increased annual rent of Rs.299 was not paid by the respondents, 
the Supreme Court held that the same is an improvement in the course 
of evidence and hence, the ejectment petitioner, in said case, was not 
given any credit for the same.  
10. 
Moreover, averment of learned counsel for the respondent that 
Exh.R-1 is a private document, having no evidentiary value is 
misconceived. No doubt it is a private document (part of a diary) where 
factum of receipt of rent has been recorded, however, it contains 
signatures of the respondent. On a pointed question by this Court, 
learned counsel has acknowledged the signatures of the respondent. 
Even otherwise, it belies logic that a person will enter into a tenancy 
agreement that is to take effect from 01.09.2020 and the tenant (the 
petitioner) will commit default from the outset and the landlord (the 
respondent) will not initiate any legal proceedings for a period of about 
two years while accepting the amount of rent with effect from 
01.09.2021 onwards and thereafter file the eviction petition without 
giving concise statement of the facts (qua period of default). This fact 
has rightly persuaded the Appellate Court below to partially allow the 
appeal of the petitioner, however, the Appellate Court below also 
directed the petitioner to vacate the rented premises.

W.P. No.38539 of 2023 
 
 
11. 
This takes me to the second legal question formulated 
hereinabove. The Appellate Court below erred in directing eviction of 
the petitioner on the ground that the relationship between the parties 
has become strained and environment of distrust between the parties 
has emerged as said reason does not constitute a ground of eviction 
contemplated under the Act. Section 15 of the Act is the relevant 
provision that reads as under: 
15. Grounds for eviction.– A landlord may seek eviction of the 
tenant if– 
     (a)  the period of tenancy has expired; 
      (b)  the tenant has failed to pay or tender the rent within a period 
of thirty days after the expiry of the period stipulated in 
section 7; 
      (c)   the tenant has committed breach of a term or condition of 
the tenancy agreement; 
      (d)   the tenant has committed a violation of an obligation under  
section 13; 
      (e)  the tenant has used the premises for a purpose which is 
different from the purpose for which it has been let out; or 
      (f)   the tenant has sub-let the premises without the prior written 
consent of the landlord. 
 
 
Suffice to observe that the Act aims to consolidate and amend the law 
relating to the relationship of landlord and tenant, inter alia, eviction of 
the tenant(s). The Act envisaged grounds of eviction in term of Section 
15 of the Act, quoted hereinabove and the fact that on account of 
litigation between the parties, their relationship have become strained, 
is not a valid ground to seek eviction. If such like grounds for eviction 
are allowed to be transplanted, this would amount to the Courts 
traversing beyond their domain of statutory adherence. In present case, 
the Appellate Court below has travelled beyond the legislative wisdom 
while passing the impugned judgment.  
12. 
Moreover, it is noted that the rented premises was a vacant plot 
at the time of creation of tenancy, which was developed into a Marquee 
by the petitioner on the basis of certainty harboured by him that the 
tenancy is for a period of 10 years and he would not be evicted  
 

8 
W.P. No.38539 of 2023 
 
 
therefrom except in situations which warrant his eviction under the 
tenancy agreement and/or the Act. The specific insertion of duration of 
10 years, as a tenancy period, reveals the intention of the parties that 
the tenancy is for fixed period that is long term. Certainly, the purpose 
is to ensure that the respondent/landlord would get rent during the said 
long term tenancy period and the petitioner/tenant would get return on 
his investment. The premature eviction of the petitioner in the absence 
of any contractual or statutory violation (default in this case) would not 
only engender injustice, being detrimental to the commercial interest of 
the petitioner, but would also undermine the public trust in 
investment/commercial contracts and their enforcement by the Courts 
that cannot be allowed by this Court.   
13. 
In view of the preceding discussion, the present petition is 
allowed and direction to the petitioner to vacate the rented premises is 
set aside whereas the connected petition bearing W.P. No.69876/2023 
is dismissed. No order as to costs.
