Mr. Ghulam Awais Ahmad Siddiqi, Advocate.

CH. MUHAMMAD IQBAL, J:- 
Through 
this 
civil revision, the petitioner has challenged the vires of 
consolidated judgment & decree dated 17.10.2014 passed by 
the learned Civil Judge, Kamalia whereby suit for declaration 
filed by the petitioner was dismissed and suit for declaration 
filed by respondents No.1 & 2 was decreed and also assailed 
the judgment & decree dated 11.12.2017 passed by the 
learned Addl. District Judge, Pir Mahal who dismissed the 
appeal of the petitioner.     
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that Noora son of Makhna 
had four real brothers namely Rustam, Muhammad, Fazil and 
Jahana (issueless). Noora son of Makhna was married with 
Mst. Sammo and from this wedlock a daughter Mst. Nooran only 
was born. After death of Noora in the year 1940 his widow  
Mst. Sammo contracted second marriage with Rustam, who  

Civil Revision No.164468/2018 
2 
 
 
was real brother of Noora. From this wedlock of Mst. 
Sammo  with Rustam, Manzoor Ahmad was born; that Mst. 
Nooran daughter of Noora was owner of property measuring 
76-Kanals 16-Marlas comprising Khewat Nos.14 and 15 
situated in Chak No.699/GB, Tehsil Kamalia. She died as 
spinster (unmarried), and her inheritance mutation No.294 
dated 20.07.2002 was sanctioned in favour of her uterine 
brother Manzoor Ahmad. The other sons of Rustam from his 
wedlock with Mst. Sattan namely Chiragh etc. (plaintiffs/ 
respondents No.1 and 2) filed a suit for declaration that the 
plaintiff and defendant being sons of Rustam step father of 
deceased Nooran Bibi are entitled to inherit share from her 
estate and their names may also be incorporate in the revenue 
record, 
whereas 
inheritance 
mutation 
No.294 
dated 
20.07.2002 of deceased Nooran, exclusively  in favour of the 
petitioner/defendant No.1 namely Manzoor Ahmad is against 
the law and facts, based on fraud and same is ineffective 
upon the rights of the plaintiffs and is liable to be cancelled.  
 
Present petitioner/defendant No.1/Manzoor Ahmad 
contested the said suit on factual and legal parlances as well 
as filed suit for declaration with the assertion that Mst. 
Nooran his real sister was owner of the suit property. 
Petitioner/defendant being her real brother /the sole heir of 
the deceased is owner of the said property as Mst. Nooran 
died on 14.10.2001 after the death of plaintiffs father Rustam 

Civil Revision No.164468/2018 
3 
 
 
on 
09.06.2001, 
but 
Chiragh 
Khan 
etc. 
the 
respondents/plaintiffs got prepared a forged death certificate 
of Nooran showing her date of death as 10.06.1998 just to 
deprive the petitioner / defendant from his inherited land. 
The adverse parties contested the suits of each other by filing 
written statement by controverting the assertions of each 
other on legal and factual judicial parlances. Both suits were 
consolidated, accordingly issues were framed and the parties 
lead their respective oral as well as documentary evidence. 
The trial court vide consolidated judgment & decree dated 
17.10.2014 decreed the suit of Chiragh Khan etc. 
respondents No.1 & 2 as prayed for, whereas dismissed the 
suit of the petitioner / Manzoor Ahmad. Against the said 
judgment & decree, the petitioner preferred an appeal which 
was dismissed vide judgment & decree dated 11.12.2017 by 
the appellate court. Hence, this civil revision.  
3. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
4. 
As both the divergent parties filed civil suit against 
each other, thus for clarity Chiragh Khan and Zahoor Ahmad 
respondent No.1 & 2 will be referred hereinafter as 
respondents/ plaintiffs whereas Manzoor Ahmad will be 
cited as petitioner/ defendant No.1. 
5. 
The main controversy involves in this lis is centered 
upon issue Nos.1 to 3 which are reproduced as under:- 

Civil Revision No.164468/2018 
4 
 
 
“1. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to decree for 
declaration regarding suit land, as prayed for in the plaint? 
OPP 
2. Whether the inheritance mutation No.294 dated 
20.07.2002 is against the law and facts and is liable to be 
set aside? OPP 
3. 
Whether Mst. Nooran daughter of Noora died on 
14.10.2001 instead of 10.06.1998 and the death certificate 
of said Nooran bearing date of her death on 10.06.1998 is 
false, against the law, based on fraud and thus liable to be 
cancelled? OPP” 
 
Chiragh Khan etc., plaintiff/ respondents filed a suit for 
declaration challenging therein the vires of inheritance 
mutation No.294 dated 20.07.2002 with the assertion that 
Mst. Nooran daughter of Noora died on 10.06.1998 and at 
that 
time, 
Rustum 
predecessor 
in 
interest 
of 
the 
respondents/plaintiffs, real uncle of Nooran remained alive 
till 09.06.2001 and he died after the death of Mst. Nooran as 
such they are entitled to inherit share from her estate, 
whereas 
Petitioner/defendant 
No.1/Manzoor 
Ahmad 
fraudulently got incorporated mutation No.294 dated 
20.07.2002 in his favour. In support of above version, 
Chiragh Khan (one of the plaintiffs) appeared as PW1 who 
stated that Nooran died on 10.06.1998 at the age of 60/65 
years without solemnization marriage. Rustam died on 
09.06.2001 who was real uncle of Nooran and was only 
owner, as such mutation No.294 is based on fraud. In cross 
examination he admitted that against sanctioning of 
inheritance mutation, he filed an appeal before DOR which 
was dismissed. Murad appeared as PW2 who stated that 

Civil Revision No.164468/2018 
5 
 
 
mutation No.294 was wrongly incorporated in favour of 
Manzoor Ahmad.        
6. 
Conversely, Zakir Hussain appeared as DW1 who 
stated that he is general attorney of Manzoor Ahmad son of 
Rustam. Mst. Nooran was daughter of Noora who died on 
14.10.2001. She was owner of the suit land and was alive on 
10.06.1998 and Chiragh with collusiveness of the official of 
Union Council got prepared a forged death certificate of Mst. 
Nooran, as such death certificate is forged which is liable to 
be cancelled. From mother side Manzoor is real brother of 
Nooran. The inheritance mutation No.294 of Nooran was 
rightly incorporated in the revenue record in favour of 
Manzoor Ahmad. Against the said mutation Chiragh, Zahoor 
Ahmad, Gull Muhammad, Murad and Pehalwan filed an 
application before DDOR Kamalia for cancellation of 
inheritance mutation No.294 which was dismissed on 
10.04.2003 whereafter Chiragh Khan and Zahoor Ahmad 
filed suit. Muhammad Sadiq appeared as DW2 who stated 
that:-

7.  
As per available record, Noora contracted marriage 
with Mst. Samoo and from the said wedlock, Mst. Nooran 
was born. After death of Noora in the year 1940, his widow 

Civil Revision No.164468/2018 
6 
 
 
Mst. Samoo contracted second marriage with Rustam who 
was real brother of deceased Noora. From the second 
wedlock of Mst. Samo with Rustam, petitioner/Manzoor 
Ahmad was born as such he is uterine brother of Mst. Nooran 
deceased. For ready reference, admitted the pedigree table of 
the parties of the lis is reproduced as under:-

8. 
Admittedly, parties of the lis as well as their 
predecessor are Muslims and controversial issue of 
inheritance of a deceased Muslim are to be resolved 
according to Quran and Sunnah. Even as per Article 227 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, 
the principles of Quran and Sunnah are admitted as supreme  
law of this country and all provisions, rules, regulations are 
to be legislated and framed within the precincts of Islamic 
principles.  For reference, Article 227 of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is reproduced as under:- 
227. Provisions relating to the Holy Quran and 
Sunnah.-(1) All existing laws shall be brought in 
conformity with the Injunctions of Islam as laid down 

Civil Revision No.164468/2018 
7 
 
 
in the Holy Quran and Sunnah, in this Part referred 
to as the Injunctions of Islam, and no law shall be 
enacted which is repugnant to such injunctions. 
 
Explanation.-In the application of this clause to the 
personal law of any Muslim sect, the expression 
“Quran and Sunnah” shall mean the Quran and 
Sunnah as interpreted by that sect. 
 
(2) Effect shall be given to the provisions of clause (1) 
only in the manner provided in this Part. 
(3) Nothing in this Part shall affect the personal laws 
of non-Muslim citizens or their status as citizens. 
 
As the predecessor-in-interest of the parties of the lis as well 
as the parties themselves are Muslims and principles of 
Quran and Sunnah are mandatorily applicable upon them as 
well. The shares of each and every Muslim inheritor have 
conclusively been prescribed in Holy Quran. Allah 
Almighty has ordained the Muslims to decide their all 
disputes including issue of inheritance as per the principles 
of the Holy Quran as described in following verses: 
ا ور وج ہلصیف ہن رکے اس (اتکب) ےک اطمقب ےسج انزل رفامای اہلل ےن وت وُیہ ولگ اکرف ںیہ۔﴿
 وسرۃ اآملدئۃ : آتی ربمن۴۴
﴾
 
ا ور
وج ہلصیف ہن رکے اس (اتکب) ےک اطمقب ےسج ااترا اہلل ےن وت وُیہ ولگ اظمل ںیہ ۔﴿ 
 وسرۃ اآملدئۃ : آتی ربمن۴۵
﴾
 
ا ور
وج ہلصیف ہن رکںی اس ےک اطمقب ےسج اہلل اعتٰیل ےن اُاترا ےہ وت وُیہ ولگ افقس ںیہ۔ ﴿ 
 وسرۃ اآملدئۃ : آتی ربمن۴۷
 ﴾
 
)(رتہمج: انجب ومالان حتف دمحم اجدنلرھی 
 
The rights or shares of each and every Muslim heirs in the 
estate of his/her deceased propositus is absolutely, 
conclusively and finally described/determined in the Holy 
Quran, which shares are definite in nature. In this regard, it 
is expedient to take guidance from the Holy Quran, 
particularly from Surah tul Nisa Ayat Nos.7 to 11 (English 
translation whereof by Marmaduke Pickthall and Urdu 

Civil Revision No.164468/2018 
8 
 
 
translation by Molana Fateh Muhammad Jalandari) are 
reproduced as under:- 
7. Unto the men (of a family) belongeth a share of that 
which parents and near kindred leave, and unto the 
women a share of that which parents and near kindred 
leave, whether it be little or much. A legal share. 
8. And when kinsfolk and orphans and the needy are 
present at the division (of the heritage), bestow on them 
therefrom and speak kindly unto them. 
9. And let those fear (in their behaviour toward orphans) 
who if they left behind them weak offspring would be 
afraid for them. So let them mind their duty to Allah, and 
speak justly. 
10. Lo! Those who devour the wealth of orphans 
wrongfully, they do but swallow fire into their bellies. 
And they will be exposed to burning flame. 
11. Allah commands you concerning (the provision for) 
your children; to the male the equivalent of the portion of 
two females, and if there be only women more than two, 
then theirs is two-thirds of the inheritance, and if there 
be one (only) then for her is the half. And to each of his 
parents a sixth of the inheritance, if he have a son; and if 
he have no son and his parents are his heirs, then to his 
mother appertaineth the third; but if he have brethren, 
then to his mother appertaineth the sixth, after any 
legacy he may have bequeathed, or debt (hath been 
paid). Your parents and your children: Ye know not 
which of them is nearer unto you in usefulness. It is an 
injunction from Allah. Lo! Allah is knower, Wise.

Further in respect of inheritance of a deceased bachelor / 
spinster Muslim (male/female) in Surah tul Nisa, Ayat 
No.176, it has been ordered as under:-

Reliance in this regard is placed on cases titled as The 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Law & 
Parliamentary Affairs, Islamabad vs. Muhammad Ishaq and 
another (PLD 1983 SC 273), Abdul Ghafoor and others Vs. 
Muhammad Shafi and others (PLD 1985 SC 407), Mst. 
Fazal Jan Vs. Roshan Din and others (PLD 1990 SC 661), 
Ismail and another Vs. Ghulam Qadir and others (1990 
SCMR 1667), Sardar Vs. Mst. Nehmat Bi and 8 others 
(1992 SCMR 82), Muhammad Yousaf through Legal Heirs 
and 2others Vs. Mst. Karam Khatoon through Legal Heirs 
and 2 others (2003 SCMR 1535), Ghulam Haider and 
others Vs. Murad through Legal Representatives and others 
(PLD 2012 SC 501), Fayyaz Hussain and others Vs. Haji 
Jan Muhammad and others (2018 SCMR 698), Ghulam 
Qasim and others Vs. Mst. Razia Begum and others (PLD 

Civil Revision No.164468/2018 
10 
 
 
2021 SC 812), Abdul Khaliq (deceased) through LRs. Vs. 
Fazalur Rehman and others (2022 SCMR 1665) and 
Manzoor Hussain (deceased) through Legal Heirs and 
others Vs. Muhammad Rafique and others (2020 CLC 400). 
Reliance is also placed on the case cited as Gul Muhammad 
& Others Vs Allah Diwaya (deceased) through his Legal 
Heirs & Others (2021 MLD 1146). 
9. 
Furthermore, the petitioner/Manzoor is real uterine 
brother of deceased Mst. Nooran and it is settled law that 
when a real brother of a deceased issueless spinster lady is 
alive, he is entitled to inherit the entire estate of the deceased 
and the paternal uncle or his successors are not entitled to 
inherit any share. Reliance in this regard is placed on cases 
cited as Saadullah and Others Vs. Mst. Gulbanda and Others 
(2014 SCMR 1205), Waris Ali and Others Vs. Rasoolan Bibi 
(PLD 2014 SC 779), Muhammad Sharif Vs. Mst. Niamat 
Bibi (2021 SCMR 1355) and Shahray Khan (deceased) 
through LRs. and others Vs. Qadir Bakhsh (deceased) 
through LRs. and others (2023 SCMR 201). 
10.  
So far as the controversy of date of death of Mst. 
Nooran is concerned, suffice it to say that record shows that 
Chiragh Khan etc., did not prove that Mst. Nooran died on 
10.06.1998, as only the death certificate was produced in 
evidence in the statement of the learned counsel for the 
plaintiffs and the said document has no intrinsic value and by 

Civil Revision No.164468/2018 
11 
 
 
exclusion of the said document from judicial consideration, 
there is nothing on the record to show that Mst. Nooran died 
on 10.06.1998 which falw leads to hold that plaintiff/ 
respondents have failed to prove their stance. Further, 
respondents No.1 & 2/plaintiffs challenged the inheritance 
mutation No.294 before DDOR on the plea that it was 
incorporated on the basis of fraud and concealment of true 
fact  but in this regard no credible  evidence was produced. 
Thus, the reasoning expounded by the lower judicial fora has 
no consonance with the facts of this case and same suffers 
from perversity.    
11.  
Moreover, copy of Jamabandi for the years 1999-2000 
(Exh.P1), copy of mutation No.294 dated 20.07.2000 
(Exh.P3) and death certificate of Nooran (Exh.P5) were 
produced in the statement of learned counsel for the 
respondents/plaintiffs which is considered as an invalid mode 
of tendering of documents and same are inadmissible in 
evidence, as such the documents produced by the 
respondents’ counsel cannot be relied upon as valid evidence 
and such documents could not be taken into consideration. 
Reliance is placed on the case title Mst. Akhtar Sultana Vs. 
Major Retd. Muzaffar Khan Malik through his legal heirs 
and others (PLD 2021 SC 715). Similar view has been 
reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in its 
latest judgment cited as Rustam & Others Vs. Jehangir 

Civil Revision No.164468/2018 
12 
 
 
(deceased) through LRs (2023 SCMR 730) wherein it is held 
as under:- 
7. As regards the other two documents i.e. 
mutation 
No.1836 
(Exh.D-9) 
and 
mutation 
No.1837 (Exh.D-8), it is suffice to say that 
according to principle settled by this Court in the 
cases reported as Mst. Hameeda Begum and others 
v. Mst. Irshad Begum and others (2007 SCMR 
996), Federation of Pakistan through Secretary 
Ministry of Defence and another v Jaffar Khan 
and others (PLD 2010 SC 604), Province of the 
Punjab through Collector. Sheikhupura and others 
v. Syed Ghazanfar Ali Shah and others (2017 
SCMR 172) the document should be produced in 
the evidence by the party itself and a fair 
opportunity should be given to the opposite party 
to cross-examine the same, as such, the said two 
documents produced by the defendants counsel in 
his 
statement 
could 
not 
be 
taken 
into 
consideration." 
12.  
As the decisions of the lower fora on issue Nos.1 to 3 
suffer from blatant misreading and non-reading of the 
evidence as well as mis-application of law, as such the 
findings of both the courts below on issue Nos.1 to 3 being 
against the record, are hereby reversed and the same are 
decided in favour of the petitioner and against the 
respondents/plaintiffs. This Court is well within jurisdiction 
to reverse such illegal and perverse concurrent findings of the 
lower fora in its revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 
CPC. Reliance is placed on the cases titled as Nazim-ud-Din 
& Others Vs. Sheikh Zia-Ul-Qamar & Others (2016 SCMR 
24). 
13. 
In view of above, this civil revision is allowed. 
Consolidated judgment & decree dated 17.10.2014 passed by 

Civil Revision No.164468/2018

the learned Civil Judge, Kamalia as well as judgment & 
decree dated 11.12.2017 passed by the learned Addl. District 
Judge, Pir Mahal are hereby set aside and suit for declaration 
filed by the petitioner is hereby decreed whereas suit for 
declaration filed by the respondents is dismissed. No order as 
to costs.
