W.P.No.355 of 2023 
 
Ahsan Nawaz 
Vs. 
Judge Family Court, etc.

Date of hearing 
15.03.2023 
Petitioner By: 
Mahar Ghulam Shabbir Aaheer, Advocate 
Respondents By: Mr. M. Shakeel Anjum, Advocate. 
 
 
Faisal Zaman Khan, J:-  Through this petition, judgment and 
decree dated 18.10.2022 passed by respondent No.1 has been 
assailed, by virtue of which a suit for recovery of maintenance 
allowance and dower filed by respondent No.2 against the petitioner 
has been decreed to the extent of maintenance allowance. 
2. 
Facts giving rise to the present petition are that Nikah between 
the petitioner and respondent No.2 was solemnized on 30.01.2018, 
however, the Rukhsati never took place. Since the petitioner neither 
endeavored to ask for Rukhsati nor performed his marital 
obligations/conjugal rights for a long time, therefore, a suit for 
recovery of maintenance allowance and dower was filed by 
respondent No.2 against the petitioner in which the latter filed his 
written statement. Out of divergent pleadings of the parties, 04 
issues were framed, evidence pro and contra was led, whereafter, 
through judgment and decree dated 18.10.2022 the suit was decreed 
to the extent of maintenance allowance, therefore, this petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that since marriage 
between the spouses was not consummated as no Rukhsati had taken 

W.P.No.355 of 2023 
2 
place, therefore, respondent No.2 was not entitled to any 
maintenance allowance. 
4. 
Replying to the above, learned counsel for respondent No.2 
supports the impugned judgment and decree.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6. 
The question which requires determination by this Court is 
that where a Nikah between the spouses has been performed, 
however, the marriage is not consummated as the Rukhsati has not 
taken place, in such an eventuality, whether a wife is entitled to 
maintenance allowance? 
7. 
Under section 5 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 
(Ordinance), every marriage solemnized under the Act has to be 
registered and once a man and a woman enters into a marital bond 
they become HUSBAND and WIFE. Section 9 of the Ordinance 
spells out that where a HUSBAND fails to maintain his WIFE, she 
in addition to seeking other legal remedies (as contemplated in West 
Pakistan Family Courts Act 1964) can also seek maintenance 
allowance. It shall not be out of place to mention here that no 
condition of Rukhasti or consummation of marriage has been 
mentioned therein. 
8. 
Section 9 of the Ordinance has been interpreted by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in judgment reported as “Muhammad 
Najeeb v. Mst. Talat Shahnaz and others” (1989 SCMR 119) 
wherein it has been held that for the purposes of recovery of 
maintenance allowance, the said provision makes reference to a 
HUSBAND and a WIFE and does not refer to the fact that whether 
marriage between them has been consummated or Rukhsati has 
taken place. 
9. 
While further elaborating the above concept in judgments 
reported as “Muhammad Arif v. Additional Sessions Judge-VIII, 
Karachi West and 2 others” (2020 YLR 1586) and “Khudai Noor v. 

W.P.No.355 of 2023 
3 
District Judge, Pishin and 2 others” (2017 YLR 2349) and “Mst. 
Shamim Akhtar v. Additional District Judge, Sialkot and another” 
(1991 CLC 1142), it has been held that the claim of maintenance by 
the 
WIFE 
is 
not 
conditional 
with 
the 
RUKHSATI 
or 
CONSUMATION of marriage. It has also been elaborated that in 
such circumstances the conduct of the spouses will be of utmost 
importance while granting a claim of maintenance. 
10. 
In a latest judgment passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
reported as Haseen Ullah v. Mst. Naheed Begum and others (PLD 
2022 SC 686), in paragraph No.7 it has been held as follows:- 
“A wife who is willing to, but cannot, discharge her marital 
obligations for no fault of her own, rather is prevented to do 
so by any act or omission of her husband is legally entitled 
to receive her due maintenance from her husband, and the 
latter cannot benefit from his own wrong.” 
 
11. 
Keeping the above in view, a perusal of the plaint would show 
that Nikah was solemnized between the spouses on 30.01.2018, 
however, since the petitioner was not taking any further action, as he 
neither was asking for Rukhsati, nor was performing his marital 
obligations/conjugal rights despite the fact that respondent No.2 was 
willing to do the same, thus, due to delinquency on part of the 
petitioner, she became entitled to maintenance allowance, hence she 
rightly filed the suit on 15.07.2021 seeking maintenance allowance.  
12. 
Oppose to the above, as per written statement filed by the 
petitioner delay caused in Rukhsati has been attributed to the family 
of respondent No.2.  
13. 
In the above backdrop, since it was imperative for the 
petitioner to have proved that he was not at fault as it was his 
contention that it was the parents of respondent No.2 who had been 
delaying the Rukhsati, hence the onus to prove the same was on him, 
however, a further perusal of the available record would show that 
no evidence, whatsoever, has been produced by the petitioner 
wherefrom this could be ascertained that he has been making efforts 

W.P.No.355 of 2023 
4 
to seek Rukhsati or to perform the marital obligations/conjugal 
rights. 
14. 
In view of the above factual matrix, it is clear and obvious 
that the delinquency as to not seeking Rukhsati or not performing 
the marital obligations/conjugal rights is on part of the petitioner as 
respondent No.2 was ready and willing to perform her marital 
obligations/conjugal rights being the lawfully wedded wife of the 
petitioner, thus, she has rightly been held entitled to maintenance 
allowance from the period when the Nikah was solemnized. 
15. 
Another aspect which further weakens the stance of the 
petitioner is that instead of approaching a court of law for seeking 
performance of conjugal rights, he without any reason and after two 
years of Nikah divorced respondent No.3 on 18.12.2020  
16. 
For what has been discussed above, since the learned counsel 
for the petitioner has not been able to highlight any jurisdictional 
defect or procedural impropriety in the impugned judgment and 
decree, therefore, no ground for interference is made out, as a sequel 
to which, this petition fails and the same is dismissed.
