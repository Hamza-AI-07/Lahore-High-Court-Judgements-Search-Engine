      Anwaar Hussain, J.   Through this Civil Revision under 
Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”), challenge 
has been laid to orders passed by learned Trial Court in suit instituted by 
the petitioner for recovery of money under Order XXXVII Rules 1 & 2, 
CPC against the respondent. Through order dated 18.05.2022, the 
petitioner’s application under Order XVI, Rule 1, CPC for allowing the 
petitioner to submit list of witnesses beyond 07-days period stipulated 
under the law was dismissed as the petitioner failed to show sufficient 
cause. Thereafter, another application was filed for summoning certain 
bank officials, which application was also dismissed through order dated 
07.07.2022.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that both orders are 
erroneous and while placing reliance upon case reported as Amjad Khan 
v. Muhammad Irshad (deceased) through L.Rs (2020 SCMR 2155) 
contends that the object of Order XVI, CPC is that the opposite party is 

 
C.R. No.507 of 2022

not taken by surprise regarding the witnesses who are to appear against 
him and not to penalize the litigant, who fails to submit the list within 
stipulated time.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has supported the 
impugned findings.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
The law on the subject is clear inasmuch as Order XVI Rule 1, CPC 
contemplates that once the issues are framed, list of witnesses is to be 
submitted within a period of 07-days and it is for the Court to extend the 
time provided sufficient cause is shown. An application was moved by 
the petitioner for submission of list of witnesses beyond the said period, 
however, through impugned order dated 18.05.2022, while placing 
reliance upon case reported Muhammad Anwar and others v. Mst. Ilyas 
Begum and others (PLD 2013 SC 255), the Trial Court found that no 
good cause has been shown and hence, dismissed the said application. 
Operative part of the impugned order dated 18.05.2022, reads under: 
“This application is the subject of Order 16 Rule 1 CPC. 
Object of O.XVI, R.I(l), C.P.C was to bind the parties to such 
genuine evidence which was available to them at the time of 
the start of the trial, so that they should not subsequently 
avail stock and fudge evidence to make up their cases and the 
deficiencies. In the instant case issued (sic) were framed on 
08.11.2021. The plain reading of Order 16 Rule 1 CPC 
reveals that after the settlement of issues the filing of list of 
witnesses within seven days is mandatory. The word used in 
Order 16 Rule 2 is “good cause” for the omission to file the 
list of witnesses. Scanning, of the application filed by the 
plaintiff before this court on 29.11.2021, envisages that it has 
been alleged by the plaintiff/petitioner that he submitted the 
list of witnesses on 11.11.2021 through clerk to the reader of 
the court, who/reader informed that the Presiding Officer is 
on leave, therefore, he/clerk was advised by the reader to 
submit the list of witnesses on the next date. In para No.2 of 
the application it has been further mentioned that the clerk 
did not told (sic) this fact to the learned counsel for the 
plaintiff/petitioner but I am not in agreement with this 

 
C.R. No.507 of 2022                                                             
 
           - 3 - 
 
 
contention of the plaintiff because if (sic) on 11.11.2021 the 
undersigned was not on leave. On 11.11.2021 the list of 
witnesses on behalf of defendant was filed and the 
undersigned fixed the case for filing of list of witnesses on 
behalf of plaintiff for 15.11.2021. On 15.11.2021 it was the 
last day for the plaintiff to submit the list of witnesses as the 
issues were framed on 08.11.2021. On 15.11.2021 the 
undersigned was on leave but admittedly the learned Duty 
Judge was available. The instant application has been filed on 
29.11.2021 and infact a concocted story has been planted in 
para No.2 of the application. Where law required an act to be 
done in a particular manner, it had to be done in that manner 
alone and such dictate of law could not be termed as 
technicality.”  
 
Instead of challenging the above-quoted order, within stipulated 
period of time, the petitioner filed a second application and prayed that 
some officials of Muslim Commercial Bank Branch, 42/DB Adda, Tehsil 
Yazman and JS Bank Ltd., Mandi Branch Bahawalpur alongwith relevant 
record be summoned. In the second application, the petitioner clearly 
acknowledged that his earlier application has been dismissed and the 
dismissal order has not been challenged. The subsequent application was 
dismissed through impugned order dated 07.07.2022 in the following 
terms: 
“In the application in para No.2 the plaintiff has himself 
mentioned that previously his application for filing of list of 
witnesses has been dismissed on 18.05.2022. Perusal of the 
order sheet reflects that on 18.05.2022 the application for 
filing of list of witnesses was dismissed. In the said list of 
witnesses the plaintiff has not mentioned the name of bank 
officials. It appears that the application filed by the plaintiff 
on 20.06.2022 is in fact to fulfill the lacunas. The application 
filed by the plaintiff on 20.06.2022 has not been filed within 
stipulated period. In these circumstances, the application filed 
by the plaintiff on 20.06.2022 is hereby dismissed. To come 
up for evidence of plaintiff with last and final opportunity on 
27.07.2022.” 
 
When confronted as to how the second application for submission 
of list of witnesses was maintainable, learned counsel for the petitioner 
contends that this was not the second application, under Order XVI, Rule 

 
C.R. No.507 of 2022                                                             
 
           - 4 - 
 
 
1 but an application under Order XVI Rule 14, CPC. Before proceeding 
further and addressing arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner, it 
will be appropriate to reproduce Order XVI Rule 14, CPC that reads as 
under: 
“14. Court may of its own accord summon as witnesses 
strangers to suit.--Subject to the provisions of this Code as to 
attendance and appearance and to any law for the time being 
in force, where the Court at any time thinks it necessary to 
examine any person other than a party to the suit and not 
called as a witness by a party to the suit, the Court may, of its 
own motion, cause such person to be summoned as a witness 
to give evidence, or to produce any document in his 
possession, on a day to be appointed, and may examine him 
as a witness or require him to produce such document.” 
6. 
The petitioner asserts that the underlying purpose of Order XVI 
Rule 1, CPC is to ensure that no party is taken by surprise at the time of 
recording of evidence. Yet, this very purpose stands negated by the 
petitioner’s own conduct. When the petitioner failed to submit the 
witnesses list within the statutory period of seven days and the first 
application for extension of time was dismissed, the proper course 
available to the petitioner was to immediately challenge that order i.e., 
18.05.2022 before the appropriate forum, demonstrating that sufficient 
cause did indeed exist. Instead of doing so, the petitioner chose a 
different route and filed an entirely new application seeking summoning 
of the bank officials—individuals whose names were not included even 
in the list annexed with the first application. When the first application 
neither contained the names of bank officials nor set out any justification 
for their production, the subsequent attempt to bring them in through a 
fresh application, albeit under a different provision, appears nothing 
more than an effort to cure the petitioner’s own procedural lapses. The 
argument that these officials are now “necessary” and that their absence 
would cause prejudice cannot retroactively validate what was never 
pleaded in the first application. If they were truly essential witnesses, 
their names should have appeared in the first list, or at the very least, the 

 
C.R. No.507 of 2022                                                             
 
           - 5 - 
 
 
petitioner should have sought revisional intervention against the earlier 
dismissal order dated 18.05.2022.  
7. 
It is imperative to observe that Order XVI Rule 14 CPC is not a 
device for parties to fill gaps in their evidence. It vests a discretionary, 
suo motu power in the Court, which may be exercised if the Court itself 
finds a person necessary for effective adjudication even though such 
person is stranger. It is not intended to compensate for negligence or 
allow a litigant to expand the record after procedural time limits have 
expired. In these circumstances, allowing such applications would defeat 
the statutory discipline of Order XVI, Rule 1; undermine the requirement 
of timely disclosure, and open the door for parties to repeatedly repair 
their omissions. The discretion under Order XVI Rule 14 squarely 
belongs to the Court, which may call any stranger on its own assessment; 
it cannot be demanded as a matter of right by a party that has failed to 
comply with Rule 1 of Order XVI, CPC.  
8. 
In view of above discussion, the present petition is devoid of any 
merit and hence, dismissed.
