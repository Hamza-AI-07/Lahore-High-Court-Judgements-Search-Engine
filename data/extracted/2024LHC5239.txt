MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. The petitioners herein are the 
successors-in-interest of Akhtar Gul, who was owner of the property 
measuring 8 Kanal 11 Marla forming part of Khasra Nos.2818, 2819, 
2826 & 2827 situated in the revenue estate of Sarwala Tehsil and 
District Attock (hereinafter referred to as “suit property”). The 
respondents No.3 to 5 instituted a suit for declaration and injunction 
averring therein that suit property was sold by the predecessor-in-
interest of the petitioners to respondent No.1 (hereinafter referred to 
as “respondent”) through an agreement to sell dated 4th February, 
1999 with sale consideration of Rs.1,55,000/- and in furtherance 
thereof, he also executed a general power of attorney in favour of 
respondent No.2. It is asserted that respondent was since settled 

Civil Revision No.663-D of 2012 
-2- 
 
abroad, so before leaving the country he executed a special power of 
attorney in favour of respondent No.2. As per averments contained in 
the plaint, respondents No.3 to 5 entered into a sale transaction with 
respondent No.2 in lieu of sale consideration of Rs.3,00,000/- to 
which effect agreement dated 10th May, 1999 was executed. It is 
asserted that as the sale consideration was paid entirely, so 
respondents No.3 to 5 when contacted respondent No.2 for execution 
of sale deed, it transpired that predecessor-in-interest of the 
petitioners has revoked the general power of attorney executed in 
favour of respondent and in this way registered sale deed could not 
be executed in their favour. Suit for specific performance was also 
instituted by respondent against predecessor-in-interest of the 
petitioners, seeking enforcement of terms and conditions of the 
agreement to sell dated 4th February, 1999 alongwith injunction. 
Both the suits were contested by predecessor-in-interest of the 
petitioners, who submitted his written statement controverting the 
assertions contained in the plaints. From the divergent pleadings of 
the parties, necessary issues were framed whereafter evidence of 
both the sides was recorded separately in both the suits. Suits were, 
however, finally consolidated and through consolidated judgment 
dated 19th April, 2011 same were decreed. Feeling dissatisfied the 
petitioners preferred an appeal before the learned Additional District 
Judge, Attock but of no avail, as their appeal was dismissed vide 
judgment and decree dated 20th June, 2012, hence this petition under 
Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter 
referred to as “C.P.C.”). 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that both the 
suits were tried separately, however, at the time of pronouncement of 
judgment, suits were consolidated in an illegal and unlawful manner. 
It is argued with vehemence that execution of agreement to sell was 
specifically denied by predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners and 
as such respondent was bound to prove the same. Learned counsel 
contended that attesting witnesses of the agreement to sell were not 
produced. It is further contended that suit for specific performance 

Civil Revision No.663-D of 2012 
-3- 
 
was thus decreed in an illegal and unlawful manner. Learned counsel 
emphasized that the claim of respondents No.3 to 5 rested upon 
agreement to sell purportedly executed in favour of the respondent. 
He added that when respondent failed to prove the execution of 
agreement to sell, the claim of respondents No.3 to 5 would 
automatically crumble down. Learned counsel contended that though 
a deed of attorney was executed by predecessor-in-interest of the 
petitioners in favour of the respondent but it was revoked even prior 
to the institution of the suit and as such suit instituted by the 
respondent through attorney was not proceedable at all. Learned 
counsel emphatically argued that findings of the two courts are 
though concurrent but are tainted with material irregularities. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondents No.1 & 2 
submitted that predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners initially 
executed a general attorney in favour of the respondent, which 
followed the agreement to sell. It is contended that as agreement to 
sell was coupled with attorney, so deed of attorney became 
irrevocable. Learned counsel argued that the suit was rightly decreed 
and concurrent findings are unexceptionable. 
4. 
 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.3 to 5 
submitted that they purchased suit property from respondent No.2, 
who was special attorney on behalf of the respondent. It is 
contended that respondents No.3 to 5 have led ample evidence to 
prove their case. Learned counsel submitted that findings of the two 
courts are rested upon proper appraisal of evidence and this petition 
is not maintainable. 
5. 
Heard. Record perused. 
6. 
It is an admitted fact that suit property is originally owned by 
Akhtar Gul, predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners. In that 
capacity, the predecessor-in-interest executed general attorney 
(Exhibit-P2) in favour of the respondent, who statedly was real 
estate agent, on his assurance that he would sell the suit property at 
a better rate but it could only be done when he would be holding a 

Civil Revision No.663-D of 2012 
-4- 
 
deed of attorney on behalf of actual owner. As per stance of 
predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners, deed of attorney was 
executed in favour of respondent on his assurance that he will not 
misuse the deed of attorney and whenever he succeeded to get the 
reasonable buyer, he would settle the deal in presence of principal 
but on betraying by the agent (respondent), the general attorney was 
cancelled on 10th May, 1999, which fact is also not in dispute interse 
parties. 
7. 
The whole edifice of the respective claims of the respondents 
is rested upon agreement to sell dated 4th February, 1999 (Exhibit-
P1) purportedly executed by predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners 
in favour of the respondent. Perusal whereof reveals that it was 
attested by Javed Iqbal and Inayat Hussain but none of them was 
produced by the respondent to prove the genuineness of the 
agreement to sell. In terms of Article 79 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984 if a document is required by law to be attested, it shall 
not be used as evidence until two attesting witnesses at least have 
been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be two 
attesting witnesses alive and subject to the process of the Court and 
capable of giving evidence. The respondent thus in view of Article 
79 ibid was bound to examine two marginal witnesses of the 
agreement in order to prove the same. There can be thus no second 
opinion that agreement to sell (Exhibit-P1) was not proved at all by 
the respondents. Reference in this respect, if needed can be made to 
FARZAND ALI and another versus KHUDA BAKHSH and others (PLD 2015 
Supreme Court 187) wherein it was held as under :- 
“10. 
Considering the proposition if the agreement of the 
appellants was required to be proved by the examination of two 
attesting witnesses, it is settled law that an agreement to sell an 
immovable property squarely falls within the purview of the 
provisions of Article 17(2) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 and has to be compulsorily attested by the two witnesses 
and this is sine qua non for the validity of the agreement. For 
the purposes of proof of such agreement it is mandatory that 
two attesting witnesses must be examined by the party to the lis 
as per Article 79 of the Order ibid. In this case, the respondent 
had unequivocally denied the execution of the said agreement 
and it is on account of the above that issue No.11 was also 
framed requiring, the appellants to prove their agreement; the 
appellants never objected to the issue or sought to get it struck 

Civil Revision No.663-D of 2012 
-5- 
 
off; thus for all intents and purposes they accepted the 
responsibility of proving the same, despite the fact that 
according to their stance now the said agreement was admitted 
by the vendors in their written statement. However, the 
appellants for this purpose produced P.W.1 who is the scribe of 
the document, but admittedly is not the attesting witness and in 
number of judgments of this court it has been clearly held, that 
a scribe of an agreement to sell immovable property is not a 
substitute for an attesting witness, and does not legally qualify 
to be so, therefore, his evidence may have a supportive value, 
but is neither in line with the mandate of law nor does it meet 
the test of Article 79 ibid. The only attesting witness examined 
by the appellants is D.W.2, namely, Muhammad Hanif, 
whereas the other attesting witness, Aftab has not been 
examined, and no explanation has been given by the appellants 
for this vital omission which was essential for proving their 
agreement to sell. This is fatal to the case of the appellants as 
per the law laid down in Hafiz Tassaduq Hussain v. 
Muhammad Din through Legal Heirs and others (PLD 2011 
SC 241).” 
8. 
It is though one of the contentions of learned counsel for the 
respondent that as the power of attorney was coupled with 
agreement to sell, so it becomes irrevocable but to this effect neither 
any claim was made by either of the respondents in their respective 
plaints nor they have called in question the validity of the deed of 
cancellation resulting into cancellation of general power of attorney. 
Even otherwise when the respondent failed to prove the very 
agreement to sell (Exhibit-P1) he is precluded to assert that the 
general attorney was irrevocable. 
9. 
So far respondents No.3 to 5 are concerned, as per their stance 
they purchased the suit property from respondent No.2, being the 
special attorney on behalf of the respondent. Though they have 
produced one of the attesting witnesses of the agreement to sell 
(Exhibit-P1) namely Javed Iqbal in support of their claim but this 
would not be sufficient enough to pave wave for their claim. The 
respondent No.2 was appointed as special attorney by the 
respondent on the basis of general power of attorney (Exhibit-P2) 
but with the cancellation of that, respondent No.2 would be left with 
no right or authority to alienate the suit property in favour of 
respondents No.3 to 5. As per stance of respondents No.3 to 5 in 
their plaint, they entered into sale transaction with respondent No.2 
on 10th May, 1999, which leaves no doubt that the alleged sale 

Civil Revision No.663-D of 2012 
-6- 
 
transaction took place on the date when the general power of 
attorney was cancelled by predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners. 
Even otherwise when the respondent failed to prove the agreement 
to sell in his favour, respondents No.3 to 5 would be precluded to 
claim any right or interest in the suit property on the basis of any 
transaction, which is an offshoot of such agreement to sell or the 
deed of attorney, which was no more in field at the relevant time. 
10. 
There is yet another important aspect that suit for specific 
performance was instituted by the respondent through his attorney 
(respondent No.2) on 13th May, 1999 whereas the general power of 
attorney was already cancelled on 10th May, 1999, so in that 
eventuality special power of attorney on the basis of which 
respondent No.2 instituted the suit was no more in field as such suit 
was not proceedable at all but this important aspect has not been 
taken into consideration by either of the courts, while decreeing the 
suit.  
11. 
It is quite strange that though initially suits were proceeded 
independently but at the time of announcement of judgment both 
were consolidated and through a common judgment while 
intermingling the evidence recorded in both the suits these were 
decreed. There are though concurrent findings of facts recorded by 
two courts but in view of discussion recorded hereinabove these are 
clearly the outcome of gross misreading and non-reading of 
evidence. The scope of revisional jurisdiction is hedged in Section 
115 of the C.P.C. and though ordinarily concurrent findings of facts 
are not disturbed but such findings are neither sacrosanct nor it is an 
inflexible rule that despite observing material flaws, the revisional 
court will abdicate to exercise its jurisdiction. The judgments passed 
by the courts below are not based on proper appraisal of evidence 
and the learned Civil Judge, while decreeing the suits of the 
respondents has grossly misread the evidence as already noted 
hereinabove. The appellate court in the circumstances, while 
upholding the judgment and decree of trial court thus committed a 
material irregularity. This Court under Section 115 of the C.P.C. is 

Civil Revision No.663-D of 2012 
-7- 
 
thus obliged and fully competent to correct such error in exercise of 
its revisional jurisdiction. Needless to observe that when once it is 
established on the record that concurrent findings are fraught with 
legal infirmities, it becomes the bounden duty of court exercising 
revisional powers to curb and stifle such illegalities and material 
irregularities. Reference in this respect, if needed, can be made to 
Malik MUHAMMAD KHAQAN versus TRUSTEES OF THE PORT OF 
KARACHI (KPT) and another (2008 SCMR 428) and IMAM DIN and 4 others 
versus BASHIR AHMED and 10 others (PLD 2005 Supreme Court 418). 
12. 
For the foregoing reasons, the instant petition is allowed, 
impugned judgments and decrees are set aside, as a result thereof, 
suits instituted by the respondents shall stand dismissed with no 
order as to costs.
