Punjab along with Fayyaz S.I.  
 
  
This petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 has been filed with the following prayer: - 
“In view of the aforementioned, it is humbly prayed 
that impugned orders order bear No.786 dated 10.05.2023 
and order bearing No.788 dated 10.05.2023 of the real 
brothers of the petitioner namely Abdul Rehman and Nasir 
Malak passed by Deputy commissioner Gujrat/respondent 
No.2 may kindly be quashed and the detenues be directed to 
be released forthwith, in the interest of justice. 
Any other relief which this Honourable Court deems 
fit and proper may also be awarded.” 
 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that real brothers of the 
petitioner namely “Abdul Rehman alias Mooni and Nasir Malik” have 
been arrested and detained vide aforementioned impugned orders passed 
under sub section 1 of Section: 3 of the West Pakistan Maintenance of 
Public Order Ordinance, 1960 (Amendment 2017) for a period of 30-days 
by Deputy Commissioner, Gujrat/respondent No.2; further adds that there 
is no evidence/material available against them to show that they were acting 
or were about to act in a manner which was prejudicial to public safety or 
maintenance of public order; also adds that respondent No.2 has passed the 
impugned orders (mentioned above) merely on the basis of asking/ 
recommendations of District Police Officer, Gujrat/respondent No.3 and 
without application of his own mind; finally prays that aforementioned 
impugned orders are against the law as well as facts of the case, therefore, 
same are liable to be set-aside.  
3. 
On the other hand, learned Additional Advocate General, Punjab 
assisted by learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab while producing 
report & parawise comments to this petition prepared by Deputy 
Commissioner, Gujrat/respondent No.2 as well as report and parawise 

          Writ Petition No.32503/2023        
 
 
 
             
        2 
                              
comments to this petition prepared by District Police Officer, Gujrat/ 
respondent No.3 (which have been placed on record of instant petition) and 
supporting the impugned orders submits that since detenues have not 
availed alternative/departmental remedy by filing representation before the 
Government of Punjab, therefore, instant petition is not maintainable; 
further submits that both aforementioned brothers of the petitioner are 
involved in case arising out of F.I.R. No.250 dated: 10.05.2023 registered 
under Sections: 341, 188, 147, 149 PPC at Police Station: Saddar Gujrat; 
finally adds that impugned orders are in accordance with law and instant 
petition is liable to be dismissed.  
4.   
Arguments heard and available record perused.  
5.   
As far as objection raised by learned Additional Advocate General, 
Punjab with respect to maintainability of instant petition due to non-filing 
of representation by the detenus before Government of Punjab, is 
concerned, suffice it to say that right to file petition of instant nature               
i.e. habeas corpus is remedy provided by the constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 in all matters of illegal confinement as one of 
fundamental rights; it goes without saying that if arrest of a person for the 
purpose of “Preventive Detention” cannot be justified in the eyes of law, 
then there is no reason that why said person should not invoke jurisdiction 
of this Court for his immediate release; in this regard, case of  
“Muhammad Irshad versus Government of the Punjab and others”  
(2020 P Cr.L J 206) can be advantageously referred; relevant portion from 
the same is hereby reproduced: - 
“I also do not agree with the learned Law Officer that prior to 
filing the writ petition against the order of detention, it is 
necessary to assail the same before the Secretary, Home 
Department, Lahore (Punjab). Reliance is placed on “Abdul Latif 
Shamshad Ahmad v. District Magistrate, Kasur” (1999 PCr.LJ 
2014) in which by tackling such legal observation the Hon’ble 
Bench observed as under: - 
 
“At the very outset I would express that before the filing 
of this writ petition, the making of the representation or 
preference of appeal before the Secretary Home 
Department, Government of the Punjab is not 
necessary. It has been held in Maulana Shah Ahmad 
Noorani v. Government of the Punjab PLD 1984 Lah. 
222 and Azad Papers (Jasarat) v. Province of Sindh 
and others PLD 1974 Kar. 81 that availability of 
alternate remedy of making representation to the 
provincial Government against the impugned order 
does not oust and eclipse the jurisdiction of the 

          Writ Petition No.32503/2023        
 
 
 
             
        3 
                              
Constitutional Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction 
in a matter of the instant nature. This objection of the 
learned Assistant Advocate General is overruled.” 
Reliance is also placed on the cases of “Mst. Sana Jamil v. 
Government of the Punjab through Secretary and 5 others” (2016 
PCr.LJ 424) and “Syed Mubbashar Raza v. Government of 
Punjab through Secretary Home Department and 2 others”  (PLD 
2015 Lahore 20). Keeping in view the law laid down in judgment 
supra the objection of the learned AAG is overruled.” 
 
Therefore, objection (mentioned above) is overruled and instant petition is 
maintainable.  
6.  
It has been noticed that Deputy Commissioner, Gujrat/respondent 
No.2 has passed the impugned orders No.786/HC(G) dated: 10.05.2023 and 
788/HC(G) dated: 10.05.2023 qua petitioner’s brothers namely Abdul 
Rehman alias Mooni and Nasir Malik, respectively under sub section 1 of 
Section: 3 of the West Pakistan Maintenance of Public order Ordinance, 
1960 (Amendment 2017) merely on the recommendations of District Police 
Officer, Gujrat/respondent No.3 and relevant portion of report & parawise 
comments submitted on behalf of Deputy Commissioner, Gujrat/respondent 
No.2 is reproduced for ready reference: -  
“Brief facts of the case are that District Police Officer, Gujrat vide 
his letter No. 8012/S, dated 10.05.2023 and No.8014/S, dated 
10.05.2023 (Annex-A & B) reported that Abdul Rehman @ Mooni 
and Nasir Malik sons of Muhammad Malik r/o Sama, Gujrat are 
zealous. They have evil design and may cause damage / loss to the 
lives as well as properties of general public and government. 
Hence, they could create law & order situation and disharmony in 
the area. He further reported that the SHO concerned expressed 
strong apprehension that if above named activists remains free, 
they may create any untoward Bituation in area. 
2. As recommended by the District Police Officer, Gujrat, Abdul 
Rehman @ Mooni and Nasir Malik sons of Muhammad Malik r/o 
Sama, Gujrat were detained vide this office order No. 786/HC(G), 
dated 10.05.2023 and No. 788/HC(G), dated 10.05.2023 (Annex-C 
& D) in District Jail, Gujrat under section 3 of the Punjab 
Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960 for 30 days.” 
 
Similarly, relevant portion of the report of District Police Officer, 
Gujrat/respondent No.3, is also reproduced below: - 
“2.  
It is further submitted that on receipt of the instant writ 
petition, report into the matter was sought from DSP/SDPO 
Lalamusa circle, Gujrat. As per his report, the SHO Police Station 
Sadar Gujrat moved the requests for the detention of Nasir and 
Abdul Rehman @ Mooni, both brothers of the instant petitioner. As 
per contents of the request, said Nasir and Abdul Rehman @ 
Mooni, brothers of petitioner, are miscreant. They have evil design 
and may cause damage/loss to the lives as well as properties of 
general public and government. Hence, they could create law & 

          Writ Petition No.32503/2023        
 
 
 
             
        4 
                              
order situation and disharmony in the area. The SHO has 
expressed strong apprehension that if above named activists 
remains free, they will deteriorate public peace & tranquility. 
3.  
On receipt of the above said applications of SHO Police 
Station Sadar Gujrat, requests were made to the Deputy 
Commissioner Gujrat/ Respondent No. 2 for the detention of said 
Nasir and Abdul Rehman @ Mooni. Consequently, Nasir and 
Abdul Rehman @ Mooni have been detained for 30 days u/s 3 of 
the Punjab Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960, vide 
order No. 788/HC(G), dated 10.05.2023 and 886/HC(G), dated 
10.05.2023 respectively by the Deputy Commissioner, Gujrat. 4. It 
is pertinent to mention here that the above said Nasir and Abdul 
Rehman @ Mooni have also been found involved in case FIR No. 
250 dated 10.05.2023 u/s 341/188/147/149 PPC PS Sadar 
Gujrat.” 
It is trite law that before passing detention order of a person under          
Section: 3 of the Ordinance ibid, the competent authority must have reasons 
to believe that said person within his territorial jurisdiction has acted, is 
acting or is about to act in a manner which is prejudicial to public safety or 
maintenance of public order; however, perusal of the available record 
reveals that allegations against the detenus are general in nature and any 
solid or cogent evidence/material in order to establish the same, was not 
produced before Deputy Commissioner, Gujrat/respondent No.2 at the time 
of passing impugned orders (mentioned above); it is also not out of place to 
mention here that except aforementioned asking/ recommendations of 
District Police Officer, Gujrat/respondent No.3, there is no material 
available against the detenus to establish that they were acting or were 
about to act in any manner, which was prejudicial to the public safety or 
maintenance of the public order. Learned Additional Advocate General, 
Punjab assisted by learned Assisted Advocate General, Punjab (on Court’s 
query) could not refer or produce any material to prove that detenus are 
members of any banned group, proscribed organization or involved in any 
anti-State activities. Even perusal of report of District Police Officer, Gujrat 
does not reflect any material to invoke sub-section (1) of Section: 3 of the 
Ordinance ibid except apprehensions. But mere apprehension without any 
valid reason and also not supported by any cogent material, cannot be 
allowed to be made basis for curtailing right/liberty or freedom of any 
citizen which is even otherwise guaranteed by the constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and so far as registration of case vide F.I.R. 
No.250 (mentioned above) against the detenus is concerned, suffice it to 
say that allegations levelled in said case are first to be established during 
investigation and then to be proved during trial and detenus will face 

          Writ Petition No.32503/2023        
 
 
 
             
        5 
                              
proceedings in the same separately as per law but in the circumstances, it 
cannot be per se  made basis for issuance of impugned detention orders and 
in this regard, Article 13 (a) of the constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 can be advantageously referred. It goes without saying that 
when law requires a thing to be done in a particular manner, it should have 
been done in that manner otherwise same would be deemed as illegal in the 
light of maxim “A communi observantia non est recedendum” and in 
this regard case of “Muhammad Zafar Iqbal versus Sadozai Khan and 
two others” (2021 YLR 1206) and case of “Maqsood Yameen versus 
R.P.O. Multan and others” (2015 PCr.LJ 923) can be referred. 
7.  
In view of what has been discussed above, it is crystal clear that the 
impugned detention orders No.786/HC(G) dated: 10.05.2023 and 
No.788/HC(G) dated: 10.05.2023 have been passed against the settled 
principles of law on the subject as well as relevant facts, therefore, same are 
set aside, and Abdul Rehman alias Mooni and Nasir Malik 
(detenus/brothers of the petitioner) are ordered to be released forthwith, if 
not required in any other case. Instant petition stands accepted.
