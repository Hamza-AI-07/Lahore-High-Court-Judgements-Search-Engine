Any other relief which this honourable court may deem fit and 
appropriate under the circumstances of the case may also be awarded to the

2. 
 
Brief however necessary facts for decision of instant 
petition are that petitioner filed application for post-arrest bail in the 
case through Khawaja Awais Mushtaq, Advocate before learned 
Sessions Judge, Sialkot on 27.07.2024 (copy of said application is 
available at pages No.19-21 of this petition), which was entrusted to 
Mr. Hidayat Ullah Shah, learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sialkot 
however same was withdrawn from said court without assigning any 
reason and dismissed as such vide order dated 01.08.2024 passed by 
Mr. Hidayat Ullah Shah, learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sialkot 
(copy of said order is available at page No.22 of this petition); relevant 
portion of said order is hereby reproduced:-  
 
“At the very outset, learned counsel for the petitioner has stated that 
for the time being he does not want to press this bail petition, however, the 
same may be filed later-on if needed, therefore, this bail petition may please 
be dismissed as withdrawn. In this regard, signatures of learned counsel for 
the petitioner have been obtained on the margin of order sheet. Hence, this 
bail petition is dismissed as having been withdrawn.” 
 
 
On the very next day i.e. 02.08.2024, second application 
was filed by the petitioner before learned Sessions Judge, Sialkot 
through the same counsel i.e. Khawaja Awais Mushtaq, Advocate 
however without mentioning in the same that just one day earlier i.e. on 
01.08.2024, first application filed by the petitioner in the case through 
same counsel has been dismissed as withdrawn, said second application

was entrusted to Mr. Muhammad Irfan Basra, learned Additional 
Sessions Judge, Sialkot, which was accepted and petitioner was 
allowed post-arrest bail vide order dated 08.08.2024 (copy of said order 
is available at pages No.27-28 of this petition); Khurshid Bibi, 
complainant (now respondent No.2 in the instant petition) filed 
application for re-calling of said order and cancellation of afore-
mentioned post-arrest bail, which application has been allowed vide 
order dated 29.10.2024 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Sialkot (copy of said order is available at pages No.39-40 of this 
petition); relevant portion of said order is hereby reproduced:- 
 
“Arguments on the application u/s 497(5) Cr.P.C. for 
cancellation of post arrest bail granted to the respondent No.1/accused 
Ehsan Ali by the learned predecessor court on 08.08.2024 in case FIR 
No.873/24 dated 26.05.2024 for the offence 302/324/34 PPC registered 
at P.S. Cantt, Sialkot have been heard, record perused. 
2. 
As per record, the respondent No.1/accused Ehsan Ali has been 
nominated in the case through supplementary statement of the 
complainant recorded on 26.05.2024 with a specific role of 
aiding/facilitating the principal accused in fleeing away from the place 
of occurrence after the commission of offence in his vehicle. Said vehicle 
has been recovered on pointation of the accused Ehsan Ali. He has also 
been found guilty by the I.O. during investigation and there is sufficient 
incriminating material available on record to connect him with the 
commission of alleged offence. 
3.  
The respondent No.1/accused Ehsan Ali moved his first post 
arrest bail application on 30.07.2024 which was entrusted to the court of 
Mr. Hadayat Ullah Shah, the then learned Addl: Sessions, Sialkot and 
the same was adjourned for 01.08.2024 for summoning of complainant 
and record. On 01.08.2024, in view of the statement of learned counsel 
for the accused/petitioner regarding withdrawal of the petition, the bail 
application of the respondent No.1/accused was dismissed as withdrawn. 
Very next date i.e 02.08.2024 second post arrest bail application of the 
respondent No. 1/accused Ehsan Ali was moved while concealing the 
factum of his first post arrest bail application which stood dismissed as 
withdrawn on 01.08.2024 and without annexing the copy of order on his 
previous bail application. The bail application was entrusted to the court 
of Mr. Muhammad Irfan Basra, the then learned Addl: Sessions Judge, 
Sialkot which was later on granted on 08.08.2024. It is apparent from 
the record that notices were not served upon the complainant and the 
second bail application of respondent No.1/accused Ehsan Ali was 
granted in absence of the complainant. Perusal of record also reveals 
that during arguments, the learned counsel for the respondent 
No.1/accused Ehsan Ali did not inform the court about the order on the 
previous bail application of the respondent No.1/accused Ehsan Ali. 
Hence it appears that bail granting order of the respondent 
No.1/accused Ehsan Ali was obtained while keeping the court in dark 
about his previous bail application and the order on the said application. 
4.  
For what has been discussed, the respondent No.1/accused 
Ehsan Ali while playing fraud with the court and hampering the court 
proceedings, managed to obtain bail granting order in his favour which 
is not warranted by law. Therefore, strong grounds are available for 
cancellation of bail granted to the respondent No.1/accused Ehsan Ali by 
the learned predecessor of this court. Resultantly, the application in 

                         Crl. Revision No.72289/2024     
 
 
 
           3 
 
 
hand is allowed the bail granting order dated 08.08.2024 passed by the 
learned predecessor court in favour of the respondent No.1/accused 
Ehsan Ali stands recalled.” 
 
 
Aforementioned order has been impugned in this petition.  
3. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that impugned 
order dated 29.10.2024 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, 
Sialkot is against the law and facts therefore same is liable to be set-
aside.  
4. 
 
On the other hand, learned Deputy Prosecutor General has 
supported the impugned order. 
5. 
 
After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner, 
learned Deputy Prosecutor General for the State and going 
through available record appended with this petition, it has been 
noticed that first application for post-arrest bail filed by the petitioner in 
the case on 27.07.2024 was withdrawn without assigning any reason by 
learned counsel for the petitioner and dismissed as withdrawn vide 
order dated 01.08.2024 passed by Mr. Hidayat Ullah Shah, learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Sialkot, then on the very next day i.e. 
02.08.2024, petitioner through same learned counsel filed 2nd 
application for post-arrest bail in the same case while concealing the 
fact of dismissal of earlier application and for the said reason, second 
application was entrusted to Mr. Muhammad Irfan Basra, learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Sialkot which was accepted vide order 
dated 08.08.2024.  
 
 
Withdrawing first application and then on the very next 
day, filing another application through the same counsel while not 
mentioning dismissal of earlier application resulting into entrustment of 
2nd application to another learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sialkot, 
getting bail from there and even not disclosing earlier dismissal of 
application at the time of final arguments in 2nd application clearly 
reflects the violation of ratio as well as spirit contained in the case of 
“The STATE THROUGH  ADVOCATE-GENERAL, N.W.F.P. 
versus ZUBAIR AND 4 OTHERS”   (PLD 1986 SC 173) and its re-
visit (2002 SCMR 171) and “Nazir Ahmed and others versus The 
State and others” (PLD 2014 Supreme Court 241).  

                         Crl. Revision No.72289/2024     
 
 
 
           4 
 
 
 
Relief obtained by way of such foul play i.e. concealing 
dismissal of earlier petition cannot be permitted to remain in the field, 
therefore, irrespective of the merit of the case, impugned order has been 
passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sialkot while keeping in 
view the peculiar facts and circumstances as well as settled principles 
of law on the subject, therefore, same needs no interference by this 
Court. It goes without saying that in the case of “Farooq Hussain and 
others Versus Sheikh Aftab Ahmad and others” (PLD 2020 
Supreme Court 617), it has been clearly observed that if the Court 
having examined the decision challenged before it, is satisfied with its 
reasoning and conclusions and is of the view that it does not call for 
any interference, then Court can simply endorse the impugned decision 
and adopt the reasoning of the court below; relevant portion of the said 
order is hereby reproduced: - 
“It is emphasized that if this Court, having examined the judgment 
challenged before it, is satisfied with its reasoning and conclusions and is of 
the view that it does not call for any interference, this Court can simply 
endorse the impugned judgment and adopt the reasoning of the court below. 
In such a case, re-tracing the same path travelled by the court below 
appears to be an unnecessary exercise and a waste of public time-time which 
can be allocated to other cases where the decisions of the courts below have 
been overturned or modified. Finding no reversible error in the judgment, a 
concise, simple order can suffice. On the other hand, if the Court is to 
reverse or modify the judgment of the court below, the reasons for the 
reversal or modification must be set forth. 
3.  
This approach adopted by the court, is by no means a short-cut 
which is offensive to fair trial under Article 10-A of the Constitution nor 
does it in any manner undermine due process and fair-play. It is simply a 
creative way forward that spares the Court from writing opinions where a 
mere adoption of a well-reasoned judgment of the court below through a 
short order serves the purpose adequately.” 
 
6. 
In view of what has been discussed above, instant petition is 
without merits and is hereby dismissed in limine.
