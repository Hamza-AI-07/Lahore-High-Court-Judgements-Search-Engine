W. P. No. 48527 of 2021 
Meezan Beverages (Pvt.) Limited 
VERSUS 
Competition Commission of Pakistan and two others 
 
JUDGMENT 
Date of Hearing 
10.06.2024 
Petitioner  By: 
Mr. Adil Bandial, Advocate 
Respondents By: 
Mr. Ali Javed Darugar, Advocate 
ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J. This constitutional Petition is directed 
against the impugned notice dated 30.08.2018 (the “Notice”), show cause 
notice dated 07.07.2021 (the “SCN”) and actions taken pursuant thereto, by 
the Respondents, being unlawful, illegal and without jurisdiction.  
2. 
 
The brief facts of this case are that the Petitioner is a private 
limited company existing under the Companies Act, 2017 and is engaged in 
the business of, inter alia, manufacturing, production and sale of aerated 
waters, carbonated drinks and beverages, mineral water, juice and energy 
drinks. Amongst various products, the Petitioner also manufactures, sells 
and markets, an energy drink under the brand name of ‘Storm’. The 
Petitioner applied for registration of trademark of Storm on 11.09.2015 with 
the Intellectual Property Organization (the “IPO”) under the Intellectual 
Property Organization of Pakistan Act, 2012 (the “IPO Act”) read with the 
Trade Marks Ordinance, 2001 (the “Trade Marks Ordinance”) and the 
same was accordingly, registered in Class 32 under No. 397388 dated 
13.03.2021. 
3. 
 
The Competition Commission of Pakistan (the “CCP”) and its 
functionaries are arrayed as the Respondents who are tasked to regulate the 
competition law as encapsulated in the Competition Act, 2010 (the “Act”). 
The CCP issued the impugned Notice to the Petitioner pursuant to 

2                               W. P. No. 48527 / 2021 
 
Regulation 16(2) of the Competition Commission (General Enforcement) 
Regulations, 2007 informing the Petitioner that M/s PepsiCo, (the 
“Complainant”) has filed a complaint against the Petitioner for alleged 
violation of Chapter II and more particularly, Section 10 of the Act with 
respect to deceptive marketing practices. A copy of the complaint along with 
its annexures was attached with the impugned Notice. It was further stated 
therein that the CCP has initiated a formal inquiry under the provisions of 
Section 37(2) of the Act by appointing Inquiry Officers and the Petitioner 
was called upon to furnish its reply to the complaint on or before 
17.09.2018. 
4. 
 
The Complainant, in essence, had alleged that product of the 
Petitioner under the brand name Storm in packaging is deceptively similar 
to that of the Complainant’s product marketed under the brand name of 
“Sting”. The Petitioner’s brand is being packaged with overall look, feel, 
get-up and color scheme that is closely, deceptively and / or parasitically 
similar to the Complainant’s brand. This fact is established with pictorial 
evidence that the Petitioner imitated several well-known and renowned 
brands other than the Complainant’s which demonstrates mala fide intention 
of the Petitioner to capitalize on the reputation and goodwill of others. As 
such, the Petitioner has indulged in deceptive marketing practices in 
violation of Section 10 of the Act. 
5. 
 
 The Petitioner instead of replying to the impugned Notice vide 
letter dated 17.09.2018 requested for extension in time to file its reply which 
was granted till 15.10.2018 vide letter dated 18.09.2018. The Petitioner 
through its reply dated 12.10.2018 informed the CCP that it has assailed the 
vires of the Act coupled with proceedings initiated against it by instituting 
W.P. No. 241159 / 2018. In consequence of an injunctive Order passed 
therein, the proceedings before the CCP were suspended. However, vide 
Order dated 26.10.2020, the Writ Petition was dismissed and the injunction 
stood vacated, whereafter, the Petitioner was again directed to furnish its 
reply to the complaint vide letter dated 04.02.2021. However, the Petitioner 
informed the CCP on 15.02.2021 that it has challenged the Judgment passed 
in referred Writ Petition through CPLA No. 413-C / 2021 before the 

3                               W. P. No. 48527 / 2021 
 
Supreme Court of Pakistan which is still pending and as such, further 
proceedings be stayed. As no injunctive order was passed by the Apex 
Court, the CCP again required the Petitioner in terms of letter dated 
24.02.2021 to participate in the pending inquiry proceedings. In response 
thereto, the Petitioner eventually filed its reply dated 05.03.2021 raising, 
inter alia, objections regarding the CCP’s assumption and exercise of 
jurisdiction to initiate and conduct inquiry; and non-compliance of statutory 
pre-requisites under Section 37 of the Act.  
6. 
 
The CCP opined that the only mandate of inquiry is to 
determine whether the allegations leveled in the complaint amount to, prima 
facie, violation of Section 10(1) of the Act in general; and whether the 
Petitioner has engaged in deceptive marketing practices within the meaning 
and scope of Section 10(2)(a), (b) and (d) of the Act through the distribution 
of false or misleading information that is capable of harming business 
interest of the Complainant; or distribution of false or misleading 
information to consumers lacking a reasonable basis or through fraudulent 
use of the Complainant’s trade dress which includes product labelling or 
packaging and as such, amounts to violation of Section 10(1) of the Act. 
After conducting inquiry, it was concluded that prima facie violations under 
the Act warrant initiation of ‘proceedings’ against the Petitioner under 
Section 30 of the Act. 
7. 
 
Accordingly, the impugned SCN was issued to the Petitioner 
which specifically stipulated that pursuant to an inquiry conducted under 
Section 37(2) of the Act, the inquiry report dated 28.06.2021 appended as 
Annexure-1 and constituting an integral part thereof, reveals violations of 
Section 10(1) of the Act. Hence, the Petitioner is called upon to show cause 
within fourteen working days from the date of receipt of the SCN to appear 
and place before the CCP, facts and material in support of its contentions 
and to avail the opportunity of being heard. Nevertheless, the Petitioner, 
instituted the instant Petition. 
8. 
 
In view of the above factual context, learned counsel for the 
Petitioner contended that the CCP was legally obliged to decide the question 

4                               W. P. No. 48527 / 2021 
 
of jurisdiction in the first instance but it failed to do so. The CCP did not 
comply with the mandatory pre-requisites embodied in Section 37 of the Act 
inasmuch as, the CCP neither formulated nor conveyed a formal order to the 
effect that the complaint is not frivolous, vexatious or based on insufficient 
facts and as such, constitutes a contravention of the provisions of Chapter II 
of the Act. Relying upon Paragraph 3.7.11 of the inquiry report which states 
that the Complainant has built its case, inter alia, on trade dress, packaging, 
look, feel and get-up of products, confusing or deceptive similarity in terms 
of shape of bottle, label, design, color combination, color scheme, logo 
design, lettering, color of drink, aesthetic design elements, look alike, 
passing off, dilution, pattern, marks, resemblance and copyrights, learned 
counsel argued that the nature of allegations relates to infringement of 
trademark, therefore, the subject matter of the complaint fell within the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the Intellectual Property Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) 
established under Section 16 of the IPO Act which is empowered to 
adjudicate all alleged acts of infringement of trademarks under the IPO Act 
read with the Trade Marks Ordinance. Hence, the impugned action fell 
beyond the purview of Section 10 of the Act as it encroaches upon the 
jurisdiction and mandate of the IPO and the Tribunal vested by the IPO Act 
as a subsequent enactment. Hence, the impugned Notice issued under 
Section 37(2) of the Act and the impugned SCN under Section 30 of the Act 
are patently without jurisdiction, void ab initio and coram non judice which 
are liable to be set aside along with collateral proceedings.  
9. 
 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the CCP submitted that the 
impugned Notice was issued to the Petitioner in lawful exercise of 
jurisdiction under Section 10 of the Act and an inquiry was initiated by the 
CCP under Section 37(2) of the Act after formulating its opinion on the basis 
of evaluation of the complaint that it provided sufficient material to warrant 
an enquiry to determine whether a contravention of Chapter II of the Act 
was made out and reply from the Petitioner was sought through the 
impugned Notice. However, the Petitioner abused the process of law and 
delayed the enquiry by initiating frivolous and unnecessary litigation, 
restricting the CCP to proceed further within the mandate and scope of the 

5                               W. P. No. 48527 / 2021 
 
Act. Complete complaint was sent to the Petitioner on the basis of which the 
CCP had formed its opinion for initiating inquiry and as such, the mandate 
of Section 37 of the Act had been fully complied with. The inquiry report 
itself also endorses the view that the complaint is not frivolous or based on 
insufficient material and it has been recommended to initiate proceedings 
against the Petitioner under Section 30 of the Act by holding that acts of the 
Petitioner, prima facie appear to be in violation of Section 10 of the Act. As 
such, the pre-requisites of Section 37 of the Act were duly adhered to by the 
CCP in accordance with the test developed in case titled, “Competition 
Commission of Pakistan and others v. Dalda Foods Limited, Karachi” (2023 
SCMR 1991), wherein, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has recognized 
jurisdiction of the CCP to prevent and address anti-competitive practices. 
Accordingly, the SCN was issued to the Petitioner and an opportunity of 
hearing has been provided. All contentions and preliminary objections of the 
Petitioner including that of jurisdiction of the CCP are liable to be addressed 
during ‘proceedings’ under the SCN. However, the Petitioner with mala fide 
intention has again proceeded to challenge the SCN through the instant 
Petition. Without prejudice to the above, the CCP is duly authorized under 
Section 30 of the Act to issue a show cause notice in cases of contravention 
of Chapter II of the Act, in particular, Section 10 thereof. The CCP under the 
Act and the IPO as well as the Tribunal constituted under the IPO Act do not 
have overlapping but distinct and separate jurisdiction within the ambit of 
the Act and the IPO Act, respectively. As such, this Petition is not 
maintainable being pre-mature and having been instituted only to frustrate 
the due process of law. Therefore, this Petition is liable to be dismissed and 
the CCP should be allowed to proceed with the matter in accordance with 
law.  
10. 
 
From the rival contentions of the parties, the points of 
determination before this Court are as follows: 
(i) 
Whether the impugned Notice has been issued by the 
CCP after complying with the requirements of Section 37 
of the Act? and 

6                               W. P. No. 48527 / 2021 
 
(ii) 
Whether the jurisdiction of the CCP with respect to 
deceptive marketing practices in terms of Section 10 of 
the Act is distinct and separate from the jurisdiction 
vested in the Tribunal under the IPO Act? 
11. 
 
In order to address the first query, it is expedient to analyze the 
scheme of law encapsulated in the Act which has been promulgated to make 
provisions to ensure free competition in all spheres of commercial and 
economic activity to enhance economic efficiency, to protect consumers 
from anti-competitive behavior and to provide for the establishment of the 
CCP to maintain and enhance competition. As such, the domain, scope and 
focus of the Act is to foster competition and curb anti-competitive practices 
between competing undertakings. Section 2(q) of the Act defines 
‘undertaking’ which means any natural or legal person, governmental body 
including a regulatory authority, body corporate, partnership, association, 
trust or other entity, in any way, engaged, directly or indirectly, in the 
production, supply, distribution of goods or provision or control of services 
and shall include an association of undertakings. One component of 
competition law is deceptive marketing practices. Section 10(1) of the Act 
provides that no undertaking shall enter into deceptive marketing practices. 
Section 10(2) of the Act states that deceptive marketing practices shall be 
deemed to have been resorted to or continued, if an undertaking resorts to 
the distribution of false or misleading information that is capable of harming 
the business interests of another undertaking; the distribution of false or 
misleading information to consumers, including the distribution of 
information lacking a reasonable basis, related to the price, character, 
method or place of production, properties, suitability for use or quality of 
goods; false or misleading comparison of goods in the process of 
advertising; or fraudulent use of another’s trademark, firm name, or product 
labeling or packaging. Section 28 of the Act stipulates the functions and 
powers of the CCP to initiate ‘proceedings’ in accordance with the 
procedures of the Act and ‘make orders’ in cases of contravention of 
provisions of the Act; to conduct studies for promoting competition in all 
sectors of commercial economic activity; to conduct enquiries into the 
affairs of any undertaking as may be necessary for the purposes of the Act; 

7                               W. P. No. 48527 / 2021 
 
to give advice to undertakings asking for the same as to whether any action 
proposed to be taken by such undertakings is consistent with the provisions 
of the Act, rules or orders made thereunder; to engage in competition 
advocacy; and to take all other actions as may be necessary for carrying out 
the purposes of the Act. This Section also allows delegation of powers and 
functions of the CCP to its members or officers. Section 30(1) of the Act 
proclaims that where the CCP is satisfied that there has been or is likely to 
be, a contravention of any provision of Chapter II, it may make one or more 
of such ‘orders’ specified in Section 31 thereof, as it may deem appropriate 
and may also impose a ‘penalty’ at rates prescribed in Section 38 thereof. 
Section 30(2) of the Act imposes an obligation upon the CCP to adopt due 
process by giving notice of its intention to make such an order stating the 
reasons therefor, to such undertaking, as may appear to it, to be in 
contravention; and give the undertaking an opportunity of being heard on 
such date as may be specified in the notice and of placing before the CCP, 
facts and material in support of its contention. Section 30(5) of the Act 
requires the CCP to pass a reasoned order while Section 30(4) thereof 
provides that such an order shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any 
contract or memorandum or articles of association. 
12. 
 
Section 37 of the Act relates to enquiry and studies. Section 
37(1) thereof empowers the CCP on its own or upon a reference made to it 
by the Federal Government, to conduct enquires into any matter relevant to 
the purposes of the Act. Section 37(2) of the Act provides that where the 
CCP receives from an undertaking or a registered association of consumers, 
a complaint in writing of such facts as appear to constitute a contravention of 
the provisions of Chapter II, it shall, unless it is of opinion that the 
application is frivolous or vexatious or based on insufficient facts, or is not 
substantiated by prima facie evidence, conduct an enquiry into the matter to 
which the complaint relates. Section 37(4) of the Act states that if upon the 
conclusion of any inquiry under Sub-Section (1) and (2), the CCP is of the 
opinion that findings are such that it is necessary in the public interest so to 
do, it shall initiate ‘proceedings’ under Section 30 of the Act. Sections 41 to 
44 of the Act provide for the remedies of appeal that may be availed by an 

8                               W. P. No. 48527 / 2021 
 
aggrieved person subject to conditions enumerated therein. Section 43 of the 
Act constitutes Competition Appellate Tribunal and empowers it to hear 
appeals under Section 42 thereof against an order of the CCP comprising 
two or more members or of the Appellate Bench of the CCP. Final appeal 
against the order of the Competition Appellate Tribunal lies to the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan under Section 44 of the Act. Finally, Section 59 confers 
overriding effect to the provisions of the Act, notwithstanding anything 
contained in any other law for the time being in force. 
13. 
 
Therefore, it is manifestly clear that the Act provides for a self-
contained regulatory regime to regulate and enforce the scheme of law. The 
‘proceedings’ in cases of contravention can only be initiated under Section 
30 of the Act and based upon an order passed thereunder, the CCP may also 
impose a penalty at rates prescribed in Section 38 of the Act in all cases of 
contravention of the provisions of Chapter II. The powers of the CCP to 
conduct studies or inquiries or to give advice or to engage in competition 
advocacy do not involve any penal consequences and are merely tools 
available to the CCP to gather information to administer various provisions 
of the Act. Under Section 37(2) of the Act, when an aggrieved person 
triggers the powers of the CCP to hold an inquiry against a specified 
undertaking on a set of allegations contained in the complaint, the CCP is 
obliged to act accordingly unless it is of opinion that the application is 
frivolous or vexatious or based on insufficient facts, or is not substantiated 
by prima facie evidence. As such, the internal decision-making process 
regarding veracity of the complaint or a written opinion thereon need not be 
shared but the notice communicating gist of reasons or nature of alleged 
violations justifying the inquiry accompanied with the complaint itself 
constitutes sufficient compliance of the requirements of Section 37(2) of the 
Act.  
14. 
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in Dalda Foods case (supra) 
authoritatively addressed the questions regarding mandate of Section 37 of 
the Act with reference to the powers of the CCP for conducting an inquiry. It 
was held that ‘enquiry’ and ‘studies’ are independent tools employed by the 
CCP to collect and assess information on market trends and do not constitute 
an adverse action or ‘proceeding’ under Section 30 of the Act against the 

9                               W. P. No. 48527 / 2021 
 
undertaking.  As such, Section 37 of the Act does not in itself result in penal 
consequences. Addressing the requirements of Section 37 of the Act, it was 
opined that the CCP is obliged to communicate the gist of reasons to the 
undertaking if it decides to proceed against the undertaking as recorded in its 
internal deliberations which led to the decision of initiating such an inquiry. 
This is a minimum requirement for the purposes of transparency and good 
governance and also facilitates the regulatory process by keeping the 
undertaking informed. The result of an inquiry may lead to enunciation of 
formal ‘proceedings’ under Section 30 of the Act which requires issuance of 
notice, communication of detailed reasons and right of hearing. 
15. 
 
In the instant case, gist of the reasons or nature of allegations 
i.e. ‘deceptive marketing practices’ constituting violation of Section 10 of 
the Act was stated in the body of the impugned Notice under Section 37(2) 
of the Act and the complete complaint of the Complainant along with its 
annexures was appended therewith, the contents whereof, surely constituted 
and conveyed all the reasons on the basis of which the CCP considered it 
expedient to conduct an enquiry as the latter did not found it frivolous or 
vexatious or based on insufficient facts, or not substantiated by prima facie 
evidence. As such, the test developed in Dalda Foods case (supra) in terms 
of requirements of Section 37 of the Act was fully met. Moreover, in the 
impugned SCN, detailed reasons were incorporated and right of reply 
coupled with hearing was duly accorded. Hence, there is no procedural 
infirmity or irregularity regarding issuance of impugned Notice and SCN on 
part of the CCP.  
16. 
 
The second query pertains to exclusion of jurisdiction of the 
CCP under the Act vis-à-vis the Tribunal created under Section 16 of the 
IPO Act with respect to the nature of allegations levelled against the 
Petitioner in the impugned Notice and SCN. In order to address the query, it 
will be beneficial to examine the IPO Act which was promulgated in the 
year 2012 with the primary objective to establish the IPO for protection of 
various intellectual property rights of the citizens to foster creative thinking, 
stimulate creativity, provide incentives for technological innovations and 
attract investments. The existing institutional arrangements under various 
intellectual property laws were consolidated under the umbrella of the IPO 

10                               W. P. No. 48527 / 2021 
 
to achieve exclusivity and integration regarding all subjects and matters 
relating to intellectual property rights. Section 2(h) of the IPO Act defines 
intellectual property laws as the laws specified in its Schedule which 
includes the Trade Marks Ordinance. The IPO was established under 
Section 3 of the IPO Act and the policy board was setup under Section 4 
thereof. Section 16 thereof provides for the establishment of the Tribunal(s) 
to exercise jurisdiction under the IPO Act. Section 17(4) of the IPO Act 
provides that subject to Sub-Section (5) thereof, no Court other than a 
Tribunal shall have or exercise any jurisdiction with respect to any matter to 
which jurisdiction of the Tribunal extends under the IPO Act. Sub-Section 
(5) thereof further provides that nothing in Sub-Section (4) shall be deemed 
to affect any proceedings pending before such Court immediately before the 
coming into force of the IPO Act. Sub-Section (6) thereof states that all suits 
and proceedings pending in any Court instituted under intellectual property 
laws shall stand transferred to, and be heard and disposed of by, the 
Tribunal(s) having jurisdiction under the IPO Act. Section 18(1) of the IPO 
Act importantly proclaims that all suits and other civil proceedings 
regarding ‘infringement of intellectual property laws’ shall be instituted and 
tried in the Tribunal, whereas, Sub-Section (2) of Section 18 starts with the 
non-obstante clause and provides that notwithstanding anything contained in 
any other law for the time being in force, the Tribunal shall have exclusive 
jurisdiction to try any offence under intellectual property laws. Section 19 
relates to appeals and grants right to any person aggrieved from the final 
judgment or order of the Tribunal to prefer an appeal to the High Court 
having territorial jurisdiction over the Tribunal. Under Section 36 of the IPO 
Act, the Trade Marks Registry, Copyright Office and Patent Office were 
integrated and made part of the IPO, notwithstanding anything contained in 
any other law for the time being in force and upon commencement of the 
IPO Act. Section 39 thereof unequivocally stipulates that provisions of the 
IPO Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith 
contained in any other law for the time being in force.  
17. 
 
Therefore, it is vividly evident that purpose of the IPO Act is to 
consolidate the regulation of all existing intellectual property laws included 
in its Schedule by the IPO and vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Tribunal to 

11                               W. P. No. 48527 / 2021 
 
try all offences and adjudicate all suits and other civil proceedings regarding 
infringement or breach of intellectual property laws. 
18. 
 
Putting the Act in juxtaposition to the IPO Act, a simple and 
straight forward conclusion is evident that both the enactments have 
conspicuously distinct purpose, scope, and mandate. The Act relates to 
competition law, whereas, the IPO Act pertains to intellectual property laws. 
Each enactment has created a specialized regulatory body and has put in 
place a self-contained regulatory framework to administer duties and 
obligations imposed by law. The IPO Act consciously excludes the Act from 
its Schedule and as such, the legislature has intentionally kept the Act 
beyond the purview of the IPO Act. Hence, ‘deceptive marketing practices’ 
under Section 10 of the Act constitute a necessary and essential element of 
competition law, jurisdiction of which is vested with the CCP under the Act. 
It is invoked and employed in the context of enforcement of competition law 
and the same has no relation, nexus or connection with breach or 
infringement of intellectual property rights under the intellectual property 
laws included in the Schedule of the IPO Act which have their own 
dimensions, contours and consequences being subject of jurisdiction of the 
Tribunal under the IPO Act. As such, violations of Section 10 of the Act in 
terms of ‘deceptive marketing practices’ under the Act has different 
ingredients than ‘infringement of intellectual property rights’ under the 
‘intellectual property laws’, although an impugned action may entail 
concurrent proceedings within the distinct scope, mandate and ambit of the 
Act and the IPO Act. The distinction becomes more vivid as there is no 
requirement of ‘breach of intellectual property rights’ under the ‘intellectual 
property laws’ including the Trade Marks Ordinance to invoke and trigger 
the jurisdiction of the CCP under the Act in terms of ‘deceptive marketing 
practices’. The consequences and penalties for ‘deceptive marketing 
practices’ under provisions of the Act are contrastingly different from the 
‘infringement of intellectual property laws’ under the IPO Act. This 
conclusion is manifestly evident from the express exclusion of the Act from 
the Schedule of the IPO Act. Hence, the argument that exclusive jurisdiction 
of the Tribunal to adjudicate claims of infringement of intellectual property 
laws and offences under the IPO Act being a subsequent enactment 

12                               W. P. No. 48527 / 2021 
 
impliedly excludes jurisdiction of the CCP in terms of deceptive marketing 
practices under Section 10 of the Act is completely misconceived since 
jurisdiction of the CCP under the Act and the IPO or the Tribunal under the 
IPO Act are distinct and separate in terms of ambit and scope of such laws 
and does not amount to any inconsistency or conflict of jurisdiction. 
Therefore, the objection that the impugned SCN has been issued by the CCP 
without jurisdiction is discarded, accordingly.  
19. 
 
It is now well entrenched in our jurisprudence that the 
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court as a normal rule cannot be invoked 
on mere suspicion or apprehension when no substantive right is infringed 
and the aggrieved party has the right to advance its defense in response to a 
notice. The challenge to a show cause notice in writ jurisdiction at premature 
stage and tendency to bypass the remedy provided under the concerned 
statute amount to fetter the rights conferred on statutory functionaries 
specially constituted for the purpose to initially decide the matter. The 
objections of the Petitioner would have been decided by the CCP during 
proceedings under the SCN but such an occasion did not arise due to the 
filing of the instant Petition. As such, the Petitioner did not approach this 
Court with clean hands and resorted to uncalled for litigation, thereby, 
obstructing the CCP as regulator empowered under the law to undertake and 
perform its routine functions and duties. Reliance is placed on case titled, 
“Commissioner Inland Revenue and others v. Jahangir Khan Tareen and 
others” (2022 SCMR 92). Therefore, the titled Petition was not maintainable 
on this score as well.    
20. 
 
In view of the foregoing reasons, this constitutional Petition is 
devoid of merit and the same is dismissed.
