ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. Through this constitutional 
petition, the petitioner has challenged his transfer order dated 
05.03.2022 (impugned order), whereby in compliance of the 
direction of the Ministry of Industries and Production, Government 
of Pakistan (Ministry) letters dated 17.02.2022 and 04.03.2022, 
the petitioner has been transferred from the post of Deputy Director 
(Marketing) BPS-18 Lahore to PITAC Regional Centre (R.C.), 
Quetta and posted as Regional Manager/Incharge R.C., with 
immediate effect. 
2. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the 
petitioner is not a civil servant but is employee of Pakistan 
Industrial Technical Assistance (PITAC) and posted as Deputy 
Director (Marketing) PITAC Lahore. Submits that for political 

W.P. No.15304/2024

reasons, the petitioner on the direction of the Ministry has been 
transferred from Lahore to Quetta. Submits that under the relevant 
rules the Competent Authority to transfer Grade-18 and above 
officers in PITAC is with the Executive Committee of PITAC and 
Ministry has no role in the matter, therefore, the impugned order is 
not sustainable. In response to question of maintainability of this 
petition, he submits that PITAC was attached Organization of 
Ministry but subsequently registered under the Societies 
Registration Act, 1860 (Act) and its rules and regulations, 1962 as 
revised in 2014 were framed by the Federal Government, therefore, 
the said Rules being statutory, this constitutional petition is 
maintainable. 
3. 
 
Learned counsel for respondents No.3 to 5 as well as 
learned Law Officer on behalf of remaining respondents, on the 
other hand, supported the impugned order and submits that the 
concerned Ministry is the Competent Authority to transfer the 
petitioner for cogent reasons as PITAC is under the administrative 
control of the concerned Ministry. 
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. Before touching merits of 
the case, I would like to decide question of maintainability of this 
petition against PITAC. With a view to increase the productivity of 
industrial units in the Country and to introduce improved 
productive techniques and to provide an organized and nationwide 
programme for training managerial and technical personnel the 
“PITAC” which was an attached Organization of the Ministry of 

W.P. No.15304/2024

Industries, was converted into an autonomous agency and 
registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 with 
Headquarters at Lahore vide Ministry of Industries Resolution 
dated 26.05.1962. The Central Government made Rules and 
Regulations, 1962 of PITAC which were notified on 26.05.1962 
(Rules and Regulations). Subsequently with approval by the 
Government of Pakistan, Recruitment and Promotion Rules, 2014 
were promulgated to revise the Rules and Regulations of 1962. 
From above facts, it is manifest that PITAC is a Government 
owned and controlled entity and its Rules, Regulations and bye-
laws, being also framed by the Central Government/Federal 
Government, have statutory status. In view of above, this 
constitutional petition for enforcement of aforesaid Rules and 
Regulations, against PITAC is maintainable. In this regard, 
reliance is placed on Bashir Ahmad etc vs. The Director General, 
LDA etc (2020 SCMR 471), Shafique Ahmed Khan etc vs. Nescom 
through Chairman Islamabad etc (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 
377), Zarai Taraqiati Bank etc vs. Said Rehman etc (2013 SCMR 
642), Pakistan Defence Officers’ Housing Authority etc vs. Lt. Col. 
Syed Jawaid Ahmed (2013 SCMR 1707) and Bashir Ali Shahzad 
vs. Bank of Punjab etc (2023 PLC (C.S.) 1059). This legal position 
is also not disputed by the respondents No.3 to 5 in Para “a” of 
their report and parawise comments

On merits, Appendix-1 issued under Clause 59 of the Rules 
and Regulations (as amended in 2014) ibid prescribed the nature of

power and Competent Authority to exercise the said power. 
Column-4 of Appendix-1 relates to the posting and transfer of the 
officers of PITAC. For convenience, Column-4 Appendix-1 of the

6. 
 
From above Column-4 of Appendix-I read with 
Clause 59 of the Rules and Regulations, it is evident that the power 
to transfer BPS-18 to BPS-19 Technical and Non-Technical 
officers of PITAC, is with the Executive Committee of PITAC and 
the Ministry has no jurisdiction to transfer Grade-18 officers of 
PITAC or to direct Assistant Director (Admn.) to transfer BS-18 
officers as happened in the present case.  
7. 
 
In view of above discussion, the impugned transfer 
order dated 05.03.2022 passed in compliance with the direction of 
the Ministry, vide its letters dated 17.02.2022 and 04.03.2022, is 
patently without jurisdiction, hence is not sustainable. Though 
there are allegations and counter allegations by respective parties 
in this Petition and in response thereto, however, as the impugned 
order is found to be without jurisdiction, therefore, without 

W.P. No.15304/2024

discussing any other ground, this constitutional petition is allowed 
on this sole ground. Consequently the impugned transfer order 
dated 05.03.2022 is set aside being without lawful authority and of 
no legal effect. However, this order will not preclude the 
Competent Authority to pass appropriate order in respect of the 
petitioner in accordance with the relevant Rules and Regulations.
