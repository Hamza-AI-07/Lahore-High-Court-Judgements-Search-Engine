JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MUHAMMAD RAZA QURESHI, J. Since the instant Appeal as 
well as connected Civil Revision bearing No.12886/2022 emanate 
from proceedings which remained pending determination before the 
learned Trial Court and the Appellate Court and call into question 
the same Order dated 03.12.2021, therefore, the instant Appeal as 
well as connected Civil Revision are decided together. As the facts 
relating to the controversy are admitted, therefore, for the purposes 
of convenience, the facts and grounds agitated in the instant Appeal 
are referred and determined.  
2. 
The instant Appeal under Section 104 read with Order 
XLIII rule 1(u) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the “CPC”) 
calls into question the legality, validity and propriety of Order dated 
03.12.2021 passed by the Appellate Court pursuant whereto the 
Order dated 21.05.2021 passed by the Trial Court rejecting the 
Date of Hearing 
04.05.2023

C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
plaint in a suit filed by Bashir  Ahmed Tahir (“Respondent No.1”) 
was set aside and the matter was remanded to the Trial Court with a 
direction to frame issue on the maintainability of the subject matter 
suit and proceed in accordance with law. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the Appellant submits that the 
Impugned Order is not sustainable in the eyes of law as it suffers 
from serious jurisdictional defects. According to learned counsel, 
the suit filed by the Respondent No.1 was not only barred by law in 
terms of Order VII rule 11 (d) of the CPC but  plaint also failed to 
disclose a cause of action against the Appellant impleaded in the 
suit as Defendant No.2, therefore, the plaint was liable to be 
rejected in terms of Order VII rule 11 (a) of the CPC. Contends that 
the Appellate Court erred in law by remanding the matter to the 
Trial Court with a direction to frame issue with respect to 
maintainability of the suit. According to learned counsel, the 
Appellate Court had ample powers under Order XLI rule 33 of the 
CPC to adjudicate upon the controversy as there was no factual 
controversy to be resolved. Adds that the Appellate Court failed to 
appreciate that suit for rendition of accounts was not maintainable 
as the Respondent No.1 was not even a member/shareholder of the 
Company. Submits that had the mandate of law been followed, the 
legal consequence thereof was that Appeal filed by the Respondent 
No.1 was liable to be dismissed by accepting the cross objections 
filed by the Appellant.

4. 
Learned 
counsel 
for 
Wincom 
(Pvt.) 
Ltd. 
(“Wincom”)/Respondent No.2 impleaded in the suit as Defendant 
No.1 has supported the contentions of learned counsel for the 
Appellant and submits that Wincom being owner of subject matter 
property supports its transfer in favour of the Appellant and the 
Respondent No.1 being not a member/shareholder of Wincom had 
no locus standi to question the transaction inter se Wincom and the 
Appellant. 
5. 
Conversely, 
learned 
counsel 
representing 
the 
Respondent No.1 while supporting the Impugned Order passed by 
the learned Appellate Court submits that the same has been passed 
in lawful exercise of jurisdiction. Contends that this Court has very 
limited jurisdiction to interfere in a remand order as the issues of 
law as well as facts with respect to jurisdiction and maintainability 
were directed to be decided by the learned Trial Court. According 
to learned counsel, the instant Appeal merits dismissal and the 
Impugned Order is liable to be upheld by this Court. 
6. 
The arguments of learned counsel for the parties have 
been heard and record has been perused with their able assistance.  
7. 
The proceedings culminating into the Impugned Order 
has its genesis in a suit for declaration, rendition of accounts, 
cancellation of documents, recovery and injunction, inter alia, 
against Wincom and the Appellant seeking following reliefs: 
      “i. Restraining Defendant No. 2 from selling the Suit 
Property to any third party, until full and final 
settlement and recovery of the share proceeds of the 

-4- 
F.A.O.No.81002 of 2021 
C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
Plaintiff including but not limited to his investment in 
the Company. 
ii.  Directing the Defendants, No. 1, 3 and 4 to render   
complete accounts of the Company, including 
documentation supporting (1) transfer of the 
Plaintiff's/company’s assets/shares/capital/ dividends 
and write-offs if any. (i) alleged board resolution and 
partners authorization given to Defendant No. 1, 3 
and 4 to sell the Suit Property to Defendant No. 2. 
iii.  Declaring that (i) the Suit Property has been illegally 
transferred to Defendant No. 2, without payment of 
any consideration to the Plaintiff company (ii) the 
resolution passed by directors of the Company 
(Wincom (Private) Limited) has been forged, in the 
absence of partners authorization in violation of the 
Contract of Establishment signed between the 
partners in 2006 (iii) the sale of Property to 
Defendant 
No. 
2 
was 
undertaken 
without 
authorization, 
illegal, 
unlawful 
and 
without 
jurisdiction hence void ab-initio, therefore sale deed 
to this effect be cancelled and declared as null and 
void. 
iv. Direction may also be passed for taking punitive 
action against the culprits for making fraudulent 
transaction. It is further prayed that a decree may 
please be passed for cancellation of all forged 
documents, including the sale deed dated 9th 
February 2017 and any instruments perpetuating 
transfer of share/assets/capital/wright-offs (if any) of 
the company resulting in the Plaintiff's loss.” 
8.                The contents of plaint and reliefs prayed therein 
reflect that the Respondent No.1 claimed that in year 2006, the 
Company with the name of Wincom Services Pakistan LLC (the 
“Wincom LLC”) was incorporated in United Arab Emirates. The 
said Company was governed by its charter, namely, Contract of 
Establishment. The Respondent No.5 Pervaiz Ahmed Shahid 
(impleaded in the suit as Defendant No.5) and one resident of 
United Arab Emirates were promotors of Wincom LLC. The 
Defendant No.5 on 01.06.2006 got incorporated Wincom which 
was, inter alia, engaged in the business of manufacturing and 

-5- 
F.A.O.No.81002 of 2021 
C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
installation of towers and laying underground wiring. On 
20.09.2008 Wincom through registered Sale Deed bearing No.3080 
purchased the subject matter property bearing Plot No.14, H-Block, 
Gulberg II, admeasuring 06 Kanals 09 Marlas 85 sqf. As per 
paragraphs No.5 & 6 of the plaint, in year 2008 Pervaiz Ahmed 
Shahid transferred his shareholding in Wincom in the name of 
Wincom LLC, who became holding Company having 99.9971% of 
shareholding of Wincom. The Respondent No.1 who claimed to be 
shareholder of Wincom LLC to the extent of 10% shares claimed 
that he owned all the assets of Wincom in addition to the assets and 
liabilities of Wincom LLC to the extent of his shareholding.  
9. 
According to the contents of plaint, the Respondent 
No.2 through its Board Resolution dated 22.12.2016 transferred its 
subject matter property in the name of the Appellant. Consequently, 
the Respondent No.1 through his suit challenged the Board 
Resolution dated 22.12.2016 passed by the Wincom through which 
the subject matter property was transferred in the name of the 
Appellant and sought restraining order against the Appellant from 
creating third party’s interest in the suit property. The Respondent 
No.1 through his suit also sought rendition of accounts from the 
Wincom and lastly sought cancellation of the Sale Deed of the 
subject matter property in favour of the Appellant, the transfer 
whereof was made on the strength of Board Resolution of Wincom. 
10. 
The suit was contested by the Appellant as well as 
other Respondents who filed their contesting written statements and 

-6- 
F.A.O.No.81002 of 2021 
C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
the Trial Court through Order dated 21.05.2021 declared that the 
suit was incompetent and jurisdiction of the learned Civil Court was 
barred in terms of Section 5 of the Companies Act, 2017. 
Consequently, the plaint in the suit was rejected under Order VII 
rule 11(d) of the CPC.  
11. 
Against the Order passed by the Trial Court, the 
Respondent No.1 filed an Appeal whereas the Appellant 
simultaneously filed cross objections seeking rejection of plaint on 
the ground that plaint had failed to disclose the cause of action 
against the contesting Respondents. The Appellate Court through 
the Impugned Order allowed the Appeal filed by the Respondent 
No.1 and remanded the matter to the Trial Court with the direction 
to frame an issue on the maintainability of the suit and decide the 
matter in accordance with law. 
12. 
To encapsulate the above narrated facts emanating 
from the plaint, it is an admitted position that the Respondent No.1 
is not shareholder of Wincom. The Wincom LLC is holding 
Company of Wincom having 99.9971% shareholding. The subject 
matter property was transferred in the name of the Appellant 
through Board Resolution dated 22.12.2016 by the Wincom and 
through his suit the Respondent No.1 sought cancellation of Sale 
Deed of Wincom in favour of the Appellant which transaction had 
its roots in the said Board Resolution.  
13. 
For determination of pivotal questions necessitating 
resolution of controversy, inter se, parties, it is imperative to 

-7- 
F.A.O.No.81002 of 2021 
C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
evaluate, firstly, whether the suit was maintainable by a non-
member against a Company challenging a Board Resolution dated 
22.12.2016 transferring its property in favour of a third person, 
secondly, whether the suit filed by the Respondent No.1 for 
rendition of accounts against Wincom was maintainable and thirdly, 
whether the Respondent No.1 had entitlement to seek a relief of 
cancellation of the Sale Deed in favour of the Appellant with 
respect to subject matter property. The answers to these questions 
would assist in adjudicating whether the Appellate Court was 
justified in remanding the matter to the Trial Court after framing of 
issue. 
14. 
The reliefs prayed for by the Respondent No.1 in his 
suit were on the strength of his purported shareholding in Wincom 
LLC, who is a holding Company of Wincom having 99.9971% 
shareholding. The Respondent No.1 in paragraph No.1 of his suit 
conceded that Wincom LLC was governed by its charter contained 
in Contract of Establishment. The said Contract of Establishment 
bears clause 11.4 pursuant whereto “the Chairman shall be solely 
entitled to appoint, add and remove the members of Board of 
Directors from time to time by written notice to the Member of 
Directors and the relevant Directors without the need to amend the 
Contract of Establishment”. Pursuant to a notice/Resolution dated 
31.01.2012 the Chairman of Wincom LLC invoked clause 11.5 and 
removed the Respondent No.1 and Pervaiz Ahmed Shahid w.e.f. 
31.01.2011 from the Board of Directors of Wincom LLC. This fact 

-8- 
F.A.O.No.81002 of 2021 
C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
has not been disputed by the Respondent No.1. According to 
learned counsel for the Respondent No.1 while determining the fate 
of the suit on the touchstone of provisions of Order VII rule 11 of 
the CPC, the Court can only look at the plaint and its contents and 
no other material can be referred or relied upon by the Court. I am 
afraid the objection raised by the Respondent No.1 is meritless in 
view of the High Court Amendment notified on 22.08.2018 
substituting the provisions of Order VII rule 11 (d) of the CPC from 
“whether the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be 
barred by law” to “whether the suit appears from the record 
available with the Court to be barred by any law.” 
15. 
The afore-noted amendment has equipped the Court to 
seek assistance from the available record, while determining the 
fate of the suit under Order VII rule 11 of the CPC. Even otherwise 
the Court, besides the averments made in the plaint and other 
material on record which on its own strength is legally sufficient to 
completely refute the claim of the Plaintiff, can also look into for 
the purposes of rejection of the plaint. It does not necessarily mean 
that the other material shall be taken as conclusive proof of the facts 
stated therein, but it actually moderates that other material on its 
own intrinsic value to be considered along with averments made in 
the plaint. Reliance in this regard is placed on the judgment 
reported as “S.M. Sham Ahmad Zaidi though Legal Heirs vs. Malik 
Hassan Ali Khan (Moin) through Legal Heirs (2002 SCMR 338). 
Even otherwise, if the Respondent No.1 has any cause of action 

-9- 
F.A.O.No.81002 of 2021 
C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
against 
the 
Board 
Resolution 
issued 
under 
Contract 
of 
Establishment, that has to be agitated before the court of competent 
jurisdiction in United Arab Emirates and the Respondent No.1 
cannot contend before this Court that said Resolution is illegal and 
unlawful. Most interestingly, the resolution dated 22.12.2016 
passed by the Board of Wincom has never been questioned by 
Wincom LLC before any fora. The said Resolution has been 
acknowledged and supported by Wincom before this Court. The 
Respondent No.1 who is not even a member/shareholder of 
Wincom does not have legal capacity, entitlement and/or locus 
standi to question the validity and legality of Board Resolution 
dated 22.12.2016. The only authority to question the said Board 
Resolution vests with the members or Directors of Wincom. 
16. 
Even if the Respondent No.1 would have been 
member of Wincom, his remedy to challenge the subject matter 
Board Resolution dated 22.12.2016 was not before the learned Civil 
Court as the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit as 
the incorporated entities and all matters pertaining thereto are tried 
and adjudicated upon under the provisions of special law i.e. the 
Companies Act, 2017. The only remedy available to the 
Respondent No.1 was to file a Petition under Section 136 of the 
Companies Act, 2017, that too on the strength of passing the 
threshold test i.e. having 10% shareholding. As per the mandate of 
law, the said Petition was to be filed within a period of thirty days 
before the Court having jurisdiction i.e. the High Court under 

-10- 
F.A.O.No.81002 of 2021 
C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
Section 5 of the Companies Act, 2017, which provides that the 
Court having jurisdiction under the Act shall be the High Court. 
Under sub-section 2 of Section 5 of the said Act, there is a bar 
against jurisdiction of the Civil Court which provides that 
“notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, no Civil 
Court as provided in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 or any 
other Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or 
proceedings in respect of any matter which the Court is empowered 
to determine by or under this Act.” Under Section 4 of the 
Companies Act, 2017, it being special statute, has overriding effect. 
The Section 5 of the said Act expressly bars the jurisdiction of Civil 
Court in the matters falling within the purview of the Companies 
Act, 2017 and the word ‘shall’ has been used in the Act, which 
makes it mandatory, especially, when there appears to be no mala 
fide or ill-will of the Court. The Companies Act, 2017 being a 
special law in such circumstances is to override the provisions of 
general law to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between 
the two. The reliance in this regard is place upon the judgment 
reported as “State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan through 
Chairman and others vs. Mst. Sardar Begum and others (2017 
CLD 1080). Therefore, any remedy to question the validity of 
meeting or Board Resolution lies before the High Court and in this 
respect the jurisdiction of Civil Court is barred.  
17. 
The challenge through the suit filed by the 
Respondent No.1 is otherwise inherently flawed against the transfer 

-11- 
F.A.O.No.81002 of 2021 
C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
of property of the Company i.e. Wincom in favour of the Appellant. 
A company is a separate entity distinct from its directors or 
shareholder and no shareholder or director of a company can be 
said to be the owner of any particular piece of a property in which 
such company has an interest. Such distinction has to be clearly 
observed between the company as a legal entity and its rights on 
one hand and individual shareholders and their rights on the other 
hand. Therefore, even if the Respondent No.1 claims to be a 
shareholder of Wincom LLC, he had no entitlement to question the 
transfer of its assets by Wincom to any third person. The said 
transfer of property in which Company has an interest can only be 
questioned by the Company or its Board. Reliance in this regard is 
placed on the judgments reports as Rai Bahadur Mohan Singh 
Oberot vs. Rai Bahadur Jodha Mal Kuthalia,etc. (PLD 1961 SC 6) 
and Anjum Rashid and others vs. Shehzad and others and others  
(2007 CLD 1210). Therefore, the  plaint actually failed to disclose 
a cause of action against the Company as well as the Appellant to 
maintain the suit. 
18. 
Now adverting to the prayer with respect to seeking 
rendition of accounts from Wincom, it must be borne in mind that 
the suit for rendition of accounts does not lie merely because that 
some accounts are maintained somewhere.  Such suit lies only 
when one party is accountable to the other in some fiduciary 
capacity, e.g. as in the case of trustee and beneficiary, principal and 
agent, guardian and ward, person entrusted with control over some 

-12- 
F.A.O.No.81002 of 2021 
C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
property for benefit of the other, etc. Therefore, for the purpose of 
seeking rendition of accounts, it is essential that the defendant must 
be an ‘accounting party’ and on account of their legal relationship, 
the defendant is obliged to render the accounts. The Respondent 
No.1 who is not even the member/shareholder of Wincom cannot 
assert even any relationship and from the entire facts mentioned in 
the plaint, the Respondent No.1 had failed to show that Wincom 
was in any way accountable to him. Reliance in this regard is 
placed on the judgments reported as Messrs Friend Engineering 
Corporation, The Mall, Lahore vs. Government of Punjab and 4 
others (1991 SCMR 2324), M. Khurram Muggo vs. Mst. Perveen 
Hameed Muggo and 3 others (PLD 2007 Lahore 518), Abdul 
Karim vs. Iqbl-ur-Rehman and 5 others (1980 CLC 1283), 
Muhammad Azam Khan vs. Askari Leasing Limited through Branch 
Manager (2014 CLD 462) and Messrs Irfan Industries (Pvt.) 
Limited through Chief Executive vs. Standard Chartered Bank 
through Chief Executive Officer and another  (2017 CLD 223). 
19. 
Since it has been held above that the Respondent No.1 
was neither a member/shareholder of Wincom nor had capacity or 
competence to question the transfer of interests in the property of 
the Company, therefore, in terms of Section 42 of the Specific 
Relief Act, 1877, he also lacked his entitlement to any legal 
character arising out of the law to seek declaration or cancellation 
of the subject matter property, which was only within the 
competence and powers of Wincom LLC or Wincom to question 

-13- 
F.A.O.No.81002 of 2021 
C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
the legality and validity of the subject matter transaction in favour 
of the Appellant. 
20. 
Now adverting to the Impugned Order passed by the 
learned Appellate Court, I think that the learned Appellate Court 
despite having clear position of law with respect to maintainability 
of suit and powers contained therein granted an undue premium to 
the Respondent No.1 by directing the Trial Court to frame an issue 
on the maintainability of the suit. It is floating on surface that plaint 
was not only barred by law but it also failed to disclose a cause of 
action. Obviously the Respondent No.1 could not have proved his 
case beyond the scope of his pleadings. Therefore, even if the 
averments or bundle of facts made in the plaint are accepted in their 
mode and form, the same do not entitle the Respondent No.1 to 
relief prayed for and for such reason too the provisions of Order VII 
rule 11 of the CPC could be invoked as there was no room for any 
other possible approach to the case. Moreover, as no triable issue 
was made out in the case, therefore, the suit was clearly hit by 
mandatory provisions of law. For the purposes of determination 
whether the plaint discloses a cause of action or not, Court has to 
presume that every averment made in the plaint is true, therefore, 
power to reject the plaint under Order VII rule 11 of the CPC must 
be exercised only if the Court comes to the conclusion that even if 
all the allegations are proved, the plaintiff would still not be entitled 
to any relief whatsoever. Reliance in this regard is placed upon the 

-14- 
F.A.O.No.81002 of 2021 
C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
judgment reported as Abdul Waheed vs. Mst. Ramzanu and others 
(2006 SCMR 489). 
21. 
The learned Appellate Court committed material 
irregularity by remanding the matter to the learned Trial Court for 
framing of issue with respect to maintainability of the suit. Whereas 
in terms of law continuing with such suit would be a futile exercise 
and it is clearly established that the suit filed by the Respondent 
No.1 was with manifest purposes and oblique object, to retain or 
claim the benefit of such gain which the Respondent No.1 was not 
entitled to and it was aimed to simply cause prejudice and 
harassment to the Appellant as well as other contesting defendants. 
The reliance in this regard is placed upon the judgment reported as 
M. Khurram Muggo vs. Mst. Perveen Hameed Muggo and 3 others 
(PLD 2007 Lahore 518).  
22. 
Pursuant to law laid down by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the judgment reported as Haji Abdul Karim and others 
vs. Messrs Florida Builders (Pvt.) Limited (PLD 2012 SC 247), if it 
“appears” to the Court from the statements in the plaint that suit 
was barred then it should be terminated forthwith. The great 
advantage of this would be twofold: on the one hand, firstly, the 
defendant would be saved from the harassment of being subjected 
to a prolonged and costly trial proceedings including the leading of 
evidence, which could be extended over a considerable period of 
time; secondly, a great deal of valuable Court time would also be 
saved from being wasted. “The second consideration is of special 

-15- 
F.A.O.No.81002 of 2021 
C.R.No.12886/2022 
 
 
importance considering the extent to which the Courts are at 
present clogged within an enormous amount of cases. Thus, the 
idea, in brief, would be to bury the suit at its inception. Therefore, it 
appears to be the rationale for the use of word ‘appear’ as against 
more strong words ‘established’ or ‘proved’. 
23. 
After examining the position of law, this Court is 
convinced that the Impugned Order passed by the learned Appellate 
Court is not sustainable and it is held that the suit filed by the 
Respondent No.1 with respect to prayers No.(ii) and (iii), was 
barred by law, whereas, with respect to prayers No.(i) and (iv), the 
plaint miserably failed to disclose a cause of action. Therefore, it 
was liable to be rejected in terms of Order VII rule 11 (a) and (d) of 
the CPC.  
24. 
As a consequence of the above stated position of law, 
the Impugned Order passed by the learned Appellate Court is 
declared to be illegal, unlawful and having been passed in illegal 
exercise of jurisdiction and is set aside and the instant Appeal as 
well as connected Civil Revision No.12886 of 2022 are allowed.
