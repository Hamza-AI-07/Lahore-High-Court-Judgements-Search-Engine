This is second petition U/S 497 Cr.P.C., whereby, 
the petitioner seeks his post arrest bail in case FIR 
No.177/23 dated 26.01.2023, in respect of an offence 
U/S 489-F PPC, registered at Police Station, Defence-
B, 
District 
Lahore. 
The 
first 
one 
bearing 
Crl.Misc.No.15118-B/2023 was opted to be withdrawn 
by the petitioner vide order dated 28.03.2023.  
2. 
On the last date of hearing i.e. 11.05.2023, Malik 
Imran Khan Thaheem, learned counsel for the petitioner 
while referring to an order dated 14.03.2023 of another 
Bench of this Court, whereby, post arrest bail was 
granted to the petitioner in some other case, requested 
for transfer of this case to said Bench, however, he was 
reminded that since the first bail application of the 
petitioner in this FIR had been dealt with by this Bench, 
therefore, keeping in view the dictum laid down by the 
Apex Court in famous Zubair’s case (PLD 1986 SC 
173), this matter cannot be transferred to anyother 
Bench, upon which learned counsel partially addressed 
the arguments and thereafter made a request for 
adjournment to seek instructions from his client, which 

Crl.Misc.No.27751-B/2023                                                                     2 
 
was accordingly granted and the matter was adjourned 
for today.  
3. 
In the intervening period, Mr. Bilal Ahmed Sheikh, 
Advocate, who was blocked by this Bench due to his 
unprofessional conduct, filed power of attorney on 
behalf of the petitioner in the office, however, the office 
keeping in view dictum in Zubair’s Case, fixed the 
matter before this Bench. Mr. Bilal Ahmad Sheikh, 
Advocate, while appearing on the rostrum, at the outset, 
submits that since this Bench has blocked him, 
therefore, matter may be referred to the Chief Justice 
for its fixation before anyother Bench. Malik Imran 
Khan Thaheem, Advocate, counsel for the petitioner, 
also submits that he has received instructions from his 
client that he has engaged Mr. Bilal Ahmad Sheikh, 
Advocate, therefore, he has no objection for his 
supersession. 
4. 
In normal circumstances, this Bench would not 
take even a minute to transfer the case but from the 
above facts it is crystal clear that engagement of Mr. 
Bilal Ahmad Sh. Advocate in this case is a calculated 
move on the part of the petitioner to get the case 
transferred from this Bench to another, which he 
perceives to be favourable for him. Initially, he tried to 
get the case transfer on the basis of bail granting order 
passed by some other Bench in another case but when 
he failed to achieve desired result, he very tactfully 
engaged an Advocate, who was blocked by this Bench. 
On the one hand, this act of the petitioner is coloured 
with malafide while on the other hand, providing 
professional services to the petitioner by Mr. Bilal 
Ahmad Sh. Advocate, despite having knowledge that 
this Bench has already blocked his name is highly 
unprofessional.  It is not expected from a professional 
Advocate to play in the hands of a litigant to create a 

Crl.Misc.No.27751-B/2023                                                                     3 
 
perception of biasness/impartiality upon a Bench for 
transferring the case to someother Bench. If this 
practice is not discouraged with iron hands, then it 
would become very easy for every litigant to control 
fixation of cases. It is well settled by now that it is a 
conscience of a Judge to determine as to recuse himself 
from a case or not and he cannot be tricked by such 
tactics. Reliance is placed on case reported as 
“Independent Media Corporation ..Vs.. Federation of 
Pakistan (PLD 2014 SC 650)”, wherein it has been laid 
down as under:- 
“ 10. In the above context, it may be useful to record that all litigants 
at times, make attempts to avoid hearing certain Benches but at times 
such attempt are not well intentioned. There may even be attempts to 
intimidate or malign judges or institutions of the State and thereby, to 
undermine such individuals or institutions.  
11. 
It is in this context that two instances can be referred to by us. 
When, I (Jawwad S. Khawaja,J.) was a Judge of the High Court, I 
received a letter stating therein that I had illicit relations with women 
folk of the opposite party. The said letter was circulated by me amongst 
the lawyers of the parties. The persons who purportedly wrote this 
letter was summoned in Court on the following day. She appeared in 
court. Her demeanor in Court depicted that she was a simple village 
woman. She admitted that she wrote the said letter. When asked why 
she did so, she replied that she did not want the case to be heard by m 
and was advised by a worldly-wise man in the village to write the letter 
to me and as a consequence the case would be ordered to be placed 
before some other Bench. This approach is unfortunate but is prevalent 
in our society. Judges cannot be tricked by such tactics. If they 
succumb to such tactics they will thereby empower litigants and enable 
them to control fixation of cases and constitution of Benches. 
12. 
There is another instance relating to a commercial matter in 
which a letter was received by me. This letter was purportedly from one 
of the parties to the case. In the letter it was stated that I had been a 
lawyer for one of the parties and was, therefore, biased in favour of the 
opposite side. This letter was also circulated amongst the lawyers of the 
parties at which point the party who was purported to have written the 
letter stood up in court and stated that he had not written the letter and 
in fact he would want the same Bench headed by me to hear the case”.  
13. 
These instances show that there can be reasons, other than 
those that meet the eye, which may motivate a remark or comment. If 
judges do not deal firmly with such remarks (where unfounded) this 
may encourage unscrupulous or uninformed elements into say things 
which may erode the standing, respect and credibility of the Court.  The 

Crl.Misc.No.27751-B/2023                                                                     4 
 
hearing of this case at intervals today is significant. Courts are not to 
succumb to any remark, defamatory or otherwise. It is the conscience 
of the Judge himself which much determine his decision to sit on a 
Bench or not.”  
5. 
Similarly, in case reported as “General R. Parvez 
Musharraf v. Nadeem Ahmad, Advocate (PLD 2014 SC 
585)” it has been laid down as under:- 
“ Judges, it may be noted, do encounter allegations of bias 
and also receive criticism some of which may be expressed in civil 
language while others may be through hate speech or outright 
vilification based on malice. In either even, the Judge by training does 
not allow such vilification to cloud his judgment in a judicial matter. 
Even extremely derogatory language used against Judges does not, by 
itself create bias, as is evident from the negligible number of contempt 
based on scandalisation of Judges, (none leading to a sentence)cited in 
the case titlted Baz Muhammad Kakar v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 
2012 923). Courts, therefore, cannot decide questions of perceived bias 
by accepting the individual and personal views of an aggrieved 
petitioner and thus recuse from a case. It was pointed out to Mr. 
Pirzada, Senior Advocate Supreme Court that if a subjective perception 
of bias could be made a basis for recusal of a Judge merely because the 
petitioner had done things or had taken unconstitutional steps against 
the former Chief Justice, it would be very simple for any litigant not 
want his case to be heard by a particular Judge to start hurling abuses at 
such Judge and thereafter to claim that the Judge was biased against 
him. For litigants and their Advocates it is important to bear this in 
mind while urging ‘perception of bias’ against a Judge.” 
6. 
It is also significant to note that the learned 
counsel, who filed instant second bail application on 
behalf of the petitioner was not only counsel in the first 
bail application but also represented him in another 
case, whereby post arrest bail was granted to him by 
another Bench, therefore, I have no doubt in my mind 
that replacing him by Mr. Bilal Ahmad Sh. Advocate is 
an ulterior and malafide act on the part of the petitioner 
just to avoid hearing of the case from this Bench. 
Falling prey of these strategies would not only 
encourage these type of elements but also bring the 
judicial system in disrepute, therefore, I am not inclined 
to succumb to such tactics.  Since, Mr. Bilal Ahmad Sh. 
Advocate has been blocked by this Bench, therefore, he 

Crl.Misc.No.27751-B/2023                                                                     5 
 
is not allowed to supersede earlier counsel and his 
power of attorney in this regard is not accepted. 
However, keeping in view the principle of natural 
justice and fair trial as envisaged in Article 10-A of the 
Constitution, let notice be issued to the petitioner to 
engage the services of anyother Advocate of his choice.  
7. In order to avoid such malpractice on the part of Mr. 
Bilal Ahmad Sh. Advocate in future, office is directed 
not to accept his power of attorney in any case, assigned 
to this Bench, where he is intended to supersede earlier 
counsel. Relist for 15.06.2023.
