ASIM HAFEEZ, J. 
Petitioner, based on the information 
provided, seeks exercise of jurisdiction under Article 199(1)(b)(ii) of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
2
‘Constitution‟) to inquire and adjudicate the question that under what 
„authority of law‟ respondent No.6 has been appointed, and is 
currently holding the office of Chairman, National Database and 
Registration Authority (the ‘Office’). National Database and 
Registration Authority (the ‘Authority’) is established in terms of 
section 3 of the National Database and Registration Authority 
Ordinance, 2000 (‘Ordinance, 2000‟). Respondent No.6, ranked 
Lieutenant General in the Pakistan Army, is called upon to 
substantiate title to the Office, claimed, which is a public office for 
all intent and purposes. Notices under Order XXVII-A of Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 were issued. Petition was admitted for regular 
hearing in wake of legal issues involved. Written statements were 
submitted by respondent No.5 – Ministry of Interior – and 
respondent No.6 – [claimant of title to the Office].    
2.  
Factual narration: Facts alleged, statedly leading to the 
change of guard at the Authority, claimed contiguity to the news 
item published in the Dawn newspaper of May 6, 2023, disclosing 
factum of initiation of criminal proceedings against some of the 
officials of the Authority [NADRA], accused of accessing data of the 
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) without authorization – Copy of news 
item is attached as Annexure-A. In follow-up thereto, another news 
item appeared in the Dawn newspaper of June 14, 2023, reporting an 
unanticipated resignation by ex-Chairman, NADRA, Tariq Malik. 
Copy of the news item is attached as Annexure-B. One, Mr. Asad Raza 

W.P. No. 12091/2024.

Gillani, took charge as Acting Chairman of the Authority. In 
paragraph 11 of the petition reference was made to some advertisement 
of 06.07.2023 – [captioned: „Job Advertisement for the post of 
Chairman NADRA‟]. Factum of advertisement was not disputed; 
nonetheless no further action was taken pursuant thereto. Shortly 
thereafter, the Caretaker Government introduced Rule-7A in the 
Appointment and Emoluments of Chairman and Members Rules, 2020 
(the ‘Rules, 2020’). Rule-7A reads as, 
“7A. Secondment or deputation. -Notwithstanding anything 
contained in these rules, the Federal Government may, when it 
considers expedient in national interest, appoint any serving 
officer of the service of Pakistan, not below the rank and status of 
BPS-21, as Chairman on secondment or deputation for such term 
or terms as provided for in sub-section (5) of section 3 of the 
Ordinance.”  
3.  
It transpired from the contents of the written statement by 
Respondent No.5, that selection committee considered officers, 
comprising of the list of officers provided by the Establishment 
Division and Interior Division, and recommended three officers for 
the consideration of Caretaker Government. Caretaker Government 
approved the appointment of respondent No.6, notified through the 
Notification of 02.10.2023, contents thereof are reproduced 
hereunder.

5.  
Fundamentally, title to the Office, claimed by respondent No.6 
while banking upon Rule-7A of the Rules 2020, is subject of 
adjudication.  
6.  
Petitioner submits that Federal Government lacked authority 
to appoint a serving officer to the Office under the Ordinance, 2000. 
Further submits that Rule-7A of the Rules, 2020 is inconsistent with 
the mandate of the enactment, contravenes the constitutional principle 
of equality of the citizens and abrogates guaranteed fundamental rights. 
Adds that incumbent government merely rubber-stamped the 
appointment, unlawfully made by the Caretaker Government without 
adhering to the requirements of conducting fair and competitive 
process for appointment by inviting potential aspirants. 
7.  
Learned Additional Attorney General submits that question of 
vires of Rule-7A of the Rules, 2020 and plea of contravention of 
fundamental rights cannot be adjudged in exercise of quo-warranto 
jurisdiction, when neither the petitioner did compete for the Office, and 
nor aspirant thereto. Further submits that Federal Government is 
competent to undertake rule-making exercise under the mandate of 
section 44 of the Ordinance, 2000, which authority inter alia included 
the power to amend the rules. Submits that appointment was made 
under Rule-7A, ibid, and when discretion was exercised in terms 
thereof, there was no requirement of issuing a public advertisement or 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
6
to undertake competitive recruitment process. Adds that appointment 
was confirmed in national interest, and to justify appointment certain 
documents were provided - [privilege is claimed in respect of the 
documents provided]. 
8.  
Respondent No.6, represented through independent counsel, 
claimed that qualifications prescribed under sub-section (7) of section 3 
of the Ordinance, 2000 are met and legal authority, to hold the Office, 
is drawn from Rule-7A of the Rules, 2020. 
Matter heard:  
Opinion of the Court: 
9.  
Challenge thrown to the claim to the Office is two-faceted; 
firstly, it underlines illegality committed by the Caretaker Government; 
and secondly, the authority of incumbent government, to confirm 
appointment upon ratifying Rule-7A of the Rules, 2020, is questioned 
in the context of delegation under the Ordinance, 2000. 
10. 
 
I now turn to deal with the first challenge. Illegality 
committed, in purported exercise of authority by the Caretaker 
Government, while amending the Rules, 2020 and appointing 
respondent No.6, need not be elaborated and dealt with independently, 
for the reason that incumbent government has accepted and 
acknowledged the baggage of appointment, which in fact endorsed it 
by confirming the insertion of Rule-7A in the Rules, 2020 and also 
confirmed the appointment. Hence, cause of action survives. 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
7
11. 
Is Court competent to assume jurisdiction and what shall be 
the scope of inquiry to determine the claim to the Office. Essentially, 
the scope and extent of adjudication involves determination of legality 
of the claim to hold the Office and an intertwined issue, that whether 
the authority purportedly exercised by the Federal Government is 
within the bounds of the Ordinance, 2000. An intertwined issue is in 
fact an elephant in the room. There is no disagreement over the power 
of the Federal Government to appoint the Chairman of the Authority, 
which is an essential component of delegated authority but subjected to 
the constraints prescribed under the Ordinance, 2000 – primary 
enactment. Notwithstanding, delegation of rule-making authority, the 
appointment must conform to the dictates of the primary enactment. 
Reference to primary enactment is indispensable in the context that 
Federal Government claimed that the appointment is confirmed under 
Rule-7A of the Rules, 2020, which provided for appointment of 
respondent No.6 in national interest. Lawfulness of this purported 
exercise of delegated authority has to be tested through the prism of the 
Ordinance, 2000.   
12. 
The extent of the power / jurisdiction of the Court, to 
determine the legality of delegated authority exercised by the Federal 
Government is subject to frontal attack on the ground that scope of 
„quo-warranto‟ jurisdiction is limited.  
    
In these circumstances, the scope of jurisdiction, conferred 
under Article 199(1)(b)(ii) of the Constitution, needs a sharper focus. 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
8
Though not explicitly stated but the jurisdiction conferred under Article 
199(1)(b)(ii) of the Constitution, is, quintessentially, „quo-warranto‟ 
jurisdiction. Boxes, defining the ingredients required for assumption of 
jurisdiction, are all ticked; that is that requisite information is laid 
before the Court, whereby challenge to the title to the Office is raised; 
Office in question, having a defined and extendable tenure, possesses 
all attributes of a substantive position / post and qualifies to be a public 
office. And, even otherwise, it is not claimed that appointment under 
reference is either provisional or a stopgap arrangement.   
13. 
Jurisprudentially construed, through judicial pronouncements, 
and contextually examined, jurisdiction conferred under Article 
199(1)(b)(ii) of the Constitution essentially empowers the court to 
inquire into and determine the legality or otherwise of the claim to the 
public office, which inter alia includes power to determine claim of 
competence-cum-eligibility of the holder of the Office [the „eligibility 
test‟]. And the jurisdiction extends and enables the Court to test that 
whether the appointing authority possessed the competence to make the 
appointment under challenge [“competence test”]. In the context of 
determination of competence test, it is a sheer misconception that 
merely upon referring to Rule-7A of the Rules, 2020, the jurisdiction, 
otherwise available to inquire into the allegation of invalid 
appointment, would cease to be available. Power to adjudge and 
determine the scope of delegated authority forms an integral part of the 
„quo warranto‟ jurisdiction, which entitles the court to reject alleged 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
9
claim to the public office, if it reaches conclusion that exercise of 
delegated authority is beyond the scope of delegation or otherwise 
inconsistent with the primary enactment. Use of specific expression 
„authority of law‟, in Article 199(1)(b)(ii) of the Constitution, is the 
preface of the „quo warranto‟ jurisdiction. Specificity intended requires 
due deference. Any confusion must be dispelled by highlighting that 
constitutionality of any provision of the Ordinance, 2000 is not under 
challenge but question of legality of the delegated authority exercised. 
Settlement of this delicate, but critical question, is vital. 
14. 
First, I deal with the eligibility test. Notably, appointment was 
confirmed by drawing strength from Rule-7A of the Rules, 2020. It is 
not disputed that appointment under reference is an instance of direct 
appointment, which was not advertised; no qualification-based 
evaluation was conducted, and no exercise to ascertain relative 
suitability of potential-cum-eligible aspirants was carried out. A non-
advertised and competitive deficient appointment is otherwise held 
contrary to the mandate of Article 18 of the Constitution. Reference is 
made to the case of “MUSHTAQ AHMAD MOHAL and others Vs. 
Honourable Lahore High Court, Lahore and others” (1997 SCMR 
1043), relevant paragraphs are reproduced hereunder, 
17.  
We reiterate that the appointments to various posts by the Federal 
Government, Provincial Governments, Statutory Bodies and other Public authorities, 
either initial or ad hoc or regular, without inviting applications from the public 
through the press, is violative of Article 18 read with  Article 2A of the Constitution, 
which has incorporated the Preamble to the Constitution as part of the same and 
which inter alia enjoins equality of opportunity and guarantees for creation of an 
egalitarian society through a new order, which objective cannot be achieved unless 
every citizen equally  placed or situated is treated alike and is  provided equal 
opportunity to compete inter alia for the posts in aforesaid Government set-
ups/institutions.  

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
10
20. 
We may observe that Article 27 of the Constitution is to be read in conjunction 
with inter alia Articles 2A, 18 and 25 of the Constitution. Aforesaid Articles 2A and 18 
of the Constitution have already been referred to hereinabove. Whereas above Article 
25 of the Constitution guarantees that all citizens are equal before law and are entitled 
to equal protection and that they shall not be discriminated on the basis of sex alone. 
Inter alia the above Articles of the Constitution are designed, intended and directed to 
bring about an egalitarian society based on Islamic concept of social justice. 
[Emphasis supplied] 
    
Ratio laid is, recently, re-affirmed in the case of “ZAFARAN 
KHAN and others. Vs. NIZAM ULLAH and others.” (PLD 2023 SC 371), 
portion from paragraph 7 thereof is reproduced hereunder, 
7. 
Now we have to consider whether the precedents of this Court, relied upon by 
the High Court in its judgment, are relevant to the moot question. To answer this point 
it is necessary to read all those precedents, and upon their reading, we found that in all 
of them the appointments were declared illegal on the ground that they were made 
through backdoor, as neither the vacancies were advertised, applications were not 
invited, nor the formalities of the rules were fulfilled, but here we are not confronted 
with such a situation, and thus to provide an answer to the main question under 
consideration, reliance on precedents was inappropriate. Lest anyone misunderstand 
this, we make it clear that the appointment to any post under the government can 
only be made after a proper advertisement has been made inviting applications from 
eligible candidates and holding of selection by a body of experts or a specially 
constituted committee whose members are fair and impartial, through a written 
examination or interview or some other rational criteria for judging the inter se merit 
of candidates who have applied in response to the advertisement made. Any 
appointment made on a post under the government without issuing advertisement, 
inviting applications from eligible candidates and without holding a proper selection 
where all eligible candidates get a fair chance to compete would violate the guarantee 
enshrined under Articles 18 and 27 of the Constitution”  
[Emphasis supplied]  
 
 
Eligibility test has no relevance since appointment was made 
in national interest and not through competitive recruitment process. 
15. 
Now, I discuss the competence test, in wake of jurisdictional 
objection that legality of exercise of delegated authority cannot be 
tested under the „quo warranto‟ jurisdiction. This precise objection is 
addressed in terms of the ratio of decision in the case of „JAWAD 
AHMAD MIR v. Prof. Dr. IMTIAZ ALI KHAN, VICE CHANCELLOR, 
UNIVERSITY OF SWABI, DISTRICT SWABI, KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA 
and others‟ (2023 SCMR 162), relevant portions from paragraphs 8 and 
9 of the decision are reproduced hereunder, 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
11
8.  
The writ of quo warranto is in the nature of setting forth an 
information before the High Court against a person who claimed and usurped 
an office, franchise or liberty. The rationality of the writ of quo warranto is to 
settle the legality of the holder of a statutory or Constitutional office and 
decide whether he was holding such public office in accordance with 
law or against the law. The writ of quo warranto can be instituted by a 
person though he may not come within the meaning of words "aggrieved 
person". For the purpose of maintaining a writ of quo warranto there is no 
requirement of an aggrieved person, and a whistle blower need not to be 
personally aggrieved in the strict sense and may relay the information to the 
court to enquire from the person holding public office. The purpose of the writ 
of quo warranto is to pose a question to the holder of a public office: "where is 
your warrant of appointment by which you are holding this office?" In the writ 
of quo warranto no special kind of interest in the relator is needed, nor is it 
necessary to explain which of his specific legal rights is infringed. It is enough 
for this issue that the relator is a member of the public and acts bona fide. This 
writ is more in the nature of public interest litigation where undoing of a 
wrong or vindication of a right is sought by an individual for himself, or for 
the good of the society, or as a matter of principle. The conditions necessary 
for the issuance of a writ of quo warranto are that the office must be public 
and created by a statute or Constitution itself; the office must be a substantive 
one and not merely the function of an employment of a servant at the will 
during the pleasure of others; there has been contravention of the Constitution 
or a statute or statutory instrument by appointing such person to that office. 
The essential grounds for issuing a writ of quo warranto are that the holder of 
the post does not possess the prescribed qualification; the appointing 
authority is not the competent authority to make the appointment and 
that the procedure prescribed by law has not been followed. The 
burden of proof is then upon the appointee to demonstrate that his 
appointment is in accordance with the law and rules. It is clear that before a 
person can claim a writ of quo warranto, he must satisfy the court, inter alia, 
that the office in question is a public office and is held by a usurper without 
legal authority, and that necessarily leads to the enquiry as to whether the 
appointment of the said alleged usurper has been made in accordance with 
law or not. 
9.  
In our jurisdiction, compliant with the dictum laid down by this Court 
in various judgments, such as the case of Masudul Hassan v. Khadim Hussain 
and another (PLD 1963 SC 203), it was held that writ of quo warranto was in 
its nature an information lying against a person who "claimed or usurped an 
office, franchise or liberty" and was intended to enquire by what authority he 
supported his claim in order that the right to the office may be determined. In 
the case of Capt. (Retd.) Muhammad Naseem Hijazi v. Province of Punjab and 
others (2000 SCMR 1720), this Court held that in the writ of quo warranto, 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan the 
High Court in exercise of its Constitutional jurisdiction is competent to 
enquire from any person, holder of a public office to show that under what 
authority he is holding the said office. Whereas in the case of Hafiz Hamdullah 
v. Saifullah Khan and others (PLD 2007 SC 52), it was held that the object of 
writ of quo warranto is to determine legality of the holder of a statutory or 
Constitutional office and decide whether he was holding such office 
in accordance with law or was unauthorizedly occupying a 
public office. For issuance of a writ of quo warranto, the person invoking 
the jurisdiction of High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution is not 
required to fulfill the stringent conditions required for bringing himself within 
the meaning of an aggrieved person. Likewise, in the case of Imran Ahmad 
Khan Niazi v. Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif (PLD 2017 SC 265), this Court 
held that Constitutional petition in the nature of a writ of quo warranto was 
maintainable against a Member of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), if he was 
disqualified or did not possess or had lost his qualification, in such behalf. 
Power to disqualify a member in cases where for some reason he escaped 
disqualification at the time of filing his/her nomination papers but such 
fact/event was discovered subsequently, could, in appropriate cases and 
subject to availability of admitted facts or irrefutable evidence be exercised by 
the High Court under Article 199 and by the Supreme Court under Article 
184(3) of the Constitution.” 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
12
    
Inquiry for deciding the question of usurpation of the Office 
empowers the court to test that if the appointment is in accordance with 
the law. In the case of „University of Mysore v. C.D. Govinda Rao 
(AIR 1965 SC 491) principles prescribing requisite conditions, for 
assuming „quo warranto‟ jurisdiction, were explained in paragraph 7, 
portion whereof is reproduced hereunder, 
………..“It is thus clear that before a citizen can claim a writ of quo 
warranto, he must satisfy the Court, inter alia, that the office in question is a 
public office and is held by a usurper without legal authority, and that 
necessarily leads to the enquiry as to whether appointment of the said 
alleged usurper has been made in accordance with the law or 
not’. 
[Emphasis supplied] 
    
The extent of the inquiry to be undertaken in exercise of quo 
warranto jurisdiction has been explained in the case of „Malik NAWAB 
SHER v. Ch. MUNEER AHMAD and others‟ (2013 SCMR 1035), 
portion of paragraph 11 is reproduced hereunder,  
….“In the case of PAKISTAN TOBACCO BOARD v. TAHIR RAZA (2007 
SCMR 97) it was held that in writ of quo warranto the jurisdiction of the Court 
was primarily inquisitorial and not adversarial and thus the Court could 
undertake such inquiry as it may deem necessary in the facts and 
circumstances of the case, including the examination of the entire record and 
such exercise can even be done suo motu even the intension of the High Court 
is not drawn by the party concern.” 
16. 
The scope of „quo warranto‟ jurisdiction is construed 
specifically in the context of the law applicable in particular 
jurisdiction. In Article 226 of the Constitution of India, expression, 
„quo warranto‟ is employed, and in our Constitution jurisdiction 
character of „quo warranto‟ is encapsulated in the expression „authority 
of law‟. Notwithstanding variation in the scope of jurisdiction and use 
of varied expressions, there is an underlying commonality, i.e., that 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
13
either be it an act of the state officer or question of usurpation of the 
Office, the exercise of authority, to be valid and enforceable, must 
conform to the law and the terms of delegation. Absence of delegated 
authority is akin to exercise of authority in excess of delegation, and 
both are amenable to test through „quo warranto‟ remedy in various 
jurisdictions. For understanding the scope of the expression „authority 
of law‟, it is expedient to discuss decisions from foreign jurisdiction. I 
lay my hands on a judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida, where 
quo warranto jurisdiction was exercised, instead of directing the 
petitioner, therein, to resort to seek remedy through declaratory 
judgment action, in case No. SC07-2154, titled „Florida House of 
Representatives, et al. v. The Honourable Charles J. CRIST, Jr., etc. 
(999 So.2d 601 (2008), where the act of the Governor of the State, to 
negotiate compact with Indian Tribes, was held invalid on the premise 
of improper exercise of powers, in absence of any authorization by the 
legislature. Ratio of the decision in „Florida House of Representatives 
v. Christ‟, was reaffirmed in the case No.SC2023-1333, titled „WEST 
FLAGLER ASSOCIATES, LTD., et al., v. RON D. DESANTIS etc., et al. 
(573 F.Supp.3d 260 (D.D.C.2021), wherein relief of quo warranto was 
denied on the premise that legislature had ratified the power of the 
Governor to execute the compact, the reasoning extended to 
distinguishing the case of Florida House of Representatives v. Crist, is 
reproduced hereunder,  
Similarly, Petitioners rely on Florida House of Representatives v. Crist, 999 
So. 2d 601, to support their position that the compact may be challenged through quo 
warranto. But though that case involved the applicability of the writ of quo warranto to 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
14
a gaming compact in Florida, it does not set forth a general rule that gaming compacts 
may be challenged through quo warranto actions. Instead, that case involved the 
specific question of whether the Governor had authority to bind the state to a 
compact without ratification by the Legislature. See id. at 609 (“The issue is whether 
. . . the Governor . . . had constitutional authority to execute the Compact without the 
Legislature’s prior authorization or, at least, subsequent ratification.”). That factual 
background distinguishes the case from Petitioners‟ challenge here, as Petitioners 
challenge the substance of the agreement reached by the Governor and ratified by the 
Legislature rather than the bare ability to act. 
Ultimately, the relief that Petitioners seek is beyond what quo warranto 
provides. We have never used the writ to test the substantive constitutionality of a 
statute, and we decline Petitioners’ implicit invitation to expand the scope of the writ 
here. To do so would serve as an affront to an essential feature of quo warranto—
that it is used to challenge the authority to exercise a state power rather than the 
merits of the action. In addition, considering Petitioners‟ request here would 
undermine the structure of article V of the Florida Constitution, which circumscribed 
our ability to review the substantive constitutionality of a statute and commits that 
review, in the first instance, to the trial courts. 
[Emphasis supplied]  
  
In another case, writ of quo warranto was entertained in case 
No.SC11-592, titled „WHILEY v. SCOTT, (79 So.3d 702 (Fla.2011), 
holding that Governor of the State overstepped his constitutional 
authority and violated the concept of separation of powers. In the case 
No.74311 of „Elvin L. MARTINEZ, Etc. v. Bob MARTINEZ, Etc. (545 
So.2d 1338 (1989)), Supreme Court of Florida declined relief sought 
through writ of quo warranto on the ground that legislature had 
conferred power on the Governor of the State, to call more than one 
special session of the legislature, however, the scope of quo warranto 
jurisdiction was delineated as that „Quo warranto is the proper method 
to test the “exercise of some right or privilege, the peculiar powers of 
which are derived from the State‟. 
17. 
Foreign judgments have persuasive / non-binding effect, but 
their analysis provide an effective tool for comprehending the 
proposition of law and assist in interpreting the legal concepts / 
jurisdictional issues. Reference to decisions from foreign jurisdiction is

made not for the purposes to follow the ratio settled therein, which ratio 
may have relevance in the context of the law regulating „quo warranto‟ 
remedy in the State of Florida, but to understand the extensiveness of 
the expression „authority of law‟, in the context of Article 199(1)(b)(ii) 
of the Constitution. In the context of foreign judgments, discussed in 
preceding paragraph, law in the State of Florida, through „quo 
warranto‟ action, affords a legal remedy to test „the exercise of some 
right or privilege, the peculiar powers of which are derived from the 
State. In the judgments referred from foreign jurisdiction, largely, the 
authority of the state official is subject of adjudication, on the premise 
that whether the action taken, or decision made, is within the bounds of 
constitutionally conferred authority or not. In our jurisprudence, „quo 
warranto‟ remedy permits challenge to the appointment to or holding 
of the public office, but standard for such determination bears similarity 
to the principle(s) applied by the Supreme Court of Florida – wherein 
action / decision of the state official(s) had been subjected to the 
scrutiny in the context of authorization granted or not, under the legal 
framework. And in the same vein, scope of jurisdiction under Article 
199(1)(b)(ii) of the Constitution entitles / empowers this Court to 
inquire and determine that whether appointment to the Office made is 
in accord with the „authority of law‟. This underlying commonality 
persuades me to discuss the decisions from foreign jurisdictions.   

W.P. No. 12091/2024.

To understand the scope and extent of „authority of law‟ it is 
expedient to break down the expression grammatically, by defining the 
words defined in Black‟s law dictionary- 11th Edition Bryan A. Garner.  
Authority:  The official right or permission to act, esp. to act 
legally on another‟s behalf; esp., the power of one person to 
affect another‟s legal relations by acts done in accordance with 
the other‟s manifestations of assent; the power delegated by a 
principal to an agent.  
Law: The aggregate of legislation, judicial precedents, and 
accepted legal principles; the body of authoritative grounds of 
judicial and administrative action…., A statute. [Congress 
passed a law]. 
    
Of, a „preposition‟, links the „authority‟ with „law‟, indicating 
the source or origin. Rephrased, expression „authority of law‟ means 
official right or permission to act, specially to act legally on another‟s 
behalf by virtue of authority, derived from, or granted by, or under the 
prevalent legal system – aggregate of legislation, judicial principles and 
accepted legal principles. Endorsement of acceptance / legitimacy to 
the appointment, otherwise made in excess of the delegated authority or 
contrary to the mandate of the enactment, is an illegality, per se - 
[authority of the legislature to make law and executive‟s domain to act 
and enforce legislative command in exercise of delegated authority, as 
delegatee, operate in their respective sphere(s) and context]. For the 
purposes of assumption and exercise of „quo warranto‟ jurisdiction, 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
17
scope of inquiry cannot be extended to include determination of the 
authority / competence of the legislature or for that matter embarking 
upon examining the vires / constitutionality of the law - for instance 
vires of sub-section (3) of section 3 of the Ordinance, 2000, which 
authorize the Federal Government to appoint the Chairman and 
Members to the Authority, or the wisdom of the legislature to delegate 
such authority to delegatee cannot be adjudged in guise of „quo 
warranto‟ jurisdiction. Notably the reliance of Federal Government is 
on Rule-7A of the Rules, 2020, which is a specie of delegated 
legislative authority, being subordinate to the parent enactment.  
18.   
Legality and extent of exercise of delegated authority can be 
adjudged under „quo warranto‟ action. Guidance is solicited from 
decision in the case of „Pir ILLAHI BAKSH v. MUHAMMAD AYOOB 
KHUHRO‟ (PLD 1956 Sind 101), wherein exercise of authority by 
Governor-General was tested by the lordships, each of the three of them 
had recorded opinions separately but concurred on the conclusions 
drawn. In said case „quo warranto‟ was allowed and the then sitting 
Chief Minister of Sindh was de-seated, upon recording judicial findings 
that Governor-General had no authority to reduce the period of 
disqualification of the holder of Office through subsequent order, on 
the premise that the then existing legal framework does not authorize 
the Governor-General to amend its previous order, whereby same had 
earlier disqualified the holder of Office - respondent therein - for the 
period of six years and thereafter reduced said period, facilitating 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
18
assumption of the office of Chief Minister. Ratio settled depicts that 
authority of the Governor-General, purportedly exercised in terms of 
section 4 of the Public and Representative Offices (Disqualification) 
Repeal Act, 1954, was questioned, which was found devoid of any 
lawful authorization. And legality of Governor General‟s action was 
examined in the context of and upon construction of provision(s) of 
law. The authority applies to the proposition under consideration. 
19. 
There is another aspect. Assumption and exercise of „quo 
warranto‟ jurisdiction largely depends on the nature of action, and in 
particular the relief claimed – in the case at hand the petitioner has not 
challenged any official act of respondent No.6 but had sought 
indulgence of the court to inquire that „by what authority‟ respondent 
No.6 is claiming alleged title to the office. The extent of the authority 
available to the appointing authority is subject to test of „quo warranto‟ 
jurisdiction. And it is fallacious to think that action of the appointing 
authority, despite being in excess of the delegated authority, is immune 
from judicial review under „quo warranto‟ jurisdiction. And likewise, 
when appointment made by the appointing authority – in capacity of 
delegatee – is found inconsistent with the legislative command, „quo 
warranto‟ remedy is available for ascertaining the extent of 
inconsistency. In this case Federal Government, in exercise of rule-
making authority, through Rule-7A of Rules, 2020, had provided 
mechanism for direct and unadvertised appointment. Whether such 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
19
course is permissible under the primary enactment – this constitutes a 
crucial component of the controversy and is dealt with at proper place. 
20. 
In view of the above, objection to the assumption of 
jurisdiction is dismissed, and it is held that court is empowered to 
inquire and determine that if exercise of authority by the Executive / 
Federal Government, in the guise of Rule-7A of the Rules, 2020, is 
authorized by, or otherwise, consistent with the terms of delegation 
under the enactment and purpose thereof.  
    
I now proceed to decide the underlying controversy that 
„whether act of direct appointment of respondent No.6 is legally 
covered within the terms of delegation and is in accord with the 
conditions prescribed, regarding appointment of Chairman, in the 
enactment, which is the Ordinance, 2000‟. 
21. 
There is no disagreement that appointment of respondent No.6 
was not pursuant to any public advertisement or competitive 
recruitment process – no such open or competitive process was adopted 
by the Caretaker Government and nor by the incumbent government, 
while confirming the appointment. [Caretaker Government carried a 
limited, in-house, suitability assessment amongst the hand-picked 
officers.] Federal Government conceded that appointment was 
confirmed in national interest and Rule-7A of the Rules 2020, 
authorized the Federal government to dispense with the requirements of 
qualification-based evaluation or adopting competitive recruitment 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
20
process. Whether the Federal Government is empowered, in terms of 
the delegated authority, to make appointment in such cryptic manner.  
22. 
Textual reading of relevant provisions of the enactment – the 
Ordinance, 2020 – affirm that no direct appointment, albeit in the 
national interest, is permissible. Whether a delegatee could proceed to 
claim authority for making direct appointment, on the premise of 
implied or implicit delegation. To determine the context of implied or 
implicit delegation, the legislative intent and scope of delegated 
authority needed focus. In the present context, Federal Government is 
empowered to make appointment of the Chairman and Members in 
terms of sub-section (3) of section 3 of the Ordinance, 2000. Does this 
power include the power to make direct appoint without adhering to the 
standard of qualification-based appointment. Simplicitor, conferment of 
authority to make appointment, without prescription of qualifications in 
the enactment may be construed as extending implied power, to the 
delegatee, to prescribe requisite qualifications, and where required, 
make direct appointment. However, no such power or prerogative has 
been conferred on the Federal Government under the primary 
enactment. Legislature, through the enactment, had prescribed 
qualifications for the Office and no discretion was extended to the 
delegated authority to vary the qualifications or disregard them. 
Qualifications for the Office are prescribed in terms of sub-section (7) 
of section 3 of the Ordinance, 2000. Sub-section (3) of section 3 of the 
Ordinance, 2000, that authorizes Federal Government to appoint 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
21
Chairman, cannot be interpreted or construed to extend authority to the 
Federal Government to make direct or non-advertised appointment(s) to 
the Office, dispensing with the process of qualification-based 
evaluation envisaged under the enactment. It is expedient to examine 
sub-section (7) of section 3 of the Ordinance, 2000, which reads as, 
Section (3) 
……… 
(7). The Chairman shall be an eminent professional of known integrity 
and competence with substantial experience in the field of computer 
science, 
engineering, 
statistics, 
demography, 
law, 
business, 
management, finance, accounting, economics, civil or military 
administration, or the field of registration.” 
 
23. 
Qualifications prescribed in the enactment need to be read in 
juxtaposition to the specifications / requirements under Rule-7A of the 
Rules 2020, to understand the inconsistencies therein – Rule-7A makes 
no reference to the qualifications prescribed under sub-section (7) of 
section 3 of the Ordinance, 2000. Non-obstante effect extended to Rule-
7A, ibid, is to the extent of anything contained in the Rules, 2020, and 
not otherwise. Rule-7A, ibid, envisages and provides mechanism for 
making direct appointment; empowering the Federal government to 
appoint any serving officer of the service of Pakistan, not below the 
rank and status of BPS-21, on secondment or deputation, if deemed 
expedient in the national interest. Such discourse / mechanism is clearly 
inconsistent with the enactment, which specifically prescribed the 
qualifications for the office of Chairman. The enactment, furthermore, 
confers no authority unto the Federal Government, to resort to direct 
appointment in wake of alleged national interest. Unarguably, resorting 
to mechanism or making of direct appointment, without qualification-

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
22
based evaluation and determining relative suitability, is impermissible 
and any appointment made in disregard of qualifications tantamount to 
abuse / excessive exercise of delegated authority, contrary to the terms 
of the delegation and incongruent with the declared purpose of the 
enactment – appointment through qualification-based evaluation. Rule 
making authority is exercised within the limitations prescribed and 
powers extended in terms of primary enactment and no transgression is 
permissible. Rule-making authority is not in dispute, but fatal objection 
is that purported exercise of authority is excessive and in direct conflict 
with the conditions / limitations prescribed under the enactment. Is 
Federal Government authorized to draft a rule in a manner to flout the 
necessity 
of 
qualification-based 
evaluation, 
intended 
through 
prescription of qualifications in the enactment. No, Federal 
Government cannot travel beyond the terms of delegation or abrogate 
the mandate of the enactment. I am afraid that section 44 of the 
Ordinance, 2000 cannot be construed to allow the delegatee to act to 
vitiate the purpose of the Ordinance, 2000 – no disservice to the statute 
intended. It is absurd to assume that despite provisioning of 
qualifications under the enactment, legislature had simultaneously 
enabled the delegatee to engage in making direct and unadvertised 
appointment. Claim by respondent No.6 to possess the qualifications, in 
absolute terms, is otherwise irrelevant, when no qualification-based 
evaluation was undertaken, while making or confirming the 
appointment. Diversity of fields indicated in sub-section (7) of section 
3 of the Ordinance, 2000 implies ascertainment of relative suitability, 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
23
instead of embarking upon direct appointment to the Office – and most 
unlikely, person centric selection. 
    
In brief, prescribing of qualifications for the Office manifests 
clear legislative command for making merit-based appointments and 
suggests an in-built mechanism to restrict and curtail the powers of the 
appointing authority to indulge in making appointments without 
adhering to the qualification-based evaluation. Without ambiguity, 
provisioning of qualifications, explicitly in the enactment, per se 
negates alleged claim of an implied / implicit authorization by the 
Federal Government for making direct appointment to the Office. 
Aptly, this situation attracts legal maxim „expressio unius est exclusio 
alterius‟ [expression of one thing implies the exclusion of others], 
which mirrors the acknowledged principle, that where a statute has 
conferred a power to do an act and prescribed a mechanism for exercise 
of that power, such power cannot be exercised for the purposes of 
performing the act by adopting a different method, other than what has 
been prescribed. Relevant authorities on the proposition are „Taylor v. 
Taylor‟ (1875(1) Ch D 426) and „GVK Industries Ltd. and another v. Income 
Tax Officer and another‟ (2011 (4) SCC 36). 
24. 
Reliance upon and legality qua appointment claimed in the 
context of Rule-7A of the Rules, 2020 is misplaced. Rule-7A, ibid, 
cannot be construed to sanction purported appointment made in excess 
of the delegated authority and otherwise found inconsistent with 
primary enactment. Rule-7A, ibid, manifests assumption and exercise 
of authority, in fact, not delegated to the Federal Government. This 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
24
eminently is an instance of excessive and unlawful assumption and 
exercise of authority. Federal Government, through insertion of Rule-
7A of Rules, 2020, had attempted to increase its power and authority 
without appreciating that legislature had spoken clearly through the 
enactment and prescribed qualification to quell any ambiguity qua 
manner of appointment to the Office. In these circumstances, exercise 
of authority by the Federal Government to confirm the appointment of 
respondent No.6 to the public office is found incongruous with the 
enactment and otherwise contrary to the terms of delegation – 
inconsistency 
identified 
is 
direct 
versus 
qualification-based 
appointment. Hence, no protection to the claim to the Office can be 
extended.    
25. 
Decision of the Federal Government is not entitled to any 
deference, on the plea that appointment is made in national interest, 
when exercise of delegated authority by the delegatee is unauthorized 
and contrary to the command of the legislature. Rule-making authority 
cannot be abused to claim status or role of the legislature. No 
legislative authorization is available for making direct appointment. 
Throughout the proceedings no plea was raised that appointment and 
manner of appointment – direct and unadvertised – has been ratified by 
the legislature.  
26. 
Claim of national interest requires close attention. Federal 
Government struggled to substantiate the appointment on the premise 
of national interest. It is pleaded that appointment of respondent No.6 
was confirmed in wake of lapses identified, irregularities committed 

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
25
qua the affairs of the Authority, security breaches and compromised 
security benchmark. Learned Additional Attorney General provided 
some documents with dates, contemporaneous to the appointment of 
respondent No.6 by the Caretaker Government. Privilege claimed 
regarding documents is unjustified. Documents referred to an incidence 
of data leakage and formation of Joint Investigation Team to probe into 
the charges, which details appeared in the Dawn newspaper of March 
27, 2024 – [one day before the issuance of Notification of confirmation 
of respondent No.6] - which news item disclosed the factum of probe 
into allegation of compromised data of 2.7 million citizens. Copy of 
news item is attached as Annexure-C. No material is relied on or 
provided to justify alleged national interest. Does it imply that any 
lapse or irregularity in the records of any statutory corporation or 
authority would justify resort to extralegal mechanism, for making 
direct appointment without the need for adoption of competitive 
recruitment process. Mere leakage of data, simplicitor, is no ground to 
abandon qualification-based and meritorious appointment(s). This 
close-door approach entails reduced competitiveness, exacerbates 
social inequalities and curtails professional opportunities, which results 
in intense brain-drain. Seeking refuge behind plea of national interest is 
non justiciable, which in fact violates the principle of separation of 
powers, where in fact the executive had exceeded or over-stepped 
delegated authority and proceeded to introduce an incompatible rule 
vis-à-vis primary enactment. Hence, claim of national interest fails, 
being un-plausible.   

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
26
  Since, appointment made is already found in excess of delegated 
authority, therefore, I find no reason to dilate upon the effect(s) of 
person-centric rule-making in the context of the ratio of decision in the 
case of “Baz Muhammad Kakar and others Vs. Federation of Pakistan 
through Ministry of Law and Justice, Islamabad and others” (PLD 2012 
Supreme Court 870). In wake of dispositive determination of main 
question, I find no reason to discuss ratio of the decision in the case of 
“Waris Meah Vs. (1). The State (2). The State Bank of Pakistan” (PLD 1957 
SC (PAK) 157) to dilate upon the effect of an ex-facie discriminatory 
legislation – for the purposes of ruled inserted through Rule-7A of the 
Rules, 2020 – and discriminatory application thereof. Likewise, no 
occasion arises, in the wake of holding the appointment in excess of the 
authority delegated, to discuss the case of „Jibendra Kishore, etc. v. THE 
PROVINCE OF EAST PAKISTAN‟. (PLD 1957 SC Pak 9), to highlight 
violation of constitutional mandate of „equality before the law‟. 
Argument that on two different occasions the officer(s) in service had 
the privilege of serving as the Chairman of NADRA is without 
substance. An illegality committed previously would not per se validate 
the appointment under reference, not authorized by and in terms of the 
statute. I refrain from commenting on the scope of section 34 of the 
Ordinance, 2000 in particular with reference to the expression, 
„engage‟, in the context when respondent No.6 claims service lien / 
retention of original post, which would be an academic exercise, in 
wake of affirmative findings recorded against the holding of the Office 
by respondent No.6.  

W.P. No. 12091/2024. 
 
27
    
It is alleged that remedy of „quo warranto‟ is of technical 
nature and it is in the discretion of the Court to decline issuance thereof. 
I am afraid that illegality committed by way of an unauthorized 
appointment, by the appointing authority in absence of delegation, 
cannot be covered – one cannot hide the elephant in mouse-hole.  
Hence, discretion necessarily needs to be exercised, to end usurpation 
of the office. In these circumstances, act of confirming the appointment 
of respondent No.6 is unauthorized and otherwise inconsistent with the 
enactment, therefore, without requisite „authority of law‟.  
27. 
Consequently, this petition is allowed, the appointment, 
confirmation and continuing holding of the office of Chairman 
NADRA by respondent No.6 is declared without the „authority of law‟. 
Office shall send copy of this Order to the Federal Cabinet, Ministry of 
Interior and all departments concerned. No order as to the costs.
