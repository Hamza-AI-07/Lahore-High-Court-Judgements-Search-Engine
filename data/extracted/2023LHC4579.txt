Petitioner  by: 
Mr. Atif Ashraf, Advocate 
Respondent No. 1 by: 
Rana Riaz Hanif, Advocate.  
 
ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J. This constitutional Petition seeks 
modification in the impugned Order & Memo of Cost dated 21.01.2023 
passed by Special Judge Rent, Lahore and Judgment & Memo of Cost dated 
07.03.2023 passed by Additional District Judge, Lahore to the extent of 
conditions imposed upon the Petitioner while allowing his Ejectment 
Petition.  
2. 
The brief facts of this case are that the Petitioner instituted an 
Ejectment Petition against Respondent No. 1 (the “Respondent”) seeking his 
eviction from the upper portion of house measuring 3-Marlas bearing Khata 
No. 3, Khatuni Nos. 5 to 6 situated at Jallo, Tehsil Cantonment, District 
Lahore acquired by the Petitioner through registered sale deed bearing 
document No. 1894, Bahi No. 1, Jild No. 853 dated 08.03.2011 registered 
with the Sub Registrar, Wahga Town, Lahore (the “rented premises”). It 
was asserted that the rented premises was leased out to the Respondent in the 
year 2014 through an oral tenancy agreement against the monthly rent of Rs. 
4,000/- which was paid for the first two years but thereafter, the Respondent 
defaulted since 2017 and an amount of Rs. 192,000/- is outstanding towards 
him.

W. P. No. 20915 of 2023 
3. 
The Respondent contested the Ejectment Petition by filing his leave to 
contest in which initial relationship between the landlord and the tenant was 
admitted. It was claimed that the Respondent obtained the rented premises on 
rent in 2014 from the Petitioner but purchased the same through an oral 
agreement to sell in 2016. As such, he is not liable to vacate the rented 
premises or pay the rent from 2017.  
4. 
The Rent Tribunal vide Order dated 20.07.2022 appointed a Court 
representative to ascertain possession over the rented premises. The Court 
representative visited the rented premises and confirmed possession of the 
Respondent over the same.  
5. 
Thereafter, one Ashfaq Ahmad Mian filed an Application under Order 
I, Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the “CPC”) for becoming a 
party to the Ejectment Petition and seeking appointment of local commission 
to ascertain his possession over the rented premises. He claimed that he was 
in possession over the rented premises on the strength of registered sale deed 
No. 7183 dated 10.05.2022. The Rent Tribunal dismissed the said 
Application vide Order dated 12.12.2022 by holding that it is not 
ascertainable from the sale deed that the claimant is in possession of the 
rented premises, the possession of the Respondent over the rented premises 
has already been established in the report of local commission and the 
jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal does not extend to determination of title but 
is confined to disputes qua rented premises. The said Ashfaq Ahmad Mian 
assailed the Order dated 12.12.2022 before the Appellate Court, however, the 
Appeal was dismissed vide Order dated 31.01.2023 as being not maintainable 
having been preferred against an interlocutory order.  
6. 
The Rent Tribunal allowed the Ejectment Petition of the Petitioner vide 
impugned Order dated 21.01.2023 in the following terms:- 
“27. Sequel of above discussion is that the application for leave to 
contest filed by the respondent does not disclose sufficient ground for 
production of oral evidence. Hence, application for leave to contest 
filed by the respondent is dismissed.  
28. Affidavits of Petitioner’s witnesses are available on file, therefore, 
while relying upon the affidavits, the instant ejectment petition is 
allowed. Although, Rent Tribunal shall adopt any kind of equitable 
principle to reach the efficacious decisions. Reliance in this regard is 

3 
W. P. No. 20915 of 2023 
placed on “Muhammad Tariq Khan Vs. Khawaja Muhammad Jawad 
Asami” reported as (2007 SCMR 813). Hence, keeping in view the 
above mentioned principle referred, this ejectment petition is 
conditionally decreed. The condition requires as to be fulfilled by the 
petitioner are given as under.- 
     1. That the ejectment petitioner shall approach the Revenue Officer 
for the purpose of demarcation of the suit property as mentioned 
in his registered sale deed. This decree will be executable only 
when Revenue Officer will authenticate that the subject property 
of this petition falls under Khewat and Khatooni numbers as 
mentioned in his registered sale deed/in this petition. 
  2.  If the Revenue Officer reports that subject property is undivided 
piece of land then petitioner will approach the concerned forum 
for the purpose of partition and the possession will be delivered 
in pursuance of this decree in conjugation of the decree of the 
partition. 
3. Ejectment petitioner will also produce building plan from 
LDA/Municipal Corporation Authority or District Council, 
Lahore so that it can be presumed that infrastructure of the plot 
was build in accordance with law. 
29. If above mentioned conditions are not fulfilled, ejectment 
Petitioner is at liberty to seek alternate remedy against the respondent 
before appropriate forum. Subject to fulfillment of the above mentioned 
conditions, ejectment petitioner can file execution after 45 days is 
given to the respondent namely Mirza Rehmat Ullah to quit the 
demised property where-after, the respondent shall be bound to vacate 
the house without any further delay otherwise the petitioner/landlord 
shall be entitled to adopt due course of law for execution of this order. 
The petitioner has claimed default in payment of rent since the year 
2017 but there is no reasonable explanation available on record as to 
why the petitioner failed to agitate his grievance for such a long time. 
Therefore, the claim of the petitioner for default in amount of 
outstanding rent since the year 2017 is rejected. However, the 
petitioner is held entitled to receive monthly rent from filing of this 
ejectment petition till his eviction alongwith settled annual increment. 
If the respondent produced any rent receipts during pendency of this 
petition then the same shall be liable to waived off to the respondent. It 
is made clear that this final order is not tantamount to declaration of 
ownership in favour of any party to this petition; moreover, no public 
department shall made change in record of ownership on the basis of 
this final order. Execution be filed after verification of fine receipt by 
Muhammad Umair Ahlmad. In case of fine receipt is reported to be 
fake, then this order shall deemed to be vacated. Memo of costs be 
prepared accordingly. File be consigned to record room after its due 
completion and compilation by Ahlmad Muhammad Umair till 5th 
February-2023.” 
7. 
The Petitioner preferred an Appeal against decision of the Rent 
Tribunal to the extent of conditions imposed upon him while allowing his 

4 
W. P. No. 20915 of 2023 
Ejectment Petition. The said Ashfaq Ahmad Mian also preferred his separate 
Appeal. The Appellate Court dismissed both the Appeals vide its separate 
Judgments dated 07.03.2023. The Appeal of the Petitioner was dismissed in 
the following terms:- 
“17. Although respondent while filing application for leave to contest 
submitted that he got the demised property on rent from the 
appellant/ejectment petitioner in the year 2014 and thereafter he 
purchased the same from appellant in the year 2016 through oral 
agreement, yet it is obvious from the record that one Ashfaq Ahmed 
Mian submitted application u/o 1 Rule 10 CPC for impleading him as 
party to the ejectment petition while claiming him to be in possession 
thereof as owner on the basis of registered sale deed No.7183 dated 
10.05.2022 and even he also annexed copy of registered sale deed with 
his application in order to establish his stance. Moreover, said Ashfaq 
Ahmad Mian has also questioned the validity of impugned order 
through independent appeal, which is fixed for today before this court, 
record whereof reflects that said Ashfaq Ahmad Mian has annexed 
attested copy of report of local commission appointed in the suit titled, 
“Ashfaq Ahmad Mian Vs. Mirza Rehmat Ullah etc” and according to 
said report Ashfaq Ahmad Mian was found to be in possession of 
demised property. However, sale deed in favour of Ashfaq Ahmad 
Mian as well as sale deed in favour of Qari Muhammad Qasim i.e. 
ejectment petitioner bear different Khewat Number and both of them 
claim to be owners of demised property on the basis of sale deeds 
existing in their favour and in like situation learned Special Judge Rent 
rightly passed the impugned order subject to fulfillment of following 
conditions:  
i. That the ejectment petitioner shall approach the Revenue 
Officer for the purpose of demarcation of the suit property as 
mentioned in his registered sale deed. This decree will be 
executable only when Revenue Officer will authenticate that the 
subject property of this petition falls under the Khewat and 
Khatooni numbers as mentioned in his registered sale deed in 
this petition. 
ii. If the Revenue Officer reports that subject property is 
undivided piece of land then petitioner will approach the 
concerned forum for the purpose of partition and the possession 
will be delivered in pursuance of this decree in conjugation of 
the decree of the partition. 
iii. Ejectment petitioner will also produce building plan from 
Learned A.D Legal for FIA/Municipal Corporation Authority or 
District Council, Lahore so that it can be presumed that 
superstructure of the plot was build in accordance with law. 
Thus in case, it is found during demarcation proceedings that demised 
property bears the particulars in accordance with the sale deed 
existing in favour of appellant, then he shall definitely be entitled to get 

5 
W. P. No. 20915 of 2023 
possession of said property on the basis of impugned order. Being so, 
there exists no illegality or infirmity in the impugned order. 
Consequently appeal in hand is dismissed with cost. Memo of cost be 
prepared. Copy of this judgment alongwith record of ejectment petition 
be sent back to the learned Trial Court for information, whereas file of 
appeal be consigned to the record room after its due completion.”  
 
8. 
 Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that although the 
Ejectment Petition of the Petitioner has been concurrently allowed but the 
Courts below went beyond their jurisdiction vested under the Punjab Rented 
Premises Act, 2009 (the “Act”) to impose conditions with respect to the 
rented premises in terms of demarcation, partition and sanctioning of 
building plan. This is especially so when the Rent Tribunal had only framed 
two issues regarding relationship of landlord and tenant; and default in 
payment of rent which were decided in favour of the Petitioner. Hence, it was 
completely uncalled on the part of the Courts below to give the aforesaid 
directions regarding the rented premises. Moreso, the Application and Appeal 
of said Ashfaq Ahmad Mian had been dismissed and as such, he was not a 
party to the Ejectment Petition. The sale deed of said Ashfaq Ahmad Mian 
bears no nexus with the rented premises and as such, the Courts below went 
beyond their jurisdiction under the Act to conditionally allow the Ejectment 
Petition. Hence, the impugned Order & Judgment are liable to be modified by 
removing the conditions imposed upon the Petitioner with respect to the 
rented premises. 
9. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that 
although the Respondent initially obtained the rented premises from the 
Petitioner on rent in the year 2014 yet he became an owner after purchasing it 
in 2016 through an oral agreement to sell, therefore, the Respondent is 
entitled to continue his possession over the rented premises. The claims of 
the Petitioner, the Respondent and Ashfaq Ahmed Mian in essence pertain to 
determination of title qua the rented premises and as such, the conditions 
imposed by the Courts below are equitable in nature.  
10. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
11. 
The record depicts that the Petitioner instituted an Ejectment Petition 
contending therein that he leased out upper portion of the rented premises to 

6 
W. P. No. 20915 of 2023 
the Respondent in the year 2014 through an oral rent agreement against 
monthly rent of Rs. 4,000/- which was paid for the first two years but 
thereafter, the Respondent defaulted since 2017 and an amount of Rs. 
192,000/- is outstanding towards him. The Petitioner made repeated requests 
to the Respondent to vacate the rented premises and pay the arrears of rent 
but he consistently refused to do so which necessitated the filing of the 
Ejectment Petition. The Respondent, in his leave to contest, admitted that he 
obtained the rented premises on lease from the Petitioner in the year 2014 but 
claimed that he had purchased the same in 2016 through an oral agreement to 
sell and as such, he was not liable to vacate the rented premises or pay the 
arrears of rent.  
12. 
There is no doubt that the Petitioner had claimed eviction of the 
Respondent from the rented premises on the basis of an oral tenancy 
agreement. As a normal rule, where oral tenancy is denied, leave to contest is 
allowed to determine the relationship of landlord and tenant along with 
ancillary disputed questions of law and fact through recording of evidence. 
However, in the instant case, since the Respondent had admitted that he had 
initially obtained the rented premises on rent from the Petitioner, therefore, 
the relationship of landlord and tenant stood established. Similarly, the 
Respondent had admitted non-payment of rent since 2017 by proclaiming 
ownership of the rented premises on the basis of an oral agreement to sell. 
The Respondent had also acknowledged his possession over the rented 
premises. The Petitioner had produced his title documents regarding the 
rented premises. In contrast, the Respondent did not produce any title 
document to claim his ownership over the rented premises. The claim of the 
Respondent regarding his ownership over the rented premises was based 
upon an oral agreement to sell regarding which he had an adequate remedy 
before the Court of competent jurisdiction for determination of title qua the 
rented premises. 
13. 
The said Ashfaq Ahmad Mian had entered into the pending Ejectment 
Petition by filing an Application under Order I, Rule 10 of the CPC seeking 
to become a party thereto claiming his possession over the rented premises on 
the strength of sale deed No. 7183 dated 10.05.2022. He also requested that a 

7 
W. P. No. 20915 of 2023 
local commission may also be appointed to verify his possession. The said 
Application was concurrently dismissed by the Courts below. The Appellate 
Court while dismissing the Appeal of Ashfaq Ahmed Mian undertook a 
detailed comparison of sale deeds of the Petitioner and the said Ashfaq 
Ahmed Mian. In this behalf, Paragraph No. 7 is reproduced below:- 
“Appellant has also questioned the validity of order dated 21.01.2023, 
whereby ejectment petition was finally accepted, on the grounds that 
he is in possession of demised property as owner on the basis of 
registered sale deed No.7183 dated 10.05.2022 and respondent No.2 
being collusive with the respondent No.3 i.e. so called tenant filed the 
ejectment petition in order to grab the property, which is exclusively 
owned and possessed by him. However, it is obvious from the contents 
of sale deed No.7183 dated 10.05.2022 that the same relates to 
property bearing Khewat No.85, Khatooni No.294 to 314 having total 
land measuring 246 Kanals 1 Marla, situated at Mouza Jallo, Tehsil 
Shalimar as per record of rights for the year 2015/2016 bounded as 
follows: 
East: Plot owned by other person, 
West: Street 20 feet, 
North: Plot owned by Ishtiaq and 
South: Plot owned by other person 
 
whereas respondent No.1 filed the ejectment petition as to house 
measuring 3 Marlas bearing Khewat No.3, Khatooni No. 5 to 6 having 
total land measuring 202 Kanal 19 Marlas situated in Mouza Jallo, 
Tehsil Cantt, District, Lahore as per record of rights of the year 
1996/97 and even according to version of respondent No. 2/ejectment 
petitioner, he purchased total land measuring 12 Marla and houses 
situated at Northern and Southern side of demised property are also 
owned by him and total land falling in all the three houses is 12 Marla. 
Thus it is crystal clear from the contents of sale deed in favour of 
appellant as well as particulars of demised property mentioned in the 
ejectment petition that property alleged to be owned and possessed by 
the appellant is entirely different from that of property mentioned in 
the ejectment petition and respondent No.2 being ejectment petitioner 
shall be entitled to have possession of property owned by him as per 
description mentioned in the ejectment petition, whereas he shall not 
be entitled to have possession of property bearing the description 
contained in sale deed in favour of appellant on the basis of impugned 
order.” 
14. 
The Rent Tribunal had imposed conditions upon the Petitioner based 
upon a misconceived notion that both the sale deeds envisage alienation of 
rights with reference to land located in close proximity. However, the 
Appellate Court conclusively found that the sale deeds of the said Ashfaq 
Ahmed Mian and the Petitioner are not identical. It was thus obvious that the 

8 
W. P. No. 20915 of 2023 
decree of eviction was to be executed with reference to the specific bounded 
property as per the sale deed in favor of the Petitioner. The said Ashfaq 
Ahmed Mian was not a party to the Ejectment Petition since his Application 
for becoming a party thereto had been concurrently dismissed by the Courts 
below. As such, no eviction order was passed against him. The respective 
claims of ownership qua rented premises of the Petitioner and Ashfaq 
Ahmed Mian were beyond the jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal. It is noted 
that the Act has been promulgated to regulate the relationship of landlord 
and tenant with respect to rented premises and for providing an expeditious 
and cost-effective mechanism for settlement of their disputes. The Rent 
Tribunal established under Section 16 of the Act exercises exclusive 
jurisdiction within the ambit and scope of the Act which is limited regarding 
determination of disputes between the landlord and the tenant emanating 
from lease agreements with respect to the rented premises. Therefore, unless 
the relationship of landlord and tenant is not established vis-à-vis the rented 
premises, the Rent Tribunal cannot assume jurisdiction to determine any 
other disputed question between the parties qua the rented premises such as 
the determination of rights and title. The limited jurisdiction extended to the 
Rent Tribunal under the Act is fortified by Section 10 of the Act which 
specifically stipulates that an agreement to sell or any other agreement 
entered into between the landlord and the tenant, after the execution of a 
tenancy agreement, in respect of premises and for a matter other than a 
matter provided under the tenancy agreement, shall not affect the 
relationship of landlord and tenant unless the tenancy is revoked through a 
written agreement entered before the Rent Registrar in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 5 of the Act. Therefore, both the Respondent and the 
said Ashfaq Ahmed Mian have an alternate remedy to resort to a Court of 
competent jurisdiction for determination of their claims of ownership 
regarding the rented premises. Reliance is placed on case titled, “Fareed ud 
Din Masood v. Additional District Judge Bahawalpur and others” (2019 
SCMR 842). As such, the Courts below aptly concluded that the Respondent 
was not entitled for leave to contest and proceeded to allow the Ejectment 
Petition of the Petitioner. However, imposition of conditions mentioned in 

9 
W. P. No. 20915 of 2023 
the impugned Order & Judgment were unjustified and without any 
reasonable basis which had practically denied relief to the Petitioner.  
15. 
In view of the above, this Petition is accepted; the conditions imposed 
by the Rent Tribunal upon the Petitioner and upheld by the Appellate Court 
are set side. The rest of the findings recorded by the Courts below regarding 
eviction of the Respondent and arrears of rent are maintained. Accordingly, 
the impugned Order, Judgment & Memo of Costs dated 21.01.2023 and 
07.03.2023 stand modified in the above terms.
