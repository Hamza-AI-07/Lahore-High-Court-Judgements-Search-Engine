ASIM HAFEEZ, J.  This Intra Court Appeal is directed against order 
of 06.12.2021, whereby learned Single Judge-in-Chambers had 
allowed the constitutional petition bearing W.P.No.1297/2021 and 
directed the Police department to consider respondent for appointment 
as Sub-Inspector.  
  
Briefly the background facts, essential for adjudication, are that 
respondent applied and competed for initial appointment, against the 
post of Sub-Inspector, advertised by the Punjab Public Service 
Commission, Lahore („the Commission‟) vide public advertisement 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
2
No.21/2019 dated 07.07.2019. Respondent was recommended for 
appointment by the Commission. Upon seeking approval, respondent 
was got medically tested and found suffering from partial color 
blindness, who was declared unfit and held disqualified for the post in 
question. And whereupon litigation commenced. 
2. 
Instant appeal is placed before larger Bench, in wake of the 
observations recorded by learned Division Bench while passing order 
of 21.02.2024, which, for ease of reference, is reproduced hereunder 
as:- 
“According to learned Law Officer, criteria laid down in 
notification No.SP(H&D)1-7/65 dated 14.09.1965 (1965 
notification) was applicable to the case of respondent. 
Reliance in this regard has been placed on case "Province of 
the Punjab etc. v. Attique Zaidi etc" decided by this Court in 
ICA No. 162 of 2015. We have gone through the referred 
judgment so relied by learned Law Officer and find that while 
deciding above referred case, provisions of Police Order, 
2002 and Rules framed under Article 112 of the Police Order, 
2002 besides notification No.30/AD/E-II/VI dated 02.01.2014 
(2014 notification) were not brought into the notice of 
learned Division Bench of this Court. In our humble view, 
respondent's case qua his fitness for his fresh appointment as 
Sub Inspector is to be dealt with as per the provisions of 
Police Order, 2002 and Rules framed under Article 112 of the 
Police Order, 2002 besides 2014 notification instead of 1965 
notification. In this backdrop, it would be appropriate that 
Larger Bench may be constituted for a decision through an 
authoritative judgment so as to obviate the possibility of any 
cleavage in the judgments on the moot point”. 
[Emphasis Supplied] 
3. 
Broadly, questions tossed for adjudication are straightforward, 
whereby, in essence determination is sought regarding the scope and 
construction of the Rules, notified through Notification No.30/AD/E-
II/VI dated 02-Jan 2014, and called as Sub-Inspectors and Inspectors 
(Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2013 (Rules 2013). 
And adjudication is sought regarding effect of non-consideration of 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
3
Rules 2013, framed in exercise of powers under Article 112 of the 
Police Order 2002 and implications qua the instructions issued 
through document No.SO(H&D) 1-7/65 dated 14th September 1965 
(Notification of 1965), while rendering judgment in the case of 
“Province of the Punjab etc. v. Attique Zaidi etc.” in ICA No.162 of 
2015 – Judgment in the case of “Attique Zaidi” was challenged but 
leave to appeal was declined by Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan. 
Additionally, an objection of limitation qua instant appeal is also 
raised. 
4. 
After hearing preliminary submissions, learned Law Officers 
(„law officers‟) are asked to dilate upon the effect and consequence of 
not mentioning condition of color blindness as alleged disability in the 
advertisement, where other qualifications were mentioned including 
the required vision standards; and why color blindness be treated as a 
ground for disqualification when such requirement did not find 
mention in the schedule to the Rules 2013, providing minimum 
eligibility qualifications; and if color blindness is not a minimum 
qualification requirement was it fair to consider such deficiency as 
ground for disqualification. 
5. 
Law officers stated that minimum qualifications prescribed in 
schedule to the Rules 2013 were not the only conditions prescribed for 
assessing the eligibility and fitness of the recruit, and such minimum 
qualifications do not place any embargo upon considering requisite 
requirements in terms of Rule 12.16 of Chapter 12 of the Police Rules 
1934. Add that qualifications prescribed in the schedule to the Rules 
2013 indicate bare minimum requirements, which must exist at the 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
4
time of submitting application, and if any candidate does not fulfil 
minimum qualifications, same should not apply in the first place. 
Explain that medical certificates, for purposes of present issue, were 
procured at two different stages, firstly at the time of submission of 
application and other after recommendation by the Commission. 
Further explain that initial medical certificate, for the consumption of 
the Commission, was required for ensuring that prima facie the 
minimum physical qualifications are met, which certificate(s) 
contained limited medical information about the candidate. And post-
recommendation medical certificate is essentially required for the 
purposes of confirming appointment / enrolment, which medical 
certificate is comprehensive and contained conclusive declaration of 
medical fitness. It is emphasized that minimum qualifications in the 
Rules 2013 are neither exhaustive nor same be construed as all-
inclusive qualifications. Law officers read Rules 13 and 14 of the 
Rules 2013 to emphasize that no absolute exclusion of the conditions / 
requirements under Rule 12.16 of Chapter 12 of Police Rules 1934 or 
requisite vision standards, provided in the Notification of 1965, was 
intended and instead limited overriding effect was extended, barely to 
the extent of any inconsistency found in Rule 12.16 ibid or prescribed 
vision standards. Submit that no absolute exclusion can otherwise be 
implied vis-à-vis other requisite eligibility and fitness requirements. 
Further submit that irrespective of the recommendation of Public 
Service Commission no candidate could be enrolled or deemed 
appointed unless same is declared medically fit in terms of the 
certificate issued under Rule 12.16 of Police Rules 1934.  

ICA No.37/2022

On query, law officers responded that nature of the duties to be 
performed in any Functional Unit of the Police Department were not 
specified in the advertisement therefore claiming fitness for 
assignment of duty in any particular Functional Unit in the department 
- where deficiency of color blindness does not otherwise hamper 
performance of duties – is misconceived and unwarranted, in the 
context of the advertisement under reference. Add that department 
may seek recruitment for any particular Functional Unit and may 
specifically exclude deficiency of color blindness, in the context of 
nature of the duties to be performed, but then schedule to the Rules 
2013 requires tweaking. Law officers dwelled upon the distinctive 
concepts of eligibility and fitness, and cited following decisions 
reported as Government of Punjab through Secretary (S&GAD), 
Lahore and another V. Zafar Maqbool Khan and others (2012 SCMR 
686), Muhammad Anis and others V. Abdul Haseeb and others (PLD 
1994 Supreme Court 539). Add that applicability and relevancy of 
Police Rules 1934, notwithstanding promulgation of Police Order 
2002, are acknowledged in the case of Syed Hammad Nabi and others 
V. Inspector General of Police Punjab, Lahore and others (2023 
SCMR 584). 
6. 
Conversely, learned counsel appearing for respondent objected 
to the maintainability of instant Appeal on the question of limitation – 
emphasizing that authorization for preferring appeal was procured 
after lapse of time provided for removal of office objections. On 
merits, submits that Rules 13 and 14 of the Rules 2013, read 
conjointly, comprehensively provided qualifications to recruit Sub-
Inspectors and no qualification, other than the qualifications 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
6
prescribed in the Rules 2013, could be used as pretext to disqualify 
the respondent. Adds that borrowing of any ground for 
disqualification, by resorting to Rule 12.16 of Police Rules 1934 or 
vision standards in the Notification of 1965, is impermissible under 
the Rules 2013. Adds that qualifications provided in the advertisement, 
relating to vision standards, were mirror image of the qualifications 
mentioned in the schedule to the Rules 2013, which is not a co-
incidence but manifestation of affirmation of completeness of the 
qualifications in the schedule, which conspicuously does not prescribe 
color blindness as a disability or purported ground for disqualification. 
It is emphasized that color blindness is per se no disqualification. 
Reference is made to the regulations by the Federal Public Service 
Commission, where color blindness was not prescribed as 
disqualification for recruitment in the police department – and such 
deficiency was only a disqualification for seeking appointment against 
certain posts in the department of Railways. Explained that in 
developed and even in developing countries color blindness is not at 
all a disability or a ground to deny appointment, even in the police 
department. Learned counsel relies upon the case of Union of India V. 
Satya Prakash Vasisht [1994 SCC (L&S) 792, 2], and argues that 
candidate was appointed as Police Inspector (Executive) despite 
suffering from color blindness. On point of limitation, learned counsel 
read the opinion of the Solicitor‟s department to demonstrate that 
procuring of permission was after lapse of time provided for removal 
of office objections, whereby seven days were provided, and appeal 
was re-filed after expiry of original period of limitation.

Heard. Record perused.

8. 
Question, in particular that whether defective vision, on account 
of color blindness, constitutes a prohibition for the appointment in the 
police department, be it the issue of appointment of constable(s) or the 
Inspectors, repeatedly came up for adjudication before various learned 
Single Benches of this Court and was conclusively answered, against 
the candidates, by virtue of decision dated 14.02.2019 passed by 
learned Division Bench of this Court while deciding ICA No.162 of 
2015 titled “Province of the Punjab, etc. V. Attique Zaidi, etc.” And 
said decision was unsuccessfully challenged before Hon‟ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan. Apparently, settled question of law, having factual 
trappings, is re-agitated on the premise that learned Division Bench 
had not appreciated conspicuous and meaningful change in the 
statutory framework brought by Police Order 2002 and largely the 
effect of the Rules 2013, framed in exercise of powers under Article 
112 of Police Order 2002. Fundamentally, determination-cum-
decision is sought qua the construction of Rules 13 and 14 of the 
Rules 2013, applicability and effect thereof, especially in the context 
of requirements / vision standards prescribed under the Notification of 
1965. It is expedient to reproduce Rules 13 and 14 of the Rules 2013, 
which read as, 
“(13) Method of recruitment, appointment and eligibility.- 
The method of recruitment, minimum qualifications, age limit 
and other incidental matters for the posts of Sub-Inspectors 
and Inspectors in the functional unit shall be such as given in 
the Schedule appended to these rules. 
(14) 
Overriding effect.- These rules shall have effect 
notwithstanding anything contrary contained in Chapters 12 
and 13 of the Police Rules, 1934”. 
9. 
Learned counsels are poles apart in construing Rules 13 and 14 
of the Rules 2013. Learned counsel for the respondent pleaded, firstly, 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
8
that express conditions provided in the Rules 2013 and schedule 
thereto command exclusivity in its application; and secondly, the 
Rules 2013, characterized as special instrument on the subject, calls 
for preferential treatment over the general conditions, while relying on 
the principle of statutory construction, “that special legislation, 
subsequent in time, excludes applicability of general law on the 
subject”.  
  
Conversely, it is argued by the law officers that question of 
absolute exclusion only arises if subsequent special legislation is 
exhaustive or all-inclusive within itself and not otherwise.  
10. 
Context being the advertisement under reference, controversy 
boils down to a fundamental question that whether the Rules 2013, 
and conditions prescribed therein, have to treated and read as 
exhaustive or all-inclusive conditions, admitting of no other 
qualifications / conditions for the purposes of considering eligibility 
of the respondent, notwithstanding the vision standards provided in 
Rule 12.16 of Police Rules 1934, appendix thereto or Notification of 
1965. At first blush and upon threadbare analysis, textual reading of 
Rule 14 of the Rules 2013 clearly suggests that over-riding effect 
provided in terms thereof is not absolute but cautiously qualified – 
seemingly limited and preference extended to the extent of any 
inconsistency, if found qua Chapters 12 and 13 of Police Rules, 1934. 
Rules 13 and 14 of the Rules 2013 complement each other, which 
require conjunctive reading.  
  
Argument by respondent‟s counsel that absolute exclusivity 
was extended to the minimum qualifications in the schedule by virtue 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
9
of Rule 14 of the Rules 2013, in the context of other requisite 
qualifications, is wrong on two-counts. Firstly, absolute exclusion of 
other conditions, available and attracted in terms of Rule 12.16 of the 
Police Rules 1934 and appendix thereto was neither intended nor any 
such effect could be extended while undertaking recruitment, unless 
any particular requirement under Chapter 12 of the Police Rules 1934 
is found contrary to the qualifications identified in the schedule to the 
Rules 2013. Expression “these rules shall have effect notwithstanding 
anything contrary contained in Chapters 12 and 13 of the Police 
Rules 1934” must be accorded due deference, as long as Rules are not 
amended to otherwise limit or expand the scope of inconsistency(ies). 
Hence, overriding effect is restricted to the extent of inconsistency 
and not otherwise. Mere non-mentioning of any qualification, 
otherwise identified in the Rule 12.16 and appendix thereto or in the 
Notification of 1965, could not be construed as conscious omission. 
Evidently, Rules 2013 are not a complete code in itself. Secondly, 
alternate plea that indication of express conditions entails implied 
repeal of the requirements under Rule 12.16 of the Police Rules 1934 
is also without substance. No question of implied repeal arose upon 
textual reading of Rule 14 of the Rules 2013. Argument is otherwise 
illogical. No recruit could claim absolute entitlement to the 
appointment against post under reference, simply upon claiming 
fulfillment of minimum qualifications in the schedule to the Rules 
2013. It is reiterated that qualifications prescribed in the schedule 
constitute bare minimum requirements, which have to be read in 
conjunction with other applicable qualifications, not otherwise 
inconsistent. Bare recommendations by the Commission were not 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
10
enough to secure appointment, unless medical fitness of the recruit is 
certified in terms of Rule 12.16 of the Police Rules 1934. Rule 12.16 
is reproduced hereunder, for ease of reference,  
12.16. Recruits-Medical examination of. - (1) Every 
recruit shall, before enrolment, be medically examined 
and certified physically fit for service by the Civil 
Surgeon. A certificate, in the prescribed form (10.64), 
signed by the Civil Surgeon personally, is an essential 
qualification for enrolment - (vide Fundamental Rule 
10). 
The examination by the Civil Surgeon will be 
conducted in accordance with the instructions issued 
by the medical department and will test the eyesight, 
speech and hearing of the candidate, his freedom from 
physical defects, organic or contagious disease, or any 
other defect or tendency likely to render him unfit, and 
his age. The candidate must strip for examination, a 
loin covering being allowed except when the 
examination is being completed, and any candidate 
who refused to do so must be rejected. The conditions 
of police service make it necessary that the medical 
examination of candidates should be strict. Candidates 
shall be rejected for any disease or defect which is 
likely to render them unfit for the full duties of a police 
officer. 
(2) Superintendents are themselves responsible for 
rejecting candidates whose general standard of 
physique and intelligence is unsatisfactory; only those 
candidates should be sent for medical examination 
whom the Superintendent has accepted as being up to 
the required standards in these respects. (See 
Appendix 12.16). 
  
For convenience, Rule 10.64 is also reproduced, on account of 
its reference in the Rule 12.16 of Police Rules 1934:- 
“10.64. Health and age certificates. - A medical 
certificate of health is required in support of the first 
claim made for the pay of a person substantively 
appointed to a permanent post in Government service. 
Such certificate shall, in all cases of appointments in 
the police department be in Form 10.64 and shall be 
signed by the Civil Surgeon of the district in which the 
appointment is made. In the case of all provincial and 
subordinate service officers who receive their first 
permanent appointments in ranks of and above that of 
sub- inspector, the health certificate shall be attached 
to the first pay bill. In the case of persons who receive 
their first appointments in lower subordinate rank the 
health certificates shall be attached immediately to 
their character rolls (or, in the case of non-enrolled 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
11
establishment, service books) and a certificate to the 
effect appended to the standard form of lower 
subordinates' pay bill. When a lower subordinate is 
promoted to the rank of assistant sub-inspector, his 
date of birth or age, according to the health certificate 
granted on his first appointment to Government 
service, shall be endorsed on the bill in which his new 
pay is first drawn. 
11. 
Rule 12.16 of Police Rules 1934 and appendix thereto talk of 
mandatory requirement of the medical certificate, before declaring 
candidate eligible and fit for the post – and medical certificate 
requires affirmation of the vision standards. Let‟s examine a 
hypothetical situation. No particular reference to any ailment was 
provided in the schedule to the Rules 2013 or Rule 12.16 of the Police 
Rules 1934. Does mere non-mentioning of a particular ailment would 
suggest that any prospective candidate, though suffering from said 
ailment, considered a disability for appointment to government 
service or for that matter police department, which ailment was 
discovered upon conduct of post-approval medical examination, could 
claim entitlement to the appointment on the premise that such ailment 
was not identified in the minimum qualifications. No such restrictive 
or exclusionary interpretation could be attributed to the Rules 2013, 
provided any inconsistency is found. Even otherwise no inconsistency 
could be claimed in the context of vision standards prescribed under 
Notification of 1965. Relevant clause of the Notification is reproduced 
hereunder, 
6. 
Visual Standard 
6.(i) 
……………. 
6.(ii)  Police Department. 
Distant Vision 6/9 in each eye without glasses. Near vision 
as in Civil Service. They should have good muscle-balance, 
visual fields and colour vision, night vision and binocular 
vision”. 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
12
  
If we go by the erred construction of the Rules 2013, proposed 
by learned counsel for respondent, which claimed that requirement(s) 
of “good muscle-balance, visual fields and colour vision, night vision 
and binocular vision” per se stood excluded for being not appearing 
in the schedule to the Rules 2013, and such disabilities, as identified 
in the Notification of 1965, are not attracted. This implies that even a 
person with poor night vision could claim entitlement to enrolment on 
the premise that no particular reference to such defect in the vision 
was found in the advertisement or the Rules 2013. This construction is 
fallacious, even bordering absurdity. We repel the argument that 
identification of bare minimum qualifications in the advertisement and 
non-disclosure of each and every qualification or disqualification in 
the Rules 2013 would imply exclusion of all other conditions, which 
otherwise form part and parcel of requirements for determining 
medical fitness. In essence, conditions, in addition to those minimally 
prescribed in the Rules 2013, are characterized as supplemental or 
incidental conditions and vision standards, provided in the 
Notification of 1965, constitute supplemental / incidental conditions – 
to be read as part and parcel of the Rules 2013 and for that matter 
Rule 12.16 of the Police Rules 1934. In brief, claim of exclusion of 
vision standards in Notification of 1965 manifest erroneous 
construction of Rule 14 of the Rules 2013, when no inconsistency is 
otherwise found. Notably, legality or vires of the Notification of 1965 
was not questioned, either before us or before learned Single Judge-
in-Chambers. In view of aforesaid, we, for the present purposes, hold 
that appointment / enrolment was subject to the declaration of medical 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
13
fitness in terms of Rule 12.16 and appendix thereto and prescribed 
vision standards.  
12. 
Now we address the question of limitation. Record is examined, 
which depicts that appeal against order of 06.12.2021 was initially 
filed on 23.12.2021, wherein various office objections were raised, 
and seven days were allegedly allowed for removal of objections. 
Appeal was re-filed on 27.01.2022, which came up for hearing on 
31.01.2022, not as an objection case but as a normal appeal. Objection 
Form, with endorsement dated 23.12.2021, is examined which 
contained signatures of Assistant Advocate General, Punjab, 
Bahawalpur with endorsement that “objection has been removed”. 
There is no indication regarding the date of return of appeal or time of 
removal of objection, as noted on the Objection Form. It is not 
pleaded that order of office objections were notified on the notice 
board. Be that as it may, if seven days were considered to be granted 
for removal of office objection on 23.12.2021, then same had to be 
removed by 31.12.2021, which cut-off date fell in the midst of Court‟s 
winter vacation. This aspect makes the requirement of notice under 
Rule 9-A, Part A(a), Chapter 1, Volume V of Rules and Orders of the 
Lahore High Court, Lahore extremely essential – if private person is 
held entitled to notice in terms of Rule 9-A, government cannot be 
deprived of this treatment. Apparently, there is no indication of 
issuance of notice or affixation of order of objections on the notice 
board. The necessity of notice / affixation of order of objection was 
discussed and affirmed in various judgments, significance whereof is 
reiterated in the case of Chief Executive, PESCO Department, 
Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar and others V. Afnan 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
14
Khan and another (2021 SCMR 2100). Decision in the case of Asad 
Ali and 9 others V. The Bank of Punjab and others (PLD 2020 
Supreme Court 736) needs consideration, which is found 
distinguishable for reasoning discussed infra. Firstly, significance of 
notice under Rule 9-A was not in issue therein. Secondly, there was 
no plausible explanation qua conspicuous delay of six months. Thirdly, 
facts are distinguishable; instant appeal was filed under the signatures 
of Government Pleader of Punjab and question of ascertaining proper 
authorization otherwise pales into insignificance in wake of non-
compliance of mandate of Rule 9-A. Fourthly, instant appeal was 
taken up for hearing on 31.01.2022, wherein no objection regarding 
limitation was raised before learned Division Bench. However, after 
hearing of the appeal on various dates objection regarding limitation 
was raised on 22.09.2022, and thereafter application under Section 5 
of the Limitation Act, 1908 for condonation of delay was submitted. 
Fifthly question of limitation was not decided by the High Court in 
terms of the facts of the case of Asad Ali (supra) but by the Tribunal 
constituted in terms of the Industrial Relations Act, 2008. Sixthly, it 
was observed, in the case of Asad Ali (supra), that question of 
limitation would finally be examined by the Court/Presiding Officer, 
even if office objections were raised and not removed within the 
allocated time. In the context of absence of any notice in terms of 
Rule 9-A ibid, guidance is solicited from the decisions cited as Mst. 
Sabiran Bi V. Ahmad Khan and another (2000 SCMR 847) and 
Farman Ali V. Muhammad Ishaq and others (PLD 2013 Supreme 
Court 392), which judgments reiterate the necessity and effect of 
failure to notify factum of objections on the notice board. [Decision in 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
15
the case of Farman Ali (supra) was discussed in the case of Afnan 
Khan (supra)]. There is another significantly notable aspect of this 
particular case. No question of accrual of any right of the respondent 
is otherwise involved. Decision in the case of “Province of the 
Punjab, etc. V. Attique Zaidi, etc.” [ICA No.162 of 2015] was not 
brought to the attention of learned Single Judge-in-Chambers, hence, 
judgment subject matter is per incuriam, which was rendered in 
ignorance of previous decision, otherwise having binding effect.  
13. 
In view of the narrative above, we hold that sufficient cause is 
available to condone the delay, if any otherwise occasioned, and we 
observe that failing to exercise jurisdiction in condoning delay would 
otherwise perpetuate an obvious illegality. 
14. 
Case law referred, particularly decision in the case of Satya 
Prakash Vasisht (supra), by Hon‟ble Supreme Court of neighboring 
country, is not attracted, wherein the law existing and applicable 
thereto was interpreted. Controversy involved recapped - Question 
posed is not concerned with the effect of color blindness on the nature 
of duties to be performed and difficulties encountered but whether 
such deficiency constitute medical unfitness for the post advertised, 
wherein scope of duties to be performed was not specifically 
identified and it was not clear that what kind of duties would be 
assigned to the recruit(s), combat or non-combat. We have already 
discussed legislative framework entailing color blindness, for the 
purposes of present matter, as cause for declaring respondent 
medically unfit, in absence of any inconsistency qua vision standards 
prescribed. No inconsistency is found in the minimum qualifications 

ICA No.37/2022 
 
 
16
prescribed in the schedule to Rules 2013 with Rule 12.16 of the Police 
Rules 1934 and vision standards prescribed in Notification of 1965. 
No case for any discrimination or unfairness is made out. Any 
reference to the conditions prescribed by Federal Public Service 
Commission, 
specifically 
providing 
for 
color 
blindness 
as 
disqualification for the purposes of employment in Railways 
department, is not relevant for present purposes. 
15. 
We hold that decision in the case of Attique Zaidi (supra) is a 
good law and judgment impugned hereby is contrary to the ratio 
settled therein, hence judgment impugned is declared illegal and of no 
legal effect. 
16. 
Instant appeal is allowed in aforesaid terms. No order as to 
costs.
