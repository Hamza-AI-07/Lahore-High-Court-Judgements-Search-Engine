3. 
Briefly, the prosecution case as per application (Ex.PB) submitted by 
Abdul Aziz (complainant/PW-2) to Muhammad Akram A.S.I. (PW-11/now 
retired) at Police Station: Theh Sheikhum, is that on 31.05.2018 at 06/07:00 a.m., 
Muhammad Akram brother-in-law (بہنوئی) of the complainant alongwith his

while riding on two motorcycles were coming towards Kasur Court on the date 
of hearing; said Tahira Bibi was sitting on the motorcycle of Muhammad Akram 
and aforestated Shahzad was riding on his own motorcycle; said Muhammad 
Akram was an accused in case titled as “The State versus Muhammad Saleem 
etc.”  whereas Tahira Bibi and Shahzad alongwith Muhammad Akram were 
coming to meet Muhammad Saleem (arrested accused in aforementioned case) 
and after crossing Gaggar Chowk (گگڑ چوک) when they reached at Kasur Road at 
a distance of 3/4 Acre from Gaggar Chowk (
 گگڑ چوک), meanwhile, accused 
persons while riding on motorcycle without registration number driven by Saif 
Ullah accused, arrived there and deboarded Tahira Bibi from motorcycle of 
Muhammad Akram; Muhammad Farooq made straight fireshots in result 
whereof Muhammad Akram after becoming injured fell down on the ground and 
succumbed to the injuries; on raising hue and cry by Tahira Bibi and Muhammad 
Shahzad, Muhammad Farooq pointed his weapon towards them and extended 
threat that if anyone would come forward, he would also be done to death upon 
which aforementioned Shahzad and Tahira Bibi became frightened and stood off 
(دور وہےئگ); accused persons while extending threats fled away from the spot on their 
motorcycle, in the meantime, someone made call to 15 (help line) and subsequently 
police had taken said Muhammad Akram, who died in result of fireshots.  
 
Motive behind the occurrence as per application (Ex.PB) for registration 
of case was pendency of criminal case regarding murder of Amanat Ali (father of 
Saif Ullah and paternal uncle of Muhammad Farooq) against Muhammad Akram 
and his brother Muhammad Saleem, etc.  
 
4. 
On the basis of aforementioned application (Ex.PB), case vide F.I.R.    
No.194/2018 (Ex.PB/2), dated: 31.05.2018 under Sections: 302, 34 PPC was 
registered at Police Station: Theh Sheikhum, District: Kasur.  
 
 
After completion of investigation, challan report under Section: 173 
Cr.P.C. was submitted in the Court; appellant and his co-accused (since 
acquitted) were formally charge sheeted, however, they pleaded not guilty and 
claimed trial whereupon prosecution evidence was summoned; after recording of 
prosecution evidence, accused persons were examined under Section: 342 
Cr.P.C. but they refuted the allegations levelled against them; they did not opt to 
appear as their own witnesses under Section: 340(2) Cr.P.C, however, 
Muhammad Farooq (appellant) produced photocopies of petition u/s 22-A, B 
Cr.P.C. alongwith comments of S.H.O. and order of Court as “Mark-A”, 
photocopy of plaint of civil suit titled as “Muhammad Akram versus Akhtar” 

Criminal Appeal No.23151/2019 & 
Murder Reference No.94/2019

with order of the Court as “Mark-B” whereas Saif Ullah (co-accused) produced 
photocopy of registration of the motorcycle as “Mark-C”, in their defence. 
 
Learned trial court after conclusion of trial while acquitting co-accused 
namely Saif Ullah, has convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned 
above through the impugned judgment dated: 10.04.2019. 
 
5. 
Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that conviction recorded 
and sentence awarded to the appellant through impugned judgment is against 
the ‘law and facts’ of the case; ocular account is neither trustworthy nor 
corroborated/supported by any other evidence. Learned counsel for the 
appellant finally prayed for acquittal of the appellant. 
 
6. 
Conversely, learned Additional Prosecutor General and learned counsel 
for the complainant have supported the impugned judgment to the extent of 
conviction and sentence recorded against Muhammad Farooq (appellant) and 
prayed for dismissal of his appeal.  
 
7. 
Arguments heard.  Record perused. 
 
8.   
It has been noticed that machinery of law was brought into motion by 
Abdul Aziz (complainant/PW-2) through application (Ex.PB) for registration of 
case; it is relevant to mention here that said Abdul Aziz (complainant/PW-2) in his 
examination-in-chief stated that he got scribed application (Ex.PB) at the spot and 
submitted the same to the police; in this regard, relevant portion of his statement is 
hereby reproduced: - 
“I got scribed application Ex.PB at the spot and submitted the same 
to the police. Ex.PB bears my signature as Ex.PB/1.” 
 
during cross-examination, he stated that on the day of occurrence, he did not go to 
the police station and application (Ex.PB) for registration of case was delivered to 
the police at the place of occurrence; relevant portion of his statement in this 
regard is as under: - 
“On the day of occurrence I did not go to the police station. 
Volunteered Ex.PB was delivered to the police at the place of 
occurrence.” 
 
Tahira Bibi (PW-3) categorically stated in her statement before the Court that 
police reached at the spot at about 06:30 a.m. and all proceedings were conducted 
by the police between 06:45/07:00 a.m. approximately; she further deposed that 
Abdul Aziz (complainant/PW-2) submitted application before the police at the 
spot; in this regard, relevant portion of her statement is reproduced: - 
“Complainant Abdul Aziz reached the place of occurrence within a 
span of 10-15 minutes. The police reached the spot at about 6:30 

Criminal Appeal No.23151/2019 & 
Murder Reference No.94/2019  
 
4 
a.m. The police on reaching the spot conducted all the proceedings 
between 6:45/7:00 a.m. approximately. Except the proceedings 
mentioned above, the police did not conduct any other proceedings. 
Two vehicles of police came at the spot alongwith van of police of 
blue colour alongwith 6-7 officials. Abdul Aziz complainant 
remained at the spot till the conclusion of proceedings by the police. 
I do not know who recorded my statement; however he was sitting 
inside the police Dallah vehicle where he recorded my statement. 
Abdul Aziz submitted application before the police at the spot. ” 
 
Similarly, Muhammad Shahzad (PW-4) during his statement before the Court 
stated that complainant reached at the spot prior to arrival of the police; he further 
stated that after receiving application from the complainant, police conducted 
entire proceedings at the spot and police stayed at the spot about 45-minutes to 01-
hour; relevant portion of his statement is reproduced: - 
“The police reached the spot at about 6:48 a.m. First of all Abdul 
Aziz complainant reached the spot to whom I informed him about the 
occurrence. Abdul Aziz reached the spot at about 6:46 a.m. prior to 
arrival of police. I do not know who informed the complainant about 
the occurrence prior to his reaching the spot. I did not inform any 
body about the occurrence prior to arrival of Abdul Aziz 
complainant. I did not inquire from Abdul Aziz complainant how has 
received the information about the occurrence. After receiving the 
application from the complainant, the police conducted the entire 
proceedings at the spot. The police stayed at the spot for about 45 
minutes to one hour. Thereafter we had also gone to our houses.” 
whereas perusal of application (Ex.PB) for registration of case and First 
Information Report (Ex.PB/2) reveals that both said documents do not contain 
receipt of application for registration of case by the police at the spot and then 
transmitting the same to the police station for registration of case; furthermore, 
Muhammad Akram A.S.I. (now retired, who scribed Frist Information Report) 
while appearing as  PW-11 during trial of the case categorically stated that                    
on 31.05.2018, he was posted as A.S.I./Duty Officer at the police station and 
Abdul Aziz (complainant/PW-2) submitted application (Ex.PB) before him and on 
the basis of the same, he drafted First Information Report (Ex.PB/2); he further 
stated that complainant (PW-2) reached at police station at about 07:30 a.m. and at that 
time he was all alone; relevant portion of his statement in this regard is as under: - 
“On 31.05.2018 I was posted as ASI/Duty Officer at PS Theh 
Sheikhum. On the same date, Abdul Aziz complainant submitted 
application Ex.PB before me and on the basis of the same I got 
drafted formal FIR Ex.PB/2 through computer without any addition 
or omission and it bears my signature.” 
 
Aforementioned both stances are contradictory and this mystery that when and 
where application was moved by the complainant for registration of case to the 

Criminal Appeal No.23151/2019 & 
Murder Reference No.94/2019  
 
5 
police either at the place of occurrence or at the police station, could not be 
resolved which raises question mark in this regard. Perusal of application for        
post-mortem examination (Ex.PL) reveals that same was forwarded to C.M.O. at 
03:20 p.m. on 31.05.2018 whereas statement of Dr. Abdul Samad (PW-5) reflects 
that dead body was received in the mortuary at 09:50 a.m. on 31.05.2018, police 
papers were received in the mortuary on 31.05.2018 at 04:00 p.m. and he 
conducted post-mortem examination over dead body of the deceased at 04:20 p.m. 
on the same day; he also categorically stated that due to non-production of relevant 
documents i.e. inquest report, application for autopsy and F.I.R., the post-mortem 
could not be conducted; relevant portion of his statement in this regard is as under:- 
“The dead body was received in the mortuary at 9:50 a.m.                   
on 31.05.2018. Due to non production of documents i.e. inquest 
report, application for autopsy and FIR, the post mortem could not 
be conducted on till 4:00 p.m. on the same date. I received the 
complete documents at 4:00 p.m. and thereafter I conducted the post 
mortem at 4:20 p.m. on the same date.” 
 
Now it is crystal clear that as per own case of the prosecution, dead body of the 
deceased was received in the mortuary at 09:50 a.m. on 31.05.2018 and post-
mortem examination over dead body of the deceased could not be done due to 
non-production of documents i.e. inquest report, application for autopsy and F.I.R. 
rather same was conducted with much delay i.e. 04:20 p.m. As per F.I.R., 
Muhammad Akram (deceased of the case) succumbed to the injuries at the spot 
but question does arise that if case was registered at the claimed time i.e. 07:45 
a.m., then why police papers were not dispatched with dead body which was 
received in the mortuary at 09:50 a.m. and answer is very simple that same were 
not prepared till then; such sort of delay in conducting post-mortem examination 
dislodges promptness of recorded F.I.R. and it reflects that none of the cited 
eyewitnesses was present at the time and place of occurrence and time has been 
consumed for procuring, inducing witnesses and after deliberation and 
consultation concocting story for the prosecution; in this regard, guidance has 
been sought from the dictum laid down by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of “SUFYAN NAWAZ and another versus The STATE 
and others” (2020 SCMR 192), relevant portion from Paragraph No. 4 (Page 
194) is being reproduced: - 
“The unexplained delay of about ten hours in autopsy of Kabeer 
Ahmad (deceased) alone creates dent in the prosecution story so 
far as presence of eye-witnesses at the place of occurrence is 
concerned.” 
 

Criminal Appeal No.23151/2019 & 
Murder Reference No.94/2019  
 
6 
In aforementioned circumstances, it is crystal clear that case was not registered 
at the stated time rather with much delay, however, showing ante time in the 
record; therefore, neither any sanctity nor evidentiary value can be attached to 
said First Information Report and same cannot provide any corroboration to the 
case of prosecution. By now it is well settled that First Information Report lays 
foundation of the criminal case and when it has not been promptly recorded 
rather with delay as stated above and no reasonable explanation regarding its 
delayed recording has come on the record, then it is fatal for the case of 
prosecution. In this regard, guidance has been sought from the case of 
“HAROON SHAFIQUE versus The STATE and others” (2018 SCMR 2118), 
case of “MUHAMMAD RAFIQUE alias FEEQA versus The STATE” (2019 
SCMR 1068), “TARIQ MEHMOOD versus The STATE and others” (2019 
SCMR 1170), “TARIQ ALI SHAH and another versus The STATE and 
others” (2019 SCMR 1391) and “SAFDAR MEHMOOD and others versus 
TANVIR HUSSAIN and others” (2019 SCMR 1978). 
 
   
As far as ocular account in the case is concerned, Abdul Aziz 
(complainant/PW-2) categorically stated in his statement before the Court that 
he was not eyewitness of the occurrence; in this regard, relevant portion of his 
statement is as under:  
“It is correct that I am not an eye witness of this occurrence and my 
statement is based upon the facts told by the PWs and I have deposed 
as narrated by the PWs.”  
 
Meaning thereby that ocular account comprises upon Tahira Bibi (PW-3, sister 
of Muhammad Akram/deceased of the case) and Muhammad Shahzad (PW-4, 
son-in-law of deceased of the case). Admittedly, both said cited eyewitnesses 
are not residents of the place of occurrence, so, they are chance witnesses. It is 
by now well settled that chance witnesses have to plausibly/reasonably explain 
and prove reason of their presence at the “time and place” of occurrence. 
Though in the application (Ex.PB) for registration of case it was got recorded 
by the complainant that on the day of occurrence of this case, both 
aforementioned cited eyewitnesses were accompanying Muhammad Akram 
(deceased of the case) for going to Court in Kasur with respect to date of 
hearing of the case because said Muhammad Akram (deceased of the case) was 
accused in case titled as “The State versus Muhammad Saleem, etc.” whereas 
Tahira Bibi and Muhammad Shehzad (both witnesses mentioned above) had to 
meet Muhammad Saleem (accused arrested in said case) and that’s why they 

Criminal Appeal No.23151/2019 & 
Murder Reference No.94/2019  
 
7 
were coming with Muhammad Akram. Similarly, Tahira Bibi while appearing 
as PW-3 stated that they were coming to Kasur Courts; Shehzad (PW-4) also 
stated that they were coming to Kasur Courts to attend hearing of case against 
Akram (deceased). Therefore, it was mandatory for the prosecution to prove 
that aforestated case was pending before the Courts at Kasur and on that day, 
date of hearing was fixed in said case but attested copy of order sheet, cause list 
or any other document to prove/substantiate said contention/version was not 
produced during trial of the case. Hence, “cause” claimed by the prosecution 
with respect to accompanying aforementioned both cited eyewitnesses with the 
deceased of the case at the “time and place” of occurrence that they were going 
to Kasur Courts in connection with date of hearing in the case, could not be 
established; therefore, their testimonies being “suspect evidence” cannot be 
believed without a pinch of salt; in this regard, guidance has been sought from 
the case of “Mst. SUGHRA BEGUM and another versus QAISER PERVEZ 
and others” (2015 SCMR 1142); relevant portion whereof is reproduced as 
under: - 
“14. A chance witness, in legal parlance is the one who claims that 
he was present on the crime spot at the fateful time, albeit, his 
presence there was a sheer chance as in the ordinary course of 
business, place of residence and normal course of events, he was not 
supposed to be present on the spot but at a place where he resides, 
carries on business or runs day to day life affairs.  It is in this 
context that the testimony of chance witness, ordinarily, is not 
accepted unless justifiable reasons are shown to establish his 
presence at the crime scene at the relevant time.  In normal course, 
the presumption under the law would operate about his absence 
from the crime spot.  True that in rare cases, the testimony of chance 
witness may be relied upon, provided some convincing explanations 
appealing to prudent mind for his presence on the crime spot are put 
forth, when the occurrence took place otherwise, his testimony 
would fall within the category of suspect evidence and cannot be 
accepted without a pinch of salt” 
Guidance can also be sought from the case of “MUHAMMAD AMEER and 
another versus RIYAT KHAN and others” (2016 SCMR 1233); the relevant 
portion whereof is also reproduced: - 
“4. 
As already observed above, one of the eye-witnesses relied 
upon by the prosecution, i.e. Noor Muhammad had not been 
produced by the prosecution before the trial Court and the ocular 
account was furnished in this case only by Ghulam Abbas (PW-9).  
The said witness was a first cousin of Muhammad Afzal deceased 
and was admittedly a chance witness who ordinarily resided about 
one kilometer away from the place of occurrence.  The stated reason 
for availability of this witness near the place of occurrence had 
never been established through any independent evidence at all” 
 
 

Criminal Appeal No.23151/2019 & 
Murder Reference No.94/2019  
 
8 
In this regard, case of “NAVEED ASGHAR and 2 others versus The STATE” 
(PLD 2021 Supreme Court 600), “SUFYAN NAWAZ and another versus The 
STATE and others” (2020 SCMR 192), “Mst. MIR ZALAI versus GHAZI 
KHAN and others” (2020 SCMR 319) can also be referred. Tahira Bibi (PW-3) 
and Muhammad Shahzad (PW-4) both stated that assailant made 4/5 fireshots 
at the deceased of the case but they did not utter even a single word regarding 
locale of receipt of injuries i.e. frontal, posterior, lower or upper part of the 
body; perusal of Column No.8 of the Inquest Report (Ex.PN) reflects that eyes 
and mouth of the deceased were found as “semi opened (قدرے کھال)”. It is most 
relevant to mention here that said state of affairs raises eyebrows regarding 
presence of Tahira Bibi (PW-3) and Muhammad Shahzad (PW-4) at the “time 
and place” of occurrence particularly when they both are closely related to the 
deceased i.e. Tahira Bibi is sister whereas Muhammad Shahzad is son-in-law of 
the deceased; had they been present at the place of occurrence, at the relevant 
time, then they would have definitely closed the eyes and mouth of the 
deceased; while observing so, guidance has been sought from the case of 
“MUHAMMAD ASIF versus The STATE” (2017 SCMR 486). 
 
It is pertinent to mention here that Tahira Bibi (PW-3) introduced 
dishonest improvements in her statement before the Court and same are hereby 
reproduced for ready reference: -  
“I have got recorded in my statement u/s 161 CrPC that at about 
5:00/5:30 am I alongwith my brother proceeded from(confronted 
with ExDA wherein timing is not mentioned). I have got recorded in 
ExDA that Damad of deceased had come out from our 
house(confronted with ExDA wherein it is not so recorded). I have 
also got recorded to the 1.0 in my statement EXDA that we were 
coming to Kasur courts (confronted with ExDA wherein it is 
mentioned that I alongwith Muhammad Akram was coming to Kasur 
courts on two motor cycles). I have also got recorded in ExDA that a 
motor cycle without number came on behind us (confronted with 
ExDA where word 'behind' is not mentioned). I have also got 
mentioned in EXDA that the accused came from the left side from 
our motor cycle and forced us to stop the same; that Akram stopped 
motor cycle; that Farooq accused asked me to alight from the motor 
cycle, so I alighted from it and accused Farooq also asked me to 
keep away(confronted with ExDA wherein it is not so mentioned). 1 
got mentioned in ExDA that accused Farooq was armed with pistol 
30 bore(confronted with ExDA wherein it is not so recorded). I got 
recorded in ExDA that accused Saif Ullah remained present on his 
already started motor cycle, Farooq accused then sat behind 
accused Saif Ullah and then both of them had extended threats of 
murder of us and fled away from the spot confronted with ExDA 
wherein it is not so recorded). I have got recorded before he 1.0 in 
ExDA that after some time, Abdul Aziz complainant came at the spot. 
After a short while police also reached the place of occurrence, 

Criminal Appeal No.23151/2019 & 
Murder Reference No.94/2019  
 
9 
Shahzad PW told the entire occurrence to complainant Abdul Aziz 
(confronted with ExDA wherein it is not so recorded). It is incorrect 
that I have made dishonest improvements in my statement just to 
strengthen the prosecution case.” 
 
Similarly, 
Muhammad 
Shahzad 
(PW-4) 
also 
introduced 
dishonest 
improvements in his statement before the Court, same are also reproduced: -  
 
“I have got recorded in my statement u/s 161 CrPC that at about 
5:00/5:30 am I alongwith my brother proceeded from(confronted 
with ExDB wherein timing is not mentioned), I have got recorded in 
ExDB that Damad of deceased had come out from our 
house(confronted with ExDB wherein it is not so recorded). I have 
also got recorded to the 1.0 in my statement ExDB that we were 
coming to Kasur courts(confronted with ExDB wherein it is 
mentioned that I alongwith Muhammad Akram was coming to Kasur 
courts on two motor cycles). I have also got recorded in ExDB that a 
motor cycle without number came on behind us(confronted with 
ExDB where word 'behind' is not mentioned). I have also got 
mentioned in ExDB that the accused came from the left side from 
our motor cycle and forced us to stop the same; that Akram stopped 
motor cycle; that Farooq accused asked me to alight from the motor 
cycle, so I alighted from it and accused Farooq also asked me to 
keep away(confronted with ExDB wherein it is not so mentioned). I 
got mentioned in ExDB that accused Farooq was armed with pistol 
30 bore(confronted with ExDB wherein it is not so recorded). I got 
recorded in ExDB that accused Saif Ullah remained present on his 
already started motor cycle, Farooq accused then sat behind 
accused Saif Ullah and then both of them had extended threats of 
murder of us and fled away from the spot(confronted with ExDB 
wherein it is not so recorded). 1 have got recorded before he I.O in 
ExDB that after some time, Abdul Aziz complainant came at the spot. 
After a short while police also reached the place of occurrence, I 
had told the entire occurrence to complainant Abdul Aziz 
(confronted with ExDB wherein it is not so recorded). It is incorrect 
that I have made dishonest improvements in my statement just to 
strengthen the prosecution case.” 
 
By now it is also well settled that witness who introduces dishonest 
improvement for strengthening the case, cannot be relied; in this regard, case of 
“MUHAMMAD ARIF versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR 631) and  
“KHALID MEHMOOD and another versus The STATE and others” 
(2021 SCMR 810) can be advantageously referred. It is also relevant to 
mention here that complainant claimed that though he is not eyewitness of the 
occurrence yet he was told about the occurrence by the witnesses, however, 
Tahira Bibi (PW-3) categorically stated that she did not tell the complainant 
about the occurrence and in this regard, relevant portion of her statement is 
hereby reproduced: - 
 
 

Criminal Appeal No.23151/2019 & 
Murder Reference No.94/2019  
 
10
“I do not who informed the complainant Abdul Aziz about the 
occurrence. However, I did not tell to him about the occurrence. 
I also did not inform about the occurrence to any other person. I 
do not know how the police came at the spot and in this regard 
Allah knows better.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  (emphasis added) 
 
As per site plan (Ex.PA available at Page No.150 of the Paper Book) when 
assailant made firearm shots at the deceased, distance between them was           
5-feet meaning thereby that if length of arm of the assailant is subtracted, then 
there should be definitely blackening on the entry wounds received by the 
deceased but the doctor has categorically stated while appearing before the 
Court as PW-5 that there was no blackening in the wounds; relevant portion of 
his statement in this regard is as under: - 
“There was no blackening on the wounds.” 
Though it was claim of the prosecution that cited eyewitness Muhammad 
Shahzad (PW-4) was also accompanying the deceased on the motorcycle but 
neither PW-4 disclosed any registration number, model, company, colour of 
said motorcycle nor produced the same during investigation/during trial of 
the case and it is also important to mention here that even said motorcycle of 
Muhammad Shahzad was not shown in site plan (Ex.PA, available at Page 
No.150 of the Paper Book). Perusal of Inquest Report (Ex.PN) further 
reflects that neither the complainant nor cited eyewitnesses identified the 
dead body of the deceased of the case and in Column No.4 of the Inquest 
Report, names of the persons identifying the dead body of the deceased are 
mentioned as “Nasir and Shafique”; similarly, Inquest Report was neither 
attested by the complainant nor cited eyewitnesses rather same was attested 
by Munir Ahmad and Muhammad Siddique. Nutshell of the above discussion 
is that testimonies of the complainant and aforementioned both cited 
eyewitnesses are neither confidence inspiring nor trustworthy, hence, cannot be 
relied in this case of capital punishment. 
 
As far as recovery of pistol (P-1) from Muhammad Farooq (appellant) is 
concerned, suffice it to say that as per report of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency (Ex.PP available at Page No.20 of the Paper Book), four empties/ 
cartridge cases secured from the place of occurrence, were not found as having 
been fired from said pistol; therefore, said recovery is inconsequential and of 
no help to the case of prosecution.

So far as recovery of motorcycle (P-2) taken into possession by the 
Investigating Officer through recovery memo (Ex.PD) at the alleged 
pointing out of Saif Ullah (co-accused) and statedly used in the occurrence, is 
concerned, suffice it to say that since any model, company, number or colour of 
the motorbike was not given in the First Information Report, therefore, same 
cannot provide any corroboration to the case of prosecution.  
 
As far as medical evidence is concerned, since no locale of injuries was 
mentioned in the ocular account, therefore, medical evidence could not give 
any confirmation to said extent; furthermore, by now law is well settled that 
medical evidence is mere supportive type of evidence; it can tell about locale, 
nature, magnitude of injury and kind of weapon used for causing injury but it 
cannot tell about identity of the assailant who caused the injury; therefore, same is 
also of no help to the prosecution in peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, 
in this regard, case of “SAJJAN SOLANGI versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR 
872) can be safely referred.  
 
  
As far as motive is concerned, when substantive piece of evidence in the 
form of ocular account has been disbelieved, then motive is of no help to the 
case of prosecution as the same loses its significance; furthermore, motive is a 
double edged weapon and in peculiar facts of the case, can be also considered 
as a reason for roping the accused in the case. 
 
9. 
Nutshell of the above discussion is that prosecution has been failed to 
prove its case against the appellant, therefore, there is no need to discuss 
defence version.  
10. 
In view of what has been discussed above, Criminal Appeal 
No.23151/2019 filed by Muhammad Farooq (appellant), is allowed; conviction 
recorded and sentence awarded to the appellant through impugned judgment 
dated: 10.04.2019, are hereby set aside.  Appellant is acquitted of the charge, he 
be released from jail forthwith, if not required in any other case. 
 
11.  
Murder Reference No.94/2019 is answered in negative and death 
sentence awarded to Muhammad Farooq is not confirmed. 
This judgment has been dictated,  
pronounced, prepared and signed 
on 10.01.2023.
