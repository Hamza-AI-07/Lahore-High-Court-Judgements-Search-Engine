Shahid Karim, J:-. This order will decide the instant petition 
and cluster of petitions viz. W.P No.11674 of 2023, W.P 
No.11173 of 2023, W.P No.11675 of 2023, W.P No.11677 of 
2023, W.P No.11857 of 2023, W.P No.12181 of 2023, W.P 
No.12573 of 2023 and W.P No.11673 of 2023 which engage 
a common question of law.  The challenge is to a notification 
dated 15.02.2023 issued by the order of the Governor of 
Punjab pursuant to the decision of the Provincial Cabinet in 
its meeting held on 09.02.2023.  The impugned notification is 
to the following effect:  
  “In pursuance of Provincial Cabinet decision taken in its 
meeting held on 09.02.2023, the earlier Notification of 
Board of Revenue bearing No.2829-2022/5093- DIR 

W.P No.10992 of 2023 
2 
 
(DEV&G), dated 14.10.2022 regarding creation of new 
district Wazirabad in Gujrat Division is hereby suspended 
till the holding of general elections in the Punjab 
Province.” 
2. 
The impugned notification has been issued by the 
Caretaker Cabinet which was put in place after the dissolution 
of the Provincial Assembly of Punjab.  The impugned 
notification suspends and puts on hold the earlier notification 
dated 14.10.2022 which sought to create a new district of 
Wazirabad and which was divided into Tehsils/ Sub-
Divisions specified in column No.1 and revenue estates 
mentioned in column No.3.  The notification of 14.10.2022 
was issued in exercise of the powers conferred upon the 
Governor Punjab under Section 6 of the Punjab Land 
Revenue Act, 1967 and in supersession of all previous 
notifications. 
3. 
These petitions should receive a short shrift and may 
be decided on the short question that revolves around the 
interpretation of section 230 of the Elections Act, 2017 which 
provides that: 
“230. Functions of caretaker Government.— (1) A 
caretaker Government shall— 
(a) perform its functions to attend to day-to-day matters 
which are necessary to run the affairs of the Government; 
(b) assist the Commission to hold elections in accordance 
with law; 
(c) restrict itself to activities that are of routine, non-
controversial and urgent, in the public interest and 
reversible by the future Government elected after the 
elections; and 
 (d) be impartial to every person and political party. 
(2) The caretaker Government shall not— 
 (a) take major policy decisions except on urgent matters; 

W.P No.10992 of 2023 
3 
 
(b) take any decision or make a policy that may have effect 
or pre-empt the exercise of authority by the future elected 
Government; 
(c) enter into major contract or undertaking if it is 
detrimental to public interest; 
(d) enter into major international negotiation with any 
foreign country or international agency or sign or ratify 
any international binding instrument except in an 
exceptional case 
(e) make promotions or major appointments of public 
officials but may make acting or short term appointments in 
public interest; 
(f) transfer public officials unless it is considered expedient 
and after approval of the Commission; and 
 (g) attempt to influence the elections or do or cause to be 
done anything which may, in any manner, influence or 
adversely affect the free and fair elections. 
(3) The Prime Minister, Chief Minister or a Minister or any 
other members of a Caretaker Governments shall, within 
three days from the date of assumption of office, submit to 
the Commission a statement of assets and liabilities 
including assets and liabilities of his spouse and dependent 
children as on the preceding 30th day of June on Form B 
and the Commission shall publish the statement of assets 
and liabilities in the official Gazette. 
(4) In this section, ‘caretaker Government’ means the 
caretaker Federal Government or a caretaker Provincial 
Government. 
4. 
The Caretaker Cabinet was appointed pursuant to 
Article 224 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (the Constitution) for the Province of Punjab 
after the Provincial Assembly was dissolved.  A plethora of 
judgments of the superior courts, inter alia, 2013 SCMR 
1205 define the periphery of powers of the Caretaker Cabinet 
which, in a nub, remains confined to running of day to day 
affairs.  The explicitness of the powers of a Caretaker Cabinet 
has now been enacted in section 230 of the Act, 2017 which 
has been set out above.  As the statutory wording makes clear 
a Caretaker Government shall perform its functions to attend 
to day to day matters which are necessary to run the affairs of 

W.P No.10992 of 2023 
4 
 
the Government and shall assist the Commission to hold 
elections in accordance with law.  Further the Caretaker 
Government shall restrict itself to activities that are of 
routine, non-controversial, urgent and in the public interest.  
Finally the Caretaker Government is obliged to be impartial 
to every person and political party.  By Sub-section (2) of 
Section 230, the Caretaker Government has been restrained 
from taking any major policy decisions except on urgent 
matters or to attempt to influence the elections or do or cause 
to be done anything which may, in any manner, influence or 
adversely affect the free and fair elections. 
5. 
The notification of 14.10.2022 was issued by an 
elected government and created a new district of Wazirabad.  
The said decision could not have been suspended by the 
Caretaker Government as it is tantamount to taking a major 
policy decision on an issue which was not an urgent matter 
within the contemplation of Section 230(2)(a).  It also has the 
unpalatable effect to influence the elections and adversely 
affect the free and fair elections which are to be held for the 
Provincial Assembly of Punjab.  The impugned notification is 
liable to generate controversy and is certainly not an activity 
of a routine nature to be within the competence of the 
Caretaker Government.  It does not spell out any reasonable 
objective which prompted the Caretaker Cabinet to take such 
a decision which is clearly beyond the scope of the armoury 
of powers of the Caretaker Cabinet and casts doubt on the 
purpose for which the decision was taken. 

W.P No.10992 of 2023

6. 
The label ‘care-taker’ merely denotes a cabinet for a 
short duration constituted under peculiar circumstances and to 
fulfil a constitutional mandate.  The distinction between the 
elected cabinet and a caretaker cabinet does not lie in the use 
of powers under the Constitution or the laws but in making 
decisions while using those powers and which must be 
limited to the purpose underlying their establishment.  Thus, 
although Caretaker Cabinets exercise the same range of 
powers, their actions and decisions must comport with and 
not detract from their primary role as tenants of a regime 
infused with the exalted and core ingredients of neutrality and 
impartiality.  So the curtailment by the courts over the years 
is regarding use of powers which has been circumscribed by 
the dicta of our courts and now finds expression in section 
230 of the Act, 2017.  It must be borne in mind that every 
power has legal limits and the powers of a Caretaker Cabinet 
are more limited than an elected cabinet.  Section 230 of the 
Act, 2017 is an expression of the need to fence the decision-
making powers of a Caretaker Cabinet.  This concept is 
wedded to the notion of a Caretaker Cabinet which is obliged 
to act compatibly with the role assigned to it and to remain 
within the confines of its statutory powers. 
7. 
Before I tear myself away, the role of Election 
Commission of Pakistan (ECP) must be flagged.  Clause 3 of 
Article 218 of the Constitution provides that: 
“218(3) It shall be the duty of the Election Commission to 
organize and conduct the election and to make such 
arrangements as are necessary to ensure that the election 

W.P No.10992 of 2023 
6 
 
is conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with 
law, and that corrupt practices are guarded against. 
8. 
Thus, it is the duty of ECP to organize and conduct the 
election and to make such arrangements as are necessary to 
ensure that the election is conducted honestly, justly and 
fairly.  A cumulative reading of Articles 218, 219 and 220 of 
the Constitution read with Section 230 of the Act, 2017 would 
make it abundantly clear that ECP exercises an overarching 
power over a Caretaker Cabinet during the time it is in place 
and whose sole object is to assist ECP to hold elections in 
accordance with law.  There is no other role envisaged by 
either the Constitution or the law to inhere in a Caretaker 
Cabinet and this must be at the heart of any decisions made 
by the Caretaker Cabinet.  It is important for ECP to engage 
proactively with a Caretaker Cabinet to supervise and oversee 
the decision-making process by a Caretaker Cabinet on its 
own volition and without instigation by the superior courts.  
The Constitution vests enormous powers in ECP to do so and 
there is no doubt that under Article 220 of the Constitution it 
is the duty of all executive parties in the Federation and in the 
Provinces to assist ECP in the discharge of its functions.  
Thus, ECP has to keep a close eye on all decisions being 
taken by a Caretaker Cabinet and to correct them if the 
Caretaker Cabinet falls outside its jurisdiction in any manner 
or takes decisions which infringe the mandate of Section 230 
of the Act, 2017.  Increasingly, cases land in this Court’s 
docket that reflect a transgression of powers by the Caretaker 
Cabinet which is impermissible.  ECP must come alive to its 

W.P No.10992 of 2023 
7 
 
duty to rein in the Caretaker Cabinet if it is found to be 
disloyal to its mandate and primary role. 
9. 
In view of the above, these petitions are allowed.  The 
impugned notification dated 15.02.2023 is set aside.
