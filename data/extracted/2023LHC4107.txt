 Through this writ petition, the petitioner has requested for 
information about details of criminal cases and pending 
inquiries against him with further prayer to supply copies of 
said FIRs and inquiries; get the petitioner’s Stress Nuclear 
Sestamibi scan done; provision of well-ventilated vehicle for 
transportation to the concerned Courts and finally that the 
petitioner may not be arrested in unknown criminal cases with 
ensued consequences for grant of opportunity to approach the 
concerned Court, if any cases are found registered. 
 
2. Learned Counsel (s) for the petitioner contend that as a last 
hope they have knocked the door of this Court and invoke the 
extra ordinary jurisdiction under Article 199 (1)(c) of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 which 
authorizes to pass an appropriate order on the application of 
any aggrieved person for enforcement of his fundamental 

       Writ Petition No.45360 of 2023 
 
 
                                     2 
 
 
rights, and the petitioner being in the age of 76 years 
beseeching the grandeur of this Court, as in pain due to tyrant 
act of caretaker government making him prey of political 
victimization. He is being traumatized through registration of 
successive FIRs and once, he succeeds to obtain bail or 
discharge order in any case he is immediately arrested in 
other cases there and then and this trauma is continued for 
the last 1½ months. Learned counsel (s) have submitted in a 
chronological order the facts of petitioner’s arrest, his 
appearance before the Court, grant of bail or discharge order 
and re-arrest soon after every expedition; however, state that 
as per list of cases provided by the respondents, all FIRs 
against the petitioner have almost been exhausted wherein he 
has successfully obtained release orders except in two cases 
i.e., FIR No.5/23 P/S ACE Gujrat and FIR No.1150/2023 P/S 
Ghalib Market, Lahore. Though he had applied for pre-arrest 
bail in case FIR No.1150/2023 P/S Ghalib Market, Lahore but it 
was dismissed due to non-prosecution; therefore, later he 
applied for post arrest bail in such FIR but application was 
dismissed on the stance of police that he is not under arrest in 
such case. They further state that at present petitioner is 
behind the bars in FIR registered at FIA, Lahore but has also 
succeeded to obtain bail in that case wherein his release order 
is being processed through dialogue between concerned Court 
and Superintendent Jail, but petitioner apprehends that the 
moment he comes out of the jail, he would be arrested in FIR 
No. 5/23 ACE, Gujrat and FIR No.1150/2023, P/S Ghalib Market, 
Lahore. Apprehension is further extending to the pending 
inquiries which can be formalized into an FIR at any moment of 
time by Anti-corruption establishment; though he has not been 
associated in such inquiries nor he knows about nature of 
allegations 
therein, 
therefore, 
he 
has 
made 
above 
submissions/prayers mentioned in the opening paragraph of 

       Writ Petition No.45360 of 2023 
 
 
                                     3 
 
 
this Petition. Learned counsel (s) have relied on case titled “Ali 
Muhammad Khan Versus Director Anti-Corruption Mardan and other” 
passed in Writ Petition No.2790-P/2023 by the Peshawar High 
Court, Peshawar whereby an interim restraining order dated 
05.07.2023 has been passed in favour of the petitioner therein, 
as not to arrest him in unknown FIRs. The learned Counsel (s), 
In the meantime, have also placed on record copy of order 
dated 11.05.2023 passed in petition for pre-arrest bail filed by 
the petitioner before the learned ATC, Lahore in case FIR No. 
1150/2023 P/S Ghalib Market, Lahore supra. 
 
3.  On the other hand, Mr. Ghulam Sarwar Nehung, learned 
Additional Advocate General states that every time petitioner 
brings a lis before this Court with one pretext or the other 
without any substantive ground or material. Further states that 
no law prohibits the law enforcement agencies to arrest the 
accused in number of cases one after another and passing of 
omnibus order for not arresting the petitioner in any unknown 
FIRs is without any legal justification.  
 
4. Arguments heard. Record perused.  
 
5. Perusal of report submitted by the Director General Anti-
Corruption Establishment Punjab, Lahore shows that certain 
FIRs are registered and some inquiries are pending against the 
petitioner which are as follows: - 
 

       Writ Petition No.45360 of 2023 
 
 
                                     4 
 
 
 
 
Similarly, Director FIA, Lahore Zone has submitted report that 
the petitioner is involved in following two FIRs: - 
 
 
1. 
FIR No.18/2023 dated 20.06.2023 u/s 161,162 PPC, 
5(2)47 PCA, 5,23 FERA r/w section 3/4 AMLA, PS 
FIA AMLC Lahore; 
 
2. 
FIR No.3/2023 dated 13.02.2023 u/s 3/4 AMLA 
2010, PS FIA AMLC Lahore. 
 
As per report submitted by the AIG/Legal for Inspector General 
of Police Punjab Lahore, the petitioner is involved in case FIR 
No.1150/23 
u/s 
324/353/506-B/440/436/ 
427/212/ 
186/ 
147/148/149 PPC, 7-ATA Police Station Ghalib Market, Lahore. 
 
6.   The petitioner has secured bail or discharge order in all 
cases registered by the Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment 
except in FIR No. 5/23 ACE, Gujrat whereas in two cases of FIA, 
he has also secured bail, yet in one case his release is under 
process. One case behind him is the FIR No.1150/2023 P/S 
Ghalib Market, Lahore in which he earlier approached the Anti-
terrorism Court Lahore but on chase by police in another case 
he could not appear on 11.05.2023 before the Court, therefore, 
his petition for pre-arrest bail was dismissed due to non-
prosecution. Order of Learned Judge Anti-terrorism Court was 
examined which shows that dispensation was sought on 
medical grounds, learned Court though tentatively assessed 
the medical certificate yet neither provided opportunity to 
place on record the proof in respect of such contention nor 
summoned the accused. Learned Additional Advocate General 
says that there is no law for summoning of accused on the eve 
of his absence in above proceedings, and petitioner was not 
under arrest on the day when he absented himself from the 
Court; therefore, cannot be considered as in captivity. It is not 
necessary that one must be in the captivity to define it as in 

       Writ Petition No.45360 of 2023 
 
 
                                     5 
 
 
custody, rather restriction on his freedom of movement due to 
fear of arrest or threat to life amounts to, as in the custody. 
Full Bench of this Court in a case reported as “SHABBIR AHMAD 
versus THE STATE”  (PLD 1981 Lahore 599) explains this term with 
following expression; 
 
“I would like to explain here the word `custody'. It should not 
be construed as physical custody. If a person is in restraint or 
he apprehends arrest in a case which is cognizable obviously 
his custody is intended by the Police Officer who can arrest 
him without warrant.” 
 
 
Therefore, when one cannot reach to the Court due to fear of 
arrest, his absence be given an opportunity for an explanation 
particularly in sheer or extreme cases of real exigency. The 
opportunity for explanation has been focused in cited case in 
following terms; 
 
 
“The absence of the accused for a genuine cause has to be 
taken into consideration by the Court and it should not take 
hasty steps without affording a reasonable opportunity of 
showing cause for his absence.” 
 
 
Similar view was expounded by the Supreme Court in a case 
reported as “SHAHZAIB and others Versus The STATE” (PLD 2021 
Supreme Court 886) which is as follows; 
 
“However, in case some explanation is furnished for his 
nonappearance, the Court may, if it finds that explanation to 
be satisfactory, exempt his presence for that day and adjourn 
the hearing of the petition for a short period.” 
 
Even if the accused is arrested in another case when he was 
on interim pre-arrest bail in one case, his petition should not 
be dismissed due to want of appearance rather a direction be 
passed for his production before the Court as held by this 
Court in a case reported as “FARHAN MASOOD KHAN versus STATE 
etc.” (PLJ 2021 Cr.C. (Lahore) 550); therefore, contention of 
learned Additional Advocate General is without any legal force, 

       Writ Petition No.45360 of 2023 
 
 
                                     6 
 
 
and learned ATC, Lahore had also lost sight of above dictum of 
the Superior Courts. 
 
7.   The practice of police to arrest the accused intermittently 
at their wish in different cases one after another for 
conducting investigation separately amounts to denial of 
fundamental rights to life and liberty. It has also taken notice 
of Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan and expressed 
serious concerns in a case reported as “GOVERNMENT OF SINDH 
through The Chief Secretary, Karachi and 4 others versus RAEESA 
FAROOQ and 5 others” (1994 SCMR 1283); it dictates that when 
action of law enforcement agencies by their act seems 
malafide, High Court must come into the rescue of an 
aggrieved person; such dictates of Hon’ble Supreme Court is 
cited as follows;  
 
“Where the action and proceedings are not bona fide and with 
ulterior motive to obtain information about an absconding 
accused and arrest after arrest is made involving same 
person in different blind reports lodged much earlier and no 
explanation is provided for such series of actions in seriatum 
one after the other, the High Court is empowered to afford 
protection to the citizen against frivolous and mala fide 
actions by imposing conditions on the erring authorities and 
agencies.”  
 
The High Court under Article 199(1)(c) of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is competent to pass 
appropriate orders on the application of any aggrieved person 
yet this appropriation must not violate any provision of law. 
However, when there is no express provision in the context of 
remedy sought for or which could cater to a situation as the 
justice demands then the Court can exercise powers ex debito 
Justitiae and can grant a relief not specifically prohibited by 
law; reliance is on case reported as “Mian MUHAMMAD NAWAZ 
SHARIF versus PRESIDENT OF PAKISTAN and other” (PLD 1993 
Supreme Court 473). Ex debito Justitiae means “of or by 
reason of an obligation of justice” and it commands that the 

       Writ Petition No.45360 of 2023 
 
 
                                     7 
 
 
way of justice is paved with truth (Justitiae via strata veritate). 
This court in a case reported as “MUHAMMAD NAEEM versus THE 
STATE”  (1980 P Cr. L J 377) (Lahore) while exercising powers 
ex debito justitiae granted interim bail to the accused and held 
that this power can be invoked under Article 203 of the 
Constitution.  
 
8.  In a case reported as “Mst. RAZIA PERVAIZ and another versus 
THE SENIOR SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE, MULTAN and 5 others”   
(1992 P Cr. L J 131), this Court has embarked upon the practice 
of police to arrest the accused in more than one cases one 
after another and declared as under; 
 
“Before parting with the judgment, I feel constrained to 
observe that the provisions of section 54, Cr.P.C. relating to 
the arrest of the accused by the police and the provisions of 
section 167, Cr.P.C. pertaining to the remand of the accused 
person to police custody have been misused and old 
unwarranted police tactics of arresting the accused person 
repeatedly in more than one cases, have been played in the 
instant case, although the law does not authorise the police 
to arrest an accused required in more than one cases, in one 
case and to wait for his arrest in the other case till the expiry 
of the period of remand under section 167, Cr.P.C. or till he is 
released on bail in the first case. This commonly committed 
mischief not only defeats the object of section 167, Cr.P.C. of 
limiting the period of physical detention of an accused person 
to fifteen days but is obviously a joke with the powers of the 
Magistrate in the matter of remand and custody of an accused 
person.” 
                                                               
 
     (Emphasis supplied) 
                                                                                            
The matter of blind FIRs was also subject of a case reported as 
“JAM SAQI Versus PROVINCE OF SINDH through Secretary, Home 
Department, Karachi and 6 others” (2005 P Cr.L.J 1626) wherein the 
Hon’ble Division Bench has observed that If an action is taken 
with malafide intention then the powers exercised by the State 
functionaries cannot be treated as the powers they can 
exercise with bonafide intentions in ordinary course of law. 
The Division Bench finally directed in following terms; 
 
 
“We direct that the entire police administration in the whole of 
Province of Sindh shall not arrest the petitioners and Mst. 
Akhtar Sultana in any blind FIR or in any FIR which is pending 

       Writ Petition No.45360 of 2023 
 
 
                                     8 
 
 
for more than one year against the petitioners and Mst. 
Akhtar Sultana until and unless the necessary particulars of 
FIR are placed before this Court and appropriate orders are 
sought from this Court.” 
 
 
Almost a similar view was already in place which was 
reported through case titled as “Maulana ABDUS SATTAR KHAN 
NIAZI versus THE STATE” (PLD 1974 Lahore 324); the case deals 
with an injunctive order, as not to arrest the petitioner in 
unknown cases; which High Court declared can be passed 
under Article 102 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1962. In the 
recent case “Ali Muhammad Khan Versus Director Anti-
Corruption Mardan and other” passed in Writ Petition No.2790-
P/2023 by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar, an interim 
injunctive order was passed as not to arrest the petitioner 
therein in unknown FIRs.   
  
9.   The uncalled practice for arrest after arrest cannot be 
weighed in the light of object of law enforcement agencies, 
rather from the actions which speak intentions, alive in this 
case, and many others, they were so prompt and swift so as to 
leave desperation as foot prints in the book of history. Without 
collecting proper information and sufficient material rushing 
for an arrest stands in complete negation of dictum of 
Honourable Supreme Court in a case reported as “Mst. 
SUGHRAN BIBI versus The STATE” (PLD 2018 Supreme Court 595) 
which otherwise is binding on every organ of the State as per 
Article 189 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973. Any deflection of such dictum in the given 
situation amounts to a malafide action couched in ulterior 
motives for keeping the petitioner behind the bars at every 
cost. The Honourable Supreme Court in supra case 
Government of Sindh etc. versus Raesa Farooq (1994 SCMR 
1283) regarded that such like actions of police are for extorting 
confession or information from accused through ulterior 

       Writ Petition No.45360 of 2023 
 
 
                                     9 
 
 
motives. Such practice is a source of nuisance and causes 
harm to mind and reputation of a person which in turn is 
synonymous to causing hurt; according to section 332 PPC hurt 
includes injury, and injury defined in section 44 PPC means 
“any harm whatever illegally caused to person, in body, mind, 
reputation or property”. Therefore, causing injury for extorting 
information or confession is an offence u/s 337-K PPC which is 
reproduced for reference; 
 
337K. Causing hurt to extort confession, or to compel 
restoration of property: Whoever causes hurt for the 
purpose of extorting from the sufferer or any person 
interested in the sufferer any confession or any information 
which may lead to the detection of any offence or misconduct, 
or for the purpose of constraining the sufferer, or any person 
interested in the sufferer, to restore, or to cause the 
restoration of, any property or valuable security or to satisfy 
any claim or demand, or to give information which may lead 
to the restoration of any property, or valuable security shall, 
in addition to the punishment of qisas, arsh or daman, as the 
case may be, provided for the kind of hurt caused, be 
punished, having regard to the nature of the hurt caused, with 
imprisonment of either description for a term which may 
extend to ten years as ta'zir. 
                                                                                        (Emphasis supplied) 
 
Putting somebody in captivity with threatened incarceration, of 
course indicate design either to obtain required information or 
to secure forced confession of alleged or supposed crime. 
People resist against injustice with inner strength both 
physical and mental but are prone to rely on support from 
outside world like friends, relatives, colleagues, community or 
general masses; therefore, captivity, particularly illegal,  
disconnects the person from outside world and breaks him 
down so badly as to accept everything before him to avoid 
danger to his health, mind, property and most of all the family. 
Producing such effects amounts to commission of offence u/s 
337K of PPC which is a cognizable offence; therefore, arrest 
after arrest also falls in the same category.    
 

       Writ Petition No.45360 of 2023 
 
 
                                     10 
 
 
10.   In the light of above discussion, it can be said that in this 
digital age when sharing information is so simple and cheap, 
its dissemination has become so rapid and effective either 
through social media account or online information available at 
respective Police Information System Software, the record of 
criminal cases of an accused can be obtained easily. Even 
otherwise, a Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) is in existence  
whose primary duty is collection of information relating to 
investigation of every case registered in the district that does 
include information of arrest as per Rule 21.35 of Police Rules, 
1934 and it also talks about arrest of accused in all cases and 
not in one. On receiving an information of arrest of an accused 
CIA is duty bound to inform the Incharge Police Station about 
any other cases registered against him in the district; 
therefore, Station house officer can also develop contact with 
CIA of other districts or provinces so as to collect information 
about number of cases registered against him throughout the 
country. Therefore, once an accused is arrested, he can be put 
into investigation for all cases registered against him and if the 
investigation cannot be completed within stipulated period 
during a physical remand, it can well be continued during 
judicial custody of accused in the jail with all just legal 
exceptions, of course with the permission of concerned 
Magistrate; therefore, arrest after arrest or successive 
remands in different cases amounts to denial of fundamental 
rights to life and liberty and also opposes to principle of due 
process. It is held that if it spurs out from the record that 
arrest in different cases is not being sought for the purpose of 
investigation but to keep the accused in physical custody of 
law enforcement agency for a longer period in order to kneel 
down him to their terms, then it is not only illegal but an 
offence, and bona fide of police for arrest in different cases is 

       Writ Petition No.45360 of 2023 
 
 
                                     11 
 
 
reflected if they put remand request with criminal record of 
accused. 
 
11.   It is trite that section 54 of Cr.P.C. empowers the police to 
arrest without a warrant any person required in nine situations 
mentioned therein but it is only permissible and cannot be 
used as substitute of might is right, therefore, for effecting 
arrest, a warrant should be obtained and as per section 75 (2) 
of Cr.P.C. it remains operative until executed or cancelled by 
the Magistrate/Court concerned. therefore, whenever any 
arrest is required, law enforcement agencies are duty bound to 
submit information of all cases in which the arrest of accused 
is being sought. This command of law in fact provides 
opportunity to ensure the compliance of dictum laid down by 
Honourable Supreme Court in “Sughran Bibi Case” supra for 
collection of sufficient material before making arrest. The 
concerned 
Magistrate/Court 
are 
the 
Guardian 
of 
the 
Constitution and shall accord permission to arrest only if it 
does not oppose to fundamental right to ‘safeguards as to 
arrest and detention’ as enshrined in Article-10 of the 
Constitution. The request of police must be supplemented by 
an opinion of concerned prosecutor so as to convince the 
Magistrate/Court that material is or isn’t available to give a go 
to the request of police. Mentioning the criminal antecedents of 
an accused in a request of remand helps the police to obtain 
physical custody and also resist bail there or at subsequent 
stage because maintaining criminal history is one of the 
grounds to decline bail to the accused, as being hardened or 
dangerous, in order to avoid repetition of the offence; 
therefore, 
non-mentioning 
of 
record 
sometimes 
gives 
premium to accused to seek bail successfully, that irks the 
police to obtain successive remands.

12.   So far as the request of learned counsel (s) for the 
petitioner  that the protective bail may be granted in remaining 
two cases i.e., FIR No. 5/23 P/S ACE, Gujrat and FIR No. 
1150/2023 P/S Ghalib Market, Lahore. which was seriously 
opposed by the learned Additional Advocate General that 
petitioner is not before the court therefore, he cannot be 
granted protective bail which was responded by the other side 
that the petitioner being in jail is in the notice of Court, 
therefore, he can be summoned before this court or he can be 
treated like an accused who applies bail for landing into the 
country in order to surrender before the Court of law and 
Court usually grants such opportunity as held in case reported 
as “SHARJEEL INAM Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others” 
(2017 YLR 2423). The request of learned counsel (s) for the 
petitioner is acceded to, petitioner is granted protective pre-
arrest bail for approaching to the Court concerned within 10 
days after his release from the jail. Earlier the petition for pre-
arrest bail of the petitioner in case FIR No. 1150/2023 P/S 
Ghalib Market, Lahore was dismissed due to non-prosecution; 
though as per ratio in above Case laws the petition should be 
considered as pending but as said order of dismissal has not 
been challenged, therefore, while relying on case laws cited 
above, it is directed that petitioner shall not be arrested in 
case FIR No. 1150/2023 P/S Ghalib Market, Lahore who shall 
approach the concerned Court with a fresh application within a 
period cited above which shall be decided in accordance with 
law. The petitioner shall submit personal surety bond in the 
sum of Rs.50,000/- each in above FIRs, for the satisfaction of 
Deputy Registrar (Judl.) of this Court.  
13.    The net result of above discussion is that this writ petition 
is allowed in the above terms with the direction that petitioner 
shall not be arrested in any blind or unknown FIRs or in 
pending inquiries which shall be completed after providing

forwarded to the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) for
