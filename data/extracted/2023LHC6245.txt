Rasaal Hasan Syed, J. This judgment will dispose of 
the above titled civil revision as well as C.R. No.75701 of 
2022 titled Robina Kausar v. Umar Majeeb Shami as both 
arise from a consolidated judgment of the trial court as well as 
the appellate court in two cross appeals. 
2. 
Petitioner/plaintiff filed a suit for specific performance 
to enforce an agreement of sale dated 17.3.2004 against the 
respondent/defendant which was contested by the respondent. 
The relief of specific performance was declined by learned 
Civil Judge on the ground of limitation while the earnest 
money was directed to be returned. In cross appeals filed by 
the petitioner and respondent, the judgment of the trial court to 
the extent of refusal of grant of specific performance was 
affirmed while the decree for the return of earnest money was 
set aside. In the two revision petitions petitioner/plaintiff has 
assailed judgments/decree of the courts below.

3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the 
agreement of sale was admitted; that the suit filed by the 
petitioner for specific performance of agreement was wrongly 
dismissed on the ground of limitation and it was not 
appreciated that suit was within time from the date of notice of 
refusal to perform the contract and that for  limitation purposes 
second part of Article 113 of Limitation Act, 1908 (the “Act”) 
was applicable and further that the view taken by the courts 
below that the limitation was to be regulated by the first part of 
Article 113 of the Act was against the law and that the 
respondent having taken the plea of return of earnest money 
but failed to prove the same, the petitioner was entitled to the 
grant of relief of specific performance of agreement or in the 
alternative for the return of earnest money with profit. It was 
further submitted that the courts below illegally dismissed the 
suit for specific performance on the plea of limitation and that 
the learned Addl. District Judge erred in law in modifying the 
decree by declining even the return of earnest money. It is 
added that the evidence of P.W.1 was not properly construed, 
nor were the documents produced in evidence correctly 
interpreted or analyzed by the appellate court and that the 
findings rested on misreading and non-reading of record.  
4. 
Learned counsel for the respondent contended that 
specific date was fixed in the agreement for the performance of 
recorded obligation; that limitation for the purposes of suing 

C.R. No.75693 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
Page-3 
 
 
was regulated by the first part of Article 113 of the Act which 
was correctly applied by the courts below; that the suit having 
been filed beyond the period of limitation was rightly 
dismissed on the ground of limitation and that the alternative 
relief for return of money being barred by time suit having 
been filed after three years the appellate court justifiably 
interfered in the judgment of the trial court and, by rectifying 
the error, duly modified the decree and ordered dismissal of 
suit as a whole on the basis of limitation and that the suit 
having been filed beyond limitation no question of allowing 
relief of specific performance arose. With such arguments it 
was submitted that the claim was rightly declined by the courts 
below. 
5. 
Points raised pro and contra have been carefully 
examined in the light of the evidence. Facts, as will be relevant 
for disposal of the case, are that on 23.4.2016 the petitioner 
brought a suit for specific performance titled Mst. Rubina 
Kausar v. Umer Mujeeb Shami claiming that on 17.3.2004 the 
respondent executed an agreement of sale in respect of suit 
property in favour of the petitioner. It was averred that sale 
price 
was 
fixed 
at 
Rs.30,000,000/- 
out 
of 
which 
Rs.15,000,000/- was paid as earnest money. Assertedly the sale 
deed could not be executed due to respondent’s failure to fulfill 
the obligation within the agreed time and that extensions in 
time for completion of transaction were made due to this. It 

C.R. No.75693 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
Page-4 
 
 
was disclosed that the petitioner instituted a suit for specific 
performance on 27.6.2014, however, the respondent on coming 
to know of the civil suit contacted the petitioner through some 
respectables and requested her to abstain from pursuing the 
path of litigation and that he will do his best to complete the 
execution of sale deed without seeking any further extension. 
The petitioner could not convey the instructions to her counsel 
in this regard and in view thereof suit was dismissed for non-
prosecution on 10.3.2015. Afterwards the respondent did not 
perform his part, instead the petitioner statedly learnt that the 
property was being sold elsewhere, which prompted the 
present/second suit for enforcement of the sale agreement.  
6. 
 Respondent/defendant contested the suit both on legal 
as well as factual premises, challenged its tenability on account 
of limitation and also asserted that he always remained ready 
and willing to perform his part, but the agreement could not be 
completed 
because 
of 
non-performance 
on 
part 
of 
petitioner/plaintiff which, in consequence, stood rescinded. It 
was claimed that the amount of Rs.15,000,000/- had already 
been returned and that the belated suit was brought to 
blackmail the respondent after a decade. Issues were framed 
and parties were asked to produce their evidence. Petitioner 
appeared as P.W.1 and produced documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P18  
in support of her claim while  the respondent could not produce 
any evidence as his right of defense was struck off vide order 

C.R. No.75693 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
Page-5 
 
 
dated 24.1.2020 due to non-compliance of order of the court on 
miscellaneous application for producing of documents.  
7. 
Learned Civil Judge after considering the entire 
evidence, oral as well as documentary, dismissed the suit to the 
extent of relief of specific performance as being time-barred 
but at the same time directed the respondent to return 
Rs.15,000,000/- to the petitioner without recording any reasons 
therefor. Both the parties preferred appeal against this decision. 
Petitioner filed civil appeal No.12/2022 titled Rubina Kausar v. 
Umer Majeeb Shami to challenge the decree to the extent of 
refusal to grant relief of specific performance of the agreement 
while the respondent filed civil appeal No. 6560 of 2021 titled 
Umer Majeeb Shami v. Rubina Kausar impugning the 
judgment to the extent of the direction for return of earnest 
money. The appeal of the petitioner was dismissed. That of the 
respondent was allowed.  
8. 
Decree of the trial court resultantly to the extent of 
declining relief of specific performance was affirmed and the 
judgment of the trial court to the extent of direction for return 
of earnest money was set aside. As such, the suit for specific 
performance was dismissed in toto. Aggrieved of decision in 
the two appeals the petitioner has brought the present revision 
petitions. 
9. 
Questions presented for consideration of this Court are 
as to whether the suit was barred by time and was rightly 

C.R. No.75693 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
Page-6 
 
 
dismissed by the court below; whether in view of dismissal of 
suit on account of limitation the order of return of earnest 
money amounted to an untenable contradiction in terms; and as 
to whether the petitioner was entitled, in obtaining facts, to the 
grant of decree of specific performance.  
10. 
Agreement to sell dated 17.3.2004 Ex.P1 provided for 
six months to complete the transaction. Ex.P2 dated 03.9.2005 
extended the period till 30.3.2005. Time was further extended 
for completion of sale vide extension document dated 
22.3.2005 Ex.P3 till 30.9.2005. Further extension was allowed 
vide Ex.P4 dated 23.8.2005 till 31.3.2006 which was followed 
by extension document dated 04.3.2006 Ex.P5 taking this 
period to 31.3.2007. Afterwards, by Ex.P6 it was extended to 
31.3.2008 and finally vide extension Ex.P7 dated 31.8.2008 the 
period was extended for completion of the transaction till 
31.3.2009. Petitioner asserted that all these extensions were 
made because of the respondent but the documents referred 
supra do not support such depiction. Scrutiny of the documents 
rather reflects that the extensions were made with the “consent 
of parties”. Chapter VI of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
relates to exclusion of oral by documentary evidence. Article 
102 provides that where the terms of a contract, or a grant, or 
of any other disposition of property, have been reduced to the 
form of a document, and in all cases in which any matter is 
required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, no 

C.R. No.75693 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
Page-7 
 
 
evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such contract, 
grant or other disposition of property, or of such matter, except 
the document itself, or secondary evidence of its contents in 
cases in which secondary evidence, upon satisfaction of 
conditions prescribed, is admissible. Likewise, Article 103 
provides that where the terms of a contract are in writing and 
proved according to the mode provided no evidence of any oral 
agreement or statement shall be admitted as between the parties 
to any such instrument or their representatives-in-interest, for 
the purposes of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting 
from, its terms.  
11. 
Perusal of the documents shows that consistent conduct 
of the parties was that the extensions, whenever made, were in 
writing. Ex.P2 to Ex.P7 belie the stance of the petitioner that 
the agreement was extended from time to time because of the 
fault of the respondent. Rather the documents show that every 
extension was with mutual consent and no specific burden was 
attributed to either party. In the given circumstances it was a 
case where the agreement provided for a specific date, month 
and year for the completion of the deal under the agreement 
with the last extension of 31.3.2009 serving as final cut-off 
date.  
12. 
Article 113  of the Act provides that for the purposes of 
specific performance of a contract limitation shall commence 
where the date is fixed for the performance from that date, or, 

C.R. No.75693 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
Page-8 
 
 
if no such date is fixed,  when the plaintiff has notice that 
performance is refused. Bare reading of the documents Ex.P2 
to Ex.P7 which are being enforced in the suit reveals that a 
specific date for the performance of contract was given and the 
last being Ex.P7 provided for the performance till 31.3.2009 
which obviously would fall in the first part of Article 113 of 
the Act providing for three years of limitation to sue for 
specific performance from the date fixed in the agreement. In 
the instant case the suit was instituted on 23.4.2016 i.e. over 
seven years from the date fixed in the last-mentioned document 
Ex.P7. 
13. 
Another aspect of the case is that the petitioner earlier 
filed civil suit No. 22682/C dated 27.6.2014 for specific 
performance of the agreement of sale Ex.P1 which was 
dismissed for non-prosecution on 22.7.2014. No effort was 
claimed to have been made for its restoration. In the plaint of 
the said suit Ex.D1 it is stated in paragraph 14 that “now in 
June 2014 the plaintiff came back to Pakistan and on 
20.6.2014 the plaintiff alongwith respectable (1) Muhammad 
Khaliq son of Asghar Ali and (2) Ubaid-ur-Rehman son of 
Rauf Qadeer approached the defendant and requested him to 
transfer the suit property in favour of the plaintiff firstly the 
defendant delayed the matter on lame excuses then he flatly 
refused to transfer the suit property in favour of the plaintiff 
and extended threats that if the plaintiff again contacted him he 

C.R. No.75693 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
Page-9 
 
 
will murdered (sic) the plaintiff…”. In paragraph 17 of Ex.D1 
it was asserted that “the cause of action arose to the plaintiff 
and against the defendant on 17.3.2004 when the agreement 
between the plaintiff and defendant was executed. The cause of 
action further arose at every occasion when the agreement of 
sale was extended and lastly on 20.6.2014 when the defendant 
flatly refused to transfer the property in favour of the plaintiff 
and extended threats of dire consequences and the cause of 
action is still occurring…”. Instead of seeking restoration of 
the suit the petitioner waited for two years and brought the 
second and present suit on 23.4.2016 out of which instant 
revisions stem. The fate of the suit ended in dismissal for non-
prosecution vide order dated 10.3.2015. However, no evidence 
was produced in support of assertion of alleged oral extension 
in time, except the petitioner’s own statement. The statement of 
the petitioner in this regard is also contradictory and otherwise 
not supported by record as the order of the learned Civil Judge, 
dismissing the suit for non-prosecution, simply shows that no 
one appeared from the side of the petitioner to pursue the case 
resulting in its dismissal for non-prosecution.  
14. 
Neither did the petitioner produce any evidence of oral 
understanding to withdraw the suit nor did the counsel file 
affidavit in support thereof. Obviously, the story being 
contradictory to the order-sheet, was inadmissible. Petitioner 
attempted to claim that after the withdrawal of the suit, she 

C.R. No.75693 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
Page-10 
 
 
observed that the property was being alienated by the 
respondent. This alarmed her and that she filed a suit on the 
assumption that it was notice to refuse performance of the 
contract, therefore, according to petitioner the suit was within 
time. The plea raised was totally misconceived, against the 
terms of the agreement and otherwise not proved by any 
corroborative evidence. Rather the agreement Ex.P1 and 
supplementary extension Ex.P2 to Ex.P7 clearly mentioned a 
fixed date for the performance of agreement and there were no 
ifs and buts in this regard. The date was not subjected to 
clearance of any bar of title of the respondent nor was there 
any injunctive order against completion of the deal. The 
petitioner sought enforcement of the agreement with the stance 
that respondent was owner of the property and could transfer 
the same. In the given circumstances the suit was to be 
regulated by the first part of Article 113 of the Act for 
limitation purposes.  
15. 
In Muhammad Sadiq and others v. Muhammad Mansha 
and others (PLD 2018 SC 692) it was observed to the effect 
that existence of a mortgage qua the property subject-matter of 
sale has no bearing on the question of limitation for specific 
performance of agreement to sell which proceed independently 
and on its own footing, therefore, limitation in suchlike cases 
would begin to run from the date recorded in the agreement as 
prescribed by the first limb of Article 113 of the Act. 

C.R. No.75693 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
Page-11 
 
 
Reference can also be made to the case of Haji Abdul Karim 
and others v. Messrs Florida Builders (Pvt) Limited (PLD 
2012 SC 247) where it was observed to the effect that cases 
falling in the ambit of first part of Article 113 of the Act could 
not be considered on the touchstone of the second part for both 
being independent were meant to cater for two different type of 
suits for specific performance in relation to limitation and that 
limitation is a command of law prescribing statutory period 
within which the right is to be exercised and enforced as such 
the courts would have no lawful authority to ignore the 
date/period stipulated in contract which as a legal consequence 
is meant to regulate the period of limitation in terms of first 
part of Article 113 of the Act and that no exemption qua the 
period of limitation could be claimed in law by a party on 
account of pending litigation simpliciter in the absence of an 
order of competent court preventing such party from suing.       
16. 
 In view of the rule supra, the limitation in the instant 
case was to be regulated by the first part of Article 113 of the 
Act which provides for a period of three years from the date 
fixed in the agreement for performance of the obligation. As 
per Ex.P7 the last extension was till 31.3.2009. The suit having 
been filed on 23.4.2016 was on the face of it barred by 
limitation as having been filed after more than three years. So 
much so that the previous suit Ex.D1 which was dismissed for 
non-prosecution and was never restored, was also barred by 

C.R. No.75693 of 2022 
 
 
 
 
Page-12 
 
 
limitation, as it was filed on 27.6.2014 after more than three 
years. The findings of the courts below on the question of 
limitation being in accordance with law, are affirmed. As to the 
claim of the petitioner for specific performance of agreement, 
it was rightly declined as the suit was barred by time. The 
courts below were obligated to dismiss the same as barred by 
limitation and were not required to discuss the issue as to 
specific performance on merits. The concurrent findings in this 
regard do not call for interference.     
17. 
In so far as the argument that the respondent having not 
proved the return of earnest money petitioner should have been 
allowed the return of the earnest money, suffice it to observe 
that the main relief of enforcement of agreement having been 
declined, because of bar of limitation with respect to the suit 
for specific performance or alternatively for the return of 
earnest money, the same could have been instituted within 
three years from the fixed date. This not having been done, 
both reliefs could not be allowed and were rightly so declined. 
The argument that the court in equitable jurisdiction could 
order the return of earnest money is without substance. Of 
course, the court could have allowed the return of money 
provided the suit itself was not barred by time and having 
recorded the findings concurrently that the suit was not within 
time and was filed after more than three years after the expiry 
of limitation, the petitioner was not entitled to any such relief.

View taken by the courts below, being in accordance with law, 
does not call for interference.    
18. 
For the reasons supra, there is no merit in these revision 
petitions, which are dismissed.
