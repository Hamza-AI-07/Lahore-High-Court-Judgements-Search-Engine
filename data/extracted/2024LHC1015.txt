Date of Hearing: 
28.02.2024  
Petitioner by: 
Malik Muhammad Akbar Bhutta, 
Advocate along with the petitioner.   
Respondent by: 
Mr. Muhammad Mehrban Ranjha, 
Advocate along with the respondent.  
Applicant in C.M. 
No.2833/2022 by: 
Dr. Ashraf Ali Qureshi, Advocate. 
 
      Anwaar Hussain, J.  This civil revision is directed against the 
judgment and decree dated 03.03.2022 whereby the appeal of the 
respondent was accepted, order and decree dated 20.10.2021 passed by 
the Trial Court was set aside and the suit of the respondent instituted for 
specific performance of the contract, based on an agreement to sell dated 
29.01.2019 (“the agreement”), was decreed. An application bearing C.M. 
No.2833/2022 has been filed by one Daniyal Zarar Khan s/o Zarar 
Hameed Khan who has purchased the suit property from the petitioner, 
when the suit of the respondent was dismissed and the appeal was not 
preferred, however, the limitation period for preferring appeal was yet to 
expire. Through this judgment, the said application is also being decided.  
2.  
Malik Muhammad Akbar Bhutta, Advocate, learned counsel for 
the petitioner submits that the findings of the Courts below are at variance 
and the impugned judgment and decree passed by the Appellate Court is 
not only arbitrary but also runs counter to the law as to manifestation of 

C.R. No.323/2022  
 
2 
 
 
willingness and readiness on the part of the vendee of an agreement to 
sell. Adds that the respondent is a practicing advocate who has dragged 
the petitioner in unnecessary litigation after tying down the property of 
the petitioner through the agreement and obtaining the interim relief as the 
respondent had no financial means to pay the balance amount of the 
consideration in terms of the agreement, within the cut-off date, as despite 
availing number of opportunities, the respondent failed to deposit the 
balance consideration amount to the tune of Rs.3,500,000/-. Further 
contends that the Appellate Court below has erred in decreeing the suit of 
the respondent by misconstruing the dicta laid down in cases titled 
“Muhammad Asif Awan v. Dawood Khan and others” (2021 SCMR 
1270) and “Muhammad Jehanzaib Khan v. Muhammad Rafique Khan and 
two others” [2021 PLC (CS) 1435]. 
3.  
Conversely, Mr. Muhammad Mehrban Ranjha, Advocate, 
learned counsel for the respondent has supported the impugned judgment 
and decree and contends that the Appellate Court below has rightly placed 
reliance on Muhammad Asif Awan case supra as well as Muhammad 
Jehanzaib Khan case supra as also the admission of the petitioner before 
the Trial Court that the agreement was lawfully executed and he has no 
objection if the suit is decreed. Adds that since the agreement has been 
admitted, therefore, the petitioner has no case. Further avers that the 
respondent only delayed the deposit of the balance amount because the 
suit property was part of Tawakkal Town, Multan against which 
proceedings were pending before the National Accountability Bureau 
(“the NAB”).   
4.  
Dr. Ashraf Ali Qureshi, Advocate, learned counsel for the 
applicant in C.M. No. 2833/2022 submits that the applicant is a bona fide 
purchaser and has been defrauded by the collusion of the petitioner with 
the respondent and needs to be protected as he has paid the entire sale 
consideration to the petitioner and is in possession of the suit property.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  

C.R. No.323/2022

6.  
This case puts forth the following questions to be adjudicated by 
this Court: 
i. 
What are the key factors to be kept in sight 
while 
determining 
the 
willingness 
and 
readiness of a plaintiff in a suit for specific 
performance of the contract? 
 
ii. 
Whether in facts and circumstances of the case 
the Appellate Court below was justified in 
relying on the admission of execution of the 
agreement by the petitioner before the Trial 
Court?  
 
iii. 
Whether an offer made by a party (the 
defendant) before the Trial Court to decree the 
suit for specific performance of the contract, 
which was not accepted by the other party (the 
plaintiff) remains valid at the appellate stage?  
 
7.  
Before rendering the opinion on the above formulated questions, 
it is advantageous to encapsulate the admitted factual matrix of the case 
and resume of the proceedings before the Trial Court.  
8.  
Admittedly, the dispute relates to a plot measuring 15 marla 
bearing Khewat No.153, Khaitooni No.458 to 465, situated in Mauza 
Kaianpur inside Hadd Committee Tehsil Multan City, District Multan. It 
is not denied that in terms of the agreement, the cut-off-date for the 
payment of balance consideration amount was 30.06.2019. It is admitted 
feature of the case that till said date, the balance consideration amount 
was not paid by the respondent. It is also admitted feature of the case that 
the suit was instituted on 16.06.2020. It has been averred in the plaint that 
it was the petitioner who avoided transfer of the suit property within time 
and therefore, the suit was instituted. It is also admitted feature of the case 
that on the first date of hearing, i.e., 16.06.2020, the respondent was 
directed to deposit the Court Fee of Rs.15,000/-. On 26.06.2020, the 
petitioner entered appearance and his counsel submitted power of attorney 
as also contesting written statement with the averment that it is the 

C.R. No.323/2022  
 
4 
 
 
respondent who never tendered balance payment and the same clearly 
exhibited that the respondent is neither willing nor ready to perform his 
part of the contract and therefore, the petitioner has forfeited the earnest 
amount of Rs.1,500,000/-. The Trial Court, vide order dated 23.09.2020, 
fixed the case for arguments on the application for grant of interim 
injunction and also directed the respondent to deposit the balance 
consideration amount of Rs.3,500,000/-. On the next date of hearing, i.e., 
06.10.2020, instead of complying with the order of the Trial Court, the 
respondent filed an application under Section 151, read with Sections 148 
and 149 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”), inter alia, for 
extension in time to pay the balance consideration amount and to sine die 
adjourn the case on account of the pendency of proceedings before the 
NAB in respect of Tawakkal Town, Multan. Thereafter, another 
application was filed, by the respondent, under Order I Rule 10, CPC to 
implead the Multan Development Authority as necessary party. 
Application under Section 151 read with Sections 148 and 149, CPC was 
withdrawn, vide order dated 07.09.2021. In the meanwhile, the petitioner 
approached the NAB authorities concerned and sought clarification that 
the suit property does not form part of the Tawakkal Town, Multan and 
hence, permission be granted to the revenue officials concerned, to issue 
fard bai in respect of the suit property, which was accordingly issued. The 
Trial Court also summoned Halqa Patwari, namely, Safdar Ali for 
verification of fard bai, who appeared before the Trial Court on 
21.12.2020 and recorded his statement, which reads as under:

After the provision of the fard bai, the Trial Court, vide order dated 
07.09.2021, accepted the application for grant of interim injunction and 
again directed the respondent to deposit the balance sale consideration of 
Rs.3,500,000/. Order dated 07.09.2021 reads as under:  
“5.  
Perusal of record indicates that plaintiff/petitioner 
has filed suit for specific performance of contract on the 
basis of agreement to sell dated 14.11.2018 that he 
purchased the suit property fully detailed in head note in 
consideration 
of 
Rs.50,00,000/- 
out 
of 
which 
Rs.15,00,000/- were paid as earnest money and remaining 
amount Rs.35,00,000/- was promised to be paid at time of 
execution of sale deed on 30.06.2019 but possession was 
not delivered to him; while on the one hand, the defendant 
has admitted the execution of agreement to sell but he took 
plea that defendant has failed to pay the remaining 
consideration amount within time up till 30.06.2019. In this 
way the agreement has become rescind itself. The non-
depositing of remaining sale price within time will be 
determined at touch stone of evidence. So, in view of above 
observations as per admission of defendant regarding 
execution of agreement to sell, prima facie petitioner has 
good arguable case. It is pertinent to mention here that on 
23.09.2020 the plaintiff was directed to deposit the 
remaining sale price to show his willingness and 
subsequently on 24.02.2021 the defendant has recorded his 
conceding statement to decree the suit if plaintiff deposit 
the remaining sale price but inspite of this, plaintiff failed 
for compliance of such order. Therefore, in the interest of 
justice, the petition in hand is hereby accepted and ad-
interim already granted on 16.06.2020 is hereby confirmed 
with subject to deposit of 
remaining sale 
price 
Rs.35,00,000/- keeping in view the case law titled “Messrs 
KUWAIT NATIONAL REAL ESTATE COMPANY 
(PVT.) LTD. and others vs. Messrs EDUCATIONAL 
EXCELLENCE LTD. and others” 2020 SCMR 171 
(Supreme Court of Pakistan) till 14.09.2021, otherwise, 
the instant application alongwith suit will be deemed to be 
dismissed.”

The respondent, instead of complying with the direction of the Trial 
Court, filed application for review of order dated 07.09.2021 on the 
ground that the petitioner’s title qua the suit property is in question and 
the petitioner be directed to seek permission from the Court of competent 
jurisdiction to sell the suit property. No reference was made in the said 
application as to whether any Court has restrained the petitioner from 
selling the suit property. The contention of the respondent was totally 
misconceived as the NAB itself clarified the position that the suit property 
is not disputed and fard bai was also issued by the revenue official 
concerned. No security was deposited by the respondent, under the law 
for, seeking review of order dated 07.09.2021. A final warning was given, 
to the respondent, by the Trial Court, on 21.09.2021 to deposit the balance 
consideration amount in the following terms:

(Emphasis supplied)
 
In the meanwhile, the respondent filed an application for transfer of the 
case, which application was also dismissed. Thereafter, the case was 
fixed for 18.10.2021, when again another warning was given to the 
respondent in the following terms:  
“Today the instant case was fixed for depositing of 
remaining sale amount but today again the plaintiff has 
failed to produce any receipt regarding depositing of 
remaining sale amount. At this stage, order of learned 
appellate Court has been submitted in which transfer 
application filed by the plaintiff has been dismissed. 
Keeping in view the case law titled “Messrs KUWAIT 
NATIONAL REAL ESTATE COMPANY (PVT) LTD 

C.R. No.323/2022  
 
7 
 
 
and others vs Messrs EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE 
LTD and others” 2020 SCMR 171 (Supreme Court of 
Pakistan), plaintiff is directed to deposit remaining 
consideration amount i.e. Rs.35,00,000/- till 20.10.2021 as 
per order dated 14.10.2021, positively.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
The respondent remained failed to comply with the above quoted order 
of the Trial Court to deposit the remaining sale consideration and 
hence, vide order dated 20.10.2021, the respondent’s suit was 
dismissed. However, in appeal, the findings of the Trial Court were 
reversed on the ground that the petitioner has consented to the passing 
of the decree, before the Trial Court, therefore, the respondent is 
entitled to decree of specific performance of the agreement. 
9. 
Adverting to the first question, it is pertinent to observe that in 
terms of Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (“the Act”), the 
jurisdiction of the Courts to issue a decree of specific performance is 
discretionary in nature as it is an equitable relief, thus, the Court is not 
bound to grant such relief merely because it is lawful to do so let alone 
that the same is exercised in favour of a plaintiff who has exhibited 
contumacious conduct by not complying with repeated directions of the 
Court to pay balance amount of sale consideration. Cases reported as 
“Mrs. Mussarat Shaukat Ali v. Mrs. Safia Khatoon and others (1994 
SCMR 2189); Muhammad Abdur Rehman Qureshi v. Sagheer Ahmad 
(2017 SCMR 1696); and “Mrs. Zakia Hussain and another v. Syed 
Farooq Hussain (PLD 2020 S.C. 401) are referred in this regard. 
Equity mandates that in a suit for specific performance, it is the duty of 
the Court to find out, which party has not performed and is trying to 
wriggle out of his contractual obligations. In exercise of such 
discretion, the Court may consider the conduct of the parties which 
becomes relevant in granting and/or refusing decree for specific 
performance being discretionary and based on principles of equity. In 
cases involving specific performance, the primary part of the contract is 
the consideration to be paid by the vendee for which he must exhibit his 
willingness and readiness, at all times. In this regard, he must 

C.R. No.323/2022  
 
8 
 
 
unconditionally seek permission of the Court, on the first date of 
hearing, to deposit the remaining sale consideration. The Supreme 
Court in case reported as “Hamood Mehmood v. Mst. Shababa Ishaque 
and others” (2017 SCMR 2022) observed that it is mandatory for a 
person seeking performance of the contract, under the Act 1877, to seek 
permission of the Court to deposit the balance sale consideration and 
any contumacy/omission in this regard would entail dismissal of the 
suit. While willingness and readiness of a plaintiff in a suit for specific 
performance of the contract is crucial and relevant, there are certain 
aspects which may be relevant viz-a-viz the conduct of the 
plaintiff/vendee entitling and/or disentitling him from the decree for 
specific performance. It is to be kept in sight that the law of limitation 
prescribes a specific time for institution of suit for specific performance 
and the same is considered within time even if filed on the last day of 
the limitation period prescribed under the law. However, the vendee, as 
part of natural human conduct, is expected to immediately file a suit for 
specific performance of contract on refusal of the vendor to adhere to 
his contractual obligations which would exhibit that the vendee is 
willing and ready to perform his part of the contract in terms of deposit 
of the balance consideration. Any delay in this regard may indicate his 
intention that the plaintiff/vendee himself is not ready and willing to 
perform his part of the contract and the Court may refuse to grant 
specific performance on account of such conduct. This is so because it 
also needs to be kept in sight that in a rising market, the vendee makes 
a profit by the delay after tying down the seller by creating false 
excuses. In the present case, there is no explanation in the suit as to 
why the respondent remained mum for a period of almost one year after 
the cut-off-date and never acted promptly to institute the suit.  
10. 
Having the above legal position in sight and keeping in view the 
brief resume of the entire proceedings that took place before the Trial 
Court and analyzed hereinabove, this Court is of the opinion that the 
respondent entered into the agreement with the petitioner and 

C.R. No.323/2022  
 
9 
 
 
thereafter, entangled the latter into litigation and avoided the payment 
of the balance consideration amount on one pretext or the other, which 
propels to opine that the respondent was neither willing nor ready to 
pay the balance amount of consideration and the Appellate Court below 
was not justified in relying on the admission of execution of the 
agreement by the petitioner before the Trial Court to decree the suit of 
the respondent. In fact, when the direction of the Trial Court dated 
23.09.2020 was not complied with by the respondent, the Trial Court 
should have immediately proceeded to dismiss the suit in terms of dicta 
laid down in case titled “M/s Kuwait National Real Estate Company 
(Pvt) Ltd. and others v. M/s Educational Excellence Limited and 
others” (2020 SCMR 171) and by not doing so the Trial Court too 
proceeded with irregularity that added to the agony of the petitioner.  
11. 
The Appellate Court below was not justified in relying on the 
admission of execution of the agreement by the petitioner before the 
Trial Court and the offer of the petitioner that he has no objection if the 
suit is decreed ignoring the fact that said offer was conditional and 
subject to payment/deposit of balance amount of consideration. Offer of 
the petitioner recorded in order dated 24.02.2021 reads as under: 
’’
 ب  ر فلح ایبن ایک ہک ارگ دمیع ہیقب زر نمث دالخ دعال  رک دے وت دمیع اک دوعی ڈرگی ےیک اجےن رپ
ارتعاض ہن ےہ‘‘
 
The respondent never deposited the balance consideration before the 
Trial Court. Therefore, offer of the petitioner, quoted hereinabove, and 
the admission of execution of the agreement does not justify the 
contumacious conduct of the respondent.  The Appellate Court below 
also erred by not appreciating that in terms of the dicta laid down in 
Hamood Mehmood case supra, the respondent himself should have 
sought permission of the Court to deposit the remaining sale 
consideration. On the contrary, the respondent failed to comply with the 
repeated directions of the Trial Court to deposit the same. In fact, the 
manner in which the respondent put spooks in the wheel of the 
proceedings before the Trial Court by filing various applications go on 

C.R. No.323/2022  
 
10 
 
 
to reflect his non-readiness, if not unwillingness, to perform his part of 
the contract by payment of the remaining sale consideration. Therefore, 
the Trial Court rightly passed order dated 20.10.2021. When the appeal 
was preferred on 25.10.2021, the Appellate Court below directed the 
respondent to pay the Court Fee and also remaining consideration 
amount of Rs.3,500,000/- on/or before 06.11.2021 when only Court Fee 
was deposited and the order of the Appellate Court regarding deposit of 
balance consideration was not complied with. No extension was 
solicited by the respondent. An application was filed with the Duty 
Judge on 17.11.2021 and order was procured to deposit the balance 
amount of consideration when the petitioner was not even heard. The 
application was allowed by the Duty Judge while recording findings on 
the top margin of the application, in the following terms:  
“Petition is allowed as per request of the 
petitioner. The amount may be deposited through 
Bank challan.” 
When the appeal was finally heard, the Appellate Court below while 
relying upon the cases of Muhammad Asif Awan and Muhammad 
Jahanzaib Khan supra accepted the appeal of the respondent. It has 
been noted that the case of Muhammad Asif Awan supra is not attracted 
in the present matter inasmuch as no warning was given to the vendee 
of the said case to deposit the balance consideration as opposed to the 
factual matrix of the present case where repeatedly, the respondent was 
directed to deposit the balance consideration while stipulating penal 
consequences but to no avail. It is pertinent to note that the 
petitioner/defendant having refuted the assertion of the respondent that 
the suit property was under caution by the NAB and obtained fard bai 
and also extended an offer to the respondent/plaintiff during the trial 
proceedings, which the respondent/plaintiff by his conduct refused to 
accept. As a natural corollary, the offer made by the defendant 
evaporated and dissipated. This Court is of the opinion that in peculiar 
facts and circumstances of the case, a conditional offer made by a party 
(the defendant) before the Trial Court to decree the suit for specific 

C.R. No.323/2022  
 
11 
 
 
performance of the contract, which was not accepted by the other party 
(the plaintiff) does not remain valid at the appellate stage. Therefore, it 
was unjustified to pass the impugned judgment and decree on the basis 
of an offer which no longer existed, in favour of litigant who has acted 
in a contumacious manner.  Insofar as the case law cited as Muhammad 
Jahanzaib Khan supra is concerned, the same is distinguishable and not 
applicable to the present case as in the said case, the Court held that 
direction of deposit of remaining sale consideration was not justifiable 
on the ground that the execution of the agreement to sell, in the said 
case, was specifically denied which is not the situation in the present 
case where not only the execution is admitted but the petitioner also 
offered his willingness to sell if the respondent had made payment of 
remaining sale consideration, which the latter failed to meet.  
12. 
The matter can be examined from another angle. The same 
relates to the stubbornness on the part of the respondent to purchase the                 
suit property even though, as per his stance, the same was under 
encumbrance by NAB authorities, which stance though was belied after 
the clearance was given by the NAB authorities and fard bai was issued 
by the Halqa Patwari. This perplexes a reasonable mind as to why the 
respondent was bent upon purchasing a property which, if his stance 
was correct, was prohibited to be transacted, by the NAB as this was 
the only concern shown by the respondent for non-adherence to his part 
of the contractual obligations as also the repeated directions of the Trial 
Court to deposit the balance consideration. The clearance by NAB 
authorities coupled with the offer by the petitioner (vendor) should 
have prompted the respondent to grab the opportunity but he protracted 
the payment before the Trial Court on one pretext or the other. Even 
when the Appellate Court below admitted the appeal of the respondent 
for hearing and directed him to pay the balance consideration, the said 
direction was not complied within stipulated period of time and the 
deposit was only made in a clandestine manner while filing an 
application before the Duty Judge who merely allowed the same 

C.R. No.323/2022  
 
12 
 
 
without examining the record and hearing the petitioner. Even at the 
time of filing the appeal, the respondent could have exhibited that he is 
willing and ready to pay the balance consideration but he did not do so 
and the Appellate Court below itself had to direct the respondent to 
deposit remaining consideration by 06.11.2021, which was not adhered 
to by the respondent that further reflects on contumacious conduct of 
the respondent qua claim of equitable relief. On a pointed question, put 
thrice by this Court, to the respondent as to whether he can show a 
single document to exhibit his financial position to pay the balance 
amount on the cut-off date, the date of institution of suit or such other 
dates of hearing when the Trial Court gave multiple warnings, he was 
completely speechless for a while and stated that he sold his house to 
pay the balance amount before the Appellate Court below. This fact in 
itself indicates that the respondent after tying down the property of the 
petitioner under the agreement, had no capacity to pay the balance 
consideration, instituted the suit after about one year from the elapse of 
the cut-off date under the agreement and despite repeated directions by 
the Trial Court never deposited the balance amount that exhibits unjust 
and unfair approach of the petitioner towards discharge of his 
contractual obligations and hence, disentitles him from grant of 
equitable relief of specific performance. Suffice to observe that the 
performance of the contract is not to be seen from the date when it is 
suitable to the plaintiff. To adjudge whether the plaintiff is ready and 
willing to perform his part of the contract, the Court must take into 
consideration the conduct of the plaintiff prior as well as subsequent to 
the institution of the suit alongwith other attending circumstances. The 
amount of consideration which he has to pay to the defendant must of 
necessity be proved to be available. Right from the cut-off date set for 
completion of the contract till date of the decree, the plaintiff must 
prove that he is ready and has always been willing to perform his part 
of the contract.  

C.R. No.323/2022  
 
13 
 
 
13. 
In view of the preceding discussion, this Court is of the view that 
the conduct of the respondent has been far from fair and he has failed to 
make out a case for the grant of any equitable relief since his conduct 
amply shows that he was not ready and willing to perform his part of 
the contract: neither (i) when the suit was instituted; (ii) nor when the 
interim injunction was granted; nor (iii) throughout the proceedings 
before the Trial Court and only deposited the amount, at the appellate 
stage, when it suited him, which aspect has escaped the notice of the 
Appellate Court, hence, the impugned judgment and decree dated 
03.03.2022 passed by the Appellate Court below is set aside and the 
order of the Trial Court dated 20.10.2021 dismissing the suit of the 
respondent is upheld.  
14. 
It is well evident that the respondent has acted contumaciously, 
however, this Court is to keep in sight that the petitioner sold the suit 
property to the applicant of C.M. No.2833/2022 for Rs.6,600,000/-, i.e., 
Rs.1,600,000/- in excess of the amount agreed to be paid by the 
respondent under the agreement. In the circumstances, forfeiting the 
earnest money would be a harsh decision, therefore, the amount of 
earnest money, which the petitioner received, is to be returned to the 
respondent within a period of two months from today. In view of the 
fact that the revision petition has been accepted and the impugned 
judgment in favour of the respondent has been set aside, C.M. 
No.2833/2022 has become infructuous.
