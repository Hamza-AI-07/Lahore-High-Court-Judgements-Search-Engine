    JUDGMENT 
 
Date of Hearing

Petitioner by 
Mr. Imtiaz Ashiq Rasool, Advocate.  
Respondents No.2 
& 3 by 
Respondents No.2 & 3 in person.  
State by 
Ms. Rashida Parveen, Assistant District 
Public Prosecutor with Khadim Hussain SI.   
 
 Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi, J: Through this petition, 
petitioner assails the order dated 05.05.2023, passed by the 
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Zafarwal, upon criminal 
revision instituted by respondents No.2 & 3 by virtue of which 
the order passed by the learned Magistrate regarding the 
summoning of respondents No.2 & 3 in connection with a 
private complaint, instituted by the present petitioner stands set 
aside.  
2.           Heard. Record perused.  
     3.           Perusal of the summoning order dated 02.07.2021, 
passed by learned Magistrate Section 30, Zafarwal reveals that 
subject complaint carries allegation against the respondents 
with regard to the perpetration of offences punishable under 
sections 452, 506 (ii) PPC read with section 34 PPC. The 
cursory statements of the witnesses recorded and the documents 
produced during the preliminary inquiry under section

202 Cr.P.C prima facie, support the narration available in the 
private complaint. There remains no doubt about the 
proposition that for the purpose of issuance of process to the 
accused under section 204 Cr.P.C, evidence sufficient to 
establish guilt of the accused is not required, the learned Court 
is desired by Law only to look for the availability of sufficient 
ground to proceed further with the complaint that requires 
tentative assessment of the evidence at hand till then only and 
sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence available for the 
issuance of process is for the Court seized with the matter to 
decide. The Court even is not required to state detailed reasons 
in support of its order. Perusal of the order, passed by the 
learned Revisional Court impugned through this petition reveals 
that the learned Additional Sessions Judge has travelled beyond 
his limit while considering the earlier registration of an F.I.R 
No. 90/2018 at the instance of the accused/respondent No.2 that 
was not the part of the record before the learned summoning 
court when the order under revision was passed. The 
appropriate course for the accused/respondents in the situation 
was to approach the learned trial Court by moving application 
under section 249-A Cr.P.C if they consider that in view of the 
facts with them, there was no chance of their conviction and 
that further proceedings in the trial would be a futile exercise. It 
is also relevant to mention here that the summoning order 
passed under section 204 Cr.P.C is not a judgment or final order 
as contemplated by section 369 Cr.P.C and the same can be 
reconsidered, revisited or recalled at any stage. Similarly, the

learned revisional court while determining the propriety or 
legality of the subject summoning order could only look into 
the material or evidence available to the learned court below 
when the order was passed and not beyond. This Court is of the 
opinion that the reasons given by the learned Magistrate were 
sufficient to justify the issuance of process under section 204 
Cr.P.C, hence, this petition is allowed and the order passed by 
the learned Additional Sessions Judge challenged by the 
petitioner/complainant is set aside. The learned trial Court shall 
proceed further with the private complaint instituted by the 
petitioner/complainant in accordance with law.
