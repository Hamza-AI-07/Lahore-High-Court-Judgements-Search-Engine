ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J. This Civil Revision brings a challenge to 
Judgments & Decrees dated 30.11.2010 and 23.05.2012 passed by Civil 
Judge, Ferozewala and Additional District Judge, Ferozewala, respectively, 
whereby, the suit for declaration filed by the Petitioners was dismissed and 
the suit for declaration instituted by the Respondents was decreed. The 
Petitioners filed two separate Appeals against the decision of the Trial Court 
which were dismissed and the findings of the Trial Court were maintained.  
2. 
The stance of the Petitioners was that they are owners in possession of 
the property measuring 12 Kanals and 17 Marlas fully described in para No. 
1 of the plaint (the “suit property”) which they purchased against sale 
consideration of Rs. 55,000/- through registered sale deed No. 230 dated 
26.04.1984 (the “Sale Deed”). However, on account of an inadvertent error, 
the respective shares in the suit property of Respondents No. 1 and 2, namely, 
Manzoor Ahmed and Noor Ahmed were wrongly mentioned in the Sale 
Deed. Therefore, the shares of the Respondents listed in the Sale Deed were 
liable to be rectified so that mutation pursuant thereto may be incorporated in 
the revenue record. Conversely, the version of the Respondents was that they 
had given the suit property on lease to the Petitioners and had asked them to 

2 
C. R. No. 1933 of 2012 
prepare lease deed but they prepared and got registered the false and bogus 
Sale Deed in their favour in connivance with the officials. The execution of 
the Sale Deed and receipt of sale consideration was denied. It was alleged 
that the Petitioners have been paying the share of produce but lately stopped 
paying the same. Moreover, at the time of execution of the alleged Sale Deed, 
Mst. Zubaida Bibi and Mst. Hameeda Bibi, Respondents No. 5 & 7, 
respectively, were minors and as such, the Sale Deed was unlawfully 
executed which is liable to be set aside being void and ineffective qua the 
rights of the Respondents. 
3. 
It is noted that in the first round of litigation, the suit of the Petitioners 
was decreed vide Judgment & Decree dated 01.10.2001 regarding which an 
Appeal was accepted and the case was remanded to the Trial Court for its 
decision afresh after framing additional issues and recording evidence. The 
Trial Court framed the following consolidated issues:- 
(1) 
Whether the registered Sale Deed is liable to be corrected? OPP 
(2) 
Whether the suit is barred by limitation? OPD 
(3)  
Whether suit cannot proceed in present form? OPD  
(4) 
Whether the Sale Deed is result of fraud and ineffective qua the 
rights of the defendants? OPD 
(5) 
Whether the suit is undervalued for the purpose of court fee, if 
so, its effect? OPD 
(6) 
Whether the plaintiffs have not come to the court with clean 
hands? OPD 
(6-A) Whether defendants No. 5 and 7 were minors at the time of 
execution of the impugned Sale Deed? OPD 
(6-B) Whether the Sale Deed is based on fraud and misrepresentation 
and ineffective upon the rights of the Plaintiffs? OPD 
(6-C) Whether the alleged Sale Deed was kept secret and in the year 
1995, the defendants came to know the sale transaction? OPD 
(6-D) Whether the suit titled as Manzoor Ahmed etc. Vs. Abdul 
Rehman etc. is unnecessary and filed to harass the proceedings 
of the suit titled as Abdul Rehman etc. Vs. Manzoor Ahmed 
etc.? OPP 
 
(7) 
Relief. 
 
4. 
The Trial Court while rendering its findings on issue No. 6-A 
concluded on the basis of Ex. D-1 & Ex. D-2 that Respondents No. 5 & 7 

3 
C. R. No. 1933 of 2012 
were minors at the time of execution of the Sale Deed and as such, their 
shares in the suit property could not have been transferred without the 
appointment of their Guardian. The Trial Court with respect to issues No. 4, 
6-B & 6-C found that all the witnesses of the Respondents corroborated their 
version that suit property was given to the Petitioners on lease for a period of 
10 years. The Sale Deed (Ex. P-1) did not mention the Fard Malkiat on the 
basis of which the Respondents were owners which showed that it was 
passed with undue haste in favour of the Petitioners by the Revenue 
Authorities due to which their shares were incorrectly mentioned. It was 
further observed that the alleged mistake came in the knowledge of the 
Petitioners when they went to Halqa Patwari in the year 1984 but the suit for 
rectification was filed with a delay of 11 years which ipso facto meant that 
the sale transaction was kept secret by the Petitioners from the Respondents. 
These facts proved that the Sale Deed was based upon fraud. The Trial Court 
with respect to issue No. 6-D observed that the Respondents filed their suit 
for declaration on 09.07.2002, whereas, they appeared in the proceedings of 
the suit filed by the Petitioners in October, 1996, and as such, the suit of the 
Respondents was within the prescribed period of limitation of six years. 
Therefore, the Respondents did not file the suit for declaration in order to 
harass the Petitioners as they did not know about the existence of the Sale 
Deed till 1996 until they appeared in the suit filed by the Petitioners. Based 
upon the aforesaid findings, the Trial Court declined to rectify the Sale Deed 
by rendering its findings against the Petitioners to issue No. 1. Against issue 
No. 2, the Trial Court found that the Sale Deed was executed in the year 
1984, whereas, the Petitioners filed the suit in the year 1995 which was 
barred by time since they had gained knowledge of the alleged mistakes 
when they had gone to Halqa Patwari a few days after the execution of the 
Sale Deed. Issue No. 3 was also decided in favour of the Respondents for 
reasons stated as aforesaid. Issues No. 5 & 6 were not pressed.  
5. 
The Appellate Court while maintaining the findings of the Trial Court 
in addition thereto further opined that identity card numbers of some of the 
Respondents were not mentioned in the Sale Deed. Moreover, thumb 
impressions of some of the parties were hardly visible and the two marginal 

4 
C. R. No. 1933 of 2012 
witnesses were not produced by the Petitioners as beneficiaries of the Sale 
Deed to prove the transaction of sale as per law. 
6. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the impugned 
Judgments & Decrees passed by the Courts below are result of misreading 
and non-reading of evidence on record as well as misapplication of law. He 
contended that the Sale Deed itself stipulated that the same was executed on 
the basis of Fard Malkiat but this fact escaped the attention of the Courts 
below. The Sale Deed was executed in the year 1984 and the observations 
that identity card numbers of some of the Respondents were not listed 
thereon or thumb impressions were dim were immaterial. It was 
unequivocally established on the basis of evidence on record that stamp 
papers were purchased by the Respondents themselves and execution of the 
Sale Deed was admitted in the written statement which required no further 
proof with respect to its execution. No particulars of fraud were mentioned 
by the Respondents in their plaint or written statement in both the suits. 
Similarly, no evidence was tendered pertaining to the alleged fraud. The 
observation that two marginal witnesses were not produced was based on 
misapplication of law. One marginal witness, namely, Malik Bashir had 
appeared as a witness fulfilling legal requirement in terms of Section 68 of 
the Evidence Act, 1872 (the “Evidence Act”) as the Qanoon-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984 was promulgated on 26.10.1984 after the execution of the Sale 
Deed. Hence, the sale transaction was duly proved especially when the same 
was admitted in the written statement. He stressed that both the Courts below 
were swayed to dismiss the claim of the Petitioners primarily for the reason 
that Respondents No. 5 & 7 were minors at the time of execution of the Sale 
Deed. It was the responsibility of the Respondents to have appointed 
Guardian in case of minority of Respondents No. 5 and 7. Notwithstanding 
the same, as per record, Respondents No. 5 & 7 having been born on 
29.01.1967 and 16.06.1973 (Ex. D-1 & Ex. D-2) attained majority on 
29.01.1985 and 16.06.1991, respectively and in terms of Sections 6 and 8 
read with Article 91 to the First Schedule of the Limitation Act, 1908 (the 
“Limitation Act”) were required to file suit within 3 years after the disability 
of minority ceased but the suit for declaration by the Respondents including 

5 
C. R. No. 1933 of 2012 
Respondents No. 5 & 7 was filed on 09.07.2002 which was way beyond the 
prescribed period of limitation. Finally, he emphasized that it was clearly 
evident from the deposition of DW-1 recorded on 20.09.2001 that the 
Respondents were aware about the Sale Deed executed in 1984. Hence, the 
suit filed by the Respondents was barred by time. Conversely, the suit of the 
Petitioners was within time as the date of knowledge of non-incorporation of 
mutation was misconstrued. Accordingly, he prayed that suit of the 
Petitioners was liable to be decreed in their favour as the execution of the 
Sale Deed was admitted and the Petitioners even otherwise, produced 
irrefutable evidence to substantiate and prove their claim in terms of 
execution of the Sale Deed and payment of consideration. 
7. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondents relied upon the 
reasoning of the Courts below and prayed that the concurrent Judgments & 
Decrees are not liable to be interfered.  
8. 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
9. 
Issues No. 1, 4 and 6-B deal with the validity of the Sale Deed and are 
interlinked. Perusal of the plaint reveals that the Petitioners had merely 
sought rectification of the Sale Deed on the ground that on account of errors 
in the respective shares of the Respondents as sellers, the mutation on the 
basis of the Sale Deed could not be incorporated in the revenue record and as 
such, the rectification was liable to be ordered after refusal of the same by the 
Respondents. Importantly, in paragraph No. 2 of the written statement, the 
Respondents specifically admitted that they had signed and thumb marked 
the Sale Deed, however, the same was done with the understanding that it 
was lease deed and as such, the Sale Deed was result of fraud and 
misrepresentation. The possession of the Petitioners over the suit property 
was not disputed. The Petitioners filed the suit on 22.11.1995. Initially, the 
suit was decreed by the Trial Court vide Judgment & Decree dated 
01.10.2001. In the said Judgment, it was observed by the Trial Court that the 
Sale Deed executed in the year 1984 had remained unchallenged and the 
Respondents had not filed any suit against the Petitioners although the 
Petitioners had instituted the suit in the year 1995. The entries in the revenue 
record provided a fresh cause of action and as such, the suit of the Petitioners 

6 
C. R. No. 1933 of 2012 
was not barred by time. It was also observed therein that DW-2 had admitted 
in his cross-examination that the other Respondents had told him after 2 years 
from 1983-84, that a fraud had been committed with them but even then they 
did not challenge the Sale Deed in favour of the Petitioners after getting 
knowledge of the institution of the suit. It was further observed therein that 
the Respondents did not produce any witness to substantiate their defence 
regarding lease of the suit property. It was further observed that defence of 
the Respondents that Respondents No. 5 & 7 were minors at the time of 
execution of the Sale Deed cannot be considered as they had not filed any 
independent suit for cancellation of the Sale Deed despite gaining knowledge 
of the same. The passing of sale consideration before the Sub-Registrar was 
fully proved and one of the witness who had identified the parties had 
expressed the intention of the parties regarding the sale transaction. As such, 
the validity of the Sale Deed was confirmed and the required rectification 
was ordered by decreeing the suit. The said Judgment of the Trial Court was 
set aside by the Appellate Court vide its Judgment & Decree dated 
26.02.2002 with a direction to frame additional issues and decision of the 
case afresh after recording of evidence of the parties. 
10. 
The observations of the Trial Court in the first round of litigation 
prompted the Respondents to file an independent suit for declaration on 
09.07.2002 seeking cancellation of the Sale Deed based upon their initial 
stance taken in the written statement in the suit for declaration filed by the 
Petitioners. In the said suit, it was alleged that it was upon the filing of the 
suit by the Petitioners that the Respondents came to know about the existence 
of the Sale Deed against them.  
11. 
The witnesses of the Petitioners deposed in line with their pleadings. 
The execution of the Sale Deed and passing of sale consideration of Rs. 
55,000/- was duly testified. The fact of incorrect recording of shares of the 
Respondents in the Sale Deed was highlighted by the Petitioners. The 
allegation of fraud or lease of the suit property as alleged by the Respondents 
was denied in the suggestion put forward to the witnesses. The stamp vendor, 
PW-6 candidly deposed that he issued the stamp paper and scribed the Sale 
Deed upon the instructions of the parties before the concerned Sub-Registrar. 

7 
C. R. No. 1933 of 2012 
The independent witnesses also testified the due execution of the Sale Deed, 
the possession of the Petitioners and the fact that the same was known to the 
residents of the Mouza. It was also testified that the Sale Deed was read out 
to the parties. PW-9 specifically deposed that although the Petitioners had 
gone to the Halqa Patwari for attestation of mutation after a few days from 
the date of registration of the Sale Deed but they came to know 5 to 6 years 
later that the mutation had not been entered in the revenue record for the 
reason that there were errors in the Sale Deed with respect to the shares of the 
Respondents incorporated therein. 
12. 
DW-1 in his cross-examination categorically admitted that he did not 
know the location of the suit property and he came to know 8 to 9 years ago 
that the Petitioners were not paying the lease money and a fraud had been 
committed with them. Similarly, DW-2, an independent witness produced by 
the Respondents deposed that he met the Respondents in the year 1983-84 
and they had told him that they had been fraudulently deprived from the suit 
property. Manzoor Ahmad, DW-3 in his cross-examination admitted that 
price of the suit property was between Rs. 50,000/- to Rs. 60,000/- at the time 
of execution of the Sale Deed. He admitted his thumb impressions on the 
Sale Deed though stated that the suit property was given on lease. He also 
admitted that he executed the stamp papers in Sharqpur and the Tehsildar 
also inquired him about the receiving of consideration. He also testified that 
there were mistakes in the shares of the Respondents in the Sale Deed. 
13. 
Conspicuously, the pivotal document, the Sale Deed (Ex. P-1) 
specifically stipulates that the shares of the Respondents are listed as per 
Fard Bah, Register Haqdaran Zamin for the year 1979-80 issued by the 
concerned Halqa Patwari alongwith mutation of inheritance No. 414. As 
such, the observation of the Courts below that the Sale Deed was not 
incorporated with reference to any Fard Bah was clearly result of non-
reading of evidence. It, therefore, follows that execution of the Sale Deed, 
passing of sale consideration and due registration of the Sale Deed were duly 
proved. The Respondents did not mention any particulars of fraud with 
respect to execution and registration of the Sale Deed and the same were also 
not proved through production of evidence. The Respondents also failed to 

8 
C. R. No. 1933 of 2012 
prove any counter lease deed in terms of the stance taken by them. They also 
did not produce any receipts of payment regarding the lease money and relied 
upon their oral evidence in this respect. It is also noted that Qanoon-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 was promulgated on 26.10.1984, whereas, the Sale 
Deed was executed on 26.04.1984 and as such, it was required to be proved 
in terms of Section 68 of the Evidence Act which required that one marginal 
witness was sufficient to prove the sale transaction. For reference see case 
titled, “Noor Muhammad v. Nazar Muhammad” (2002 SCMR 1301). 
Notwithstanding the same, a number of witnesses including independent and 
official witnesses were produced by the Petitioners to prove the transaction. 
Therefore, the Courts below fell in error while rendering their findings to 
issues No. 1, 4 and 6-B. 
14. 
The questions of limitation, maintainability of the suit and secrecy of 
the Sale Deed were encapsulated in issues No. 2, 3 and 6-C. It was 
established on the basis of evidence on record that the Sale Deed was never 
kept secret and was known to the inhabitants of the concerned Mouza as 
stated above. The witnesses of the Respondents had admitted their 
knowledge about the Sale Deed in the year 1984. It was also admitted in the 
written statement that a suit for declaration and cancellation of the Sale Deed 
was instituted in the light of the observations of the Trial Court vide 
Judgment & Decree dated 01.10.2001 in the first round of litigation. 
Therefore, the suit instituted by the Respondents was patently barred by time. 
Needless to mention that Article 91 to the First Schedule of the Limitation 
Act prescribes a period of 03 years for filing the suit for cancellation of 
document from the date of knowledge. Reliance is placed on cases titled, 
“Muhammad Irfan Polani v. Mst. Farida Shaukat, etc.” (PLJ 2017 Lahore 
776); and “Dr. Muhammad Javaid Shafi v. Syed Rashid Arshad and others” 
(PLD 2015 Supreme Court 212). Conversely, it was proved on record that 
the Petitioners gained knowledge regarding non-attestation of the mutation 
pursuant to the Sale Deed after 6 to 7 years from the date of its execution i.e. 
in the year 1990 or 1991 and as such, the suit filed by them in the year 1995 
was within time in terms of Article 120 to the First Schedule of the 

9 
C. R. No. 1933 of 2012 
Limitation Act. Therefore, the findings of the Courts below to afore referred 
issues are reversed.   
15. 
The last aspect of the case is with respect to the minority of 
Respondents No. 5 & 7, respectively who attained majority on 29.01.1985 
and 16.06.1991, respectively. Sections 6 and 8 of the Limitation Act 
prescribe a period of 03 years for the minors to challenge a transaction 
entered on their behalf after ceasing of their disability. However, it had been 
established that the Respondents had gained knowledge regarding the 
execution of the Sale Deed but instituted the suit in the year 2002 which was 
patently barred by time even to the extent of Respondents No. 5 & 7 
regarding their plea that the transaction was not valid on account of their 
minority at the time of execution of the Sale Deed. It is importantly noted 
that in case titled, “Tanveer Mahboob and another v. Haroon and others” 
(2003 SCMR 480), it was observed that in a case in which a minor defendant 
in the suit was represented by his father or brother or sister as co-defendant 
without any conflict of interest with sincerity and they effectively defended 
the rights and interest of the minor in the property, it would be deemed that 
such rights were sufficiently safeguarded and mere fact that minor was not 
sued through guardian-ad-litem would not make the decree invalid and the 
same would be binding on the minor. It was also observed based upon the 
Judgment of Indian jurisdiction that non-fulfillment of formal requirement of 
appointment of guardian ad-litem of a minor defendant under Order XXXII, 
Rule 3, C.P.C. would not affect the proceedings in the suit and decree, if 
ultimately passed, unless it is shown that due to omission of appointment of 
guardian-at-litem of a minor, who was being represented by his natural 
guardian, the minor was caused prejudice and the objection would be of 
technical nature. Further, reliance is placed on case titled, “Abdul Razzaq v. 
Add: District Judge and others” (2016 YLR 2694). Hence, the findings to 
issue No. 6-A of the Courts below are reversed. It is also abundantly clear 
that the Respondents filed their suit merely as an afterthought as a counter 
blast to the suit of the Petitioners. Issue No. 6-D is answered, accordingly.    
16. 
In view of the above discussion, it is manifestly evident that the Courts 
below have misread and non-read the evidence on record. It is a general rule 

10 
C. R. No. 1933 of 2012 
that the Revisional Court while exercising jurisdiction vested under Section 
115 of the C.P.C. does not upset the concurrent findings recorded by the 
Courts below. This principle is based on the premise that the Appellate Court 
is the final Court of fact but it is equally established that where there is gross 
misreading and non-reading of evidence or the Courts below have acted in 
exercise of their jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity, the 
concurrent findings of facts are liable to be set aside in exercise of revisional 
jurisdiction.  Reliance is placed on cases titled, “Haji Wajdad v. Provincial 
Government through Secretary Board of Revenue Government of 
Balochistan, Quetta and others” (2020 SCMR 2046); “Malik Bahadur Sher 
Khan v. Haji Shah Alam and others” (2017 SCMR 902); “Nazir Ahmad and 
another v. M. Muzaffar Hussain” (2008 SCMR 1639); and “Ghulam 
Muhammad and 3 others v. Ghulam Ali” (2004 SCMR 1001). 
17. 
In view of the above, this Civil Revision is allowed; the impugned 
Judgments & Decrees dated 30.11.2010 and 23.05.2012 passed by the Courts 
below are set aside and in consequence thereof, the suit of the Petitioners stands 
decreed and that of the Respondents is dismissed.
