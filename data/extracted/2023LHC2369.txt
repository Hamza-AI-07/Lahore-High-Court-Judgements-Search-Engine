Date of hearing:

Petitioner by: 
Mr. Nadeem Iqbal Chaudhary, Advocate.  
 
Respondents by: 
 
Ch. Arshad Ali, Advocate.  
 
AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J.  This civil revision is directed 
against the judgment and decree of learned appellate court dated 
21.02.2009 whereby while accepting the appeal of respondents decreed 
their suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell.  
2. 
 
 Briefly, the facts, forming factual canvass of this revision 
are that plaintiffs/respondents (hereinafter referred to as “respondents”) 
instituted a suit for specific performance on 06.01.2003 against the 
defendant/petitioner (hereinafter referred to as “petitioner”) by 
maintaining that petitioner agreed to sell his land measuring 09-kanals 
bearing Khata No.6, rectangle No.306/3, killa No.25 measuring 06-kanals 
11-marlas and rectangle No.306/4, killa No.5 measuring 02-kanals 09-
marlas, situated at Chak No.19-A Tehsil Liaqat Pur District Rahim Yar 
Khan (hereinafter referred to as “suit property”), for a consideration of 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP.

Rs.3,50,000/- and after receipt of Rs.100,000/- executed an agreement to 
sell dated 13.06.2002; that respondents remained ready to perform their 
part but the petitioner failed to abide by his commitment which 
constrained them to institute the suit. The petitioner resisted their suit 
through filing contested written statement on 13.06.2003 by raising 
preliminary objections that respondents have no cause of action; that 
petitioner transferred the suit property through mutation No.476 dated 
04.01.2003 to Abrar Murtaza etc.; that agreement to sell dated 13.06.2003 
was cancelled due to non-performance of the conditions as respondents 
failed to pay the remaining consideration amount within stipulated time 
and became defaulter; that the petitioner issued a written notice on 
18.09.2002 to the respondents to pay remaining consideration amount 
within two days otherwise sale bargain will be deemed to be cancelled but 
neither the respondents replied to the said notice nor paid remaining 
consideration amount, therefore, agreement has been cancelled. While 
replying on facts admitted the execution of agreement to sell, however 
reiterated the same stance pleaded in the preliminary objections. After 
submission of written statement petitioner absented from the court 
proceedings, therefore, ex-parte proceedings were initiated against him on 
11.11.2004. Respondents were asked to produce their ex-parte evidence. 
Learned trial court after recording ex-parte evidence of the respondents 
dismissed their suit vide judgment and decree dated 19.10.2007 on the 
grounds that they failed to establish on record that they remained ready to 
perform agreement to sell in letter and spirit and that inspite of the fact 
petitioner alienated the suit property to Abrar Murtaza etc. through 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP.

mutation No.576 dated 04.01.2003, they did not make them party. Feeling 
aggrieved, respondents preferred an appeal. Petitioner appeared before the 
learned appellate court but again absented himself from the court 
proceedings, therefore, ex-parte proceedings were initiated against him 
and the learned appellate court after providing opportunity of hearing to 
the respondents accepted their appeal, set aside the judgment and decree 
of learned trial court and decreed their suit vide impugned judgment and 
decree dated 21.02.2009. Being dis-satisfied, petitioner approached this 
Court through the instant revision petition.  
3. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that while 
decreeing the suit, the learned appellate Court did not consider that 
respondents failed to pay the remaining consideration amount within due 
time as per agreement and they failed to abide by their commitment as per 
agreement to sell, therefore, they were not entitled for the decree of 
specific performance which otherwise being discretionary relief could not 
be claimed by anybody as a right. Further adds that in the legal notice the 
petitioner asked the respondents to deposit/pay the balance amount of 
consideration within two days but they failed to do so which fact on the 
one hand speaks volumes about the bona fide of the petitioner towards 
completion of the contract and on the other hand proof of inaction on the 
part of the respondents towards payment of the balance amount. Argues 
that according to the latest view of the superior courts, the intent of the 
vendees to complete the agreement between the parties is discernable 
from their readiness to deposit the balance amount with the Court at the 
time of filing of suit for specific performance but the respondents did not 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
4
do so until and unless they were compelled by the Court in that regard. 
Contends that at the most the respondents were entitled for return of the 
paid amount but by no stretch of imagination they were entitled for a 
decree of specific performance. In support of his contentions, learned 
counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the cases reported as “HAMOOD 
MEHMOOD versus Mst. SHABANA ISHAQUE and others” (2017 SCMR 
2022), “SALMA Bibi and others versus Rana SAGHEER HUSSAIN” (PLD 
2022 Lahore 589), “MANZOOR HUSSAIN versus Haji KHUSHI 
MUHAMMAD” (2017 CLC 70), “LIAQAT ALI Khan and others versus 
FALAK SHER and others” (PLD 2014 Supreme Court 506), “Haji ABDUL 
KARIM and others versus Messrs FLORIDA BUILDERS (PVT) LIMITED” 
(PLD 2012 Supreme Court 247), “BOARD OF GOVERNORS, AREA 
STUDY CENTRE FOR AFRICA AND NORTH AMERICA, QUAID-E-AZAM, 
UNIVERSITY, ISLAMABAD  and another versus Ms. FARAH ZAHRA” (PLD 
2005 Supreme Court 153), “HAFEEZ Ahmad and others versus CIVIL 
JUDGE, LAHORE and others” (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 400), “NASIR

Conversely, learned counsel appearing on behalf of 
respondents, while defending the impugned judgment and decree, argues 
that since the cut-off date for final payment was 31.10.2002, the 
statements of PWs got recorded by his clients show that they were 
remained ready for payment of outstanding consideration amount, thus, 
the assertion of the learned counsel for the petitioner cannot be given any 
weightage; that in a suit for specific performance instead of deposit of 
cash in the court, the capacity of the vendees has to be judged by the 
Court and when P.W-4 Zulfiqar Ali one of the respondents while 
recording his statement categorically stated that they are ready to pay 
remaining consideration amount of Rs.2,50,000/-, no illegality was 
committed by the learned  appellate Court while decreeing the suit; that 
bona fide and readiness of the respondents to perform their part of the 
contract in the shape of payment of balance amount is also evinced from 
their evidence; that they were ever ready to pay the balance consideration 
amount; that since the respondents deposited the balance amount before 
the Court, no adverse opinion could be formed against them on the ground 
that they did not do so at the time of filling of the suit as they could not 
deposit the amount without permission of the Court; that prompt filing of 
the suit by the respondents within two months and six days from the date 
of payment of last installment speaks volume about the fact that they were 
ever ready to perform their part of contract; that even during the evidence 
PW-4 stated in clear cut words that respondents were ready to pay the 
balance amount upon execution of formal sale deed by the petitioner in 
their favour. To fortify his contentions, learned counsel for the 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP.

respondents has relied upon the cases reported as “PROVINCE OF 
PUNJAB and others versus MUHAMMAD IQBAL and others” (2010 YLR 
2759), “Malik YARAN Khan versus CHIEF LAND COMMISSIONER, 
PUNJAB, LAHORE” (2012 MLD 78), “Begum Syeda AZRA MASOOD versus 
Begum NOSHABA MOEEN and others” (2007 SCMR 914), “GHULAM 
HUSSAIN RAMZAN ALI versus COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS (PREVENTIVE), 
KARACHI” (2014 SCMR 1594), “Messrs BLUE STAR SPINNING MILLS 
LTD. versus COLLECTOR OF SALES TAX and others” (2013 SCMR 587), 
“MUHAMMAD LATIF Khan and 17 others versus MUHAMMAD RASHEED 
Khan and 63 others” (2012 MLD 86), “HAFEEZ Ahmad and others versus 
CIVIL JUDGE, LAHORE and others” (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 400), 
“LAHORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY versus Mst. SHARIFAN Bibi and 
another” (PLD 2010 Supreme Court 705), “ABDUL QADIR and 2 others 
versus JAHANGIR Khan and others” (2022 SCMR 321) and “PROVINCE 
OF PUNJAB and others versus MUHAMMAD ARIF AND COMPANY” (PLD 
2022 Lahore 596).

I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at full length 
and also gone through the record minutely with their able assistance.  
6. 
 
Admittedly suit property belonged to the petitioner who 
purchased the same through mutation No.518 dated 08.01.2001. There is 
no dispute that petitioner agreed to sell the suit property to respondents 
through agreement to sell dated 13.06.2002 for consideration of 
Rs.3,50,000/- and after receipt of Rs.100,000/- executed a receipt on the 
same day in this regard. Although petitioner did not deny the execution of 
agreement to sell and receipt of earnest money but the respondents to 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP.

prove their contentions produced Bakht Ali Scriber as P.W-1 who 
deposed that he on the asking of petitioner had written an agreement to 
sell with regard to the suit property in favour of respondents and receipt of 
Rs.100,000/-. He further deposed that said agreement to sell Exh.P-1 is 
written and signed by him and said document was entered by him in his 
register at Sr. No.17 on 13.06.2002. He also deposed that receipt Exh.P-2 
was also written and signed by him. He further deposed that petitioner 
also put his signature and thumb impression on his register and also got 
incorporated his identity card number. He maintained that he read over 
both the documents to the petitioner, respondents and attested witnesses 
who after understanding the same signed it. Respondents produced Ch. 
Muhammad Tufail attesting witness as P.W-2 and Muhammad Bashir 
attesting witness as P.W-3. Both the witnesses stated that Exh.P-1 and 
Exh.P-2 were written before them and they put their signatures and also 
identified their signatures. One of the respondents namely Zulfiqar Ali 
appeared as P.W-4 and deposed in the same lines as pleaded in the plaint. 
All the said witnesses were not cross-examined due to ex-parte 
proceedings initiated against the petitioner. In documentary evidence 
respondents produced agreement to sell along with copy of national 
identity card of the petitioner as Exh.P-1, receipt of Rs.100,000/- as 
Exh.P-2, copy of record of rights for the years 2002-03 as Exh.P-3. This 
documentary evidence also remained un-rebutted  
7. 
 
Petitioner took a specific stance that agreement to sell dated 
13.06.2002 was cancelled due to non-performance of the conditions 
because respondents failed to pay remaining consideration amount as per 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
8
terms of the agreement within time, therefore, time is essence of the 
contract. He also pleaded that in this regard he sent a notice dated 
18.09.2002 through registered envelope acknowledgement due to the 
respondents wherein he specifically asked them if they failed to pay 
remaining consideration amount within a period of two days, sale bargain 
shall be deemed to be cancelled. The petitioner failed to produce any such 
notice before the learned trial court. There is no cavil with the proposition 
that pleadings are not evidence themselves and the facts pleaded in the 
pleadings should be proved through evidence.  
8. 
 
Now question for determination is whether time was the 
essence of contract or not, same can be deciphered from the recital of 
agreement to sell between the parties. For convenience of reference, 
agreement executed between the parties on 13.06.2002 is reproduced in 
verbatim as under:-

Perusal of said agreement to sell, although it does state that 
remaining consideration amount of Rs.100,000/- was to be paid in the 1st 
week of August, 2002 and Rs.1,50,000/- was to be paid on 31.10.2002 
and in case of failure the sale bargain was to be cancelled and earnest 
money be forfeited. It is also evident from the said document that it is a 
unilateral agreement and written on behalf of the petitioner and the 
signatures/thumb impressions of respondents are missing on it.  
10. 
 
However, by now it is well-settled that what is to be 
determined in such like cases is not the form of document but the 
intention of the parties i.e. that time should be of essence of the contract.  
It is well-settled principle of law that in contracts relating to 
immovable property time is not essence of contract. In this regard the 
observation of Lord Viscound Halodone in “Jamsheed Rhoda Ram Irani 
V. Bujrgi Dhunni Bhi” (AIR 1915 Privy Council 83 at Page 85) is 
relevant, which is as under:- 
“Prima facie, equity treats the importance of each time limit as 
being subordinate to main purpose of the parties and it will 
enjoin specific performance notwithstanding that from the point 
of view of court of law the contract has and been literally 
performed by the plaintiff as regards the time limit specified.”  
 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
10
In case of “Abdul Hamid v. Abbas Bhai” (PLD 1962 Supreme 
Court 1) it has been held while interpreting Section 55 of the Contract 
Act, 1872 by the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan as under:- 
“An intention to  make time of the essence of the contract must 
be expressed in unmistakable language; it may be inferred from 
what passed between the parties before, but not after, the 
contract is made.”  
 
It was also laid down in that case that:- 
“Equity will not assist where there has been undue delay on the 
part of one party to the contract, and the other has given him 
reasonable notice that he must complete within a definite time.” 
 
In case reported as “Seth ESSABHOY versus SABOOR AHMAD” 
(PLD 1973 SC 39) the principle of law has been envisaged by the 
Honorable Supreme Court that:- 
“It is a well-settled principle of law that in contracts relating to 
immovable property, time is not of the essence of the contract, 
and the claim of the appellant, even if were accepted that he 
had given three days’ notice to the respondent for completion of 
the contract, failing which it would come to an end, cannot at 
all be considered to be reasonable time.” 
 
In case of “Ghulam Nabi and others v. Seth Muhammad Yaqub” 
(PLD 1983 Supreme Court 344) similar view was affirmed by the 
august Supreme Court.  
In case of “Muhammad Sharif v. Mst. Fauji alias Phaji through 
legal heirs” (1998 SCMR 2485) while interpreting Section 55 of the 
Contract Act (IX of 1872) the Honorable Supreme Court enunciated the 
principle to determine the time of the essence of contract of particular 
case in the following words:- 
“In order to determine whether, in relation to a particular 
contract time is, or is not of essence, intention of the parties in 
terms of Section 55 of the Contract Act is to be assessed.” 
 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
11
Further observed:- 
“Such an intention is to be gathered from the terms of contract 
itself, as translated by the conduct of the parties and attending 
circumstances. The terms themselves are to be construed with 
reference to the spirit and substance rather than the bare words 
or recitals, in a deed.” 
 
Merely an express provision in agreement specifying certain time 
limit for performance of contractual undertaking on part of 
promisee/vendee in case of sale of immovable property, would not make 
specified time as essence of contract in absence of any such specified 
intendment from construction of document of contract. In the absence of a 
provision in the agreement to sell an immovable property that the time 
fixed for performance of the contract is to be treated as the essence of 
contract, the time fixed for performance of the contract is not treated as 
the essence of contract. It was so, reiterated in “Mrs. Mussarat Shaukat 
Ali v. Mrs. Safia Khatoon and others” (1994 SCMR 2189) that mere 
mention of some period or inclusion of forfeiture clause would not have 
an effect that time is essence of contract and “delay simpliciter which is 
short of period of limitation prescribed under the law is not enough to 
disentitle a plaintiff to the relief of specific performance.” 
11. 
 
It is also matter of fact that petitioner pleaded in his written 
statement that he gave notice to the respondents on 18.09.2002 with a 
direction to pay balance consideration amount within two days and said 
notice was given after the date of first installment i.e., first week of 
August, 2002. This fact also suggest that time was not essence of contract.

The question, which of the parties was at fault in performing 
its part of agreement is a question of fact and inference can only be drawn 
from the record.  
The respondents specifically pleaded in their plaint as under:-

One of the plaintiffs while recording his statement as P.W-4 stated

Said portion was remained unchallenged. Petitioner failed to rebut 
the stance of respondents, therefore, inference can be drawn that he was at 
fault in fulfilling the agreement.  
13. 
 
There is no cavil with the proposition that where defendant 
found to have committed breach of contract, it is not obligatory on the 
part of plaintiff to prove his willingness to perform it. For reference Seth 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
13
Essabhoy judgment referred supra, whereby august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan observed as under:- 
“However, in cases where the defendant himself has committed 
breach of the contract, it is not obligatory on the complainant in a 
suit for specific performance to prove his willingness to perform it 
up to the date of the filing of the suit. In this connection, the 
observations of Lord Mansfield in Jones v. Barkley (1) may be 
usefully cited:- 
“The party must show that he was ready, but, if the other 
stops him on the ground of an intention not to perform his 
part, it is not necessary for the first to go farther and do a 
nugatory act.” 
Where the defendant definitely repudiates the contract, or commits 
breach thereof, the plaintiff is absolved from showing that he was 
ready and willing to perform his part of the contract.” 
(1) 
(178) 2 Dougl. 684 
14. 
 
The failure to perform part of contract by the date fixed in the 
agreement to sell i.e., for payment of remaining consideration amount is 
not a ground for refusing relief of specific performance unless the 
circumstances must be highlighted and proved by the owner-vendor of the 
land that time is essence of the contract. Section 55 of the Contract Act, 
1872 deals with the effects of the failure of a party to perform its part of 
the contract where time is essence of the contract and the contracts where 
the time is not the essence of the contract. For convenience of reference, 
the said provision is reproduced herein below:-:  
“Section 55. Effect of failure to perform at fixed time, in 
contract in which time is essential When a party to a contract 
promises to do a certain thing at or before a specified time, or 
certain things at or before a specified times, and fails to do any 
such thing at or before the specified time, the contract, or so much 
of it as has not been performed, becomes voidable at the option of 
the promisee, if the intention of the parties was that time should be 
of the essence of the contract.  
Effect of such failure when time is not essential---If it was not 
the intention of the parties that time should be of the essence of the 
contract, the contract does not become voidable by the failure to 
do such thing at or before the specified time; but the promisee is 
entitled to compensation from the promisor for any loss 
occasioned to him by such failure.  

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
14
Effect of acceptance of performance at time other than that 
agreed upon------If, in case of a contract voidable on account of 
the promisor's failure to perform his promise at the time agreed, 
the promisee accepts performance of such promise at any time 
other than that agreed, the promisee cannot claim compensation 
for any loss occasioned by the non-performance of the promise at 
the time agreed, unless, at the time of such acceptance he gives 
notice to the promisor of his intention to do so.”  
 
From above, it is vividly clear that intention to make time of the 
essence of the contract must be expressed in unmistakable language and it 
can be inferred from what passed between the parties before but not after 
the contract is made. A mere mention of a specified period in an 
agreement for completion of sale and payment of balance consideration 
amount would not make the time as essence of the contract unless it is 
expressly intended by the parties and the terms of the contract do not 
permit any other interpretation. This question has to be decided according 
to the intention of the parties reflecting in the agreement, its terms, 
conduct of the parties after the agreement and all the attending 
circumstances. Reliance is placed upon the case reported as “Mst. AMINA 
BIBI versus MUDASSAR AZIZ” (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 430) 
wherein it has inter alia been held as under: - 
“12.Generally speaking, specific performance of a contract of sale 
of immovable property has been granted by the Courts although 
there has been a failure to keep the dates assigned by it, if justice 
could be done between the parties and if nothing in (a) the express 
stipulation of the parties, (b) the nature of the property, or (c) the 
surrounding circumstances make it inequitable to grant the relief. 
13. It is well-settled that intention to make time of the essence of 
the contract must be expressed in unmistakable language and it 
may be inferred from what passed between the parties before, but 
not after, the contract is made. A mere mention of a specified 
period of an agreement for completion of sale has been held as not 
to make the time of essence of the contract. In contracts of sale of 
immovable property, ordinarily, time is not considered to be the 
essence of the contract unless it was expressly intended by the 
parties and the terms of the contract do not permit of any other 
interpretation.” 
 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
15
Similarly, in case of “MUHAMMAD HUSSAIN  and others versus. 
Dr. ZAHOOR ALAM” (2010 SCMR 286) the issue, under discussion, was 
clinched in the following manner:- 
“In the contract relating to immovable property time is not 
generally the essence of the contract in the failure to perform part 
of the contract by the date fixed in the agreement to sell i.e. for 
execution of sale deed is not a ground for refusing specific 
performance unless the circumstances must be highlighted and 
proved by the owner of the land that time is essence of the 
contract in view of the law laid down by this Court in various 
pronouncements. See Abdul Hamid’s case (PLD 1962 SC 1) Seth 
Essabhy’s case (PLD 1973 SC 39).” 
 
Likewise, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled 
“MUHAMMAD ABDUR REHMAN QURESHI Versus SAGHEER 
AHMED” (2017 SCMR 1696) while interpreting that whether time is 
essence of the contract in the real estate transactions held as under : - 
“It must be interpreted and applied specifically considering the 
facts and circumstances of each case to balance equities, keeping 
the standards of reasonability in mind and ensuring that injustice 
is not done to either side.”  
 
If the question as to whether the time was essence of the 
agreements entered between the parties is adjudged on the touchstone of 
the afore-referred judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court there leaves 
no ambiguity that according to the recitals of agreement to sell (Exh.P-1), 
the respondents were to pay balance consideration amount in two 
installments. In this background, it can safely be concluded that the time 
was not essence of the contract. 
15. 
 
There is no cavil with the proposition that it is not incumbent 
upon the Court to decree every suit for specific performance if the 
circumstances of the case require otherwise. As far as the case in hand is 
concerned, despite addressing the Court at length, learned counsel for the 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
16
petitioner has not been able to convince me with solid reason as to why 
the suit of the respondents could not be decreed. It is admitted proposition 
that on the one hand the petitioner received Rs.100,000/- from the 
respondents in part performance of the contract and on the other hand 
retained the possession of the suit property which fact also stands proof of 
the fact that the petitioner was not ready to perform his part of the contract.  
16. 
 
It is relevant to note that Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act, 
1877 deals with discretion to grant of decree for specific performance. 
The said provision is reproduced herein below:- 
“22. Discretion as to decreeing specific performance.—The 
jurisdiction to decree specific performance is discretionary, and 
the court is not bound to grant such relief merely because it is 
lawful to do so; but the discretion of the court is not arbitrary but 
sound and reasonable, guided by judicial principles and capable 
of correction by a court of appeal. 
The following are cases in which the Court may properly exercise 
a discretion not to decree specific performance: 
(I) 
Where the circumstances under which the 
contract is made are such as to give the 
plaintiff an unfair advantage over the 
defendant, though there may be no fraud or 
misrepresentation on the plaintiff’s part. 
(II) 
Where the performance of the contract would 
involve some hardship on the defendant 
which he did not foresee, whereas its non-
performance would involve no such hardship 
on the plaintiff. 
(III) 
Where the plaintiff has done substantial acts 
or suffered losses in consequence of a 
contract capable of specific performance.” 
 
A perusal of above-quoted provision shows that grant of decree for 
specific performance is discretionary in nature and such discretion should 
be justly exercised. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case 
reported as “Mrs MUSSARAT SHAUKAT ALI versus Mrs. SAFIA 
KHATOON and others” (1994 SCMR 2189) highlighted the principles for 
grant of decree for specific performance in the following words: - 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
17
“It is true that grant of relief of specific performance is 
discretionary with the Court but this discretion cannot be 
exercised arbitrarily. The relief of specific performance being an 
equitable relief, it can be refused by the Court only if the equities 
in the case are against the plaintiff. The Court while refusing to 
grant a decree for specific performance to a plaintiff must find 
something in the conduct of plaintiff which disentitled him to the 
grant of equitable relief of specific performance, or the Court 
reaches the conclusion that on account of delay in seeking the 
relief, the circumstances have so materially changed that it would 
be unjust to enforce the agreement specifically. The specific 
performance of a contract cannot be refused merely – because it is 
lawful for the court to refuse it. Section 22 of the Specific Relief 
Act, though not a exhaustive provides some instances in which the 
specific relief of a contract may be refused by the Court in its 
jurisdiction.” 
 
It was further held in “LIAQAT ALI KHAN and others versus 
FALAK SHER and others” (PLD 2014 Supreme Court 506) that— 
“A plain reading of above reproduced statutory provision leads to 
a definite conclusion that the role of specific performance claimed 
by respondents Nos.1 to 4 in their suit is, purely discretionary in 
nature and the court is not bound to grant such relief merely as it 
is lawful to do so. At the same time, the discretion to be exercised 
by the court shall not be arbitrary, but it should be based on sound 
and reasonable analysis of the relevant facts of each case, guided 
by judicial principles and capable of correction by a court of 
appeal. Moreover, in sub-paragraphs Nos.i, ii and iii of section 22 
(ibid) some instances have been given, wherein the court can 
refuse to exercise its discretion to pass a decree for specific 
performance. A careful reading of these instances, which are self-
explanatory, further amplify vast powers of the court in the matter 
of exercise of its discretion for ordering specific performance or 
otherwise. When the above reproduced provision of law is read in 
conjunction with the case law cited at the Bar by both the learned 
Senior Advocate Supreme Courts, the things as regards powers of 
the Court in exercising its discretion, became even more clear that 
there is no two plus two, equal to four formula available with any 
court of law for this purpose, which can be applied through cut 
and paste device to all cases of such nature. Conversely, it will be 
the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case, particularly, 
there terms of the agreement between the parties, its language, 
their subsequent conduct and other surrounding circumstances, 
which will enable the court to decide whether the discretion in 
terms of section22(ibid) ought to be exercised in favour of specific 
performance or not. Besides, some well articulated judgments on 
the subject, have further broadened the scope of exercise of such 
discretion of the Court by way of awarding reasonable 
compensation to the parties, keeping in view the other 
surrounding circumstances, such as rate of inflation, having direct 
bearing the value of suit property, inordinate delay/passage of 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
18
time, and change in the circumstances or status of the subject 
property etc.” 
 
Moreover, the issue, under discussion, has elaborately been dealt 
with in case of “Mrs. ZAKIA HUSSAIN and another versus Syed 
FAROOQ HUSSAIN” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 401) in the following 
manner: - 
“It is time and again held by this court that specific performance 
of a contract is essentially an equitable and discretionary relief 
and the court seized of the matter is in a better position to decide 
and resolve not simply according to the spirit of the law but also 
in accordance with the principles of substantial justice by keeping 
in mind peculiar facts and circumstance of each case. It cannot be 
claimed as a matter of right. The discretion to be exercised by the 
court requires that it should not be arbitrary but should be sound 
and reasonable guided by judicial principles and capable of 
correction by a court of appeal. Such an exercise of grant or 
refusal of relief would depend on the facts and circumstances of 
each case  and also the conduct of the parties.” 
 
17. 
 
It is relevant to note over here that discretionary relief cannot 
be denied to a litigant, who otherwise is vigilant always ready and willing 
to perform his part of obligation, merely because his lis remained pending 
for many years in the court. Increase of price of the property during the 
time when causes remain pending in courts, not ipso facto disentitles the 
purchaser to seek discretionary relief of specific performance. Rise in the 
price of the property may be relevant factor in denying the relief of 
specific performance, keeping in view the conduct of the vendee, date of 
agreement of sale, time agreed to performance and time of filing of the 
suit before trial court. In the present case, time for performance of the 
agreement to sell was 31.10.2002, respondents instituted their suit for 
specific performance on 06.01.2003 just after two months and six days 
and deposited the balance sale consideration in terms of the order passed 
by the court despite the fact that they were not in possession of the suit 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
19
property. The said fact alone is sufficient to prove bona fide of the 
respondents towards performance of their part of the contract. 
18. 
 
Now, I would like to take up the objection of limitation. This 
civil revision was filed on 28.05.2009 against judgment and decree, dated 
21.02.2009 passed by the learned lower appellate Court after the expiry of 
96 days. The petitioner submitted copy form for obtaining the certified 
copies on 10.04.2009. Copy was prepared and collected on the same day 
i.e., 10.04.2009. The petitioner filed an application (C.M.No.1734 of 
2009/BWP) under sections 5 & 12 of the Limitation Act, 1908 for 
extension of time/condonation of delay on 17.06.2009. In his application 
for condonation of delay, the petitioner took a ground that he remained 
seriously ill, admitted in Hospital where his Hernia operation was 
conducted and doctor advised him for complete bed rest for three months. 
Said application is without any supportive evidence. The petitioner was 
supposed to file the revision petition within a period of 90 days but the 
same having been filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation, 
therefore, was barred by the law of limitation. Although petitioner moved 
said application (C.M.No.1734 of 2009/BWP) on 17.06.2009 but he did 
not press as neither any notice was issued to the respondents nor it was 
admitted for hearing. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case 
reported as “PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through District Officer Revenue, 
Rawalpindi and others versus MUHAMAMD SARWAR” (2014 SCMR 
1358) while dealing with the fate of time barred revision petition has inter 
alia held as under: - 
“The second proviso thereto in unambiguous terms lays down 
the period of limitation for applying to the Court by mentioning 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
20
that all other statutory provisions prescribing time period in 
which a matter is to brought before the Court the second 
proviso to section 115(1), C.P.C. to be applied with the same 
vigour. Thus, where an aggrieved party seeks redressal against 
the Judgement or order through the revisional powers of the 
Court under section 115, C.P.C. he has ninety days to make the 
application, failing which the application is liable to be 
dismissed.” 
 
It is also relevant to mention that if Statute governing proceedings 
does not prescribe period of limitation then proceedings instituted there 
under would be governed by Limitation Act, 1908 but where law under 
which proceedings have been instituted prescribes period of limitation 
then benefit of section 5 of the said Act cannot be availed unless the same 
had been made applicable as per section 29(2) of the Limitation At, 1908. 
Sections 5 and 29 of the Limitation Act, 1908 reads as under: - 
S.5: Extension of period in certain cases: Any appeal or 
application for a revision or a review of judgment or for leave 
to appeal or any other application to which this section may be 
made applicable by or under any enactment for the time being 
in force may be admitted after the period of limitation 
prescribed therefore, when the appellant or applicant satisfies 
the Court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the 
appeal or making the application such period.” 
 
29. Savings: (1) Nothing in this Act shall affect section 25 of 
the Contract Act, 1872. 
(2). Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, 
appeal or application, a period of limitation different from the 
period prescribed thereto by the First Schedule, the provisions 
of section 3 shall apply, as if such period were prescribed 
therefore in that schedule, and for the purpose of determining 
any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or 
application by any special or local law- 
 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
21
(a) 
the provisions contained in section 4, sections 9 
to 18 and section 22 shall apply only in so far as, 
and to the extent to which, they are not expressly 
excluded by such special or local law; and 
 
(b) 
the remaining provisions of this Act shall not 
apply.” 
 
(3): Nothing in this Act shall apply to suits under Divorce Act, 
1869 (IV of 1869) 
(4): Sections 26 and 27 and the definition of “easement” in 
section 2 shall not apply to cases arising in territories to which 
the Easement Act, 1882, may before the time being extend.” 
 
Insofar as the case in hand is concerned, Section 5 of the Limitation 
Act, 1908 is not applicable in the light of Section 29(2) of said Act, as 
Section 115 of C.P.C. itself prescribes 90 days for filing a revision 
petition, therefore, provision of section 5 of the Limitation Act was not 
available for condonation of delay or extension of time. Reliance is placed 
upon “ALLAH DINO and another versus MUHAMMAD SHAH and 
others” (2001 SCMR 286) wherein it has inter alia been held as under: - 
“There is no cavil with the argument that if the Statute 
governing the proceedings does not prescribe period of 
limitation, the proceedings instituted thereunder shall be 
controlled by the Limitation Act as a Whole. But where the law 
under which proceedings have been launched prescribes itself a 
period of limitation like under section 115, C.P.C. then benefit 
of section 5 of the Limitation Act cannot be availed unless it has 
been made applicable as per section 29(2) of the Limitation 
Act.” 
 
In this regard reliance is also placed upon “CITY DISTRICT 
GOVERNMENT, LAHORE through District Coordination Officer, Lahore 
versus, Mian MUHAMMAD SAEED AMIN” (2006 SCMR 676), “Begum 
Syeda AZRA MASOOD versus Begum NOSHABA MOEEN and others” 
(2007 SCMR 914), “PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through Collector and 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
22
others versus MUHAMAMD FAROOQ and others” (PLD 2010 Supreme 
Court 582) and “HAFEEZ AHMAD and others versus CIVIL JUDGE, 
LAHORE and others”(PLD 2012 Supreme Court 400). Therefore, the 
application filed by the petitioner under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 
1908 was not maintainable and is dismissed. 
19. 
 
The limitation is not a mere technicality and once it expires, 
the right accrued in favour of the other side by operation of law cannot 
lightly be taken away. Reliance is placed on “ASAD ALI and 9 others 
versus The BANK OF PUNJAB and others” (PLD 2020 SC 736) wherein 
it has been held as under: - 
“It is settled law that limitation is not a mere technicality (or a 
hyper technicality as it had been termed by the Tribunal). Once 
limitation expires, a right accrues in favour of the other side by 
operation of law which cannot lightly be taken away.” 
 
20. 
 
It is well entrenched by now that delay defeats equity and the 
favors the vigilant and not the indolent. Learned counsel for the petitioner 
failed to satisfy this Court regarding the late filing of the revision petition. 
Therefore, this Civil Revision is also liable to be dismissed on the point of 
limitation.  
21. 
 
So far as the case-law referred by the learned counsel for the 
petitioner is concerned, suffice it to note that the same is not applicable to 
the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case.  
22. 
     
 I have not seen any illegality, irregularity and mis-reading or 
non-reading of evidence on the part of learned appellate Court while 
passing the impugned judgment and decree. The findings of the learned 
appellate Court on question of facts and law having based upon proper 

Civil Revision No.618-D of 2009/BWP. 
23
appreciation of oral as well as documentary evidence produced in the suit 
are not open to any interference.  
23. 
 
The epitome of above discussion is that instant Revision 
Petition is without any merits and substance, hence, the same is, hereby 
dismissed with no order as to cost.
