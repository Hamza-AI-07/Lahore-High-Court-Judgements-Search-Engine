to Rigorous Imprisonment for 09-years with fine of Rs.80,000/-
and in default thereof, to further undergo S.I for 04-months. Benefit 
of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. was also extended to the appellant.

Briefly, as per case of prosecution narrated in the Crime Report 
(F.I.R./Ex.PB/1) got recorded by Saif Ullah, A.S.I. (complainant/PW-1),                 
on 17.10.2022, on spy information appellant was apprehended by the 
complainant and other police officials; on his personal search, from a 
blue coloured shopper holding in his right hand, two packets of charas 
wrapped with yellow coloured tape along with computerized scale were 
recovered from his possession; each packet was found weighing       
1000-grams; out of the recovered charas, samples were separated and 
secured while remaining case property of charas was also sealed into 
separate parcels; all parcels were prepared with the stamps “S.U.”; upon 
further search, amount of Rs.4700/- as sale proceed and mobile phone 
were also recovered from possession of the appellant and taken into

possession along with aforesaid parcels vide recovery memo Ex.PA; for 
ready reference, relevant portion of the Crime Report (F.I.R./Ex.PB/1) is 
hereby scanned below:- 
 
After investigation, challan report was sent to the Court against 
the appellant; charge was framed against him, to which he pleaded not 
guilty; prosecution produced its evidence; trial court recorded statement 
of the appellant under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. wherein he refuted 
allegations leveled against him; appellant did not record his statement 
under Section: 340(2) Cr.P.C. to disprove the allegations levelled against 
him and also did not produce any evidence in his defence; then trial 
court after hearing learned counsel for the parties, passed the impugned 
judgment, whereby the appellant was convicted and sentenced as 
mentioned above. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that safe custody 
of the case property has not been proved; therefore, conviction recorded 
and sentence awarded through impugned judgment are liable to be set-
aside; finally requested for acceptance of instant appeal. 
4. 
Conversely, learned Deputy Prosecutor General has supported the 
impugned judgment and requested for dismissal of instant appeal.

5. 
After hearing learned counsel for the appellant, learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General and going through the record with their 
able assistance, it has been noticed that Saif Ullah, ASI (complainant of 
the case) while appearing as PW-1 during trial of the case stated that on 
18.10.2022, Moharrar handed over to him seven sealed parcels including 
two parcels of samples in this case for onward transmission to Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore whereas remaining five parcels for 
transmission to Malkhana Saddar, Chiniot, he deposited aforementioned 
two parcels of samples at the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore on 20.10.2022; in this regard, relevant portion of his statement is 
reproduced as under: - 
“On 18.10.2022, Moharrar handed over to me seven 
sealed parcels i.e. two said to contain sample of chars for onward 
transmission to PFSA Lahore and two said to contain remaining 
chars, one said to contain electric weighing scale, one said to 
contain sale proceed Rs.4700/- and one said to contain mobile 
phone for onwards transmission to Malkhana Saddar Chiniot. On 
19.10.2022, I deposited five sealed parcels i.e. two said to contain 
remaining chars, one said to contain electric weighing scale, one 
said to contain sale proceed Rs.4700/- and one said to contain 
mobile phone to Ghulam Abbas ASI incharge Malkhana Saddar 
Chiniot. On 20.10.2022, I deposited two sealed sample parcels 
of chars at PFSA, Lahore. Investigation officer recorded my 
statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. in this regard on 20.10.2022.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  (emphasis added) 
 
Any plausible, convincing, valid and cogent reason for keeping both 
parcels of samples in this case with him from 18.10.2022 till 20.10.2022 
and not depositing the same on 18.10.2022 or 19.10.2022 in the office of 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore is not discernible from the 
record. It is also relevant to mention here that if for any reason 
whatsoever, said parcels of samples could not be deposited on 
18.10.2022 or 19.10.2022, then it was mandatory for Saif Ullah, ASI 
(PW-1) to return the same to the Moharrar of the Police Station on 
18.10.2022 or on 19.10.2022 for keeping the same in safe custody and 
then to re-collect said parcels of samples from Moharrar on the day of 
their deposit in the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency i.e. 
20.10.2022 but any such exercise has not been done by him as very 
fairly conceded by learned Deputy Prosecutor General after going 
through entire record.

Aforementioned state of affairs straightaway leads to the conclusion 
that chain of safe custody of both parcels of samples has been compromised 
and not established/proved in this case.  
  
It has also been noticed that while examining the appellant as 
accused under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. during trial of the case, it was not put 
to him that who handed over case property at the place of recovery to 
whom for taking the same to the Police Station, who brought case 
property from place of recovery at the Police Station and handed over to 
whom for keeping the same in safe custody and who brought case 
property in safe custody at the Police Station, therefore, chain of            
“safe custody” of the “parcels of remaining  case property” as well as 
of the “parcels of the samples” has not been put to the appellant under 
Section: 342 Cr.P.C. hence same cannot be used against him. For 
recording conviction and awarding sentence in a criminal case, it is 
mandatory to put entire incriminating material to the accused under 
Section: 342 Cr.P.C. in order to have his explanation/reply in said regard 
otherwise it would amount to “audi alteram partem” and in this regard, 
case of “AMEER ZEB versus THE STATE” (PLD 2012 Supreme 
Court 380) can be safely referred and its relevant portion from Paragraph 
No.6 available at Page No.398, is hereby reproduced for ready reference:- 
“It is trite that a piece of evidence not put to the accused person at 
the time of recording of his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C. 
cannot be used against him by the prosecution.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      (emphasis added) 
In this regard, guidance has also been sought from the case of                  
“ABDUL HAYEE and ABDULLAH alias GHAZALI and another”                       
(2025 SCMR 281) and relevant portion of the same from Paragraph No.14 is 
hereby reproduced as under:-   
“14.  Insofar as the recoveries of weapons of offence from the 
petitioners in another case bearing FIR No. 121 dated 
26.05.2009 under Sections 324/353/186/148/149 P.P.C., read 
with Section 13 of the Arms Ordinance, 1965 and Section 7 of the 
Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, at Police Station Mochh, District 
Mianwali, which recoveries were also relied upon by the 
prosecution in the instant case and positive reports of Forensic 
Science Laboratory are concerned, we have noted that the said 
recoveries were not put to the petitioners in their statements 
recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C., therefore, the above-
mentioned pieces of prosecution evidence cannot be considered 
against the petitioners and the same have rightly been discarded 

Crl. Appeal No.71368-J/2023

by the learned High Court in paragraph No. 15 of the impugned 
judgment. Reference in this context may also be made to the 
cases of, Fida Hussain Shah v. The State (2024 SCMR 1622), 
Haji Nawaz v. The State (2020 SCMR 687) and Mst. Anwar 
Begum v. Akhtar Hussain (2017 SCMR 1710). 
 
Similarly, case of “OBAIDULAH and 2 others versus The STATE 
and others” (2025 SCMR 1558) can be advantageously referred on the 
subject. So, when chain of safe custody of parcels of samples as well as 
parcels of remaining case property has not been put to the appellant 
during his examination under Section: 342 Cr.P.C., then the same cannot 
be used against him and when it cannot be used against the appellant 
then it i.e. said safe custody would be deemed as not proved against the 
appellant. Now law is well settled on the point that unbroken chain of 
safe custody of “allegedly recovered case property and parcel of sample” 
is to be proved otherwise, conviction is not possible and it is rightly so 
because recovery of narcotics is not a mere corroboratory piece of 
evidence rather it constitutes the offence itself and entails punishment. 
Guidance in this regard has been sought from the cases of “The STATE 
through REGIONAL DIRECTOR ANF versus IMAM BAKHSH” 
(2018 SCMR 2039), “ABDUL GHANI and others versus The 
STATE and others” (2019 SCMR 608), “MUHAMMAD HAZIR 
versus The STATE” (2023 SCMR 986), “ASIF ALI and another 
versus The STATE through Prosecutor General Punjab” (2024 
SCMR 1408), “SARFRAZ AHMED versus The STATE” (2024 
SCMR 1571) and “MUHAMMAD IQBAL versus The STATE 
through P.G. Sindh” (2025 SCMR 704). Since safe custody of the 
parcels of samples taken out of the recovered substance has not been 
proved in this case therefore report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore (Ex.PD) is inconclusive and cannot be made basis for conviction. 
By now it is also well settled that if safe custody of allegedly recovered 
substance or parcel of sample/case property has not been proved then, 
there is no need to discuss other merits of the case and it straightaway 
leads to the acquittal of the accused; in this regard, guidance has been 
sought from the supra cases of “ABDUL GHANI and others versus The 
STATE and others” and “The STATE through Regional Director ANF 
versus IMAM BAKHSH”.

6.   
It is trite law that single dent in case of prosecution is sufficient for 
acquittal, in this regard, reliance can be placed upon the cases of 
“MUHAMMAD MANSHA versus The STATE” (2018 SCMR 772), 
“ABDUL 
JABBAR 
and 
another 
versus 
The 
STATE”                      
(2019 SCMR 129), “Mst. ASIA BIBI versus The STATE and others” 
(PLD 2019 SC 64) and “AMIR MUHAMMAD KHAN versus The 
STATE” (2023 SCMR 566), “MUHAMMAD NAWAZ and another 
versus 
The 
STATE 
and 
others” 
(2024 
SCMR 
1731) 
and 
“MUHAMMAD BILAL versus The STATE” (2025 SCMR 1580). 
 
7. 
Nutshell of the above discussion is that prosecution has been 
failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond shadow of doubt 
hence there is no need to discuss defence version.   
8. 
In view of all above, instant appeal is allowed/accepted, 
conviction recorded and sentence awarded to the appellant through 
impugned judgment dated: 20.07.2023 passed in case arising out of F.I.R 
No.1150/2022 dated: 17.10.2022 registered under Sections: 9(1) 3(c) and 
15 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 at Police Station: 
City Chiniot, District Chiniot, are hereby set aside; he is acquitted of the 
charge and will be released from jail forthwith if not required in any 
other case.
