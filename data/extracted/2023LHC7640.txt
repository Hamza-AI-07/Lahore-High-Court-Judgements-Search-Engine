Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – This revision petition is directed 
against the judgment and decree dated 11.04.2013 passed by the Additional 
District Judge, Minchinabad, whereby he set aside the civil court’s 
judgment and decree dated 18.07.2012 through which it had dismissed the 
declaratory suit of the Respondent/Plaintiff (Raj Bibi). 
2. 
 
On 02.10.2007, the Respondent instituted a declaratory suit 
against the Petitioner/Defendant, Khushi Muhammad, her real brother, in 
the civil court at Minchinabad. She stated that she inherited agricultural 
land measuring 29 kanals 05 marlas in Mauza Bhagwanpura, Tehsil 
Minchinabad (the “Suit Property”) from her father, Ramzan, vide Mutation 
No.94 dated 11.04.1977. This property was part of a joint Khata and 
remained undivided. According to the Respondent, the Petitioner was a co-
sharer in the Khata, cultivated the Suit Property from the beginning, and 
shared the produce with her. In 2007, when she approached the Halqa 
Patwari for the partition of the joint Khata to secure exclusive possession 
of her share, she discovered that the Suit Property had been transferred to 
the Petitioner by way of Tamleek through Mutation No.141 on 11.03.1987 
(Exh. P-2 and Exh.D-16) (the “Impugned Mutation”). The Respondent 
alleged that this mutation was fraudulent because she had never gifted him

the Suit Property. She professed ignorance regarding the entire process, 
adding that she had not appeared before any revenue authority for the 
transfer, had not affixed her thumb-mark on any document, and had not 
handed over possession of the Suit Property to the Petitioner. She 
contended that Mutation No. 141 was ab initio void and inoperative against 
her rights. Finally, the Respondent asserted that the Petitioner had 
concealed the Impugned Mutation, and she only became aware of it on 
24.09.2007. Thus, her suit was timely. 
3. 
 
The Petitioner contested the suit, raising preliminary 
objections that it was time-barred and not maintainable in the present form. 
On the merits, he submitted that the Respondent remained in possession of 
the Suit Property for ten years after inheriting it and then sold it to him for 
Rs.12,000/-. On 04.02.1987, she appeared before the Halqa Patwari and got 
the transaction recorded in Roznamcha Waqiati vide Rapt No.163  
(Exh. D-13), which was verified by the Girdawar on 09.02.1987. 
Thereafter, she appeared before the Revenue Officer and had her statement 
recorded, reaffirming the transaction and acknowledging the receipt of the 
sale consideration. She also delivered possession of the Suit Property to 
him in the presence of witnesses. Consequently, the Revenue Officer 
attested Mutation No.141 on 11.03.1987. The Petitioner asserted that the 
Suit 
Property 
was 
recorded 
in 
his 
name 
in 
the 
Jamabandi  
(Record-of-Rights) from 1987 onwards. He has been in possession since 
the date of its purchase and enjoying it to the exclusion of the Respondent. 
4. 
 
The Civil Judge framed issues from the divergent pleadings of 
the parties, after which they produced evidence in support of their 
respective claims. The Respondent/Plaintiff, Raj Bibi, personally appeared 
in the witness box as PW-1, while Muhammad Abbas son of Muhammad 
Hussain testified as PW-2, Muhammad Ashraf son of Shabbir Ahmad as 
PW-3, Haji Qadir Bakhash son of Bahadur as PW-4. The Respondent again 
appeared as PW-5 in rebuttal and submitted documentary evidence 
comprising certified copies of Inheritance Mutation No.94, and the 
Impugned Mutation No. 141 (Exh.P-1 & Exh.P-2). In defence, Rana 
Mushtaq Ahmad Patwari took the witness stand as DW-1, while 
Petitioner/Defendant Khushi Muhammad testified as DW-2, Muhammad 
Ali son of Muhammad Hanif as DW-3, and Abdul Jabbar son of Charagh 

Civil Revision No. 295-D/2013

Din as DW-4. The Petitioner tendered documents Exh.D-1 to Exh.D-17 in 
documentary evidence. 
5. 
 
The Civil Judge dismissed the Respondent’s suit through 
judgment and decree dated 18.07.2012. He held that her claim was time-
barred and legally incompetent, being technically defective. On merits, the 
Civil Judge ruled that Mutation No.141 was valid and that the Petitioner 
had not committed any fraud against the Respondent. 
6. 
 
The Respondent appealed. The Additional District Judge 
determined that the Respondent’s suit was not barred by limitation. She 
approached the court within the time specified in Article 120 of the 
Limitation Act, 1908 (the “Limitation Act”). On the factual aspect, he 
concluded that the Respondent had proved that Mutation No.141 was a 
result of fraud. Besides, it was not sustainable because it was approved 
without following the mandatory procedure prescribed by Section 42(7) of 
the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1967 (the “1967 Act”). The Respondent’s 
appearance before the Revenue Officer at the relevant time, as required by 
law, was also not established. As a result, the Additional District Judge 
overturned the civil court’s ruling through his judgment and decree dated 
11.04.2013. 
7. 
 
In support of this revision petition, Mr. A.R. Aurangzeb, 
Advocate, contended that the Respondent’s suit was not maintainable 
because she sought a declaration that Mutation No.141 was a nullity 
without simultaneously praying for possession of the Suit Property, which 
was admittedly with the Petitioner. He further contended that the 
Respondent’s suit was barred by time. The Impugned Mutation No.141 was 
attested on 11.03.1987, while she filed the suit on 02.10.2007, i.e., after 
20½ years. On the factual aspect, Mr. Aurangzeb argued that the 
Respondent had failed to prove that the Petitioner had committed fraud 
with her and usurped the Suit Property. According to him, Mutation 
No.141 was sanctioned after due process, and the Additional District Judge 
had erred in reaching a different conclusion. 
8. 
 
Mr. Muhammad Khalid Shahid Buttar, Advocate, vehemently 
opposed this petition. He contended that Mr. Aurangzeb’s objection 
regarding the maintainability of the Respondent’s suit on the alleged legal 
defect was based on a misconception of the law. He also refuted the plea 

Civil Revision No. 295-D/2013 
 
 
 
- 4 - 
that the Respondent’s suit was barred by limitation. He argued that 
Mutation No.141 was void as it was processed in violation of section 42(7) 
of the 1967 Act. No limitation period runs against a void mutation entry. 
On facts, Mr. Buttar argued that the Petitioner was a pardanashin woman, 
and the law provided her with special protection. A heavy burden lies on 
the Petitioner to prove any alienation of the Suit Property to him, which he 
failed to discharge. The Petitioner claimed that he had purchased the Suit 
Property from the Respondent but had not proved it, while the Respondent 
established through reliable evidence that she had been defrauded. She 
never appeared before the Revenue Officer to confirm any transaction with 
the Petitioner regarding the Suit Property. In this regard, Mr. Buttar 
particularly referred to the testimony of Rana Mushtaq Ahmad Patwari 
(DW-1), who conceded that the Respondent’s attendance was not recorded 
in the Revenue Officer’s orders dated 08.02.1987 and 11.03.1987. He 
submitted that the Additional District Judge’s judgment and decree were 
based on the correct appreciation of law and facts and prayed that the same 
may be affirmed. 
9. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. 
10. 
 
The Petitioner and the Respondent are real brother and sister. 
Their father, Ramzan, passed away in 1977, upon which the Respondent 
inherited the Suit Property as per Inheritance Mutation No.94 dated 
11.04.1977 (Exh.P-1). The Petitioner claims to have acquired it from her 
vide Sale Mutation No.141 dated 04.02.1987, which is impugned in these 
proceedings. Both parties presented certified copies of Mutation No.141 as 
evidence during the trial. The Respondent’s document is Exh.P-2, while 
that of the Petitioner is Exh.D-16. 
11. 
 
At the very outset, it is necessary to point out that, as per  
Exh. P-2 and Exh. D-16, Mutation No.141 was a sale mutation  
(based on oral sale). However, throughout the proceedings, starting from 
filing the plaint, the Respondent referred to it as Tamleek. It appears that 
she was misled by a clerical mistake in Tatima Shajra. Considering that the 
Respondent has questioned the validity of Mutation No.141 essentially on 
the grounds that it has been attested in contravention of the law and that it 
is fraudulent and without consideration, this has no bearing on the fate of 
the case. 

Civil Revision No. 295-D/2013 
 
 
 
- 5 - 
12. 
 
Let’s begin with the legal objections. The first is that the 
Respondent’s suit is legally flawed. According to the Petitioner, she should 
have filed a suit seeking a declaration of title to the Suit Property plus 
possession, but she applied for a declaration simpliciter. This objection 
deserves short shrift because the Suit Property is situated in a joint Khata. 
It is trite that no limitation runs against a co-sharer/co-owner.1 Every  
co-sharer/co-owner is presumed to be in possession of every inch of the 
joint property unless it is partitioned.2 The following excerpt from Khalid 
Hussain and others v. Nazir Ahmad and others (2021 SCMR 1986), 
eloquently explains the law: 
 
“As far as not seeking possession of the disputed property is concerned, 
the record is clear that no reliable evidence was adduced by the 
respondents to prove their exclusive possession thereof. No independent 
evidence, worthy of credence, was produced by the respondents to prove 
the factum of transfer of possession of the disputed property to them 
under the Gift Deed. In fact, there is a clear finding of the trial court that 
the possession of the disputed property remained under the control of 
Muhammad Din till his death, and further that the same was being 
cultivated by the tenants, as later correctly confirmed by the appellate 
court. Even otherwise, the petitioners claim themselves to be the co-
owners of the disputed property with the respondents, having inherited 
the same from their father. The possession of one co-owner is 
considered, in law, to be the possession for and on behalf of all the co-
owners. Thus, the suit of the petitioners in its form and content was 
maintainable and competent under the law.” 
13. 
 
In view of the above, I hold that the Respondent’s civil suit is 
competent under the law, even though she has not prayed for possession 
while seeking a declaration of her title to the Suit Property.  
14. 
 
The Petitioner’s second objection is that the Respondent’s suit 
is time-barred. Section 18 of the Limitation Act addresses this issue. It 
states that if a person entitled to institute a suit or submit an application 
has, by means of fraud, been kept from the knowledge of such right or the 
title on which it is founded, or if any document necessary to establish such 
right has been fraudulently concealed from them, the time limit for filing a 
suit or application (a) against the person guilty of the fraud or accessory 
thereto, or (b) against any person claiming through them otherwise than in

good faith and for valuable consideration, shall be computed from the time 
when the fraud first became known to the person injuriously affected 
thereby. In the case of the concealed document, the computation starts 
when the person first gains the means to present it or enforce its 
production. In Mst. Rabia Gula and others v. Muhammad Janan and 
others (2022 SCMR 1009), the Supreme Court ruled that section 18 of the 
Limitation Act delays the onset of the limitation period for filing a lawsuit 
when fraudulent means prevent a person from knowing their right. This 
provision causes the limitation period, mentioned in the Schedule, to 
commence from a distinct time than specified. 
15. 
 
Generally, the time limit for filing a suit for declaration is six 
years under Article 120 of the Limitation Act. However, in  
Khan Muhammad through L.Rs. and others v. Khatoon Bibi and others 
(2017 SCMR 1476), recognizing potential variations in certain categories 
of cases, the Supreme Court provided detailed guidelines on this matter. It 
stated: 
“In the cases of simple correction of revenue record, it is settled by now 
that every fresh wrong entry in the record of rights would provide a fresh 
cause of action provided the party aggrieved is in possession of the 
property as owner needless to say that it can be either physical or 
symbolic possession. Similarly, in the cases of claiming right of 
inheritance, it is well settled that the claimant becomes co-owner/co-
sharer of the property left by the predecessor along with others the 
moment the predecessor dies, and entry of mutations of inheritance is 
only meant for updating the revenue record and for fiscal purposes. If a 
person feels aggrieved by such entries, he can file a suit for declaration 
within six years of such wrong entries or knowledge. Any such repetition 
of the said entries in the revenue record would again give him a fresh 
cause of action, or when the rights of anyone in the property are denied it 
would also give a fresh cause of action. Similarly, it is again settled by 
now that no limitation would run against the co-sharer … In recent past 
certain judgments have been rendered in the cases of inheritance wherein 
the question of waiver, acquiescence and estoppel have been considered 
…” 
16. 
 
In the present case, the Respondent testified that she learnt 
about Mutation No.141 on 24.09.2007 when she approached the Halqa 
Patwari with her son, Muhammad Ashraf (PW-3), for partition of Khata. 
The latter corroborated her. However, the Petitioner neither cross-examined 
the Respondent nor Muhammad Ashraf on this aspect. Under the law, a 
 

Civil Revision No. 295-D/2013 
 
 
 
- 7 - 
 fact is deemed to have been admitted if it is not cross-examined.3 
Considering that the Respondent filed the suit against the Petitioner on 
02.10.2007, i.e., eight days from the date when she gained knowledge 
about the Impugned Mutation, her suit was on time. 
17. 
 
Mr. Aurangzeb contends that the Respondent’s assertion that 
she learnt about Mutation No.141 on 24.09.2007 is false. He submits that 
the Petitioner has produced certified copies of Mutation Nos. 139, 140 and 
142 (Exhibits D-14, D-15 and D-17) through which Sakina Bibi and Zainab 
Bibi (Respondent’s real sister and mother respectively) transferred their 
inherited properties to the Petitioner. These three mutations, along with the 
Impugned Mutation No. 141 Exh. P-2/D-16, were recorded by the Patwari 
collectively on 04.02.1987 and presented to the Revenue Officer in the 
common assembly on 08.02.1987. The Revenue Officer attested Mutation 
Nos. 139, 140 and 142 but deferred the Impugned Mutation No. 141. 
According to Mr. Aurangzeb, Sakina and Zainab never challenged their 
transactions. He argues that in this scenario, Respondent should be deemed 
to have knowledge of the proceedings before the revenue staff.  This 
contention is unfounded. There is no proof that she was with Sakina and 
Zainab when the Patwari documented Mutation Nos. 139, 140 and 142 on 
04.02.1987, whereas it is a proven fact that she did not present herself 
before the Revenue Officer on 08.02.1987 when he attested them. Legal 
cases cannot be decided on assumptions. 
18. 
 
Mr. Aurangzeb submits that consolidation proceedings were 
conducted in Mauza Bhagwanpura in 1989-90 during which the 
Petitioner’s ownership of the Suit Property was included in a separate 
Wanda. He argues that the Respondent admitted this fact during her cross-
examination as PW-5. If she had a claim, she would have challenged the 
consolidation proceedings. I am afraid I cannot endorse this argument. The 
Respondent’s aforementioned admission does not necessarily imply that 
she was aware that the Suit Property had been transferred to the Petitioner, 
and there was nothing in her name.

Ghulam Muhammad and others (PLD 2004 SC 633), Khan Muhammad through L.Rs. and others v. Mst.

others (2021 SCMR 1158), Mst. Rabia Gula and others v. Muhammad Janan and others  
(2022 SCMR 1009), and Ghulam Rasul and 4 others v. Muhammad Hanif (1980 CLC 1611).

19. 
 
As adumbrated, the Respondent alleges that she has been 
defrauded. It is the Supreme Court’s consistent view that limitation never 
runs against fraud, more so in the matters involving inheritance rights of a 
female. Reliance is placed on Shabla and others v. Jahan Afroz Khilat 
and others (2020 SCMR 352).4 
20. 
 
Now, I turn to the facts of the case. The pivotal question is 
whether Mutation No.141 has been attested in accordance with the law. 
Section 42 of the 1967 Act prescribes the procedure for preparing records 
relating to land owners. Its relevant part is reproduced below for ease of 
reference: 
42. 
Making of that part of periodical records which relates to 
land-owners. – (1) 
Subject to the other provisions of this Chapter, a 
person acquiring by inheritance, purchase, mortgage, gift, or otherwise, 
any right in an estate as a land-owner, or a tenant for a fiscal term 
exceeding one year, shall, within three months from the date of such 
acquisition, report his acquisition of right to the Patwari of the estate, 
who shall– 
(a) 
record such report in the Roznamacha to be maintained in 
the prescribed manner; 
(b) 
furnish a copy of the report so recorded, free of cost, to 
the person making the report; and 
(c) 
send a copy of the report, within a week of its receipt by him, 
to the office of the Union Administration within which the 
estate is situated. 
(2) 
If the person acquiring the right is a minor or is otherwise unable to 
report, his guardian or other person having charge of his property shall 
make the report to the Patwari. 
(3) 
The Patwari shall enter in his register of mutations every report 
made to him under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), and shall also make an 
entry in the Roznamcha and in the register of mutations respecting the 
acquisition of any such right as aforesaid which he has reason to believe to 
have taken place, and of which report should have been made to him under 
either of those sub-sections and has not been so made. 
(4) 
… 
(5) 
… 
(6)  
A Revenue Officer shall, from time to time, inquire into the 
correctness of all entries in the register of mutations and into all such 
acquisitions as aforesaid coming to his knowledge of which, under the 
foregoing sub-sections, report should have been made to the Patwari and 
entries made in that register, and, shall in each case make such order as 
he thinks fit with respect to any entry in the periodical record of the right 
acquired.  
(7)  
Except in cases of inheritance or where the acquisition of the 
right is by a registered deed or by or under an order or decree of a Court, 
                                          
4 The Supreme Court drew on the following decisions for this ruling: Fazal Ellahi deceased through legal 
heirs v. Mst. Zainab Bi (2019 SCMR 1930), Khan Muhammad through L.Rs and others v. Mst. Khatoon 
Bibi and others (2017 SCMR 1476), Mahmood Khan v. Syed Khalid Hussain Shah (2015 SCMR 869),  
Mst. Gohar Khanum v. Mst. Jamila Jan (2014 SCMR 801), Rehmat Ullah and others v. Saleh Khan and 
others (2007 SCMR 729), Arshad Khan v. Resham Jan and others (2005 SCMR 1859) and Ghulam Ali 
and others v. Mst. Ghulam Sarwar Naqvi (PLD 1990 SC 1).

the Revenue Officer shall make the order under subsection (6) in the 
presence of the person whose right has been acquired, after such person 
has been identified by two respectable persons, preferably from 
Lambardars or members of the Zila Council, Tehsil Council or Town 
Council concerned whose signatures or thumb impressions shall be 
obtained by the Revenue Officer on the register of mutations.  
(8) 
An inquiry or an order under sub-section (6) shall be made in the 
common assembly in the estate to which the mutation, which is the 
subject matter of the inquiry, relates. 
(9) to (11) 
… 
21. 
 
Courts have considered section 42 of the 1967 Act in several 
cases. In Gharib Shah and others v. Zarmar Gul (PLD 1984 SC 188), the 
Supreme Court emphasized the significance of sub-section (8) of section 42 
of the 1967 Act, stating that an effective order must be made only in the 
“common assembly” of the estate to which the mutation relates. The 
Supreme Court rejected the contention that the vendors’ statement recorded 
under sub-section (6) is sufficient to close proceedings without complying 
with sub-section (8). 
22. 
 
In Hakim Khan v. Nazeer Ahmad Lughmani and others 
(1992 SCMR 1832), the Supreme Court ruled that the provisions of section 
42 of the 1967 Act are mandatory. The legislature has used the word 
“shall,” which imposes a binding duty on the revenue staff to adhere to its 
provisions. The Supreme Court clarified that non-compliance by the 
revenue staff with these provisions does not invalidate the transactions 
covered by mutations. It emphasized that the attestation of mutations 
primarily serves the purpose of updating records for fiscal purposes and 
does not confer title to the transferee. If a dispute arises about transactions 
or related mutations, the parties involved must prove the transactions, 
following the provisions of the law of evidence. Consequently, whether 
section 42 is considered mandatory or directory, it does not directly impact 
the transactions themselves. The provisions are intended to prevent fraud. 
The Supreme Court explained: 
 
“The departure from the above provisions is apparently made to avoid 
fraud and therefore the obtaining of the signatures of identifying 
witnesses has been made essential so that in the event of their denial the 
parties concerned may be in a position to prove their signatures. The 
provision regarding the attestation of mutations in the estate has also 
been made for this very purpose as normally many people of the village 
are present on the date of attestation of mutation for which prior 
publicity is made and the chances of impersonation, fraud or collusion 
are very rare. According to sub-section (6) of section 42, the Revenue 
Officer is required to inquire into the correctness of all entries in respect 
of mutations and under sub-section (7) he is to make his inquiries in the 

Civil Revision No. 295-D/2013 
 
 
 
- 10 -
presence of the person whose right has been acquired, after such person 
has been identified by two respectable persons, preferably from 
Lambardars or members of the Union Committee, Town Committee or 
Union Council concerned, whose signatures or thumb-impressions shall 
be obtained by the Revenue Officer on the register of mutations. Under 
sub-section (8), an inquiry is to be made in the area of the estate in which 
subject-matter of the mutation is situated.” 
23. 
 
In Khalil Ahmad v. Abdul Jabbar Khan and others  
(2005 SCMR 911), the Supreme Court held that the act of entering a 
mutation or reporting the acquisition of any right in an estate to the Patwari 
is a mere ministerial task, devoid of the power to confer or extinguish any 
right in any property. Consequently, its significance is minimal. Section 42 
of the 1967 Act does not mandate any witnesses or respectable individuals 
to accompany the person reporting the acquisition to the Patwari or witness 
the entry of a mutation in this context. Therefore, it holds no consequence 
regarding the validity of a subsequently attested mutation, whether the 
witnesses or the individual whose right is acquired personally goes to the 
Patwari. What is crucial is the actual attestation of the mutation, a process 
that the Revenue Officer must undertake under section 42(7) of the 1967 
Act. This attestation occurs in the presence of the individual whose right 
has been acquired, identified by at least two respectable persons, preferably 
chosen from the Lamberdar or members of the Union Council, etc. 
24. 
 
In Rehmatullah and others v. Saleh Khan and others  
(2007 SCMR 729) the Supreme Court reiterated that mutation must be 
recorded in the presence of parties with their consent or upon notice to 
them. 
25. 
 
The principle of law that emerges from the above precedents 
is that mutation does not confer any title. It primarily serves the purpose of 
updating records for fiscal purposes. Despite its limited role, mutation 
plays a crucial role in preventing fraud by protecting the owner’s 
proprietary rights and securing the rights of the vendee/transferee once 
attested. Section 42(7) of the 1967 Act imposes mandatory requirements 
for the attestation of mutations. The failure of the revenue staff to comply 
with the provisions of section 42 does not invalidate the transactions 
covered by mutations. If a dispute arises, the parties involved must 
substantiate transactions according to the law of evidence. 
26. 
 
In the present case, the Respondent allegedly visited the 
Patwari on 04.02.1987 and, in the presence of two witnesses, Muhammad 

Civil Revision No. 295-D/2013 
 
 
 
- 11 -
Suleman and Lal Muhammad, had Rapt No.163 (Exh.D-13) recorded in 
Roznamcha Waqiati regarding the sale of the Suit Property to the 
Petitioner. On the same day, the Patwari recorded Mutation No.141. 
According to the Petitioner, on 08.02.1987, it was presented before the 
Revenue Officer in a communal gathering in the presence of Muhammad 
Suleman and Lal Muhammad aforesaid, who affixed their signature/thumb 
impression on the Tatima Field Book. However, the matter was adjourned 
for the deposit of government dues and finally, on 11.03.1987, the mutation 
was approved. There is no record of the Respondent’s presence before the 
Revenue Officer on 08.02.1987 and 11.03.1987. Thus, the procedural 
requirements outlined in section 42(7) of the 1967 Act were not complied 
with.

Mr. Aurangzeb vehemently contended that the entry in Rapt 
No. 163 (Exh. D-13) in Roznamcha Waqiati adequately fulfilled the 
requirements of section 42 of the 1967 Act. Regrettably, it does not. The 
Supreme Court considered this issue in Muhammad Akram and another v. 
Altaf Ahmad (PLD 2003 SC 688) and held: 
“Learned trial court has categorically determined with reference to every 
detail provided in section 42 of the Land Revenue Act that the two 
mutations of exchange in Villages Bhaini (District Multan) and Karor 
(District Layyah) were attested in utter violation of provisions of section 
42 of the Land Revenue Act ... Entry in Roznamcha Waqiati alone is not 
the only requirement of section 42 of the Land Revenue Act. Numerous 
other steps were also to be necessarily taken …” 
28. 
 
In Bashir Ahmad Khan and others v. Ghulam Sadar-ud-Din 
and others (2012 CLC 699), the High Court analyzed the consequences of 
an entry made in violation of section 42 of the 1967 Act, determining it to 
be void and nullity in the eyes of the law. 
29. 
 
When a mutation is challenged, the party relying on it must 
prove the original transaction and establish its legitimacy. In Muhammad 
Akram and another v. Altaf Ahmad (PLD 2003 SC 688), the Supreme 
Court stated that “this oft-repeated principle of law is quite logical because 
a mutation is merely an evidence of some original transaction between the 
parties that had been struck somewhere prior to entry of a mutation.” 
30. 
 
In Phul Peer Shah v. Hafeez Fatima (2016 SCMR 1225), the 
Supreme Court reaffirmed that mutation alone cannot prove the transaction. 
It must be independently substantiated through cogent, reliable, and

convincing evidence. Specifically, in cases involving an elderly, illiterate, 
and pardanashin lady, the onus of proving its legitimacy lies on the party 
asserting it. This burden can only be discharged if, inter alia, the following 
are established: 
“(i) 
That the lady was fully cognizant and was aware of the nature of 
the transaction and its probable consequences; 
(ii) 
That she was having independent advice from a reliable 
source/person of trust to fully understand the nature of the 
transaction; 
(iii) 
That witnesses to the transaction are such, who are close relatives 
or fully acquainted with the lady and were having no conflict of 
interest with her; 
(iv) 
That the sale consideration was duly paid and received by the 
lady in the same manner; and 
(v) 
That the very nature of transaction is explained to her in the 
language she understands fully and she was apprised of the 
contents of the deed/receipt, as the case may be.”5 
31. 
 
Similarly, in Abdul Aziz v. Mst. Zaib-un-Nissa and others 
(PLD 2022 SC 504), the Supreme Court ruled that determining whether a 
lady is pardanashin or illiterate is fundamentally a question of fact. The 
burden of proof rests upon the person asserting any right under any deed or 
document signed or affixed with a thumb impression by a pardanashin or 
illiterate lady, voluntarily and consciously. The court must be meticulous in 
such matters. It should be satisfied with clear evidence that the said 
document was executed by her or by a duly constituted attorney appointed 
by her with a complete understanding and intelligence regarding the nature 
of the document. The Supreme Court underscored that pardanashin ladies 
have historically been granted protection, rooted in social conditions that 
have kept them virtually isolated from the broader world, leading to an 
imperfect understanding of it. The underlying rationale of this rule is to 
shield 
these 
women 
from 
potential 
deception, 
duress, 
and 
misrepresentation. The Supreme Court also cited with approval the 
following excerpt from an Indian case reported as Mst. Kharbuja Kuer v. 
Jang-Bahadur Rai and others (AIR 1963 SC 1203): 
“The rule evolved for the protection of pardahnashin ladies shall not be 
confused with other doctrines, such as fraud, duress and actual undue 
influence, which apply to all persons whether they be pardahnashin 
ladies or not.” 
                                          
5The above view was reaffirmed in Abdul Aziz v. Mst. Zaib-un-Nissa and others (PLD 2022 SC 504).

and others v. Saleh Khan and others (2007 SCMR 729), Fazal Ellahi (deceased) through his legal heirs 
v. Mst. Zainab Bi (2019 SCMR 1930), and Ghulam Muhammad v. Zohran Bibi and others  
(2021 SCMR 19).

In the present case, the Respondent is an illiterate 
pardahnashin lady. The Petitioner has failed to establish that the 
parameters outlined by the Supreme Court in Phul Peer Shah, supra, were 
met. Specifically, there is a lack of evidence proving that the Respondent 
willingly entered into the alleged sale transaction with him, obtained 
independent advice from a reliable person and that the sale consideration 
was duly paid to her and she received it. 
33. 
 
Notably, the Petitioner claims that he purchased the Suit 
Property from the Respondent for Rs.12,000/- but has not stated when and 
where the deal was finalized. He did not give these details in his written 
statement or during his testimony before the trial court as DW-2. In 
Muhammad Nawaz and others v. Sakina Bibi and others (2020 SCMR 
1021), the Supreme Court held: 
“We note that the defendants in the suit neither mentioned the date, time, 
place or names of the witnesses in whose presence the oral gift was made 
in their written statement nor in the evidence produced by them before 
the trial Court. Even otherwise, they could not have improved up on their 
case set up in the written statement in their evidence on the principle of 
‘secundum allegata et probata’, meaning, a fact must be alleged by a 
party before it is allowed to be proved.  
34. 
 
The Petitioner relies on Rapt No.163 (Exh. D-13) to establish 
the transaction with the Respondent. According to the Rapt, the 
Respondent purportedly made an oral statement before the Patwari in the 
presence of two witnesses, Lal Muhammad and Suleman, her cousins, that 
she had sold the Suit Property to the Petitioner, received the sale 
consideration of Rs.12,000/- and delivered him the possession. The Rapt 
records that the witnesses confirmed these facts and identified the 
Respondent. 
35. 
 
Roznamcha Waqiati does not form a part of the record of 
rights. Consequently, in Sattar Muhammad and others v. Hussain and 
others (PLD 1988 Peshawar 48), the High Court emphasized that no 
presumption of correctness attaches to the entry made in it. “Such an entry 
is, therefore, to be proved, especially when the same is to be used against 
the subsequent purchaser, in the same manner as any other fact is proved.” 
The Supreme Court approved this view in Zulfiqar and others v. Shahdat 
Khan (PLD 2007 SC 582).

The Petitioner has failed to prove even the authenticity of Rapt 
Exh. D-13. During the trial, he did not produce Lal Muhammad and 
Suleman in court or seek permission to present secondary evidence if they 
were unavailable. Instead, he only presented Rana Mushtaq Ahmad Patwari 
(DW-1), who stated that he recorded Rapt No.163 on 04.02.1987. 
However, during cross-examination, he admitted that he was giving 
testimony without the original records before him. He deposed that he was 
testifying on the basis of an attested copy of the mutation supplied by the 
Petitioner’s counsel. Additionally, the said copy was not issued or certified 
by him but by the Patwari then in office. He confirmed that neither the 
Petitioner paid money to Respondent nor the latter received it in his 
presence. In Rehmatullah and others v. Saleh Khan and others (2007 
SCMR 729), the petitioners failed to substantiate that they had paid the sale 
price to the original owner. Consequently, the Supreme Court held that no 
valid sale had taken place in the eyes of the law. 
37. 
 
The Petitioner claims that the Respondent affixed her thumb 
impression on Rapt No.163 Exh. D-13 in token of its correctness. Mr. 
Aurangzeb has highlighted out that while appearing as PW-5, the 
Respondent stated during her cross-examination that it could be possible 
that her thumb impression was affixed when she was sleeping in the house. 
I have thoroughly considered this matter. The Respondent’s aforesaid 
statement does not constitute an admission on her part that she thumb-
marked Rapt No.163. 
38. 
 
Having reappraised the evidence, I have reached an 
ineluctable conclusion that the Additional District Judge has rightly 
decreed the Respondent’s suit. This petition has no merit and is, therefore, 
dismissed with costs.
