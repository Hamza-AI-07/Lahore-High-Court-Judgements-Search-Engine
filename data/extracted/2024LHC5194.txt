Mr. Rashid Imran Chohan, learned counsel for the 
revision-petitioners.  
  
 
  
Through the present revision-petition, filed 
under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure-1908 
(the ‘Code’), the revision-petitioners have challenged 
judgment and decree dated 06.09.2024 passed by 
learned Additional District Judge, Kasur as well as 
judgment and decree dated 29.06.2022 passed by 
learned Civil Judge, Kasur. 
2.  
 
The predecessor-in-interest of revision 
petitioners No. 1A to 1E (the ‘petitioner’) instituted suit 
dated 09.04.2013 (the ‘suit’) for specific performance of 
agreement dated 26.08.1988 (the ‘agreement’) and 
possession of the property measuring 10-marlas, as 
further detailed in the suit (the ‘suit property’). The suit 
was contested by respondents No. 2 to 18 and out of the 
divergent pleadings as many as seven (07) issues were 
framed. Thereafter, the parties led their respective 
evidence. The learned trial Court gave issue-wise 
findings and vide judgment and decree dated 29.06.2022 
dismissed the suit. The said judgment and decree was 
assailed in Civil Appeal No. 35 of 2024, which was 
dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 06.09.2024 
by the learned Appellate Court. Aggrieved from the 
same, present revision-petition has been filed.  
3.  
 
Mr. Rashid Imran Chohan, learned counsel 
for the revision-petitioners has pressed this civil revision 
on the ground that (i) learned two Courts below have not 

 
 
 
                     C. R. No. 65806-2024                                                    2 
 
 
correctly appreciated the record and (ii) presumption 
arising under Article 100 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order-
1984 (‘QSO 1984’) has been applied from the date of 
institution of the suit instead of date of production of the 
agreement (i.e. 14.11.2019) before the learned trial 
Court and if the thirty (30) years are calculated from its 
execution till production then the presumption is 
squarely applicable.  
4.  
 
Heard. 
5.  
 
It is averred in the suit that Charagh Din 
and Bagh Ali sold the suit property to the petitioner vide 
the agreement and promised to transfer the suit property 
after redemption of mortgage charge from Zarai Tarqiati 
Bank. The suit for specific performance was instituted 
after twenty-five (25) years of the agreement. It is 
admitted position that Bagh Ali and Charagh Din both 
have passed away but somehow in the suit or 
examination-in-chief of petitioner’s witnesses even the 
date of death of Charagh Din and Bagh Ali is not 
specified. It came to the surface during cross-
examination of PW-2 that Charagh Din and Bagh Ali 
died about thirty (30) years prior to recording of the 
evidence. There is hardly any justification available for 
instituting the suit after such a long delay from the 
agreement and decades after the death of the alleged 
seller. The names of the marginal witnesses are given in 
the agreement but even those alleged witnesses have 
passed away.  
6.  
 
Muhammad Yaseen (PW-4) claimed that he 
is son of one of the marginal witnesses and he was with 
his father at the time of execution of the agreement. 
However, in cross-examination he could not even 
depose as to the date of the agreement and then he stated 
that he cannot remember the names of the persons who 

 
 
 
                     C. R. No. 65806-2024                                                    3 
 
 
have given their thumb impressions on the agreement. 
The evidence led by the petitioner is not coherent or 
confidence inspiring so that it can be said that they have 
discharged the onus to prove any fact that they asserted.  
7.  
 
Now coming to the second part of the 
arguments of Mr. Rashid Imran Chohan, who stated that 
the period of thirty (30) years for presumption under 
Article 100 of QSO 1984 is to be calculated till the date 
when the agreement was brought on record, however, 
the learned trial Court reckoned this period up-till 
institution of the suit. From the plain reading of Article 
100 of QSO 1984 it looks that thirty (30) years are to be 
taken on the date when a document is produced from 
any custody. Article 100 of QSO 1984 is identical to 
section 90 of the Evidence Act-1872 (the ‘Act’), which 
came under consideration of this Court in “Bahadar and 
Others Versus Sohna and Another”1 case, wherein it 
was concluded that this section refers to production of 
document. In “Surendra Krishna Roy and another 
Versus Mirza Mahammad Syed Ali Mutawali and 
Others”2 case the Privy Council expressed the opinion 
that under section 90 of the Act, the period of thirty (30) 
years is to be reckoned, not from the date upon which 
deed is filed in the Court but from the date on which, it 
having been tendered in evidence, its genuineness or 
otherwise becomes the subject of proof. In my opinion 
the learned trial Court fell to error while reckoning the 
period up-till filing of the suit. However, this error has 
no bearing on the result of the case, keeping in view the 
facts of the case and the evidence led by the parties. 
Article 100 of QSO 1984 provides …. which the Court

and 1980 CLC 216 SC (AJ&K)).   
 

 
 
 
                     C. R. No. 65806-2024                                                    4 
 
 
in the particular case  considers proper, the Court may 
presume….. This article clearly gives discretion to the 
Court to apply presumption keeping in view the 
particular case.  
8.  
 
It is also settled that the Court to presume 
the signatures and every other part of such document 
which purports to be in the handwriting of any person 
and that it is executed by the person by whom it purports 
to be executed Courts should be very careful about 
applying any presumption under Article  100 of QSO 
1984 in favour of old documents when the same are 
produced during the trial of a suit, in which the 
proprietary rights are set up and the Courts in its 
discretion can refuse to apply presumption where 
evidence in proof of the document is produced and then 
it is disbelieved. Reference can be made to the cases 
titled “Ch. Muhammad Shafi Versus Shamim Khanum”3 
and “Yousuf Versus Muhammad Akbar and Others”4. 
The word ‘may’ used in Article 100 of QSO 1984 
signifies that presumption envisaged therein does not 
follow as a matter of course.5   
9.  
 
The learned two Courts below have 
disbelieved the evidence of the petitioner. I have 
carefully gone through the record and found that the 
evidence of the petitioner is not credible. Therefore, this 
civil revision is dismissed in limine. No order as to 
costs.
