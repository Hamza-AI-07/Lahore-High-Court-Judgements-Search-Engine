This Court aims to resolve the issues of long-standing 
recovery of debt liability and complex legal problems to 
achieve purposive justice in this execution petition as well as 
in Execution Petitions No. 02 of 2024, 03 of 2024 and 02 of 
2010 on behalf of the Banks, i.e. (1) Askari Bank Limited 
and (2) First Women Bank Limited (the “decree-
holder/Banks”) against Khawaja Flat Glass Industries (Pvt.) 
(the “judgment-debtor/ company”). This exercise will be 
accomplished through a legal heuristic approach to resolve 

2 
 
 
            Execution Petition No.01 of 2024 
 
 
the commercial/banking disputes and the legal problems by 
the Court based on practical judgments rendered therein 
which provide three general perspectives in law i.e. 
Purposiveness, Justice and Legal Certainty under the 
prevailing Laws including Section 19 of the Financial 
Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (the 
“Ordinance”); Rules 3 and 4 of the Financial Institutions 
(Recovery of Finances) Rules, 2018 (the “Rules”); Order 
XXI Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; the 
Corporate Restructuring Companies Act, 2016; the 
Corporate Rehabilitation Act, 2018; and the High Court 
Rules and Orders Volume-V. In this approach, the Court acts 
as loco parentis taking on a protective and supervisory role 
to ensure the proper resolution of the commercial and 
banking debt disputes, while safeguarding the rights and 
interests of all parties involved. 
2. 
The Heuristic Approach is a legal framework for 
solving legal problems that has been developed with the 
judicial anthology of the “Five R’s” methodology i.e. (1) 
Recovery 
(2) 
Restructure 
(3) 
Renewal/Revival 
(4) 
Resurrection and (5) Resolution through mediation. This 
methodology is based on practical experience, knowledge, 
and quick fixes to resolve debt recovery issues in a timely 
manner in compliance of the judgment passed by the Hon’ble 
Mr. Justice Yahya Afridi of the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
(now the Chief Justice of Pakistan) reported as “FIRST 
DAWOOD INVESTMENT BANK LTD. versus BANK OF 
PUNJAB through President, Lahore” (PLD 2022 SC 769) 
wherein it has been held that the debt is substantially 
disputed, then to continue with the winding up proceedings 
would be an abuse of process of the court. This Court is 

3 
 
 
            Execution Petition No.01 of 2024 
 
 
adopting the approach of revival/restructuring of the 
Company in accordance with the principle enunciated in the 
judgment delivered by Hon'ble Justice Ayesha A. Malik of 
the Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as “Messrs. KHALID 
SIRAJ TEXTILE MILLS LIMITED LAHORE and others 
versus ADDITIONAL REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES, 
SECURITEIS AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OF 
PAKISTAN and another” (2022 CLD 1557) wherein it has 
been held that “The very fact that the SECP opted to ignore 
the revival plan reflects on their unnecessary focus on 
winding up the company rather than working on the revival 
of the company’s business. In this regard, we note that the 
SECP must protect the interests of the shareholders of the 
company and more so where the SECP seeks winding up of 
company, at its own instance. It must consider all relevant 
facts and record and if there is a chance of avoiding winding 
up then it should consider that option rather than push for 
winding up. It is in the public interest that businesses are 
encouraged. So the commercial operations of a business 
must be preserved and protected such that it is able to revive 
itself when faced with financial hardships.” This view has 
also been strengthened by this Court in the judgments 
reported 
as 
“INVESTMENT 
CORPORATION 
OF 
PAKISTAN and others Versus SUNSHINE JUTE MILLS 
LIMITED” (2005 CLD 713) and Saudi Pak Industrial & 
Agricultural Investment Company Ltd. v. Chenab Limited 
(2020 CLD 339) wherein it has been held that it is an 
admitted fact that the Company was one of the leading Unit 
in the country and its winding up will amount to economic 
death not only of the Company but also all its employees. In 
developing countries like Pakistan, the judicial forums 

4 
 
 
            Execution Petition No.01 of 2024 
 
 
should provide opportunities to the sick industries to revive 
and to restart their business at full pace and to pay off and 
settle their debts and other liabilities, especially when the 
banks are also willing to do so and have no objection to do 
so in this regard.  
3. 
Pursuant to the order dated 17.12.2024, Khawaja 
Ahmad Kamal, CEO of Khawaja Flat Glass Industries (Pvt.) 
Ltd. appeared and submitted that to resolve the issue and 
make the judgment debtor/Company a running concern, they 
are willing to settle the financial disputes with both the 
decree-holder banks by adopting the debt recovery approach 
recognized by this Court through restructuring and dispute 
resolution via mediation. Learned counsel for the decree 
holder / banks have conceded to the same.  
4. 
Learned counsel for the decree-holder banks 
unanimously consented that Askari Bank Limited shall 
assume the primary role in facilitating and supervising the 
restructuring process pertaining to both execution petitions. 
Whereupon, Mr. Ali Mohammad Khan, Group Head of 
Askari Bank Ltd. submitted that the decree-holder banks are 
unanimously prepared to devise a scheme of arrangement for 
the restructuring of the company in light of the aforesaid 
judgments and all the applicable laws. He presented their 
proposal, outlining three (03) scenarios, which reads as 
follows:  
Scenario-I 
REVIVAL 
Payable amount 
Rs.533.410 M 
immediately Due 
Remaining by 
March 2029 
Scenario-II 
RESTRUCTURING 
Payable Amount 
Rs.501.095 M 
Immediately Due 
Remaining by 
March 2029 
Scenario-III 
RECOVERY 
Payable Amount 
Rs.2,278.199 M 
Immediately Due 
 
 

5 
 
 
            Execution Petition No.01 of 2024 
 
 
He also submitted certain documents and charts detailing the 
installment dates, amounts, and previous (unsuccessful) 
proposals along with the current one, all of which are taken 
on record. He further stated that if the proposed process fails, 
the decree-holder banks will proceed against the judgment 
debtor(s) through execution proceedings under Section 19 of 
the Ordinance.  
5. 
Since the situation has been changed after the decree 
of the suit, the decree-holder/banks have shown their 
willingness to restructure the debts of the Company; in view 
of the Scheme of Arrangement, Restructuring Plan, joint 
statement and other documents submitted by the Parties; and 
the interest of the creditors, contributors and public, there 
appears to be no other option to revive/restructure the 
Company. 
6. 
At this juncture, Barrister Zulfiqar Ali Shah, Advocate 
for the judgment debtor(s)/Company alongwith Khawaja 
Ahmad Kamal, CEO of Khawaja Flat Glass Industries (Pvt.) 
Ltd. sought time to submit their undertakings supported by 
affidavit(s), along with comprehensive details of the 
mortgaged properties (whether sold or alienated) in the light 
of Chenab’s judgment of (2020 CLD 339).  
7. 
In view of above, this Court directs all parties to 
convene a meeting to discuss and finalize a mutually 
agreeable restructuring plan in the light of aforesaid 
judgment, on 10.01.2025 at 11:00 AM, with all parties and 
their representatives/counsel. To facilitate the process, this 
Court appoints Mohammad Ahmad, Advocate High 
Court, Lower Ground Floor (CK), Ali Plaza, Plot 1-E, F-6/4, 
Jinnah Avenue, Blue Area, Islamabad (0321-4224870), as 
Coordinator/Mediator to supervise and assist in these 

6 
 
 
            Execution Petition No.01 of 2024 
 
 
deliberations. The parties shall work toward finalizing the 
restructuring plan and scheme of arrangement in line with the 
intentions expressed before this Court. Parties will seek 
guidance from the relevant paragraph of the aforesaid 
Chenab’s case (2020 CLD 339), which reads as under:  
34. Accordingly, in view of the above case law 
and applicable provisions of the law, particularly 
Sections of the Act and the Rules, the prayer of 
the Applicants for interim relief is accepted, and 
the Company is temporarily allowed, till the 
disposal of the main application, to resume the 
commercial operation and the Production Units 
of the Company. As per undertaking made by the 
Applicants in writing today and confirmed by 
official liquidators, production units shall be 
managed by the Ex-Management of the 
Company, including Mian Muhammad Latif (Ex-
Chief Executive Officer) and Mian Muhammad 
Naeem (Ex-Director) after consultation with the 
JOLs and the nominee of Habib Bank Limited 
(Lead Bank) in the following manners:

8. 
At this stage, Sh. Ahsan-ud-Din, ASC, appeared and 
submitted that there is another aggrieved party whose 
property has been pledged by the banks but not redeemed, 
however, sought time to file a proper application. 
9. 
It is pertinent to mention here that this Court vide order 
dated 25.03.2024 appointed Sh. Ahsan-ud-Din, ASC and 
Syed Mudassir Nazir Naqvi, Advocate as Court Auctioneer 
in Execution Petition No.02 of 2010 for auction of the 
property(s) involved in these cases. Whereupon, they 
submitted a proposed schedule of auction through C.M. 
No.449-C of 2024, which was disposed of vide order dated 
07.05.2024, in the following manner: 
This application has been filed by the Court 
Auctioneer for approval of the proposed schedule 
of auction, detail of which is given in para-6 of 
this application, alongwith related documents 

8 
 
 
            Execution Petition No.01 of 2024 
 
 
attached with this application, on the touchstone 
of the principles already settled by this Court in 
the case of Faysal Bank Limited versus Haris 
Steel Industry (Pvt.) Limited (2023 CLD 44), in 
which entire procedure regarding speedy and 
effective auction of a property has been vastly 
discussed by ignoring all the irrelevant 
objections which are also not in consonance with 
the provisions of relevant law. He submits that 
aforesaid principles have also been discussed by 
a Division Bench of this Court in the case of 
Humaira Mehboob versus Summit Bank Limited 
and others (2023 CLD 525).  
2. 
In view of the above, the proposed 
schedule of auction alongwith the related 
documents (attached with this application) is 
approved and the Court Auctioneer is allowed to 
proceed with the auction proceedings according 
to this schedule. Disposed of. 
10. 
It is also important to mention here that on 26.06.2024, 
Syed Ishtiaq Haider, ASC for decree holder bank requested 
for appointment of a Court Auctioneer to proceed with 
execution of the decree. The request was allowed and Mr. 
Ahmed Nawaz Khan, Advocate was appointed as Court 
Auctioneer at a total fee of Rs.200,000/- to be paid by the 
Decree Holder Bank for auction of the mortgaged properties 
in this Execution Petition as well as the (connected) 
Execution Petitions No.02 and 03 of 2024.   
11.

Auctioneer, submitted that he visited the site(s) of the 
judgment debtor(s) with the consent of the decree-holder 

9 
 
 
            Execution Petition No.01 of 2024 
 
 
Banks through Professional Valuers and sought time to 
submit his report. He further requested payment of his 
remuneration/fee. The decree-holder Banks are directed to 
ensure the payment of his remuneration/fee accordingly. 
12. 
In view of above, this Court shall adopt a heuristic 
legal approach to facilitate the restructuring of the judgment 
debtor company. However, in the event of failure to achieve 
a resolution, the Court shall proceed with the auction of the 
mortgaged properties to ensure expeditious recovery of the 
outstanding liabilities, without any further delay.
