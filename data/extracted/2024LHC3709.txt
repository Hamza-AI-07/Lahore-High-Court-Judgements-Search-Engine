MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.: This is an 
application filed on behalf of respondents No. 1 to 3 for a stay of 
proceedings before this Court in the main petition, invoking the 
provisions of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 (“the Act of 
1940”). 
2.  
Learned counsel for respondents No. 1 to 3 / applicants 
submits that there is an admitted principal agreement containing an 
arbitration agreement, with the parties to the proposed arbitration being 
QALCO and petitioner No. 2 on one side, and respondents No. 1, 2, and 
3 on the other. He adds that the applicants have not participated in the 
proceedings of the main petition prior to filing this application. He 
argues that this Court is empowered under Section 34 of the Act of 
1940 to refer any matter to arbitration and, moreover, the applicants 
have expressed their willingness to arbitrate; thus, the aforementioned 
provision is applicable. He maintains that disputes regarding the 
rectification of the register are arbitrable and that only if the Arbitrator 

2 
C.M. NO. 3 OF 2023 IN C.O. No. 48681 of 2023 
 
finds that rectification is required, then should the other matters return 
to this Court for adjudication. He further submits that disputes 
concerning the rectification of the register, allegations of fraud, and 
fraudulent misrepresentation are arbitrable. If such allegations are 
proven, they render the contract voidable under Section 19 of the 
Contract Act, 1872 (“the Act of 1872”), and not void ab initio under 
Section 23 of the Act of 1872. He argues that the failure to challenge 
the arbitration clause contained in the main agreement means that any 
challenge to the validity or legality of the main agreement does not 
render the arbitration clause invalid or illegal. He submits that the 
principle of kompetenz-kompetenz, i.e., the jurisdiction of the arbitrator 
to determine his own jurisdiction, is now a recognized part of Pakistani 
law. He adds that international developments in jurisprudence require 
this Court’s review of these issues to be prima facie; the actual 
determination of these issues on their merits is to be done by the 
arbitrator. In support, he has relied upon M.A. Chowdhury v. Messrs Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. and 3 others 
(PLD 1970 Supreme Court 373), Messrs Jamal Jute Baling & Co., Dacca v. Messrs M. Sarkies & Sons,

3.  
In contrast, learned counsel for the petitioners/respondents in 
this C.M. contends that the relevant parties to the disputes in the 
petition are not parties to the agreement dated 12.04.2020 or any 
arbitration clause encapsulated therein. He adds that matters for which 
Pakistani law has given exclusive jurisdiction to a special court or 
tribunal are not arbitrable. He contends that Section 46 of the Act of 
1940 has no nexus with Section 278 of the Companies Act, 2017 (“the 
Act of 2017”). He argues that no jurisdiction in respect of arbitration 
has been conferred upon this Court functioning as a Company Bench 
under the Act of 1940, the Act of 2017, or Article 175 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the 
Constitution of 1973”). He maintains that the provisions of the Act of 
2017, which confer exclusive jurisdiction over certain company-related 
matters to this Court, including the instant matter, have been given 
overriding effect—pursuant to Section 4 of the Act of 2017—over any 
contrary stipulation contained in any other law, including the Act of 
1940. As such, the instant matter cannot be referred to arbitration. He 
adds that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable under the Act of 
2017 read with the Act of 1940. He contends that the agreement dated 

4 
C.M. NO. 3 OF 2023 IN C.O. No. 48681 of 2023 
 
12.04.2020 is under challenge, and dispute does not fall within the 
scope of the arbitration clause. He argues that, in matters pertaining to 
fraud, any provision ousting the jurisdiction of the Court would be 
against public policy, and this Court is bound to address the matter 
itself. He maintains that this Court cannot allow the respondents to hide 
behind technicalities of procedural law, and that where there is a chance 
of miscarriage of justice, the Courts have always exercised jurisdiction 
instead of staying the proceedings pending before them. He argues that 
all company matters involving factual controversy should be settled by 
the Courts established under Company Law, and the Company Bench 
can frame issues and adduce oral and documentary evidence for the 
adjudication of the disputes. He relies on case law that will be referred 
to in the main body of this judgment. 
4.  
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
5.  
The main Company Petition has been filed by the petitioners 
against the alleged fraudulent transfer of their shareholding to 
respondent No. 3, i.e. Kausar Rana Resources Private Limited 
(“KRR”). They seek a declaration that the agreement dated 12.04.2020 
was never acted upon and, therefore, is void ab initio and of no legal 
effect; an investigation into the affairs of respondent No. 3; the 
disqualification of respondents No. 1 and 2 from the Board of Directors 
of the Company; and an order restraining them from selling, 
transferring, or creating any third-party interests in the shareholding, 
movable assets, and immovable assets of respondent No. 3, under 
various provisions of the Act of 2017. 
6.  
The agreement dated 12.04.2020 was principally executed 
between QALCO (Petitioner No. 1) and KRR (Respondent No. 3). 
However, Fawad Naeem Rana (MD) and Atif Naeem Rana (CEO) are 
the signatories, acting as representatives of the said companies. As legal 
entities, the companies can only enter into agreements through 
authorized representatives or nominees. The arbitration clause also does 
not reflect the intention of the parties to include the natural persons, 

5 
C.M. NO. 3 OF 2023 IN C.O. No. 48681 of 2023 
 
petitioner No. 2 and respondents No. 1 and 2, as parties to it. Moreover, 
the name of Sameen Naeem Rana (respondent No. 2), the ultimate 
beneficiary of the alleged fraudulent transfer of shares, does not appear 
anywhere in the agreement or the arbitration clause. He is a 'third-party 
beneficiary,' and thus his grievance cannot be referred to arbitration in 
the event of a dispute. For ease of reference, the arbitration clause is 
reproduced below:  
“13.  
If any dispute arises under this Agreement which cannot 
otherwise be amicably resolved between the parties, such dispute shall 
be submitted to arbitration and conclusively resolved by a single 
arbitrator appointed by mutual consent, who shall be a retired judge of a 
High Court or the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Arbitration shall be 
conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Act, 1940, or any other 
statutory modification or reenactment then in effect.” 
7.  
The submission of the applicants / respondents No. 1 to 3 in 
paragraph 13.6 of their Preliminary Written Submissions, that it is also 
possible to argue that QALCO was acting as Fawad’s agent when 
entering into the Agreement, and that KRR was acting as Atif and 
Sameen’s agent, and so the Agreement is also binding on Fawad, Atif, 
and Sameen, is contradicted by a plain reading of the text of the 
Agreement. They have not substantiated such a claim even on a prima 
facie basis. It would be a novel interpretation to treat a company that 
has purported to sign an agreement through its human agent as itself 
being the agent of such agent. The applicants/respondents have also 
argued that Fawad Naeem Rana and Atif Naeem Rana were acting as 
agents of QALCO and KRR, respectively, and that they were also 
acting in their individual capacities. These are self-contradictory and 
inconsistent pleas. 
8.  
It is well-settled that where all parties to the main petition are 
not parties to the arbitration clause, which constitutes a separate 
agreement as per well-established principles of law, bifurcation of 
judicial action cannot be allowed. This is because it will not only cause 
inevitable delay in the resolution of the dispute but can also lead to 
conflicting decisions, increased litigation costs, and harassment of the 
parties. The right to arbitrate cannot be enforced by anyone who is not a 

6 
C.M. NO. 3 OF 2023 IN C.O. No. 48681 of 2023 
 
party to the agreement containing the arbitration clause. In such 
circumstances, proceedings in the main petition cannot be stayed under 
Section 34 of the Act of 1940. A non-signatory cannot compel 
arbitration except under exceptional circumstances. In the absence of 
any contract to that effect, an agent cannot personally enforce contracts 
entered into by them on behalf of their principal, nor are they personally 
bound by them.  Reference can be made to Sukanya Holdings Pvt. Ltd 
v. Jayesh H. Pandaya & Anr. (AIR 2003 SC 2252), Gulf Iran & 
Another v. Pakistan Refinery Limited & Ors. [Sindh High Court - 
Division Bench] (PLD 1976 Karachi 1060), Hidayatullah & Ors. v. 
Shamimuddin & Ors. [Sindh High Court] (1993 MLD 993), Trading 
Corp. of Pakistan v. Universal Navigation Pvt Limited (2011 CLD 
1642), Geoffery Noel Harry Taunton-Collins v. Robert Cromie & Ors. 
[England & Wales, Court of Appeal] [1964] ALL ER 332, Messrs 
K&N International v. Messrs Motorway Operations and Rehabilitation 
Engineering (Private) Limited (2019 CLC 1613), Aktiengesellschaft v. 
Intosex (India) Limited and Ors. (AIR 1996 Karnataka 69), Pakistan 
Refinery v. Transworld Oil (PLD 1981 Karachi 15), Haji Muhammad 
Zaffar v. Muhammad Sikandar and 2 others (2000 YLR 2503) and 
Messrs M.A Nawaz & Co. (REGD.) and 5 others v. National Bank of 
Pakistan through its Regional Manager, Multan (1970 SCMR 234), 
Devon MD v. Double Medical International (Hong Kong) Limited and 
Double Medical Technology 2023 WL 8458242 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 6, 
2023) and Vingro Developers Pvt Ltd v Nitya Shree Developers Pvt Ltd 
(ARB.P. 667/2023).  
9.  
Even if the arbitration clause is assumed to be valid for the 
resolution of the dispute at hand, respondents No. 1 and 2 and petitioner 
No. 2 still cannot invoke it, as they are not parties to it. The Court may 
refuse to stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient 
reason to refer the matter to arbitration and that a substantial 
miscarriage of justice or inconvenience to the parties would occur. 
Staying proceedings under Section 34 is discretionary, not mandatory. 

7 
C.M. NO. 3 OF 2023 IN C.O. No. 48681 of 2023 
 
If the portion of the claim that falls within the scope of the arbitration 
clause is small compared to the overall claim, and essentially the same 
evidence (or at least overlapping evidence) would need to be presented 
to establish both, then the proceedings should not be stayed, even for 
the claim that may be referable to arbitration. There is no fixed rule for 
determining when a stay should be refused. Each case has different 
facts, and the decision to grant or refuse a stay depends on the specific 
facts and circumstances of each case. The Court can make an objective 
assessment and decide whether the stay of legal proceedings should be 
granted or refused. The provisions of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 
1940, imply that the Court should first examine whether the arbitration 
clause applies to the dispute. If it does, the Court must determine 
whether the nature of the dispute is such that the ends of justice would 
be better served by a decision of the Court or by the private forum 
chosen and agreed upon by the parties. Reference is made to Vertiv 
Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd and Vertiv (Singapore) v. NTG Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd 
(2021 CLC 377), Eckhardt & Company v Muhammad Hanif (PLD 
1993 Supreme Court 42), Mst. Surriya Rehman through Attorney v. 
Siemens Pakistan Engineering Company Ltd. through Chief Executive 
Officer / Managing Director and Another (PLD 2011 Karachi 571), 
and Pakistan International Airlines Corporation v. Messrs Pak Saaf 
Dry Cleaners (PLD 1981 Supreme Court 553). 
10. 
The resolution of disputes through mediation (under Section 
277 of the Act of 2017) and the referral of matters/disputes to 
arbitration (under Section 278 of the Act of 2017) are options available 
to companies. The powers to rectify the register (under Section 126 of 
the Act of 2017) and to award punishment for fraudulent entries (under 
Section 127 of the Act of 2017) lie with the Court when the rights of 
third parties are likely to be affected. Similarly, issues of oppression 
and mismanagement (under Section 286 of the Act of 2017), 
investigation into the affairs of the company (under Section 257 of the 
Companies Act), and the winding up of a company (under Sections 301 

8 
C.M. NO. 3 OF 2023 IN C.O. No. 48681 of 2023 
 
and 304 of the Act of 2017) fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
Court when the rights or interests of third parties, who are likely to be 
affected and are not parties to the arbitration agreement, are involved. 
Besides Company Law, other matters where exclusive jurisdiction has 
been conferred on a special Court or Tribunal are not arbitrable, 
especially when the rights of third parties are likely to be affected. 
Examples include summary suits under Order XXXVII CPC, banking 
recovery suits, rent matters, and suits related to mortgages., etc. 
 
 
This Court is endowed with all requisite powers under Section 
6 of the Act of 2017 to determine any and all matters which come 
before it, including any question necessary or expedient to decide for 
the rectification of the register of members of a company under Section 
126. The said provision has conferred wide-ranging powers to record 
evidence, etc. Additionally, Sections 256 and 257 of the Act of 2017 
empower the Commission and the Court respectively to investigate into 
the affairs of a company, which is a sovereign function delegated to the 
Commission and the Court and thus cannot be exercised by the 
arbitrator. 
 
 
It has been established by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan that matters involving third-party rights and factual 
controversies related to companies should be resolved by the courts 
established under company law. The Company Court has the authority 
to frame issues and admit both oral and documentary evidence for the 
adjudication of the dispute. Reliance is placed upon Mian Javed Amir v. 
United Foam Industries (Pvt) Ltd (2016 SCMR 213). In an application 
for rectification of the register, the High Court is also empowered to 
decide any questions relating to the title of any party involved and may 
generally address any issues necessary and expedient for the 
rectification of the register. Reference is made to Lt. Gen (Retd) 
Mahmud Ahmad Akhtar v. Allied Developers (Pvt) Ltd. (2022 CLD 
718). 

9 
C.M. NO. 3 OF 2023 IN C.O. No. 48681 of 2023 
 
11. 
Needless to say, there can be no dispute with the proposition 
that the existence of an agreement between the parties to refer any 
dispute to arbitration does not oust the jurisdiction of ordinary courts. 
Nor does the party asserting the existence of an arbitration agreement 
have an absolute right to a stay of the pending legal proceedings. In 
such cases, the court has the discretion to either stay or refuse to stay 
the legal proceedings, especially when the rights of third parties are 
likely to be adversely affected. This court is not inclined to address 
other questions raised by the learned counsel for the applicants as well 
as the opposing side, such as whether allegations of fraud and 
fraudulent misrepresentation in company matters are arbitrable? who 
will decide the question of arbitrability, the judge or the arbitrator or 
through the application of the principle of kompetenz-kompetenz while 
acting as a Company Bench? These issues shall be dealt with in other 
appropriate proceedings. The case law relied upon by the learned 
counsel for the applicants/respondents No. 1 to 3 is based on 
distinguishable facts and is therefore not applicable to the unique facts 
and circumstances of this case. 
12. 
In view of the above, the instant application, being devoid of 
any substance, is hereby dismissed.
