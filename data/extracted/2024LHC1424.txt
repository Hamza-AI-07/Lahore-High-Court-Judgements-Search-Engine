ASIM HAFEEZ, J.  
Petitioner seeks relief in following terms, 
“It is prayed most humbly and respectfully that this Hon‟ble Court may be 
pleased to strike down and declare that the impugned Regulation 4(7)(b) of the 
PMDC Regulation 2023 as illegal, unlawful, ultra vires, un constitutional and 
contradictory to Regulation No.2(f) as well as previous Regulations and 
legislations defining „Overseas Pakistanis‟, in order to qualify for „overseas 
Pakistani quota‟ in the MBBS admission which in fact violate their fundamental 
rights of the persons such as the petitioner enshrined under Article 4, 9, 25 and 
25-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and it is further 
prayed that this honorable court may direct the Respondents to accept the 
petitioner and other students like him in their overseas quota for the admission 
in 2023” 
 
2. 
Precise grievance against regulation 4(7)(b) of Medical and Dental 
Undergraduate Education (Admissions, Curriculum and Conduct) policy and 
Regulations 2023, (‘impugned regulation’) is that the requirement of being, „…. 

W.P. No.73273/2023. 
2
a resident of foreign country at the time of applying for admission…….‟ is 
specifically directed against Pakistani citizens, residing in Middle Eastern 
Countries and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which countries incidentally do not 
extend nationality or permanent residency to the residents therein. It is alleged 
that impugned regulation extends preference to the nationality holders of 
European and North American countries. Adds that definition of „overseas 
Pakistanis‟ is subject to frequent changes, in quick succession, on annul basis, 
which expression and application thereof is otherwise contrary to the expression 
defined in other Statutes, dealing with citizenship and registration matters. Adds 
that impugned regulation contradicts regulation 2 (f) of Medical and Dental 
Undergraduate Education (Admissions, Curriculum and Conduct) Policy and 
Regulations 2023 (‘Regulations 2023’), wherein no requirement of being a 
resident of foreign country at the time of application for admission was indicated. 
Elaborates that petitioner stayed, studied and completed education till 12th Grade 
at Saudi Arabia and equivalence certificate affirmed petitioner‟s residency at 
Saudi Arabia. Refers to report / para-wise comments submitted in proceedings, 
subject matter of W.P No.1682/2017 to emphasize that representation made is 
contrary to the mandate of impugned regulation. Lastly submits that requirement 
of being physically present in a foreign country at the time of submitting 
application is absurd and irrational condition, which was not endorsed otherwise 
by this Court while deciding Intra Court Appeal bearing ICA No.62074/2019. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel appearing for PMDC submits that admissions 
are regulated by the Commission and changes are introduced where found 
necessary to check and control potential misuse of foreign student‟s quota. Adds 
that no discrimination is intended towards Middle Eastern Countries. Explained 
that petitioner is not a foreign resident, who wants admission on foreign student 
quota, instead of contesting on open merit. Submits that judicial review 
jurisdiction is not available or exercisable to interfere in the policy domain or to 
assess rationality and plausibility of impugned regulation, drafted in exercise of 
powers conferred under parent enactment. Relies upon judgments reported as 
“SUNDAS and others.  Vs. KHYBER MEDICAL UNIVERSITY through V.C. Peshawar and 

W.P. No.73273/2023. 
3
others.” (2024 SCMR 46), “AINA HAYA. VS. PRINCIPAL PESHAWAR MODEL GIRLS HIGH 
SCHOOL-1, PESHAWAR and others” (2023 SCMR 198) and “YASIR NAWAZ and others. Vs. 
HIGHER EDUCATION COMMISSION AND OTHERS” (PLD 2021 SC 745). Adds that 
comparison with definition of overseas Pakistanis under other laws is misdirected, 
and principle of pari materia legislation is not attracted. Further submits 
Constitutional petition bearing W.P. No. 5750/2020 was declared infructuous 
upon promulgation of new enactment and no affirmative declaration was made 
with reference to Regulation 8(2) of MBBS and BDS (Admissions, House Job 
and Internship) Regulations, 2018 (as amended on 30th May 2019) (Regulations 
2019). Submits that facts of the case, subject matter of I.C.A No. 62074/2019, are 
distinguishable and otherwise having no precedential value in the context of 
present proceedings. 
4. 
Heard. Record Perused.  
  
Regulation 8(2) of Regulations 2019 bears semblance / proximity with the 
impugned regulation. No decision has been cited to show that regulation 8(2), 
ibid, was declared void and of no legal effect on the premise of being contrary to 
the parent statute or otherwise. Challenge to the constitutionality of impugned 
regulation is therefore adjudged hereunder. 
5. 
It is essential to understand the position of the petitioner vis-à-vis the 
grievance agitated and discrimination pleaded. While examining correspondence 
addressed by the petitioner to the President of Pakistan Medical Commission, 
dated December 04, 2019 – Subject: Complaint against Foreign Residency 
Requirements at the time of admission to MBBS – petitioner admits being residing 
in Pakistan, who acknowledged that he was not a foreign resident at the time of 
applying for MBBS in Pakistan. This particular stand disentitle petitioner from 
claiming admission under foreign seats quota („designated reserved seats‟). 

W.P. No.73273/2023. 
4
Advertisement for admission for the session 2023-24 required submission of 
Iqama or residence permits green card or foreign passport, to substantiate 
candidate‟s foreign residency at the time of submission of application.  Petitioner 
possessed none of the mentioned documents, hence, same is suffering from 
inherent deficiency for the purposes of seeking admission against reserved seats.  
6. 
Now I turn to examine challenge to the vires of the impugned regulation, in 
the context of discriminatory treatment towards Pakistani citizens, being residents 
of Middle Eastern Countries and Saudi Arabia. To contextualize the context, it is 
appropriate to state impugned regulation, 4(7)(b) of Regulations 2023, which 
reads as;  
(7) Self-finance and foreign quota seats. – (a) All medical and dental institutions may 
admit students on foreign seats quota upon fifteen percent of their total annual seats 
allocated by the Council purely on merit. 
(b) 
No candidate shall be eligible for foreign quota seat in the public 
and private medical and dental institutions under sub regulations (a) 
unless, he holds a permanent foreign nationality or is an overseas (being 
a Pakistani citizen permanently resident in a foreign country) Pakistani, 
and who has studied and passed HSSC 12th grade examination or 
equivalent from outside Pakistan and is a resident of a foreign country 
at the time of applying for admission and possess a certificate from the 
institution last attended to this effect. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    [Emphasis supplied] 
7. 
I have examined the impugned regulation and do not find any particular 
disadvantage / exclusion directed towards Pakistani citizens, being resident(s) of 
Middle Eastern Countries or Saudi Arabia, for the purposes of present 
controversy. One of the conditions precedent for self-finance and foreign quota 
seats is that candidate must be a resident of foreign country, at the time of 
applying for admission - this key-phrase has to be read in the context of the 
documents ought to be provided by Pakistani students residing abroad and foreign 
candidates applying for the reserved seats – details of documents are mentioned 
in the advertisement which inter alia included Iqama or Residence permit or 

W.P. No.73273/2023. 
5
green card of Foreign passport. It is evident that candidate(s) seeking admission 
against foreign seats quota must specify residency of a foreign country, at the 
time of making application. Physical presence of prospective candidate in 
Pakistan, at the time of making of application, is not a pre-requisite but what is 
required is that candidate should be the permanent resident of a foreign country, 
at the time of making application for admission. Notwithstanding, candidate‟s 
physical presence in Pakistan at the time of making application real test is 
whether same possess any of the documents, showing residency of a foreign 
country –– class of documents required are mentioned in the advertisement. 
Hypothetically speaking, a candidate, physically present in Pakistan and holding 
Overseas Identity Card, for taking care of ailing parents, can still apply for 
admission against foreign seat quota, provided same had a valid residency of a 
foreign country, at the time of making application. There is another illustration. If 
prospective candidate, having Iqama – [residency of UAE] - is on vacation in 
United States, he can apply for admission against foreign seat quota provided he 
possessed and submitted copy of valid Iqama along the application. A prospective 
candidate may not be physically present in UAE - country of Iqama - but if he is a 
resident of a foreign country, at the time of applying for admission, he is eligible 
to apply. An invalid or ineffective Iqama does not entitle said candidate to seek a 
reserved seat. Petitioner misconstrued the scope of the impugned regulation, who 
may be physical present in Pakistan but failed to show that he was resident of a 
foreign country, at the time of making of the application. Conversely, petitioner 
admits its status as Pakistani citizen, and not being resident of foreign country. 
Some material facts / dates need particular mention. Petitioner filed instant this 
constitutional petition and provided CNIC, issued on 16.02.20214 with expiry of 

W.P. No.73273/2023.

16.02.2021 – showing stay of petitioner in Pakistan. Petitioner provided copy of 
NICOP, wherein country of stay was Saudi Arabia, which card was valid till 
14.10.2020. Petitioner also provided copy of National Identity Card, issued on 
16.01.2020 with expiry of 16.01.2030, wherein country of stay was Canada – 
mere stay in Canada, in absence of proof of foreign residency, in terms of the 
documents mentioned in advertisement, is not enough to meet the requirements. 
Petitioner had no claimed that his stay at Canada meets the requirement of a 
resident of a foreign country at the time of applying for admission. Petitioner fails, 
hence, not eligible to be considered for admission against reserved seats, who can 
otherwise compete with the class of Pakistani Student on merits. 
8. 
Upon perusal of sections 10 and 12 of National DATABASE AND 
REGISTRATION AUTHORITY ORDINANCE, 2000 it is evident that National 
Identity Cards are issued to the citizens and Overseas identity cards are issued to 
a class of citizens resident abroad. Petitioner has not claimed foreign residency. 
No contradiction is otherwise pointed between impugned regulation and other 
relevant statutes.  
9. 
No contradiction is found in regulation 2(f) and impugned regulation. One 
must not lose sight of regulation 2(g), which defines foreign student. In view of 
the aforesaid petitioner, for all intent and purposes, is a Pakistani student, eligible 
to compete on general seats on merits, but ineligible for admission on reserved 
seats. Petitioner seeks advantage of his stay in Saudi Arabia, and time spent there 
in acquiring HSSC (12th grade) without fulfilling the requirement of an “Overseas 
Pakistani” (being a Pakistani citizen permanently resident in foreign country). No 
case of any discrimination or exclusion of any particular foreign country is 
plausibly made out. In recent years a sinister practice has developed that a person, 

W.P. No.73273/2023. 
7
who does not meet the requirements of any rule, throws challenge to the 
constitutionality of disadvantageous rule. This calls for disapproval. In absence of 
any defect in the constitutionality of impugned regulation, this Court finds no 
reason to judicially review the plausibility, rational and foundational basis for 
criterion for admission against foreign seat quota. No arbitrariness or perversity is 
found in exercise of discretion. The legality of regulations 8(2) of Regulations, 
2019 was not adjudged by way of judicial scrutiny – W.P No.5750 of 2020 was 
disposed of being infructuous. Argument that some concession, apparently, is 
available in terms of para-wise comments submitted in W.P No.1682/2017, is 
misconceived. Effect has to be given to the statement contained in delegated 
legislative instrument, instead of construing any concession in para-wise 
comments. Decision in ICA No.62074/2019 is not attracted. No case of 
discrimination or discriminatory application of impugned regulation is made out. 
10. 
Challenge to the legality / constitutionality of impugned regulation is 
rejected. This petition fails on merits. No order as to the costs.
