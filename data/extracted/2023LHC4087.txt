2. 
Prosecution mania conjures the appellant with strings of 
allegations as set out in complaint (Ex.PC) lodged by Abdul Jabbar 
616 Corporal, the complainant; it speaks that on 18.03.2022 during a 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022.

routine round-up, a contingent of CTD fully armed, on an official 
vehicle, when present at Akaal garh moor, Bismillah chowk, Ada 
Domala, Pasroor-Narowal Road, received an information at about 
10:10 a.m. from a stool-pigeon through WhatsApp that a person 
belonging to a banned organization “Al-Qaida”, while present at 
Sadwala Oncha Chowk, Zafarwal, Narowal Road, Tehsil and District 
Narowal is distributing banned books, magazines and stickers for 
propagation of his banned organization. On his lead, a raid was 
conducted where two persons were found present, out of whom, one 
was distributing magazines and other was the recipient, who 
succeeded to flee up, while distributor was apprehended at the spot 
who 
disclosed 
his 
name 
as 
Muhammad 
Rehmat 
Ullah 
(accused/appellant). 
On 
his 
personal 
search, 
following 
articles/documents were recovered; 
One photocopied bound set of book titled as “Shaheed Usama Sehra 
Say Samundar Tak” wrapped in blue polythene bag, already banned 
vide Notification No. SO(IS-III)6-15/2010/pt-I dated 21.08.2015; three 
magazines titled “Nawaye-Afghan Jahad” (March 2019), “Sharaq Say 
Gharb Tak” “Yeh Saleebi Jang Hai” containing hate material. Seven 
stickers of banned organization “Al-Qaida” with printed words “Al-
Qaida” on one side whereas “Kalma Tayyaba” on the other and 
underneath “Qiyam-ay-Khilafat ka aik he tareeka” (Jahad Fe 
Sabelillah). Mobile phone Realme Model-RMX-2020 along with two 
SIM Cards, found containing hate and terrorism related material; 
another mobile phone Nokia Model TA-1034 with one SIM card along 
with cash amount Rs.3200/- and one bus ticket. Complainant secured 
all above in four sealed parcels. 
3. 
After completion of usual investigation, report under section 
173 Cr.P.C. was submitted in Court against the accused/appellant. He 
was charge sheeted, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be 
tried. Prosecution during trial produced witnesses namely Azam 
Mehmood 201 Corporal, Nasir Mehmood SI, Abdul Jabbar 616 
Corporal, Shahid Mahmood 1103 Corporal, Yasir Ali 1078 Corporal, 
Nasir Mahmood Hunjra Inspector and Muhammad Azam Inspector 
who were recorded as PW-1, PW-2, PW-3, PW-4, PW-5, PW-6 and 
PW-7 
respectively. 
On 
close 
of 
prosecution 
case, 
the 
accused/appellant was examined under section 342 Cr.P.C. who 
denied the prosecution evidence, however, opted to produce in his 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
3
 
 
defence USB Ex.DA containing two clips of CCTV footage regarding 
his lifting from Madrissa but did not opt to appear in the witness box 
in terms of Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. and on conclusion of trial he was 
convicted and sentenced forecited.  
4. 
Heard. Record perused. 
5.    Prosecution side riding was on the shoulders of two witnesses of 
recovery PW-3 & PW-4 who narrated the story like one mentioned in 
the complaint/FIR. According to them, they left the Police station at 
7:00 a.m. on 18.03.2022 for roundup and took more than 3 hours & 10 
minutes to reach at Akaal garh moor at 10:10 a.m. where they 
received information about the presence of accused at Zafarwal 
Chowk; however, they rushed to the destined place where the accused 
was present. Both with little variation stated about the distance inter se 
the place of information and the recovery as 4/5 & 5/6 kilometers. It is 
observed that prosecution has not produced any rupt or proof for 
leaving of police station by the CTD team at an acclaimed time so as 
to show the purpose or destination they were going to and that too far 
away from police station. After apprehending the accused at 10:20 
a.m. they took two hours to complete all the processes at the site 
including drafting of complaint which the PW-3 specifically deposed 
as under; 
“I completed draft of complaint at 12.20 pm, I sent the same through 
Asif Iqbal 627 Corporal to Police Station for registration of FIR” 
 
It is noticed that police station was at a distance of 80 Kilometers 
from the place of recovery and FIR was registered at 1:45 p.m. within 
almost 1 hour and 25 minutes if it is presumed that said Asif Iqbal 
swiftly left the place of recovery at 12.20 p.m. but there is nothing to 
presume because Asif Iqbal Corporal did not enter appearance in the 
dock to verify the facts. We have noticed that earlier this distance of 
80 kilometers was covered by the CTD raiding team in 3 hours 10 
minutes, despite the fact they went straight to Akaal garh moor and 
did not stop anywhere as per statement of PW-3 & PW-4. In such 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
4
 
 
circumstances to know the condition of road and means of 
transportation which Asif Iqbal used for reaching to the police station, 
his testimony was essential; therefore, his nonappearance is fatal to 
the prosecution case as held in case reported as “MINHAJ KHAN Versus 
The STATE” (2019 SCMR 326). 
6.   During search of accused no material was collected which could 
label him as member of banned organization; this has been conceded 
by PW-3 & PW-4 in their depositions while stating that no 
membership card was recovered from his possession. Similarly, PW-6 
investigating officer also admitted that neither any organizational card 
was recovered nor any thing on the lead of accused. Though PW-6 
claimed to have made an attempt to join the people from the locality 
where allegedly accused was living and deposed that no one came 
forward due to his being member of banned organization; but neither 
he named any person nor statement of any such person was recorded 
in whose presence he had made such attempt. Though CDR of 
accused was also brought on record but no suspicious number was 
tracked to show his link with banned/proscribed organization. 
Investigating officer also admitted that he inspected the place of 
recovery but nothing like CCTV was found. He claimed to have 
associated the nearby shopkeepers for knowing the name of deserted 
unknown accused but no material he could collect in this respect; but 
again, name of shopkeeper was not deposed by him nor indicated a 
reference from any investigative material in this context. We are 
fortified in our view that no material was available in support of 
charge u/s 11-F (2) of Anti-terrorism Act, 1997. 
7.   Before dilating upon the main issues, it is essential to observe that 
Prosecution story for distribution or dissemination of hate material 
could not be materialized or proved through any cogent or supportive 
evidence because the recipient, probably an imaginary person, ran 
away from the scene of crime and he was imaginary in the sense that 
no person was arrested later during investigation nor was taken into 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
5
 
 
the process; therefore, imagination or presumption that appellant was 
in the pocket of that allegation is nothing but farce.  
8.    The first and foremost consideration requisite for charging 
standard of prosecution was the recovery of one banned book and 
three magazines mentioned in the complaint Exh.PC and were shown 
exhibited before the court as “P1 & P2/1-3” but the book and 
magazines are not available in the record before this court which is to 
be responded by the prosecution yet we have found that except this 
nominal information, neither the title-images of such book or 
magazines are part of record nor observation of the court that after 
seeing the original, the book and magazines were returned to the 
prosecution because of being banned or containing hate material. So 
much so no witness deposed before the court about the contents of 
such book or magazines referring any chapter or pages showing a 
cause of banning. Therefore, we simply rule out this nominal evidence 
from consideration which could not connect the appellant with 
commission of offence.  
 
9.    Learned Additional Prosecutor General raises his stance at a high 
pitch while referring that the fact of possession alone is sufficient to 
convict the accused and it is not necessary to give evidence that he 
actually disseminated the material. Confronted with the situation that 
articles recovered from the possession of accused are not available in 
the court, he responded that marking of documents as “P” clearly 
indicates that they were exhibited before the court and presumption of 
truth attaches to judicial functions under Article 129 illustration (e) of 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and further states that accused has not 
cross-examined the witness in whose evidence such articles were 
exhibited in the Court, therefore, the principle that any fact deposed 
during examination-in-chief if not cross examined by the accused 
would be presumed as admitted and proved. Carefully attended above 
contentions which require thorough response and clarification. 
  

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022.

10.     It was the case of prosecution that accused/appellant was 
apprehended at the moment when he was distributing banned books to 
an individual who ran away on seeing the CTD raiding team. From his 
search, banned book & magazines (P1 & P2/13)), stickers (P3/1-7), 
mobile phone (P4) along with SIM Cards (P5/1-2), another mobile 
(P6) along with SIM (P7), Cash (P8/1-6), Bus ticket (P9) and 
Polythene shopping bag (P10) were recovered and taken into 
possession while securing them into four sealed parcels. All these 
articles P1 to P10 are missing from the record. We have examined the 
record of trial court which is with page marking and no jump of page 
number has been observed. All other documents are available on the 
record including CDR, Chat history of mobile phone in the form of 
USB Exh. PR/1 and scanned copies which were retrieved by the 
PFSA allegedly from the mobile phones recovered from the accused; 
PFSA report is also available except documents P1 to P10. We asked 
from the learned APG for such record, he expressed his inability about 
presence of such record. Had it been available in the court it must 
have been sent to this court along with all other record. For reference 
a para from Chapter 24-B of High Court Rules & Orders Volume-III 
is referred; 
43. Exhibited articles- Exhibited articles, which are not documents 
and are not referred to in paragraphs 41 and 42 of this Chapter, should 
not be sent to the High Court, unless the High Court calls for them, or 
unless the Sessions Judge considers that a particular exhibit will be 
required in the High Court, in which case he should record a note at 
the foot of his judgment that the exhibit should be forwarded to the 
High Court in the event of an appeal. 
  
The above dictates of law requires that the documents exhibited must 
be sent to the court of appeal with records. We have observed that all 
the articles including mobile phone recovered from the accused were 
containing information, therefore, fall within the definition of 
document; however, for clarity definition of document as mentioned 
in Article 2(1)(b) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 is reproduced as 
under; 
(b) "Document" means any matter expressed or described upon any 
substance by means of letters, figures or marks, or by more than one of 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
7
 
 
those means, intended to be used, or which may be used, for the 
purpose recording that matter;  
 
Illustrations  
A writing is a document;  
Words printed, lithographed or photographed are documents;  
A map or plan Is a document;  
An inscription on a metal plate or stone is a document;  
A caricature is a document. 
  
Similarly, an electronic document as defined in Electronic Transaction 
Ordinance, 2002 means; 
 
(m) “electronic document” includes documents, records, information, 
communications or transactions in electronic form; 
 
The definition of ‘document’ in our law is the “matter expressed or 
described upon any substance” and not the substance itself, therefore 
information in the form of writing, words painted, map or plan, 
inscription or caricature etc. when appear on a substance would 
qualify to be a document which means book in bound set is not the 
document but the information therein. The word ‘document’ as a verb 
means “a process of recording the details of an event”. Articles cited 
above shown exhibited as P1 to P10 were the documents on the 
qualification of containing information supportable to prosecution 
case. But certainly, the hypothesis of mis-exhibition is stronger due to 
their non-availability in the record and mechanically marking them 
with letter “P” without clarification as to whether they were produced 
singly or in sealed parcels because as per statement of Complainant 
PW-3 that he secured all the documents/articles in four sealed parcels. 
This fact gets further strength when it is not in the evidence of any 
witness that after de-sealing said four parcels the cited articles were 
produced before the Court. Although learned trial Court has not 
forwarded the documents P1 to P10 to this Court along with the 
record but at the same time it has also not mentioned in the judgment 
that such articles are being retained by the Court at its level or to any 
other destination. Yet another fact was also observed by this Court 
that prosecution has attached a USB with the record as Ex.PR/1 
containing images of some material extracted from mobile phones of 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
8
 
 
accused which means that when USB can be sent with the record, 
documents P1 to P10 if available could have easily been tagged or 
sent with the record. We have also examined two reports u/s 173 
Cr.P.C. available in the record which according to its column No. 5 
speak about availability of case property as per details of documents 
attached with the reports. At the end of both reports in details of 
documents we have not found mentioned any of the documents like 
P1 to P10. 
 
                So far as the contention that judicial function are protected 
as having presumption of truth, suffice it to say that such presumption 
falls under Article 129 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, it says that 
‘Court may presume’ which means that it is optional with the court to 
presume or not to presume because it is not like rebuttable 
presumption as of some referred under Article 90 to 95 & 99. Such 
Articles use word “shall” for presumption of facts mentioned therein, 
therefore, if facts are not rebutted, shall be presumed as in existence. 
Presumption under Article 129 of the said Order is also not like 
irrebuttable presumptions (conclusive) as referred in Article 55 and 
128 of the said Order. We therefore, in the circumstance do not 
presume that such documents were ever produced before the learned 
trial Court. Therefore, prosecution case fails due to non-production of 
primary or secondary evidence in the form of documents in support of 
oral assertions. Prosecution has also not produced the material thing 
(mobile etc.) before the Court which was in the form of indirect 
evidence, nor trial Court required its production which is in complete 
defiance to proviso (2) of Article-71 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 which says; 
 
Provided further that, if oral evidence refers to the existence or 
condition of any material thing other than a document, the Court may, 
if it thinks fit, require the production of such material thing for its 
inspection:  
11.    As a legal challenge we turn to the contention of learned APG 
that fact of alleged non-exhibition of documents has not been 
challenged during recording of evidence, therefore, any fact if not 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
9
 
 
cross examined shall be presumed as admitted or proved. We know 
that principles of evidence in criminal matters stand at variance or at 
different premise to one applied in civil matters. In a situation like 
above, the Honourable Supreme Court has clarified the principles of 
evidence in criminal matters in a case reported as “Mst. ASIA BIBI 
Versus The STATE and others” (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 64) as 
under:- 
19. The argument of the learned counsel for the complainant that 
some factual assertions made by the prosecution witnesses were 
deemed to have been admitted by the defence because the 
prosecution witnesses were not cross-examined regarding those 
assertions and no suggestion was put to them regarding 
incorrectness of such assertions has been found by me to be 
misconceived. In the case of Nadeem Ramzan v. The State (2018 
SCMR 149) this Court had clarified while referring to the earlier 
cases of S. Mahmood Alam Shah v. The State (PLD 1987 SC 250) 
and State v. Rab Nawaz and another (PLD 1974 SC 87) that "the 
principle that a fact would be deemed to be proved if the witness 
stating such fact had not been cross-examined regarding the same 
was a principle applicable to civil cases and not to criminal cases. 
It was held that a criminal case is to be decided on the basis of 
totality of impressions gathered from the circumstances of the case 
and not on the narrow ground of cross-examination or otherwise of 
a witness on a particular fact stated by him."  
                                                                              (Emphasis supplied) 
                        
In the light of above dictum, it can safely be concluded that 
prosecution evidence is bereft of exhibition of very basic documents 
to prove the possession of same with the accused/appellant; therefore, 
when there is no hate material or the stickers of banned organization 
on the record, conviction on charges u/s 11-G, 11-W or 8/9 does not 
sustain. 
 
12.    Prosecution’s stance that if the documents were not exhibited in 
the evidence during the trial, criminal liability of accused/appellant 
can still be proved through material extracted or retrieved from mobile 
phone recovered from his possession on the day of raid. We have 
examined the material placed on record as well as PFSA report with 
respect to extraction of such material from the mobile phones; so 
much so prosecution has also attached with the record a USB 
Exh.PR/1 allegedly containing images, audios, videos, chat, call log 
etc., retrieved from the phone. This evidence cannot be used against 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
10
 
 
the accused due to the reason that images P12/1-10 retrieved from 
mobile phone were not put to the accused in his statement u/s 342 
Cr.P.C., and USB Ex.PR/1 was not played in the Court during the 
statement of any witness so as to prove its contents. We are also 
seriously concerned about extraction of data from a personal mobile 
phone, may be of an accused, without her consent; which is not a 
good practice as it opposes to constitutional guarantee of right to 
privacy and we feel that if the accused was not ready to accord 
consent, then at least permission from magistrate should have been 
taken. Though in this case, Anti-terrorism Court supervised the 
processes of investigation whenever needed but we have not found 
any such permission in the record nor Learned APG has shown the 
same to us, therefore, retrieval of data from mobile phone of 
accused/appellant by PFSA without the consent of accused amounts to 
self-incrimination prohibited under Article-13 of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, therefore, such evidence is 
ruled out from consideration.  
 
13.   Extracting information from a personal phone of accused during 
a criminal process is a serious issue which attracted our attention to 
examine the law on the subject. In this modern day, we are virtually 
living in our cell phones, chatting with our nears and dears, talking 
through audio or video calls, sharing material in public and private, 
passing messages, throwing information, pasting advertisements and 
storing images, audios-video clips, subject information and what not, 
therefore, our phone is like or not less than a home. Every relation 
domestic or private which the people keep within four walls of their 
house is legally protected under the Constitution, that is the reason 
dignity of a man and, subject to law, the privacy of home is inviolable 
right of every individual as per Article 14 (1) of the Constitution of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. We know that the human 
inclinations have no limits, it expands to religion, Sufism, ideology, 
politics, art, culture, customs, traditions, literature, music, Poetry, 
history, business, sports etc., anything can appeal to an individual in 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
11
 
 
whose pursuit it explores books, knowledge vents like public libraries, 
websites on Google, Face book, U-tube, Twitter, correspondence with 
scholars etc., and such exploration of physiological knowledge is not 
prohibited under the law. Reason flies beyond comprehension, 
institutionalized processes and worldly scheme of avenues; it 
struggles, unless it is settled to an acquiesced concept of 
understanding. Until then if any information which the person wants 
to keep secret in his cell phone cannot be extracted except with his 
consent or as the law directs because privacy of home is subject to law 
as reflected from Article 14 above; therefore, if his limits or collection 
of information are against the law of land, then he can well be 
restricted through the process of law. As a fundamental constitutional 
right, the right to privacy is meant to take precedence over any other 
inconsistent provisions of domestic law. Article 8 of the Constitution 
provides that "any law, or any custom or usage having the force of 
law, in so far as it is inconsistent with the rights conferred under the 
Constitution, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void." 
Article 8 (5), furthermore, states that "the rights conferred by this 
Chapter shall not be suspended except as expressly provided by the 
Constitution." 
 
14.  Pakistan is a signatory to several international and regional 
instruments with privacy implications, including: 
 The International 
Covenant 
on 
Civil 
and 
Political 
Rights (signed April 2008, ratified June 2010). Article 17 of the 
ICCPR states that "no one shall be subject to arbitrary or 
unlawful 
interference 
with 
his 
privacy, 
family 
or 
correspondence." The ICCPR also commits Pakistan to 
ensuring the protection of other rights that rely on the 
protection of privacy, such as freedom of expression and 
freedom of association. 
 The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam (signed 
August 1990). Article 18 of the CDHRI affirms that: "a) 
Everyone shall have the right to live in security for himself, his 
religion, his dependents, his honor and his property. (b) 
Everyone shall have the right to privacy in the conduct of his 
private affairs, in his home, among his family, with regard to 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
12
 
 
his property and his relationships. It is not permitted to spy on 
him, to place him under surveillance or to besmirch his good 
name. The State shall protect him from arbitrary interference. 
(c) A private residence is inviolable in all cases. It will not be 
entered without permission from its inhabitants or in any 
unlawful manner, nor shall it be demolished or confiscated and 
its dwellers evicted." 
 The Convention on the Rights of the Child (ratified November 
1990). Article 16 of the CRC states that "1) No child shall be 
subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her 
privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful 
attacks on his or her honour and reputation. 2) The child has the 
right to the protection of the law against such interference or 
attacks." 
 
15.   A number of laws regulate communications surveillance, 
acquisition of data and protection thereof in Pakistan, some of 
which are cited herein below with required expression relevant to 
the case in hand;   
The Investigation for Fair Trial Act, 2013 
This Act allows for access to data, emails, telephone calls, and 
any form of computer or mobile phone-based communication, 
subject to a judicial warrant. However, a warrant can be 
requested wherever an official has ‘reasons to believe’ that a 
citizen is, or is ‘likely to be associated’ with, or even ‘in the 
process of beginning to plan’ an offence under Pakistani law. 
The Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organization) Act, 1996. 
32. Warrants for search.— (1) Where on information 
furnished by the Authority or Board, the Court has reason to 
believe that any unlicensed telecommunication system, wireless 
telegraphy apparatus or unapproved terminal equipment or 
unapproved crypto apparatus is being kept or concealed or any 
unlicensed telecommunication service is provided, or any 
licensed service is being used against the interest of national 
security and public safety it may issue a search warrant; and the 
person to whom such warrant is directed, may enter the 
premises, vessel, aircraft, or hovercraft or place where such 
telecommunication system, wireless telegraphy apparatus or 
terminal equipment or crypto apparatus is allegedly kept or 
concealed or unlicensed telecommunication service is provided 
or any licensed service being used against the interest of 
national security and public safety therefrom carry out search 
and inspection thereof and seize such telecommunication

system, wireless telegraph apparatus or terminal equipment or 
crypto apparatus 
The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 
The Act contains a number of sections related to data privacy. 
However, these are intended to grant law enforcement and other 
government entities access to the private data of citizens, or to 
restrict citizens from gaining access to government data. 
Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 make it a crime for anyone to gain 
unauthorized access to any information system or data, or 
copying or transmission of critical infrastructure data, 
punishable with a prison sentence up to 3 months to seven years 
or a fine of up to fifty thousand to 10 million rupees. 
Section 31 allows a law enforcement officer to require a person 
to hand over data without producing any court warrant if it is 
believed that it is "reasonably required" for a criminal 
investigation. This can be done at the discretion of the officer 
and needs only be brought to the notice of a court within 24 
hours after the acquisition of the data. Section 32 requires 
telephone and Internet service providers to retain traffic data for 
at least one year. Law enforcement bodies can demand access 
to that data subject to a warrant issued by a court. Section 33 
allows courts to issue a warrant to a law enforcement officer to 
search and seize any data that "may reasonable be required" for 
a criminal investigation. In cases involving the vaguely defined 
"cyberterrorism", the officer can search and seize the data 
without a warrant and notify the court within 24 hours of its 
seizure. 
Section 35(2)(b) requires that law enforcement officers carrying 
out a search and seizure "take all precautions" to maintain the 
secrecy of the seized data and not interfere with any data not 
related to the crime being investigated.  
Section 39 permits for real-time collection and recording of 
information for a criminal investigation if a Court is satisfied on 
the basis of information furnished by an authorized officer. 
Section 42 allows the government to share any data obtained 
from its investigation with any foreign government or 
international agency. 
The Freedom of Information Ordinance, 2002 
According to section 17 of the Freedom of Information 
Ordinance, "Privacy and personal information", certain forms 
of "information is exempt if its disclosure under this ordinance 
would involve the invasion of the privacy of an identifiable, 
individual (including individuals) other than the requester."

All above references of law clearly speak that the acquisition of data 
stored in an information system or seizure of any articles containing 
such data requires intervention of Court either by obtaining warrant in 
this respect or otherwise an intimation to the Court after such seizure 
within 24 hours. Therefore, when any mobile phone is recovered from 
a suspect, and any data retrieval whereof from said phone is essential 
for criminal investigation, it could only be obtained with the 
permission of concerned Court with strict regard to privacy rights 
guaranteed under the Constitution.  
16.    Let’s see it with another angle that if any information is required 
to be extracted from a mobile phone recovered from an accused at the 
time of his arrest while considering it an article, then what is the 
process which regulates its use or disposal. Law suggests that such 
article is directed to be kept in safe custody; relevant section of 
Cr.P.C. is reproduced as under; 
51. Search of arrested persons: Whenever a person is arrested by a 
police-officer under-a warrant which does not provide for the taking of 
bail or under a warrant, which provides for the taking of bail but the 
person arrested cannot furnish bail, and  
 
whenever a person is arrested without warrant, or by a private person 
under a warrant, and cannot legally be admitted to bail, or is unable to 
furnish bail.  
 
The officer making the arrest or, when the arrest is made by a private 
person, the police officer to whom he makes over the person arrested, 
may search such person and place in safe custody all articles, other 
than necessary wearing apparel, found upon him. 
                                                                              (Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
The disposal of articles recovered on search is regulated under section 
523 of Cr. P.C which is as follows; 
 
523. Procedure by police upon seizure of property taken under 
Section 51 or stolen: (1) The seizure by any police officer of property 
taken under Section 51, or alleged or suspected to have been stolen, or 
found under circumstances which create suspicion of the commission 
of any offence shall be forthwith reported to a Magistrate who shall 
make such order as he thinks fit respecting the disposal of such 
property or the delivery of such property to the person entitled to the 
possession thereof, or if such person cannot be ascertained, respecting 
the custody and production of such property. 
 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
15
 
 
(2) Procedure where owner of property seized unknown: If the 
person so entitled is known, the Magistrate may order the property to 
be delivered to him on such conditions (if any) as the Magistrate thinks 
fit. If such person is unknown, the Magistrate may detain it and shall, 
in such case, issue a proclamation specifying the articles of which such 
property consists, and requiring any person who may have a claim 
thereto, to appear before him and establish his claim within six months 
from the date of such proclamation. 
                                                                                    
                                                                              (Emphasis supplied) 
 
The above provision makes it clear that for any property recovered on 
search u/s 51 of Cr.P.C. an appropriate order can only be made by 
magistrate concerned. This situation requires that Police officer if 
wanted to use such mobile/cell phone can request the magistrate for 
its analysis in support of allegation in the FIR, and magistrate after 
hearing the accused can pass order for examination and extraction of 
such information which is relevant to the case only, keeping strict 
regard to Article 14 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 
 
17.   A long history for tracking the infringement of privacy rights 
through cell phones has its roots in American jurisprudence, however, 
the relevant case laws best suited to present case are referred as under;  
                            
                        Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373 (2014) 
 
In this case, David Leon Riley while under a charge for shooting on 
rival gang, when arrested while driving on a vehicle, two guns were 
also found. Police also took into possession the cell phone from his 
pocket wherein some videos showing his connection withs gangs were 
watched and used in the trial, upon which jury convicted him for all 
three offences.  
Question; was the evidence admitted at trial from Riley's cell phone 
discovered through a search that violated his Fourth Amendment right 
to be free from unreasonable searches? 
 
                                 United States v. Wurie, 2014 
 
Boston police officers arrested Brima Wurie in 2007 for distributing 
crack cocaine. Among the items confiscated from Wurie was his cell 
phone, which rang repeatedly while he was detained. Without 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
16
 
 
obtaining a warrant, officers looked through the phone’s call log, and 
with that information, determined the address of a residence where 
they found drugs, a firearm, and ammunition. 
 
Question; was in this case was whether the Fourth Amendment permits 
the police, without obtaining a warrant, to review the call log of a 
cellphone found on a person who has been lawfully arrested. 
 
Fourth Amendment referred in above questions was in fact the 
Fourth Amendment (1791) to the Constitution of the United States of 
America, 
that 
forbids 
unreasonable searches 
and 
seizures of 
individuals and property. The text of amendment is follows; 
“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, 
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches 
and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall 
issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or 
affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be 
searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” 
 
The amendment was Introduced in 1789; the principle that, within 
reason, “every man’s house is his castle,” and that any citizen may fall 
into the category of an accused to whom protections ought to be 
provided accordingly. In U.S. Constitutional law, the Fourth 
Amendment is the foundation of criminal law jurisprudence, 
articulating both the rights of persons and the responsibilities of law-
enforcement officials.  
The Supreme Court finally tackled a privacy matter related to a 
cellphone in a unanimous single decision for above two cases i.e., 
Riley v. California & United States v. Wurie, 2014; the Court held 
that generally police cannot, without a warrant, search the digital 
contents of a cellphone of someone they arrested. Chief Justice John 
Roberts wrote: 
 
"The United States asserts that a search of all data stored on a cell 
phone is 'materially indistinguishable' from searches of these sorts of 
physical items. ... That is like saying a ride on horseback is materially 
indistinguishable from a flight to the moon. Both are ways of getting 
from point A to point B, but little else justifies lumping them together. 
Modern cell phones, as a category, implicate privacy concerns far 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
17
 
 
beyond those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet, or 
a purse. A conclusion that inspecting the contents of an arrestee's 
pockets works no substantial additional intrusion on privacy beyond 
the arrest itself may make sense as applied to physical items, but any 
extension of that reasoning to digital data has to rest on its own 
bottom. ... 
"Modern cell phones are not just another technological convenience. 
With all they contain and all they may reveal, they hold for many 
Americans 'the privacies of life'... The fact that technology now allows 
an individual to carry such information in his hand does not make the 
information any less worthy of the protection for which the Founders 
fought. Our answer to the question of what police must do before 
searching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly 
simple — get a warrant."         
                                                                               (Emphasis supplied) 
 
This precedent also reinforced the obtaining of warrant before 
extracting any information from a cell phone.  
18.    In United States of America it is thought that our lives are on our 
phones, making them a likely source of evidence if police suspect 
commission of a crime and there are myriad ways law enforcement 
can obtain that data, both externally and from the phone itself. 
Therefore, in USA, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 
1986 (ECPA) was introduced which dictates what law enforcement 
must obtain direction in the form of a subpoena, court order, or 
warrant, depending on what it’s looking for. Such law was enacted in 
the light of Fifth Amendment in the Constitution of USA (1791) 
which reads as under; 
 
“No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or 
otherwise 
infamous 
crime, 
unless 
on 
a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases 
arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in 
actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any 
person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in 
jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any 
criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be 
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of 
law; nor shall private property be taken for public use 
without just compensation.” 
 
Fifth amendment prohibits, compelling for answer to a capital charge, 
self-incrimination, double jeopardy, deprivation to life, liberty and 

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
18
 
 
property, and protection of private property. If a question affecting 
any right, protected under Fifth amendment, arises during the criminal 
proceedings, it is avoided by the accused while using the words “I 
plead the Fifth”. Extracting data from a phone colours the testimony, 
in such case, as revealing the contents of one’s own mind which 
amounts to self-incrimination. Therefore, civil rights advocates say 
that the government can’t force anybody to tell them phone’s 
password. However, information collected from cell phone of an 
accused if reveals something the government already knew, and the 
government can prove that prior knowledge, then no question of self-
incrimination arises and it is well known as “the foregone conclusion 
exception”. 
 
19.   By concluding above discussion, it could be said that our digital 
belongings i.e., phone, SIM, SD card data could have been copied and 
gone through; our phone may have been turned on, apps and browsers 
opened; the police might have access to any accounts our phones 
logged into. This means they may have read personal communication, 
noted personal accounts including email addresses, social media 
account names to follow, sent messages or made posts using our log 
in. Depending upon the circumstances of the arrest and the method of 
seizure of mobile device, we are subject to a certain set of rights, laws, 
or protections. In USA, it is the right of every person to decline the 
warrantless search of his mobile phone, if he is arrested or taken into 
police custody; he should verbally state that he does not consent to a 
search of his devices. A law enforcement agency is only permitted to 
conduct a warrantless search of his device if a compelling case for an 
emergency can be made. 
20.    The prohibition ensured and guaranteed through Fourth and 
Fifth Amendments in Constitution of USA as highlighted in preceding 
paragraphs includes self-incrimination; therefore, giving consent for 
acquisition or extraction of data from your cell phone by the law 
enforcing agencies during investigation of a case amounts to self-

 
Crl.A.No.73676 of 2022. 
19
 
 
incrimination. Our system too identifies same principles of protection 
like in USA. Such prohibition and protections are embodied in 
Articles 9, 12, 13, 14, 24 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973. Article 13 of the Constitution prohibits self-
incrimination which is reproduced as under; 
Protection against double punishment and self-incrimination 
 13. No person—  
(a)   shall be prosecuted or punished for the same offence more 
than once; or  
(b)  shall, when accused of an offence, be compelled to be a 
witness against himself.  
 
Above expression in Article 13(b) clearly indicates that no one can be 
compelled to be witness against himself; thus, offering your mobile 
phone for scrutiny can incriminate you for any offence, because it is 
not expected that everything you have stored in your phone by 
consent or was it downloaded systemically without the consent must 
be fresh in your memory. This offer amounts to self-incrimination 
which has been prohibited under the Constitution. As observed above 
Article 8 of the Constitution provides that "any law, or any custom or 
usage having the force of law, in so far as it is inconsistent with the 
rights conferred under the Constitution, shall, to the extent of such 
inconsistency, be void." Article 8 (5), furthermore, states that "the 
rights conferred by this Chapter shall not be suspended except as 
expressly provided by the Constitution. As per existing law if any 
data in cell phone is showing any crime link, that can be looked into 
in order to attend any emergent situation but then such inspection 
must be brought to the notice of Court concerned within 24 hours. On 
the spirit of Article 13 & 14 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, it is, therefore, held that spying over or 
extracting data from a personal phone of an individual or suspect is 
unconstitutional and illegal except with the permission of Court 
concerned. Any violation may entail punishment under the statutory 
law.

21. 
Coming back to the case, the totality of circumstance as 
discussed above indicate only one irresistible conclusion that the 
panorama of prosecution case theory is not confidence inspiring; thus, 
prosecution has failed to prove the charge against the appellant beyond 
shadow of reasonable doubt. Above submission finds support from the 
judgments reported as “The State through P.G. Sindh and others vs. 
Ahmed Omar Sheikh and others” (2021 SCMR 873) and “Najaf Ali 
Shah vs. The State” (2021 SCMR 736) wherein Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held that for extending benefit of doubt it was not 
necessary that there should be many circumstances, if there was only 
one doubt, the benefit of same must go to the accused; therefore, in the 
given circumstances, Crl. Appeal No.73676 of 2022 filed by the 
accused/appellant is ALLOWED, the conviction and sentence of the 
appellant is set-aside and he is acquitted of the charge by extending 
the benefit of doubt. He is in custody; he be released forthwith if not 
involved in any other criminal case. The case property, if any, be 
disposed of in accordance with law and record of the learned trial 
court be sent back immediately.
