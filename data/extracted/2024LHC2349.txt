Barrister Salman Safdar, Advocate for the petitioner.  
Rana Muhammad Imran Anjum, Deputy Prosecutor 
General with Rafaqat, SI. 
     
               Petitioner while invoking concurrent jurisdiction of this Court 
under section 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (Cr.P.C.) 
sought pre-arrest bail in case FIR No.365/23 dated 05.03.2023 under 
sections 186, 353, 148, 149, 212, 506ii, 172, 173 & 174 PPC, Police 
Station Race Course, Lahore on the ground that being ex-Prime 
Minister of Pakistan, he is facing serious security threats, therefore, 
cannot approach to the Court of Sessions without proper safety 
measures. Learned Counsel for the Petitioner stated that in a similar 
situation petitioner has succeeded to obtain an order from the Chief 
Commissioner Islamabad Capital Territory for an arrangement of 
fixation of his eight pre-arrest bail petitions with one time 
representation at a secured premises in Federal Judicial Complex G-
11/4, Islamabad and is also making efforts for like arrangement in the 
Punjab, therefore, at least till then interim pre arrest bail may be 
granted. While relying on cases reported as “Sh. ZAHOOR AHMAD 
versus THE STATE” (PLD 1974 Lahore 256); “ABDUL MAJID 
AFRIDI versus The STATE” (2022 SCMR 676); “RAIS WAZIR 
AHMAD Versus THE STATE” (2004 SCMR 1167) &“THE STATE 
versus Malik MUKHTAR AWAN” (1991 SCMR 322), request of the 
petitioner was acceded to and ad interim pre arrest bail was granted to 
the petitioner on 11.07.20023.  
 
2.        Learned Counsel for the petitioner while highlighting a changed 
scenario responded that the petitioner now being convicted prisoner is 
serving out his sentence in Adyla Jail, Rawalpindi, therefore, cannot

appear before this Court nor can seek bail in absentia before the 
Sessions Court; therefore, it is well within the legal framework to ask 
for decision of his bail petition on merits by this Court. He suggested in 
the course of arguments that appearance of accused before the Court 
for pre-arrest bail is essential only on the first date of hearing and 
thereafter, petition must be decided on merits even in his absence. 
Reliance he placed on cases reported as “Mst. SALIMA BIBI and others 
Versus THE STATE” (2000 P Cr. L J 138) & “SUBEDAR (RTD.) 
ABDUL REHMAN AND ANOTHER Versus THE STATE” (1981 P Cr. 
L J 61) in this respect.  While referring case reported as “Sahibzada 
AHMAD RAZA KHAN QASURI AND 4 OTHERS Versus THE STATE” 
(1974 P Cr. L J 482); submitted that it is only discretionary with the 
Court to insist on presence of accused at the time of confirmation of 
bail. The right course he suggested should be the forfeiture of bail 
bonds but Court cannot decline to decide the bail petition on merits in 
the absence of accused. Case reported as “Maulana FATEH 
MUHAMMAD Versus The STATE” (PLD 1973 Lahore 874) was 
referred in this respect. Finally relied on case reported as 
“MUHAMMAD SHAFIQUE Versus The STATE and another” (2018 
YLR 323) wherein accused was under arrest in another case but his 
pre-arrest bail petition was decided on merits while touching the 
principle of fair trial based on access to justice. His submissions 
continued with the solicitation that if above request is not acceded to 
then case reported as “FARHAN MASOOD KHAN versus STATE etc.” 
(PLJ 2021 Cr. C Lahore 550) comes into rescue of the petitioner with 
a settled legal premise that arrested in another case, accused shall not 
be deprived of decision of his bail petition on merits and his presence 
can be secured by his summoning from the police/judicial custody.  
 
3.       Learned Deputy Prosecutor General on the other hand opposed 
the above contentions on the ground that attendance of accused for pre-
arrest bail on each and every date is the requirement of law and in his 
absence, petition cannot be decided on merits. Further states that only 
under trial prisoners (UTPs) can be summoned for their appearance in 
other cases but this facility is not available to the convicted prisoners, 

 
 
Crl. Misc. No. 46363-B of 2023                                                                                               3 
 
like the present petitioner. Upon which, learned Counsel for the 
petitioner switched over to his alternate prayer of securing the presence 
of petitioner through video link and in this respect referred the 
judgment dated: 21.09.2023 passed by Division Bench of Islamabad 
High Court, Islamabad in Criminal Revision No.127-2023 titled as 
“Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi versus The State, etc. & judgment of 
Lahore High Court in Criminal Revision No.54056/2023 titled as 
Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi vs Spl. Judge, A.T.C, etc. Learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General, however, stated at bar that the petitioner is 
serving out his sentence as convicted prisoner in Adyla jail, 
Rawalpindi. 
 
4.    By the statement of Learned Deputy Prosecutor General who is 
standing in representation of State/Government, the whereabouts of the 
petitioner has been brought into the notice of this Court, therefore, the 
very purpose of securing the presence of petitioner stands resolved 
because the wisdom of legislature for requiring the presence of 
petitioner before the Court for seeking pre-arrest bail of course is the 
assurance that accused being alive is within the country and has not 
absconded. Another reason for requiring presence of accused is 
providing of an opportunity to effect his arrest, though not in Court 
premises, after dismissal of his petition for pre-arrest bail. In a case 
reported as “SHAHZAIB and others Versus The STATE” (PLD 2021 
Supreme Court 886), Supreme Court of Pakistan deprecated the 
practice of dismissing the petitions for pre-arrest bail due to non-
prosecution when counsel seeks dispensing with the attendance of 
accused; Court must provide an opportunity to explain reasons of his 
non-appearance on the date fixed in the petition. Similar principle was 
already breathing in our jurisprudence as laid down by Full Bench of 
this Court in case reported as “SHABBIR AHMAD versus THE 
STATE” (PLD 1981 Lahore 599). Though presence of the accused is 
essential on all subsequent dates including on stage of confirmation of 
his bail yet Court is authorized to dispense with his attendance; 
reliance is on “NOOR AHMAD AND ANOTHER versus THE STATE” 
(PLD 1982 Lahore 214).  

 
 
Crl. Misc. No. 46363-B of 2023                                                                                               4 
 
 
 
5.   While hearing divergent views and arguments of the parties, 
section 498-A Cr.P.C. needs to be read and examined again which is as 
under; 
 
498-A. No bail to be granted to a person not in custody, in Court or 
against whom no case is registered, etc.: Nothing in Section 497, or 
Section 498 shall be deemed to require or authorise a Court to release on 
bail, or to direct to be admitted to bail, any person who is not in custody 
or is not present in Court or against whom no case stands registered for 
the time being and an order for the release of a person on bail, or a 
direction that a person be admitted to bail, shall be effective only in 
respect of the case that so stands registered against him and is specified 
in the order or direction. 
 
        The section commands three essentials for grant of bail; which are 
(i) accused must be in custody or (ii) present before the court, and (iii) 
a case must be registered. Though above section uses two expressions 
for grant of bail i.e., ‘to release on bail’ or ‘ to be admitted to bail’, 
probably for grant of bail under sections 497 & 498 of Cr.P.C. 
respectively, therefore, it is usually read that expression ‘to release on 
bail’ relates to custody and is used for post arrest bail while ‘to be 
admitted to bail’ connotes presence of accused in Court and is used for 
pre-arrest bail, yet it is a misconception which has already been 
clarified by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The words “admitted to 
bail” are used both in sections 498 & 498-A Cr.P.C., therefore, 
Supreme Court of Pakistan while interpreting words “admitted to bail” 
used in section 498 of Cr.P.C. observed in case reported as 
“MUHAMMAD AYUB versus (1) MUHAMMAD YAQUB AND (2) 
THE STATE” (P L D 1966 Supreme Court 1003), as under; 
 
 
“In Hidayatullah Khan's case, which was a Full Bench decision of the    
Lahore High Court, the view was undoubtedly expressed that the words 
"admitted to bail", do not bear the same connotation as "released on bail". 
This interpretation, however, was not accepted by the Federal Court in 
Khushi Muhammad's case and again, recently by this Court in Sadiq Ali's 
appeal. It was observed that these two expressions are synonymous as 
was borne out by their being used in the same sense in several sections 
of the Code. Reference in this section may be made to the language of 
sections 51, 62, 426, 427, 500 and 563(2) of the Code. The two 
expressions appear to have been used interchangeably in the Code and I 
do not see any reason to revise the opinion which I expressed in Sadiq 
Ali's case on this point, even after hearing the arguments advanced at the 
Bar in this case.”      
                                                                                  (Emphasis supplied) 
                                                         
 

 
 
Crl. Misc. No. 46363-B of 2023                                                                                               5 
 
         In Sadiq Ali’s case referred supra reported as “SADIQ ALI 
Versus THE STATE” (PLD 1966 Supreme Court 589), the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in an unequivocal term explained that the words 
“admitted to bail” is used for any accused who is in custody or, not in 
custody; which is as follows; 
 
“The words occurring in section 498 "direct that any person be admitted 
to bail" were emphasized and the opinion was expressed that the power of 
the Court extended not only to the grant of bail to persons who are in the 
custody of the High Court, or of an inferior Court or a police officer, but 
also includes a power to give directions in exceptional cases that persons 
should be admitted to bail, who are not in custody.”  
 
 
        It is clear from the above dictum that an accused who being on 
interim pre-arrest bail is either present before the Court or in custody in 
another case can seek decision of his petition on merits.  
 
6.   Thus, it is clear that an accused who is granted interim pre arrest 
bail by the Court and directed to remain incessant in appearing before 
the Court on each and every date of hearing in the petition, becomes 
Custodia legis as declared in case reported as “SHABBIR AHMAD 
versus THE STATE” (PLD 1981 Lahore 599), which means that his 
custody in that case now would be regulated only by the Court until 
decision of his bail petition; therefore, in the interregnum if he is 
arrested in another case, the Court while considering him in custody as 
mentioned in section 498-A Cr.P.C., is authorized to grant or refuse 
him bail in his absence, or ask for his production before the Court as 
held in “FARHAN MASOOD KHAN versus STATE etc.” (PLJ 2021 
Cr. C. Lahore 550) or secure his attendance through video link as 
directed in case reported as Criminal Revision No.54056/2023 titled as 
Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi vs Spl. Judge, A.T.C, etc. Similar 
expression is embedded in following case reported as “ZEESHAN 
KAZMI versus THE STATE” (1997 M L D 273); 
 
 
“Now with the addition of section 498-A in the Code, in my view, it has 
become necessary that an accused who is not in custody should 
surrender himself before the Court when his bail application is taken up 
for hearing.” 
                                                                                      (Emphasis supplied) 
                                                                     
        On the same analogy, in a case reported as “MUHAMMAD 
SHAFIQUE Versus The STATE and another” (2018 YLR 323) 

 
 
Crl. Misc. No. 46363-B of 2023                                                                                               6 
 
wherein accused was under arrest in another case, this Court had 
decided his pre-arrest bail petition in his absence on merits while 
touching the principles of natural justice, fair trial and access to justice. 
 
 
7.  Every accused as Custodia legis, pending his bail petition, 
sometimes faces unavoidable situations which could restrict his 
appearance before the Court on subsequent dates; like if he fells ill, 
becomes busy in wedding of his children or  due to death of his near 
and dears, or is abducted or kept in illegal confinement, or under 
threats to life, or his easy and free access to the Court is restricted in 
any manner, then Court must grant him an opportunity to justify his 
absence, or if request is made for his recovery from the illegal custody, 
the Court must help prevent abuse of process by issuing an appropriate 
direction to know his whereabouts. The logic behind exercise of such 
powers, of course, is to save the dignity of a person from rigors of 
illegal arrest as guaranteed under the Constitution because arrest 
always brings humiliation, sufferings and also lowers the person in the 
estimation of others. Police should not arrest an accused who wants to 
approach to the Court of law for seeking protection. If police or any 
other person extend any such threat as not to move to the Court or 
make a legal application for protection, such act is an offence under 
section 190 of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 which is reproduced below 
for reference; 
190: Threat of injury to induce person to refrain from applying 
for protection to public servant: Whoever holds out any threat of 
injury to any person for the purpose of inducing that person to 
refrain or desist from making a legal application for protection 
against any injury to any public servant legally empowered as such 
to give such protection, or to cause such protection to be given, 
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term 
which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both. 
 
 
8.    As an additional note, this Court is not only a criminal Court as per 
section 6 of the Cr.P.C. but also a Constitutional Court under the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, therefore, 
unlike subordinate/inferior criminal Courts can pass appropriate order 
to protect the fundamental rights of a person with respect to life or 
liberty which does include to grant or decline pre-arrest bail in the 

 
 
Crl. Misc. No. 46363-B of 2023                                                                                               7 
 
absence of accused if he on subsequent dates in the petition is found to 
be in Police/judicial custody in another case. In the light of above legal 
position, the present petition for pre-arrest bail is being decided in the 
absence of accused/petitioner keeping in view the statement of learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General that petitioner at this moment of time is 
confined in Adyla jail, Rawalpindi as convicted prisoner in other case, 
and has not been arrested so far in this case.  
 
9.    Gist of allegations in FIR transpires that Nadeem Tahir SI/SHO 
Police Station Secretariat Islamabad along with police contingent 
approached to the residence of the petitioner in order to effect his arrest 
in execution of arrest warrants issued by Additional Sessions Judge, 
West Islamabad in a complaint dated 03.11.2022 under sections 
167/173 of Election Act, but faced a resistance offered by a mob of 
100/150 persons present at zaman park outside the residence of the 
petitioner and thereby used criminal force with intent to prevent or 
deter him in discharging his duty as such public servant. In such 
situation of chaos, Senator Shibli Faraz appeared before him, kept him 
in wait for a long time and finally on the back of warrants wrote a note 
that “Received on 05.03.2023 @ 12.58 PM Chairman Imran Khan is 
not available. However, we will comply with all legal processes. 
Senator Shibli Faraz COS to Chairman”, but he was not allowed to 
effect arrest of the petitioner. 
 
10. 
Prosecution had a say that it was done on the direction and 
instigation of the petitioner as reflected from the fact of making a live 
press conference by him in this respect later in the day. Learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General has submitted that accused had deliberately 
avoided the execution of warrants of arrest, therefore, committed 
offences mentioned in the FIR; however, conceded that he had no 
information as to grant of bail to Senator Shibli Faraz in this case. 
 
11.   Learned Counsel for the petitioner states that present case was 
registered by the police with malafide intention in order to humiliate 
the petitioner who being a law abiding citizen was pursuing his cases 
personally before the Courts in each nook and corner of the country 

 
 
Crl. Misc. No. 46363-B of 2023                                                                                               8 
 
and so far during investigation nothing incriminating was collected 
against the petitioner like proof of live conference which is also bereft 
of record, because its digital copy or transcript has not been obtained 
from PEMRA or any other agency; which fact was conceded by 
learned Deputy Prosecutor General, however attempted to justify such 
default with the stance that learned Magistrate has declined the request 
of police for association of petitioner into investigation. It is observed 
that for collection of above material, participation of accused/petitioner 
into investigation was not sine qua non. Learned counsel for the 
petitioner stated that offences primarily against the petitioner under 
section 172, 173, 174 & 186 PPC are non-cognizable and bailable 
which are punishable maximum up to six months; though harbouring 
of offender, an offence under section 212 PPC is not against the 
petitioner as per FIR yet it is also bailable. Further stated that as in 
non-cognizable offences FIR could not be registered but with malafide 
intention of police, story of resistance at the site was crafted in order to 
apply cognizable offences under sections 212, 353 & 506ii PPC.   
 
12.  Attending to the contentions of proponents, it is apparent that 
sufficient material is not available on the record in support of 
allegations against the petitioner at this stage of the proceedings and 
propensity of police to take a shortcut by registering an FIR instead of 
following the legal process is reflective of malafide on their part, when 
law permits them to file a report before the concerned judge with a 
complaint under sections 172, 173, 174 PPC  against the petitioner for 
alleged disobedience to order of the Court. It has further been observed 
that when an accused is arrested in execution of a warrant of arrest 
issued from outside jurisdiction, police is bound to produce the accused 
before the concerned Magistrate under section 86 of Cr.P.C. for 
reporting his execution of duty in accordance with law and in such 
situation Sessions Judge is authorized to grant ‘an interim post arrest 
bail’ to the arrested accused, if the offences are non-bailable, on 
furnishing surety by the accused to appear before the Court concerned 
on the date fixed. It is learnt that Sessions Judges frequently exercise 
such power liberally in order to save the accused from rigors of arrest. 

 
 
Crl. Misc. No. 46363-B of 2023                                                                                               9 
 
Thus, it is apparent that very registration of FIR was result of malafide 
against the petitioner probably due to political victimization. The 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case reported as “Shahzada Qaiser 
Arfat alias Qaiser vs. The State and another” (PLD 2021 Supreme 
Court 708) has held that malafide being a state of mind cannot always 
be proved through direct evidence, and it is often to be inferred from 
the facts and circumstances of the case. It has further been held by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases reported as “Khair Muhammad 
and another vs. the State through P.G. Punjab and another” (2021 
SCMR 130), “JAVED IQBAL versus The STATE through Prosecutor 
General of Punjab and another” (2022 SCMR 1424), “MUHAMMAD 
UMAR WAQAS BARKAT ALI versus The STATE and another” (2023 
SCMR 330) and “ABDUL REHMAN alias MUHAMMAD ZEESHAN 
versus The STATE and others” (2023 SCMR 884) that while deciding 
pre-arrest bail application merits of the case can also be touched upon 
and question of further inquiry can be stretched at this stage as well. In 
the circumstances, apparently petitioner has made out a case for grant 
of pre-arrest bail on the touch stone of further inquiry.  
 
13.       In the light of above circumstances, this petition is allowed and 
ad-interim pre-arrest bail already granted to the petitioner is confirmed 
subject to furnishing fresh bail bonds in the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- (five 
lac) with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned 
trial Court.
