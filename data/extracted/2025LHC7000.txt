Date of Hearing: 11.11.2025 
Appellant by: 
Ch. Muhammad Shafi Meo, Advocate, 
assisted by Mr. Naeem Akhtar Gujjar, Mr. 
Muhammad Rashid Khan Baloch and Mr. 
Muhammad Sarwar Meo, Advocates.  
Respondent by:  Mr. Muhammad Naveed Farhan, assisted

Anwaar Hussain, J. Through this common judgment, 
present as well as connected Regular Second Appeal bearing 
No.35/2017 
(“connected 
appeal”) 
are 
being 
decided 
simultaneously as identical question of law is involved albeit the 
respondents before this Court, in both cases, are two different 
individuals, however, both claim sale of plots through registered 
agreements to sell, of even date, i.e., 06.01.2005, against the 
appellant and invariably the evidentiary resume of both the cases 
is identical. 
2. 
The registered agreements to sell were executed on 
06.01.2005 and the sale price was settled as Rs.305,000/- (in both 
cases). In terms of the agreements, statedly, earnest money to the 
tune of Rs.125,000/- was paid in advance and remaining amount 
was to be paid in instalments (in both the cases). The Courts 

 
RSA No.34/2017                                                                                        2 
below decreed the suits of the respondents for specific 
performance of agreements to sell (in both matters) and when 
appeals were preferred by the appellant, the same were also 
dismissed, through separate judgments of even date, i.e., 
06.01.2005. 
3. 
It is the case of the appellant that the purported receipts of 
balance sale consideration were not witnessed, hence, had no 
evidentiary value in terms of Article 17 read with Article 79 of 
the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (“QSO”). Learned counsel 
for the appellant further states that the receipts were brought in 
the statement of the counsel for the respondents and therefore, 
had no evidentiary value and places reliance on the law laid down 
in case reported as Mst. Akhtar Sultana v. Major Retd. Muzaffar 
Khan Malik through his legal heirs and others (PLD 2021 SC 
715). He further contends that the suits were time barred 
inasmuch as the last payment was purportedly made on 
01.12.2007, in both the cases, whereas the suits were instituted 
on 24.07.2012 and this aspect has escaped notice of the Courts 
below. 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents submits 
that the suit plots were part of a town development scheme 
launched by the appellant in the name and style of “Al-Mustafa 
Town” and the appellant has sold multiple plots in the said 
scheme to different persons, including the respondents before this 
Court, through registered agreements to which presumption of 
correctness is attached. He further contends that in this regard, 
payment receipts were clearly in printed form and duly referred 
in the registered agreements. He avers that marginal witnesses of 
the agreements were produced who supported the stance of the 
respondents. Responding to the argument that the suits were time 

 
RSA No.34/2017                                                                                        3 
barred, he submits that no date for actualization (of registered sale 
deed) was referred in the agreements, therefore, the cause of 
action arose when the appellant refused to transfer the plots in the 
names of the respondents. As regards the objection that the 
payment receipts have no evidentiary value as the same were 
produced in statements of counsel for the respondents conducting 
the trial, learned counsel for the respondents submits that the 
wisdom behind the dicta laid down in case of Mst. Akhtar Sultana 
supra is that an advocate, who brings on record documentary 
evidence, is not crossed-examined whereas in present case, the 
PWs while deposing clearly referred to the registered agreements 
and the receipts, who were cross-examined by the appellant but 
the same was not fruitful. Further avers that once the receipts 
were brought on record in statement of the counsel, the same were 
also confronted to DWs (including the appellant who appeared as 
DW.1 in both cases) and there was no explicit denial to issuance 
of the receipts. Further adds that no stance regarding the non-
genuineness of the receipts was taken before the First Appellate 
Court below. In order to further substantiate his stance, learned 
counsel for the respondents avers that multiple cases were 
instituted against the appellant as he defrauded many innocent 
buyers like the respondents and one such matter came before this 
Court in C.R. No.935/2018 titled Ghulam Mustafa Mazhar v. 
Parveen Akhtar wherein findings of the Courts below rendered 
against the appellant were maintained through judgment dated 
19.01.2023.  
5. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the appellant contends that 
claim of reference by the PWs to the receipts is misconceived 
inasmuch as the evidence of the PWs was recorded on 19.11.2015 
whereas the counsel of the respondents brought on record the said 

 
RSA No.34/2017                                                                                        4 
receipts/documents on 07.12.2015, hence, no benefit can be 
given to the respondents for such reference.  
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
7. 
The 
controversy 
essentially 
revolves 
around 
the 
evidentiary value of certain receipts/documents, which were 
brought on record through the statement of counsel but were 
subsequently confronted to the defendant during his cross-
examination. The learned Courts below concurrently found such 
receipts/documents to be part of the admitted contractual 
transaction between the parties recorded in registered agreements 
to sell. In these circumstances, the following question of law 
arises for determination in the present and connected appeal: 
“Whether, in the facts and circumstances of the 
present case, documents brought on record through 
the statement of counsel, but subsequently confronted 
to the opposite party’s witness and forming part of a 
registered 
contractual 
transaction, 
possess 
evidentiary value in view of the principle laid down 
by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Mst. Akhtar 
Sultana 
supra, 
which 
otherwise 
excludes 
consideration of documents not proved through 
witnesses in accordance with law?” 
8. 
The object of the principle laid down by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court in case of Mst. Akhtar Sultana supra is to preserve 
the sanctity of the evidentiary process and to ensure that no 
document which has not been duly proved in accordance with 
law—particularly those produced through counsel’s statement 
without being confronted to the witnesses is relied upon for 
adjudication. The ratio of the said judgment, therefore, is not to 
rely upon the documents that never became part of the evidence 
through any lawful mode of proof or confrontation. 

 
RSA No.34/2017                                                                                        5 
9. 
Having above legal position in sight, perusal of evidentiary 
resume of the present case reveals that the situation is materially 
distinguishable. The agreements between the parties are 
registered documents containing thumb impressions and 
signatures of the appellant. Presumption of correctness is 
attached to such registered documents. However, the appellant 
has denied the same. No effort was made by the appellant to get 
forensic comparison of his thumb impressions on the said 
documents to establish that any fraud was committed by the 
respondents. Even otherwise, a comparison of the agreements to 
sell executed in both matters shows that the terms and conditions 
are almost identical, except for the variation in plot numbers, and 
both bear the thumb impressions of the appellant and the 
respective vendees—two different women who are respondents 
before this Court. The suggestion that both of them 
simultaneously committed fraud/coercion upon the appellant 
before the Sub-Registrar’s Office in obtaining his thumb 
impressions on identical printed agreements (to sell) is wholly 
implausible. These circumstances collectively indicate that the 
appellant had in fact launched a housing scheme under the name 
and style of “Al-Mustafa Town,” allotted plots to the general 
public, received substantial amounts under the agreements and 
then issued printed receipts in the ordinary course of business, 
and, when called upon to deliver the possession of plots and 
execute sale deeds, resiled from his commitments in a manner 
indicative of calculated deceit. 
10. 
As regards the receipts issued by the appellant in respect 
of payments made by the respondents, it is imperative to note that 
clause No.10 of the agreements expressly authorises the vendor 

 
RSA No.34/2017                                                                                        6 
(the appellant) to issue receipts from time to time against 
payments received. Clause 10 reads as under: 
”
10۔ ہلمج ااسقط ادا رک
تے
 وتق رفوتخ دننکہ الغم یفطصم  یک دطختس دشہ ردیس احلص
 رکان رضوری وہ اگ۔ وصبرت درگی طسق ادا دشہ وصتر
نہ
 یک اجےئ یگ۔“ 
Perusal of the record depicts that the receipts forming the basis of 
the decree were not only printed with the appellant’s own stamp 
but bears a seal and were also confronted to the appellant when 
he appeared as a witness (DW.1). He neither denied his signatures 
thereon nor offered any plausible explanation as to their issuance. 
The said receipts thus emanate from an admitted registered 
contractual transaction and constitute corroborative evidence, 
lawfully introduced and tested through confrontation. 
11. 
The matter can be examined from another angle as well—
the conduct of the appellant, which does not inspire confidence 
and reflects a pattern of deliberate evasion. In paragraph 3 of his 
written statement, while replying to the corresponding paragraph 
of the plaint (in both cases), the appellant candidly admitted that 
he had launched a housing scheme under the name of “Al-
Mustafa Town.” Para 3 of the plaint and its corresponding reply 
read as under: 
Para 3 of the Plaint:

However, when the appellant appeared as DW-1, he made a 
complete volte-face by denying the very existence of such a 
scheme, asserting that he had never developed any “Al-Mustafa 
Town.” The appellant DW-1 stated as under: 
 "ںیم
ےن المصطف
ی ٹاؤ
ن ےک انم رپ وکیئ اٹ
ؤ ن ہن انبای  وہا
ےھ۔"
 
 
Thus, his case falls within clutches of legal maxim Allegans 
Contraria Non Est Audiendus (A person who alleges things 
contradictory to each other is not to be heard) disentitling the 
appellant to any relief. This contradiction alone is sufficient to 

 
RSA No.34/2017                                                                                        8 
expose the intent of the appellant to mislead the Court and to 
defeat the legitimate claims of the allottees.  
12. 
Moreover, the present cases are not isolated instances of 
malafide on part of the appellant; similar patterns of denial have 
surfaced in other cases arising out of the same housing scheme. 
One such matter, bearing Civil Revision No.935/2018, was 
dismissed by this Court through judgment dated 19.01.2023, 
affirming the concurrent findings of the Courts below. On a 
pointed query by this Court, learned counsel for the appellant 
could not deny that the present cases are related to the same 
housing scheme, namely, “Al-Mustafa Town”.  
13. 
In view of the above discussion, the question of law framed 
hereinabove is answered in the manner that, while documents 
produced through the statement of counsel carry no evidentiary 
value and cannot be made sole basis of a judicial finding as a 
general rule, the position is materially different where such 
documents are subsequently confronted to the witnesses of the 
opposite party and form part of a registered contractual 
transaction. In such circumstances, their probative value stands 
recognised under the law, and reliance thereon by the Courts 
below does not amount to any legal error or misreading of 
evidence. Resultantly, the present as well as connected appeal 
have no merits, hence, dismissed.
