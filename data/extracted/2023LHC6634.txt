on 08.10.2014 at 02:00 p.m., are that his residential Dera is situated at a 
distance of 3-kilometer towards south side from village Miana Gondal 
whereas his agricultural lands are towards south-west side at a distance of

son), Ghulam Hussain and Muhammad Yaar were coming back after looking 
their lands and when reached near canal outlet (Mohga Nehri Nala) a bit 
ahead from Chah Gulab (

accused persons namely Abid armed with kalashnikov, Sajid armed with .303 
bore, Muhammad Asif armed with .44 bore, Amjad, Ehtisham, Umair, 
Muhammad Ashraf, Khizar Hayat, Shamshair, Azhar, Mukhtar, Muhammad 
Aslam, Muhammad Akram, Ameer armed with firearms along with four 
unknown armed with firearms, who were already ambushed on both sides of 
canal outlet, after seeing them and while raising lalkara started straight firing 
in order to commit their murder; Abid fired shot from kalashnikov which hit 
Muhammad Nawaz (brother of complainant) at back side of right buttock in 
result whereof, he fell down after becoming injured; they also lay down on the 
ground; in the meantime, Muhammad Asif fired shot with rifle .44 bore which 
hit at Ziafat Usman (son of the complainant) at his right foot; all accused 
persons also made firing with their respective weapons; since they were laying 
on the ground therefore, luckily they remained safe; after hearing report of 
firing, people from nearby Dera made aerial firing; accused persons after 
leaving them fled away from the spot; occurrence was witnessed by the 
complainant and his companions.  
 
 Motive behind the occurrence as per aforementioned statement                
(فرد بیان/Ex.PU) was enmity regarding previous murder and litigation between 
complainant and Abid Hussain, etc.; accused party had been putting pressure 
for compromise and on refusal, accused persons after consultation with each 
other and with the intention to kill, made straight firing and caused injuries to 
Muhammad Nawaz (brother of complainant) and Ziafat Usman (son of the 
complainant), who were taken to R.H.C. Miana Gondal, where Muhammad 
Nawaz succumbed to the injuries.  
 
In the light of aforementioned statement (فرد بیان/Ex.PU), F.I.R. (Ex.PL) 
was chalked out by Muhammad Inayat ASI/DO (PW-8). However, 
complainant/PW-16 subsequently got recorded supplementary statement for 
nominating Tasawar Iqbal, Ansar Iqbal and Muhammad Mansha in the case.  
  
During investigation, accused persons namely Muhammad Aslam, 
Muhammad Ashraf, Ehtisham ul Haq, Mukhtar Ahmad, Muhammad Akram 
and Amjad Iqbal were found not involved in the occurrence, however, after 
completion of investigation, challan report under Section: 173 Cr.P.C. was 
submitted in the Court by placing names of aforementioned accused persons in 

Criminal Appeal No. 29270/2019,

Column No.2 whereas names of other accused persons including present 
appellants in Column No.3 of the same; they all were summoned and formally 
charge sheeted but they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial, whereas Ameer s/o 
Ghulam Hussain (one of the accused nominated in aforementioned 
F.I.R./Ex.PL) was declared as “proclaimed offender” as he was not traceable; 
thereafter, prosecution evidence was summoned; after recording of prosecution 
evidence, accused persons were examined under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. but they 
refuted the allegations levelled against them; they neither opted to appear as 
their own witnesses under Section: 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence 
in their defence.  
 Trial Court after conclusion of trial while acquitting co-accused persons 
namely Sajid Iqbal, Muhammad Umair, Azhar Iqbal, Shamas alias Shamsher, 
Ansar Iqbal, Tasawar Iqbal, Khizar Hayat, Muhammad Mansha, Muhammad 
Akram, Amjad Iqbal, Ehtisham ul Haq, Mukhtar Ahmad, Muhammad Aslam 
and Muhammad Ashraf, has convicted and sentenced the appellants as 
mentioned above through the impugned judgment dated: 08.05.2019. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that eyewitnesses are 
chance witnesses, recovery of the weapons is inconsequential, ocular account 
is not truthful and even not corroborated by any independent evidence; 
convictions recorded and sentences awarded to the appellants through 
impugned judgment are against the ‘law and facts’ of the case. Learned 
counsel for the appellants finally prayed for acquittal of the appellants. 
5. 
Learned Additional Prosecutor General has supported the impugned 
judgment to the extent of convictions recorded and sentences awarded to Abid 
Ali and Muhammad Asif (appellants). Learned counsel for the complainant 
has supported impugned judgment to the extent of convictions recorded 
against aforementioned appellants however has prayed for enhancement of 
their sentences as well as compensation while supporting aforementioned 
Criminal Revision No.39425/2019 and also prayed for dismissal of the appeal 
filed by the convicts. Learned counsel for the complainant in support of Crl. 
Appeal No.39423/2019 against order of acquittal of Sajid Iqbal, Muhammad 
Umair, Azhar Iqbal, Shamas alias Shamsher, Ansar Iqbal, Tasawar Iqbal, Khizar 
Hayat, Muhammad Mansha, Muhammad Akram, Amjad Iqbal, Ehtisham ul 
Haq, Mukhtar Ahmad, Muhammad Aslam and Muhammad Ashraf, has 
submitted that said order of acquittal is against the law and facts; result of

misreading and non-reading of evidence; prosecution has proved its case 
against them too, up to hilt and they may also be convicted and sentenced.  
 
6. 
Arguments heard.  Record perused. 
 
7.   
It has been noticed that as per case of prosecution, occurrence took 
place on 08.10.2014 at 12:00 p.m. (noon) within the area of Union Council: 
Miana Gondal; after receipt of firearm injuries by Muhammad Nawaz (brother 
of complainant) and Ziafat Usman (son of complainant/PW-17), they were 
shifted to R.H.C. Miana Gondal, however, Muhammad Nawaz succumbed to 
the injuries there whereas Ziafat Usman (injured/PW-17) was medically 
examined by Dr. Muhammad Ilyas, SMO (PW-4); Muhammad Nazir 
(complainant/PW-16) got recorded his statement ( فرد  بیان/Ex.PU) for 
registration of case to Azhar Iqbal S.I./Investigating Officer (PW-20) in 
R.H.C. Miana Gondal on 08.10.2014 at 02:00 p.m., which was sent to police 
station and in the light of the same, First Information Report (F.I.R./Ex.PL) 
was recorded on 08.10.2014 at 02:20 p.m. by Muhammad Inayat A.S.I./D.O. 
(PW-8) whereas autopsy over dead body of Muhammad Nawaz (deceased) 
was conducted at 11:00 p.m. on 08.10.2014 by Dr. Saqib Ali (PW-13). It is 
natural phenomenon that generally efforts are made on priority basis for firstly 
shifting the injured persons to the hospital in order to save their lives and then 
to report the matter to the police; hence, in the peculiar facts and 
circumstances mentioned above, attempt of the complainant to firstly save the 
lives of his brother and son while taking them to R.H.C. Miana Gondal, is 
quite understandable and not contrary to the natural behavior. So, case has 
been got registered without unnecessary/unexplained delay and in the peculiar 
facts and circumstances mentioned above, postmortem examination also 
cannot be termed as conducted with unexplained delay; in this regard, 
guidance has been sought from the case of “MASKEEN ULLAH and another 
versus The STATE and another” (2023 S C M R 1568).  
 
 
 
Ocular account produced by prosecution comprises of statements of 
Muhammad Nazir (complainant/PW-16), Ziafat Usman (injured/PW-17) and 
Muhammad Yar (PW-18). Though said witnesses were not residents of the place 
of occurrence yet it has been mentioned in statement (فرد بیان/Ex.PU) as well as in 
the F.I.R. (Ex.PL) that residential Dera of the complainant/PW-16 is situated at a 
distance of about 3-kilometers towards south from village Miana Gondal whereas 
his agricultural land is towards south-west at a distance of about 2-kilometers 
from residential Dera; on 08.10.2014 at about 12:00 p.m. (noon),             
complainant (PW-16) along with Muhammad Nawaz (brother of complainant/

now deceased of the case), Ziafat Usman (son of the complainant/injured in 
the occurrence/PW-17), Ghulam Hussain (given-up PW) and Muhammad  
Yar (PW-18) were coming back after looking their lands and when           
reached near canal outlet (Mohga Nehri Nala) a bit ahead from Chah Gulab 
(  زد ومہگہ رہنی ن اہل ےچنہپ
ب ب اچہ الگب ےس وھتڑا آےگ ن
اینپ اینپ زنیم یک دھکی اھبل ےک دعب واسپ آ رےہ ےھت ےک ج), this occurrence took 
place. It goes without saying that it is routine of villagers that they usually go 
to their lands for looking after their crops etc. in the morning time and come 
back at about noon time; so, complainant and cited eyewitnesses have 
explained acceptable and valid reason regarding their presence at the relevant 
“time and place” of occurrence, which was quite natural and appeals to 
common prudent man; furthermore, Ziafat Usman (PW-17) is  the eyewitness 
who received firearm injury on his body during the occurrence and being 
injured witness his presence at the “time & place of occurrence” cannot be 
doubted/questioned. In view of above, though they were chance witnesses yet 
their testimony cannot be doubted/thrown away merely for the reason that 
they were having no residence over there at the place of occurrence rather 
same can be safely relied; in this regard, guidance has been sought from the 
cases of “ZAHID IQBAL versus The STATE” (2017 SCMR 1543), “AHSAN 
SHAHZAD and another versus The STATE and others” (2019 SCMR 1165) 
and “AMANULLAH versus The STATE and another” (2023 SCMR 527). 
It goes without saying that in this case, occurrence took place                      
on 08.10.2014 and statements of witnesses of ocular account i.e. Muhammad 
Nazir (complainant/PW-16), Ziafat Usman (injured witness/PW-17) and 
Muhammad Yar (PW-18) were recorded in the year 2019. Minor 
inconsistencies and discrepancies do appear in the statements of witnesses 
with the passage of time; however, such inconsistencies/discrepancies cannot 
dislodge the case of prosecution; in this regard, cases of “SAJID MEHMOOD 
versus The STATE” (2022 S C M R 1882) and “MUHAMMAD BASHIR and 
another versus The STATE and others” (2023 S C M R 190) can be safely 
referred. It is relevant to mention here that Muhammad Nazir (complainant/ 
PW-16) is brother of Muhammad Nawaz (deceased) and father of Ziafat 
Usman (injured) whereas said Ziafat Usman (PW-17) was himself injured of 
the case and Muhammad Yar (PW-18) was nephew of the complainant; as per 
case of the prosecution, role of causing fatal firearm injury to Muhammad 
Nawaz (deceased) has been ascribed to Abid Ali (appellant) whereas role of 
causing firearm injury at right foot of Ziafat Usman (injured witness) has been 
attributed to Muhammad Asif (appellant) and any valid/plausible reason to

make false deposition by the complainant/PW-16 and aforementioned 
eyewitness against both the appellants could not be brought/established on the 
record; furthermore, this is broad daylight occurrence, admittedly, previous 
criminal litigation existed between the parties, both the appellants were 
already known to the complainant and eyewitnesses including injured PW, 
hence, there was no question of misidentification of the accused 
persons/appellants; even there is no reason that why Muhammad Nazir 
(complainant/PW-16), Ziafat Usman (injured/PW-17) and Muhammad Yar 
(PW-18) will make substitution of the accused persons, who have committed 
murder of their close relative i.e. Muhammad Nawaz and caused firearm 
injury to Ziafat Usman; in such circumstances, substitution of the real culprits 
is rare phenomenon; in this regard, case of “IRSHAD AHMAD and others 
versus THE STATE and others” (PLD 1996 Supreme Court 138) can be 
advantageously referred, relevant portion from page No.143 of the same is as 
under:- 
“Undoubtedly, the substitution is a phenomenon of rare occurrence, 
because even the interested witnesses would not normally allow the real 
murderers of their relation to escape by involving innocent persons.” 
 
Guidance on the subject has also been sought from the cases of 
“MUHAMMAD AKHTAR versus THE STATE” (2007 SCMR 876), “SHERAZ 
KHAN versus THE STAE” (2010 SCMR 1772) and “NASIR AHMED versus 
The STATE” (2023 S C M R 478).  
 
  
After going through the statements of complainant (PW-16), Ziafat 
Usman (injured/PW-17) and Muhammad Yar (PW-18), it has been observed 
by us that they deposed required detail of occurrence in straightforward, clear, 
unambiguous and unequivocal manner; they were subjected to searching 
cross-examination but neither anything favourable to present appellants nor 
adverse to the prosecution could come on the record; furthermore credibility 
of their testimony could not be minimized/impeached; even otherwise, 
presence of Ziafat Usman (injured witness/PW-17) who was having stamp of 
receiving firearm injury on his body at the “time and place” of occurrence, is 
beyond doubt and his testimony carries more evidentiary value; in this regard, 
guidance has been sought from cases of “ALLAH DAD and others versus 
MUHAMMAD NAWAZ  and others” (2001 SCMR 1111), “MUHAMMAD 
SADIQ versus THE STATE” (2003 SCMR 736) and “AQIL versus The 
STATE” (2023 SCMR 831). Therefore, ocular account produced by the 
prosecution is confidence inspiring, truthful and reliable.

As per ocular version, Abid Ali (appellant) caused firearm injury at 
backside of right buttock of Muhammad Nawaz (deceased of the case);              
Dr. Saqib Ali  (PW-13) conducted postmortem examination over dead body of 
the deceased of the case and relevant portion of his statement before the Court 
is reproduced as under: - 
 
“Description of Injuries. 
1. A fire-arm lacerated wound of size 01 x 01cm with inverted 
margins going deep on right buttock. 
2. Contused selling[sic] of size 04 x 04cm at just below the 
umbilicus. 
Injuries No.1 & 2 are communicating to each other.  
 
Dissection of injuries No.1 & 2. 
Cause damage to bladder, small intestines (jejunum), which caused 
massive inside bleedings.” 
 
So, the firearm injuries caused by Abid Ali (appellant) damaged the bladder 
and small intestines (jejunum), which caused massive inside bleedings; 
therefore, said ocular version has been confirmed by medical evidence.  
  
Furthermore, as per case of prosecution, Muhammad Asif (appellant) 
caused firearm injury at right foot of Ziafat Usman (injured/PW-17); Dr. 
Muhammad Ilyas (PW-4) conducted medical examination of said injured                 
on 08.10.2014 at 02:00 p.m. and found firearm injury on the body of said 
injured and declared the same as “Jurrah Ghayr Jaifah Mutlahimah” 
attracting offence under Section: 337-F(iii) PPC; in this regard, relevant 
portion of his statement is mentioned below: - 
 
“Injuries. 
1 x 1 cm entry and exit wound lacerated in nature. No 
blackening and burning was seeing around, fresh little more clotted 
blood around. Located below right lateral malleolus, X-Ray was 
advised and injury was kept under observation. No other injury 
seen/stated on any part of the body.  
 
 
Nature of injuries. 
 
 
Injury No.1 was kept under observation.  
 
Probable duration of injury was within five hours.  
There was no possibility of fabrication in this injured. Kind of 
weapon was fire arm.  
On 22-10-2014, I.O of the instant case submitted application 
before me for declaration of injury No.1. Vide X-Ray No.13 dated 
16.10.2014, no bony injury was seen. No foreign body was seen. 
However, injury No.1 was declared as “Jurrah Ghayr Jaifah 
Mutlamiah”.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    (emphasis added) 
 
so, medical evidence comprising of Medicolegal Examination Certificate 
(Ex.PC) of Ziafat Usman (injured/PW-17) and statement of Dr. Muhammad 
Ilyas (PW-4), has also supported afore-mentioned ocular version.  
 
Now coming to the motive of the occurrence, prosecution produced copy 
of First Information Report as Ex.PAT (copy whereof is available at Page 

Criminal Appeal No. 29270/2019,

No.396 of the paper book) and perusal of the same reveals that Muhammad 
Nawaz (now deceased of the case) was first informant/complainant in the same, 
it was recorded on 30.12.2011 under Sections: 324, 148, etc. PPC at Police 
Station: Miana Gondal, District: Mandi Bahauddin against Abid Ali (now one 
of the appellants) and others; furthermore, motive has even not been denied 
rather admitted by the defence; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of 
Muhammad Yar (PW-18) is hereby reproduced: - 
 
“It is correct that both parties are worst enemy of each other”. 
 
Therefore, case of the prosecution against both these appellants is also 
corroborated by the motive.  
 
It is further noteworthy that Abid Ali (appellant) became fugitive from 
law after the occurrence, his non-bailable warrants of arrest (Ex.PF) and 
proclamation (Ex.PH) were also issued; he was declared as “proclaimed 
offender” and after remaining absconder for a considerable period of more 
than two years and seven months, he was ultimately arrested in this case                 
on 27.05.2017 but could not offer any valid/acceptable reason to explain the 
same; so, his unexplained and considerable abscondance also provides 
corroboration to the ocular account against him; in this regard, case of “NASIR 
AHMED versus The STATE” (2023 SCMR 478) can be safely referred: 
relevant portion of the same is reproduced below: - 
“Admittedly, the petitioner remained absconder for a period of about 
six months and the same is also a corroboratory piece of evidence 
against him.”  
 
In this regard, case of “MASKEEN ULLAH and another versus The 
STATE and another” (mentioned supra) can also be advantageously referred 
and relevant portion of the same is mentioned as under: - 
“This willful and unexplained abscondence fully corroborates the 
ocular account as he did not give any plausible explanation of such 
long abscondence.” 
 
  
  
As far as acquittal of co-accused persons namely Sajid Iqbal, 
Muhammad Umair, Azhar Iqbal, Shamas alias Shamsher, Ansar Iqbal, Tasawar 
Iqbal, Khizar Hayat, Muhammad Mansha, Muhammad Akram, Amjad Iqbal, 
Ehtisham ul Haq, Mukhtar Ahmad, Muhammad Aslam and Muhammad Ashraf  
is concerned, suffice it to say that as per own case of the prosecution, only 
generalized role of ineffective firing was alleged against all of them and any 
overt act was not attributed to them and more so, during investigation of the 
case, out of aforementioned accused persons, Muhammad Aslam, Muhammad 
Ashraf, Ehtisham ul Haq, Mukhtar Ahmad, Muhammad Akram and Amjad 
Iqbal were found not involved in the occurrence and even no weapon was

recovered from them; in this regard, case of “SAFDAR MEHMOOD and others 
versus TANVIR HUSSAIN and others” (2019 SCMR 1978) can be safely referred 
and relevant portion from the same is reproduced: - 
“For whatever its evidentiary value, the investigating agency had 
declared the appellant innocent.” 
 
Furthermore, Tasawar Iqbal, Ansar Iqbal and Muhammad Mansha were not 
nominated in the First Information Report (F.I.R./Ex.PL) rather they were 
subsequently introduced in the case through supplementary statement of the 
complainant/PW-16. Though firearm weapons were recovered from Sajid 
Iqbal, Muhammad Umair, Azhar Iqbal, Shams alias Shamsher, Khizar Hayat, 
Tasawar Iqbal, Ansar Iqbal and Muhammad Mansha yet empties/cartridge 
cases secured from the place of occurrence were found as not having been 
fired from the weapons statedly recovered from them as per report of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (available at Page No.134-136 of the paper 
book), so said recovery was inconsequential. While taking into consideration 
aforementioned reasons in totality, they have been acquitted for safe 
administrative of justice by the trial court, however, said acquittal cannot have 
any adverse effect on the case of prosecution against present appellants; in 
this regard, case of “SHAHEEN IJAZ alias BABU versus The STATE” (2021 
SCMR 500) can be advantageously referred and relevant portion of the same is 
hereby reproduced below: - 
“nomination 
of 
co-accused 
with 
inconsequential 
roles 
notwithstanding, their presence at the scene followed by acquittal, 
seemingly out of abundant caution, does not tremor prosecution’s 
mainstay qua the role assigned to the petitioner.”  
 
 
A rifle .44 bore was recovered from Muhammad Asif (appellant) but as 
pre report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore dated: 10.06.2016 
(copy whereof is available at Page No.134-136 of the paper book), empties 
secured from the place of occurrence have not been found as having been fired 
from said weapon; therefore, said recovery is of no avail however it cannot 
have any adverse effect on the case of prosecution.  
  
Now coming to the defence version. Abid Ali and Muhammad Asif 
(appellants) during recording of their statements under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. in 
reply to Question No.9 “Why this case has been made against you and why 
the witnesses of the prosecution have deposed against you?, stated as under: - 
“The story of prosecution is false, fabricated one. I have been falsely 
implicated in false story and complainant party tried their best to throw a 
wider net to falsely implicate my whole family. No independent person 

Criminal Appeal No. 29270/2019,

Murder Reference No.157/2019.

supported the prosecution version, so much so independent person negated 
the prosecution version. In fact the deceased has lost his life in an unseen 
occurrence at some unknown place when he was all alone. The injury on 
the person of Ziafat is concocted, self suffered and the result of 
connivance with doctor. Furthermore, FIR was registered with pre-
meditation pre- consultation after an unexplained delay. Post mortem was 
also conducted after delay. I am innocent.” 
 
Said version of the appellants is a bald assertion as they neither themselves 
appeared under Section: 340 (2) Cr.P.C. in support of their aforementioned 
version as well as to disprove the allegation levelled against them nor 
produced any other witness including any other resident of the vicinity in this 
regard. Even otherwise, there version could not find favour from the available 
record. Therefore, aforementioned version has neither been proved nor caused 
any dent in the case of prosecution and same is even otherwise of no avail to 
the defence.  
  
When Court has kept prosecution version in juxtaposition with defence 
version, then it has been observed by us that defence version stands nowhere, 
however, version of prosecution has been found as straightforward, truthful 
and reliable. 
  
In view of what has been discussed above, prosecution has proved its 
case against Abid Ali and Muhammad Asif (appellants) upto hilt, beyond any 
shadow of doubt; therefore, they have been rightly convicted as mentioned 
above; resultantly, aforementioned convictions recorded against both 
aforementioned appellants are upheld and maintained.  
 
8.   
As far as question regarding quantum of sentence awarded to Abid Ali 
(appellant) is concerned, it has been noticed that though kalashnikov (P-16) 
along with five cartridges (P-17/1-5) was recovered on the pointing out of the 
appellant, same was received in Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore  on 
08.06.2017 yet any report regarding comparison of the same with the 
empties/cartridge cases secured from the place of occurrence has not been 
produced by the prosecution rather as per report of Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore dated: 06.07.2017 (copy whereof is available at Page No.132 
of the paper book), said kalashnikov was found to be in mechanical operating 
condition with safety features functioning properly; in this regard, relevant 
portion of said report is hereby scanned below: - 

Criminal Appeal No. 29270/2019,  
Criminal Appeal No.39423/2019,  
Criminal Revision No.39425/2019 &  
Murder Reference No.157/2019.

Perusal of aforementioned report reveals that cartridge cases of the case had 
already been collected by Shoukat Ali T/ASI on 06.10.2016 from Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore and it was asked by said agency for re-
submission of said cartridge cases if comparison report is required with the 
rifle recovered from Abid Ali (appellant) but nothing is available on the 
record 
to 
show 
that 
investigating 
agency 
again 
submitted 
said 
empties/cartridge cases for comparison with said rifle; therefore, when there 
was nothing brought on the record to show that empties secured from the 
place of occurrence were found as having been fired with kalashnikov rifle 
recovered from the present appellant, then said recovery is inconsequential 
and of no help to the case of prosecution; in this regard, guidance has been 
sought from the case of “IMTIAZ alias TAJI and another versus The STATE 
and others” (2020 SCMR 287); relevant portions of said case law are reproduced 
below: - 
“Moreover, the report of FSL qua .44 bore rifle recovered from the 
appellant is only to the effect that said weapon is in working condition. 
As such, the same cannot be of much help for the prosecution.” 
 
“All these circumstances justify reduction in the quantum of sentence 
of the appellant from death to imprisonment for life.” 
 
In this regard, case of “AMANULLAH versus The STATE and another” 
(mentioned supra) can also be advantageously referred and relevant portion of 
the same is mentioned as under: - 
“So far as the quantum of punishment is concerned, keeping in view the 
fact that recovery was disbelieved, the learned High Court has already 
taken a lenient view and converted the sentence of death into 
imprisonment for life to meet the ends of justice, hence, it leaves no 
room for us for further deliberation on this score.” 
 

Criminal Appeal No. 29270/2019,  
Criminal Appeal No.39423/2019,  
Criminal Revision No.39425/2019 &  
Murder Reference No.157/2019.

Furthermore, Abid Ali (appellant) made single firearm shot at Muhammad 
Nawaz (deceased of the case). These both factors i.e. inconsequential recovery 
of weapon and single shot constitute mitigating circumstance for reduction of 
sentence of Abid Ali (appellant) from death to imprisonment of life; in this 
regard, case of “SAJID MEHMOOD versus The STATE” (2022 SCMR 1882) 
can also be safely referred; relevant portion from the same is reproduced as below: - 
“So far as the question of punishment is concerned, the learned High 
Court while taking into consideration-------------------------------------; 
appellant only fired single shot and co-accused of the appellant have 
been acquitted by the learned Trial Court, has rightly taken a lenient 
view and converted the sentence of death into imprisonment for life.”  
 
So, we convert sentence of “death” awarded to Abid Ali (appellant) by the 
trial court to “Imprisonment for Life” under Section 302(b) PPC; however, 
order passed by the trial court regarding payment of compensation by Abid 
Ali (appellant) to the heirs of the deceased and in respect of imprisonment in 
default thereof, are maintained. All the sentences of Muhammad Asif 
(appellant) are also maintained in toto. Benefit under Section: 382-B Cr.P.C. 
will be given to both the appellants and all the sentences awarded to them 
shall run concurrently. Therefore, Criminal Appeal No.29270/2019 is 
dismissed with partial modification/reduction in sentence of Abid Ali 
(appellant) as mentioned above whereas to the extent of Muhammad Asif 
(appellant), same is dismissed in toto.  
9.   
Murder Reference No.157/2019 is answered in negative and death 
sentence awarded to Abid Ali is not confirmed. 
 
10.   So far as order of acquittal of Sajid Iqbal, Muhammad Umair, Azhar 
Iqbal, Shamas alias Shamsher, Ansar Iqbal, Tasawar Iqbal, Khizar Hayat, 
Muhammad Mansha, Muhammad Akram, Amjad Iqbal, Ehtisham ul Haq, 
Mukhtar Ahmad, Muhammad Aslam and Muhammad Ashraf passed by trial 
court through impugned judgment dated: 08.05.2019, is concerned, we have 
noticed that for the reasons mentioned in paragraph No.7 of this judgment, the 
same is neither perverse, nor capricious nor arbitrary rather has been passed 
perfectly in accordance with law, facts and record of the case. After acquittal, 
accused persons have attained double presumption of innocence and courts 
are always slow to disturb the same and in this regard, reliance can be placed 
upon the case of “HAJI PAIO KHAN versus SHER BIAZ and others” 
(2009 SCMR 803) and “MUHAMMAD SHAFI alias KHDDOO versus 
The State and others” (2019 SCMR 1045); from, latter case law, relevant 
portion is reproduced:- 

Criminal Appeal No. 29270/2019,  
Criminal Appeal No.39423/2019,  
Criminal Revision No.39425/2019 &  
Murder Reference No.157/2019. 
14
“It is by now well settled that acquittal carries with it double 
presumption of innocence; it is reversed only when found blatantly 
perverse, resting upon fringes of impossibility and resulting into 
miscarriage of justice. It cannot be set aside merely on the possibility 
of a contra view.” 
 
Thus, Crl. Appeal No.39423/2019 is dismissed.  
11.  
So far as Criminal Revision No.39425/2019 filed by Muhammad Nazir 
(complainant) for enhancement of sentences of Abid Ali and Muhammad Asif 
and compensation amount is concerned, suffice it to say that neither any 
plausible reason for enhancement of the same could be referred at bar nor we 
found any such reason in the case; therefore, Criminal Revision 
No.39425/2019 also stands dismissed. 
12.  
Before parting with this judgment, we deem it essential to point out that 
in this case, cartridge cases were submitted in Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore on 13.10.2014, same were collected by Shokat Ali T/ASI           
on 06.10.2016 from there, however, when after arrest of Abid Ali (one of the 
appellants, who remained fugitive from law), a kalashnikov rifle was 
recovered from him and same was deposited in the office of Punjab Forensic 
Science Agency, Lahore on 08.06.2017, report was generated by said agency 
regarding mechanical operating condition of said rifle and it was further 
mentioned in said report that empty cartridge cases in the case have already 
been collected by Shokat Ali T/ASI on 06.10.2016 and re-submission of said 
cartridge cases was asked by said agency if the comparison report was 
required but astonishingly said cartridge cases were not again submitted in 
said agency so comparison report regarding matching of said empty cartridge 
cases with the kalashnikov rifle recovered from Abid Ali (appellant), could 
not be generated; hence, important piece of evidence was not brought on the 
record by the investigating agency, which is not appreciable at all rather 
amounts to destroying important piece of evidence in the case. Therefore, 
Registrar of this Court will send a copy of this judgment to Inspector General 
of Police, Punjab, Prosecutor General, Punjab and Director General of Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Punjab, Lahore, who will ensure that if in a case, 
one or more accused are absconders, then after submission of cartridge case 
(s) in the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore and even after its (their) 
comparison with any submitted weapon (s), same will kept in said agency, 
only brought from there for production in the court during trial and after 
recording of evidence regarding the same as well as their exhibition/ 
production, same will be again obtained with the written permission of court

and re-submitted/deposited in said agency till arrest of absconding accused 
and comparison of the same with weapon (s) recovered from said absconder 
(s) accused. Prosecutor General, Punjab will forward copy of this judgment 
and issue necessary instructions in this regard to District Public Prosecutors of 
all districts in the Punjab whereas Inspector General of Police, Punjab will 
send copy of this judgment and also issue necessary instructions to all the 
heads of police force in each district as well as Incharge of investigation 
wings in all districts in this regard.
