Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – This petition under section 561-A 
Cr.P.C. challenges the judgment of the Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore, 
dated 17.09.2021, affirming the Judicial Magistrate’s order of 16.06.2021, 
which dismissed the Petitioner’s plea under section 249 Cr.P.C. 
The facts 
2. 
 
Respondent No.2 lodged FIR No.652/2017 dated 10.06.2017 
against the Petitioner and his two sons (Bilal Tariq and Awais Tariq) at 
Police Station Liaqatabad, Lahore, for offences under sections 420, 467, 
468 & 471 PPC. She claimed that she had inherited a piece of land 
measuring 07 kanals 03 marlas in Mauza Pindi Rajputan, Tehsil Cantt., 
District Lahore, from her father, Shah Muhammad, vide Mutation 
Nos.19206 and 19916. On 12.04.2017, she learnt from the Halqa Patwari 
that the Petitioner had presented him Sale Deed No. 8247 dated 
06.08.1996, purported to have been executed by Shah Muhammad, for 
mutation of the aforementioned property in his name. She alleged that the 
said sale deed was bogus and did not bear her late father’s signature or 
thumb impression. The police investigated case FIR No. 652/2017 and 

Crl. Misc. No. 60825/M/2021

submitted a report under section 173 Cr.P.C. The Judicial Magistrate 
indicted the Petitioner and summoned prosecution evidence. He applied for 
a stay of proceedings under section 249 Cr.P.C. on the ground that four 
civil suits concerning the disputed property were pending. The Judicial 
Magistrate dismissed his application vide order dated 16.06.2021 holding 
that civil and criminal proceedings could be conducted concurrently. The 
revisional court upheld that order. Hence, this petition. 
The submissions 
3. 
 
Mr. Jahangir A. Jhoja, Advocate, contends that the learned 
courts below have not appreciated the facts of the case properly while 
passing the impugned orders. He submits that the Petitioner owned a big 
tract of land in Mauza Pindi Rajputan on which he planned to build a mill 
(Pak Board and Paper Mills) after buying additional land. Consequently, in 
1995 he made a deal with Shah Muhammad, who consummated the 
transaction in April 1996 through four sale deeds in his name, his wife 
Fouqia Tariq, and his son Bilal Tariq. These included Sale Deed No. 8247. 
Thereafter, Shah Muhammad delivered possession of the property to the 
Petitioner and his family. On 28.03.1996, in anticipation of the completion 
of the said transaction, the Petitioner got the building plan for the factory 
sanctioned. The counsel contends that Sale Deed No. 8247 was registered 
on 06.08.1996, while Shah Muhammad died on 31.10.2008. He lived for 
12 years after the registration of the disputed document but did not 
challenge it. Respondent No.2 lodged FIR No. 652/2017 nine years after 
his death with ulterior motives. Mr. Jhoja claims that Shah Muhammad 
defrauded the Petitioner and his family because he did not have title to the 
aforesaid property. In the circumstances, Respondent No.2 has no right to 
initiate proceedings against them, even if Sale Deed No. 8247 is not 
genuine. In any case, since civil litigation is pending between the parties, 
the interest of justice requires that criminal proceedings be stayed until 
those matters are decided. 
4. 
 
The counsel for Respondent No.2, Mr. Muhammad Maqsood 
Buttar, Advocate, has vehemently opposed this petition. He contends that 
in FIR No. 652/2017 the case of Respondent No.2 is that Sale Deed  
No. 8247 is forged and does not bear Shah Muhammad’s signature or 

Crl. Misc. No. 60825/M/2021

thumb mark. Since the forensic report has confirmed it, there is sufficient 
evidence to prosecute the Petitioner. The law does not bar simultaneous 
civil and criminal proceedings. The counsel argues that the impugned 
orders do not suffer from any illegality or irregularity which may call for 
interference by this Court. 
5. 
 
The learned Deputy Prosecutor General has supported Mr. 
Buttar. 
Discussion 
6. 
 
Civil law deals with the rights, duties, and obligations that 
individuals, governments, and organizations have to one another. Civil 
cases usually involve private disputes between them regarding those rights 
and obligations. On the other hand, criminal law is the foundation of the 
criminal justice system. It concerns crimes and their punishment. It 
seeksto preserve society’s values, morality, and norms by checking 
inappropriate behaviour. According to Blackstone, “private wrongs are an 
infringement … of the civil rights which belong to individuals … public 
wrongs, or crimes … are a breach and violation of the public rights and 
duties, due to the whole community ... in its social aggregate capacity.”1 
The use of punishment to enforce criminal law has five commonly 
accepted goals: retribution, deterrence, incapacity, rehabilitation, and 
restitution. Each country has its own set of criminal laws and punishments 
for breaches. 
7. 
 
It is trite that a single act can simultaneously trigger both civil 
and criminal legal action. “Proceedings for a civil wrong or a public wrong 
(offence) are independent and not mutually exclusive. Each set of 
proceedings has its own procedures, standards, and consequences.”2 The 
standard of evidence to determine the civil liability is the preponderance of 
evidence. In contrast, a criminal conviction is predicated on a higher 
standard of guilt, i.e., beyond a reasonable doubt, because it results in the 
loss of liberty.3

People in our country frequently try to have recourse to civil 
and criminal law contemporaneously to settle their disputes. Hence, the 
question as to whether criminal and civil litigation can proceed 
concurrently inevitably arises. Muhammad Akbar v. The State and 
another (PLD 1968 SC 281) is one of the earliest cases in which the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan considered the issue. In that case, there 
was a dispute about ownership of a bus registered in the name of a firm. It 
was the subject matter of a suit for dissolution of the partnership, and while 
it was pending, one of the partners lodged FIR against the other for forcibly 
retaining the vehicle. The High Court stayed the proceedings in the 
criminal case till the disposal of the civil suit. The Hon’ble Supreme Court 
upheld that order and ruled: 
“Normally, it is true that criminal proceedings should not be postponed 
pending the disposal of civil litigation connected with the same subject-
matter. But where it is clear that the criminal liability is dependent upon 
the result of the civil litigation or is so intimately connected with it that 
there is a danger of grave injustice being done in the case if there be a 
conflict of decisions between the civil court and the criminal court. In 
such an event, it is equally clear that the criminal court has not only the 
right to but should also stay its hands until the civil litigation is disposed 
of, for, it is not desirable that when the title to the property itself is in 
dispute, the criminal courts should give a finding in respect of the same 
question.” 
9. 
 
In Muhammad Akbar, it was the High Court, not the civil 
court, that stayed the criminal proceedings while exercising inherent 
jurisdiction under section 561-A of the Cr.P.C. Commenting on this aspect, 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court said: 
“There can be no doubt that the High Court has this power under section 
561-A Cr.P.C., but the only question as to whether it should exercise this 
power in civil proceedings in respect of the same or substantially the 
same subject-matter are also pending. There is now a consensus of 
opinion that there is no invariable rule that a criminal proceeding should 
be stayed pending the decision of the civil suit but the matter is one of 
discretion entirely. In exercising this discretion the guiding principle 
should be to see as to whether the accused is likely to be prejudiced if the 
criminal proceeding is not stayed. In cases of disputed title where it is 
difficult to draw a line between a bona fide claim and the criminal action 
alleged, a stay can be made in the proper exercise of that discretion.” 
10. 
 
In 
Muhammad 
Tufail 
v. 
The 
State 
and 
another  
(1979 SCMR 437), FIR was registered against the petitioner accusing him 
of preparing a forged sale agreement while civil litigation over the 
document was pending. He petitioned the High Court to quash that FIR on 
the ground that the document’s legitimacy was sub judice before the civil 

Crl. Misc. No. 60825/M/2021 
 
- 5 - 
court. The Hon’ble Supreme Court ruled that there is no legal impediment 
to civil and criminal actions continuing at the same time. The petitioner had 
prayed for proceedings to be quashed rather than stayed. If the evidence 
adduced during the proceedings shows that the matter only involves a 
question of civil liability, and that the proceedings before the criminal court 
are an abuse of the process of the court, he may apply again for the 
quashing of FIR. The apex Court ruled that it was not the proper stage for 
him to seek quashing of the proceedings because the Magistrate had just 
summoned the petitioner and had not taken any other action. 
11. 
 
In Abdul Haleem v. The State and others (1982 SCMR 988), 
the High Court had invoked section 561-A Cr.P.C. and quashed the 
criminal proceedings mainly on the ground that the dispute between the 
parties was of civil nature. It was argued before the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court that quashing of FIR was contrary to the established principles of the 
administration of criminal justice because it stifled the prosecution and 
enabled the respondents to avoid accountability for the alleged offences. 
The apex Court held that even though the impugned documents are the 
same in both civil and criminal cases, the mere fact that a civil lawsuit is 
pending does not absolve the accused of criminal liability if the stated facts 
show the commission of an offence. Generally, it is advisable to stay 
criminal proceedings until the conclusion of civil litigation between the 
parties to avoid a conflict of findings on the same questions by civil and 
criminal courts. The Supreme Court held that the High Court should have 
followed the rule enunciated in Muhammad Tufail v. The State and another 
(1979 SCMR 437), supra. It modified the High Court’s order and, instead 
of quashing the criminal proceedings, directed that they shall remain stayed 
till the decision of the civil litigation. 
12. 
 
In Akhlaq Hussain Kayani v. Zafar Iqbal Kiyani and others 
(2010 SCMR 1835), the complainant’s father-in-law died; four years later, 
his wife also passed away. He lodged FIR against the private respondents 
accusing them of fabricating documents and selling his father-in-law’s car. 
Before that, he instituted a civil suit on the same facts seeking a declaration 
that the transfer letter was bogus and ineffective against his rights. As an 
alternative relief, he pleaded for a decree for the amount of his share of the 
disputed car's sale proceeds. The accused/respondents objected that the 

Crl. Misc. No. 60825/M/2021 
 
- 6 - 
complainant had no locus standi to lodge the FIR because he had no 
concern with the vehicle. At the most, his late wife could be the claimant, 
but she omitted to lay a claim in her lifetime. In any event, his claim 
regarding ownership of the car depended on the decision of the civil suit. 
The accused filed a petition under section 561-A Cr.P.C. upon which the 
High Court quashed the FIR. The complainant sought leave to appeal 
against that order. The Hon’ble Supreme Court held that civil liability is 
independent of criminal liability, and there is no absolute rule requiring that 
criminal proceedings must remain pending till the decision of the civil suit. 
It is purely a matter of discretion. The court should always see whether the 
accused would be prejudiced if the criminal proceedings continue. When it 
is clear that criminal liability is dependent on the outcome of civil 
litigation, then criminal proceedings must be stayed, especially when the 
dispute relates to the title of property. In the aforesaid case, the Supreme 
Court noticed that the complainant's eligibility to lodge the FIR depended 
on the outcome of the civil suit, so it set aside the High Court’s order to the 
extent of quashing the FIR. However, it directed it would not proceed until 
the decision of the civil suit. 
13. 
 
The law enunciated in the above cases has been consistently 
followed. It is unnecessary to burden this judgment with more citations.4 
Nevertheless, I may refer to a few instances in which the court allowed 
civil and criminal proceedings to run side by side. In Malik Khuda Bakhsh 
v. The State (1995 SCMR 1621), the petitioner was an Overseas 
Employment Promoter and used to send people abroad for employment 
under a licence issued by the Government. Four persons made a complaint 
to the FIA against him that he fraudulently deprived them of Rs.83,000/- on 
the pretext of sending them abroad for a job and also issued a receipt in this 
regard. They also lodged FIR against him for an offence under Emigration 
Ordinance, 1979, and the Passport Act, 1976. The FIA submitted his 
challan in the Court of the Special Judge (Central), Rawalpindi. The 
petitioner claimed that the receipt was not genuine and was a piece of 
forgery. He challenged it in the civil court and asked the Special Court to 
                                          
4 See for example: A. Habib Ahmed v. M. K. G. Scott Christian and others (PLD 1992 SC 353); Abdul 
Ahad v. Amjad Ali and others (PLD 2006 SC 771); and Sajjad Hussain Mukhi v. The State and others 
(2014 SCMR 1741). 

Crl. Misc. No. 60825/M/2021

stay the criminal proceedings till the decision of the civil case. The 
Supreme Court observed that the prosecution case was not based on the 
disputed receipt alone. Four witnesses also supported it. In the 
circumstances, the Special Court could determine the document’s 
authenticity by comparing the petitioner’s signature with the one on the 
receipt or by seeking an expert opinion. The question whether the accused 
was guilty has to be decided on the basis of the ocular and documentary 
evidence produced during the trial. The apex Court also pointed out that a 
civil court’s judgment was not admissible in criminal proceedings to 
establish the truth of the facts upon which it was rendered. The petitioner’s 
request for a stay of proceedings was declined. 
14. 
 
In M. Aslam Zaheer v. Ch. Shah Muhammad and another 
(2003 SCMR 1691), the complainant instituted a private complaint under 
sections 420, 468, and 471 PPC against the respondents alleging that they 
had removed the machinery lying in the warehouse without his permission. 
The Additional Sessions Judge summoned them to stand trial. The High 
Court noted that the parties had signed an agreement with an arbitration 
clause for resolving disputes between them. It, therefore, held that criminal 
action was not maintainable and quashed the summoning order. The 
Hon'ble Supreme Court overturned that decision holding that criminal 
liability is always treated separately from civil liability. 
15. 
 
In Seema Fareed and others v. The State and another 
(2008 SCMR 839), the parties entered into a building and land 
development contract. During the course of business, disputes arose 
between them. Following the development of land and the booking of 
plots/flats, the respondent was issued seven crossed cheques for 
Rs.1,00,000/- each. All of these were dishonoured upon which he lodged 
FIR under sections 420, 406, 114, 109, 34 & 489-F PPC. The High Court 
found that the ingredients of the offences alleged against the petitioners 
were, prima facie, made out and refused to quash the FIR. It held that it 
would “neither be just nor fair and proper” to stifle the criminal 
proceedings at the nascent stage. The Supreme Court agreed and observed: 
“It is well-settled that a criminal case must be allowed to proceed on its 
own merits, and merely because civil proceedings relating to the same 
transaction have been instituted it has never been considered to be a legal 
bar to the maintainability of criminal proceedings which can proceed 

Crl. Misc. No. 60825/M/2021

concurrently because conviction for a criminal offence is altogether a 
different matter from the civil liability. While the spirit and purpose of 
criminal proceedings is to punish the offender for the commission of a 
crime the purpose behind the civil proceedings is to enforce civil rights 
arising out of contracts and in law both the proceedings can co-exist and 
proceed with simultaneously without any legal restriction.” 
16. 
 
In Muhammad Tariq v. Additional Sessions Judge, 
Dunyapur, and others (2012 PCr.LJ 285), the petitioner instituted a suit 
for the specific performance of a sale agreement involving a landed 
property. The private respondent lodged FIR against him under sections 
420, 468 & 471 PPC claiming that the sale agreement was forged. The 
petitioner argued that criminal proceedings should be stayed until the civil 
matter was decided and resumed if the agreement was proven to be 
fabricated. The High Court held that the pendency of the civil suit does not 
preclude criminal proceedings. It reasoned that the petitioner could not 
profit from his own wrong. The civil case usually takes a long time to 
conclude, sometimes over several years. If someone commits a cognizable 
offence, he should not be spared and allowed to reap the benefits of his 
wrongdoing for an extended period of time, depriving the aggrieved person 
of his valuable rights. If a person prepares a forged document and then files 
a suit for specific performance based on it, he cannot be excused from 
criminal liability because refusing to initiate criminal action against him 
would perpetuate an illegality.5 
17. 
 
In 
Muhammad 
Aslam 
v. 
The 
State 
and 
others  
(2017 SCMR 390), the private respondent had given an indemnity bond 
accompanied by post-dated cheques to a financial institution in respect of a 
loan that it extended to his son to study abroad. When his son returned to 
Pakistan, the respondent filed a civil suit, claiming that the indemnity bond 
and post-dated cheques were unenforceable because he had given them 
under duress. Meanwhile, the educational institution presented one of the 
cheques for payment through its bank which was dishonoured, prompting it 
to lodge FIR under section 489-F PPC. The Supreme Court pointed out that 
the subjects of the civil suit and the criminal case were distinct. The former 
concerned the educational institution’s authority to amend its rules and 
                                          
5 Also see: Abdul Qadir Khan Mamdot v. Regional Police Officer, Multan, and others (2011 MLD 1773) 
Mst. Parveen Bibi v. Justice of Peace, Tehsil Mailsi, District Vehari, and others (2012 PCr.LJ 8) and 
Allah Ditta v. Additional Sessions Judge, Sheikhupura, and others (PLD 2011 Lahore 246).

their application to the respondent’s son. On the other hand, the criminal 
case was about the dishonest issuance of a cheque and its dishonouring and 
regarding the respondent’s criminal liability in that regard. The apex Court 
allowed the appeal and directed that the criminal proceedings continue. 
18. 
 
In Dr. Sikandar Ali Mohi ud Din v. Station House Officer 
and others (2021 SCMR 1486), the appellant purchased a piece of land in 
Mauza Gohawa. The respondent asserted ownership on a portion of the 
same Khasra through a separate sale deed dated 22.4.2003 executed on the 
basis of Fard Malkiat No. 942. The appellant filed a complaint with the 
DCO alleging that the Fard Malkiat was forged. The latter appointed an 
inquiry officer who determined that the accusation was true. Thereupon, 
the appellant lodged FIR against the respondent, which the High Court 
quashed since civil litigation was in progress. On appeal, the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court held that the matter was criminal and that the DCO’s 
inquiry and the police investigation both established that the respondent 
had committed a crime. The criminal case could not be closed with a single 
stroke of the pen merely because civil litigation was pending. Criminal and 
civil proceedings can co-exist if the legal foundation is robust. 
19. 
 
The following principles may be deduced from the cases cited 
above:6 
(i) 
The object of civil proceedings is to enforce the civil 
rights of the people, while the purpose of criminal 
proceedings is to punish the offender for committing an 
offence. 
(ii) 
The High Court has jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 
Constitution and section 561-A Cr.P.C. to stay criminal 
proceedings to meet the ends of justice where civil 
litigation is pending. 
(iii) 
No universal rule says that if the subject matter of a 
civil suit and a criminal case is the same or similar, the 
criminal proceedings must be automatically stayed. 
(iv) 
The decision to stay the criminal proceedings is entirely 
at the court’s discretion. The guiding principle, 
however, is whether the accused would be prejudiced if 
the proceedings continue. If his criminal liability is 
dependent on the outcome of civil litigation or is so 
inextricably linked with it that there is a danger of grave 
                                          
6 Meera Shafi etc. v. Federation of Pakistan etc. (PLD 2022 Lahore 773). 

Crl. Misc. No. 60825/M/2021 
 
- 10 -
injustice if there is a conflict of decisions, criminal 
proceedings must be held in abeyance. 
(v) 
If prima facie an offence has been committed, the 
ordinary course of the trial should not be impeded by 
resorting to the High Court’s constitutional jurisdiction 
or the provisions of section 561-A Cr.P.C. 
The case at hand 
20. 
 
This is not a case where one party relies on a sale agreement 
and has filed a suit for its specific performance in the civil court while the 
other claims it is fake. It is also distinguishable from the case of Malik 
Khuda Bakhsh7 discussed above. It has its peculiar facts which are given 
below. 
21. 
 
Respondent No.2 claims that Sale Deed No.8247 dated 
06.08.1996 is bogus. The Petitioner has produced documents which prima 
facie show that on 03.12.1995 Shah Muhammad executed an agreement 
with the Petitioner in respect of the land measuring 03 kanals 15 marlas 
and agreed to sell it to him for Rs.616,000/- He received Rs.100,000/- as 
earnest money, of which Rs.50,000/- was in cash and the remainder in two 
cheques of Rs.25,000/- each drawn on the MCB Bank Limited, Township 
Branch, Lahore. The same day, i.e. on 03.12.1995, Shah Muhammad 
delivered possession of the land to the Petitioner. 
22. 
 
Admittedly, in addition to the above-mentioned land, Shah 
Muhammad sold another land to the Petitioner, his wife Fouqia Tariq, and 
son Bilal Tariq through three other sale deeds. Respondent No.2 did not 
challenge those transactions. The detail of those sale deeds is as follows: 
(i) 
Sale Deed No.3333, Book No.1, Volume No.2394, 
registered 
with 
the 
Sub-Registrar, 
Lahore, 
on 
07.04.1996, in respect of land measuring 09 marlas in 
favour of Fouqia Tariq, wife of the Petitioner.  
(ii) 
Sale Deed No.3332, Book No.1, Volume No.2394, 
registered 
with 
the 
Sub-Registrar, 
Lahore, 
on 
07.04.1996, in respect of land measuring 07 marlas in 
favour of Bilal Tariq, son of the Petitioner.  
(iii) 
Sale Deed No.3334, Book No.1, Volume No.2394, 
registered 
with 
the 
Sub-Registrar, 
Lahore, 
on 
07.04.1996, in respect of land measuring 09 marlas in 
favour of the Petitioner.

23. 
 
The Petitioner has submitted a copy of the building plan of 
Pak Board and Paper Mill sanctioned by the competent authority on 
28.03.1996 which includes the disputed land. Shah Muhammad lived for 
12 long years after the registration of Sale Deed No.8247, but neither he 
challenged it nor instituted any proceedings to recover possession of the 
land in question. Respondent No.2 lodged FIR No.652/2017 nine years 
after his death. 
24. 
 
Respondent No.2 maintains that she came to know about the 
registration of Sale Deed No.8247 on 12.04.2017 through the Halqa 
Patwari when the Petitioner presented it to him for mutation. However, the 
record contradicts her. It shows that she filed a complaint about the said 
sale deed with Police Station Liaquatabad in 2012. Mahmood Ali/SI 
conducted an extensive inquiry and it was disposed of as a result of his 
findings. 
25. 
 
This is not all. Shah Muhammad had mortgaged the land to 
Sajjad Hussain etc., and failed to redeem that mortgage within 60 years. 
Resultantly, Sajjad Hussain etc. filed a suit seeking a declaration that his 
title had been extinguished and that they had become its owners. On 
07.07.1994, the said suit was decreed ex parte. Respondent No.2 applied 
under section 12(2) CPC to have it set aside, but the civil court dismissed 
his application on 05.11.2015. Respondent No.2 assailed that order in 
revision, which the Additional District Judge dismissed on 17.08.2020. 
According to Mr. Jhoja, the judgment and decree dated 07.07.1994 has 
attained finality, and Respondent No.2 has no right or interest in the 
aforementioned land. 
26. 
 
On 29.06.2011, the Petitioner filed a suit against Respondent 
No.2 seeking a declaration regarding his title and permanent injunction. On 
02.05.2017, the latter instituted a lawsuit against the Petitioner for 
cancellation of Sale Deed No.8247. Earlier, she got sanctioned Mutations 
No.19206 and 19916 regarding the inheritance of Shah Muhammad in 
respect of Khasra Nos. 510 and 511 of Mauza Pindi Rajputan. Then, on 
08.12.2015, she filed a suit for possession (along with permanent 
injunction) against the Petitioner regarding land measuring 07 kanals  
03 marlas comprised in those khasras which was decreed ex parte on 

Crl. Misc. No. 60825/M/2021 
 
- 12 -
26.04.2016. The Petitioner has filed an application under Order XXI Rule 
99 & 103 read with section 151 CPC objecting to the execution of that 
decree. All these proceedings are currently pending. 
27. 
 
The dispute between the Petitioner and Respondent No.2 
involves intricate questions of law and facts. Prima facie, the eligibility of 
Respondent No.2 to lodge FIR No.652/2017 is also contingent on the 
outcome of the civil litigation.   
28. 
 
Mr. Buttar’s main thrust is on Report No.291991 dated 
23.08.2017 of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency which, according to 
him, establishes that Sale Deed No.8247 is forged and proves that the 
Petitioner is guilty of the alleged offence. The said report concludes as 
follows: 
“After a complete examination, six questioned thumb impressions 
marked as Q-1, Q-2, Q-3, Q-4, Q-5, and Q-6 under the name of Shah 
Muhammad on “Baye Nama, Dastawaiz No.8247” (Item No.1) found to 
be non-genuine/forged impressions. 
“Hence, six questioned thumb impressions marked as Q-1, Q-2, Q-3, Q-
4, Q-5, and Q-6 under the name of Shah Muhammad are 
non-genuine/forged impressions therefore comparison cannot be 
conducted.”

Articles 61, 78, and 100 of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, are 
relevant to the discourse. Article 61 addresses the circumstance in which 
the court must form an opinion about the person who wrote or signed a 
document. It states that the opinion of any person acquainted with the 
handwriting of the person by whom it is supposed to be written or signed is 
a relevant fact. Article 78 deals with the proof of a person’s signature and 
handwriting. It stipulates that if a question arises whether a document has 
been signed or written by a certain person, his signature or handwriting, as 
the case may be, on that document must be proved. Article 100 attaches 
some presumptions to thirty years old documents.

Parliament has recently amended section 510 Cr.P.C. through 
the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2022,8 and made the 
report of the forensic scientist and the handwriting expert admissible     per 
se. As a result, their reports may be used as evidence in an inquiry, trial, or 
other proceedings without calling them to the witness box. However, the

court may summon and examine that expert if it is necessary for justice. 
Even before the aforesaid amendment, the jurisprudence was that the 
handwriting expert’s opinion was relevant but was a weak type of 
evidence. It should not be treated as conclusive evidence to prove a fact. 
Reliance is placed upon Syed Ali Nawaz Gardezi v. Lt.-Col. Muhammad 
Yusuf (PLD 1963 SC 51); Mst. Saadat Sultan and others v. Muhammad 
Zahur Khan and others (2006 SCMR 193); Muhammad Ishaque Qureshi 
v. Sajid Ali Khan and another (2016 SCMR 192); Wajeeh-ul-Hassan v. 
The State (2019 SCMR 1994); and Muhammad Samiullah v. The State 
(2022 SCMR 998).

The superior courts have considered section 510 Cr.P.C. in 
several cases. Albeit these were decided before the above-mentioned 
amendment, the principle enunciated by them fully applies to the reports of 
the forensic scientist and the handwriting expert in the current framework. 
In Sardar Ali v. Judge Special Court, Multan, and another  
(1996 MLD 460), the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held: 
“Applying the above principle to the facts and circumstances of this case 
we have no hesitation to hold that the report submitted  by the firearm 
expert cannot be treated as a circumstance, leading to inference that no 
unlicenced Kalashnikov recovered from the accused was used in the 
commission of the offence. The allegation of use of the aforenoted 
weapons is mentioned in the supplementary statement of the complainant, 
the statement of the prosecution witnesses. The question as to whether any 
reliance can be placed upon these reports is to be answered by the trial 
Court on recording the evidence of the parties and after dealing with the 
aforenoted report within the terms of section 510 Cr.P.C. No doubt any 
report of the Chemical Examiner or Assistant Chemical Examiner to 
Government or of the Chief Chemist of the Pakistan Security Printing 
Corporation Ltd., or any Serologist, the fingerprint expert or firearm expert 
appointed by Government upon any matter or thing duly submitted to him 
for examination or analysis, can be used as evidence in any inquiry, trial or 
other proceedings under Cr.P.C. Such opinion is one of the species of 
evidence and the court had been given powers to summon such person for 
the purpose of examination. The proviso to section 510 Cr.P.C. makes it 
amply clear that any such opinion is of no conclusive and decisive 
significance and has to be assessed by the trial court.” 
32. 
 
An expert’s report, even if it is from a handwriting expert, is 
still an opinion that can be erroneous. Hence, it is not immune from judicial 
scrutiny. It’s worth is determined by the expert’s reasoning for reaching his 
conclusion. While interpreting section 510 Cr.P.C. (and the above-
mentioned amendment), on the one hand, we must distinguish between the 
admissibility and the procedure for adducing the handwriting expert’s 
report in evidence and, on the other hand, its probative value. The law only 

Crl. Misc. No. 60825/M/2021 
 
- 14 -
makes the report admissible without the expert’s examination, but it is not 
conclusive evidence. The probative value of the report must depend upon a 
variety of circumstances. 
33. 
 
I conclude that any such opinion mentioned in section 510 
Cr.P.C. is not conclusive and must be evaluated by the court. 
34. 
 
The forensic report referred to by Mr. Buttar in the present 
case is unclear. It has generated more questions than answers. The 
authenticity of Sale Deed No.8247 cannot be determined without a proper 
trial by the civil court where lawsuits of both sides are pending. It is just 
and appropriate that the proceedings in FIR No.652/2017 be stayed till the 
final decision of the civil cases. Order accordingly. 
35. 
 
This petition is accepted and the impugned orders dated 
16.06.2021 and 17.09.2021 are set aside.
