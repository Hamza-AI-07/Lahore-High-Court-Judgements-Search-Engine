Date of Hearing: 
23.02.2024 
Appellant by: 
Mr. Muhammad Masood Bilal, 
Advocate. 
Respondents No.1 and 
3 by: 
Ch. Waqas Ahmad, Advocate. 
Respondent No.2 by: 
Proceeded ex-parte on 24.10.2022. 
 
      Anwaar Hussain, J.  This regular first appeal is directed against 
consolidated judgment and decree dated 08.03.2022 through which the 
suit for recovery of amount of Rs.3,554,262/- on the basis of cheque, 
under order XXXVII Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
1908 (“CPC”) instituted by respondent No.1 (“respondent”) has been 
decreed and the suit instituted by the appellant, for cancellation of the 
said cheque was dismissed.  
2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that in plaint of 
his suit, the respondent averred that the respondent had good business 
relations with the appellant who used to purchase the agricultural 
products from the respondent and in furtherance of one such 
transaction, wheat was purportedly purchased in the year 2016 and     
the impugned  cheque bearing CD No.0093205 dated  05.12.2016   was

issued, which, on presentation, was dishonoured. Criminal proceedings 
were also initiated in terms of registration of case under Section 489-F 
of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860. The appellant also filed a suit for 
cancellation of the impugned cheque with the averments that the 
cheque was issued to one Muhammad Altaf (respondent No.2) who 
was employee of the respondent, as a guarantee cheque for payment on 
account of the ongoing business transaction(s), and the specific 
transaction was fully paid in cash (Rs.16,250/-) and through voucher 
No.JRV 27 dated 05.12.2016 Rs.3,538,113/-. It is case of the appellant 
that the impugned cheque was misused and therefore, liable to be 
cancelled. Both the suits were consolidated and after framing of the 
consolidated issues and recording of evidence adduced by the parties, 
the suit of the respondent was decreed, whereas, the suit of the 
appellant was dismissed.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the evidence has 
been misread inasmuch as during the criminal trial, in respect of the 
same cheque, the respondent appeared and categorically recorded his 
statement that payment in respect of the transaction underlying the 
issuance of the impugned cheque had been received by his above-
referred Manager, Muhammad Altaf and this statement was brought on 
record as Exh.D-2 before the Trial Court and the respondent, when 
confronted with the said statement categorically acknowledged its 
correctness, therefore, documentary evidence available on record 
clearly depicted that the impugned cheque was issued as a guarantee 
cheque and was misused, hence, liable to be cancelled, which fact has 
escaped notice of the Trial Court.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent has supported the 
impugned judgment and decree, whereas, respondent No.2 has been 
proceeded ex-parte on 24.10.2022. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.

6. 
In the light of the factual matrix of the case, following points of 
determination can be formulated for opinion of this Court: 
(i)  
Whether the appellant was able to rebut the 
presumption of correctness attached to the 
impugned cheque, issued by the appellant, by 
putting forth probable defence and leading credible 
evidence, shifting the burden upon the respondent 
to prove the issuance of cheque in respect of a 
particular transaction entered into by Muhammad 
Altaf- the Manager of the respondent? and 
(ii) 
if the answer to above quoted question is in 
affirmative,  whether the respondent was able to 
prove that the impugned cheque was not given as 
guarantee for clearance of any balance amount, 
due in favour of the respondent, on account of 
ongoing business dealings between the parties but 
was issued to clear the amount due in respect of 
the disputed transaction? 
7. 
Admittedly, the signatures on the cheque are not denied. The 
crucial aspect of the matter is to ascertain whether the respondent 
received the amount due pertaining to a particular transaction that was 
admittedly entered by the appellant with respondent No.2/the Manager 
of the respondent, namely, Muhammad Altaf in respect of which the 
respondent claims that the impugned cheque was issued. There is also 
no denial that a criminal case was registered on the basis of the same 
cheque (and the transaction) and after a full-fledge trial, the appellant 
has been acquitted and the respondent admitted therein that payment in 
respect of the disputed transaction was cleared by the appellant. There 
is no doubt that standard of evidence to prove a civil case is different 
from the evidence required to convict an accused in a criminal case. In 
civil cases, it is preponderance of evidence on the basis of which a 
dispute is to be decided, however, it does not mean that the conclusion 
in civil cases based on same set of facts is drawn mechanically, 
ignoring the crucial piece of evidence available on record such as 
statement of the plaintiff during the criminal trial, having direct nexus

RFA No.258 of 2022 
 
 
with the dispute. Issues No.1 and 4 were core issues and the same read 
as under: 
1. 
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree for 
recovery of Rs.3,554,262/- as prayed for? OPP 
2. 
…… 
3. 
…… 
4. 
Whether the defendant is entitled to the decree for 
declaration/cancellation of cheque No.CD0093205 dated 
05.12.2016, amounting to Rs.3,554,362/- as prayed for? 
OPD 
While deciding the said issues, against the appellant, the Trial Court 
has observed as under: 
“18………In the entire evidence brought in the witness 
box only one witness defendant Malik Muhammad 
Ashraf himself appeared as DW-1 whereas remaining 
documentary evidence was produced in the Court. The 
only single oral recorded witness of Malik Muhammad 
Ashraf had admitted the business transaction and named 
the impugned cheque as one of that guarantee and he 
further stated that same cheque was required to be 
returned since the same was issued as guarantee. In order 
to get the corroboration, independent witness was 
required to prove whether the same was guarantee 
cheque or not but no evidence was brought. Similarly, 
even in the single recorded oral evidence, this issue was 
not properly pressed and cancellation of cheque was not 
demanded in the evidence. Similarly, the documents were 
produced, according to which it has nowhere been 
written that the cheque was a guarantee cheque and it 
remained only oral assertion.” 
8. 
The conclusion drawn by the Trial Court is erroneous as the 
appellant brought on record the documentary evidence in the form of 
statement of the respondent in criminal trial relating to the impugned 
cheque, which the respondent claimed to have been issued to clear the 
payment due in respect of the disputed transaction entered into by the 
appellant with the above referred Muhammad Altaf. Statement of the 
respondent in criminal case (Exh.D-1) reads as under:

Above quoted statement of the respondent (Exh.D-1) depicts that there 
might have been multiple transactions between the appellant and the 
respondent, in respect of the wheat and/or other agricultural products, 
however, it is well evident that the respondent claims that the 
impugned cheque was issued for the discharge of obligation pertaining 
to a particular transaction in respect of which the respondent has not 
given any specific date, however, the amount was admittedly cleared 
and the same was recorded in voucher No.JRV 27 dated 05.12.2016, 
which is precisely the stance/defence of the appellant in the present 
case. When the amount due was admittedly cleared, there appears to be 
no reason for issuance of the impugned cheque in respect of same 
transaction. Once the probable defence in the form of Exh.D-1 was 
available on record, it was for the respondent to prove that there was 
some other transaction between the respondent and the appellant that 
remained unpaid and the impugned cheque or the voucher dated 
05.12.2016 was issued for the other transaction and not the disputed 
transaction. On a pointed question by this Court, learned counsel for 
the respondent acknowledged that nothing was available on record to 
substantiate that the impugned cheque was issued by the appellant for 
any other transaction entered into by the appellant and said Muhammad

RFA No.258 of 2022 
 
 
Altaf or the respondent. Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that the 
Trial Court erred in appreciating the crucial factual aspect of the matter 
and the documentary evidence (Exh.D-1) thereof has been erroneously 
ignored. 
9. 
It is settled principle of appraising evidence that the statement of 
a witness must be consistent with the circumstances of the case before 
the same is believed and relied upon. The preceding discussion makes 
it amply clear that as on 05.12.2016 there was only one transaction, 
entered into between the appellant and Muhammad Altaf, Manager of 
the respondent, in respect of which the respondent claims that the 
impugned cheque was issued, however, the respondent side could not 
refute that the payment in respect of the said transaction was cleared 
through voucher dated 05.12.2016, which propels to conclude that the 
impugned cheque was lying with the respondent side as guarantee on 
account of the admitted business relationship of purchase of wheat to 
secure any balance due and despite receiving payment in respect of the 
disputed transaction, the impugned cheque has been misused. 
10. 
In view of the above discussion, this Court is of the opinion that 
the Trial Court has not correctly decided the core issues, misread the 
evidence on record and erred in decreeing the suit of the respondent 
and dismissing the suit of appellant. Therefore, the present appeal 
merits acceptance and hence, allowed. As a natural corollary, the suit 
of the respondent is dismissed whereas the suit of the appellant is 
decreed. No order as to cost.
