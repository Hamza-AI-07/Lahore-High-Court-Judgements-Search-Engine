2. 
Notices were issued and report has been filed by the 
learned Members of the Judicial Water and Environmental 
Commission regarding a scheme sought to be launched by the 
Government of Punjab to provide motorcycles to the students. 
Under the scheme the proposal is to provide 23000 bikes to the 
students of which 19000 would be petrol bikes (The Scheme). 
This raised concerns regarding environment pollution and 
adverse impact on the environment by induction of a large 
number of motorcycles in the traffic pattern of Punjab. It is 
made clear that this issue has engaged the attention of this 
Court purely because of environmental concerns which strictly 
affects the right to life enshrined in Article 9 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Two reports 
have been filed on behalf of Transport & Masstransit 
Department, Government of Punjab. To reiterate, this Court is 

                                                W.P. No.30823/2024

not concerned with the other aspects of the scheme which is 
within the domain of the Government but merely relates to the 
impact on environment by the launch of the scheme. Different 
applications were filed which have now been converted into 
instant constitutional petitions and which are being heard and 
disposed of together.  
3. 
Learned Advocate General Punjab on the last date of 
hearing as well as learned Assistant Advocate General have 
been heard today as also the Secretary Transport and 
Masstransit Department, Government of Punjab have been 
heard in the matter. There are various reports placed on the 
record filed by the Urban Unit, Government of Punjab as well 
as World Bank and other Multilateral Agencies which establish 
in different studies that of the various factors vehicular 
emission constitutes the largest proportion of pollution being 
caused. Out of the entire bulk of vehicular emission, the major 
contributor to pollution is the emission by motorcycles. 
Therefore, it should be of deep concern for any reasonable 
Government to engage in a priorly conducted feasibility study 
regarding impact of induction of thousands of motorcycles 
into the mainstream traffic of Punjab.  
4. 
The Punjab Environmental Protection Act, 1997 (“Act, 
1997”) 
assumes 
significance 
in 
this 
regard. 
Adverse 
environmental effect has been defined as: 
“(i) 
“adverse environmental effect” means impairment 
of, or damage to, the environment and includes— 
(a) 
impairment of, or damage to, human health and 
safety or to biodiversity or property; 
(b) 
pollution; and  
(c) 
any adverse environmental effect as may be specified 
in the regulations;”   
 
5. 
Project in the Act, 1997 means: 
“project” means any activity, plan, scheme, proposal or 
undertaking involving any change in the environment and 
includes–               
(a)  construction by use of buildings or other  
      works;                         
(b)  construction or use of roads or other transport     

                                                W.P. No.30823/2024

       systems; 
(c)  construction or operation of factories or other   
       installations: 
(d)  mineral prospecting, mining, quarrying, stone- 
       crushing, drilling and the like; 
          (e)  any change of land use or water use; and 
           (f)  alteration, expansion, repair, decommissioning or  
      abandonment of existing buildings or other works,  
       roads or other transport systems, factories or other  
      installations;” 
6. 
Lastly, proponent has been defined as: 
“proponent” means the person who proposes or 
intends to undertake a project; 
 
7. 
A cumulative reading of these definitions would clearly 
show that a project would mean any activity, plan, scheme or 
undertaking involving any change in the environment. 
Doubtless, the scheme being proposed by the Government is 
such a scheme and would involve a change in the environment 
and there can be no two opinions about this aspect. The launch 
of the scheme would be caught by the definition of adverse 
environmental effect and would cause pollution and 
impairment of human health and safety. Since the scheme is 
definitely a project within the meaning of the Act, 1997, this 
would trigger Section 12 which provides that: 
“12.  
Initial environmental examination and environmental 
impact assessment.– (1) No proponent of a project shall commence 
construction or operation unless he has filed with the Provincial 
Agency an initial environmental examination or where the project 
is likely to cause an adverse environmental effect, an environmental 
impact assessment, and has obtained from the Provincial Agency 
approval in respect thereof. 
(2)  The Provincial Agency shall– 
(a) review the initial environmental examination and accord 
its approval, or require submission of an environmental 
impact assessment by the proponent; or 
(b)  review the environmental impact assessment and 
accord its approval subject to such conditions as it may 
deem fit to impose, or require that the environmental impact 
assessment be re-submitted after such modifications as may 
be stipulated, or reject the project as being contrary to 
environmental objectives. 
 (3)  Every review of an environmental impact assessment shall be 
carried out with public participation and no information will be 
disclosed during the course of such public participation which 
relates to– 
(i) 
trade, manufacturing or business activities, processes or 
techniques of a proprietary nature, or financial, commercial, 

                                                W.P. No.30823/2024 
4
scientific or technical matters which the proponent has requested 
should remain confidential, unless for reasons to be recorded in 
writing, the Director - General of the Provincial Agency is of the 
opinion that the request for confidentiality is not well-founded or 
the public interest in the disclosure outweighs the possible 
prejudice to the competitive position of the project or its 
proponent; or  
(ii)  
 International relations, national security or maintenance of law 
and order, except with the consent of the Government; or 
(iii)  matters covered by legal professional privilege. 
(4)  The Provincial Agency shall communicate its approval or 
otherwise within a period of four months from the date the initial 
environmental examination or environmental impact assessment is 
filed complete in all respects in accordance with the prescribed 
procedure, failing which the initial environmental examination or, 
as the case may be, the environmental impact assessment shall be 
deemed to have been approved, to the extent to which it does not 
contravene the provisions of this Act and the rules and regulations 
made thereunder. 
(5)  Subject to sub-section (4) the Government may in a particular 
case extend the aforementioned period of four months if the nature 
of the project so warrants. 
(6)  The provisions of sub-sections (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) shall 
apply to such categories of projects and in such manner as may be 
prescribed. 
(7)  The Provincial Agency shall maintain separate Registers for 
initial environmental examination and environmental impact 
assessment project, which shall contain brief particulars of each 
project and a summary of decisions taken thereon, and which shall 
be open to inspection by the public at all reasonable hours and the 
disclosure of information in such Registers shall be subject to the 
restrictions specified in sub-section (3).” 
 
8. 
The provisions set out above is couched in mandatory 
terms and prohibits any project to commence unless an 
environmental impact assessment has been filed with the 
Provincial Agency whose approval has been obtained in this 
regard. This, a fortiori, applies to a scheme or undertaking by 
the Government and is of the essence of a responsible 
Government. This has admittedly not been done by the 
Transport Department while formulating the scheme and 
obtaining its approval from the Government. The Secretary 
present in the Court does not dispute the applicability of the 
Act, 1997 under these circumstances. Finally, section 19 makes 
it an offence for any Government Agency to proceed with the 
implementation of the scheme without the approval of the 
Provincial Agency and the head of that Government Agency 

                                                W.P. No.30823/2024

will be directly liable for being punished under the provisions 
of the Act, 1997. Therefore, it can be culled out from the above 
narration of the provisions of Act, 1997 that an Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA) as a sine qua non was to be submitted 
by the Transport Department with regard to the scheme to the 
Provincial Agency and an approval had to be obtained priorly 
before the scheme was formally launched. This can still be 
done by the Transport Department which is under obligation 
to do so.  
9. 
In view of the above, these petitions are disposed of 
with a direction that before the scheme is formally put into 
effect and the distribution of petrol motorcycles takes place, an 
EIA shall be submitted to the Provincial Agency for its 
approval in accordance with law. Once that approval has been 
granted, this scheme may proceed ahead. It is further made 
clear that the Provincial Agency shall engage private and 
independent consultants to review the EIA so submitted and 
thereafter proceed to grant or refuse approval on the basis of 
the recommendations. The fee of the independent consultants 
shall be borne by the Transport Department. Until the 
approval is granted, the scheme shall be held in abeyance and 
no further steps shall be taken by the Transport and 
Masstransit Department with regard to the scheme.
