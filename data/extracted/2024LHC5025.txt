Anwaar Hussain, J. The petitioner, appointed as constable, is 
member of Punjab Police and later on applied for the post of Sub-
Inspector,  on 07.11.2020, through application bearing No.47100596 
and qualified the written examination, interview as well as medical 
test and admittedly, was recommended for the post of Sub-Inspector, 
by the Punjab Public Service Commission (“the PPSC”) whereafter 
appointment order dated 03.08.2023 was issued, however, during the 
process of scrutiny/verification of the antecedents, it transpired that a 
criminal case bearing FIR No.269/2023 dated 16.06.2023, under 
Section 392 Pakistan Penal  Code, 1860, was registered with the 
Police Station Murree, Rawalpindi and hence, on the instructions of 
Inspector General of Police, Punjab/respondent No.2, vide impugned 
order dated 30.04.2024, the appointment of the petitioner was 
withdrawn.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that appointment of 
the petitioner has been withdrawn on the basis of an FIR registered 
against him, in which, the petitioner has been found innocent during 
the departmental inquiry and the petitioner has also been acquitted as 
his application under Section 249-A of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898 (“Cr.P.C”), has been allowed and therefore, the 
Date of Hearing: 
29.10.2024 
Petitioner(s) by: 
Syed Anjum Abbas, Advocate.  
 
Respondent(s) 
by: 
Mr. Imran Shaukat Rao, Assistant Advocate 
General alongwith Hassan Askari, Inspector  

 
 
W.P No.1802/2024 
2 
 
 
 
impugned order dated 30.04.2024, is liable to be set aside and the 
petitioner be allowed to join his duty as Sub-Inspector.  
3. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer alongwith departmental 
representative has not denied that the FIR was registered after 
submission of the application and the petitioner was found innocent 
during the departmental inquiry, however, asserts that subsequently 
another inquiry was conducted wherein he was found guilty, 
therefore, the impugned order was justly passed. The departmental 
representative could not deny that the petitioner’s application under 
Section 249-A, Cr.P.C was accepted, vide order dated 18.12.2023, 
and he was acquitted from the case registered as FIR No.269/2023, 
by the Court of competent jurisdiction, which order has attained 
finality. 
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
Perusal of the record reveals that after thoroughly examining 
the record of the investigation, carried out by the police officials, 
learned Magistrate Section 30, Murree, vide order dated 18.12.2023 
held as under: 
“4. 
From the perusal of the file accused persons 
are nominated in the F.I.R. with the assertions that he 
knew the names of the accused persons from the 
locality but I.O. did not associate any inhabitants of 
the locality to identify the accused persons 
regarding said occurrence and no identification 
parade has been conducted to identify the accused 
persons with specific role in the instant case. … 
Moreover, no recovery has been effected from 
accused Ehtisham Ali. 
5. 
… 
6. 
… 
7. 
Keeping in view the facts and circumstances 
discussed above, this court would not hesitate to say 
that there is no probability of conviction of accused 
persons, if even entire remaining evidence be 
recorded and thus they are acquitted from the 
instant case, under Section 249-A Cr.P.C.”

Moreover, before the acquittal of the petitioner, regular departmental 
inquiry was held and report bearing No.PA/723/PD dated 15.08.2023 
by the Superintendent of Police, Potohar Division, Rawalpindi, was 
prepared and submitted with following conclusion/findings: 
“CONCLUSION/FINDINGS 
 
By considering/examining all the relevant 
papers i.e. charge sheets, written reply to charge 
sheets submitted by above said official and progress 
report as well as other circumstances of the cases, it 
transpired that during investigation of case FIR 
No.269 dated 16.06.23 u/s 392 PC  PS Murree, 
weapon of offence used in the occurrence has been 
recovered from Saim Tariq Abbasi and Hammad 
Sarwar and on the pointation of Hammad Sarwar, car 
No.ED708 used in the commission of crime has also 
been recovered and nothing has been recovered from 
Constable Ehtisham Ali. During enquiry it revealed 
that constable Ehtisham Ali No.4023 went to 
Kashmir point on the call of Hammad Sarwar being 
ex constable (colleague) but he was not participated 
in the said commission of crime. Prima facie, 
constable Ehtisham Ali No.4023 seems not found 
involved case FIR No.269 dated 16.06.23 PC PS 
Murree,…” 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
   
Though there is no bar as to holding of the second inquiry, however, 
on a pointed question put by this Court, learned Law Officer as also 
the departmental representative could not refer to and/or put-forth 
any material reasons that prompted the initiation of the second 
inquiry, which also reflects negativity qua the merits of the impugned 
order. In addition, the respondent-department failed to substantiate 
that the petitioner was associated with the second inquiry, which runs 
counter to the principle of natural justice and due process embodied 
under Article 10-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (“the Constitution”). In this manner, the respondent-
department seems to have fallen in error. Since the Court of 
competent jurisdiction, i.e., Magistrate Section 30, has clearly found 

 
 
W.P No.1802/2024 
4 
 
 
 
that necessary material for commission of alleged offence is not 
made out from the facts of the case in addition to the fact that 
complainant of the case was also not interested to prosecute the case, 
therefore, in such an eventuality, the impugned order is without any 
lawful basis. 
6. 
The matter can be examined from another angle. This Court in 
exercise of judicial review can look into and determine the 
reasonableness of a particular policy as well as the impact of the 
applicability thereof, particularly, if such policy has a bearing on the 
fundamental right–to prosper, through appointment to a particular 
post, forming part of right to quality life by participating in 
competitive process for selection to a particular post. The underlying 
rationale of the policy of the respondent-department to withdraw 
appointment as Sub-Inspector from a Constable who is found in a 
criminal act–registration of case, seems to maintain discipline in the 
force by shunning out such candidates who could potentially be 
troublesome for the discipline. In the instant case, strangely and 
ironically enough, the petitioner found to be involved in FIR can 
perform his duties as a Constable, by remaining part of the force but 
cannot be offered appointment as Sub-Inspector – a position that the 
petitioner earned through hard work and his intellectual abilities, 
which otherwise is appreciable and laudable that the petitioner 
accepted the post (of Constable) in the lower rank when it was 
offered and made his way through hard work and dedication to the 
higher rank (Sub-Inspector) which is reflective of the dynamic aspect 
of the petitioner. Thus, the policy, the underlying rationale and the 
manner in which it has been implemented in the present case create a 
paradoxical situation and conflicting position of the respondent-
department, the answer to which is absent on the part of the 
respondent-department. The petitioner could be or could not be 
troublesome both as Constable and as Sub-Inspector. The impugned 

 
 
W.P No.1802/2024 
5 
 
 
 
order of withdrawal of the appointment amounts to depriving the 
petitioner from the fundamental right of livelihood, as guaranteed 
under the Constitution, which cannot be countenanced.   
7. 
In view of the above discussion, the present petition merits 
acceptance and hence, allowed. As a corollary, the impugned 
withdrawal order dated 30.04.2024 is set aside and the respondents 
are directed to proceed further in accordance with law qua the 
appointment of the petitioner as Sub-Inspector.
