Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. This constitutional petition though arises 
out of concurrent findings of the foras below but it canvasses a pivotal 
question of law, seriously affecting the propriety of impugned decisions. 
2.  
The facts forming background of this petition are that 
respondent No.1 (hereinafter referred to as “respondent”) claiming 
himself to be the landlord of the house No.3, street No.8, Ali Town, Adiala 
Road, Kiani Plaza, Rawalpindi, moved a petition under section 19 of the 
Punjab Rented Premises Act, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 2009”) 
seeking eviction of the petitioner from the ground floor of the house, which 
was rented to him at the monthly rent of Rs.6000/- vide agreement No.4179 
dated 24th January, 2015. It is asserted in the ejectment petition that rent 
agreement expired on 24th January, 2016, which was never renewed and 
after its expiry, the “respondent” has though requested the petitioner to 
vacate the rented premises but he refused. The eviction of the petitioner 
was also sought on the grounds of violation of terms and conditions of rent 
agreement and non-payment of rent at the enhanced rate. 
3.  
The petitioner resisted the ejectment proceedings and moved an 
application seeking leave to contest averring therein that he is occupying 
the premises since 2007 and on 8th July, 2015, fresh rent agreement was

W.P.No.1215 of 2020 
 
 
executed under which the tenancy period is to expire on June, 2025. After 
finding the grounds raised in the application for leave to contest sufficient 
for production of oral evidence, leave was granted and from the divergent 
pleadings of the parties, issues were framed. After framing of issues, 
evidence of both the sides was recorded and finally ejectment petition was 
accepted through order dated 30th October, 2019 directing the petitioner to 
hand over the vacant possession of the rented premises to the 
“respondent” within 30 days. Feeling dissatisfied, the petitioner though 
preferred an appeal before the learned Additional District Judge but his 
appeal was dismissed vide judgment dated 2nd March, 2020, hence this 
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973. 
4.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that while resisting 
the ejectment proceedings, the petitioner has though specifically pleaded 
that a rent agreement dated 8th July, 2015 was entered into between the 
parties wherein tenancy period was to expire in June, 2025 but no issue to 
this effect was framed. He added that despite holding the said tenancy 
agreement as genuine, it was discarded merely on the ground that it was 
not registered under section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908. Learned 
counsel emphasized that while discarding the rent agreement, the appellate 
Court as well as Special Judge (Rent) ignored the mandatory provisions of 
section 9 of the “Act, 2009”. It is argued with vehemence that eviction 
order is not sustainable under the law.  
5.  
Conversely, learned counsel representing the “respondent” 
defended the eviction order and submitted that in view of concurrent 
findings, constitutional petition is not maintainable. 
6.  
Heard. Record perused. 
7.  
The relationship of landlord and tenant interse parties is not in 
dispute. As per stance of the “respondent”, the premises were given to the 
petitioner on rent in the year 2007 on the basis of oral tenancy, which was 
later on, however, reduced into writing in the year 2015 for one year and 
the tenancy thus expired on 24th June, 2016. In order to regulate the 

3 
W.P.No.1215 of 2020 
 
 
relationship of landlord and tenant, to provide a mechanism for settlement 
of their disputes in an expeditious and cost-effective manner and for 
connected matters, the “Act, 2009” was promulgated, which provides a 
detailed mechanism for the settlement of any controversy arising between 
the landlord and tenant. 
8.  
As already observed that the relationship of landlord and tenant 
interse parties is not in dispute. Section 5 of the “Act, 2009” bounds down 
the landlord and tenant to have the tenancy registered with the Rent 
Registrar and reads as under: - 
5. 
Agreement between landlord and tenant.- (1) A 
landlord shall not let out a premises to a tenant except by a tenancy 
agreement. 
(2) 
A landlord shall present the tenancy agreement before the 
Rent Registrar. 
(3) 
The Rent Registrar shall enter the particulars of the 
tenancy in a register, affix his official seal on the tenancy agreement, 
retain a copy thereof and return the original tenancy agreement to the 
landlord. 
(4) 
The entry of particulars of the tenancy shall not absolve 
the landlord or the tenant of their liability to register the tenancy 
agreement under the law relating to registration of documents. 
(5) 
A tenancy agreement entered in the office of a Rent 
Registrar or a certified copy thereof shall be a proof of the relationship 
of landlord and tenant. 
(6) 
Any agreement which may be executed between the 
landlord and the tenant in respect of the premises shall be presented 
before the Rent Registrar in the same manner as provided in sub-section 
(2). 
 
 
(underlining supplied for emphasis) 
9.  
In terms of section 8 of the “Act, 2009”, it is incumbent upon the 
landlord and tenant to bring existing tenancy in conformity with the 
provisions of the “Act, 2009” as early as possible but not later than two 
years from the date of coming into force of the “Act, 2009”. Section 9 of 
the “Act, 2009” provides the consequences if a tenancy does not conform 
to the provisions of the “Act, 2009” and it reads as under: - 
9. 
Effect of non-compliance.- If a tenancy does not conform to the 
provisions of this Act, the Rent Tribunal shall not entertain an 
application under this Act— 

4 
W.P.No.1215 of 2020 
 
 
(a) 
on behalf of the tenant, unless he deposits a fine 
equivalent to five percent of the annual value of the rent 
of the premises in the Government treasury; and 
(b) 
on behalf of the landlord, unless he deposits a fine 
equivalent to ten percent of the annual value of the rent of 
the premises in the Government treasury. 
 
 
(underlining supplied for emphasis) 
10.  
Before adverting to the question involved in this petition, it 
would be advantageous to have a bird eye view on the other provisions 
relevant to the subject. Section 19 of the “Act, 2009” outlines the manner 
of filing of application before the Rent Tribunal, which reads as under: - 
19. 
Filing of application.- (1) 
An application in respect of 
a rented premises shall be filed in the Rent Tribunal of the area or the 
district. 
(2) 
If an application is filed under sub-section (1), the 
Administrative Special Judge (Rent) of the area or the district may take 
cognizance of the case or entrust the same to any other Special Judge 
(Rent). 
(3) 
An application under sub-section (1) shall contain a 
concise statement of facts, the relief claimed and shall be accompanied 
by copies of all relevant documents in possession of the applicant. 
(4) 
If the application is for eviction of a tenant, the landlord 
shall submit his affidavit and affidavits of not more than two witnesses 
along with the eviction application.  
From the bare perusal of the above referred provision of law, it is 
manifestly clear that the term “application” used therein is not restricted 
to the ejectment application, rather it can be any other application falling 
within the domain of Rent Tribunal established under the “Act, 2009”. 
Though the “respondent” captioned the ejectment application under 
section 15 of the “Act, 2009” but in fact, it was an application under 
section 19 as section 15 only provides the grounds for eviction.  
11.  
 Being the special law, the “Act, 2009” also ordains that the 
Rent Tribunal shall not allow a respondent to defend the application unless 
he obtains leave to contest. Sub-section 2 of section 22 of the “Act, 2009” 
mandates that subject to the “Act, 2009”, a respondent shall file an 
application for leave to contest within ten days of his first appearance in 
the Rent Tribunal. The petitioner, in order to contest the ejectment petition, 
moved an application for leave to contest in terms of section 22 of the “Act, 

5 
W.P.No.1215 of 2020 
 
 
2009”, which for all intent and purposes is an application find mention in 
section 9 of the Act ibid, reproduced hereinabove. In his application for 
leave to contest, the petitioner has relied upon the tenancy agreement 
dated 8th July, 2015 i.e. Exh.R-15 to canvass that the tenancy will subsist 
till June, 2025, which was though denied by the “respondent” but it is 
noticed that while pondering upon the tenancy agreement Exh.R-15, the 
Rent Tribunal unequivocally adjudged it as genuine document, which 
findings were even not disbursed by the appellate Court. The tenancy 
agreement was, however, discarded from consideration by the Rent 
Tribunal as well as the appellate Court. It appears that the rent agreement 
Exh.R-15 was not taken into consideration on the ground that it is not in 
conformity with the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and it 
is not registered under section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908. This 
concurrent opinion is completely oblivious and in derogation of mandatory 
provisions of section 9 of the “Act, 2009”.  
12.  
Needless to reiterate that if the tenancy agreement introduced by 
the petitioner in his defence in the application for leave to contest was not 
registered or it was not conforming to the provisions of the “Act, 2009”, 
the Rent Tribunal can, at the most, halt further proceedings in the matter 
and direct the petitioner to pay the penalty in terms of section 9 of the 
“Act, 2009” within specified period of time. If such amount was deposited 
by the petitioner within specified period, his application for leave to 
contest should be proceeded with further and in case of failure, it should 
have been dismissed. Guidance in this respect can be sought from Rana 
ABDUL HAMEED TALIB v. ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, LAHORE 
and others (PLD 2013 Supreme Court 775). The relevant extract from the 
same is reproduced below: - 
“11. 
Now considering the effect of Section 9 with regard and 
reference to the existing tenancies in the context of Section 8, it may be 
mentioned that Ordinance, 2007/Act, 2009 have come into force on 16th 
November,  2007  and  17th  November,  2009  respectively  (see section 
1(3) - it shall come into force at once). From the language of section 8 
(of these laws), it is clear that both the landlord/tenant are statutorily 
duty bound to bring the existing tenancies in conformity with the 
provisions of the said laws, the expression "An existing landlord and 
tenant shall" appearing in the section, leave no room for any other 
interpretation in this behalf. Furthermore, the expression of the section 

6 
W.P.No.1215 of 2020 
 
 
"as soon as possible" postulates that the needful should be done quickly, 
promptly and before long, therefore, for all intents and purposes, the 
date of the enforcement (coming into force) of these laws is the statutory 
starting point of time, for bringing the existing tenancy in conformity 
with the Act, 2009; while in view of the expression "not later than two 
years" the law has prescribed the cutoff date for the purposes of doing 
the 
needful. 
However 
the 
question 
shall 
be; 
whether 
the 
applicant(s)/petitioner(s) having existing tenancy who shall approach the 
Rent Tribunal for the enforcement of his rights under the provisions of 
the Act, 2009, is exempted from the fine for a period of two years; a 
moratorium of two years has been provided to him and/or the section 
shall remain dormant, inapplicable and inactive in such case (existing 
tenancy cases) for two years period and the landlord/tenant may 
approach the Rent Tribunal for the purposes of availing his rights and 
remedies under the Act 2009, but without paying the Fine? In order to 
resolve this proposition(s) we again have to revert to the object and spirit 
of the Act, 2009 as elucidated above (Ordinance, 2007 as well) and also 
keep in view the various provisions of the Act, 2009, to which reference 
has earlier been made, specifically sections 12, 13 and 15. Because 
under these provisions immediately on the coming into force of the laws, 
certain rights and obligations of the landlord and the tenant are conferred 
upon and created, including the entitlement (right) of landlord to seek 
the eviction of the tenant (see section 15) on the grounds, out of which 
some grounds are foundationally dependent on the tenancy agreement, 
such as for example (a) the period of tenancy has expired (b) the tenant 
has committed breach of a term or condition of tenancy agreement; thus 
as upon the enforcement of the Act, 2009 and according to section 35 of 
the said Act, vide which only pending proceedings were/are saved to be 
adjudged under the Ordinance, 1959, whereas all the future disputes 
inter se the tenant and the landlord from the commencing day of the Act 
are to be determined as per the provisions of the Act, 2009, as according 
to section 12, if the landlord fails to or neglects to fulfill his obligation 
mentioned in the section, the tenant has the right to approach the Rent 
Tribunal for the redressal of his grievance and the Tribunal has the 
power to pass orders in terms of section 12(4). Likewise, if the tenant in 
terms of section 13 does not fulfill and abide by his obligations, the 
landlord can take recourse to his legal remedy by approaching the 
Tribunal. Above all, as mentioned earlier the landlord can seek the 
eviction of the tenant on the ground enumerated in section 15, and it is 
conspicuously noted that unlike section 13 of the Ordinance, 1959, the 
personal requirement, reconstruction etc. are not now one of the 
grounds, available to the landlord for seeking eviction of the tenant. 
From the above it is vivid and undoubtedly clear that on the enforcement 
of the Act, 2009 all the rights and remedies shall be available to the 
tenant or the landlord as the case may be, and it shall be ludicrous to 
conceive and interpret although he can avail the remedies and enforce 
such rights and duties, but shall not be obliged to pay the fine in terms of 
section 9 ibid because two years time is available to him. In my view 
sections 9 and 8, when both are read together along with the provisions 
of Act, 2009 and the object and spirit of the said enactment, leads to no 
other reasonable construction of the two sections (while in interaction), 
that the landlord/tenant can bring the existing tenancies in conformity 
with the Act within two years period and in this regard Section 8 should 
be construed independent and insulated from Section 9 and applied 
only in time with the sole object of bringing the tenancy in line with the 
provisions of the said Act. But where the applicant/petitioner 
(landlord/tenant) want to avail the remedy of that law (Act 2009), and 

7 
W.P.No.1215 of 2020 
 
 
exercise his right to enforce the duties of the opposite side, he shall be 
obliged to pay the fine as mentioned in section 9 ibid as in the case of 
future tenancies; notwithstanding it is an existing tenancy or otherwise. 
In this behalf no exemption or moratorium etc. on the basis of two years 
period mentioned in section 8 shall be available to him. And if the fine is 
not paid by the petitioner/ applicant the fall out and the consequences of 
failure of the non-compliance as envisaged by Section 9 for the future 
tenancy cases, as has been prescribed above, shall be duly attracted to 
such petition(s)/application(s) as well.” 
To the above effect, reference can also be made to MIRZA BOOK 
AGENCY through Managing Partner and others v. ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT JUDGE, LAHORE and others (2023 SCMR 1520).  
13.  
In the case of Kh. MUHAMMAD ISLAM v. SPECIAL JUDGE 
RENT and others (PLD 2016 Lahore 652), this Court while dealing with 
the similar proposition, held as under: - 
“5. 
If the provisions of Section-9 of the Act are read in 
conjunction with the provisions of Section 8 ibid it becomes abundantly 
clear that non-conformity of the existing tenancies with the provisions of 
the Act does not oust the jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal to adjudicate 
upon the matter rather it places a restriction upon the Rent Tribunal not 
to proceed with the matter unless the fine as mentioned in section 9 is 
paid. The case law referred by the learned counsel also deals with the 
true interpretation and effect of the law on the subject. In the said case 
the Hon'ble apex Court observed as under:- 
"From the above definitions and the survey of case law (supra) it 
is quite clear that the ministerial staff of the Rent Tribunal or for 
that matter the Tribunal itself shall not refuse to receive an 
application of the landlord/tenant, as the case may be, when 
brought before it rather on the first date when the matter comes 
before the Tribunal for the purposes of proceeding with it, the 
Tribunal shall ascertain from the applicant (of the case) if a 
validly executed and registered tenancy agreement (as per the 
provisions of the Act 2009) is there and its availability on the 
record. If that not being so, whether the applicant has deposited 
the amount of fine as envisaged by Section 9 ibid. If both these 
aspects are missing, the Rent Tribunal shall halt further 
proceedings in the matter (emphasis supplied). No notice shall be 
issued to the respondent of the case and the applicant shall first 
be required and directed first to deposit the fine by specifying the 
exact amount as assessed by the Tribunal on the basis of the 
assertion of the applicant with regard to the rate of rent, within a 
specified period of time to be mentioned in the order. If the 
amount is deposited by the applicant/petitioner of the case within 
such period or the time further extended by the Tribunal, the 
matter shall be proceeded with further, otherwise the application 
shall be dismissed. However, such dismissal shall not operate as 
a bar in the way of the applicant to initiate the case afresh after 
depositing the fine or having a tenancy agreement (executed and 
registered according to law). It may be emphatically held that no 

8 
W.P.No.1215 of 2020 
 
 
proceeding to determine the case on merit shall be conducted and 
continued by the Court, until and unless the fine is deposited by 
the applicant. This is mandate of the law and the provision ibid 
(Section 9) is mandatory, which has to be given effect in letter 
and spirit, keeping in view the purpose and the object of the Act 
2009. This, obviously is the interpretation and the effect of 
Section 9, when considered independent of Section 8 of the Act 
2009, and shall apply to the future tenancies (emphasis 
supplied)." 
6. 
In the light of above esteemed judgment and at the cost of 
repetition, it is observed that even if the tenancy is not in consonance 
with the provisions of the Act, even then the Rent Tribunal has exclusive 
jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the rent matter subject to fulfillment of 
requirement of Section-9 of the Act. It is not the case of the petitioner 
that the respondent has not deposited the fine as per requirement of the 
law, therefore, this petition having no substance is dismissed in limine. It 
is, however, observed that in case the requirements of Section 9 are not 
fulfilled, the learned Rent Tribunal shall halt further proceedings and 
firstly require the respondent to comply with the mandatory provisions 
of Section 9 within the specified period of time and then proceed with 
the matter in accordance with the law.” 
14.  
The above survey of law leads me to an irresistible conclusion 
that section 9 of the “Act, 2009” is not restricted only to the application 
filed by the landlord, more particularly the ejectment petition. In other 
words, any application either by the landlord or tenant, as the case may be, 
when brought before the Rent Tribunal under the “Act, 2009” for 
enforcement of his rights under the tenancy agreement not conforming to 
the provisions of the “Act, 2009”, can be proceeded after having a 
recourse to section 9 of the “Act, 2009” by directing the landlord or the 
tenant to deposit the penalty.  
15.  
The nutshell of above discussion is that the Rent Tribunal as 
well as the appellate Court though have formed a concurrent opinion but it 
is tainted with patent illegalities. Consequently, this petition is allowed. As 
a result thereof, impugned judgment dated 2nd March, 2020 passed by the 
learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi as well as order dated 30th 
October, 2019 passed by the learned Special Judge (Rent), Rawalpindi are 
set aside, being illegal and unlawful. As a sequel, the ejectment petition as 
well as application for leave to contest filed by the parties shall be deemed 
to be pending before the learned Special Judge (Rent), who shall decide the 
application for leave to contest while taking into consideration section 9 of 

9 
W.P.No.1215 of 2020 
 
 
the “Act, 2009” and then proceed with the matter strictly in accordance 
with law with all swiftness. No order as to costs.
