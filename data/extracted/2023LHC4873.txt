04.10.2023. M/s Ch. Ishtiaq Ahmad and Zarish Fatima advocate for the 
petitioner.  
Mr. Tariq Siddique, APG, with Nawaz Inspector and Tanveer. S.I. 
Through the instant Criminal Revision filed under Sections 
435/439-A of Cr.P.C. read with section 561-A of Cr.P.C., the 
petitioner has challenged the legality and validity of the order dated 
27.09.2023 passed by the learned Administrative Judge Anti-
Terrorism Courts, Lahore, whereby the request of the investigating 
officer, of case FIR No. 2598, dated 14.09.2023, registered under 
Section 427, 324, 186, 353, 148, 149 PPC, 7-ATA and Section 35 
LDA, for physical remand of the petitioner was accepted and 
physical remand of 14-days of the petitioner was allowed.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that a series of 
cases were registered against the petitioner and others on the same 
date and time, wherein the police sought remand after one another. 
Learned counsel further submitted that this is the 2nd physical 
remand of the petitioner after the expiry of the first physical remand 
of four days, which the lower court granted without mentioning any 
valid reason and progress.  
3. 
On 03.10.2023, this Court issued notice to the investigating 
officer of the instant case to appear alongwith record. Today, the 
investigating officer has appeared along with the record.  
4. 
In the instant case, the accused was arrested and produced 
before the learned Magistrate on 23.09.2023. On 23.09.2023, in 
response to the written request to hand over the accused for police 

Crl. Rev. No.64149 of 2023

remand for investigation, the learned Magistrate granted four (4) 
days of physical remand of the accused to the investigating officer. 
During the investigation conducted by the investigating officer, one 
Kalashnikov was recovered at the pointing of the petitioner on 
26.09.2023. Upon recovery of Kalashnikov, offence under section 
7-ATA was added on the order of Superintendent Police. After that, 
Inspector Muhammad Nawaz, the investigating officer, produced 
the petitioner before the learned Administrative Judge Anti-
Terrorism Courts, Lahore, and through the public prosecutor, sought 
physical remand of the petitioner for 30 days. Learned 
Administrative Judge Anti-Terrorism Courts, Lahore, allowed 
physical remand for 14 days vide impugned order dated 27.09.2023. 
By that time, the petitioner had already undergone the initial period 
of four (04) days of remand in the instant case when police custody 
was sought by the second investigating officer for further 
investigation from the Administrative Judge Anti-Terrorism Courts, 
under Section 21-E of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, in the instant 
case. The forwarding note of the public prosecutor reads as 
follows:- 
“This is second request of I.O for physical custody. In 
this case on 26-9-23 offence u/s 7-ATA has been added. 
I.O is advised to collect the evidence regarding 
application of 7-ATA. Klashankove has been recovered 
on the pointation of accused. The I.O requested for 
further physical custody for further investigation. 
Therefore, the request of I.O is forwarded to court.” 
 
The note forwarded by the Public Prosecutor reveals that the 
investigating officer requested a physical remand of the petitioner 
for further investigation. The investigating officer submitted a 
request to the learned Administrative Judge Anti-Terrorism Courts, 
Lahore, for grant of physical remand of the petitioner for thirty 
days, as provided under Section 21-E of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 
1997. The learned Administrative Judge Anti-Terrorism Courts, 

Crl. Rev. No.64149 of 2023

Lahore, considered the request of the investigating officer for 
remanding the accused petitioner to physical custody and remanded 
the accused petitioner to physical custody. As is mandated under 
Article 10 (2) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, under Section 67 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and 
Section 21-E of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 for getting 
authorization from the Court for detention, either in judicial custody 
or police custody. Section 21-E of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 is 
the law that regulates and empowers the learned Administrative 
Judge Anti-Terrorism Courts to authorize the detention of the 
accused either in police custody or in judicial custody, as the case 
may be. It is too well settled that while passing an order of remand, 
either judicial custody or police custody, as mandated in Section 21-
E of A.T.A. since the said detention deprives the personal liberty 
guaranteed under Article 10 (2) of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, such order of remand shall not be passed 
mechanically. The learned Administrative Judge must apply his 
mind to the entries in the police file, representation of the accused, 
and other facts and circumstances, and only on the satisfaction that 
such remand is justified then the learned Administrative Judge Anti-
Terrorism Courts will pass such order of remand. At this juncture, it 
is relevant to mention here that there cannot be any detention in 
police custody if more offences, either severe or otherwise, are 
added during the investigation and come to light at a later stage. If 
on record after the expiry of the initial period of four (04) days in 
physical custody in connection with the case investigation, the 
collection of evidence was completed, keeping in view the 
allegations leveled against the accused, then physical remand would 
be declined. If the investigation was not complete after the expiry of 
the initial remand, the Magistrate can act as provided under Sub 
Section (2) of Section 21-E of A.T.A. and remand him to such 
custody as mentioned therein during the second period. But the 

Crl. Rev. No.64149 of 2023

proviso of Sub-section (2) of Section 21-E of the Anti-Terrorism 
Act, 1997 gives discretion to the court that if further evidence may 
be available and no bodily harm has been or will be caused to the 
accused; the court can authorize the detention of the accused person 
in custody of police for a period to the court's satisfaction. Sub-
section (2) of Section 21-E of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, reads 
as under: 
 
“(2) No expansion of the time of the remand 
of the accused in police custody 1[or custody 
of any other investigating agency joined in 
the investigation] shall be allowed unless it 
can be shown by the investigating officer to 
the satisfaction of the Court that further 
evidence may be available and the Court is 
satisfied that no bodily harm has been or will 
be caused to the accused: Provided that the 
total period of such remand shall not exceed 
1[ninety] days.” 
The investigating officer is present in the court with the record of 
case FIR No.2598/2023 dated 14.09.2023 registered under sections 
324/427, 186/353, 148/149 PPC, 7-ATA, and 35 of the LDA Act. 
On perusal of the record with the able assistance of the Additional 
Prosecutor General, it reveals that after getting custody of the 
petitioner on physical remand vide order dated 27.09.2023, the 
investigating officer has not carried out the investigation till 
30.09.2023, and wrote one case dairy on 01.10.2023 with no 
progress. The police file is silent from 27.09.2023 to 30.09.2023, 
and from 02.10.2023 to date, the investigating officer has not 
conducted the investigation. The investigating officer present in 
Court on the Court’s query submitted that recovery has already been 
affected by the petitioner, and he is not required for further 
investigation. Even the learned Administrative Judge Anti-
Terrorism Courts, Lahore, also overlooked sub-section 2 of section 
21E of the Anti-Terrorism Act that while granting further remand of 
the accused in police custody, same cannot be granted, unless the 

Crl. Rev. No.64149 of 2023

investigating officer can show to the satisfaction of the court that 
further evidence may be available and the court is satisfied that no 
bodily harm has been or will be caused to the accused. On perusal 
of the remand order dated 27.09.2023, it reveals that no plausible 
reasons were given for granting the accused's physical remand to the 
investigating officer. The court has no reason for granting physical 
remand of the accused for 14 days.  
5. 
For the reasons above, the instant petition is accepted, and the 
impugned order dated 27.09.2023 passed by the learned 
Administrative Judge Anti-Terrorism Courts, Lahore, is set aside. 
The investigating officer present in Court is directed to produce the 
petitioner before the Trial Court today for lodging him into judicial 
lockup.  
6. 
These are the detailed reasons for acceptance of the instant 
petition.
