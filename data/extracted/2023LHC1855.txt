This Intra Court Appeal has been filed against the 
order dated 23.01.2023 passed by the learned Single 
Judge in Chambers in Writ Petition No.6385 of 2021, 
whereby the petition filed by the appellant under Article 
199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, was dismissed.  
2. 
The brief facts necessary for the disposal of the 
instant appeal are that the appellant was serving as 
Accountant in the Municipal Committee, Liaquatpur 
however, was proceeded under the Punjab Employees 
Efficiency, Discipline & Accountability Act, 2006 and on 
the basis of Inquiry Report compiled by the Chief Officer, 
Municipal Committee, Liaquatpur/respondent No.3, was 
terminated from service vide order dated 07.03.2018, 
representation against which was also dismissed by 
respondent No.3 vide orders dated 01.10.2018 and 
16.11.2020. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant filed an 
appeal before the Deputy Commissioner, Rahim Yar Khan 
(respondent No.1), which appeal, vide order dated 
21.05.2021, was partially accepted and penalty of 
termination from service was converted into “compulsory 
retirement from service”. The Municipal Committee, 
Liaquatpur filed another petition before the Deputy 

Intra Court Appeal No. 19 0f 2023 
 
2 
 
Commissioner, Rahim Yar Khan (respondent No.1) for 
review of the aforesaid order dated 21.05.2021, which 
petition by the Municipal Committee, Liaquatpur was 
accepted by the Deputy Commissioner, Rahim Yar Khan 
(respondent No.1) vide order dated 07.07.2021. The 
validity and authenticity of the order dated 07.07.2021, 
passed by the Deputy Commissioner, Rahim Yar Khan 
(respondent No.1) was assailed through the Writ Petition 
No.6385 of 2021, which petition was dismissed, hence this 
appeal. 
3. 
At the very outset, a question was put to the learned 
counsel for the appellant about how the instant Intra Court 
Appeal was competent in view of the proviso to subsection 
(2) of section 3 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972. The 
learned counsel for the appellant in response to our query 
regarding the maintainability of the instant Intra Court 
Appeal, submitted that the appellant had challenged the 
order 
dated 
07.07.2021 
passed 
by 
the 
Deputy 
Commissioner, Rahim Yar Khan/respondent No.1 through 
the Writ Petition No.6385 of 2021 against which order no 
appeal was provided, therefore, the instant Intra Court 
Appeal was maintainable. The learned counsel for the 
appellant also submitted that the learned Single Judge in 
Chambers had erred in facts and law while passing the 
order dated 23.01.2023. The learned counsel for the 
appellant also submitted that the Deputy Commissioner, 
Rahim Yar Khan (respondent No.1), had no authority to 
pass the order dated 07.07.2021. 
4.    We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant 
and perused the record.  
5.    In order to address the afore-referred proposition of 
law that how the instant Intra Court Appeal was competent 
in view of  the proviso to subsection (2) of section 3 of the 
Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972, for the facility of 

Intra Court Appeal No. 19 0f 2023 
 
3 
 
reference, it would be appropriate to reproduce section 3 
of Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972:-- 
"3. Appeal to High Courts in certain cases: 
1. An appeal shall lie to a Bench of two or more Judges of a 
High Court from a decree passed or final order made by a 
single Judge of that Court in the exercise of its original civil 
jurisdiction. 
2. An appeal shall also lie to a Bench of two or more Judges 
of a High Court from an order made by a Single Judge of 
that Court under [clause (1) of Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan] not being 
an Order made under sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (b) of 
that clause: 
Provided that the appeal referred to in this subsection shall 
not be available or competent if the application brought 
before the High Court under Article 199 arises out of any 
proceedings in which the law applicable provided for at 
least one appeal or one revision or one review to any Court, 
Tribunal or authority against the original order. 
3. No appeal shall lie under subsection (1) or subsection (2) 
from an interlocutory order or an order which does not 
dispose of the entire case before the Court." 
 
The plain reading of the above proviso shows that appeal 
shall not be available or competent under section 3 of 
the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 before a Division 
Bench, of this Court if the petition brought before High 
Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 arises out of any proceedings 
in which the law applicable provided for at least one 
appeal, one revision or one review to any Court, 
Tribunal or authority against the original order. This 
means that the relevant order may not necessarily be the 
one which is impugned in the writ petition but the test is 
that whether the original order passed in the proceedings 

Intra Court Appeal No. 19 0f 2023 
 
4 
 
is subject to appeal, revision or review under the relevant 
law. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has declared 
in the case of “Mst. Karim Bibi and others v. Hussain 
Bakhsh and another” (PLD 1984 SC 344) as under:- 
" 8. After giving our anxious consideration to the arguments 
urged in support of this appeal we are, however, not impressed 
by any of the contentions raised. The test laid down by the 
Legislature in the proviso is that if the law applicable to the 
proceedings from which the Constitutional Petition arises 
provides for at least one appeal , against the original order, , then 
no appeal would be competent from the order of a Single Judge 
in the constitutional jurisdiction to a Bench of two or more 
judges of the High Court. The crucial words are the "original 
order". It is. clear from the wording of the proviso that the 
requirement of the availability of an appeal in the law applicable 
is not in relation to the impugned order in the Constitutional 
Petition, which may be the order passed by the lowest officer or 
authority in the hierarchy or an order passed by higher 
authorities in appeal, revision or review, if any, provided in the 
relevant statute. Therefore, the relevant order may not 
necessarily be the one which is under challenge but the test is 
whether the original order passed in the proceedings subject to 
an appeal under the relevant law, irrespective. of the fact 
whether the remedy of appeal so provided was availed of or not. 
Apparently the meaning of the expression "original order" is the 
order with which the proceedings under the relevant statute 
commenced. The word "proceedings" has been used in different 
enactments and has been subject to judicial interpretation in a 
number of cases wherein it has received either restricted or wide 
meaning according to the text and subject-matter of the 
particular statute. 1 do not consider it necessary to notice the 
various judgments in which this word was so construed. Suffice 
it to refer to the case of Nawab Din v. Member Board of Revenue 
P E D (sic) 1979 S C 846, in which this Court had occasion to 
examine the scope and meaning of the word as it occurs in 
section 2 (2) of the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons 
Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975. A useful discussion will be found in 
this case with reference to precedents as the meaning of the term 
"proceedings". An earlier case of Jan Muhammad and another v. 
Home Secretary, West Pakistan and others P L D 1968 Lah. 
1455, was referred to in this connection and the view taken 
therein was declared by this Court as the correct enunciation of 
the law on the subject. In the latter case reference was made to 
the definition of the term "proceedings" in the book "Words and 
phrases" which may usefully be reproduced as under ; 
"The term `proceedings' is a very comprehensive term, and, 
generally speaking, moans a prescribed course of action for 
enforcing a legal right, and hence it necessarily embraces the 
requisite steps by which judicial action is invoked. A 

Intra Court Appeal No. 19 0f 2023 
 
5 
 
`proceeding' would include every step taken towards the 
further progress of a cause in Court or before a Tribunal, 
where it may be pending. It is the step towards the objective 
, to be achieved, say for instance the judgment in a pending 
suit. The proceeding, commences with the first step by 
which the machinery of the law is put into motion in order 
to take cognizance of the case. It is indeed a comprehensive 
expression and includes all possible -steps in the action 
under the law, from its commencement to the execution of 
the judgment." 
 
The august Supreme Court in the case of  “Muhammad 
Aslam Sukhera and others v. Collector Land 
Acquisition, Lahore Improvement Trust, Lahore and 
another” (PLD 2005 SC 45), while interpreting the 
word "original order" under proviso to subsection (2) of 
section 3 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 held that 
the expression "original order" in section 3(2) of the 
Ordinance, is used in generic sense in contradistinction 
to orders passed in appeal, revision or review. The word 
"original" is susceptible to different meanings in the 
context of a particular statute. It does not always mean 
"first in order". The expression "original order" in section 
3(2) of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 was used in 
generic sense in contradistinction to orders passed in 
appeal, revision or review. In “Macmillan and Company 
Limited v. K. and J. Cooper” (AIR 1924 Privy Council 
75), a case from Bombay jurisdiction, the Privy Council 
had the occasion to interpret the word "original" in the 
context of Copyright Act, 1911, as follows: -- 
            "The word "original" does not mean that the work 
must be the expression of original or invented thought. 
Copyright Acts are not concerned with the opinion of ideas, 
but with the expression of thoughts; and in the case of 
"literary work" with the expression of thought in print or 
writing. The originality which is required relates to the 

Intra Court Appeal No. 19 0f 2023 
 
6 
 
expression of the thought; but the Act does not require that 
the expression must be in an original or novel form, but that 
the work must not be copied from another work-that it 
should originate from the author." 
  
            "The mere process of selecting passages from works 
readily accessible to the public is not, but difficulty in 
obtaining assess to the originals are skill manifested in 
making or arranging the selection is sufficient to give the 
character of an "original literary work" to the selection." 
  
 In “Re Oriental Bank” (54 L.J. Ch. 481) it was held on 
the construction of a clause in the Charter of that Bank that 
the words "original-holder" of shares did not mean the first 
allottee, but meant the immediate transferor to the person 
holding the shares at the time when the phrase became 
operative i.e. in that case, the winding-up of the company." 
In 
“Deputy 
Commissioner/Administrator, 
District 
Council, Attock and another v. Lawrencepur Woollen 
Textile Mills Ltd.” (1999 SCMR 1357), the legality and 
propriety of a Notification issued by the District Council 
whereby export tax was levied was brought under 
challenge. It was held by the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
that the Notification issued was in substance an "order" for 
levy of export tax and was, therefore, appealable to the 
controlling authority under the law. The Supreme Court 
went on to hold that:-- 
  
"2. The respondent-Company is manufacturer of woolen cloth 
and blankets. By notification, dated 6-12-1976 the export tax 
was levied by the appellants on woolen cloth and blankets. The 
respondent-Company filed Writ Petition No.4043 of 1977 in the 
Lahore High Court, Lahore wherein the legality and propriety of 
the said notification had been challenged inter alia on the ground 
that the relevant Rules were not adhered to before levy of the 
tax." 
  
In 
“Vice-Chancellor/Chairman 
Admission 
Board 
University of Health Science, Lahore v. Breeha Zainab 

Intra Court Appeal No. 19 0f 2023 
 
7 
 
and another” (2011 MLD 1652), the challenge was to the 
order of refusal of admission to the University of Health 
Sciences, Lahore. It was held that since a remedy of 
revision was available against the order of refusal of 
admission, which was to be treated as original order for 
the purpose of section 3(2) of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 
1972, the Intra Court Appeal was not competent. Further, 
it is of utmost importance to clarify that availing of such 
remedy of appeal, revision or review is not a sine qua 
non to question the maintainability of Intra Court Appeal 
and it is sufficient if the applicable law in the matter 
provides such remedy. It is irrelevant whether such 
remedy is availed by the aggrieved person or not. There 
may be cases where despite the availability of an appeal, 
revision or review against the original order, such 
remedy was not actually availed by the aggrieved party. 
Guidance is sought from the case of “Syed Arif Raza 
Rizvi v. Messrs Pakistan  International Airlines through 
Chairman/M.D., Karachi (PLD 2001 SC 182), wherein 
the august Supreme Court has expounded this concept in 
the  following words: 
       "…The proviso to section 3(2) of the Law Reforms Ordinance 
(XII of 1972) as amended bars the Intra-Court appeal to a 
Bench of two or more Judges of the High Court in case the 
law applicable to the proceedings provided for at least one 
appeal, revision or review against the original order. In other 
words the bar under the proviso is applicable, if the law 
applicable to the proceedings provided for a forum for appeal, 
revision or review against the original order. This bar under 
the proviso is attracted in case such a forum is provided under 
the law applicable, even though the aggrieved party did not 
actually avail of the remedy provided by means of the appeal, 
revision or review. This is the only rational and harmonious 

Intra Court Appeal No. 19 0f 2023 
 
8 
 
interpretation that can be put on this proviso in consonance 
with the intention of the Legislature…" 
In the instant case, the appellant  was proceeded under 
the Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline & 
Accountability Act, 2006 and on the basis of Inquiry 
Report compiled by the Chief Officer, Municipal 
Committee, Liaquatpur (respondent No.3), the appellant 
was terminated from service vide order dated 
07.03.2018, the representation against which order, as 
filed by the appellant, was also dismissed by the Chief 
Officer, Municipal Committee, Liaquatpur (respondent 
No.3) vide orders dated 01.10.2018 and 16.11.2020. 
Feeling aggrieved, the appellant filed an appeal before 
the Deputy Commissioner, Rahim Yar Khan (respondent 
No.1), which appeal, vide order dated 21.05.2021, was 
partially accepted and penalty of termination from 
service was converted into “compulsory retirement from 
service”. The Municipal Committee, Liaquatpur filed 
another petition before the Deputy Commissioner, 
Rahim Yar Khan (respondent No.1) for the revising of 
the aforesaid order dated 21.05.2021, which petition by 
the Municipal Committee, Liaquatpur was accepted vide 
order dated 07.07.2021 passed by the Deputy 
Commissioner, Rahim Yar Khan (respondent No.1). The 
Deputy  Commissioner Rahim Yar Khan (respondent 
No.1) had the authority under the law to pass the order 
dated 07.07.2021. Furthermore , section 16 of the Punjab 
Employees Efficiency, Discipline & Accountability Act, 

Intra Court Appeal No. 19 0f 2023 
 
9 
 
2006 provides for an appeal against the imposition of 
any penalty under the said Act whereas section 17 of the 
Punjab 
Employees 
Efficiency, 
Discipline 
& 
Accountability Act, 2006 provides the power of 
revision. Section 16 and 17 of the Punjab Employees 
Efficiency, Discipline & Accountability Act, 2006 read 
as under :- 
“16. Departmental appeal and review.– (1) An accused who 
has been awarded any penalty under this Act may, except 
where the penalty has been imposed by the Chief Minister, 
within thirty days from the date of communication of the 
order, prefer departmental appeal directly to the appellate 
authority: 
      Provided that where the order has been passed by the 
Chief Minister, the accused may, within the aforesaid period, 
submit a review petition directly to the Chief Minister. 
      (2)  The authority empowered under sub-section (1) shall 
call for the record of the case and comments on the points 
raised in the appeal from the concerned department or office, 
and on consideration of the appeal or the review petition, as 
the case may be, by an order in writing– 
            (a)  uphold the order of penalty and reject the appeal 
or review petition; or 
            (b)  set aside the orders and exonerate the accused; or 
            (c)  modify the orders and reduce or enhance the 
penalty; or 
            (d) set aside the order of penalty and remand the case 
to the competent authority, where it is satisfied that the 
proceedings by the competent authority or the inquiry officer 
or inquiry committee, as the case may be, have not been 
conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Act, or 
the facts and merits of the case have been ignored, with the 
directions to either hold a de novo inquiry or to rectify the 
procedural lapses or irregularities in the proceedings: 
  Provided that where the appellate or review authority 
proposes to enhance the penalty, it shall by an order in 
writing– 
(i)   inform the accused of the action proposed to be taken 
against him and the grounds of such action; and 
(ii)   give him a reasonable opportunity to show cause against 
the action and afford him an opportunity of personal hearing 
either itself or through a hearing officer; provided that the 
hearing officer shall only be appointed where the appellate or 
the review authority is of the rank of Secretary to the 
Government of the Punjab or above. 

Intra Court Appeal No. 19 0f 2023 
 
10 
 
      (3)  An appeal or review preferred under this section shall 
be made in the form of a petition, in writing, and shall set forth 
concisely the grounds of objection to the impugned order in a 
proper and temperate language. 
17. Revision.– (1) The Chief Minister, Chief Secretary or the 
Administrative Secretary or any other appellate authority may 
call for the record of any proceedings within one year of the 
order of exoneration or imposition of a penalty, passed by the 
competent authority or the order of appellate authority, as the 
case may be, for the purpose of satisfying himself as to the 
correctness, legality or propriety of such proceedings or order. 
      (2)  On examining the record of the case, such authority 
may– 
               (i)   uphold the orders of the competent authority or 
the appellate authority, as the case may be; or 
              (ii)   order the competent authority to hold de novo 
inquiry; or 
             (iii)   impose or enhance a penalty or penalties: 
  Provided that no order, prejudicial to the accused, shall be 
passed under this section unless the accused has been given a 
reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the proposed 
action and an opportunity of personal hearing.” 
6.     This discussion leads us to the indisputable 
conclusion that when the remedies of appeal and 
revision were available against the order of imposition 
of penalty upon the appellant by the “competent 
authority”, which was to be treated as the  original 
order for the purpose of section 3(2) of the Law 
Reforms Ordinance, 1972, then the Intra Court Appeal 
was not competent and this appeal, being devoid of 
merit, is therefore dismissed in limine.
