Society (the “Petitioner”) is aggrieved of order dated 13.11.2023 
passed by the Respondent No.1/Secretary to the Government of 
Punjab, Cooperative Department, Lahore, whereby appeal filed by the 
“Petitioner” under Section 64 of The Cooperative Societies Act, 1925 
(the “Act”) was dismissed maintaining the order dated 27.04.2023 
passed by Respondent No.2/Circle Registrar, Cooperative Society, 
Rawalpindi.  
2. 
Briefly stated facts of the case are that petition filed under 
Section 54 of the “Act” by the Respondent No.3, qua non-transfer of 
Plot No.G-18 (the “subject plot”), was allowed vide order dated 
27.04.2023 by the Respondent No.2 directing the “Petitioner” to 
transfer the “subject plot” in his favour. Being dissatisfied from the 
above said order, the “Petitioner” filed appeal before the Respondent 
No.1 which was dismissed vide impugned order dated 03.11.2023, 
hence this petition.  

W.P.No.74 of 2024 
 
       2 
3. 
Learned counsel for the “Petitioner” inter alia contends that 
the forums below have failed to consider the crucial aspect of the 
matter that the Respondent No.3 is a defaulter of the “Petitioner” and 
he failed to comply with its rules, regulations and by-laws; that 
pursuant to aforesaid, his membership has already been cancelled and 
matter in this regard is subjudice before the Registrar Cooperative, 
Lahore and till its final decision, further allotment/transfer cannot be 
made; that while passing the impugned orders, the forums below have 
not taken into consideration that the Respondent No.3 violated the 
terms of agreement dated 10.07.2020; that the “Petitioner” is 
authorized to refuse the transfer of the “subject plot” in favour of the 
Respondent No.3 under Section 17 of the “Act”, but the said 
provision of law has been ignored.  
4. 
Conversely, learned law officer filed report and parawise 
comments controverting the stance of the “Petitioner” by supporting 
the impugned orders with the submissions that impugned orders have 
been passed by the lower forums pursuant to proper appreciation of 
the facts and having jurisdiction to decide the lis. 
5. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6. 
It is the case of the “Petitioner” that the Respondent No.3 is a 
defaulter and he has violated the agreement executed between the 
“Petitioner” and the Respondent No.3. While the stance of the 
Respondents No.1 and 2 is that mere pendency of cancellation of 
membership before the competent forum is not a bar for transfer of 
the “subject plot” in favour of the Respondent No.3. As such, the case 
in hand revolves around the issue as to whether the “Petitioner” can 
refuse transfer of the “subject plot” in favour of the Respondent No.3 
on the touchstone of Section 17 of the “Act” or not?  
7. 
It shall not be out of context to mention here that the term 
‘member’ stands defined under Section 3(c) of the “Act” as that “a 
person joining in the application for registration of a society or a 
person admitted to membership after registration in accordance with 
the rules and by-laws applicable to such society”. Though said 

W.P.No.74 of 2024 
 
       3 
definition does not envisage a "member" to be an absolute or an  
un-qualified member with full rights and privileges, yet it makes the 
said membership not only subject to the rules but also subject to bye-
laws of the concerned society. Section 7-A of the “Act” prescribes the 
eligibility for member, while rights and liabilities of the members are 
defined under Chapter III, Section 17 of the “Act” which reads as 
under: 
“17. No rights of membership to be exercised till due 
payment are made.---No person shall exercise the 
rights of a member of a society unless or until he has 
made such payment to the society in respect of 
membership, or acquired such interest in the society as 
may be prescribed by the rules or the by-laws of such 
society” 
 
 
Above provision of law restricts exercise of rights of a member 
by a person in connection with the membership or acquired interest in 
the society as prescribed by the rules or by-laws of such society until 
or unless he made payment to the society. In the instant petition, it is 
an admitted position that the Respondent No.3 is the member of the 
“Petitioner” against whom the matter with regard to cancellation of 
his membership is pending before the Registrar Cooperative, Lahore 
as is evident from ground (b) of the petition. Pertinently, Section 17-B 
of the “Act” deals with expulsion of a member which reads as under: 
[17-B. 
Expulsion of a member….(1) A 
Society may recommend to the Registrar to expel 
from its membership a member who is a persistent 
defaulter of the dues of the society or who commits 
any act prejudicial to the interests of the Society. 
 
Provided that the managing committee of the 
society shall after affording the member an 
opportunity of hearing, place the matter before the 
general body of the society and approval there shall 
be communicated to the Registrar. 
(2) 
The Registrar may expel such a member from 
the society after affording him an opportunity of 
hearing.   
 
8.. 
A minute reading of the Section 17-B ibid guides that the 
Registrar may expel a member from the society who is a persistent 

W.P.No.74 of 2024 
 
       4 
defaulter of the dues or commits any act prejudicial to the interest of 
the society subject to providing an opportunity of hearing. Whilst 
interpreting Section 17-B ibid, it has been held in case “FEROZE 
SHAMSI and 2 others versus PROVINCE OF SINDH, MINISTRY 
OF COOPERATION, THROUGH SECRETARY COOPERATION 
and 2 others” (2008 YLR 2763) that: 
“Keeping in view the wordings of section 17-B, 
there is nothing about Associate Members etc. as 
contended by the learned counsel appearing for 
the societies and notwithstanding the fact that all 
modes of transfer including sale, inheritance, gift 
or otherwise have been mentioned in that section 
but the transferee has been termed as a member 
only in the first proviso of that section with no 
order definition. … Section 17-B of the Act is the 
only section which is legalizing the transfer from 
a member to another person without any 
restrictions and immediately after the transfer, 
the 
transferee 
becomes 
entitled 
to 
the 
membership of the Society as under the said very 
section the transferor ceased to be a member 
after the transfer of his interest in the immovable 
property, therefore, his share in the Society, 
which are also an interest of the transferor and 
are attached to the plot and/or prerequisite for 
acquiring the plot is naturally to be transferred 
to the member acquiring the property through 
transfer from a past members.” 
 
9. 
The observation that “since a member of Society seized to be a 
member after transfer of his right/title in respect to plot etc. in a 
society, therefore, the person acquiring the same interest is entitled to 
membership of the society and its denial is illegal” has been reiterated 
in case “Haji Asghar Ali and others Vs. Muhammad Nawaz Nerejo 
and others” (2010 YLR 783).  
10. 
The ground as taken by the “Petitioner” for declaring the 
Respondent No.3 as defaulter on the basis of agreement dated 
10.07.2020 is not correct as this agreement relates to some other plots 
No.F-56 and F-57, whereas the “subject plot” was admittedly 
purchased by the Respondent No.3 from Hazrat Jan after payment of 
full consideration and taking possession thereof and same is not under 

W.P.No.74 of 2024 
 
       5 
any litigation as is evident from the impugned orders. No default 
against the “subject plot” is agitated by the “Petitioner” and the fact 
has not been denied that the Respondent No.3 has purchased the 
“subject plot” from a member of society and has taken over its 
possession at spot. At this juncture, needless to add that the 
“Petitioner” cannot refuse to transfer the “subject plot” in favour of 
the Respondent No.3 as the provision of Section 17 of the “Act” are 
not attracted to the case in hand as well as keeping in consideration 
that Article 23 of the “Constitution” guarantees that “Every citizen 
shall have the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property in any 
part of Pakistan, subject to the Constitution and any reasonable 
restrictions imposed by law in the public interest.” Further, Article 24 
of the “Constitution” guaranteed protection of property rights. 
However, the “Petitioner” may pursue cancellation of membership of 
the Respondent No.3 as alleged, if pending.  
11. 
Both the impugned orders are well-reasoned and well-argued 
having been passed after taking into consideration every aspect of the 
case.  
12. 
In view of above, this petition holds no merit hence the same is 
hereby dismissed.
