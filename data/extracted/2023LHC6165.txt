Imtiaz Hussain 
Versus      District Judge etc.  
 
J U D G M E N T 
Date of Hearing: 
13.11.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Muhammad Adnan Chaudhry, 
Advocate.  
Ms. Zubaida Faryal, Advocate 
alongwith the petitioner and the minor 
Nalaain Abbas.  
Respondent No.3 by:  
 
Mr. Muhammad Ihsan Gondal, 
Advocate alongwith the respondent and 
the minor, Tooba Zahra.  
 
Anwaar Hussain, J.  
The petitioner, who is real father of 
Tooba Zahra (“the minor daughter”), has called in question the 
legality and propriety of order dated 06.12.2017 passed by the Family 
Court, Bhakkar as also the judgment dated 26.09.2018 passed by the 
District Judge, Bhakkar. Through the former order, the guardian 
petition filed by the petitioner against respondent No.3 (“the 
respondent”) seeking custody of the minor daughter, was dismissed 
whereas through the latter judgment, the appeal preferred against the 
order of the Family Court met with the same fate. Admittedly, no 
visitation schedule was chalked out by the Courts below. 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that findings of both 
the Courts below are against the law and facts of the case, inter alia, 
for the reason that the minor daughter is residing with the respondent 
who is her real mother, however, the respondent has contracted second 
marriage with a stranger, therefore, she has no right under the law to 
retain the custody of the minor daughter. Places reliance on cases 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 244677/2018

reported as Mst. Bakhat Bibi v. Bahadur Ali and others  (2015 CLC 
1260 Lahore) and Naghma Rani v. Additional District Judge, Gujrat 
and 3 others (2018 CLC 767 Lahore) in support of his contentions. 
Adds that the petitioner has not contracted second marriage and is also 
raising the minor son, namely, Nalaain Abbas, born from the marriage 
of the petitioner with the respondent. Further contends that at the time 
of dissolution of marriage, both the parties agreed that the minor son 
will remain with the father and the minor daughter will remain with 
the mother till she contracts second marriage and since the respondent 
has re-married, therefore, she is obligated to handover the custody of 
the minor daughter to the petitioner. Admittedly, another minor son of 
the parties who remained with the respondent has passed away during 
pendency of the proceedings.  
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent has supported 
the impugned decisions of the Courts below. Contends that the 
petitioner has initiated the guardian proceedings just to avoid the 
payment of maintenance allowance to the minor daughter, in respect 
of which decree passed by the Family Court is holding the field. Adds 
that the petitioner has not paid a single penny to the minor daughter, 
towards her maintenance allowance, which shows irresponsible 
attitude of the petitioner qua welfare of the said minor. Places reliance 
on cases reported as Shagufta Bano v. Musarrat Hanif etc. (1982 CLC 
1821 Lahore), Mst. Hameed Mai v. Irshad Hussain  (PLD 2002 SC 
267) and Mst. Beena v. Raja Muhammad and others (PLD 2020 SC 
508) in support of his contentions.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner has vehemently built up his 
entire case on the basis of the agreement which is alleged to have been 
violated on account of second marriage by the respondent. Argument 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 244677/2018 
 
3 
 
 
is misconceived inasmuch as the children cannot be treated as 
commodities and their welfare cannot be compromised by their 
parents by executing any agreement. Suffice to observe that such 
agreements are against public policy and hence, not enforceable under 
the law. This Court is of the view that placing a Sword of Damocles of 
losing the custody of the child upon remarriage on the respondent is 
not only illegal but also raises a logical question as why such a 
condition was not placed on the petitioner himself, disentitling him 
from keeping the custody of the minor son and seeking the custody of 
the minor daughter. In this regard, suffice to observe that it is well-
settled principle of law that re-marriage of the mother is not a stand-
alone ground for depriving her from keeping custody of her minor 
children. Case reported as Raja Muhammad Owais v. Nazia Jabeen 
and others (2022 SCMR 2123) is referred. In view of the judgment of 
Supreme Court in case of Raja Muhammad Owais supra, reliance 
placed upon the cases cited at bar by learned counsel for the petitioner 
is of no help to the petitioner, as also being distinguishable on account 
of facts. 
6. 
Having observed so, it is imperative to mention that in order to 
gather the psychological and mental state of the minors on account of 
their separation from their parents as well as inter se separation, being 
the siblings, I have interviewed the minors in presence of their 
parents, in my Chambers, after hearing arguments of their respective 
counsel, in the open Court. The minor daughter whose custody is the 
bone of contention between the parties, at present, appears to be well-
groomed and brought up by the respondent. Admittedly, the 
respondent has contracted second marriage and has a daughter from 
the second wedlock. The said daughter of the respondent was also 
present today who appears to have a conducive bonding with the 
minor daughter. As opposed to the minor son, the minor daughter of 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 244677/2018

the parties was more interactive and expressive while showing her 
playful interaction with her step sister. The respondent has also 
produced academic record of the minor daughter, in original, which 
has been examined in presence of the petitioner and returned while 
retaining copies thereof. The said record as also the bonding of the 
minor daughter with her step sister indicates that the minor daughter is 
living and being raised by the respondent in a conducive environment 
and second marriage of the respondent had no adverse effects on the 
minor daughter.  
7. 
There is yet another angle from which this case can be 
examined inasmuch as during the course of arguments as also during 
Chambers’ hearing of the parties and the minors, the petitioner did his 
best to conceal factum of his own second marriage by imparting 
incorrect instructions to his learned counsel, in open Court, as also by 
tutoring the minor son to lie about the petitioner’s re-marriage and 
having a child from his second wedlock. Efforts to conceal his own 
second marriage in itself adversely reflects upon the conduct of the 
petitioner, which disentitles him from the custody of the minor 
daughter. Once the petitioner realized that he cannot hide the truth 
from the Court any more, the petitioner tendered apology and stated 
that due to the fear that he will be denied custody of the minor 
daughter, he lied before the Court(s). His conduct is unbecoming of a 
responsible parent as he tutored the minor son to lie, which act is 
deprecated and cannot be countenanced.  
8. 
Moreover, it appears that the personal ego of the petitioner as 
also to avoid his obligation to maintain the minor daughter has pushed 
the petitioner to approach the Court by filing guardian petition 
inasmuch as there is no evidence available on record that he has ever 
paid any maintenance allowance to the minor daughter, pursuant to 
the decree of the Court passed on account of maintenance allowance. 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 244677/2018

Hence, the petitioner is not entitled to any relief qua custody of the 
minor daughter on this ground as well.  
9. 
Perusal of record reveals that there is no visitation schedule 
chalked out by the Courts below to cater the need of developing a 
strong parental bonding of the minor daughter with her non-custodial 
parent, i.e., the petitioner and vice versa for the respondent to meet the 
minor son. Moreover, while exercising parens patriae jurisdiction, 
this Court is perturbed that the parties have treated their children as 
commodities/chattels while the custodial and non-custodial parents 
locked their horns to get the custody of the minor daughter before the 
Courts even at the cost of well-being and welfare of the minor 
daughter, the agreement executed by the petitioner and the respondent 
clearly evinces that they separated the minor siblings from each other 
as if it were only the mother and father respectively who had some 
rights of custody and/or control over their minor children and the 
minors have no rights to enjoy each other’s company. In the instant 
case, the minor siblings, inter se, have been separated in the most 
inhumane manner. This Court feels that the right of minor siblings to 
develop bond of love and ownness among themselves by remaining 
united and grow up in the companionship has been ignored. While 
parents may submerge and get themselves subsumed in their lives 
respectively, it is the minor siblings who have suffered the most by 
lack of mutual interaction, in the most innocent manner, during the 
most innocent period of their lives, the playful memories whereof 
would have been indelibly etched into their past memories to be 
relished in future. This Court is of the opinion that the siblings are 
required to be united and brought up together by one parent giving 
him custody to avoid causing additional trauma of facing separation 
from a sibling, which is not possible in the instant case inasmuch as 
the respondent has not made any effort to get the custody of the minor

son. While both the parents separated the minor siblings as if the same 
were commodities and chattels, they never bothered about the toll it 
could have taken on the minor siblings on account of their inter se 
separation. At this juncture, this Court considers it obligatory to 
observe that the learned Judge of the Family Court, while deciding the 
guardian petition, must in addition to and/or apart from other factors, 
also evaluate the adverse effects of separating the siblings from each 
other.  
10. 
Even though the respondent has neither made any effort to 
obtain custody of the minor son residing with the petitioner nor there 
is any visitation schedule for the minor siblings to meet each other, 
this Court cannot remain oblivious to the rights of the minor siblings 
to meet each other and/or remain united. Strong inter se bonding of 
the siblings and love is as important to the wellbeing and welfare of 
the minors as parental bonding of a non-custodial parent with his/her 
minor children. Therefore, any visitation schedule must gear towards 
the welfare of the minor siblings separated by their parents and this 
Court in exercise of its parental jurisdiction feels obligated to ensure 
that visitation schedule is chalked out for the meeting of the minor 
siblings with each other. This Court in reported judgment rendered in 
Writ Petition No.17366/2021 titled “Shahid Wazeer v. Additional 
District Judge, etc.” (2022 LHC 7798) has already observed that only 
such visitation schedule can be considered conducive to the welfare of 
a minor, which includes an overnight stay of a minor with non-
custodial parent. Therefore, the findings of the Appellate Court below 
are upheld to the extent of dismissal of appeal of the petitioner, 
however, following visitation schedule is chalked out:  
 
i. 
The minor daughter shall be handed over to the 
petitioner twice in a month on first and third 
Saturday of every month who shall pick the minor 
daughter at 5.00 p.m. from the house of the 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 244677/2018 
 
7 
 
 
respondent and drop her back at the same time on 
the next day, i.e. Sunday at the same time.  
ii. 
On 2nd day of each Eid i.e., Eid ul Fitar and Eid ul 
Azha at 10:00 a.m., the petitioner shall pick the 
minor daughter from the house of the respondent 
and will be responsible for her safe dropping at the 
house of respondent on the next day at 4:00 p.m.  
iii. 
In winter holidays, the minor daughter will spend 
first four holidays with the petitioner. The minor 
daughter shall be handed over on first day of winter 
vacations at 10:00 a.m. to the petitioner and he shall 
return her to the respondent in evening at 5:00 p.m. 
on the fourth day. The petitioner will be responsible 
for safe pick and drop of the minor daughter. 
iv. 
In summer vacations, the minor daughter shall 
spend first month of summer vacations with the 
petitioner. The petitioner shall pick the minor 
daughter  at 10:00 a.m. on the second day of 
summer vacations and drop her on 30th day to the 
respondent's house at 11:00 a.m. 
v. 
On birthday of the minor daughter, she shall be 
handed over to the petitioner at 2:00 pm and he 
shall return the minor daughter to the respondent at 
6:00 pm on the same day. 
11. 
The petitioner is directed to submit third party local surety bond 
in the sum of Rs.500,000/- to the satisfaction of the Family Court 
concerned, prior to receiving the minor daughter from the respondent 
for the first overnight stay.

8 
 
 
12. 
 Before parting with, it would be appropriate to observe about 
the schedule of meeting of the respondent with the minor son who is 
in custody of the petitioner. The record depicts, as also admitted by 
the respondent herself, that she neither sought custody of the minor 
son nor made any effort to have a visitation schedule by approaching 
any forum including the Courts below, therefore, this Court restrains 
itself from chalking out any detailed visitation schedule in this regard. 
However, if so desired and advised, the respondent may approach the 
Family Court concerned, by filing an appropriate application seeking 
custody of the minor son and/or a visitation schedule enabling her to 
meet with the minor son. If done so, the Family Court concerned shall 
proceed with the matter, in accordance with law.  
13. 
This writ petition is disposed of in above terms.
