Ch. Muhammad Iqbal, J:-  Through this single 
judgment I intend to decide the titled Civil Revision 
[No.60420/2021] as well as Civil Revision No.58628/2021 as 
both these cases have arisen out of the same judgments & 
decrees. 
2.  
Through these civil revisions the petitioners have 
challenged the validity of the judgment & decree dated 
26.03.2019 passed by the learned Civil Judge, Khushab who 
decreed the suit for declaration filed by the respondents No.1 to 6 
and also assailed the judgment & decree dated 25.06.2021 passed 
by the learned Additional District Judge, Khushab who dismissed 
the appeal of the petitioners.

Khan was the original owner of the suit land measuring 277 
Kanal 19 Marla comprising Khewat No.66, 67 situated in Moza 
Ballowal Tehsil & District Khushab. Said Fateh Khan passed 
away in 1937 leaving behind Mst. Fazlan (widow), Roshna, 
Jhallan, Sahibzadi and Bivi (daughters) as his legal heirs and his 
inheritance mutation No.145 dated 24.05.1937 was incorporated 
in favour of Mst. Fazlan (widow) as limited owner. Thereafter, 
Muslims Shariat Application Act was promulgated and 
succession of Fateh Khan was re-opened and mutation No.335 
dated 08.04.1969 was incorporated in favour of Mst. Fazlan 
(widow) and Mst. Sahibzadi (daughter), Ghulam Jillani and 
Munawar Khan (nephews). The respondents/plaintiffs contended 
that at the time of death, Fateh Khan had four daughters and one 
widow but while incorporating mutation No.335, three daughters 
namely Roshna, Jallan and Bivi were deprived from the 
inheritance. Mst. Bivi passed away in 1961 and her husband/Sher 
Muhammad (respondent No.6) challenged the validity of 
mutation No.335 before the Collector Joharabad, who vide order 
dated 28.07.1969 remanded the matter for correction of said 
mutation after incorporation of all legal heirs of Fateh Khan 
deceased. In the post remand proceedings mutation No.14 dated 
30.01.1982 was incorporated but in the said mutation, names of 
other three daughters of Fateh Khan namely Roshnai, Jallan and 
Mst. Bivi were again not incorporated as per Shariah. The 
respondents/plaintiffs filed application for correction of the 
revenue entries before the District Collector Khushab who vide 
order dated 11.11.2013 advised the respondents/plaintiffs to 
approach Civil Court for redressal of their grievance. Hence, the 
suit was filed.  
 
The 
petitioners/defendants 
filed 
contesting 
written 
statement whereas the other defendants were proceeded against

ex-parte. Out of the divergent pleadings of the parties, the trial 
Court framed following issues:- 
1. Whether the Fateh Khan s/o Wali Muhammad was 
succeeded by Fazlan as wife, Roshana, Jalan, Sahab 
Zadi and Bevi as daughters? OPP 
2. Whether plaintiff/predecessor plaintiffs are entitled to 
succeed inheritance of Fateh Khan s / o Wali 
Muhammad?  OPP 
3. Whether mutation No.335 dated 08.01.1961 and 
subsequent mutation No.14 dated 30.01.1982 were 
sanctioned fraudulently by depriving all the legal heirs 
of Fateh Khan including Bevi and Jalan and above said 
mutations are liable to be set aside qua rights plaintiffs? 
OPP 
4. Whether plaintiffs are entitled to get decree of 
declaration as prayed for? OPP 
5.  Whether Sahab Zadi was the only daughter of Fateh 
Khan out of his wedlock with Fazlan? OPD 
6.  Whether predecessor of plaintiffs were not legal heirs of 
Fateh Khan? OPD 
7. Whether plaintiffs were estopped by their own words 
and conduct to file this suit? OPD 
8. Whether this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this suit 
as mutation was sanctioned during consolidation 
proceedings? OPD 
9. Whether impugned mutations were sanctioned in 
accordance with law? OPD 
10. Whether this suit is liable to be dismissed with cost? 
OPD 
11. Relief.  
And recorded pro and contra evidence of the parties and finally 
decreed the suit vide judgment & decree dated 26.03.2019. Being 
aggrieved, the petitioners filed appeal which was dismissed by 
the appellate Court vide judgment & decree dated 25.06.2021. 
Hence, these civil revisions.   
4. 
I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have 
gone through the record. 
5. 
To prove the assertions made in the plaint and to dislodge 
the onus of issues No.1 to 4, respondent/Rab Nawaz appeared as 
P.W.1 and  deposed that the suit property was owned by Fateh 

 
C.R.No.60420/2021

Khan s/o Wali; that Fateh Khan passed away in the year 1937 
leaving behind a widow Fazlan as well as four daughters namely 
Roshnai, Jallan, Bivi and Sahibzadi; that after the death of Fateh 
Khan, mutation of inheritance No.145 dated 24.05.1937 was 
entered in favour of Fazlan as limited owner; that after 
promulgation of Shariat Act, the limited ownership was abolished 
upon which revenue officials incorporated mutation No.335 
whereby Fazlan (widow) got 1/8 share and Sahibzadi (daughter) 
got 1/2 share whereas the names of other three daughters were 
omitted at the time of recording of said inheritance mutation; that 
the daughters were alive at the time of death of Fateh Khan; that 
husband of Mst. Bivi namely Sher Muhammad filed an 
application against mutation No.335; that Mst. Bivi died in 1961; 
that the death certificate was produced before the District 
Collector who remanded the matter with the direction that if at 
the time of death of Fateh Khan, Mst. Bivi, Jallan and Roshnai 
were alive, their respective shares may be given to them; that in 
remand the Revenue Officer did not send any notice to the 
plaintiffs nor summoned them; that Sher Muhammad filed an 
application for compliance of remand order upon which it 
revealed that a fresh mutation No.14 was incorporated in 1982 in 
the revenue record; that they filed an application for correction of 
the said mutation; that Ghulam Farooq defendant got recorded his 
statement that if the plaintiffs are entitled for share as per Shariah, 
they would have no objection on correction of mutations; that the 
District Collector observed that the matter is complicated one as 
such the plaintiffs should approach Civil Court. Sher Muhammad 
(P.W.2) 
also 
fully 
supported 
the 
stance 
of 
the 
respondents/plaintiffs. Despite lengthy cross examination, the 
witnesses remained firm on their stance. 
6. 
Conversely, the petitioners/defendants produced sole 
witness namely, Ghulam Farooq (D.W.1) who deposed that:

Admittedly, Fateh Khan, owner of the suit land, died in 
1937 leaving behind one widow (Mst. Fazlan) and four daughters 
(Mst. Roshna, Jallan, Bivi and Sahibzadi) as his legal heirs but 
his inheritance mutation was entered in favour of his widow as 
limited owner. After promulgation of West Pakistan Muslim 
Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1948 the inheritance 
mutation of Fateh Khan was reviewed but again his three 
daughters i.e. Mst. Roshna, Jallan and Bivi were excluded from 

 
C.R.No.60420/2021 
 
6
his inheritance. The relationship of respondents/plaintiffs with 
Fateh Khan as daughter as well as depriving them from the 
legacy of their deceased predecessor are admitted by the 
respondents/defendants, thus admitted facts need not to be 
proved. Reliance is placed on the cases of Mst. Nur Jehan Begum 
through LRs v. Syed Mujtaba Ali Naqvi (1991 SCMR 2300) and 
Mst. Rehmat and others Vs. Mst. Zubaida Begum and others 
(2021 SCMR 1534).   
8. 
Admittedly, deceased Fateh Muhammad Khan as well as 
the parties to lis are Muslims by faith and followers of Quran and 
Sunnah. Even as per Article 227 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the principles of Quran and 
Sunnah are admitted as supreme law of this country and all 
provisions, rules, regulations are to be legislated and framed 
within the precincts of Islamic principles.  For reference, Article 
227 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 is 
reproduced as under:- 
227. Provisions relating to the Holy Quran and Sunnah.-
(1) All existing laws shall be brought in conformity with the 
Injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and 
Sunnah, in this Part referred to as the Injunctions of Islam, 
and no law shall be enacted which is repugnant to such 
injunctions. 
 
Explanation.-In the application of this clause to the 
personal law of any Muslim sect, the expression “Quran 
and Sunnah” shall mean the Quran and Sunnah as 
interpreted by that sect. 
 
(2) Effect shall be given to the provisions of clause (1) only 
in the manner provided in this Part. 
(3) Nothing in this Part shall affect the personal laws of 
non-Muslim citizens or their status as citizens. 
 
As the predecessor-in-interest of the parties of the lis as well as 
the parties themselves are Muslims and principles of Quran and 
Sunnah are mandatorily and manifestly applicable upon them as 
well. The shares of each and every Muslim inheritor have 

 
C.R.No.60420/2021 
 
7
conclusively been prescribed in Holy Quran. Allah Almighty has 
ordained the Muslims to decide their disputes as per the 
principles of the Holy Quran as described in following verses: 
ا ور
وج ہلصیف ہن رکے اس (اتکب) ےک اطمقب ےسج انزل رفکلگ  اہلل ےن وت وُیہ ول گ اکرف ںیہ۔﴿
  آتی ربمن8 وسرۃ اآملدئۃ۴۴
﴾
 
ا ور وج ہلصیف ہن رکے اس (اتکب) ےک اطمقب ےسج ااترا اہلل ےن وت وُیہ ولگ اظمل ںیہ۔﴿ 
  آتی ربمن8 وسرۃ اآملدئۃ۴۴
﴾
 
ا ور
وج ہلصیف ہن رکںی اس ےک اطمقب ےسج اہلل اعتٰیل ےن اُاترا ےہ وت وُیہ ولگ افقس ںیہ۔ ﴿ 
  آتی ربمن8 وسرۃ اآملدئۃ۴۴
 ﴾
 
) انجب ومالان حتف دمحم اجدنلرھی8(رتہمج 
 
The rights or shares of each and every Muslim heirs in the estate 
of his/her deceased propositus is absolutely, conclusively and 
finally described/determined in the Holy Quran, which shares are 
definite in nature. In this regard, it is expedient to take guidance 
from the Holy Quran, particularly from Surah tul Nisa Ayat 
Nos.7 to 11 (English translation whereof by Marmaduke 
Pickthall and Urdu translation by Molana Fateh Muhammad 
Jalandari) are reproduced as under:- 
7. Unto the men (of a family) belongeth a share of that which 
parents and near kindred leave, and unto the women a share of 
that which parents and near kindred leave, whether it be little 
or much. A legal share. 
8. And when kinsfolk and orphans and the needy are present at 
the division (of the heritage), bestow on them therefrom and 
speak kindly unto them. 
9. And let those fear (in their behaviour toward orphans) who 
if they left behind them weak offspring would be afraid for 
them. So let them mind their duty to Allah, and speak justly. 
10. Lo! Those who devour the wealth of orphans wrongfully, 
they do but swallow fire into their bellies. And they will be 
exposed to burning flame. 
11. Allah commands you concerning (the provision for) your 
children; to the male the equivalent of the portion of two 
females, and if there be only women more than two, then theirs 
is two-thirds of the inheritance, and if there be one (only) then 
for her is the half. And to each of his parents a sixth of the 
inheritance, if he have a son; and if he have no son and his 
parents are his heirs, then to his mother appertaineth the 
third; but if he have brethren, then to his mother appertaineth 
the sixth, after any legacy he may have bequeathed, or debt 
(hath been paid). Your parents and your children: Ye know not 
which of them is nearer unto you in usefulness. It is an 
injunction from Allah. Lo! Allah is knower, Wise.

Moreover, according to Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Shariat 
Application Act, 1937, the Shariat Laws were made applicable 
where the parties are/were Muslims. Section 2 of the Act ibid is 
reproduced as under: 
2.Application 
of 
Personal 
Law 
to 
Muslim.-
Notwithstanding any custom or usage to the contrary, in 
all questions (save questions relating to special property 
of females, including personal property inherited or 
obtained under contract or gift or any other provision of 
Personal Law, marriage, dissolution of marriage, 
including talaq, ila, zihar, lian, khula and mubarat 
maintenance, dower, guardianship, gifts, trusts and trust 
properties, and wakfs other than charities and charitable 
institutions and charitable and religious endowments the 
rule of decisions in cases where the parties are Muslims 
shall be the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) 
 
 
Section of 3 of the West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) 
Application Act, 1948 in this regard is also reproduced as under: 
“3.         In respect of immovable property held by a Muslim 
female as a limited owner under the Customary Law, 
succession shall be deemed to open out on the termination of 
her limited interest to all persons who would have been 
entitled to inherit the property at the time of the death of the 
last full owner had the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) been 
applicable at the time of such death, and in the event of the 
death of any such person before the termination of the limited 
interest mentioned above, succession shall devolve on his heirs 
and successors existing at the time of the termination of the 
limited interest of the female as if the aforesaid such person 
had died at the termination of the limited interest of the female 
and had been governed by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat); 
 
             Provided that the share, which the female limited 
owner would have inherited had the Muslim Personal Law 
(Shariat) been applicable at the time of the death of the last 41 
owner, shall devolve on her if she loses her limited interest in 
the property on account of her marriage or re-marriage and 
on her heirs under the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) if her 
limited interest terminates because of death.” 
 
The West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Act, 1962 was 
also promulgated in this regard, Section 2 whereof is reproduced 
as under: 
2. 
 
 
Application 
of 
the 
Muslim 
Personal 
Law.— 
Notwithstanding any custom or usage, in all questions 

 
C.R.No.60420/2021 
 
10
regarding succession (whether testate or intestate), special 
property of females, betrothal, marriage, divorce, dower, 
adoption, guardianship, minority, legitimacy or bastardy, 
family relations, wills, legacies, gifts, religious usages or 
institutions, including waqfs, trusts and trust properties, the 
rule of decision, subject to the provisions of any enactment for 
the time being in force, shall be the Muslim Personal Law 
(Shariat) in case where the parties are Muslims.” 
 
Reliance in this regard is placed on cases titled as The Federation 
of Pakistan through Secretary, Law & Parliamentary Affairs, 
Islamabad vs. Muhammad Ishaq and another (PLD 1983 SC 
273), Abdul Ghafoor and others Vs. Muhammad Shafi and others 
(PLD 1985 SC 407), Mst. Fazal Jan Vs. Roshan Din and others 
(PLD 1990 SC 661), Ismail and another Vs. Ghulam Qadir and 
others (1990 SCMR 1667), Sardar Vs. Mst. Nehmat Bi and 8 
others (1992 SCMR 82), Muhammad Yousaf through Legal 
Heirs and 2others Vs. Mst. Karam Khatoon through Legal Heirs 
and 2 others (2003 SCMR 1535), Ghulam Haider and others Vs.

501), Fayyaz Hussain and others Vs. Haji Jan Muhammad and 
others (2018 SCMR 698), Ghulam Qasim and others Vs. Mst. 
Razia Begum and others (PLD 2021 SC 812), Abdul Khaliq 
(deceased) through LRs. Vs. Fazalur Rehman and others (2022 
SCMR 1665) and Manzoor Hussain (deceased) through Legal 
Heirs and others Vs. Muhammad Rafique and others (2020 CLC 
400). 
9. 
As regard the objection of the petitioners/defendants that 
the suit is time barred. Admittedly, the moment Fateh Khan 
closed his eyes, all his legal heirs according to the principles of 
Quran and Shariah became absolute owner to the extent of their 
respective shares in estate of the deceased and without resorting 
to the legal course of independent transaction, the said ownership 
cannot be taken away by means of any unauthorized entry in the 
revenue record and if any entry is made in clandestine manner

with collusiveness of the revenue staff, such entry is devoid of 
any legality and creating any valid right. The main object of 
registration and sanctioning of mutation of inheritance is mere 
formality to update the official record whereas all legal heirs of a 
deceased become absolute owners of the property to the extent of 
their respective share until and unless they themselves voluntarily 
and legally further alienate their said share/right and the said legal 
heirs by operation of law become joint owners in the estate 
having constructive possession over their share and no limitation 
runs against the inheritance matters as well as against any 
patently void order entry. Reliance is placed on a latest judgment 
cited as Ghulam Qasim and others Vs. Mst. Razia Begum and 
others (PLD 2021 SC 812) wherein the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has held as under: 
“4. Immediately on the death of a person, his/her legal 
heirs become owner of his estate under Muslim law. In the 
case of Ghulam Ali v. Mst. Ghulam Sarwar Naqvi it was 
held that: 
The main points of the controversy in this behalf 
get resolved on the touchstone of Islamic law of 
inheritance. As soon as an owner dies, succession 
to his property opens. There is no State 
intervention or clergy’s intervention needed for 
the passing of the title immediately, to the heirs. 
Thus, it is obvious that a Muslim’s estate legally 
and juridically vests immediately on his death in 
his or her heirs and their rights respectively come 
into separate existence forthwith. The theory of 
representation of the estate by an intermediary is 
unknown to Islamic Law of inheritance as 
compared to other systems. Thus there being no 
vesting of the estate of the deceased for an 
interregnum in any one like an executor or 
administrator, 
it 
devolves 
on 
the 
heirs 
automatically, and immediately in definite shares 
and fraction. 
 
The above-noted principle has been continuously affirmed, 
including in the cases of Mst. Reshman Bibi v Amir, Mirza 
Abid Baig v Zahid Sabir, and Farhan Aslam v Mst. Nuzba 
Shaheen.

Another reliance is placed on the cases titled as Ghulam Ali and 2 
others Vs. Mst. Ghulam Sarwar Naqvi (PLD 1990 SC 1), Khan 
Muhammad through L.Rs. and others Vs. Mst.Khatoon Bibi and 
others (2017 SCMR 1476) and Bashir Ahmad Anjum Vs. 
Muhammad Raffique and others (2021 SCMR 772). Thus, the 
argument of learned counsel for the petitioners/defendants is 
hereby repelled. 
10. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners has not pointed out any 
illegality or material irregularity, mis-reading and non-reading of 
evidence in the impugned judgments and decrees passed by the 
learned Courts below and has also not identified any 
jurisdictional defect. The concurrent findings of fact are against 
the petitioners which do not call for any interference by this 
Court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction in absence of any 
illegality or any other error of jurisdiction. Reliance is placed on 
the case titled as Mst. Zaitoon Begum v. Nazar Hussain and 
another (2014 SCMR 1469). 
11. 
In view of above, both these civil revisions being devoid 
of any merit are dismissed. No order as to costs.
