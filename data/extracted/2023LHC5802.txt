a) 
the Petitioner having specifically performed the 
offshore part of the EPC contract and the

I. 
CONTEXT  
2. 
As per contents of petition, the “Petitioner” is an offshore 
Company duly registered in Singapore and engaged in import, export, 
commission agency, sale of wind power equipment, design, research, 
development and installation of wind power equipment and relevant 
products. The “Petitioner” it is a subsidiary of Nordex Energy GMBH 
with ultimate shareholder being NORDEX S.E. a Company listed at 
stock exchange in Germany and has no permanent establishment in 
Pakistan in terms of the definition provided under section 2(41) of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 ( the “Ordinance”), therefore, as per 
version of the “Petitioner” the equipment and goods acquired offshore 
were required to directly reach in Pakistan to FFC Energy Limited/the 
Respondent No.3 (the “FFCEL”) in its own name by opening valid 
letters of credit and after fulfillment of all the legal requirements in 
force in Pakistan. The title in equipment and goods directly imported by 
FFCEL alongwith all the related risks and rewards of ownership were 
transferred to FFCEL outside the territory of Pakistan, with the result 
that FFCEL was responsible for payment of the duties of customs, 
import and related taxes thereon at the import stage as well as all such 
payments in respect of imported equipment & goods were directly 
made by FFCEL to Petitioner partially in advance and the balance after 
completion of report. The “Petitioner” moved an application to the 
Respondent No.1/FBR on 04th April 2011, in terms of section 206-A (i) 
of the “Ordinance” read with rule 231-A of the Rules 2002, (a) stating 
true facts of the transaction; (b) demanding advance ruling keeping in 
view (i) the Income Tax Ordinance 2001; (ii) Avoiding Double 
Taxation 
Treaty 
(ADTT) 
between 
Pakistan 
and 
Singapore 
Governments related to procurement and supply of goods of FFCEL; 
(iii) pointing out that “Petitioner” does not have any permanent 
establishment in Pakistan; and (iv) notifying the Commissioner to the 
payment to Petitioner to be made without deduction of tax under 
section 152 and 153 of the “Ordinance”. Pursuant to filing of above 
said application, the Respondent No.2 passed order dated 04.11.2013 

Writ Petition No.420 of 2014                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   3 
whereby FFCEL was directed to deduct tax from the “Petitioner” 
before remitting the payments on the rates specified in Division-II Part-
III of the First Schedule to the “Ordinance” and above said order was 
communicated by the Respondent No.3/FFCEL to the “Petitioner” by 
stating that payment shall be made after deduction of tax as directed. 
Hence, this Petition.  
II. 
PETITIONER’S ARGUMENTS. 
3.  
Learned counsel for the Petitioner Mr. Shahbaz Butt, ASC  
inter-alia contended that the Petitioner, being an offshore company in 
Singapore, entered into an agreement with the FFCEL for supply of 
goods/equipment, including wind power plant and, while performing 
the offshore part of the Engineering, Procurement and Construction 
Contract (EPC), issue of deduction of income tax from the payment 
made to it was raised by Respondent No.3/FFCEL before the 
Respondent/Federal Board of Revenue by filing an application on 
which, the Commissioner concerned passed detailed order dated 
04.11.2013 under Section 152 of the “Ordinance”; that the 
Commissioner, in aforesaid order, observed that the business profits of 
the “Petitioner”, in respect of procurement and supply of goods to the 
taxpayer company outside Pakistan, are not chargeable to income tax 
under the “Ordinance” and in this regard a specific direction was 
issued to the FFCEL, which is not paying attention to the said direction 
in true spirit; that the “Petitioner” is only seeking a clarification that 
being an offshore Company, the “Petitioner” is not liable to pay 
income tax; that the Respondent No.2, without adopting proper 
procedure and providing fair right of hearing, straight away passed the 
impugned order; that the “Petitioner” is seeking direction to the 
Respondents to declare that being non-resident Company, it is not 
liable to tax deduction under Section 152 “Ordinance”; that a direction 
be issued to the Respondent No.3 to make payment to the “Petitioner” 
without deduction of tax; that the “Petitioner” is seeking exemption 
from deduction of tax in terms of Section 152(7)(a) of the 
“Ordinance”, which requires interpretation by this Court.

III. 
RESPONDENTS ARGUMENTS. 
Submissions by Dr. Farhat Zafar, ASC for Respondent 
No.1/FBR 
 
4. 
Conversely, Dr. Farhat Zafar, ASC for the Respondent 
No.1/FBR inter alia raised objection qua maintainability of this petition 
on the ground that the “Petitioner” has no locus standi to file this 
petition and not an aggrieved party as the Respondent/FBR has not 
passed order against the “Petitioner”; that the “Petitioner” is 
admittedly an offshore Company, which has no direct nexus with the 
Federal Board of Revenue; that “Petitioner” has alternate remedy 
available against impugned order by filing revision in terms of Sections 
122A or 122B of the “Ordinance” and therefore, this petition is 
premature being an attempt to preempt the levy of income tax under the 
law; that the Nordex Energy GMBH Erich-Schlesinger-Strike is the 
parent company, which has its permanent establishment in Pakistan in 
the shape of M/s. Nordex Pakistan Private Limited, which is also 
engaged in a supervisory activity and the parent company’s profits 
include income from the instant venture in Pakistan, therefore; the 
arguments of the Petitioner are not sustainable in the eye of law; that 
the parent company is trying to evade the due tax simply by changing 
hands and prompting the “Petitioner” as the only beneficiary of 
remittances despite of the fact that the “Petitioner” itself admitted the 
execution of contract with all the members of the EPC.  
 
Submission by Barrister Raja Jibran Tariq Ali, Advocate for the 
Respondent No.3/FFCEL. 
 
5. 
Barrister Raja Jibran Tariq Ali, inter alia submitted that the 
Respondent No.3/FFCEL is a special purpose public limited company 
which has been established and set up under the laws of Pakistan and is 
incorporated under the repealed Companies Ordinance 1984, now 
Companies Act, 2017; that the FFCEL is a subsidiary of Fauji Fertilizer 
Company Limited and entered into an EPC contract with the 
“Petitioner”, whereby each party has been assigned separate functions 

Writ Petition No.420 of 2014                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   5 
to be performed at different periods of execution; that the payment 
terms for the “Petitioner” are distinct as per Schedule 16 of the EPC 
Contract, however payments to all contractors are linked with 
mobilization advances and achievement of milestones mentioned in the 
EPC Contract; that total consideration payable to the “Petitioner” was 
Rs.57.26 Million USD (Rs. 5.1 Billion) for provision of Plant 
Machinery, the offshore part of the EPC Contract; that on 19.06.2013, 
Respondent No.1/FBR directed the FFCEL to furnish a notice in 
writing under Section 152(5) “Ordinance” expressing payment to  
non-resident person and thereafter the application of FFCEL was 
decided on 04.11.2013 holding that the case of “Petitioner” does not 
qualify for exemption under the relevant law primarily on the ground 
that connected parties to the EPC contractors had permanent 
establishment(s) in Pakistan; that plea of the “Petitioner” as well as 
FFCEL was overlooked with regard to the fact that ownership of 
equipment purchased from “Petitioner” was transferred in the name of 
Respondent No.3/FFCEL outside the jurisdiction of Pakistan; that the 
Respondent No.2 did not properly evaluate/consider the real facts and 
material available on record, and wrongly directed the FFCEL to 
deduct tax from the “Petitioner” before remitting the payments to it; 
that according to agreement of EPC with FFCEL the supply of 
equipment was to be made through “Petitioner”, but the ultimate 
destination of income from this project has already been admitted by 
the parent Company of Nordex Pakistan Private Limited, hence the 
remittances can be made to it, which is subject to tax under Section 152 
of the “Ordinance”.  
6. 
I have heard the arguments and perused the record. 
IV. 
DETERMINATION BY COURT 
7. 
It evinces from the record that the “Petitioner” moved an 
application to the Respondent No.1/FBR on 04th April 2011, in terms of 
Section 206-A(i) of the “Ordinance” read with Rule 231-A of the 
Income Tax Rules 2002 (“the Rules”). For ready reference the 
aforesaid Sections/Rules are reproduced as follows: 

Writ Petition No.420 of 2014                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   6 
“SECTION 206-A:

(2)  
Where the taxpayer has made a full and 
true disclosure of the nature of all aspects of the 
transaction relevant to the ruling and the 
transaction has proceeded in all material 
respects 
as 
described 
in 
the 
taxpayer’s 
application for the ruling, the ruling is binding on 
the Commissioner with respect to the application 
to the transaction of the law as it stood at the 
time the ruling was issued.”  
“RULE 231-A:  
(1) 
A non-resident person desiring an advance 
ruling under section 206A of the Ordinance, 2001 
(XLIX of 2001) shall make an application to the

set out in the Schedule below.  
(2)  
The application under sub-rule (1) shall be

   7 
(6) 
The 
copy 
of 
the 
advance 
ruling 
pronounced by the Federal Board of Revenue 
shall be provided to the applicant and to the 
Commissioner of Income Tax having jurisdiction 
over the case.  
(7) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this 
rule, the advance ruling shall cease to be binding 
on the Commissioner, if it is subsequently found

by 
fraud 
or 
misrepresentation of facts about the nature of the 
transaction on which advance ruling was issued.  
(8) 
An application filed under this rule shall 
be disposed of not later than ninety days of its 
receipt.” 
 
8. 
Pertinently, the “Petitioner” mentioned down all the facts of the 
case in his aforementioned application filed under Section 206-A of the 
“Ordinance” and Rule No.231-A of the “Rules”, whereupon the FBR, 
vide its letter C.No. 6(2)I&T. Taxes/2011 dated 24th May 2011 required 
the “Petitioner” to provide further information, which was provided on 
28th June 2011 and forwarded the application for advance ruling to the 
Chief Commissioner Inland Revenue, LTU, Lahore in terms of letter 
No. LT-4904-11 dated 12th July 2011. Non-decision of above said 
application prompted the “Petitioner” to furnish reminders respectively 
on 22nd January 2013, 14th March 2013 and then on 19th April 2013. 
Thereafter, during the pendency of advance ruling as aforesaid, the 
Respondent FBR, in terms of letter C.No. 6(2) Int-Taxes/11-826-48-R 
dated 19th June 2013 directed the Respondent No. 3/FFCEL to 
approach 
the 
concerned 
Commissioner 
Inland 
Revenue 
by 
furnishing/submitting a notice in writing in terms of sub-section (5) of 
Section 152 of the “Ordinance”, expressing intention of payment to the 
“Petitioner” without deduction of tax. Consequently, the FFCEL filed 
notice under section 152(5) of the “Ordinance” before the Respondent 
No.2/Commissioner Inland Revenue in terms of letter dated 04th 
September 2013. The Respondent No.2, through its Assistant 
Commissioner Inland Revenue, Enforcement-II, Zone-I, RTO, 
Rawalpindi, required the “Petitioner” and the Respondent No.3 vide 
notice dated 17th September 2013 to furnish copy of the ADTT and 

Writ Petition No.420 of 2014                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   8 
further details and, after receiving the aforesaid particulars, the 
Respondent No.2 passed the impugned order dated 04.11.2013, against 
the Respondent No.3/FFCEL and directed it to deduct tax from the 
“Petitioner” before remitting the payments to it. During the course of 
hearing, learned counsel for the Respondent No.3/FFCEL partially 
admitted that, according to agreement EPC between the Petitioner and 
the Respondent No.3/FFCEL, the supply of equipment was to be made 
through Petitioner, whereas the ultimate destination of income from this 
project has already been admitted by the parent Company of Nordex 
Pakistan Private Limited. Whilst passing impugned order, the 
provisions of Section 152 of the “Ordinance” have been based, which 
Section 152 is reproduced as follows: 
 
“SECTION 152:  
(1) 
Every person paying an amount of 
royalties or fees for technical services to a 
non-resident person that is chargeable to tax 
under section 6 shall deduct tax from the gross 
amount paid at the rate specified in Division IV 
of Part II of the First Schedule.  
(2)  
Subject to sub-section (3), every person 
paying an amount to a non-resident person 
(other than an amount to which sub-section (1) 
applies) shall deduct tax from the gross amount 
paid at the rate, specified in Division II of Part 
III of the First Schedule.  
(3)  
Sub-section (2) does not apply to an 
amount:-  
(a) 
that is subject to deduction of tax under 
section 149, 150, 153, 155 or 156;  
(b)  
with 
the 
written 
approval 
of 
the 
Commissioner that is taxable to a permanent 
establishment in Pakistan of the non-resident 
person;  
(c)  
that is payable by a person who is liable to 
pay tax on the amount as representative of the 
non-resident person under sub-section (3) of 
section 172; or  
(d)  
where the non-resident person is not 
chargeable to tax in respect of the amount.  
(4)  
Where 
a 
person 
claims 
to 
be 
a 
representative of a non-resident person for the 
purposes of clause (c) of sub-section (3), the 

Writ Petition No.420 of 2014                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   9 
person shall file a declaration to that effect with 
the Commissioner prior to making any payment 
to the non-resident person.  
(5)  
Where a person intends to make a payment 
to a non-resident person without deduction of tax 
under this section, the person shall, before 
making 
the 
payment, 
furnish 
to 
the 
Commissioner a notice in writing setting out:-  
(a)  
the name and address of the non-resident 
person; and  
(b)  
the nature and amount of the payment.  
(6)  
Where 
a 
person 
has 
notified 
the 
Commissioner of a payment under sub-section 
(5) and the Commissioner has reasonable 
grounds to believe that the non-resident person is 
chargeable to tax under this Ordinance in 
respect of the payment, the Commissioner may, 
by notice in writing, direct the person making the 
payment to deduct tax from the payment in 
accordance with subsection (2).  
(7)  
Sub-section (5) shall not apply to a 
payment on account of:  
(a)  
an import of goods where title to the goods 
passes outside Pakistan, except an the import 
that is part of an overall arrangement for the 
supply of goods, their installation, and any 
commission and guarantees in respect of the 
supply where:-  
(i) the supply is made by the head office outside 
Pakistan 
of 
a 
person 
to 
a 
permanent 
establishment of the person in Pakistan;  
(ii) the supply is made by a permanent 
establishment of the person outside Pakistan to a 
permanent establishment of the person in 
Pakistan;  
(iii) the supply is made between associates; or  
(iv) the supply is made by a resident person or a 
Pakistan 
permanent 
establishment 
of 
a 
non-resident person; or  
(b)  
educational and medical expenses remitted 
in accordance with the regulations of the State 
Bank of Pakistan. 
(3)  
Where there is any inconsistency between 
a circular and an advance ruling, priority shall 
be given to the terms of the advance ruling.” 
 
9. 
Bare examining of the impugned order reveals that the 
Commissioner did not discuss all the points raised by the “Petitioner” 

Writ Petition No.420 of 2014                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   10 
and the Respondent No.3/FFCL i.e. true facts of the transaction, 
demanding advance ruling keeping in view the “Ordinance”, avoiding 
Double Taxation Treaty (ADTT) between Pakistan and Singapore 
Governments related to procurement and supply of goods of FFCEL 
and that the “Petitioner” does not have any permanent establishment in 
Pakistan as well as that notifying the Commissioner regarding the 
payment to “Petitioner” was to be made without deduction of tax 
under Section 512 and 153 of the “Ordinance”. It also reveals from the 
impugned order that the Respondent No.2 has neither considered the 
version of the “Petitioner” nor provided any solid grounds or 
mentioned the relevant provision of law, thus, passed a non-speaking 
order which is not sustainable in the eye of law i.e. Sections 206-A and 
152 of the “Ordinance”. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of 
“MOLLAH EJAHAR ALI Versus GOVERNMENT OF EAST PAKISTAN 
and others” (PLD 1970 SC 173) has explained the need and 
importance for passing a speaking order by stating that:  
"There is no doubt that the High Court's order 
which is unfortunately perfunctory gives the 
impression of a hasty off-hand decision which, 
although found to be correct in its result, is 
most deficient in its content. if a summary 
order of rejection can be made in such terms, 
there is no reason why a similar order of 
acceptance saying "there is considerable 
substance in the petition which is accepted", 
should not be equally blessed. This will 
reduce 
the 
whole 
judicial 
process 
to 
authoritarian decrees without the need for 
logic and reasoning which have always been 
the 
traditional 
pillars 
of 
judicial 
pronouncements investing them with their 
primary excellence of propriety and judicial 
balance. Litigants who bring their disputes to 
the law Courts with the incidental hardships 
and expenses involved do expect a patient and 
a judicious treatment of their cases and their 
determination by proper orders. A judicial 
order must be a speaking order manifesting 
by itself that the Court has applied its mind to 
the resolution of the issues involved for their 
proper adjudication. The ultimate result may 

Writ Petition No.420 of 2014                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   11 
be reached by a laborious effort, but if the 
final order does not bear an imprint of that 
effort 
and 
on 
the 
contrary 
discloses 
arbitrariness of thought and action, the 
feeling with its painful results, that justice has 
neither been done nor seems to have been 
done is inescapable. When the order of a 
lower Court contains no reasons, the 
appellate Court is deprived of the benefit of 
the views of the lower Court and is unable to 
appreciate the processes by which the 
decision has been reached." 
 
10. 
Similarly, the Courts in various judgments, has directed several 
authorities to adhere to the above-mentioned principle while passing a 
speaking order with reasons and after keeping in view the facts and 
circumstances of the case, applicable law as well as precedents, if 
available. Reliance is placed on the case titled “TOWN COMMITTEE, 
PIPLAN Versus Muhammad Hanif and others” (2008 SCMR 723). It 
is also worth mentioning that it is inalienable right of the Petitioner and 
Respondent No.3 to be treated in accordance with law by the 
Respondent/FBR and no action detrimental to the reputation, life, and 
liberty shall be taken except as per law and in the case in hand the 
relevant law is the “Ordinance” and the “Rules”. In said regard 
obligations of the public functionaries have been enumerated in case 
“GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN THROUGH DIRECTOR-GENERAL, 
MINISTRY OF INTERIOR, ISLAMABAD and others versus FARHEEN 
RASHID” (2011 SCMR 1) reading as follows:  
“It is the inalienable right of every citizen to 
be treated in accordance with law as 
envisaged by Article 4 of the Constitution. It 
is the duty and obligation of the public 
functionaries to act within the four corners of 
the mandate of the Constitution and Law. 
Even the Chief Executive of the Country is 
not above the Constitution and is bound to 
obey the command of the Constitution as 
envisaged 
under 
Article 
5(2) 
of 
the 
Constitution.”   
 

Writ Petition No.420 of 2014                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   12 
11. 
It has been further held in case reported as “Messrs UNITED 
WOOLLEN MILLS LTD. WORKERS' UNION versus Messrs UNITED 
WOOLLEN MILLS LTD” (2010 SCMR 1475) that “even the public 
functionaries are duty bound to decide the case after application of 
mind, after addition of section 24-A in the General Clauses Act”.  
Moreover, Article 10-A of the “Constitution” provides right of fair trial 
and due process for determination of rights and obligations. Hence, it is 
the duty and obligation of every public functionary, including the 
Respondent/FBR, to act within the four corners of the mandate of the 
“Constitution” and pass a speaking order. Reliance is placed on the 
judgment reported as “ALTAF IBRAHIM QURESHI and another versus 
AAM LOG ITTEHAD and others” (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 745) 
wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed that “the right of 
hearing of a party to a lis is one of the fundamental principles of our 
jurisprudence which is guaranteed by Article 10A of the Constitution in 
its assurance of a "fair trial and due process" to a litigant.” 
Furthermore, whilst signifying regulatory status and functions of FBR, 
this Court held in case “CHENAB FLOUR AND GENERAL MILLS 
versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and others” (PLD 2021 Lahore 
343) that “the FBR being regulator has powers and functions under 
Section4 of the Act which corresponds with the preamble of the Act and 
in furtherance of the object provided therein. The preamble mentioned 
above further emphasis the purpose of creating the Authority of FBR 
i.e. to:- (i) regulate; (ii) administer; (iii) manage; (iv) impose; (v) levy 
and collection of taxes and duties. The preamble if read with powers 
and functions of FBR empowers it to perform functions that are 
necessary to achieve the objectives and purposes of the Act.”  
12. 
It is however, observed that the Respondents No.1 and 2/FBR 
being the Regulator, on touchstone of above referred pronouncements, 
have not met their statutory obligations and impugned order has been 
passed by the Respondent No.2 against the provisions and all norms of 
law. Matter in issue was not timely decided in absolute form as well as 
common purpose of applications made under different statutory 

Writ Petition No.420 of 2014                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   13 
provisions was defeated, thus; such practice of the Respondents No.1 
and 2 has not only frustrated cause of justice, but has also added 
agonies of parties as well as has tiled additional burden and workload 
for this Court to take away precious time, energy and sources of 
machinery of law. 
13. 
Since the impugned order has been passed without properly 
hearing the “Petitioner” or its representative and the Respondent No.3 
and considering the EPC contract, against which remedy of revision 
under Sections 122A or 122B ibid, as argued by learned counsel for the 
Respondent/FBR, is available. It has been held in the case of “The 
Murree Brewery Co. Ltd. versus Pakistan through the Secretary to 
Government of Pakistan Works Division” (PLD 1972 SC 279) that 
“the rule that the High Court will not entertain a writ petition when 
other appropriate remedy is yet available, is not a rule of barring 
jurisdiction, but a rule by which the Court regulates its jurisdiction. 
One of the well-recognized exceptions to the general rule is a case 
where an order is attacked on the ground that it was wholly without 
authority. Where a statutory functionary acts mala fide or in a 
partial, unjust and oppressive manner, the High Court, in the 
exercise of its writ jurisdiction, has power to grant relief to the 
aggrieved party”. The dictum stated above is followed in case titled 
“SARGODHA TEXTILE MILLS LIMITED through General 
Manager versus HABIB BANK LIMITED through Manager and 
another” (2007 SCMR 1240) whereby the Supreme Court has held 
that “The High Court in the present case without appreciating the 
legal position declined to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it under 
the Constitution on technical ground and failed to dispose of writ 
petitions as well as the review petition on merits in accordance with 
law.”  
14. 
In the same path, this Court earlier held in case titled “M.C.R 
(PVT.) LTD. FRANCHISEE OF PIZZA HUT versus MULTAN 
DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY and others (2021 CLD 639) has also 
observed that:   

Writ Petition No.420 of 2014                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   14 
“even in the presence of alternate 
remedy, a Constitutional petition can be 
entertained upon the touchstone of in-
adequacy of the available remedy before 
the prescribed forum. However, this 
extra-ordinary jurisdiction can only be 
used in exceptional circumstances where 
violation of some statutory duty on the 
part of a statutory authority is apparently 
established or impugned action or order 
reflects glaring illegality or is tainted 
with obvious malice or is identifiably 
passed as coram-non judice. … the most 
essential ingredient to determine the 
question of maintainability of such 
petition is not only the availability of 
'alternate remedy' but the most vital and 
determining factor is that such alternate 
remedy must also be 'adequate and 
efficacious.”  
 
15. 
It is worth mentioning that the impugned order has been passed 
against intent, object and spirit of relevant law setting prescribed 
standards and norms, thus, in light of what has been discussed above, 
this Court is not inclined to restrict scope of this constitutional 
petition mere due to reason that the Petitioner could have preferred 
a revision against impugned order. Importantly, Sections 206-A and 
152(5) are interconnected and in the impugned order, care has not been 
taken that provisions of Section 152 of the “Ordinance” and Section 
206-A are intertwined and were required to be read together 
simultaneously for purpose of deciding issue, therefore; in order to 
advance the cause of justice and to prevent miscarriage of justice as laid 
down in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan cited as “MIAN 
ASGHAR ALI versus GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB through Secretary 
(Colonies) BOR, Lahore and others” (2017 SCMR 118), the writ 
petition is allowed, impugned order dated 04.11.2013, is set-aside and 
the matter is remitted to the Respondent No.2/Commissioner Inland 
Revenue (Zone-I), Rawalpindi, who shall decide the same afresh 
strictly in accordance with law and EPC contract by providing proper 
hearing to all concerned including the “Petitioner” and Respondent 

Writ Petition No.420 of 2014

No.3/FFCE, within a period of two (02) months from receipt of 
certified copy of this order. The representative of “Petitioner” and the 
Respondent No.3 alongwith certified copy of this order shall appear 
before the said Respondent on 30.11.2023 at 11:00 A.M. Moreover, in 
the light of the law laid down by this Court in “SHAHEEN 
MERCHANT versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN/NATIONAL 
TARIFF COMMISSION and others” (2021 PTD 2126 Lahore) and 
“SHELL PAKISTAN LIMITED versus PUNJAB THROUGH THE 
SECRETARY MINISTRY OF FINANCE and other” (2020 PTD 
1607), as a stopgap measure, it is directed that, till the decision by the 
Respondent No.2, no coercive measures shall be taken against the 
Petitioner by the Respondents.
