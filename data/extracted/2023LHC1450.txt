Mr. Asad Ali Bajwa, D.A.G. 
Mr. Muhammad Saad Bin Ghazi, A.A.G. 
 
Shahid Karim, J:-. This constitutional petition challenges 
the validity of Section 124-A of the Pakistan Penal Code, 
1860 (PPC) which provides that: 
124-A Sedition: Whoever by words, either spoken or 
written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or 
otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or 
contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection 
towards, the Federal or Provincial Government established 
by law shall be punished with imprisonment for life to 
which fine may be added, or with imprisonment which may 
extend to three years, to which fine may be added, or with 
fine. 
Explanation 1: The expression ".disaffection includes 
disloyalty and all feelings of enmity. 
Explanation 2: Comments expressing disapprobation of the 
measures of the Government with a view to obtain their 
alteration by lawful means, without exciting or attempting 
to excite hatred, contempt or disaffection, do not constitute 
an offence under this section.  
Explanation 3: Comments expressing disapprobation of the 
administrative or other action of the Government without 
exciting or attempting to excite hatred, contempt or 
disaffection, do not constitute an offence under this 
section.‖

2. 
The provision is titled „Sedition‟ and constitutes the 
offence of seditious writings and seditions libel.  This offence 
has historical origins and was always an offence at common 
law punishable with imprisonment or fine on the direction of 
the court.  According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, 
the provision is unconstitutional and offends the provisions of 
Articles 14, 19 and 19A of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the Constitution”).  In short, 
the petitioner invites this Court to square the provisions of 
section 124-A with Articles 14, 19 and 19A of the 
Constitution and to hold that since section 124-A contravenes 
and offends the fundamental rights enshrined in these Articles 
of the Constitution it is void in view of Article 8 of the 
Constitution which provides that any law insofar as it is 
inconsistent with the rights conferred by Chapter I Part II of 
the Constitution shall to the extent of such inconsistency be 
void. 
Standing: 
3. 
The petitioner is a social activist and a public spirited 
individual.  He has deep interest in the preservation of 
constitutionalism and representative democracy and has 
contended that the fundamental rights to freedom of speech 
and expression do not envisage the offence of seditious libel 
in its present form to be sustained.  I have no doubt that the 
petitioner has standing to maintain this petition.  In any case, 
none of the respondents have raised any objection regarding 
the standing of the petitioner.  Apart from this, the issue 
broached in this petition touches upon the foundational 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
3 
 
element of every citizen‟s life in Pakistan and has the 
invidious potential to upend our lives suddenly and 
irretrievably.  The counsels for the petitioner, Abuzar Salman 
Niazi, Barrister Daraab W. Furqan and Shezal Khan Burki, 
Advocates filed skeleton arguments and two bundles of case-
law and related material which proved immensely useful and 
made certain that the legal challenge was soundly based.  Mr. 
Abuzar Salman Niazi, Advocate led the arguments in this 
Court. 
History: 
4. 
A reference to the historical facts would lend actuality 
to the analysis.  The law of sedition was originally drafted in 
the year 1837 by Thomas Macaulay.  Section 124-A was 
inserted in PPC in 1870 through Penal Code (Amendment) 
Act, 1870 and according to the learned counsel for the 
petitioner was a tool to be employed by the colonial masters 
to suppress and muzzle the peoples‟ voices of dissent against 
the government in power.  Before the partition of sub-
continent prominent politicians across the divide were tried 
under the sedition law and this trend has continued after 
partition of the sub-continent by successive governments 
which made use of the sedition law to suppress voices of 
dissent.  He has pointed out that in Britain the law has been 
abolished through the Coroners and Justice Act, 2009 and in 
Australia following the recommendation of Australian Law 
Reform Commission it was repealed by the Australian 
legislature.  In New Zealand the act of sedition ceased to be a 
crime following the introduction of The Crimes (Repeal of 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
4 
 
Seditious Offences) Amendment Bill in 2007.  Similar 
examples have been cited by the learned counsel for the 
petitioner to contend that the crime of sedition and seditious 
libel is a relic of the past and civilized societies around the 
globe do not countenance its presence on the statute book. 
5. 
The learned counsel for the petitioner has presented a 
literary piece by A.G Noorani published on August 14, 2021 
in the magazine Frontline. A.G Noorani is a prominent 
activist, lawyer and journalist from India and the piece is 
titled „Sedition in Freedom Struggle‟. It refers to the history 
of the repressive laws of sedition and describes the history of 
India‟s struggle for freedom from British rule as the history of 
repressive laws of sedition in India. The article refers to the 
painstaking work by an English barrister at the Calcutta High 
Court Walter Russell Donagh, A Treaties on the Law of 
Sedition and Corporate Offences in British India which also 
engages a discussion on Vernacular Press Act which was 
sought to be introduced by the British colonists and the 
arguments made by British members of the Viceroy‟s Council 
which passed the Vernacular Press Act in 1878 a law which 
merely affirmed the law of sedition contained in Section 124-
A which had already been introduced in the year 1870 in 
PPC. One of the members of the Viceroy‟s Council stated 
that:  
 
“This is the class that writes for the Native Press, perorates 
on platforms, and generally vents its spleen upon the 
government which has not been able to find appointments 
for more than a friction of its members. To honest, well-
informed criticism no English government would ever 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
5 
 
object. But every government has the right to object when 
its critics wander off from criticism to calumny…. 
 
―No government such as ours in India can afford to allow 
the minds of an ignorant and credulous oriental 
population to be gradually poisoned and embittered by 
persistent calumny of the government and all its 
measures. If these sections lead to a more careful, well-
considered and responsible journalism, they will confer a 
benefit not only on the state and the public, but on the 
journalistic profession itself.‟” 
6. 
Speeches were made by other members which were to 
a similar effect and which primarily noted that British 
government could not afford to allow the minds of an 
ignorant and credulous oriental population to be gradually 
poisoned and embittered by persistent calumny of the 
government and all its measures.  The article by A.G Noorani 
then goes on to refer to the trials of Tilak in the following 
words: 
Tilak‘s two trials (1897 and 1908) for sedition exposed the 
falsehoods in the apologies of the draftsmen of the offence 
of ―sedition‖, which was to be later inserted in the Indian 
Penal Code. All the top leaders of the Indian National 
Congress were convicted of sedition—Mahatma Gandhi 
(1922), Maulana Azad (1922), Jawaharlal Nehru (1921, 
eight times.) 
There is, however, one case which Tilak won. On July 22, 
1916, in the Court of the District Magistrate of Poona, 
information was lodged against Tilak citing his speeches. 
He was asked to show cause why a bond of Rs.2,00,000 for 
―good behaviour‖ for one year should not be required of 
him under Section 105, 112 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code. Mohammad Ali Jinnah went all the way to Poona to 
defend Tilak but lost. On August 12, 1916, the Magistrate 
held against Tilak. Jinnah moved the High Court and won. 
The order was quashed. 
7. 
One of the founding fathers of the present India, 
Jawaharlal Nehru said in Parliament on May 29, 1951: 
 
Take again Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code. Now so 
far as I am concerned that particular section is highly 
objectionable and obnoxious and it should have no place 
both for practical and historical reasons, if you like, in any 
body of laws that we might pass. The sooner we get rid of it 
the better. We might deal with that matter in other ways, in 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
6 
 
more limited ways, as every other country does, but that 
particular thing, as it is, should have no place, because all 
of us have had enough experience of it in a variety of ways 
and apart from the logic of the situation, our urges are 
against it.‖ 
Nevertheless, in 1962, the Supreme Court of independent 
India upheld Section 124A of the Penal Code, which 
defines the offence of sedition, albeit with a tortuous 
proviso that made no sense. It is deeply worrying that the 
BJP government, headed by Narendra Modi, should use 
Section 124A to imprison student leaders and prosecute 
political leaders. 
8. 
Jawaharlal Nehru was also tried for the offence under 
Section 124-A as many as eight times.  Finally the learned 
author referred to a judgment by Allahabad High Court 
regarding section 124-A „Ram Nandan v State‘ I.L.R (1958) 2 
All. 84 and stated that each of the learned judges wrote a 
judgment of considerable learning and cogency of reasoning.  
The full bench of three judges Allahabad High Court 
unanimously held section 124A to be void.  This was 
however upset by the judgment of the Constitution Bench of 
the Supreme Court of India in a later case on January 20, 
1962 reported as Kedar Nath Singh v The State of Bihar 
(1963) 1 MLJ 40 (SC).  A.G Noorani also referred to the view 
of Lord Denning who said that ―the offence of seditious libel 
is now obsolete‖.   
9. 
Ms. Asma Hamid, amicus curie, filed a brief.  She 
alluded to the history of the law and also referred to a cluster 
of case law from different jurisdictions.  It was brought forth 
in the brief that the status of sedition laws has been currently 
put on hold by the Supreme Court of India until the 
government reexamines it.  The authorities from the United 
States and Australia have also been referred in the brief 
submitted by the amicus and which refers to the judgments 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
7 
 
handed down by the courts in these jurisdictions articulating 
the concept of freedom of speech and expression.  Ms. Asma 
Hamid referred to a case decided by the Supreme Court of 
Gambia which adjudicated on the constitutionality of laws 
relating to the offence of sedition.  In conclusion, Ms. Asma 
Hamid suggested this Court to follow the example of 
Supreme Court of Gambia on the ground that the present case 
had identical facts to the one before the Supreme Court of 
Gambia where the provisions relating to sedition were held to 
be intra vires the constitution.  In that case, the Supreme 
Court of Gambia was of the view that the courts should not 
decide upon constitutionality in the abstract and only real 
cases should be decided which give rise to questions of 
constitutionality.  
10. 
The decision of the Supreme Court of Gambia is, in 
my opinion, an inapt example to follow for any court under a 
constitution which guarantees constitutional rights including 
the right to freedom of speech and expression as also 
guarantees freedom of press.  It also does not comport with 
the rule laid down by the courts in Pakistan that not only that 
a challenge can be laid if a person is directly affected by an 
act under a law but a challenge can successfully be 
maintained if there is a potential for abuse of a provision 
mentioned in our criminal laws.  For, a person cannot be 
compelled to wait for his right to be infringed in order to 
bring a challenge to a particular provision in the law which in 
his opinion disregards a clear constitutional mandate.  The 
right to dignity enshrined in the Constitution confers upon a 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
8 
 
person to bring a challenge irrespective of whether criminal 
prosecution has been set in motion or not.  The right to 
dignity supports a prior challenge in any matter and in 
particular in the present case.  It is also inextricably linked 
with the concept of abuse of process of law which will be 
triggered as soon as prosecution is alleged against a citizen.  
The courts cannot allow a provision to stand and article 19 to 
be violated before ruling whether a fundamental right has 
been violated or not.  If we are called to make policy 
preferences then I would be compelled to take a leaf out of 
the progressive view of developed and liberal constitutional 
democracies which have done away with the law of sedition 
rather than relying upon a decadent view taken by the 
Supreme Court of Gambia.  That example does not serve as 
blazing a trail to be followed.  Our Parliament has been slow 
in realizing the urgency of repealing the law of sedition and 
so it is for the courts to step up and protect constitutional 
rights of the citizens. 
11. 
The English background to the repression of ideas and 
the crimes of seditious libel has been brought forth in „The 
First Amendment and the Fourth Estate, The Law of Mass 
Media by T. Barton Carter, Marc A. Franklin, Amy Kristin 
Sanders, Jay B. Wright (Eleventh Edition) as follows: 
In England, repression of ideas antithetical to the 
government dates back to the 13th century. In 1275 and 
again in 1379, Parliament made it criminal to speak 
against the state. Later known as ―seditious libel,‖ words, 
that questioned the crown in any way were punished by the 
King‘s Council sitting in the ―starred chamber.‖ 
Ecclesiastical laws forbidding heresy already existed, thus 
making it dangerous to say anything in opposition to the 
Church or the state. 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
9 
 
 
With the advent of printing, around 1500, the 
government became even more concerned about statements 
that questioned the secular powers. To prevent the wider 
dissemination that the printing press made possible, the 
Crown established a system of censorship, similar to one 
already used by the Church, for all publications. This 
repression lasted until almost 1700. 
 
The core of the censorship system was licensing. In 
the Elizabethan era, the system was overseen by agencies 
of the Queen. The Stationers Company, established in 
1556, gave a select group of London printers a monopoly 
over all printing in the country. Its members had the 
exclusive right to print certain categories of books, such as 
Bibles and spellers, and could search other printers‘ offices 
to look for ―illegal‖ materials. Because all printed matter 
had to be registered with the Stationers Company, complete 
prepublication review was possible. 
 
Violators of the licensing system were tried by the 
infamous Court of the Star Chamber, which became 
notorious 
for 
its 
secret 
proceedings 
and 
severe 
punishments. For example, William Prynn‘s book, Histrio-
Mastix, published without permission, said only whores 
acted in plays. The book appeared six weeks before Queen 
Elizabeth appeared briefly on stage, but Prynn was 
convicted of ridiculing the Queen. He was sentenced to a 
fine and life imprisonment, to be pilloried, and to have his 
ears docked. 
 
Bonding was also a part of the licensing system, 
forcing printers who were not part of the Stationers 
Company to post a large sum of money, known as a bond, 
before being granted a license to print. Publishing anything 
in opposition to the Church or crown meant forfeiture of 
the bond. 
An unlicensed publication meant more.  It could lead to 
charges of criminal libel, which was divided into four 
categories; (1) blasphemous libel involved heretical 
statements opposing the Church; (2) obscene or immoral 
libel dealt with unpermitted literary subject matter; (3) 
private libel involved offending words directed to private 
individuals, which also could lead to civil action (suing the 
publisher for monetary damages to assuage the harm to the 
offended person‘s reputation); 4 seditious libel was 
criticism of the crown.  Frederick Siebert in Freedom of the 
Press in England 1476-1776 (1952) said that ―convictions 
for seditious libel ran into hundreds‖ during the 17th and 
18th centuries in Great Britain.‖ 
 
12. 
Thus, at common law, the crime of seditious libel dates 
back to the year 1275 and constitutes words that question the 
crown in any way and was punishable by the King‟s Council.  
In short, seditious libel was criticism of the crown.  It can be 
seen from the above statement that convictions for seditious 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
10 
 
libel ran into hundreds in the Great Britain.  At a later time, 
Criminal Libel Act, 1819 was enacted and it was an offence 
at common law punishable with imprisonment to publish 
orally seditious words with a seditious intention or to publish 
matter containing anything capable of being libel with a 
seditious intention.  The following statement from Halsbury‘s 
Laws of England (Fourth Edition) (Volume 11) captures the 
law relating to sedition in the United Kingdom: 
―828. Seditious words and seditious libel.  It is an offence 
at common law, punishable with imprisonment or fine at 
the discretion of the court, to publish orally seditious words 
with a seditious intention or to publish matter contained in 
anything capable of being a libel with a sedition intention.  
In the case of seditious libel there must be an incitement to 
disorder and violence.  Free comment, criticism and 
censure must, however, be distinguished from seditious 
words or seditious libel. 
 
A speech in either House of Parliament is 
privileged, but if the member afterwards publishes his 
speech it may constitute seditious libel.  The publication of 
seditious matter by a newspaper in a bona fide report of 
proceedings in a court of justice or in Parliament is 
privileged and the publisher is not liable.  It is uncertain 
whether the composition of a seditious writing with the 
intention that it should be published, but without actual 
publication, constitutes seditious libel.‖ 
 
13. 
It would be borne in mind that seditious libel is not an 
offence anymore and as such has been repealed in the United 
Kingdom.  The courts however extended the right of free 
speech even under the Criminal Libel Act, 1819.  For 
instance, in R v Sullivan and R v Pigott (1868) 11 Cox CC 44 
at 49, it was held that: 
―the freest public discussion, comment, criticism, and 
censure, either at meetings or in the press, in relation to all 
political or party questions, all public acts of the servants 
of the Crown, all acts of the government, and all 
proceedings of courts of justice are permissible, and no 
narrow construction is to be put upon the expressions used 
in such discussion etc., but the criticism and censure must 
be without malignity, and must not impute corrupt or 
malicious motives.‖ 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
11 
 
14. 
Similarly, in R v Collins (1839) 9 C & P 456 at 460, 
461, per Littledale J, it was stated that: 
―…every man has a right to give every public matter a 
candid, full and free discussion; something must be allowed 
for feeling in men‘s minds and for some warmth of 
expression, but an intention to incite the people to take the 
power into their own hands and to provoke them to tumult 
and disorder is a seditious intention…‖ 
15. 
Thus, the courts in U.K did not limit free speech and in 
particular political speech relating to matters of public interest 
and did not suppress the candid, full and free discussion and 
criticism in relation to all political or party questions and all 
public acts of the servants of the Crown and limited the 
offence to an intention to incite the people to take the power 
into their own hands and to provoke them to tumult and 
disorder which was held to constitute seditious intention.  
This was in sharp contrast to the construction section 124-A 
received at the hands of Judges in sub-continent during the 
pre-partition days.  They have been discussed in Kedar Nath 
Singh by the Indian Supreme Court.  For instance, in Queen 
Empress v Balagangadhar Tilak (1898) I.L.R 22 Bom. 112, 
the following statement of law defines the crime of sedition: 
―You will observe that the section places on absolutely the 
same footing the successful exciting of feelings of 
disaffection and the unsuccessful attempt to excite them, so 
that, if you find that either of the prisoners has tried to 
excite such feeling in others, you must convict him even if 
there is nothing to show that he succeeded. Again, it 
is important that you should fully realise another point. The 
offence consists in exciting or attempting to excite in others 
certain bad feeling towards the Government. It is not the 
exciting or attempting to excite mutiny or rebellion, or any 
sort of actual disturbance, great or small. Whether any 
disturbance or outbreak was caused by these articles, is 
absolutely immaterial. If the accused intended by the 
articles to excite rebellion or disturbance, his act would 
doubtless fall within section 134A, and would probably fall 
within other sections of the Penal Code. But even if he 
neither excited nor intended to excite any rebellion or 
outbreak or forcible resistance to the authority of the 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
12 
 
Government, still if he tried to excite feelings of enmity to 
the Government, that is sufficient to make him guilty under 
the section. I am aware that some distinguished persons 
have thought that there can be no offence against the 
section unless the accused either counsels or suggests 
rebellion or forcible resistance to the Government. In my 
opinion, that view is absolutely opposed to the express 
words of the section itself, which as plainly as possible 
makes the exciting or attempting to excite certain feelings, 
and not the inducing or attempting to induce to any course 
of action such as rebellion or forcible resistance, the test of 
guilt. I can only account for such a view by attributing it to 
a complete misreading of the explanation attached to the 
section, and to a misapplication of the explanation beyond 
its true scope." 
 
Thus, it was concluded that plainly, the exciting or 
attempting to excite certain feelings to the authority of the 
Government was sufficient to constitute the offence.  The 
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council did not dissent from 
the view and refused to grant leave to appeal.  It follows that 
section 124A is quintessentially a colonial law and has its 
genesis in the colonial rule.  It was enacted to perpetrate and 
entrench British rule in the sub-continent.  It has to be 
distinguished from other crimes which are commonly found 
to afflict a human society.  Sedition belongs to the species of 
offences which had no other purpose but suppression of 
people‟s voices by the colonial masters. 
16. 
In the historic days, in particular for seditious libel, the Jury 
decided whether the defendant had published the material and 
whether it carried the meaning charged by the government.  Judges 
decided whether the words were published with malice and had a 
bad tendency to damage the government, usually the two crucial 
points.  The defendant could not plead the truth of the words as a 
defence; indeed truth made the offence more severe because 
truthful charges would increase the public‟s disrespect for the 
crown.

Blackstone, an English jurist, was a major influence on 
English and American legal thinking in the period when the U.S 
Constitution was taking shape.  He made a distinction between 
liberty and licentiousness for which the punishment was 
considered legitimate.  The colonial experience which shaped the 
framing of the U.S Constitution has been summarized in the First 
Amendment by the authors in the following words: 
―Those who drafted and adopted the U.S. Constitution and the 
Bill of Rights were well aware of this history of repression in 
Great Britain. They also knew of, and had experienced, similar 
restrictions on freedom of expression that Britain had imposed 
on the colonies. 
Laws that applied to the press in England during the 17th and 
18th centuries were also applied to the emerging colonial press, 
and the licensing of presses in the colonies closely paralleled the 
English practice. Colonial printers were jailed, and their books 
burned, 
for 
publishing 
without 
permission. 
In 
1662, 
Massachusetts appointed censors. When Benjamin Harris 
printed the first edition of Publick Occurrences in 1690, it 
became the last edition of that newspaper; he had not gained 
prior approval. The colonies' second newspaper, the Boston 
News-Letter, published by John Campbell beginning in 1704, 
clearly informed its readers that it was printed with authority. 
After Parliament abolished licensing at the end of the 17th 
century, the colonial governors managed to retain it for several 
years more. Its decline in the colonies began in the early 1720s 
when James Franklin, Benjamin‘s brother, ignored an order to 
have his New England Courant licensed. He was briefly 
punished and once substituted his brother‘s name as publisher, 
but his refusal to obey the order brought licensing to a halt.  In 
both England and the colonies, the threat of punishment after the 
fact for matters the authorities deemed licentious continued even 
after licensing ended.  Contempt of the legislative branch was a 
real risk, and prosecutions for seditious libel occurred.‖ 
18. 
While the drafting of the U.S Constitution was taking 
place in 1721, the colonies first discovered the ardent views 
of Cato on freedom of speech in Benjamin Franklin‟s 
Pennsylvania Gazette.  Cato was the pseudonym of two 
journalists whose essays in London newspapers became 
popular and were widely reprinted in the colonies.  Cato 
described free speech as “the right of every man as far as by it 
he does not hurt or control the right of another”.  He said that 
“in those wretched countries where a man cannot call his 
tongue his own he can scarce call anything else his own”. 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
14 
 
19. 
It has been stated in the treaties, the First Amendment, 
that “the concept of natural law was actively discussed for 
two centuries before the Constitution was adopted.  In 
attempting to reconcile government‘s role with individual 
rights, certain personal freedoms were seen as inviolable.  
They were natural rights for individuals, rights that 
government officials or bodies had no power to affect.  
Among these rights was freedom of expression.‖   
20. 
The concept has been derived in large part from the 
work of 17th century English philosopher John Locke who 
contended that government‟s purpose was to use its power to 
protect life, liberty and property, natural rights to which each 
individual was entitled.  Locke‟s views influenced the 
language of the First Amendment of the U.S Constitution 
with the notion of free speech as a natural right.  Later, 
Professor Thomas I. Emerson in ―The System of Freedom of 
Expression‖ asserted that ―the system of freedom of 
expression in a democratic society” is based on four 
premises: 
1. freedom of expression facilitates self-fulfilment, 
2. it is an essential tool for advancing knowledge and 
discovering truth, 
3. it is a way to achieve a more stable and adaptable 
community, and 
4. it permits individuals to be involved in the democratic 
decision-making process. 
21. 
Individual rights have been named as one of the bases 
for freedom of expression by the authors in the First 
Amendment apart from the concept of market place of ideas 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
15 
 
and self-governance.  The seminal view that freedom of 
expression enhances the social good came from John Milton‟s 
Areopagitica in 1644.   Milton, an English poet and essayist 
wanted a divorce and wrote an essay he hoped would lower 
the strict prohibitions on divorce.  Perhaps Milton‟s most 
enduring contribution to the philosophy of freedom of 
expression was his statement that unrestricted debate would 
lead to the discovery of truth.  He stated that: 
(quoted by Craig R. Ducat in his Constitutional 
Interpretation, Ninth ed. Vol.II) 
Though all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play 
upon the earth, so Truth be in the field, we do injuriously, 
by licensing and prohibiting, to misdoubt her strength.  Let 
her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew the Truth put to 
the worse, in a free and open encounter?‖ 
 
Writing in England some fifty years later, John Locke 
reiterated some of this faith that truth would prevail.  In ―A 
Letter Concerning Toleration‖ (1689), he wrote: 
―Truth certainly would do well enough if she were once left 
to shift for herself.  She seldom has received, and I fear 
never will receive, much assistance from the power of great 
men, to whom she is but rarely known and more rarely 
welcome.  She is not taught by laws, nor has she any need 
of force to procure her entrance into the minds of men.  
Errors indeed prevail by the assistance of foreign and 
borrowed succors.  But if truth makes not her way into the 
understanding by her own light, she will be but the weaker 
for any borrowed force violence can add to her.‖ 
22. 
English philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill 
believed more in full and free discussion than did Milton. 
Mill in „On Liberty, contended that government could not 
prescribe opinions or determine what doctrines or what 
arguments people should hear: 
―The power itself is illegitimate.  The best government has 
no more title to it than the worst.  It is as noxious, or more 
noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, 
than when in opposition to it.  If all mankind minus one 
were of one opinion, and only one person were of the 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
16 
 
contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in 
silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, 
would be justified in silencing mankind….The peculiar evil 
of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is 
robbing the human race: posterity as well as the existing 
generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more 
than those who hold it.  If the opinion is right, they are 
deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if 
wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the 
clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, 
produced by its collision with error.‖ 
23. 
The concept of marketplace of ideas, first enunciated 
by Milton and later developed by Mill was recognized in 
American law by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in a dissent 
Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616 (1919).  Holmes 
wrote: 
―Persecution for the expression of opinions seems to me 
perfectly logical.  If you have no doubt of your premises or 
your power and want a certain result with all your heart 
you naturally express your wishes in law and sweep away 
all opposition.  To allow opposition by speech seems to 
indicate that you think the speech impotent, as when a man 
says that he has squared the circle, or that you do not care 
whole-heartedly for the result, or that you doubt either your 
power or your premises.  But when men have realized that 
time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to 
believe even more than they believe the very foundations of 
their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better 
reached by free trade in ideas—that the best test of truth is 
the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the 
competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground 
upon which their wishes safely can be carried out.  That at 
any rate is the theory of our Constitution.  It is an 
experiment, as all life is an experiment.‖ 
―vital of all general interests‖ was ―the dissemination of 
news from as many different sources, and with as many 
different facets and colors as is possible.  That interest is 
closely akin to, if indeed it is not the same as, the interest 
protected by the First Amendment; it presupposes that right 
conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a 
multitude of tongues, than through any kind of authoritative 
selection.  To many this is, and always will be, folly; but we 
have staked upon it our all.‖  United States v. Associated 
Press, 52 F.Supp. 362 (S.D.N.Y.1943), aff‘d 326 U.S. 
1(1945).‖ 
24. 
A third reason that freedom of communication is 
valuable in a democratic society according to the authors of 
the First Amendment is that such a society is based on self-

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
17 
 
governance, on an informed citizenry that will intelligently 
elect representatives.  James Madison (one of the founding 
fathers of United States) believed that the people not the 
government were sovereign and that the purpose of freedom 
of speech was to allow citizens to govern themselves in a free 
society.  This view also finds expression in the preamble of 
our Constitution where it is stated that: 
―Now, therefore, we, the people of Pakistan dedicated to 
the preservation of democracy achieved by the unremitting 
struggle of the people against oppression and tyranny‖.   
 
This statement is a clarion call by the people of 
Pakistan regarding their dedication to preservation of 
democracy which can only be achieved by raising voices 
against oppression and tyranny.  These voices cannot be 
suppressed or stifled by the provisions of section 124-A.  
25. 
In the treaties, the views of Professor Alexander 
Meiklejohn have also been referred which  bring out an 
important distinction with regard to self-governance and the 
right of free speech enacted through the First Amendment of 
the U.S constitution.  He advocated distinguishing between 
two kinds of expression.  Speech concerning the self-
governing process was political speech and deserved 
absolute 
protection 
from 
government 
interference.  
Speech that was non-political in character, private speech was 
protected only by the due process clause of the fifth 
amendment, which would permit the government some 
leeway for regulation.   
26. 
Perhaps the most powerful judicial statement of the 
justifications for free expression is that of Justice Brandeis, 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
18 
 
concurring in Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 375-77 
(1927): 
―Those who won our independence believed that the final 
end of the State was to make men free to develop their 
faculties; and that in its government the deliberative forces 
should prevail over the arbitrary. They valued liberty both 
as an end and as a means. They believed liberty to be the 
secret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty. 
They believed that freedom to think as you will and speak 
as you think are means indispensible to the discovery and 
spread of political truth; that without free speech and 
assembly discussion would be futile; that with them, 
discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against 
the dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest 
menace to freedom is an inert people; that public 
discussion is a political duty; and that this should be a 
fundamental principal of the American government. They 
recognize the risks to which all human institutions are 
subject. But they knew that order cannot be secured merely 
through fear of punishment for its infraction; that is 
hazardous to discourage thought, hope and imagination; 
that fear breeds repression; that repression breeds hate; 
that hate menaces stable government; that the path of 
safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed 
grievances and proposed remedies; and that the fitting 
remedy for evil counsels is good ones. Believing in the 
power of reason as applied through public discussion, they 
eschewed silence coerced by law--the argument of force in 
its worst form. Recognizing the occasional tyrannies of 
governing majorities, they amended the Constitution so that 
free speech and assembly should be granted.‖ 
27. 
In the opinion of Justice Brandeis, freedom to think as 
you will and speak as you think are means indispensable to 
the discovery and spread of political truth; that without free 
speech and assembly discussion would be futile.  The various 
expressions and bases for freedom of expression have been 
used to a greater or lesser extent by the courts around the 
civilized world to justify the high value placed on freedom of 
speech in the constitutional scheme of government.  Each 
may justify different notions of the breadth and depth of the 
freedom and each may apply with peculiar force in particular 
contexts.  In a nub, we cannot define freedom of speech as the 
freedom to say what is welcome to authority.

The Black‘s Law Dictionary (8th Edition) defines 
„sedition‟ as under: 
―a. 
Definition: Sedition has been defined as an 
agreement, communication, or other preliminary activity 
aimed at inciting treason or some lesser commotion against 
public authority. It is advocacy aimed at inciting or 
producing and likely to incite or produce imminent lawless 
action. 
29. 
The above definition is a traditional view of what 
constitutes the crime of sedition.  It is diametrically opposed 
in breadth to the criminal offence of sedition as defined in 
section 124-A.  In the above definition, the activity must be 
aimed at inciting treason or commotion against public 
authority.  Or it aimed at inciting imminent lawless action.  In 
the United States, the first Seditious Act was enacted in 1798 
and made it a crime punishable with fine and five years 
imprisonment: 
 ―if any person shall write, print, utter or publish …   any 
false, scandalous and malicious writing or writings against 
the government of the United States, or either house of the 
Congress . . ., or the President . . ., with intent to defame . . 
. or to bring them, or either of them, into contempt or 
disrepute; or to excite against them, or either or any of 
them, the hatred of the good people of the United State.‖ 
30. 
The Seditious Act 1798 allowed the defendant the 
defence of truth.  The Act was vigorously condemned as 
unconstitutional in an attack joined in by Jefferson and 
Madison.  The statute has since been repealed.  For 
jurisprudence regarding relaxation of the strict rules of 
seditious 
libel, 
the 
statement 
from 
the 
American 
Jurisprudence 2d, vol 70 may be referred: 
―On the subject of seditious libel, the modern tendency is 
toward a great relaxation of the strict rules which once 
prevailed, and there is substantial support for the view that 
an absolute privilege attaches to criticism of government 
and governmental systems. Similarly, the constitutional 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
20 
 
guarantee of free speech and press forbids criminal 
sanctions for truthful criticisms of public officials, and also 
protects false criticism, in the absence of malice or 
recklessness.‖ 
31. 
There is a rich body of case law on the First 
Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees 
freedom of speech and prohibits Congress from passing laws 
abridging speech, press, or peaceful assembly.  The subject 
has been treated extensively in Treaties on Constitutional 
Law Substance and Procedure (third edition) Ronald D. 
Rotunda and John E. Nowak.  The Treaties refers to the views 
of ancient Greek who widely believed that freedom of speech 
made their armies more brave.  It refers to a book by I.F. 
Stone, The Trial of Socrates (1985) and sets out the following 
quote from that book: 
During time of war, one of the first casualties is free 
speech, yet in ancient Athens, the cradle of democracy, the 
Greeks widely believed that freedom of speech made their 
armies  more brae.  Herodotus, in his history, writes that 
the Athenians could win victories over the more numerous 
Persians in the first part of the fifth century B.C. because 
the Athenians fought as free people, not as slaves.  ―Thus 
grew the power of Athens, and it is proved not by one but 
by many instances that equality is a good thing; seeing that 
while they were under despotic rulers the Athenians were 
no better in war than any of their neighbors, yet once they 
got quit of despots they were far and away the first of all,‖ 
because ―when they were freed each man was zealous to 
achieve for himself.,‖Aeschylus, in his play The Persians, 
similarly celebrates the victory of the Greeks because: ―Of 
no man are they the slaves or subjects.‖  As one 
commentator has perceptively noted, ―For Aeschylus, and 
for the Athenians, it was not just a victory of Greeks over 
Persians but of free men over ‗slaves.‘  The victors at 
Salamis were men elevated and inspired by the freedom to 
speak their minds and govern themselves.‖ 
Oftentimes we forget this ancient truth.  People who are 
free work more intensely because they work for 
themselves, not for a master.  It is for the same reason 
that it takes many hunting dogs to catch one fox: the fox 
works harder because he is self-employed.” 
32. 
The decision by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in 
Abrams case was extensively quoted in the Treaties and in 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
21 
 
particular the portion where Holmes conceded that laws 
regulating free speech be an effective way for the government 
to stifle opposition but maintained hope that people would 
realize that: 
―the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade 
in ideas—that the best test of truth is the power of thought 
to get itself accepted in the competition of the 
market…That…is the theory our Constitution.‖ 
 
Holmes warned against overzealous repression of 
unpopular ideas: 
―We should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check 
the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be 
fraught with death, unless they so imminently threaten 
immediate interference with the lawful and pressing 
purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to 
save the country.‖ 
33. 
Thus, the predominant view of the courts in the United 
States is that absolute privilege attaches to criticism of 
government and governmental system.  This has been 
entrenched by U.S Supreme Court and established as a sense 
of free expression in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan 376 U.S. 
254. That case not only brought major changes to the law of 
defamation but also enunciated law that has led to other 
changes in mass media law. 
The Trust Theory: 
34. 
That Pakistan is a „Republic‟ admits of no doubt.  The 
preamble of the Constitution declares that the state shall 
exercise its powers and authority through the chosen 
representatives of the people; The opening part of the 
preamble reads: 
―Whereas sovereignty over the entire Universe belongs to 
Almighty Allah alone, and the authority to be exercised by 
the people of Pakistan within the limits prescribed by Him 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
22 
 
is a sacred trust.‖ 
 
35. 
In the Constitution of the United States, the term 
sovereignty is totally unknown.  Yet it is long established that 
“it may be said, as a result, that both law-making and 
executive powers are conditionally conferred on those who 
hold public office, subject to the doctrine of trust which will 
be enforced by the courts in the name of the people‖.  
(Constitutional and Administrative Law by Hillarie Barnett, 
8th ed. p.154).  In the context of Pakistan, the difference is 
that since the sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to 
Almighty Allah alone, the people are His trustees, His 
delegates only. 
36. 
The trust theory received authoritative expression in 
Muhammad Yasin v. Federation (PLD 2012 SC 132) where it 
was held that: 
―Holders of public office have to remain conscious that in 
terms of the Constitution, it is the will of the people of 
Pakistan which has established the constitutional order 
under which they hold office. As such, they are first and 
foremost fiduciaries and trustees of the people of Pakistan. 
And, when performing the functions of their office, they can 
have no interest other than the interests of the honourable 
people of Pakistan in whose name they hold office and from 
whose pockets they draw their salaries and perquisites.  
37. 
 It was stated in Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani v. Assistant 
Registrar Supreme Court (PLD 2012 SC 466) that ―the 
functionaries of the state are fiduciaries of the people and 
ultimately responsible to the people who are also their pay 
masters‖. 
38. 
From the trust theory flows the right of the people of 
Pakistan to hold the trustee (persons holding positions in the 
Federal 
Government 
and 
Provincial 
Governments) 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
23 
 
accountable and this can be done either by the exercise of 
right of freedom of speech or will be enforced by the courts in 
the name of the people.  Any effort on censorship or to 
restrain normal expression will only free the Government of 
their limits which will then run amok.  The power being 
wielded by the holders of public office at any time has been 
committed or entrusted to them to be used in the interest of 
the people.  It is thus inconceivable for a fiduciary to gag and 
muzzle the delegator by making use of a provision which is 
archaic and is antithetical to the instincts and traditions of a 
people under a constitutional democracy.  A law which was 
the product of a colonial mindset must be subjected to a 
searching scrutiny and analysed punctiliously by placing it 
against the Constitution and to ask if it is disloyal to the 
language chosen by the framers of the Constitution.  The trust 
doctrine is one of the motifs of a liberal democracy and 
section 124-A, which is premised on fear and intimidation 
runs afoul of that doctrine. 
Reading the Constitution: 
39. 
While 
considering 
section 
124-A 
against 
the 
constitutional framework, the utterance of James Madison 
(architect of U.S Constitution) must inform our views (The 
Federalist Papers): 
―…if men were angels, no government would necessary.  If 
angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal 
controls on government would be necessary.  In framing a 
government which is to be administered by men over men, 
the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the 
government to control the governed; and in the next place 
oblige it to control itself.  A dependence on the people is, 
no doubt, the primary control on the government; but 
experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
24 
 
precautions…‖ 
 
40. 
In including the Bill of Rights in the Constitution, he 
became convinced that judicially enforceable rights are 
among the necessary auxillary precautions against tyranny.  
Since angels do not govern us, external controls on 
government are guaranteed by free expression of political 
speech. 
41. 
Laurence H. Tribe & Michael C. Dorf in the book „On 
Reading the Constitution‘, warn against two interpretative 
fallacies regarding Constitution.  Two ways, according to 
them, not to read the constitution is reading by dis-integration 
and reading by hyper-integration.  According to the authors, 
the salient fact is that it is a constitution,  and not merely an 
unconnected bunch of separate clauses and provisions with 
separate histories.  The authors noted that: 
―…It is a dis-integrated ―reading of the Constitution to lift 
one provision out, hold it up to the light, and give it its 
broadest possible interpretation, while ignoring the fact 
that it is immersed in a larger whole.‖ 
 
The Right under a Constitutional Democracy: 
42. 
A constitutional framework can be achieved by 
entrenching a set of norms in a constitutional document that 
sits above ordinary politics and is enforced by an institution 
different from the legislature.  There is an increasing legal 
discourse on the distinction between the activities of creating 
and applying the law which is now assumed to be one of the 
foundations of our existing legal practices.  Some institutions 
or bodies are tasked with creating legal rules for our societies 
and other institutions are instead chiefly tasked with applying 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
25 
 
those rules.  This gives rise to the concept of constitutional 
democracy.  The dependence of constitutional democracy, 
according to the authors of The Making of Constitutional 
Democracy (by Paolo Sandro and George Pavlakos) is on the 
distinction between creation and application of law.  They 
consider this to be the core element of the doctrine of modern 
constitutionalism.  The existence of this distinction between 
creation and application of law is not an original claim and is 
based on a rich body of scholarly works. 
43. 
The right to vote and freedom of expression are 
regarded as core democratic rights and both, therefore, 
qualify for elevated protection within a constitutional system.  
The free dissemination of ideas, facts and opinions enables 
the right to be exercised in an informed way.  Lord Nicholls 
(UK House of Lords) stated in Reynolds v. Times Newspapers 
[2001] 2 AC 127, 207, that: 
―At a pragmatic level, freedom to disseminate and receive 
information on political matters is essential to the proper 
functioning of the system of parliamentary democracy 
cherished in this country.  This freedom enables those who 
elect representatives to Parliament to make an informed 
choice, regarding individuals as well as policies, and those 
elected to make informed decisions.‖ 
 
44. 
In the book Common Law Constitutional Rights edited 
by Mark Elliott and Kirsty Hughes, it has been said that: 
―The precise role that voting plays in conferring 
democratic legitimacy to a system of government will vary 
according to different democratic theories.  However, for 
present purposes, it is enough to note that voting is a key 
component in any democratic system.  At its most basic, a 
system of representative government cannot describe itself 
as democratic if citizens do not have the means to choose 
the public officials that hold the ultimate decision-making 
power.  In most representative systems, that will be 
reflected in the election of members to the legislature. 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
26 
 
With freedom of expression, the right can be justified for 
many reasons, including those with no connection with 
democratic debate.  However, in the domestic and 
Strasbourg jurisprudence, the courts have justified the 
constitutional protection of the right in terms of its 
importance in a democracy.  The protection of expression 
is often taken to be what separates a democratic and non-
democratic regime”. 
 
45. 
Thus the right is of crucial importance in a 
constitutional democracy and the European Court of Human 
Rights regards it as separating a democratic from non-
democratic regime.  The authors went on to rely upon 
observations by Lord Bridge in Attorney General v 
Newspapers Ltd. (No.1) [1987] 1 WLR 1248, 1286: 
―Freedom of speech is always the first casualty under a 
totalitarian regime.  Such a regime cannot afford to allow 
the free circulation of information and ideas among its 
citizens.  Censorship is the indispensible tool to regulate 
what the public may and what they may not know.  ― 
46. 
The dominant view is that freedom of speech is valued 
for its services to a democratic society.  The book (at page 
116) articulates the cluster of cases in England on the 
importance of freedom of speech as a constitutional right in 
the following paragraph: 
―The courts recognized the importance of freedom of 
speech and freedom of the press on numerous occasions 
prior to the Human Rights Act, 1998.  In Broome v Cassell, 
the court referred to ‗a constitutional right to free speech‘.  
In Spycatcher, Lord Goff stated that ‗we may pride 
ourselves on the fact that freedom of speech has existed in 
this country perhaps as long as, if not longer than, it has 
existed in any other country in the world.  In Verrall, 
Watkins J described freedom of speech as ‗a fundamental 
freedom which this country has prided itself on 
maintaining, and for which much blood has been spilt over 
the centuries‘.  Such self-congratulatory statements 
possibly overlook the long history of censorship and 
control of publication (which helped to generate the 
various campaigns for free speech).  Notwithstanding this 
qualification, the common law has recognized the 
importance of free speech (even if it has not always secured 
strong protection).‖ 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
27 
 
47. 
Hugo Black (a U.S Supreme Court Justice) writing 
extra-curially in A Constitutional Faith (New York: Knopf, 
1968) at 45, said that: 
My view is, without deviation, without exception, without 
any if‘s, but‘s, or whereas, that freedom of speech means 
that government shall not do anything to people, or in the 
words of the megna carta, move against people, either for 
the view they have or the views they express on the words 
they speak or write.  Some people would have you believe 
that this is a very radical position, and may be it is.  But all 
I am doing is following what to me is the clear working of 
the First Amendment that ‗Congress shall make no 
law….abridging the freedom of speech or the press‘.   
48. 
In similar vein, Lord Hoffman (of the U.K House of 
Lords) writing in R v Secretary of State for the Home Deptt. 
Exp. Simons [2000] 2 A.C 115 said that: 
The principle is that: ―fundamental rights cannot be 
overridden by general or ambiguous words…In the 
absence of express language a necessary implication to the 
contrary the courts therefore presume that even the most 
general words were intended to be subject to the basic 
rights of the individual‖. 
It will be a rare case in which it could be hold that a 
fundamental right could be abolished or curtailed by 
necessary implication, and an even rarer case in which this 
could be held to have been authorized by subordinate 
legislation.‖ 
49. 
We live in a constitutional democracy with a limited 
Government.  The Constitution establishes the framework of 
government and enumerates fundamental rights upon people.  
Some of these rights, such as freedom of speech, are essential 
bulwarks against governmental overreach and excess of 
authority.  In Uncertain Justice, Lawrence Tribe (one of the 
leading constitutional experts) and Joshua Matz, said that: 
―Speech is powerful.  It is lifeblood of democracy, a 
precondition for the discovery of truth and vital to our self-
development.‖  Our constitutional tradition stands against the 
idea of Oceania‟s Ministry of Truth depicted in George 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
28 
 
Orwell‟s classic dystopian novel, 1984. These rights provide 
core elements to sustain constitutionalism, a concept 
described by Martin Loughlin in Against Constitutionalism, 
as: 
 ―…In modern understanding, a constitution is a 
consciously constructed artifact.  A constitution is a 
document adopted in the name of the people that defines 
the powers of government, specifies the basic rights of 
citizens, and regulates the relationships between the 
established institutions of government and their citizens.  
By extension, constitutionalism expresses the conviction 
that the exercise of political power in that regime must be 
subject to the disciplinary constraints imposed by that 
special text. 
―For constitutionalism to be accorded a clear meaning, it 
must be acknowledge as a purely modern concept.  
Constitutionalism did not exist before the idea that the 
basic terms of the governing relationship could be defined 
in a foundational document.  Searching for the intellectual 
origins of constitutionalism, scholars commonly arrive at 
the 
pioneering 
mid-eighteenth-century 
work 
of 
Montesquieu.  Again, this is an error.  While extolling the 
values of constitutional government, Montesquieu believed 
that no universal solution to the tension between order and 
liberty could be found.  Concluding that each regime must 
determine its own form of constitutional government, taking 
into account factors like climate, geography, economy, and 
political traditions, he maintained that the success of its 
constitution depended on the vibrancy of its political 
culture, or what he called ―the spirit of the laws‖.  
Montesquieu 
gives 
us 
a 
theory 
of 
relativity; 
constitutionalism, by contrast, is a universalist philosophy.  
The true foundational text of constitutionalism is James 
Madison, Elexander Hamilton, and John Jay‘s Federalist 
Papers, published in 1787. 
Constitutionalism, then, is a theory concerning the role, 
standing, appropriate institutional form, and telos of a 
purely modern invention: the documentary constitution.  
It maintains that the form of government established by 
the constitution rests its authority on two great pillars. 
The first pillar is that of representative government.  In 
Federalist 63, Madison explains that this principle 
requires “the total exclusive of the people in their 
collective capacity” from the business of governing and 
the delegation of that task to a small number of citizens 
elected by the rest.  “The people” are acknowledged as the 
authors of the constitution and the ultimate source of 
governmental authority.  But, as he notes in Federalist 
10, in order to “refine and enlarge the public views,” the 
actual tasks of governing must be entrusted to a 
representative body “whose wisdom may best discern the 
true intrest of their country and whose patriotism and love 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
29 
 
of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or 
partial considerations.” 
The second pillar requires the establishment of 
institutional mechanism for limiting, dividing, and 
balancing the powers of government.  This need for 
institutional differentiation is often presented as the 
doctrine of the separation of powers, a doctrine that 
Maurice Vile claims that “the most useful tool for the 
analysis of Western systems of Government” and “the 
most effective embodiment of the spirit which lies behind 
those systems.” 
50. 
According to the authors (and which view is based on 
modern concepts of constitutionalism and a tapestry of 
literature) “Government that had been legitimized by divine 
will or sacred custom are now opposed by a modern principle 
which authorized government by the consent of free and 
equal citizens.  “(Thomas Paine, Rights of Man).  He went on 
to conclude that conflict and dissent are constitutive features 
of democracy: 
―The written constitution performs a critical role in 
providing  a framework for institutionalizing such social 
conflicts. It is a medium through which people express their 
sense of the right, the good, and the just in ways that 
transcend particular interests. But the regime retains its 
democratic character only when, far from achieving 
reconciliation between basic principles, it holds them in a 
condition of indeterminacy. Democracy, notes Claude 
Lefort, is ―instituted and sustained by the dissolution of the 
markers of certainty.‖ 
Democracy persists through continuous and active 
political deliberation over the right and the good. Conflict 
and dissent are constitutive features that must be 
preserved, and they are preserved by ensuring that the 
meaning of these basic and contestable values remains 
the subject of continuous political negotiation through 
democratically 
constituted 
and 
democratically 
accountable processes.  
This feature of democracy places structural limitations on 
the degree to which it can be sublimated into 
constitutionalism. 
Once 
a 
political 
regime 
is 
conceptualized in the language of rights, lawyers too 
readily assume that it contains on overarching framework 
to be attended to by the judiciary, with legislative and 
administration activity  being reduced to mere regulative 
action that can be trumped by a claim of right. This 
overvalues the ability of the judiciary to reach political 
judgments on intensely contestable rights claims and 
undervalues the importance of the implicit rights judgments 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022

that 
legislatures 
and

make. 
The 
maintenance 
of 
institutional 
sites 
of 
democratic 
deliberation, decision-making, and accountability are 
essential makers of indeterminacy. They are essential 
preconditions for upholding Tocqueville‘s vision of 
political freedom.‖ 
Institutions for Protecting Constitutional Democracy IPDs: 
51. 
Closely tied in with the broad concept of constitutional 
democracy is the rise of Institutions for Protecting 
Constitutional Democracy (IPDs).  This is the subject of a 
book by Mark Tushnet, The New Fourth Branch, where IPDs 
have been labeled as the new fourth branch in the book by 
concluding that the Montesqueian enumeration of three and 
only three branches of government ―no longer identified the 
complete set of desiderata for institutional design‖.  Mark 
Tushnet (a Professor of Law Emeritus at Harvard Law 
School) refers to a novel concept contained in Chapter Nine 
of South Africa‟s Constitution, titled „State Institutions 
Protecting Constitutional Democracy‟.  He stated that: 
―Its list of institutions that strengthen constitutional 
democracy includes the public prosecutor, the Human 
Rights Commission, the auditor general and the Electoral 
Commission.  Seen in the context of the Constitution‘s 
written text, these institutions form a branch on a par with 
Parliament and the President‘. 
 
He relies upon Martin Laughlin‟s study of the 
“foundations of public law” and the discussion of the modern 
administrative state and what he calls “the rise of the 
ephorate”, a term drawn from the Greeks.  The ephors 
“constantly observe how state business is conducted” and 
“have the right to make enquiries wherever they can”.  
Crucially for Laughlin, the ephorate “must claim an original, 
rather than delegated authority, “which is the basis for 
treating it as a “new branch of government”.  The book‟s aim 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
31 
 
is to identify first the conceptual logic and then the functional 
logic underpinning IPDs: 
―Briefly: the conceptual underpinning is that the 
Montesqueian 
tradition 
cannot 
provide 
sufficient 
guarantees for constitutional democracy in a political 
world where political parties play central roles; the 
functional underpinning is that that difficulty is created by 
conflicts or convergences of interests in such a world.‖ 
 
52. 
In sum, our constitutional democracy enshrines 
fundamental rights which are conferred upon people and the 
most cherished of those rights is the right to freedom of 
speech and expression.  There cannot be an abridgement of 
speech unless it falls within the strict confines of the 
exceptions to Article 19 of the Constitution.  The doctrine of 
Trust and the role of the Government as a trustee, the 
structure of constitutional democracy and the new branch of 
IPDs conjointly bolster the greater need for free speech.  This 
is of the essence of rule of law and hews more closely to 
constitutionalism. There is little doubt that section 124-A is in 
significant tension with constitutionalism and constitutional 
democracy.  We cannot define freedom of speech as freedom 
to say what is welcome to authority.  This is precisely what 
section 124-A seeks to achieve. 
Article 19 and Section 124-A: 
53. 
Article 19 of the Constitution provides that: 
―19 
.Every citizen shall have the right to freedom of 
speech and expression, and there shall be freedom of the 
press, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by 
law in the interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, 
security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, friendly 
relations with foreign States, public order, decency or 
morality, or in relation to contempt of court, commission 
of] or incitement to an offence.‖ 
 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
32 
 
54. 
Section 124-A has to be squared against Article 19 to 
see if it is an abridgement of fundamental right of freedom of 
speech.  Section 124-A, at first blush, stitches together loose 
language to support the offence of sedition or seditious libel.  
It seems that the provision is intended to wreck revenge on a 
political dissenter so widely worded is the tenor of Section 
124-A.  ‗Revenge is a kind of wild justice which, the more 
Man‘s nature runs to, the more ought law to weed it out 
―(Francis Bacon, ‗Of Revenge‘) 
 
55. 
S.124A requires unpacking to establish that it 
contravenes Article 19. First and foremost, the offence, as 
couched, makes serious inroads into the right of freedom of 
speech and of the press. In a broadly worded provision which 
gives wide leeway to a Government, the offence restricts 
spoken and written words both by the people and the press. 
This impacts the people in a number of ways. On the one 
hand they are placed under threat of unstructured discretion of 
a police officer and on the other, they are enjoined to receive 
restrictive information at the whims of the Government. 
Thereby, the right granted by Article 19-A is also infringed. 
The right is qualified only to the extent of the interests 
mentioned in Articles 19. Otherwise the right is absolute. It 
will be noticed that right under Article 19A is subject to 
„reasonable restrictions imposed by law‟. This is distinct from 
Article 19 where the legislature cannot make just any law to 
restrict and constrain that right but can only do so “in the 
interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security or 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
33 
 
defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, friendly relations with 
foreign states, public order, decency or morality or in relation 
to contempt of court, commission of or incitement to an 
offence”. Thus the power to restrict free speech and freedom 
of press is circumscribed and hedged in by the fields of 
legislation specifically mentioned in Article 19 itself. Any 
law which seeks to suppress freedom of speech and press and 
does not falls strictly within one of the exceptions in Article 
19, falls afoul of it and is ultra vires to that extent.  
56. 
The first part of article 19 confers rights to freedom of 
speech and expression on every citizen. It further goes on to 
say that “there shall be freedom of the press”. This is a call by 
the Constitution on Federal and Provincial Governments to 
ensure the freedom of the press. The obligation thus placed is 
merely an extension of the original and primary right to free 
speech which has come to inhere in a citizen.  The whole 
purpose of providing for freedom of press is to enable 
democracy to flourish by keeping the citizenry informed and 
which will, in turn, feed into the entire democratic process 
through the right to vote.  Thus both, right to freedom of 
speech and freedom of press are inextricably linked to each to 
form a whole and constitute the main planks on which the 
edifice of democracy rests.  To what purpose is the freedom 
of speech if the press is not free. Conversely, to what purpose 
is the freedom of press if the citizens are not free to speak.  
An abridgment of any of these rights is abridgment of liberty 
and constitutional values.  It is the curtailment of natural 
rights.  For, without a free press, citizens will not be able to 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
34 
 
gather information to make informed decisions and to raise 
their voices against tyranny,  nepotism,   corruption etc. and 
other vices of like nature which the Governments are engaged 
in. Although freedom of press has been secured by the 
Constitution, it has been done for the benefit of citizens and 
to bolster their ability to participate fully and effectively in 
democratic process. It is not a right conferred independently 
on the press and media but is a necessary concomitant of the 
right to freedom of speech. The Constitution makers did not 
merely provide a right to freedom of speech and expression 
but added a further condition that the press shall be free so 
that the flow and transmission of information to the citizens 
may not be censored. Thomas Carlyle in „On Heroes and 
Hero-Worship (1841) quoted Edmund Burke, who said that 
―there were Three Estates in   Parliament; but in the 
Reporters Gallery yonder there sat a Fourth Estate more 
important far than they all.  It is not a figure of speech or 
witty saying; it is a literal fact—very momentous to us in 
these lines.‖   Without it the right cannot be enjoyed to its 
fullest extent and would remain truncated. Information and 
ideas feed into the decision making process while enriching 
the mental faculties. This, in turn strengthens the democratic 
polity and nurtures good governance.  
57. 
As if the enumeration in Article 19 was not enough, 
the right has been reinforced by the introduction of Article 
19A through Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010 
and provides that: 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
35 
 
―19A. Every citizen shall have the right to have access to 
information in all matters of public importance subject to 
regulation and reasonable restrictions imposed by law.‖ 
58. 
Article 19 and 19A have to be read together to form a 
seemless web. Right to freedom of speech is incomplete 
without freedom of press and which in turn, secures the right 
to have access to information in all matters of public 
importance. The Constitution guaranteed freedom of speech 
by Article 19 and lest its significance be lost, enacted Article 
19A to confer a right to have access to information in all 
matters of public importance.  It is incredulous to conceive 
that the constitutional mandate of free speech and freedom of 
press would still remain subservient to a colonial law enacted 
for a specific purpose to stifle speech.  The law was meant to 
place limits so that the primary purposes of servility and 
subjugation were achieved.  The purpose of law then, is an 
affront to constitutional rights now conferred.  Freedom from 
colonial rule was meant to usher in freedom of thought and it 
is impermissible for the citizens of Pakistan to be vilified and 
persecuted by allowing Section 124-A to remain part of our 
legal system.  These provisions in the Constitution are woven 
into a unified fabric and make a code unto itself. S.124-A 
seriously dents the right to publish freely by the press and to 
impart information through different platforms used by 
media. Any writings on political issues or discourse on 
matters of public importance may be caught by the mischief  
of S.124-A and would have the unpalatable effect of 
inhibiting free press.  

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
36 
 
59. 
There are three key words used in Section 124A: 
Contempt, hatred and disaffection. They are defined in 
Webster‟s Unabridged Dictionary (second edition) as: 
Contempt: 
―1. 
the feeling with which a person 
regards anything considered mean, vile, or worthless 
disdain; scorn. 2. the state of being despised; 
dishonor; disgrace. 
―CONTEMPT, DISDAIN, SCORN imply strong 
feelings of disapproval combined with disgust or 
derision.  CONTEMPT is disapproval tinged with 
disgust for what seems mean, base, or worthless. 
Hatred: 
―the feeling of one who hates, intense 
dislike or extreme aversion or hostility‖ 
Disaffection:  
―the absence or alienation of 
affection or goodwill: estrangement or disloyalty‖.‖ 
60. 
It is an offence to bring into hatred or contempt or 
excite disaffection towards the Federal or Provincial 
Government. From the definitions set out above, it is apparent 
that there is a wide margin of appreciation of these terms and 
it is entirely subjective for a construction to be put on them. 
Their degrees may also vary considerably but that may not 
matter ultimately since if it is encompassed in the term in the 
opinion of a decision maker, it is sufficient for an offence to 
be cognizable. For instance, contempt implies strong feelings 
of disapproval combined with disgust. Whether the feelings 
are strong enough to constitute an offence is for the person in 
authority to determine. At a given time and in a particular 
case those strong feelings of disapproval may go unnoticed 
yet in another case and under different circumstances, lesser 
feelings of disapproval would be enough to attract the 
offence. In the ultimate analysis the decision to prosecute 
depends on who wield the authority. 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
37 
 
61. 
Similarly „disinfection‟ is absence of affection or 
goodwill. It is inconceivable that such a mild sentiment will 
attract an offence. There is virtually no affection amongst 
political opponents and so anything they utter will attract 
section 124-A in its present form. We have seen that in the 
political arena feelings of enmity run deep in a number of 
cases.  They have nothing but disdain and utter disregard for 
the others‟ views.  This can be gleaned from speeches made 
by politicians in public rallies, where, in the heat of 
sentiments they utter words full of contempt, hatred and 
disaffection for their opponents who happen to occupy high 
offices of Federal or Provincial Government.  Taken in its 
present form, S. 124-A demands allegiance and loyalty by all 
opposition parties and their members by the citizens and 
members of the press towards the Federal or Provincial 
Governments of the day.  By Explanation 1, disloyalty and 
feelings of enmity have also been included in the expression 
disaffection.    This means that any political opponents or a 
citizen holding loyalty to a different political group will be 
committing an offence by doing so. He will, by necessary 
implication, be disloyal to the Federal or Provincial 
Government in power. This is antithetical to the very concept 
of democracy and constitutionalism. This also implies that at 
any particular moment, nearly half of the population will be 
guilty of the offence of seditious libel, en banc. Loyalty to the 
state has to be distinguished from loyalty to the Federal 
Government whose offices are being occupied by a political 
party. Not everyone will have doctrinal affinity with a 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
38 
 
political party and must be free to express feelings of 
disaffection and estrangement towards its policies and 
programmes. Explanations 2 & 3 of section 124-A are  
attempts to water-down the harshness of that provision but it 
still does not make the provision constitutional. These 
explanations were added later on by amending the original 
section 124-A .  To reiterate, the Explanations do not dilute 
the offence in any manner but merely afford a defence to a 
citizen charged with the offence of sedition.  If so charged, 
the accused will have the burden to prove that his case falls in 
Explanation 2 or 3 and that he was expressing disapprobation 
without exciting hatred or contempt.  And so the basic 
ingredient of exciting or attempting to excite hatred, contempt 
or disaffection which constitutes the offence of sedition stays 
intact.  This, then is the foundational question: why should a 
citizen or a member of press be charged with sedition for 
expressing hatred, contempt or disaffection towards a Federal 
or Provincial Government? As human beings we are all 
susceptible to showing such emotions at some point or the 
other and to curb them is to make robots out of the citizens of 
Pakistan.  The people of this country are the masters and the 
holders of offices of the Government are the public servants.  
This situation cannot be rendered topsy-turvy by arming the 
public servants with the power to stifle the masters.  Section 
124-A connotes a stark regression in the protection of right 
guaranteed by Article 19 and must yield in its favour. Section 
124-A is incompatible with the foundational principles of 
constitutional democracy and as a relic of past, must be 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
39 
 
consigned to oblivion. It has no place in a society which 
relishes new ideas and critical analysis to advance itself.  The 
prohibition of mere criticism of Government that does not 
invite violence reflects an antiquated view of the relationship 
between the state and society.  According to E. Barendt in 
Freedom of Speech (2nd ed. 2005) at 163, ―according to this 
view, the ruler is the superior of the subject and as such is 
entitled to be shielded from criticism or censure likely to 
diminish his or her status or authority.‖  
62. 
Fundamental rights including the right of freedom of 
speech and press were guaranteed for the first time by the 
1956 Constitution.  Before that the government had absolute 
authority to restrict the freedom of speech and expression by 
securing legislation to enable it to act in any manner it 
considered expedient.  It was held in Begum Zeb un Nisa v. 
Pakistan (PLD 1958 SC (Pak) 35, 39) that “after the 
Constitution, however, these powers no longer exist and 
neither the legislature nor the government can impose any 
restriction on freedom of speech and expression except for the 
purposes mentioned in Article 19”.  In that case section 12 of 
the Security of Pakistan Act, 1952 was held to be in conflict 
with Article 8 of the 1956 Constitution which guaranteed 
freedom of speech and expression. 
63. 
The case for freedom of speech as fundamental right 
has rarely been made as effectively as Professor Thomas 
Emerson has made it in his “The System of Freedom of 
Expression”: 
―First, freedom of expression is essential as a means of assuring 
individual self-fulfilment. The proper end of man is the 
realization of his character and potentialities as a human being. 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
40 
 
For the achievement of this self-realization the mind must be 
free. Hence suppression of belief, opinion, or other expression is 
an affront to the dignity of man, a negation of man‘s essential 
nature. Moreover, man in his capacity as a member of society 
has a right to share in the common decisions that affect him. To 
cut off his search for truth, or his expression of it, is to elevate 
society and the state to despotic command over him and to place 
him under the arbitrary control of others.  
Second, freedom of expression is an essential process for 
advancing knowledge and discovering truth. An individual who 
seeks knowledge and truth must hear all sides of the question, 
consider all alternatives, rest his judgment by exposing it to 
opposition, and make full use of different minds. Discussion must 
be kept open no matter how certainly true an accepted opinion 
may seem to be; many of the most widely acknowledged truths 
have turned out to be erroneous. Conversely, the same principle 
applies no matter how false or pernicious the new opinion 
appears to be; for the unaccepted opinion compel a rethinking 
and retesting of the accepted opinion. The reasons which make 
open discussion essential for an intelligent individual judgment 
likewise make it imperative for rational social judgment. 
Third, freedom of expression is essential to provide for 
participation in decision making by all members of society. This 
is particularly significant for political decisions. Once one 
accepts the premise of the Declaration of Independence – that 
governments ―derive their just powers from the consent of the 
governed‖ – it follows that the governed must, in order to 
exercise their right of consent, have full freedom of expression 
both in forming individual judgments and in forming the 
common judgment. The principle also carries beyond the 
political realm. It embraces the right to participate in the 
building of the whole culture, and includes freedom of 
expression in the religion, literature, art, science, and all areas 
of human learning and knowledge. 
Finally, freedom of expression is a method of achieving a more 
adaptable and hence a more stable community, of maintaining 
the precarious balance between healthy cleavage and necessary 
consensus. This follows because suppression of discussion makes 
a rational judgment impossible, substituting force for reason; 
because suppression promotes inflexibility and stultification, 
preventing society from adjusting to changing circumstances or 
developing new ideas; and because suppression conceals the 
real problems confronting society, diverting public attention 
from the critical issues. At the same time the process of open 
discussion promotes greater cohesion in a society because 
people are more ready to accept decisions that go against them 
if they have a part in the decision making process. Moreover, the 
State at all times retains adequate powers to promote unity and 
to suppress resort to force. Freedom of expression thus provides 
a framework in which the conflict necessary to the progress of a 
society can take place without destroying the society. It is an 
essential mechanism for maintaining the balance between 
stability change.‖ 
64. 
It was said by Justice Holmes in United States v. 
Schwimmer, (1929) 279 US 644 that nothing in the 
Constitution was more scared than “the principles of free 
thought—not free thought for those who agree with us but 
freedom for the thought that we hate”.  

W.P. No.59599 of 2022

65. 
Article 10 of the European Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1958 
provides: 
―1. 
Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. 
This right shall include the freedom to hold opinions and to 
receive and impart information and ideas without 
interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. 
This Article shall not prevent states from requiring the 
licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.  
2. 
The exercise of these freedom, since it carries with 
it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such 
formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are 
prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic 
society, in the interest of national security, territorial 
integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or 
crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the 
protection of the reputation or rights of others, for 
preventing the disclosure of information received in 
confidence, or for maintaining the authority and 
impartiality of the judiciary.‖ 
66. 
Article 10 received an authoritative pronouncement by 
the European Court of human rights in Yankov v. Bulgaria, 15 
BHRC 592 as follows: 
i. 
Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential 
foundation of a democratic society and one of the basic 
conditions for its progress and for each individual‘s self-
fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is 
applicable not only to ―information‖ or ―ideas‖ that are 
favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a 
matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock 
or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, 
tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is not 
―democratic society‖. As set forth in Article 10, this 
freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be 
construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions which 
must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any 
restrictions must be established convincingly.  
 
ii. 
That adjective ―necessary‖, within the meaning of Article 
10(2), implies the existence of a ‗pressing social need‖, the 
Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in 
assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in 
hand with European supervision, embracing both the 
legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given 
by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered 
to give the final ruling on whether a ―restriction‖ is 
reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by 
Article 10. 
 
iii. 
In exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, the Court must 
look at the interference in the light   of the case as a whole, 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
42 
 
including the content of the impugned statements and the 
context in which they were made. In particular, it must 
determine whether the interference in issue was particular, 
it must determine whether the interference in issue was 
―proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued‖ and 
whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to 
justify it are ―relevant and sufficient‖. In doing so, the 
Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities 
applied standards which were in conformity with the 
principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they 
based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the 
relevant facts.  
 
iv. 
In a democratic society individuals are entitled to comment 
on and criticise the administration of justice and the 
officials involved in it. Limits of acceptable criticism in 
respect of civil servants exercising their powers may 
admittedly in some circumstances be wider than in relation 
to private individuals. However, it cannot be said that civil 
servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of 
their every word and deed to the extent to which politicians 
do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with 
the later when it comes to the criticism of their actions. 
Moreover, civil servants must enjoy public confidence in 
conditions free of undue perturbation if they are to be 
successful in performing their tasks and it may therefore 
prove necessary to protect them from offensive, abusive or 
defamatory attacks when on duty.‖ 
67. 
Relying upon Article 10 of the European Convention, 
it was noted by Lord Steyn in R (Rusbridger) v. A.G (2003 4 
All ER 784 that “freedom of political speech is a core value of 
our legal system.  Without it the rule of law cannot be 
maintained”.  It will be noted that section 124-A is a species 
of political speech which is sought to be curbed.  Thus, it is 
abridgment of political speech which is discountenanced by 
all liberal democracies based on constitutionalism and which 
makes such freedom as the very basis of rule of law and one 
of the core values of any legal system.  In the celebrated case 
of New York Times v. Sullivan (1964) 376 US 254, the 
reliance was placed on the classic formation made by Justice 
Brandeis in Whitney v. California (1927) 274 US 357. 
68. 
From the right to freedom of speech flows the right to 
freedom of press which are generally the same.  In the context 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
43 
 
of freedom of press, in All Pakistan Newspapers Association 
v. Federation (PLD 2012 SC 1) the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan quoted from the Indian decision in AIR 1986 SC 515 
on the freedom of press, namely, that: 
―in today‘s free world, freedom of press is the heart of 
social and political intercourse. The press has now 
assumed the role of public educator making formal and 
non-formal education possible in large scale particularly in 
the developing world where television and other kinds of 
modern communication are not still available for all 
sections of society. The purpose of the press is to advance 
the public interest by publishing facts and opinions without 
which a democratic electorate cannot make responsible 
judgments. Newspapers being surveyors of news and view 
having a bearing on public administration very often carry 
material which would not be palatable to governments and 
other authorities‖‖ 
69. 
It is undisputed that the offence of sedition could also 
be used against the press, its editors etc.  This infringes the 
right of a free press to publish freely what is necessary to do 
so in order to inform the general public which has a right to 
know and be informed of the different issues in order to make 
a more informed decision regarding political matters.  The 
existence of free press therefore is an essential element in a 
constitutional democracy and rule of law.  There is no doubt 
that in a democracy the majority can participate indirectly 
exercising their right as citizens to vote, express opinions and 
make representations to the authorities and form pressure 
groups and so on.  They cannot do so unless they are alerted 
to and informed about matters which call for consideration 
and action.  It is largely through the media including the press 
that they will be so alerted and informed.  It has been held 
that the proper functioning of a modern participatory 
democracy requires the media to be free, active, professional 
and enquiring.  The only limitation that can be placed on a 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
44 
 
free press is one enumerated as exceptions to Article 19 of the 
Constitution and must be proportionate and no more than is 
necessary to promote the legitimate object of the restriction.  
The offence of sedition in section 124-A travels beyond the 
limitation placed by Article 19 regarding role of press and its 
freedoms which must not be abridged on the misplaced notion 
that the government of the day can suppress political speech 
at will.  The significance of free press was recognized by 
Donaldson M.R. in A.G. v. Guardian (No.2) (1988) 3 All ER 
545, 600 where it was held that: 
―The existence of a free press is an essential element in 
maintaining parliamentary democracy.  But it is important 
to remember why the press occupies this crucial position.  
It is not because of any special wisdom, interest or status 
enjoyed by proprietors, editors or journalists.  It is because 
the media are the eyes and ears of the general public.  They 
act on behalf of the general public.  Their right to know 
and their right to publish is neither more nor less than that 
of the general public.  Indeed it is that of the general public 
for whom they are trustees.   If the public interest in the 
safety of the realm or other public interest requires that

This duty is owed to the public as much as to the confider.‖ 
70. 
Thus, if section 124-A were allowed to stand in its 
present form, the media and the press would also be caught 
by its mischief and contrary to its role of informing the 
general public regarding issues of a political nature will be 
shackled by its ability to do so by the provisions of section 
124-A which would pose a constant threat to a free press to 
write freely and to dispense information without any fear of 
prosecution.  In a true constitutional democracy the media 
and the press owe a duty to the public for dissemination of 
information.  That duty is thrown into jeopardy by the 
provisions of section 124-A.

Article 19 expressly provides that the right of freedom 
of speech and expression are subject to reasonable restrictions 
imposed by law and enumerated in Article 19 itself.  It 
permits restrictions to be imposed by law to save the interests 
expressly mentioned therein and one consequence of making 
rights subject to restrictions is that restrictions can be imposed 
to protect only those interests as are expressly mentioned and 
none other.  It follows indubitably that the restrictions must 
have nexus with one of the expressly mentioned interests and 
none else.  Cases abound where the superior courts have held 
that if a restriction did not cover the expressly mentioned 
interests, 
then 
that 
restriction 
offended 
against 
the 
Constitution and was ultra vires.  It was held in Reynolds v. 
Times Newspaper (1999) 4 All ER 609, 628-9 that freedom of 
expression was the rule and regulation of speech is an 
exception requiring justification.  The same rule of 
interpretation must inform us while putting a construction on 
Article 19 since the landscape provided by Article 19 in the 
words of Lord Steyn in Reynolds is ―a great importance 
inasmuch as it provides the taxonomy against which the 
question must be considered.  The starting point is now the 
right of freedom of expression, a right based on a 
constitutional or higher legal order foundation.  Exceptions 
to freedom of expression must be justified as being necessary 
in a democracy.  In other words, freedom of expression is the 
rule and regulation of speech is the exception requiring 
justification.  The existence and width of any exception can 
only be justified if it is underpinned by a pressing social need.

These re fundamental principles governing to balance to be 
struck between freedom of expression and defamation‖.  
72. 
We are not here called upon to interpret the exceptions 
mentioned in Article 19.  It would suffice for our purposes to 
note that the offence of sedition enacted through section 124-
A is not comprised in any of the exceptions mentioned in 
Article 19.  Further section 124-A abridges and limits 
political speech which cannot be countenanced in a free 
constitutional democracy with freedom of speech and press as 
the core values.  Another aspect which will be noted is that by 
Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1975, Article 19 was 
amended and the word “defamation” was omitted.  The 
wrong of defamation is a private wrong and Article 19 is 
directed against the state as also section 124-A seeks to curb 
any criticism of the Federal and Provincial Government 
which makes it a public wrong.

Six years ago, in Packingham v North Carolina the 
U.S Supreme Court struck down a law that prohibited 
convicted offenders from using social media, reasoning that 
these websites had become „integrated to the fabric of our 
modern society and culture‟.   
74. 
A half century before that, the U.S Supreme Court 
decided a series of cases recognizing that the First 
Amendment protects not only the right to speak but also the 
right to receive information and ideas from abroad.  In one of 
those cases, Lamont v Postmaster General 381 U.S 301 
(1965), the court invalidated a federal law that barred 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022

Americans from receiving “communist political propaganda” 
from foreign countries.  The court held that the law was an 
impermissible attempt „to control the flow of ideas to the 
public”. 
75. 
The offence of sedition and seditious libel is a relic of 
autocracies and colonial subjugation.  It is time that it finds its 
permanent resting place and suffers a condemnation that it 
deserves.  We live under a constitution which espouses a 
system of constitutional democracy embellished with 
fundamental human rights.  Section 124-A in its current form, 
cannot stand the critical interrogation of our Constitution and 
its ethos.  It is time to move on and strengthen the law of 
defamation to counter malicious speech and outrageous 
slander.  This will serve as a deterrence and help vindicate a 
person‟s sullied reputation if the speech or writing does not 
pursue a legitimate aim.  In the deathless lines of Allama 
Iqbal: 
جہان تاز
ہ کی افکا ر تازہ سے ہے نمود  
کہ سنگ و خشت سے ہوتے نہیں جہاں پیدا

Before I tear myself away, a reference may be made to 
the new battle over constitutional interpretation in the United 
States. It promotes interpretation based on common-good of 
the people. There is a renewed debate among legal and 
political commentators as to the best method to interpret the 
Constitution. More recently, however, drawing on the classic 
legal and natural law tradition, and arguments developed in 
his extensive work on administrative and constitutional law 

W.P. No.59599 of 2022 
48 
 
the prominent law scholar Adrian Vermeule argued in a series 
of recent essays (now in the form of a book Common-Good 
Constitutionalism)  that the time has come for legal 
conservatives to set originalism aside.  In its stead, Vermeule 
argues that conservatives should approach constitutional 
interpretation in an openly morally-infused way and should 
be sanguine about using state power to promote the common-
good—an approach to constitutionalism Vermeule dubs 
“common-good constitutionalism”.  Vermeule‟s proposal 
immediately sparked heated responses and it was welcomed 
as a much needed reminder that legal interpretation cannot be 
severed from questions of political morality and a conception 
of the ultimate purpose of constitutional government. 
77. 
In conclusion it is held that: 
 Section 124-A, PPC is unconstitutional and offends the 
fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 19 and 19A of 
the Constitution. 
 Since section 124-A is inconsistent with and in 
derogation of fundamental rights, it is held to be void 
as a whole.  It is hereby struck down. 
Petition allowed.
