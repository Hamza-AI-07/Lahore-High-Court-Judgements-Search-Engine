      Anwaar Hussain, J.   Through this single judgment, the present 
as well as the connected constitutional petition bearing W.P. No.7222 of 
2021 are being simultaneously decided, as common questions of law and 
fact are involved, which are intrinsically intertwined, and the finding in 
the present petition effects the outcome of the connected case. 
2. By way of factual background, it has been noted that the petitioner 
was appointed, on a contract basis for a period of three years, on 
12.09.2018, as Assistant Director Agriculture (OFWM), through the 
Punjab Public Service Commission. One of the essential conditions of 
appointment related to the requirement of five years’ experience in the 
field of Water Management. On 26.11.2019, the petitioner’s services 
were terminated on the allegation that he had furnished a bogus 
experience certificate. The said termination order is under challenge in 

W.P. No.9729 of 2019 
                                                            
 
           - 2 - 
 
the present constitutional petition. Operation of the termination order was 
suspended by this Court, on 12.12.2019, whereafter the petitioner 
continued performing his duties. During the pendency of the proceedings 
before this Court, in present petition, the petitioner sought regularization 
of his service in accordance with law and, for that purpose, filed the 
connected petition bearing W.P. No.7222 of 2021. Through order dated 
13.09.2021, passed in connected case, the respondents were directed by 
this Court to consider case of the petitioner for regularization, and the 
respondents accordingly regularized the petitioner’s service, through 
order dated 17.12.2021, subject to the outcome of the proceedings 
pending before this Court. The petitioner thereafter continued working as 
a regular employee. On 10.12.2024, when arguments were not 
advanced by the petitioner’s side, in compliance with the direction of this 
Court, both petitions were dismissed for non-compliance. The petitioner 
preferred Intra-Court Appeal bearing No.151 of 2024, which was allowed 
on 24.12.2024 and one more opportunity was granted to him to argue the 
cases. Meanwhile, on 16.12.2024—well within the limitation period for 
filing an Intra-Court appeal—the petitioner was relieved from service by 
the Deputy Director Agriculture (On-Farm Water Management), Vehari. 
It is an admitted position that since that date the petitioner has remained 
out of service. 
3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submit that during the pendency of 
this petition, this Court vide order dated 08.05.2025 directed the 
Secretary Agriculture Department to verify the disputed experience 
certificate(s) of the petitioner and the verification report dated 07.07.2025 
has been placed on record, which confirms that the certificate(s) issued to 
the petitioner including one by M/s. Haji Sons International were 
genuine. 
4. Conversely, 
learned 
Law 
Officer, 
alongwith 
departmental 
representative, argues that the experience required under the 

W.P. No.9729 of 2019 
                                                            
 
           - 3 - 
 
advertisement was for service of a candidate as a regular employee, 
whereas M/s. Haji Sons International has certified that the petitioner 
worked on daily-wage basis, through a third party, which (third party) 
was not registered with SECP, Registrar of Firms, or any other regulatory 
authority as contemplated by the advertisement. On a pointed question by 
this Court, no other infirmity in the petitioner’s appointment has been 
referred or pressed by the departmental representative or the learned Law 
Officer.  
5. Arguments heard. Record perused. 
6. The core issue is narrow: (i) whether the petitioner’s experience 
certificate issued by M/s Haji Sons International was genuinely issued 
and, if so, (ii) whether the nature of his engagement as a daily-
wage/project-based worker, with the employer, renders such experience 
non-qualifying.  
7. 
Adverting to the first question formulated hereinabove, the 
petitioner submitted experience letter dated 04.06.2017 issued by M/s. 
Haji Sons International and through letter dated 23.10.2018, it was 
declared that the same is not verified and fake, whereafter the petitioner 
again submitted experience letter dated 28.12.2021, which reads as 
under: 
 
“It is stated that Mr. Aamir Shabbir has been working 
with field manager of our organization during 01-04-2015 to 
31-03-2017, in few projects. Area manager engaged 
engineering staff locally to complete their local assignment 
and he paid them commission/like daily wages. Therefore, his 
record/information was not available in our head office at the 
time of experience verification. Mr. Muhammad Aamir 
Shabbir was engaged with Area managers of our organization 
in above said tenure.” 
 
Letter dated 28.12.2021 clarifies as to why, upon the initial 
verification, petitioner’s earlier experience letter was declared as 
unverified/fake. Letter dated 28.12.2021 was further verified upon the 

W.P. No.9729 of 2019 
                                                            
 
           - 4 - 
 
direction of this Court by M/s. Haji Sons International, through the 
administrative department, vide letter dated 13.06.2025 that reads as 
under: 
“With reference to your letter No.11059/DGA/WM/2-1141-
Estt, dated 10.06.2025, regarding the experience verification 
of Mr. Aamir Shabbir, S/O Muhammad Shabbir Ahmed, we 
hereby confirm that he was employed under the supervision 
of our Managers. 
 
Mr. Aamir Shabbir worked with us on various 
projects under the domain of our Area Manager during the 
period from 01 April 2015 to 31 March 2017. A copy of the 
previously issued experience letter is enclosed for your 
reference.” 
In view of the above, this Court is of the opinion that the experience 
certificate of the petitioner, issued by M/s. Haji Sons International was 
genuine, which takes this Court to the nub of the matter that is condensed 
as issue No.ii as to whether the said experience certificate on daily wage-
based/project based satisfied the eligibility requirement of the 
advertisement.  
8. 
Before examining this issue, it is appropriate to reproduce the 
relevant experience requirement as set out in the advertisement: 
“MINIMUM QUALIFICATION/EXPERIENCE 
M.Sc. (Hons) Agriculture 
OR 
B.Sc. (Mechanical Engineering) (2nd Division) from a 
recognized University. 
05 years’ Experience in the field of Water Management. 
Note: (i) Only Practical/Administrative Experience 
shall be considered. (ii) Experience in private entities 
shall be accepted if such entity is registered with 
SECP, Registrar of Firms or any other Regulatory 
Authority.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
The above requirement qua experience nowhere stipulates that the 
candidate must have served under the direct control of the private entity, 

W.P. No.9729 of 2019 
                                                            
 
           - 5 - 
 
issuing the certificate, or that such service must necessarily be on regular 
or permanent basis. The only explicit condition is that where experience 
is claimed from a private entity, that entity must be duly registered with 
the SECP, the Registrar of Firms, or any other relevant authority. In the 
present case, the departmental representative acknowledged that M/s. 
Haji Sons International is registered with the Registrar of Firms. The 
dispute/problem qua verification stemmed solely from the fact that the 
petitioner had worked in project-based role, in local assignment, rather 
than in the head office of M/s Haji Sons International and the experience 
certificate issued earlier was not verified for the said reason. The 
petitioner’s former employer (M/s Haji Sons International) has affirmed 
that he indeed worked with them.  
9. When specifically queried, learned Law Officer reiterated that the 
impugned termination of the petitioner was based on the alleged falsity of 
the certificate—an allegation now negated by the official verification 
report albeit averred that experience as daily wager is not relevant and 
the petitioner was not eligible for the post. This Court holds that the 
department’s interpretation of experience is legally flawed and that the 
petitioner’s termination was unjustified. Learned Law Officer as well as 
departmental representative could not demonstrate any legal provision— 
statutory, regulatory, or otherwise—that excludes daily-wage or 
contractual and project based employment/service from being treated as 
“experience” for the purposes of eligibility. Such an exclusion would 
constitute an unreasonable classification, unjustly depriving candidates of 
legitimate professional opportunity despite performing actual work in the 
field of Water Management, which is not the true object of the 
experience criterion, in the present case. It is imperative to hold that any 
exclusion, which deprives a citizen of consideration for public 
employment must have a clear foundation in law. Where the 
advertisement stipulates five years’ experience—even from private 

W.P. No.9729 of 2019 
                                                            
 
           - 6 - 
 
entities registered with SECP or a relevant regulatory body—the later 
insistence that such experience must be on a regular, rather than contract 
or daily-wage basis, is wholly untenable when neither the law (statute, 
the rules, the recruitment policy), nor the advertisement prescribe such a 
bar. Introducing an impediment in respect of eligibility of a post not 
expressly provided amounts to reading into the criteria what the law or 
the advertisement does not contain, thereby infringing the constitutional 
right of the petitioner to seek employment. Permitting arbitrary exclusion 
at the discretion of the authority is not sanctioned by the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
10. Turning to the termination of the employment during the pendency 
of the case, it is imperative to note that the petitioner was duly qualified, 
appointed on merit, completed his contractual term, and continued in 
service during the litigation and was regularized subject to outcome of 
the present petitions. These constitutional petitions were dismissed on 
10.12.2024 for non-compliance of direction of this Court to learned 
counsel for the petitioner to advance arguments or make alternate 
arrangement. A statutory remedy of Intra-Court Appeal, with a limitation 
of twenty days, was available to the petitioner. Rather than allowing the 
limitation period to run its course, before taking an adverse action, the 
petitioner was relieved from service on 16.12.2024—just six days after 
the dismissal of the petitions, effectively frustrating his substantive right 
of appeal and that too by an officer [Deputy Director Agriculture 
(OFWM), Vehari] who is admittedly not the competent authority as the 
departmental representative before this Court acknowledges that it is 
Administrative Secretary (Secretary Agriculture) who had the power to 
terminate the petitioner. On Court’s query, learned counsel for the 
petitioner, on instructions, undertook that the petitioner will not claim 
back benefits or arrears for the intervening period in the event of his 
reinstatement. 

W.P. No.9729 of 2019 
                                                            
 
           - 7 - 
 
11. The right of appeal is a substantive and valuable right of a litigant. 
Administrative action that defeat such a right—particularly by 
implementing adverse orders before expiry of the limitation period—
cannot sustain. The respondents were obligated to act fairly, but instead 
acted precipitously in a manner incompatible with principles of natural 
justice and the administrative propriety and an officer who was not 
competent to terminate the services of the petitioner issued the relieving 
order dated 16.12.2024, which is not sustainable.  
12. In view of the above discussion, the present as well as the 
connected petition bearing W.P. No.7222 of 2021 are allowed. The 
impugned termination order dated 26.11.2019 as well as relieving order 
dated 16.12.2024 is hereby set aside. The petitioner’s regularization, 
earlier granted subject to outcome of these proceedings, is declared valid 
and lawful. The respondents are directed to reinstate the petitioner in 
service within seven (07) working days from the date of presentation of a 
certified copy of this judgment. The intervening period shall be treated as 
leave without pay, in accordance with the undertaking of the petitioner 
that no back benefits shall be claimed.
