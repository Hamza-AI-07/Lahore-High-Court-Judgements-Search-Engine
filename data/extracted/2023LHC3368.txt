PRELUDE 
OF 
THE 
APPLICATION 
RAISING 
OBJECTION 
AGAINST 
TERRITORIAL 
JURISDICTION: 
 
3. 
While deciding application, the Court will dilate upon and 
interpret, at first instance, Section 5 (1) and Section 5 (4) of the “Act” 
in connection with status of a registered office of the company for the 
purpose of ascertaining jurisdiction by this Court, that too, keeping in 
view the legal track, process, procedure, limits and aim, object and 
purpose envisaged in the provisions of the “Act”, repealed Companies 
Ordinance, 1984 (the “Repealed Ordinance”), the Companies’ 
(Court) Rules, 1997, The High Courts (Establishment) Order (Punjab 
Amendment) Ordinance, 1981 (Pb Ord. I of 1981) (the “Amendment 
Ordinance”) and the Rules and Orders of Lahore High Court Volume 
V (the “Rules”). Since the petition under Section 286 of the 
Companies Act, 2017 (the “Act”) has to be decided by this Court in 
the light of recent judgment passed by this Court in “NADEEM KIANI 
Versus 
MS. 
AMERICAN 
LYCETUFF 
PVT 
LIMITED 
etc”  
(2021 CLD 7) but once the application on territorial jurisdiction has 
filed, the Court has to decide that first.

II. 
OVERTURE TO THE FACTS OF THE CASE 
4. 
Brief facts of the main case are that Petitioner No.1/M/s 
Mandviwalla Builders & Developers (the “Petitioner No.1”) Tariq 
Mehmood is a shareholder of Petitioner No.2/Mangla View Resort 
Pvt. Ltd. (the “Petitioner Company”) i.e. a Special Private Limited 
Company registered with the Respondent No.4 Securities & Exchange 
Commission of Pakistan (the “SECP”) for the purpose of designing, 
construction, development, marketing and selling the housing project 
on the land comprising 324 acres situated 7-Kilometer, Mangla 
Gadari  Road, Mangla Cantt including allowable covered area, retail 
component (without circulation), retail circulation, residential 
component, office component, amenity/recreational, parking (1000 
cars), service/misc area/lobbies, external development and total built-
up-area (the “Project Land”). It is noted that Tariq Mehmood is also 
the shareholder in Petitioner No.2 Mangla View Resort (Pvt.) 
Limited. In order to protect the rights of the parties, a joint venture 
agreement (the “JVA”) dated 16.02.2015 was executed between the 
“Petitioner No.1” and the “Petitioner Company” with an authorized 
capital of Rs.150,000,000/- setting up other commitments and 
business plan. The “Petitioner No.1” and Respondent No.1 have 
equal shares of 50% in the “Petitioner Company”. It is mentioned 
down in contents of main petition that the “JVA” was mutually 
terminated in accordance with clause 11 thereof, in relation whereto, 
another joint venture agreement dated 10.01.2018 (the “termination 
agreement”) was also executed amongst the “Petitioner No.1”, the 
“Petitioner Company”, Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.3, 
wherein M/S Harley Willington (Pvt) Limited (HW) (the “third 
party”) expressed its willingness to undertake the objectives of the 
above project and to settle all claims of the “Petitioner No.1” in the 
“project land”, in the event whereof, the “third party” issued seven 
cheques worth Rs.125 Million drawn on Soneri Bank Ltd. for the 
purpose of full and final settlement of the claims of the “Petitioner 
No.1”; however, only two cheques worth Rs.60 Million could be 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   4 
encashed as rest ones had bounced back with note of bank concerned 
that the “third party” had stopped payment and such act of the “third 
party” was in connivance with the Respondent No.1. It is further 
averred by the Petitioners that, after bouncing of cheques referred 
above, criminal cases were got registered as well as summary suit for 
recovery of amount was instituted under Order XXXVII of the 
“CPC” by the “Petitioner No.1” before Sindh High Court, Karachi. 
However, on basis of later patched compromise, further 20 Million 
PKR were paid to the “Petitioner No.1” by the “third party”, but due 
to its fault in payment of remaining agreed amount, the matter has not 
finally been settled. The Petitioners contended further that the 
Respondent No.1 though is Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and 
Director of the “Petitioner Company” beside lessee of the “project 
land”, but he has now established the Respondent No.2/M/s. Mangla 
Garrison Housing Private Limited (the “Respondent/Company”), that 
too, without informing the Petitioners and is shifting the entire capital 
of the “Petitioner Company” to the “Respondent Company”, which 
act is beyond the terms of the “JVA” and is in violation of the 
relevant Article of Association (the “AOA”) and Memorandum of 
Association (the “MOA”), in derogation of law envisaged in the 
“Act” as well as is in conflict to his fiduciary duties as being CEO 
and Director of the “Petitioner Company”. It is further agitated that 
the “Respondent Company” fraudulently and with mutual connivance 
of the “Respondent No.1”, has started illegal construction and 
development work on the “project land” without Petitioners’ 
permission and inviting them in the board’s meetings again in blatant 
violation of the “AOA” and the “MOA”. Hence, the Petitioners have 
approached this Court seeking interference to prevent injustice and 
also to cure the mismanagement on part of the “Respondent No.1”.

APPLICANTS/RESPONDENTS’S SUBMISSIONS: 
5. 
Syed 
Ijaz 
Ali 
Akbar 
Sabzwari, 
ASC 
for 
the 
Applicants/Respondents No.1&2 inter alia submitted that as per 
Section 5 of the “Act” the Civil Original petition can be 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   5 
filed/entertained at the place at which the registered office of the 
“Respondent Company” is situated/located and, as per Form-A, 
admittedly the “Registered Office” of the “Petitioner Company” is 
located at “Office No. 04, Ground Floor, Avais Chamber, I/C-5, 
Sikandar Malhi Road, Gulberg-II, Lahore”; that while filing this 
Civil Original, the Petitioners have malafidely concealed material 
facts of the case with intent and design to mislead this Court by way 
of banking upon misstated, incorrect and distorted facts in connection 
with the Registered Office of the “Petitioner Company”; that this 
Court is not seized with the territorial jurisdiction over the issue in 
controversy and the orders/directions rendered by this Court 
ultimately would be “void ab-initio” and “Qorum Non Judice” as well 
as of no legal consequences; that the main C.O on behalf of the 
Petitioners/Respondents is blended with fraud and misrepresentation, 
wherein they have secured interim restraining order from this Court 
and, without permission of the court, went on to publicize said order 
in media as well as widely circulated letters in connection thereto 
amongst the peers of applicants/Respondents thereby causing great 
deal of damage and loss to the business of the applicants/Respondents. 
Syed Ijaz Ali Akbar Sabzwari, ASC for Applicants/Respondents 
concluded stressing hard that this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain 
this matter and he prayed that the main C.O may be struck off the 
Register 
of 
this 
Bench 
and 
may 
be 
returned 
to 
the 
Petitioners/Respondents alongwith imposing heavy costs upon them 
for furnishing incorrect, misleading and misconceived information 
before this Court. In support of his contentions, he has relied upon the 
judgments of this Court reported as “PROVINCE OF PUNJAB 
through Secretary to Government of Punjab, Communication and 
Works 
Department, 
Lahore 
and 
another 
Versus 
Messrs 
MUHAMMAD TUFAIL and Company through Muhammad Tufail

others Versus NASREEN AHMED and 8 others” (2014 CLD 1039). 
IV 
RESPONDENTS/PETITIONERS’ SUBMISSIONS: 
6. 
Mr. Mohsin Kamal, Advocate for the Petitioners/Respondents 
inter alia argued that challenged activities of the Respondent No.1 
and the “Respondent Company” are illegal, unlawful, unjust and 
against all norms of natural justice, fairness and equity; that the 
actions of the Respondent No.1 and the “Respondent Company” are 
in absolute disregard to the “JVA”, the “AOA” and the “MOA” of the 
“Petitioner Company” requiring the notices of every meeting of the 
Board of Directors to be transmitted in advance and in writing whilst 
affording with reasonable time and disclosing the nature of business 
to be transacted in intended meeting; that the “AOA” and the “MOA” 
further required the whole business and affairs of the “Petitioner 
Company” to be subject to control and supervision of the Board of 
Directors as well as managed and controlled by CEO, which 
obligations contained in the “AOA” and the “MOA” were not 
honored by Respondent No.1 and the “Respondent Company”; that 
the Respondent No.1 got incorporated the “Respondent Company” in 
direct conflict with legally recognized interests of the Petitioners; that 
the act of the Respondent No.1 for collecting undue gains by way of 
transferring shares of the “Petitioner Company” to the “Respondent 
Company” without approval of Board meeting of the “Petitioner 
Company”, is in clear violation of Section 204 of the “Act”; that if 
any Director was directly or indirectly interested in any contract or 
arrangement entered into by the relevant company, he would be 
required to disclose the same in a meeting of the Directors, but the 
Respondent No.1 has failed to perform his duties in accordance with 
mandate provided by law; that Section 208 of the “Act” envisages 
that a company may enter into any contract or arrangement with a 
related party only in accordance with the policy approved by the 
board, but the Respondent No.1, despite of being CEO of the 
“Petitioner Company”, incorporated the “Respondent Company” 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   7 
without requisite approval by the board and transferred shares of the 
“Petitioner Company” to the “Respondent Company” setting forth 
illegal constructions and developments over the “project land”; that 
the conduct of Respondent No.1 and the “Respondent Company” are 
oppressive in nature towards the “Petitioner No.1” as well as 
members and creditors of the “Respondent Company”; that impugned 
acts of the Respondent No.1 and the “Respondent Company” are 
fraudulent, deceptive, illegal and without fulfillment of statutory/legal 
requirements contemplated in law, in result whereof, the “Petitioner 
Company” had not been run in proper manner and has been forced to 
undergo heavy financial loses necessitating it’s winding up; that legal 
notice transmitted by the “Petitioner No.1” with regard to above 
mentioned mal-handling at the hands of the Respondent No.1 and the 
“Respondent Company” was not responded/replied as well; that 
attending circumstances indicated surely qualify to agitate matter 
before court seeking the required investigation and ultimate desired 
protection of rights of the Petitioner Company and it’s members, 
which relief is aimed at to avoid further irreparable loss. To support 
his said submissions, learned counsel for the Petitioners/Respondents 
has relied upon pronouncements in cases titled “BROTHER STEEL 
MILLS LTD. and others Versus MIAN ILYAS MIRAJ and 14 others” 
(PLD 1996 Supreme Court 543), “Chairman Board of Directors, 
Jubilee Life Insurance Company Limited: In the matter of Show 
Cause Notice (2016 C L D 17), REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES 
Versus PAKISTAN INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL LEASING 
LIMITED and 30 others” (2005 CLD 463).  
7. 
In connection with in hand Application (C.M. No.03 of 2023), 
learned counsel for the Petitioners/Respondents has vehemently raised 
objection qua its maintainability by stating that all the relevant 
documents including tax returns, letter heads, etc. and JVA dated 
16.02.2015, the address of the office of the “Petitioner Company” is 
shown as “at 7-Kilometer, Mangla Gadari Road, Mangla Cantt”. He 
added that the “project land” exists in Mangla, which falls within the 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   8 
territorial jurisdiction of this Bench i.e. Rawalpindi Bench. He added 
that all the business activities are being conducted within the area of 
Rawalpindi, therefore, this Court is competent to entertain the civil 
original.  
V.

supported on behalf of SECP with submission that registered office of 
the “Petitioner Company” is situated at Office No.4, Ground Floor, 
Avais Chambers, 1/C-5, Sikandar Malhi Road, Gulberg II, Lahore as 
had been notified vide Form No. 21 dated 14.11.2014 therefore; this 
C.O is not maintainable before this Bench at Rawalpindi in terms of 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022

section 5(1) of the “Act”. Mr. Muzaffar Ahmed Mirza, Chief 
Prosecutor, Executive Director, Legal Affairs, SECP assisted by 
Syeda Muneeza Fatima, Special Public Prosecutor have relied upon 
pronouncements in cases titled “IFTIKHAR HUSSAIN and others 
Versus DADEX ENTERNIT and others” (2002 CLD 575), “ZAFAR

Peshawar Electric and Power Company (PEPCO) Versus SAJEEDA

VI. 
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT 
i. 
Prime desire of law to first cross barrier of 
question/objection of jurisdiction: 
 
9. 
Part II of the “Act” deals with jurisdiction of the Court and 
Section 5 of the “Act”, starts with the Court having jurisdiction under 
this Act shall be the High Court having jurisdiction in the place at 
which the registered office of the company is situated. Hence, the 
issue revolves around the point whether this Court at Rawalpindi 
Bench has the jurisdiction to entertain the titled Civil Original under 
the “Act”. The capacity of the Court to take account of any dispute 
submitted to it is called jurisdiction. Thus, without a specific 
jurisdiction, the Court will not possess the prowess to decide on a 
particular dispute. In company law matters, litigants before 
proceeding with their claim face with one most common question, 
sometimes perplexing, as to which Court shall have the territorial 
jurisdiction to hear and finally adjudicate the dispute. Section 5 of the 
“Act” deals with jurisdiction of the Court and the law contained in 
Constitution and relevant statutes civil and criminal code and statues 
on various subject matters clearly provide and demarcate jurisdiction 
of the Courts but in spite of the same, the common issue that often 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   10 
arises before the Court is with regard to territorial jurisdiction of the 
Courts. Jurisdiction of Court refers to power of the Court to deal with 
the matter and render a decision for its resolution. Jurisdiction of 
every court is on three counts i.e. Subject matter, Pecuniary and 
Territorial. Territorial jurisdiction refers to power of the court to 
inquire and proceed with the trial of matter that is presented before it. 
The issue of territorial jurisdiction of this Court under the “Repealed 
Ordinance” was being determined in terms of Section 7 of the 
“Repealed Ordinance” keeping in consideration location of the 
registered office of the Company, which provision has been kept 
intact in Section 5 of the “Act”. Thus, location of registered office of 
a company carries pivotal role and status while determining territorial 
jurisdiction of the Court dealing with company matters. This Court in 
the case of “IFTIKHAR HUSSAIN and others Versus DADEX 
ENTERNIT and others” (2002 CLD 575) and Peshawar High Court 
in “PHOENIX Security Service (Pvt.) Ltd through Director 
Commercial Versus Messrs EMERALD Mining Company (Pvt.) Ltd” 
(PLD 2000 Peshawar 78) have also dealt with the same issue by 
holding that the Court having jurisdiction under the “Repealed 
Ordinance” shall be the High Court having jurisdiction in the place at 
which registered office of the Company is situated.  
10. 
It is by now a settled law that if a mandatory condition for the 
exercise of a jurisdiction before a Court, tribunal or authority is not 
fulfilled, then the entire following proceedings become illegal and 
suffer from want of jurisdiction. So, there rests no room for stepping 
ahead with in hand Civil Original without first attending to and 
adjudicating upon question of jurisdiction as has been held by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled “ZAHID ZAMAN KHAN and 
others Versus KHAN AFSAR and others” (PLD 2016 SC 409) that 
“the law enjoins a duty upon the Court to settle question about its 
jurisdiction first because subject to certain exceptions, any decision 
rendered by the court having no jurisdiction stands vitiated on that 
account alone”. In “GOVERNMENT OF SINDH through Secretary 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   11 
Education and Literacy Department and others Versus NIZAKAT ALI 
and others” (2011 SCMR 592) it has been held that “every Court 
prior to taking cognizance and adjudicating upon an issue should first 
resort to the question of assumption of its jurisdiction and if it comes 
to the conclusion that jurisdiction can be assumed only then the issue 
can be adjudicated upon”. Further, it is held in case titled 
“PAKISTAN RED CRESCENT SOCIETY, PUNJAB PROVINCIAL 
BRANCH Versus ZIA ULLAH KHAN NIAZI” (2011 PLC (C.S) 
1640) it has been held that “The tenor of the afore-referred order 
passed by this Court indicates that the Tribunal had to decide the 
appeal afresh and "in accordance with law". The law includes the 
question of jurisdiction and the court ought to have decided the 
same in the first instance rather than relying on merely the remand 
order of this Court to assume jurisdiction”. Moreover, esteemed 
guideline with regard to deciding question of jurisdiction at very 
outset of judicial proceedings is enumerated in case titled “IZHAR 
ALAM FAROOQI, Advocate Versus SHEIKH ABDUL SATTAR LASI 
and others” (2008 SCMR 240) reading that “notwithstanding the 
raising of such an objection by the parties, the forum taking 
cognizance of the matter must at the first instance decide the question 
of its jurisdiction. There can be no exception to the principle that an 
order passed or an act done by a Court or a tribunal not competent to 
entertain the proceedings is without jurisdiction and that it is 
mandatory for the Court or tribunal as the case may be to attend the 
question of jurisdiction at the commencement of the proceedings”. It 
has also been held in case titled “KHYBER TRACTORS (PVT.) LTD. 
through Manager Versus PAKISTAN THROUGH MINISTRY OF 
FINANCE, Revenue and Economic Affairs, Islamabad” (PLD 2005 
SC 842) that “question of jurisdiction of a forum is always 
considered to be very important and any order passed by a Court or a 
forum, having no jurisdiction, even if is found to be correct on merits, 
is not sustainable. The jurisdiction of a Court lays down a foundation 
stone for a judicial or quasi-judicial functionary to exercise its 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   12 
powers/authority and no sooner the question A of jurisdiction is 
determined in negative, the whole edifice, built on such defective 
proceedings, is bound to crumble down …”. 
(ii) 
Purpose/object of The Companies Act, 2017: 
 
11. 
Returning to issue in the lis in hand, the Act was promulgated 
for facilitating corporatization and protecting interests of shareholders 
and it focuses on inculcating principles of good governance and 
safeguarding minority interests in corporate entities, being regulated 
by Board of Governors. Preamble of a Statue for sure signifies, 
confines and denotes aims it is destined for as has been held in case 
titled “Messrs Jet Green (Pvt.) Limited Versus FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN and others” (PLD 2021 Lahore 770) reading as 
follows: 
“7. … The preamble to a statute is though not an 
operational part of the enactment but it is a 
gateway, which opens before us the purpose and 
intent of the legislature, which necessitated the 
legislation on the subject and also sheds clear light 
on the goals which the legislator aimed to secure 
through the introduction of such law. The preamble 
of a statute, therefore holds a pivotal role for the 
purposes of interpretation in order to dissect the 
true purpose and intent of the law. …” 
 
12. 
Visiting preamble of the “Act” is abundantly clear when it is 
weighed on touchstone of above narrated esteemed observation. For 
ready reference, Preamble of the “Act” is reproduced as under: 
“WHEREAS it is expedient to reform company law 
with the objective of facilitating corporatization and 
promoting 
development 
of 
corporate 
sector, 
encouraging use of technology and electronic means in 
conduct of business and regulation thereof, regulating 
corporate 
entities 
for 
protecting 
interests 
of 
shareholders, creditors, other stakeholders and 
general public, inculcating principles of good 
governance and safeguarding minority interests in 
corporate 
entities 
and 
providing 
an 
alternate 
mechanism for expeditious resolution of corporate 
disputes and matters arising out of or connected 
therewith;

(iii) Anatomy of Section 5 of The Companies Act, 2017 
 
13. 
In relation to question of jurisdiction of this Court raised by 
Applicants/Respondents, the Court has to examine Section 5 of the 
“Act”, which mandates jurisdiction in a case to a High Court having 
jurisdiction in a place at which a “Registered Office” of the company 
is situated. For ready reference Section 5 ibid is reproduced as under:

any 
suit 
or 
proceeding in respect of any matter which the 
Court is empowered to determine by or under 
this Act. 
(3)

during the one hundred and eighty days 
immediately preceding the presentation of the 
petition for winding up.  
(4) 
There shall be, in each High Court, one 
or more benches on permanent basis, each to

Court to exercise the jurisdiction vested in the 
High Court under this Act: Provided that 
Benches constituted under the Companies 
Ordinance, 1984 (XLVII of 1984), shall

(iv) 
Comparative Study of In Force and Repealed 
Company Laws: 
 
14. 
Steering back in legislative history, vide Section 7 of the 
repealed Companies Ordinance, 1984 (the “Repealed Ordinance”), 
the Company Benches of the High Courts had the original jurisdiction 
in the companies matter, which status of jurisdiction is kept intact in 
the Act as well, however; in consonance with the concept of 
separation of executive and judicial powers in line with the esteemed 
pronouncement in case titled “MIAN MUHAMMAD NAWAZ SHARIF 
Versus PRESIDENT OF PAKISTAN and others” (PLD 1993 SC 
473), the powers of the Federal Government in Section 7 (1) of the 
repealed Ordinance enabling the Federal Government to notify civil 
courts to exercise all or any powers of the Company Bench has been 
done away in the Act eventuating in a state that now the Company 
Bench of a High Court has exclusive jurisdiction in company matters. 
For ready reference and the comparative study of the provisions of 
jurisdiction under Section 7 of the repealed Ordinance and under 
Section 5 of the Act, both provisions are reproduced hereunder: 
 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022

Companies Ordinance, 1984 
Companies Act, 2017 
7. Jurisdiction of the Court.- 
(1) The Court having jurisdiction 
under this Ordinance shall be 
the 
High 
Court 
having 
jurisdiction in the place at 
which the registered office of 
the company is situate: 
 
Provided 
that 
the 
Federal 
Government may, by notification 
in the official Gazette and 
subject to such restrictions and 
conditions 
as 
it 
thinks 
fit, 
empower any civil Court to 
exercise all or any of the 
jurisdiction by this Ordinance 
conferred upon the Court, and in 
that case such Court shall, as 
regards 
the 
jurisdiction 
so 
conferred, be the Court in 
respect of companies having 
their registered office within the 
territorial jurisdiction of such 
Court.  
(2) 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
jurisdiction 
to 
wind 
up 
companies, 
the 
expression 
"registered office" means the 
place which has longest been the 
registered office of the company 
during 
the 
six 
months 
immediately 
preceding 
the 
presentation of the petition for 
winding up.  
(3) Nothing in this section shall 
invalidate 
a 
proceeding 
by 
reason of its being taken in a 
Court other than the High Court 
or a Court empowered under 
sub-section (1). 
5. Jurisdiction of the Court and 
creation of Benches.- 
(1) The Court having jurisdiction 
under this Act shall be the High 
Court having jurisdiction in the 
place at which the registered 
office of the company is situate.  
(omitted) 
(2) 
Notwithstanding 
anything 
contained in any other law no 
civil court as provided in the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
(Act V of 1908) or any other 
court shall have jurisdiction to 
entertain any suit or proceeding 
in respect of any matter which 
the Court is empowered to 
determine by or under this Act.  
(3) 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
jurisdiction 
to 
wind 
up 
companies, 
the 
expression 
“registered office” means the 
place which has longest been the 
registered office of the company 
during the one hundred and 
eighty 
days 
immediately 
preceding the presentation of the 
petition for winding up. 
(4) There shall be, in each High 
Court, one or more benches on 
permanent basis, each to be 
known as the Company Bench, to 
be constituted by the Chief 
Justice of the High Court to 
exercise the jurisdiction vested in 
the High Court under this Act:

Pathology of Section 5 of the Companies Act, 2017 in 
connection with jurisdiction of High Court in company 
cases: 
 
15. 
Whilst reading the above reproduced provisions for the 
purpose of interpretation, the word “Court” is quite important and it is 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   16 
defined in Section 2(23) of the “Act” as that “Court means a 
Company Bench of a High Court having jurisdiction under this Act”. 
The “Act” under Section 5(7) envisages creation of a separate 
secretariat in each Company Bench of the respective High Court to 
provide secretarial support. The Company Bench under Section 6(10) 
of the “Act” can refer any matter to the Registrar of the Company 
Bench for recording of evidence, if deemed necessary.  Under Section 
5 (4) of the “Act”, the Chief Justice of the High Court has been given 
explicit powers to constitute Company Benches to exercise 
jurisdiction vested in the High Court under the “Act”. Since the Chief 
Justices of the respective High Courts have the exclusive powers to 
create more than one Company Benches, it is imperative to determine 
the jurisdiction as to which Company Bench will exercise powers in a 
particular case. Section 5(1) of the “Act” unequivocally provides that 
the jurisdiction shall be determined on the basis of place of the 
“registered office” of the company situated in the territorial 
jurisdiction of the respective High Court.  
16. 
Rules and Orders of Lahore High Court, Volume V, Part A, 
Rule 4 reads as follows: 
PART A: RULES FOR THE DISPOSAL OF EXECUTIVE 
AND ADMINISTRATIVE BUSINESS: 
1. 
The administrative and executive work of the 
High Court shall be controlled by a 
Committee of Judges to be known as the 
Administration Committee: 
Provided that those matters which are 
the exclusive concern of the Chief 
Justice, namely, the constitution of 
Benches and the appointment and 
control 
of 
the 
High 
Court 
Establishment shall be dealt with in 
accordance with such instructions as 
may from time to time be issued by the 
Chief Justice.

   17 
Administration Judge shall be defined by the 
Chief Justice from time to time. 
 
17. 
Moreover, 
under 
Section 
3-C 
of 
the 
High 
Courts 
(Establishment) Order (Punjab Amendment) Ordinance, 1981 (Pb 
Ord. I of 1981) (the “Ordinance 1981”), the Hon’ble Chief Justice 
have power to assign the area in relation to which each Bench shall 
exercise jurisdiction vested in the Lahore High Court. Said provision 
is reproduced as follows: 
SECTION (3-C): 
The Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court shall 
have power to make provision for all or any of 
the following matters, that is to say:- 
(a)  
assigning the area in relation to which 
each Bench shall exercise jurisdiction vested in 
the Lahore High Court; 
(b)   transferring proceedings pending in:- 
(i)  
the Lahore High Court; 
(ii)  
the Benches; and 
(iii)  the Circuit Court, if any; 
to a Bench or to a Circuit Court or to the Lahore 
High Court, as the case may be; and 
(c)  
determining cases or classes of cases 
which shall be disposed of by the Judges 
nominated to the Benches or the Circuit Courts; 
and for all matters incidental, supplemental and 
consequential thereto.” 
 
(iv) 
Significance of “registered office” in relation to jurisdiction 
in company lis: 
 
18. 
Whilst determining question of the “registered office”, 
consistent with the repealed Ordinance, Section 21 of the “Act” 
elucidates that the registered office will be the one where all 
communications and notices would be addressed to the company. For 
ready reference, Section 21 of the “Act” is reproduced hereunder; 
21. Registered Office of Company: 
(1) 
a company shall have a registered office to 
which all communications and notices shall be 
addressed and within a period of thirty days of 
its incorporation, notify to the registrar in the 
specified manner.  

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   18 
(2) 
notice of any change in situation of the 
registered office shall be given to the registrar in 
a specified form within a period of fifteen days 
after the date of change: provided that the 
change of registered office of a company from- 
  
(a) one city in a province to another; or  
(b) a city to another in any part of Pakistan not 
forming part of a province; shall require 
approval of general meeting through special 
resolution.  
(3) 
if a company fails to comply with the 
requirements of sub-section (1) or (2), the 
company and its every officer who is responsible 
for such non-compliance shall be liable to a 
penalty not exceeding of level 1 on the standard 
scale. 
 
19. 
Furthermore, the company is required to notify the registered 
office under regulation 4 of the Company (General Provisions and 
Forms) Regulations, 2018. Relevant part of regulation 4 is reproduced 
hereunder: 
4. Forms and Returns:- 
Pursuant to the provision of section 506 of the Act, formats of 
following forms and returns are specified which shall be used 
in all matters to which those forms and returns refer:  
 
S. 
No.  
Name

Relevant 
section/regulation 
 
 
 
 
27. 
Form 21 
Notice of situation of 
registered office of any 
change therein 
Section21 
 
(vii) Situation of registered office of the Petitioner Company: 
 
20. 
There is no denial that the “Petitioner Company” filed  
Form-21 dated 14.11.2014 with the concerned Registrar notifying 
change of registered office of the company from 7-km Mangla Gadari 
Road, Mangla District Jehlum to a new registered office situated at 
Office No. 4, Ground Floor, Avais Chambers, 1/C-5, Sikandar Malhi 
Road, Gulberg II, Lahore. Consequently, SECP issued an 
acknowledgment through Letter No. JR-I/0047808 dated 30.12.2014.  
 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   19 
 
(viii) Consistent dictates of preceding pronouncements: 
 
21. 
This Court has examined the record with the valuable 
assistance of parties, which reveals that the “Registered Office” of the 
Petitioner/Company is located at “Office No. 04, Ground Floor, Avais 
Chamber, I/C-5, Sikandar Malhi Road, Gulberg-II, Lahore”.  It is to 
be remembered all the way long in discussion to follows that all issues 
arising out of the “Act” are to be dealt with by the Company Judge of 
a Court having jurisdiction at the place where the registered office of 
the Company is situated, which in the present case is “Lahore High 
Court, Lahore (Principal Seat)”, where admittedly the registered 
office of the Petitioner/Company is located.  
22. 
Attending issue of jurisdiction, concept of jurisdiction is 
elaborated in case titled “PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through Secretary 
to Government of Punjab, Communication and Works Department, 
Lahore and another Versus Messrs MUHAMMAD TUFAIL AND 
COMPANY through Muhammad Tufail (deceased) through Legal 
Heirs (PLD 2017 Supreme Court 53) by the Supreme Court wherein 
it has been held that: 
“14. The concept of jurisdiction of a Court 
encompasses (i) territorial jurisdiction, (ii) pecuniary 
jurisdiction and (iii) subject matter jurisdiction. The 
concept of jurisdiction has its genesis in the physical 
power of a Court to issue process to persons within the 
reach of the Court. Shorn of all extraneous 'frills', this 
is the essence of jurisdiction. A Court is to decide 
matters when persons relating thereto are within its 
reach. This basic jurisdiction is then regulated by 
defining the limits of that 'reach' by setting pecuniary 
limits, or by assigning different 'subjects' within one 
territory to different Courts, for example, by assigning 
banking and environmental matters to different Courts 
within one territory. …” 
 
23. 
Having also been referred and relied in “MCB Bank Limited 
Versus ADEEL SHAHBAZ STEEL MILLS and others” (2023 LHC 
2922) (LHC Citation), this Court in case titled “BAHOO DYING 
INDUSTRIES (Private) Limited Versus SUI NORTHERN GAS 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   20 
PIPELINES LIMITED etc.” (PLD 2021 Lahore 186) has elaborated 
the concept of jurisdiction reading as follows: 
“8.    The concept of jurisdiction has its genesis in the 
physical power of a Court to issue process to persons 
within the reach of the Court. The jurisdiction of a 
legal 
forum/Court 
includes 
its 
(i) 
territorial 
jurisdiction; (ii) pecuniary jurisdiction; and (iii) 
subject matter jurisdiction. The jurisdiction is always 
conferred upon the Courts by a law and it cannot be 
decided by the parties inter se. The territorial 
jurisdiction refers to a Court's power over actions 
and parties within the bounds of a particular 
territory. If a Court does not have territorial 
jurisdiction over the events or persons within it, then 
the Court cannot give a binding decision regarding 
the rights of the parties.” 
 
24. 
Discussions earlier above utmost clarify that the “Act” is pari 
materia and successor to the Repealed Ordinance. With reference to 
Section 7(1) of the Repealed Ordinance, Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
a case titled “CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, Peshawar Electric 
And Power Company (PEPCO) and another Versus SAJEEDA 
BEGUM and others [2023 PLC (C.S) 90 = 2022 SCMR 2058] has 
observed that: 
“8. … As was correctly pointed out by the ASC for 
PESCO, PESCO is a body corporate that had been 
incorporated under the Companies Ordinance of 
1984. Therefore, for the purposes of this instant 
petition, section 7(1) of the Companies Ordinance, 
1984 is relevant. It is reproduced below for 
reference:- 
         
7. Jurisdiction of the Court 
(1) 
The Court having jurisdiction under this 
Ordinance 
shall 
be 
the 
High 
Court 
having 
jurisdiction in the place at which the registered office 
of the company is situate: 
Provided that the Federal Government may, by 
notification in the official Gazette and subject to such 
restrictions and conditions as it thinks fit, empower 
any civil Court to exercise all or any of the 
jurisdiction by this Ordinance conferred upon the 
Court, and in that case such Court shall, as regards 
the jurisdiction so conferred, be the Court in respect 
of companies having their registered office within the 
territorial jurisdiction of such Court. …”  

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   21 
11. As far as the merits of PESCO's petition are 
concerned, PESCO is regulated by the Companies 
Ordinance of 1984 and therefore, the relevant High 
Court for the purposes of issuance of any directions 
under Article 199 of the Constitution is the High 
Court where the main office of PESCO is situated. 
PESCO's headquarters are situated in Peshawar, 
KPK and none of its activities are undertaken within 
the territorial jurisdiction of the Islamabad High 
Court. It has no place of business, branch office or 
presence in any of the territories that fall within the 
jurisdiction of the Islamabad High Court. Therefore, 
in the absence of anything to the contrary, reading 
Article 199 of the Constitution with section 7 of the 
Companies Ordinance of 1984, brings us to the un-
escapable conclusion that the relevant High Court for 
the purposes of issuing any directions (if at all any 
High Court could assume jurisdiction) would have 
been the Peshawar High Court and not the Islamabad 
High Court.” 
 
25. 
Whilst determining “Civil Original Jurisdiction” of High 
Courts in company matters, it has been observed in a case titled 
“BROTHER STEEL MILLS LTD. and others Versus MIAN ILYAS 
MIRAJ and 14 others” (PLD 1996 SC 543): 
“4. … The proceeding was initiated under the 
Ordinance which under subsection (11) of 
section 2 provides:-  
“the Court' means the Court having jurisdiction 
under this Ordinance."  
Section 7 confers jurisdiction on the High Court 
in the following manner:- 
"Jurisdiction of the Courts:- 
(I) The Court having jurisdiction under this 
Ordinance shall be the High Court-having 
jurisdiction in the place at which the registered 
office of the company is situate …  
Section 8 provides that the Chief Justice of the 
High Court shall constitute one or more Benches 
each known as Company Bench to exercise 
jurisdiction under section 7. The procedure of the 
Court is provided by section 9 which shall be 
summary. From these provisions it is clear that 
the High Court or a Court empowered under 
section 7(l) has been vested with the jurisdiction 
to entertain, hear, try and decide the matters and 
cases arising under the Ordinance. Such 
jurisdiction 
has 
been 
conferred 
by 
the 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   22 
Ordinance. 
The 
proceedings 
under 
the 
Ordinance are initiated in the High Court as a 
Court of first instance. While exercising such 
jurisdiction it has the characteristics and 
attributes of original jurisdiction. …” 
 
26. 
In another case titled “ZAFAR IQBAL Versus NASREEN 
AHMED” (2014 CLD 1039), it has been held that “Section 7 of the 
Companies Ordinance 1984 provides jurisdiction to a High Court at a 
place where the registered office of the company is situated. 
Admittedly and in pursuance of the memorandum of association the 
registered office of the Fazal Rehman Fabrics Limited is in province 
of Punjab. It does not need any lengthy discussion that all issues 
arising out of the Companies Ordinance, 1984 are to be dealt by the 
company Judge of a Court having jurisdiction at a place where the 
registered office of the company is situated which in the present case 
is Lahore High Court, where admittedly registered office of defendant 
No. 2 is situated. The distinction in section 7 of the Companies 
Ordinance was made only in respect of the winding up petition. In 
terms of sub-section (2) of section 7 for the purpose of winding up the 
registered office is one which has longest been the registered office of 
the company during last six months immediately preceding the 
presentation of the petition for winding up, however this is not the 
case here”. Again, on subject issue of territorial jurisdiction, while 
dilating upon Section 7 of the “Repealed Ordinance”, it has been held 
in a case titled “IFTIKHAR HUSSAIN and others Versus DADEX 
ENTERNIT and others” (2002 CLD 575) that “The provisions of 
Section 7(1) of the Companies Ordinance, 1984 are absolutely clear 
that it is the High Court having jurisdiction in the place at which the 
registered office of the Company is situated which can entertain any 
matter under the Companies Ordinance, 1984.” Dealing with matter 
of extension of the “Repealed Ordinance” under Article 247 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, it has been held in 
a case titled “PHOENIX Security Service (Pvt.) Ltd through Director 
Commercial Versus Messrs EMERALD Mining Company (Pvt.) Ltd” 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   23 
(PLD 2000 Peshawar 78) that “The Court has been defined by 
section 2(11) of the Company Ordinance, 1984, the Court means the 
Court having jurisdiction under this Ordinance and according to 
section 7(1), the Court having jurisdiction under this Ordinance shall 
be the High Court having jurisdiction in the place at which registered 
office of the Company is situated. According to section 8 of the 
Ordinance there shall in each High Court be one or more Benches, 
each to be known as the company bench to be constituted by the Chief 
Justice of the High Court to exercise the jurisdiction vested in the 
High Court under section 7.”. Again the matter involving extension of 
the Repealed Ordinance under Article 247 of the Constitution was 
dealt with in a case titled “ABDUL RAUF and another Versus Messrs 
MIFATAH UDDIN FLOUR MILLS (Pvt.) Ltd. and others” (PLD 
2000 Peshawar 83) by holding that “The Court has been defined by 
section 2(11) of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, the Court means the 
Court having jurisdiction under this Ordinance and according to 
section 7(1), the Court having jurisdiction under this Ordinance, shall 
be the High Court having jurisdiction in the place at which registered 
office of the Company is situated. According to section 8 of the 
Ordinance there shall in each High Court be one or more benches, 
each to be known as the company bench to be constituted by the Chief 
Justice of the High Court to exercise the jurisdiction vested in the 
High Court under section 7. … However, here in this case this fact is 
not of much importance due to location of Company's registered office 
as mentioned in the memorandum of association is N.W.F.P. and the 
dispute is also not related to Company. While holding that this Court 
has got the jurisdiction over PATA I also hold that this Court has got 
no jurisdiction in the matter …” 
 
VII. 
CONCLUSION: 
 
27. 
In view of above enumerated facts, circumstances and law, it is 
confirmed that the registered office of the “Petitioner Company” is 
situated at Lahore, therefore, Rawalpindi Bench of this Court lacks 
jurisdiction to entertain the Civil Original. Accordingly, C.M.No.03 of 

 
C.M.No.03 of 2023 
           AND  
Civil Original No.11 of 2022                
 
 
 
 
 
 
   24 
2023 is allowed and in consequence thereof, Civil Original (C.O. 
No.11 of 2022) be returned to the Petitioners to be filed before the 
Company Judge at Principal Seat of this Court, if so advised.
