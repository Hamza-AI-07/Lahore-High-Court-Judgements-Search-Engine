JAWAD HASSAN, J. This judgment will decide the suit 
filed under Section 9 of the Financial Institution (Recovery of 
Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (the “Ordinance”) whereby an amount of 
Rs.103,007,781.63 along with cost of funds from the date of default 
till realization of debt is claimed by the MCB Bank Limited (the

The above said finance facilities were secured through 
execution of documents i.e. Promissory Note dated 08.01.2015, 
Finance Agreement dated 09.01.2015 and Personal Guarantee dated 
09.01.2015. Vide request letter dated 23.04.2015, the “Defendant 
Company” again approached the “Plaintiff Bank” for enhancement of 
aforementioned facilities which were approved vide Facility Advising 
Letter dated 07.05.2015. On 16.09.2019, the “Defendant Company” 
made request to the “Plaintiff Bank” for restructuring/rescheduling of 
outstanding amount of Rs.124,973,072.73 which was accordingly 
acceded to vide Facility Advising Letter dated 23.09.2019. Due to 
non-fulfilling financial obligations and default in repayments under 
the renewed/restructured finance facilities, the “Plaintiff Bank” 
claimed to recover an amount of Rs.103,007,781.63 in respect of 
following finance facilities with breakup as follows: 
Account Facility  
Amount of Principal 
Payable 
Markup Payable

To refute the claim of the “Plaintiff Bank”, the Defendants 
filed petition under Section 10 of the “Ordinance” for the grant of 
unconditional leave to defend the suit (“PLA”). The “Defendants” 
though denied the liabilities alleged by the “Plaintiff Bank” yet 
objected to maintainability of suit before this Court on the basis of 
territorial jurisdiction.

SUBMISSIONS OF LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE 
PLAINTIFF 
 
5. 
Barrister Umer Aslam, counsel for the “Plaintiff Bank” inter 
alia stated that the “Defendant Company” is a partnership concern 
having business of furnace and re-rolling steel while the Defendant 
No.2 is a partner having share ratio of 50%; the Defendant No.3&4 
are also partners having share ration of 25% each and they stood 
guarantors and furnished their personal guarantees for securing 
repayments against Restructured Demand Finance (“RDF”) and 
Forced Demand Finance (“FED”); that the “Defendant Company” 
vide Facility Advising Letter dated 16.09.2019 requested to the 
“Plaintiff Bank” for restructuring/rescheduling of outstanding amount 
of Rs.124,973,072.73 and same was approved vide letter dated 
23.09.2019 and for this purpose, a finance restructuring and 
rescheduling agreement was executed on 07.10.2019 followed by 
Addendums for restructuring/rescheduling  dated 20.07.2020 and 
12.07.2021 respectively; that due to non-fulfilling financial 
obligations and default in repayments under the renewed/restructured 
finance facilities, the “Plaintiff Bank” claimed to recover an amount 
of Rs.103,007,781.63 in respect of finance facilities with breakup as 
mentioned in para 2 above. 
 
D. 
SUBMISSIONS OF THE COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANTS 
NO.1&2 
 
6. 
Mr. Umar Hanif Khichi, Advocate filed the “PLA” on behalf 
of the Defendants No.1&2 and inter alia submitted that the suit is not 
maintainable on score of territorial jurisdiction of this Court because 
the finance facilities, as alleged by the “Plaintiff Bank” were 
extended to the “Defendant Company” at Hattar Industrial Estate, 
Haripur, Khyber Pakhtunkhawa and the agreements pursuant thereto 
were also executed thereat, thus the plaint is liable to be returned to 
the Plaintiff to be presented before Banking Court at Haripur under 

 
Civil Original Suit No.01 of 2022                 
 
 
 
 
 
   4 
order VII Rule 10 CPC; that the suit is liable to be dismissed as the 
same does not comply with the mandatory requirements of Section 9 
of the “Ordinance” more specifically sub sections (2) and (3) wherein 
obligations have been casted upon a financial institution to file with 
the plaint all the relevant documents as well as to give details 
regarding the finance alleged to have been disbursed, availed and 
repaid; that the Defendants No.1&2 have paid the availed amounts 
under aforementioned facilities but the “Plaintiff Bank” has alleged 
exaggerated amount, which, under the law, is not tenable; that it is 
settled law that any suit filed by a financial institution/bank must be 
supported by a properly verified statement of account on oath, 
whereas the statements of accounts filed by the “Plaintiff Bank” are 
not duly verified on oath and they failed to fulfill other requirements 
of the Bankers Books Evidence Act, 1981 as well, which is a 
mandatory requirements in terms of Section 9 of the “Ordinance”, 
thus no presumption of truth can be attached to the same, and in view 
of such glaring defect in the Statement of Account, the suit of the 
“Plaintiff Bank” is liable to be dismissed.  
 
D. 
SUBMISSIONS OF DEFENDANTS No.3&4 
 
7. 
Defendants No.3&4 filed the “PLA” alleging that they have no 
concern with the availed finance facilities because they resigned from 
the partnership after receiving their shares and shifting the liabilities 
to the new partners.  
 
E. 
REPLY 
BY 
LEARNED 
COUNSEL 
FOR 
THE 
PLAINTIFF  
 
8. 
While exercising the right of rebuttal, Barrister Sardar Umer 
Aslam, Advocate, reiterated the contents of plaint as well as 
replication to the “PLA” and has urged that the “Defendants” have 
admitted the execution of finance facilities and security documents as 
is evident from the Finance Restructuring Agreement dated 
07.10.2019, Addendum to Finance Restructuring and Rescheduling 

 
Civil Original Suit No.01 of 2022                 
 
 
 
 
 
   5 
Agreement dated 20.07.2020 and 2nd Addendum to Finance 
Restructuring and Rescheduling Agreement dated 12.07.2021 and it is 
a well settled law that the admitted facts need not to be proved, 
therefore, upon admission of the execution of the finances and 
security documents, the “PLA” cannot be granted on this score alone 
and the same is liable to be dismissed. Learned counsel further stated 
that the claim of the “Plaintiff Bank” is genuine, supported by the 
documents executed by the “Defendants” and Statement of Accounts 
had been duly signed and certified by the competent persons; all the 
entries relating to availing of the finance facility and repayments had 
been duly reflected in the statement of accounts and outstanding 
balance has also been shown in the said statement. Next maintained 
that the “Defendants” have not complied with mandatory 
requirements of Section 10 of the “Ordinance”. With regard to 
objection qua territorial jurisdiction of this Court, Barrister Umer 
Aslam, Advocate argued that the registered office of the “Defendant 
Company” is within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court, office 
address thereto is that of Rawalpindi, partnership deed was also 
registered with Registrar of Firms at District Rawalpindi and loan 
documents executed between the parties also contained address of 
District Rawalpindi therefore, this Court has jurisdiction to decide the 
lis in hand.  
F. 
ARGUMENTS OF AMICUS CURIAE 
9. 
Agha Muhammad Ali Khan, ASC/Amicus Curiae argued that 
a Banking Court in terms of Section 7(2) of the “Ordinance” is 
empowered to adopt procedure laid down in the “CPC” and for the 
purpose of determining jurisdiction, Section 20 of the “CPC” confers 
territorial jurisdiction upon the Banking Court to decide the cases in 
which the defendant resides, carries on business or personally works 
for gain, or in which the cause of action arises wholly or partly within 
the local limits of such Court. He has referred to judgments cited in 
“BAHOO DYING INDUSTRIES (PRIVATE) LIMITED Versus SUI 
NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES LIMITED and others” (PLD 2021 

 
Civil Original Suit No.01 of 2022                 
 
 
 
 
 
   6 
Lahore 186), “Messrs HI LITE INDUSTRIES and 4 others Versus 
MUSLIM COMMERCIAL BANK LIMITED” (2004 CLD 1266) and 
“EMIRATES BANK LTD Versus M. IRFAN MONNO and another” 
(1993 CLC 2430).  
10. 
I have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the 
parties and perused the record. 
G. 
DETERMINATION 
BY 
THE 
COURT 
ON 
THE 
TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION 
 
(i) 
Maintainability of banking suit at initial stage. 
 
11. 
When the suit was filed on 29.09.2022 and the Court while 
confronting the territorial jurisdiction, observed as under: 
5. 
When further confronted how this Court 
can interfere into the matter as per Section 5 of 
the Ordinance read with the judgment passed 
by this Court in the case of “Bahoo Dying 
Industries (Private) Ltd. Versus Sui Northern 
Gas Pipelines Limited and others” (PLD 2021 
Lahore 186), Barrister Umer Aslam, ASC 
contends that since the registered office of the 
Company is based at Rawalpindi and the 
properties are situated nearby, therefore, this 
Court is fully empowered to execute the decree 
obtained”.  
 
12. 
Subject to maintainability of the suit, the Court issued notices 
to the Defendants to file the “PLA” which was filed on 14.12.2022 
raising the preliminary objection qua territorial jurisdiction of this 
Court to entertain the suit. In response to the said objection, the 
counsel for the “Plaintiff Bank” filed replication under Section 10(8) 
of the “Ordinance” wherein it was stated as follows: 
“The suit has been properly instituted before 
this Hon’ble Court, as Defendant No.1 has a 
registered 
office 
within 
the 
territorial 
jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court. The 
partnership deed is registered with the 
Registrar of Firms, District Rawalpindi. The 
office address of the Defendant No.1 is that of 
Rawalpindi, as show in in the documents 
appended with suit. The partnership deed also 
describes the head office of the firm to be 

 
Civil Original Suit No.01 of 2022                 
 
 
 
 
 
   7 
located at the address, so mentioned in the 
plaint (Defendant No.1). The loan was 
obtained on documents containing the address 
of the Rawalpindi”. 
 
13. 
At the very outset it is observed here that the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in its judgment reported as “ZAHID ZAMAN KHAN and 
others Vs. KHAN AFSAR and others” (PLD 2016 SC 409) has held 
that “the law enjoins a duty upon the Court to settle question about its 
jurisdiction first because subject to certain exceptions, any decision 
rendered by the court having no jurisdiction stands vitiated on that 
account alone”. In “GOVERNMENT OF SINDH through Secretary 
Education and Literacy Department and others Versus NIZAKAT ALI 
and others” (2011 SCMR 592) it has held that “every Court prior to 
taking cognizance and adjudicating upon an issue should first resort 
to the question of assumption of its jurisdiction and if it comes to the 
conclusion that jurisdiction can be assumed only then the issue can be 
adjudicated upon”. Esteemed guideline with regard to deciding 
question of jurisdiction at very outset of judicial proceedings is 
enumerated in case titled “IZHAR ALAM FAROOQI, Advocate Versus 
SHEIKH ABDUL SATTAR LASI and others” (2008 SCMR 240) 
reading that “notwithstanding the raising of such an objection by the 
parties, the forum taking cognizance of the matter must at the first 
instance decide the question of its jurisdiction. There can be no 
exception to the principle that an order passed or an act done by a 
Court or a tribunal not competent to entertain the proceedings is 
without jurisdiction and that it is mandatory for the Court or tribunal 
as the case may be to attend the question of jurisdiction at the 
commencement of the proceedings”. 
14.  
Learned counsel for the “Plaintiff Bank” was confronted with 
the point of territorial jurisdiction before going into the merits of the 
case and he was asked to first cross the hurdle of maintainability of 
the suit in view of territorial jurisdiction of this Court. In response 
thereto, learned counsel for the “Plaintiff Bank” Barrister Umer 
Aslam, ASC has placed reliance on “BAHOO DYING INDUSTRIES 

 
Civil Original Suit No.01 of 2022                 
 
 
 
 
 
   8 
(PRIVATE) LIMITED Versus SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES 
LIMITED and others” (2021 PLD Lahore 186), “NATIONAL BANK 
OF PAKISTAN Versus Messrs KOHINOOR SPINNING MILLS and 
others” (2021 CLD 1112), “MOHAMMAD AFSAR Versus Mst. 
NAZIR BEGUM” (2018 CLC 259), “HABIB BANK LIMITED Versus 
Haji RIAZ AHMED” (2017 CLC 1671), “Haji RIAZ AHMED Versus 
HABIB BANK LIMITED” (2012 CLD 491), “Messrs HI LITE 
INDUSTRIES Versus MUSLIM COMMERCIAL BANK LIMITED” 
(2004 CLD 1266) and “MUHAMMAD WASEEM GHORI Versus 
ALTAF HUSSAIN TUNIO” (2016 YLR 157) and contended that this 
Court has jurisdiction to decide the lis in hand in view of the referred 
judgments. 
(ii) 
Legal anatomy of jurisdiction of Banking Court under 
the Ordinance. 
 
15. 
The “Ordinance” was promulgated for the recovery of 
finances and the financial institutions as defined under Section 2(a) of 
the “Ordinance” which stipulates the transaction of banking business 
in Pakistan through its branches. The word branches mentioned 
therein means a branch from where the suit is to be filed before the 
Banking Court having jurisdiction to entertain it. In this case, the suit 
was filed by the “Plaintiff Bank” from the registered office at MCB 
House, 15-D, Main Gulberg, Lahore having one of its branch offices 
at Hattar Industrial Area and before this Court at Rawalpindi as is 
evident from paragraph No.1 of the suit. The “Plaintiff Bank” by 
complying with requirement of Section 9 of the “Ordinance” attached 
statement of account verified by the branch manager of MCB Hattar 
Industrial Estate Branch. Moreover, Section 9(1) of the “Ordinance” 
stipulates the word Branch Manager which if read with Section 2(a) of 
the “Ordinance” means that the suit is to be filed by the said branch 
manager in terms of Section 9(2) and 9(3) of the “Ordinance” which 
demonstrate the amount availed by the defendant, paid by the 
defendant to the financial institution and other amounts relating to 
finance payable by the defendant. If the wording of Section 9 is read 

 
Civil Original Suit No.01 of 2022                 
 
 
 
 
 
   9 
with Section 5 of the “Ordinance” it makes clear that the Banking 
Court established to exercise its jurisdiction under the “Ordinance”. 
Section 5(1) of the “Ordinance” deals with the Banking Court to 
considers necessary to exercise jurisdiction under the “Ordinance”. In 
order to decide the lis in hand, this court has first to decide the 
preliminary objection qua territorial jurisdiction as raised by the 
counsel for the “Defendants”.  
(iii) Pathology of Section 10 of the Ordinance. 
 
16.  
The wording of Section 10(1) of the “Ordinance” states that in 
any case in which the summons has been served on the defendant 
under Section 9(5) the defendant shall not be entitled to defend the suit 
unless he obtains leave from the Banking Court. While Section 10(3) 
of the “Ordinance” give a chance to the defendants to file leave to 
defend containing substantial questions of law as well as of fact. In the 
case in hand, the addresses of the Defendants are mentioned as of 
Islamabad and Hattar whereas only the registered office of the 
“Defendant Company” is based on Rawalpindi. As Section 2(a) read 
with Section 9(5) of the “Ordinance” mentions branch offices, the 
amount of finance availed, carrying on or transaction of business 
therefore; the statement of account being sent to the defendants at their 
addresses would also be taken into consideration while deciding the 
leave to defend.  
17. 
Pertinently, the “Ordinance” was enacted by the Government 
to ensure speedier recovery of the finances advanced by the financial 
institutions and to make the banks recovery law more effective 
preamble of which reads as under: 
 
WHEREAS it is expedient to repeal and with 
certain modifications, reenact the Banking 
Companies (Recovery of Loans, Advances, 
Credits and Finances) Act, 1997, for the 
purposes hereinafter appearing; 
 

 
Civil Original Suit No.01 of 2022                 
 
 
 
 
 
   10 
AND WHEREAS the President is satisfied that 
circumstances exist which render it necessary 
to take immediate action; 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in pursuance of the 
proclamation of Emergency of the fourteenth 
day of October, 1999 and Provisional 
Constitution Order No. I of 1999, read with 
the Provisional Constitution (Amendment) 
Order No. 9 of 1999, and in exercise of all 
powers enabling him in that behalf, the 
President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 
is pleased to make and promulgate the 
following Ordinance”. 
 
. 
The above extracted preamble clearly provides that the same 
was enacted to expedite the process of stuck-up loans from the 
unscrupulous customers/debtors of the banks. Though the preamble to 
a statute is not an operational part of the enactment but it is a gateway, 
which discusses the purpose and intent of the legislature to necessitate 
the legislation on the subject and also sheds clear light on the goals 
that the legislator aims to secure through the introduction of such law. 
The preamble of a statute, therefore, holds a pivotal role for the 
purposes of interpretation in order to dissect the true purpose and 
intent of the law. Reliance in this regard is placed on “DIRECTOR 
GENERAL, FIA AND OTHERS Versus KAMRAN IQBAL and others” 
(2016 SCMR 447) whereby the Supreme Court held that “indeed, 
preamble to a Statute is not an operative part thereof, however, as is 
now well laid down that the same provides a useful guide for 
discovering the purpose and intention of the legislature”. It would be 
advantageous to add that the purpose and object of the “Ordinance” 
has already been elaborated by this Court in the case of “NATIONAL 
BANK OF PAKISTAN Versus Messrs KOHINOOR SPINNING MILLS 
and others” (2021 CLD 1112) in the following manner: 
“It is deemed pertinent to take a precise note on 
the purpose and object of the “Ordinance” and 
the mechanism provided thereunder to settle the 
financial 
disputes 
between 
the 
financial 
institutions and customers who availed finance 

 
Civil Original Suit No.01 of 2022                 
 
 
 
 
 
   11 
facilities 
therefrom. 
The 
Ordinance 
was 
promulgated with an aim to streamline and 
expedite financial disputes between a financial 
institution and its customers and separate 
independent forum of Banking Court was also 
established under the Ordinance to achieve the 
goal of speedy decisions and a mechanism was 
devised wherein traditional extensive course of 
litigation was curtailed to a composite summary 
procedure to make sure adjudication in 
expeditious manner but at the same time 
safeguarding and securing rights of the parties 
and that is why Banking Courts defined under 
Section 2(b) and established under Section 5 of 
the Ordinance is simultaneously vested with 
powers of a Civil Court under the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 and powers of a Court of 
Sessions under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1898 as per Section 7 of the Ordinance”. 
 
18. 
Section 2(b) of the “Ordinance” defined the Banking Court, in 
respect of a case, (i) in which the claim does not exceed hundred 
million rupees, and for the trial of offences under the “Ordinance”, 
in terms of section 2(b)(i), (ii) means, a court established under 
section 5 of the “Ordinance”, and in respect of any other case, the 
High Court. While Section 5 of the “Ordinance”, enables the 
Federal Government to establish Banking Courts to exercise 
jurisdiction under the “Ordinance”. Being creature of the statute, 
the Banking Courts drive powers/jurisdiction under Section 7 of the 
“Ordinance” which reads as: 
7. Powers of Banking Courts. (1) Subject to the 
provisions of this Ordinance, a Banking Court shall__ 
(a) 
in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction have all the 
powers vested in a civil court under the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908); 
(b) ……………………………. 
 
(2) 
A Banking Court shall in all matters with respect 
to which the procedure has not been provided for in this 
Ordinance, follow the procedure laid down in the Code 
of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908), and the Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898). 
 
(3) ……………………………… 

 
Civil Original Suit No.01 of 2022                 
 
 
 
 
 
   12 
 
(4) ……………………………… 
 
(5) ……………………………… 
 
(6) ……………………………… 
(7) ……………………………… 
 
  
The above referred provision of law stipulates that the Banking 
Court, in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction, shall have all powers 
otherwise available to a Civil Court under the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as the “CPC”). By virtue of 
the said provision, the Banking Court is bound to follow the 
procedure as provided in the “Ordinance”, however where it is silent, 
the procedure provided in the “CPC” shall apply. Pertinently, the 
Banking Courts are creatures of statute and they derive their 
powers/jurisdiction from Section 7(4) read with Section 9(1), 2(a), 
2(c), 2(d), 2(e) and 4 of the “Ordinance” and where the “Ordinance” 
does not prescribe a particular procedure with respect to a matter, the 
proceedings under the “Ordinance” are to be governed by the 
“CPC”) as held by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled 
“HABIB BANK LTD. Versus WRSM TRADING COMPANY, LLC and 
others” (PLD 2018 SC 795). Reliance is also placed on “GULISTAN 
TEXTILE MILLS LTD. and another Versus SONERI BANK LTD. and 
another” (PLD 2018 SC 322) where the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
has held that “a Banking Court is to follow the procedure laid down 
in the C.P.C. in all matters with respect to which the procedure has 
not been provided in the Ordinance”. 
19. 
It is added that Section 20 of the “CPC” contains a general 
rule regarding territorial jurisdiction which inter alia, enjoins that a 
suit must be instituted in a court within the local limits of whose 
jurisdiction the Defendant actually and voluntarily resides, or carries 
on business, or personally works for gain, or where the cause of action 
wholly or in part arises. The explaination to said section prescribes 
that a corporation shall be deemed to carry on business at its sole or 
principal office, or, in respect of any cause of action arising at any 

 
Civil Original Suit No.01 of 2022                 
 
 
 
 
 
   13 
place where it has also a subordinate office, at such place. Since this 
provision primarily keeps the Defendant in perspective, the 
corporation spoken of in the Explanation, obviously refers to the 
Defendant. A plain reading of the said sectionarguably allows the 
Plaintiff a multitude of choices in regard to where it may institute its 
lis, suit or action. Corporations and partnership firms, and even sole 
proprietorship concerns, could well be transacting business 
simultaneously in several cities. If sub-sections (a) and (b) of said 
Section are to be interpreted disjunctively from sub-section (c), as the 
use of the word ‘or’ appears to permit the Plaintiff to file the suit at 
any of the places where the cause of action may have arisen regardless 
of whether the Defendant has even a subordinate office at that place. 
However, if the Defendants’ location is to form the fulcrum of 
jurisdiction, and it has an office also at the place where the cause of 
action has occurred, then the Plaintiff is precluded from instituting the 
suit anywhere else. Obviously, this is also because every other place 
would constitute a forum non conveniens.  
20. 
Barrister Umer Aslam, Advocate for the “Plaintiff Bank” 
argued that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit as the 
registered office of the “Defendant Company” falls within the 
territorial jurisdiction of this Court and that the partnership deed was 
also registered with Registrar of Firms, Rawalpindi. While on the 
other hand, learned counsel for the Defendants Mr. Umar Hanif 
Khichi, Advocate stated that this court lacks territorial jurisdiction for 
the reasons that finance facilities, as alleged by the “Plaintiff Bank”, 
were extended to the Defendants at Hattar Industrial Estate, Haripur 
and the agreements pursuant thereto were also executed at Islamabad 
and Hatter, thus, plaint of this  suit is liable to be returned to the 
Banking Court concerned under order VII Rule 10 of the “CPC” for 
its presentation.  
21. 
The concept of jurisdiction has already been elaborated by this 
Court in the case of “BAHOO DYING INDUSTRIES (PRIVATE) 
LIMITED Versus SUI NORTHERN GAS PIPELINES LIMITED and 

 
Civil Original Suit No.01 of 2022                 
 
 
 
 
 
   14 
others” (2021 PLD Lahore 186) by relying on the judgment of 
Supreme Court of Pakistan cited in “Messrs Muhammad Tufail and 
Company through Muhammad Tufail (deceased) through Legal Heirs 
(PLD 2017 SC 51) where it was held that “Section 20, C.P.C. confers 
jurisdiction on a Court in two ways. Firstly, on the basis of where a 
defendant(s) resides, carries on business or works for gain within its 
local limits. Secondly on the basis of where the cause of action wholly 
or in part arose within its local limits. Jurisdiction means the 
authority to decide. The concept of jurisdiction of a Court 
encompasses (i) territorial jurisdiction, (ii) pecuniary jurisdiction and 
(iii) subject matter jurisdiction. The concept of jurisdiction has its 
genesis in the physical power of a Court to issue process to persons 
within the reach of the Court. Shorn of all extraneous 'frills', this is 
the essence of jurisdiction. A Court is to decide matters when persons 
relating thereto are within its reach. This basic jurisdiction is then 
regulated by defining the limits of that 'reach' by setting pecuniary 
limits, or by assigning different 'subjects' within one territory to 
different 
Courts, 
for 
example, 
by 
assigning 
banking 
and 
environmental matters to different Courts within one territory.” 
22. 
No doubt, the registered office of a defendant/firm serves as 
official address for legal and administrative purpose and determines 
the jurisdiction to which the firm is subject to but at the same time it is 
important to note that the registered office does not necessarily 
determines the sole basis for establishing jurisdiction, especially when 
the cause of action arises in a different location/city and in cases 
where the cause of action accrues in a different city, such as the 
location of the contract execution, the place where the cause of action 
arose, or the defendant’s reside may also be considered in determining 
the appropriate jurisdiction for legal proceedings.
