Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – On 5.6.2021, around 7:00 a.m., 
Khadim Hussain/ASI was on patrol with other police officials near the 
NP/28 Bridge in Mauza Walana. During their patrol, he received 
information via a „15 Call‟ that the family of Tahira, daughter of Qamar 
Din, suspected her of having illicit relations with Ehsan Khaliq, son of 
Khaliq Dad. Consequently, Petitioners No.3 and 5 (Allah Yar and Sibghat 
Ullah) and Respondents No.4 to 6 (Ejaz Ahmad, Amanullah, and Daud) 
murdered both of them and then threw Ehsan Khaliq‟s body in the canal. 
Upon receiving this information, Khadim Hussain/ASI and other officials 
hurried to the canal. They retrieved Ehsan‟s corpse and prepared his 
injuries statement. Then, Khadim Hussain/ASI reported the incident to 
Police Station Ahmadpur Lama, District Rahimyar Khan, on which FIR 
No.233/2021 dated 5.6.2021 was registered under sections 302, 311, 148, 
and 149 PPC. Later, Tahira Bibi‟s body was found in Sanjarpur Ahmad 
Wah. 
2. 
 
During the investigation, the police discovered that on the 
night of 4th June 2021, nine persons, namely Asfandyar, Asad Yar, Allah 

Crl. Revision No.37/2023 
 
- 2 - 
Yar, Ahmad Yar, Sibghat Ullah (the Petitioners), and Ejaz Ahmad, 
Amanullah, Daud, and Summar Walana, abducted Ehsan Khaliq and 
Tahira within the jurisdiction of Police Station Ahmadpur Lama. 
Subsequently, they murdered them and threw their bodies in the Wah 
Canal. The report under section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted accordingly. 
The Additional Sessions Judge framed the charge against them. They 
pleaded not guilty. 
3. 
 
On 15.1.2022, Respondent No.3 (Qamar Din, father of 
Tahira deceased) filed a private complaint titled “Qamar Din v. Sikandar 
and 06 others”. He stated that Ehsan was his relative who developed 
illicit relations with his daughter Tahira. On 5.6.2021, when he was away 
from his house, Ehsan, Sikandar, Abid Hussain, Muhammad Qasim and 
Sajid, along with 8/10 unidentified persons, abducted Tahira at gunpoint 
and sped on motorcycles. Her cries drew three members of his family to 
the scene, including Ghulam Muhammad, Qadir Dina and Gul Jahan. 
They chased the accused who resorted to aerial firing to scare them away 
but they continued to follow them. The accused took Tahira to the Ahmad 
Wah Canal, where Qasim (Respondent No.11) strangled her. When Ehsan 
tried to intervene, Sajid raised a lalkara that he should also be killed along 
with Tahira for bringing disgrace to the family‟s honour. Qasim tossed the 
semi-unconscious Tahira into the canal, while Sikandar and Abid throttled 
Ehsan to death. Subsequently, the accused disposed of his body into the 
canal and fled. The Additional Sessions Judge summoned Sikandar etc. to 
face trial and indicted them on 7.1.2023. 
4. 
 
On 27.5.2022, Respondent No.11 (Muhammad Qasim) being 
dissatisfied with the police investigation of FIR No. 233/2021, filed a 
private complaint against Allah Yar and eight others (including Ahmad 
Yar, Sibghat Ullah, Asad Yar, Asfandyar, Amanullah, Ejaz, Daud, and 
Muhammad Yar Walana). This complaint, titled “Muhammad Qasim v. 
Allah Yar etc.”, mirrored the narrative of the State case (which is also 
called the “challan case”) and cited the same witnesses as mentioned 
therein. Notably, it omitted Summar Walana and introduced Muhammad 
Yar Walana as an additional accused.

5. 
 
On 1.10.2022, relying upon Nur Elahi v. The State  
(PLD 1966 SC 708), the Petitioners made an application before the 
Additional Sessions Judge praying that the proceedings in the challan case 
and the private complaint titled “Muhammad Qasim v. Allah Yar etc.” be 
held in abeyance till the final decision of the private complaint titled 
“Qamar Din v. Sikandar etc.”. The Additional Sessions Judge dismissed 
that application by order dated 7.1.2023. He held that Nur Elahi’s case did 
not apply to the facts and circumstances of the present case and directed 
that both the complaints and the challan case proceed side by side. 
6. 
 
This revision petition under section 439 Cr.P.C. read with 
section 435 Cr.P.C. is directed against the above-mentioned order dated 
7.1.2023. 
7. 
 
This Court appointed Syed Zeeshan Haider, Advocate, as an 
amicus curiae. He argued that in the landmark Nur Elahi case, the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan settled the procedure for dealing with 
situations where there is a challan case and a private complaint arising 
from the same occurrence. However, he pointed out that the aforesaid 
case does not cover all possible scenarios involving different versions of 
the incident. It does not propose automatic prioritization of a private 
complaint in all eventualities because such an approach would contradict 
the letter and spirit of the law. Mr Haider submitted that individuals 
frequently file private complaints with ulterior motives. Taking advantage 
of the fact that the defence cannot present its case during proceedings 
under section 204 Cr.P.C., they often secure summonses for the accused. 
Then, exploiting the Nur Elahi precedent, they attempt to halt the 
proceedings of the challan/police case which obstructs the dispensation of 
justice. 
8. 
 
Mr Haider argued that there are three versions of the 
occurrence in the present case – the challan case and two private 
complaints. These versions cannot be consolidated into one trial and must 
be tried independently. The challan case and Qasim‟s private complaint 
differ significantly. In the challan case, police have also charged Summar, 
while Qasim has not mentioned him and has included Muhammad Yar 
Walana among the accused. On the other hand, Qamar Din‟s private 

Crl. Revision No.37/2023 
 
- 4 - 
complaint is a counter version introduced by the accused in the challan 
case. Mr Haider maintained that the Additional Sessions Judge had rightly 
concluded that the principle established by the Supreme Court in  
Nur Elahi is inapplicable to the current situation. According to Mr Haider, 
the Petitioners in the present case want their complaint to be heard and 
decided first. This request is a classic example of how the Nur Elahi case 
is misinterpreted, and a party can exploit it to impede the smooth 
functioning of the legal system. 
Opinion 
9. 
 
The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, does not explicitly 
outline the procedure for conducting a trial when there is a challan case 
and a private complaint related to the same offence.1 Judicial precedents 
have 
addressed 
this 
lacunae. 
In 
Nur 
Elahi 
v. 
The 
State  
(PLD 1966 SC 708), a man named Muzaffar Piracha was murdered. The 
FIR mentioned Ch. Zafar-ul-Haq, Ikram-ul-Haq, and Nawaz-ul-Haq as 
the alleged perpetrators. However, after an investigation, the police 
charged one Ch. Ikram and Banarass. They mentioned Ch. Zafar-ul-Haq 
and his son, Nawaz-ul-Haq, in Column No.2 of the challan, implying that 
no case had been established against them. Dissatisfied, the complainant, 
Nur Elahi, filed a complaint in which he repeated his version of the 
occurrence described in the original FIR. This situation raised the 
question of how to proceed with the trial of these two cases. The Supreme 
Court of Pakistan ruled that a fair procedure would entail the trial judge 
first taking up the complaint case. During this trial, the judge may call 
witnesses mentioned in the police challan as court witnesses under section 
540-A Cr.P.C., if they had not already been examined on behalf of the 
complainant. This would enable both parties to cross-examine these 
witnesses, consolidating all relevant evidence into a single trial. The 
accused persons would also have the opportunity to present their defence 
evidence. As a result, the judge would be able to make an informed 
decision based on a thorough review of the evidence presented by the 
parties. If the trial results in a conviction, the Public Prosecutor would 
decide whether to withdraw the prosecution in the challan case, with the 
                                          
1 When there are two versions of the same incident, some Judges compendiously call them “case and 
counter case” and others as “cross cases”.

court‟s permission, as per section 494 Cr.P.C. It would be easy for him to 
make such a decision after going through all the evidence produced in the 
first trial. If the said trial ends in an acquittal, the Public Prosecutor might 
still consider whether the evidence adduced in the first trial had 
significantly weakened the police version, justifying a withdrawal of the 
prosecution. If not, the second trial would proceed to its normal 
conclusion, and both parties can make use of the material brought on 
record by cross-examining the relevant witnesses, as permitted by law. 
10. 
 
Kaikaus J. authored a separate opinion in Nur Elahi, 
dissenting from the above approach. He held that the two proceedings 
should be consolidated and that there should be a single hearing, that the 
whole evidence be produced before the Sessions Court and then a 
decision recorded. 
11. 
 
In Muhammad Sadiq v. The State and another  
(PLD 1971 SC 713), the Sessions Judge concluded the trial of a 
State/challan case under sections 148, 302, 307, 149, PPC and scheduled a 
date to deliver his judgment. Simultaneously, a Magistrate of the First 
Class was conducting the trial of a counter complaint case filed by one of 
the accused in the challan case, which stemmed from the same incident. 
Against this backdrop, the accused in the challan case applied under 
section 561-A Cr.P.C. for restraining the Court of Sessions from 
announcing judgment in the challan case until the proceedings of the 
complaint case had concluded. The High Court acceded to this prayer and 
stayed the announcement of the judgment by the Sessions Judge. The 
Supreme Court noted that the Code is silent about the procedure for the 
trial of counter-cases arising from the same occurrence. Although it is a 
common practice to try such counter-cases concurrently before the same 
court until their conclusion and to deliver judgments in both cases 
simultaneously, it is not an absolute rule that must always be followed. 
The facts and circumstances of a particular case may warrant a different 
procedure for the ends of justice. The Supreme Court accepted the appeal, 
set aside the High Court‟s order and directed the Sessions Judge to 
pronounce the judgment.  

Crl. Revision No.37/2023

12. 
 
In Zulfikar Ali Bhutto v. The State (PLD 1979 SC 53), the 
appellant contended that his trial was vitiated because the complaint case 
should have been tried before the challan case as per the ruling in  
Nur Elahi’s case. The Supreme Court held that the two cases had 
fundamentally distinct circumstances. They were not “cross cases” in the 
typical sense of that term. Consequently, it ruled that the procedure 
outlined in Nur Elahi did not need to be followed invariably. The relevant 
excerpt from page 77 is reproduced below: 
“57. 
In the instant case, the version is the same which is not the 
feature in the above-cited case; and as for the accused cited in the 
complaint case, the appellant is common in both cases, whereas 
Masood Mahmood, who would have also been an accused in the 
challan case has been granted pardon and examined as an approver. 
Saeed Ahmad Khan is a witness in the challan case, while Rao Abdur 
Rashid is neither a witness nor an accused in that ease, and it may be 
stated that the complainant has not implicated either of them as accused 
in his evidence in the challan case. Therefore, there was no necessity 
for a separate trial of the two cases when technically speaking, there 
were neither two sets of accused nor different versions nor any 
additional evidence to be examined by the complainant. It was only to 
avoid prejudice to the complainant that a particular procedure was 
devised in the reported case of Nur Elahi, but to say that invariably it 
should be followed even if the facts are distinguishable is not correct, 
as it does not amount to a declaration of law. Having held so, we might 
also point out that the objection to the trial, if any, should have been 
taken before the trial Bench, and not having done so, it is too late in the 
day to urge that it has caused prejudice to the appellant when factually 
none is shown.” 
13. 
 
In Aziz Begum v. Muhammad Khushdil and another  
(PLD 1981 Karachi 141), the Sindh High Court ruled that in every case 
where there is a direct complaint and a separate charge, it is not 
mandatory to proceed with them consecutively. The guiding criterion is 
whether there are competing versions. If there are, the Nur Elahi case 
would be applicable. In other situations, however, separate trials are 
unnecessary because they would result in inconsistent judgments and 
waste public resources. 
14. 
 
In Raja Khushbakhtur Rehman and another v. The State 
(1985 SCMR 1314), the Supreme Court stated that Nur Elahi does not lay 
down any inflexible rule that the complaint case must always be tried 
first. A second trial may not be necessary if the version and the accused 
are the same in both the complaint and the challan cases.

15. 
 
In 
Rashid 
Ahmad 
v. 
Asghar 
Ali 
and 
others  
(PLD 1986 SC 737), the High Court determined that the principle laid 
down in Nur Elahi would apply because the versions in the complaint and 
the challan case were different, and the sets of accused in the two cases 
were also not the same. The Supreme Court upheld the ruling and added 
that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto v. The State (PLD 1979 SC 53) and Raja 
Khushbakhtur Rehman and another v. The State (1985 SCMR 1314) have 
not modified the principle established in Nur Elahi. 
16. 
 
In Karim Bakhsh v. Zulfiqar and others (1997 SCMR 334), 
the private complaint and the FIR contained the same allegations. The 
Supreme Court ruled that the two cases need not be tried separately in 
these circumstances. The High Court had erred in relying on Nur Elahi. 
17. 
 
The above-mentioned judgments show that the procedure 
outlined in the Nur Elahi case is generally recommended. Nevertheless, 
some situations may require a departure from it. These can be categorized 
into two distinct groups: (a) cases where there are two prosecution 
versions regarding the same incident but entirely or partially different 
from the one reported earlier through the first information report, and  
(b) cases where there are different versions of the same incident by rival 
parties. I take the opportunity to glean the guiding principles from the 
decisions rendered over time. As regards the first category, these are as 
follows: 
i) 
Where the party lodging the FIR also files a private complaint 
containing the same allegations against the same set of accused 
persons, the trial court will try the complaint case first and put the 
challan case on hold until its decision.2 
ii) 
Whenever the facts or circumstances allow, cross-cases 
involving two different versions of the same incident and two distinct 
sets of accused must be tried together in the same court. The rationale 
is that if the two cases giving different accounts of the same incident 
are not tried concurrently, there is a considerable risk of conflicting 
judgements.3 
iii) 
Where the complaint case is instituted after the FIR is lodged 
and not only there are differences in the names of some of the accused, 
but at least one person mentioned in the FIR as an accused is excluded 
and replaced by another individual, the complaint case must be taken 
up first for trial as stipulated in Nur Elahi. This is particularly essential 
when the two sets of allegations made in the said two cases regarding

Crl. Revision No.37/2023

the weapons used and the roles ascribed to the various accused are 
materially different.4  
iv) 
When the persons nominated as accused in the private 
complaint are the same as those named in the FIR, the trial court has 
the authority to summon the individuals listed in Column No. 2 of the 
report filed by the police under section 173 Cr.P.C. However, if the 
police introduce a new individual as an accused who has not been 
mentioned by the complainant in the private complaint, the procedure 
recommended in the Nur Elahi case is the most suitable approach. In 
simpler terms, if, during an investigation, the police include or exclude 
any accused in the report under section 173 Cr.P.C., but the 
complainant adheres to their initial version, then the proceedings in the 
private complaint should be prioritized and completed first, while the 
challan case should be put on hold as directed in Nur Elahi.5  
v) 
While a consolidated trial of challan and complaint cases is not 
recommended, the Supreme Court will not interfere with the order of 
acquittal recorded by the trial court and High Court if such a trial did 
not cause a failure of justice (due to the unworthy and unreliable 
evidence available with prosecution), and the complainant did not 
object to it before the trial court.6 
18. 
 
Now, let‟s consider the second classification. If the rival 
parties advance different versions of the same incident through cross-
cases and such different versions contain different sets of accused 
persons, the trial of such cases is to be held simultaneously and side by 
side. The same court must hear and decide them to avoid conflicting 
judgments.7  
19. 
 
There may be instances where the private complaint is 
instituted by one of the accused persons in the challan case rather than the 
original complainant party, with different versions, separate sets of 
witnesses, and different accused. In Abdul Shakoor v. The State  
(2012 PCrLJ 231), this Court held that in such a situation, the principle 
laid down in Nur Elahi to try the private complaint and challan case 
sequentially need not be followed. The two cases should instead be 
proceeded side by side. 
20. 
 
In Kamran v. The State and others (2016 PCr.LJ Note 34), 
two private complaints regarding the same occurrence featuring the same 
accused and identical sets of witnesses were filed. This Court ruled that 
                                          
4 Syed Muhammad Hussain Shah v. Abdul Hamid and others (1981 SCMR 361). 
5 Mumtaz and others v. Mansoor Ahmad and another (1984 SCMR 221). 
6 Niaz Ahmed v. Hasrat Mahmood and others (PLD 2016 SC 70). 
7 Muhammad Sadiq v. The State and another (PLD 1971 SC 713), Abdul Rehman Bajwa v. Sultan and 
others (PLD 1981 SC 522), Rashid Ahmad v. Asghar Ali etc. (PLD 1986 SC 37) and Mst. Rasool Bibi v. 
The State and another (2000 SCMR 641), Niaz Ahmed v. Hasrat Mahmood and others  
(PLD 2016 SC 70).

the Sessions Judge should have consolidated these cases instead of 
holding separate trials. Additionally, it rejected the suggestion of the 
respondents‟ counsel that the proceedings in one of the cases should be 
stayed because it could potentially prejudice the second complainant. 
There was a possibility that the complainant from the first complaint may 
not call the other complainant as a witness in court.  
21. 
 
Let‟s now turn to the case at hand. FIR No. 233/2021 dated 
5.6.2021 was registered at the instance of a police officer, Khadim 
Hussain/ASI, rather than a private party because of some unique 
circumstances. During the investigation, the police found that nine 
persons, including Asfandyar, Asad Yar, Allah Yar, Ahmad Yar, Sibghat 
Ullah (the Petitioners) and Ejaz Ahmad, Amanullah, Daud and Summar 
Walana, abducted Ehsan Khaliq and Tahira from within the remit of 
Police Station Ahmadpur Lama. Subsequently, they murdered them and 
threw their bodies in the Wah Canal. The report under section 173 Cr.P.C. 
was submitted accordingly. Respondent No.11, a legal heir of one of the 
deceased, filed the private complaint titled: “Muhammad Qasim v. Allah 
Yar etc.” against Allah Yar and eight others (including Ahmad Yar, 
Sibghat Ullah, Asad Yar, Asfandyar, Amanullah, Ejaz, Daud, and 
Muhammad Yar Walana). Respondent No.11 adopted the same version 
and, excluding the formal witnesses, cited the same witnesses as 
mentioned in the challan case but named Muhammad Yar Walana as an 
additional accused. Notably, Summar Walana was not an accused in this 
private complaint. Given the principles discussed above, in my opinion, 
the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court in Nur Elahi should be 
followed. The said private complaint must be taken up first, and the 
challan case should be kept dormant. I rely upon Mumtaz and others v. 
Mansoor Ahmad and another (1984 SCMR 221). 
22. 
 
The Additional Sessions Judge has expressed concern in the 
impugned order dated 7.1.2023 that if the proceedings of the State case 
are stayed, what would be the fate of accused Summar Walana, who has 
been indicted in the State case but Respondent No.11 (Qasim) has not 
named him in his private complaint. Nur Elahi‟s case provides a 
comprehensive response to this issue. Refer to paragraph 9 of this 
judgment. 

Crl. Revision No.37/2023

23. 
 
Respondent No.3 has filed a private complaint titled  
“Qamar Din v. Sikandar and 06 others” which gives an entirely different 
version of the occurrence. In fact, it is a counter-version of the challan 
case and Qasim‟s private complaint. This complaint must be tried 
alongside the complaint titled “Muhammad Qasim v. Allah Yar etc.” by 
the same court until their conclusion, and the judgment in each case 
should be delivered concurrently.  
24. 
 
Today, when this petition was taken up for hearing,  
Mr Muhammad Aslam Khan, Advocate, stated that he wanted to 
withdraw it. His request cannot be entertained because this Court has a 
statutory duty to ensure that the lower courts conduct proceedings in 
accordance with the law. It can exercise revisional powers, even suo motu, 
when it comes to its notice that they have not done so. The present case 
calls for the exercise of that power. Hence, the impugned order dated 
7.1.2023 is set aside, and the Additional Sessions Judge is directed to 
proceed according to the observations made in paragraphs 21 to 23.
