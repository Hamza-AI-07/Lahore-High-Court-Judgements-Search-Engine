JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
 
 
MUHAMMAD RAZA QURESHI, J.  Through this Writ Petition 
under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973, the Petitioner has called into question the legality and 
validity of Order dated 26.08.2022 passed by the learned Revisional 
Court, whereby the Revision Petition of the Respondents was allowed 
and Order dated 09.12.2021 passed by the learned Civil Judge 
allowing the application for setting aside ex-parte Judgment and 
Decree dated 19.10.2019 was set aside. 
2. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the 
Impugned Order is illegal and unlawful. According to learned counsel, 
no notice was ever served upon the Petitioner, who is resident of 
Tehsil Gojra District Toba Tek Singh, whereas, the suit was filed by 
the Respondents in Tehsil Samundari, District Faisalabad. Learned 
counsel for the Petitioner submits that the mandate of provisions of 
Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ( the “CPC”) was not

Writ Petition No.70519 of 2022                                                  -2- 
 
 
followed by the learned Trial Court, therefore, the substituted service 
through newspaper remained ineffective in terms of law. Contends 
that neither the acknowledgement due (“A.D.”) was received nor 
report on summons was submitted before the learned Trial Court and 
consequently the Order for ex-parte proceedings merging into ex-
parte Judgment and Decree was passed with undue haste and the same 
is nullity in the eye of law. Adds that the learned Civil Judge lawfully 
appreciated the legal position and allowed the application filed by the 
Petitioner, whereas through the Impugned Order by reversing the said 
Order, the learned Revisional Court has committed material 
irregularity and the same is liable to be set aside. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondents 
submits that the suit was filed at correct address of the Petitioner i.e. 
Street No.1, Mohallah Gulshan Colony, Tehsil Gojra, District Toba 
Tek Singh, therefore, the Petitioner cannot claim that the notices were 
not issued upon him. Learned counsel also submits that application for 
seeking condonation of delay along with application for setting aside 
of ex-parte Judgment and Decree failed to substantiate a sufficient 
cause justifying its delayed institution. Further submits that the 
Impugned Order passed by the learned Revisional Court is in 
accordance with law and since the Petitioner defaulted in appearance 
before the learned Trial Court, it had no other option but to pass ex-
parte Judgment and Decree. Learned counsel concludes that the 
instant Petition is liable to be dismissed. 

Writ Petition No.70519 of 2022                                                  -3- 
 
 
4. 
The arguments of learned counsel for the parties have 
been heard and record has been perused with their able assistance, 
which reflects that on 10.05.2018 the Respondents/Plaintiffs filed a 
suit against the Petitioner seeking cancellation of agreement to sell 
dated 19.12.2017 along with permanent injunction. As per contents of 
the plaint, the Respondents averred that they were owners in 
possession of suit property situated in Chak No.47-GB Tehsil 
Samundari District Faisalabad, which they agreed to sell to the 
Petitioner/Defendant. The total sale consideration mentioned in the 
subject agreement to sell was Rs.23,000,000/- and earnest money 
received by the Respondents was in the sum of Rs.2,500,000/-, 
whereas the remaining sale consideration in the amount of 
Rs.20,500,000/- was liable to be paid on 30.04.2018. On account of 
failure of the Petitioner to pay the balance sale consideration on the 
due date, the Respondents were constrained to institute the suit, which 
was filed in Tehsil Samundari District Faisalabad. 
5. 
Upon institution of suit, through order dated 10.05.2018 
summons/notices were issued to the Defendant, who is Petitioner 
before this Court at address of Street No.1, Gulshan Colony Gojra, 
Tehsil Gojra District Toba Tek Singh, through registered A.D. and 
process fee was directed to be deposited. On 23.05.2018 the summons 
through registered post A.D. were repeated as the Respondents had 
failed to deposit process fee in time. On 04.06.2018 notices through 
mode prescribed earlier were repeated as according to report of 
Ahlmad on the order sheet, the summons had not returned nor receipt 

Writ Petition No.70519 of 2022                                                  -4- 
 
 
of register A.D. was produced. On 26.06.2018 which is crucial date, 
only 
receipt 
of 
registered 
post 
A.D. 
was 
filed 
by 
the 
Respondents/Plaintiffs and the learned Trial Court passed an order 
that the Petitioner/Defendant could not be served through summons, 
therefore, he be served through substituted service by way of 
publication in the daily newspaper ‘Asas’. Upon the publication in the 
newspaper, nobody entered appearance on behalf of the Petitioner, 
therefore, on 11.07.2018 the Petitioner was proceeded ex-parte. 
Thereafter, case kept adjourning on one pretext or the other and 
finally after recording oral as well as documentary evidence of the 
Respondents/Plaintiffs the learned Trial Court passed ex-parte 
Judgment and Decree dated 19.10.2019.  
6. 
As per contents of the Application filed by the Petitioner 
a legal notice was sent to the Respondents on 22.12.2020 contending 
that under the subject matter agreement to sell the Respondents had 
defaulted. In reply to the said legal notice sent by the Respondents on 
12.02.2021, it was disclosed that the subject matter agreement to sell 
was no more in the field pursuant to Judgment and Decree dated 
19.10.2019. Thereafter on 27.02.2021 the Petitioner filed an 
application seeking setting aside ex-parte Judgment and Decree along 
with an application seeking condonation of delay under Section 5 of 
the Limitation Act, 1908. The said application was allowed by the 
learned Trial Court through Order dated 09.12.2021. The Respondents 
challenged the said Order before the learned Revisional Court, who 

Writ Petition No.70519 of 2022                                                  -5- 
 
 
upheld the ex-parte Judgment and Decree by reversing the Order 
dated 09.12.2021 passed by the learned Civil Judge. 
7. 
The contentious issue seeking resolution is whether the 
Petitioner was ever served in accordance with law. Admittedly, in the 
instant case, the summons issued to the Petitioner was never returned 
with any report, whereas, though receipts of registered post A.D. were 
presented but the learned Trial Court never received back the card of 
A.D., therefore, the Order dated 26.06.2018 that Petitioner could not 
be served through summons appears to have been passed in betrayal 
of mandate of law and it seems that the learned Trial Court failed to 
exercise its jurisdiction in accordance with law.  
8. 
The first obligation of the learned Trial Court was that if 
it had noticed that the Petitioner was resident of another District, the 
safest mode should have been to follow the provisions of Order V 
rules 21 and 23 of the CPC, which provides that if Defendant resides 
within the jurisdiction of another Court, the summons shall be sent by 
the Court by which it is issued either by one of its officers or by post 
to any Court having jurisdiction in the place where the defendant 
resides. Under rule 23 of Order V of the CPC, the Court to which  
summons are sent under rule 21 shall, upon receipt thereof, proceed as 
if it had been issued by such Court and shall then return the summons 
to the Court of issue, together with the record of its proceedings with 
regard thereto.  
9. 
The Order dated 26.06.2018 has been analyzed in the 
light of said provisions of law and it is observed that while issuing the 

Writ Petition No.70519 of 2022                                                  -6- 
 
 
summons to the Petitioner/Defendant, those provisions were 
overlooked by the learned Trial Court, which upon non-return of 
summons sent by the issuing Court and non-receipt of A.D. was sine 
qua non for the service of Petitioner/Defendant. Failure of the Trial 
Court to follow the mandate contained in provisions of Order V rules 
21 and 23 of the CPC had serious consequence and order for issuing 
substituted service through publication was nullity in the eyes of law. 
Reliance in this regard is placed upon the judgment reported as Rana 
Jahangir Khan vs. Manzoor Ahmad (PLD 2012 Lahore 204).  
10. 
The provisions of rules 16, 17 and 18 of  Order V of the 
CPC were also ignored by the learned Trial Court as the said 
provisions are not illusory and it was bounden duty of the Court to 
ensure substantial compliance of these provisions before directing 
substituted service as unless provisions contained in rules 16, 17, 18, 
21 and 23 are not satisfied, the order for substituted service under 
Order V rule 20 of the CPC is nullity in the eyes of law as the Court 
for the said purpose has to satisfy itself that all the efforts to affect 
service in the ordinary mode have failed.  Non-adherence to the 
mandatory provisions renders the process of service through 
publication invalid and edifice built automatically falls down. 
Reliance in this regard is placed upon the judgment reported as 
Yaqoob Ali through L.Rs. and others vs. Muhammad Ayub and others 
(PLD 2021 Lahore 678).  
11. 
Adherence and observance to these provisions is  
mandatory as due service is the first fundamental right of every 

Writ Petition No.70519 of 2022                                                  -7- 
 
 
litigant, who is to defend his cause before the court of law. Therefore, 
it is not only a formality but a matter of importance that these 
provisions are duly complied with. According to law laid down by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in judgment reported as Mrs. Nargis Latif 
vs. Mrs. Feroz Afaq Ahmed Khan (2001 SCMR 99) “unless all efforts 
to effect service in the ordinary manner are verified to have failed, 
substituted service cannot be resorted to.” 
12. 
There is no cudgel to the conclusion derived by the 
learned Revisional Court in the Impugned Order that the substituted 
service is as effective as personal service and the court may on the 
failure of defendant to appear when the suit is called for hearing, 
proceed with the hearing of the suit ex-parte as substituted service has 
always been equated with that of due service. But the learned 
Revisional Court failed to advert that the said effectiveness can only 
be presumed authentic if either record or order reflects that the 
provisions of Order V in relation to service of summons or through 
registered A.D. have been duly complied with. As the remedy of 
substituted service can be resorted to only if the court is satisfied that 
there is a reason to believe that the other side is shying out only to 
avoid the service. Reliance in this respect is placed on the judgment 
reported as Sana Jamali vs. Mujeeb Qamar and another (2023 SCMR 
316). 
13. 
Now adverting to the question whether the application 
filed by the Petitioner was barred by time or not, suffice is to observe 
that under Article 164 of the Limitation Act, 1908, a defendant may 

Writ Petition No.70519 of 2022                                                  -8- 
 
 
seek setting aside of ex-parte decree within a period of thirty days and 
Column No.III of the said Article provides that these thirty days are to 
be computed from the date of decree or where the summons were not 
duly served when the applicant had knowledge of the decree. 
14. 
In the instant case, it has already been discussed above 
that Order of ex-parte proceedings was passed without following the 
mandate of Order V and without satisfying itself that why the 
summons could not be served and consequently, the Petitioner was 
never served in accordance with law. Therefore, obviously the 
limitation of thirty days cannot commence from the date of decree as 
it can only commence from attaining the knowledge of the ex-parte 
Judgment and Decree. In the instant case, the Petitioner attained the 
knowledge on 12.02.2021 when Respondents replied to his legal 
notice and informed him about the ex-parte Judgment and Decree. 
Thereafter, the application was filed on 27.02.2021 i.e. within a period 
of limitation.  
15. 
In the facts and circumstances of the case, it is 
disappointing for this Court that failure to adhere to the mandatory 
provisions with respect to service on the Petitioner through ordinary 
modes has caused colossal loss to both the parties as the Petitioner is 
entangled to litigation since the passing of Order of ex-parte 
proceedings, whereas, the Respondents are suffering on account of 
mistake committed by the learned Trial Court. 
16. 
The Revisional Court by reversing the Order passed by 
the Civil Court committed material irregularity as it failed to analyze 

Writ Petition No.70519 of 2022                                                  -9- 
 
 
the legal position that on account of non-adherence to the mandatory 
provisions of Order V of the CPC in relation to service through 
ordinary modes, the service upon the Petitioner through substituted 
mode was inconsequential. 
17. 
As a consequence of the above discussion, this Writ 
Petition is allowed and Impugned Order dated 26.08.2022 passed by 
the learned Revisional Court is set aside and as a result thereof the 
Order dated 09.12.2021 passed by the learned Civil Judge pursuant 
whereto the ex-parte Judgment and Decree was set aside,  is upheld.  
18. 
The parties are directed to appear before the learned 
District Judge, Faisalabad on 04.09.2023, who is directed to assign the 
matter to the Court of competent jurisdiction.
