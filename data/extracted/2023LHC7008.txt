ALI ZIA BAJWA, J.:- By dint of the instant 
Constitutional Petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of The 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter ‘the Constitution’) read with 
Section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter ‘Cr.P.C.’) 
the petitioner seeks recovery of the detenues namely Shahbaz Ali, Asim and 
Tahir Imran, from the illegal, improper and unauthorized custody of 
respondents No.3 & 4.  
2. 
Arguments heard and the record available on the file perused. 
3. 
After the filing of the instant petition, vide order dated 
04.12.2023, the Bailiff of this Court was deputed to recover the 
aforementioned detenues. In pursuance of that order, the Bailiff inspected 
the premises of Police Station Baghbanpura, Lahore where Shehbaz Ali 
detenue was found locked up in connection with the case FIR No.2171/2023, 
dated 02.05.2023, registered under Section 356 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 
1860 with the aforementioned police station. It was informed by the police 
officials that the rest of the two detenues were neither required in any

Writ Petition No.79470-H/2023 
 
criminal case nor they were in their custody. The Station Diary of the said 
police station was also produced before the Court, which reflected that 
although the arrest of Shahbaz Ali/detenue was incorporated therein but that 
Diary was maintained in sheer violation of Article 167 of the Police Order, 
2002 (hereinafter ‘the Order’) and the Punjab Police Rules, 1934 
(hereinafter ‘the Rules’). As the matter pertains to the life and liberty of the 
citizens, a notice was issued to the Inspector General of Police, Punjab to 
explain afore-stated state of affairs.  
4. 
 
Rule 22.45 of the Rules requires the maintenance of different 
registers at a Police Station. This Rule enlists 25 types of books to be 
maintained at the Police Station. The Station Diary or Daily Diary 
(hereinafter ‘Station Diary’) is mentioned at serial No.2 which is commonly 
known as “Roznamcha” and maintenance of the same is a matter under 
discussion. The Station Diary is the most significant document retained at a 
Police Station, which has been designed to keep a check on the enormous 
powers bestowed upon the police authorities. The Station Diary is 
maintained under Article 167 of the Order and Rules 48 & 49 of Chapter 22, 
Volume III of the Rules, Article 167 and Rules 22.48 have been provided as 
infra: -  
“167. Maintenance of Daily Diary at a police station.– (1) A register 
of Daily Diary shall be maintained at every police station in such form 
as shall, from time to time, be prescribed and to record therein the 
names of all complainants, persons arrested, the offences charged 
against them, the weapons or property that shall have been taken from 
their possession or otherwise, and the names of the witnesses who 
shall have been examined.  
(2) The District and Sessions Judge of the district may call for and 
inspect such Diary. 
22.48. Register No. II. - (1) The Daily Diary shall be maintained in 
accordance with section 44 of the Police Act. It shall be in Form 
22.48(1) and shall be maintained by means of carbon copying process. 
There shall be two copies. One will remain in the police station register 
and the other shall be despatched to a Gazetted Officer to be designated 
by the Superintendent of Police or to the Superintendent of Police 
himself every day at the hour fixed in this behalf.  
Shortly before the close of each quarter, books containing the proper 
number of pages for the ensuing three months shall be issued to police 
stations by the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall fix the hours at 
which station diaries shall be daily closed with reference to the hour of 
despatch of the post or messenger.  

3 
Writ Petition No.79470-H/2023 
 
(2)  The daily diary is intended to be complete record of all events 
which take place at the police station. It should, therefore, record not 
only the movements and activities of all police officers, but also visits of 
outsiders, whether official or non-official, coming or brought to the 
police station for any purpose whatsoever. 
(3) All entries in the station diary shall be made by the officer in charge 
of the police station or by the station clerk. Literate officers making a 
report shall read the report recorded and append their signatures. 
Every matter recorded in such diary shall be so recorded as soon as 
possible; each separate entry shall be numbered and the hour at which 
it was made shall commence each such entry. If the hour at which the 
information, or otherwise, containing such entries reaches the police 
station differs from the hour at which such entry was made, both hours 
shall be stated. As soon as entry has been made in the diary, a line shall 
be drawn across the page immediately below it. 
 (4) The opening entry each day shall give the name of each person in 
custody, the offence of which he is accused, and the date and hour of his 
arrest, the name of each accused person at large on bail or 
recognizance and the date of his release on such security.  
The last entry each day shall show (a) the balance of cash in hand as 
shown in the cash account, and (b) the balance of the cattle-pound 
account.” 
 
5. 
 
A Station Diary is a register required to be maintained to record 
day-to-day events that take place in a Police Station. Rule 22.49 of the Rules 
elaborates the matters to be entered in Station Diary. For effective 
monitoring of daily work schedules in a Police Station, to monitor such 
works in a regulated manner and to ensure that duties are discharged by the 
police officer as it would involve balancing the rights of people, be that of 
the accused or that of the victim of crimes or the society in general, said 
"Diary" is to be maintained at all Police Stations. The Station Diary is used 
to record every major and minor incident occurring within the jurisdiction of 
the Police Station in chronological order. Station Diary is the main record of 
the affairs of the Police Station and should contain everything of importance 
relating to the working of the Police Station. Some of the entries in the 
Station Diary are amplified and recorded in other books as well but all the 
important things must be entered in this book. The Station Diary is a 
chronological record of the happenings at the Police Station and for fixing 
the time of any particular action of the police, the entry in the Station Diary 
provides an important source of evidence. It ensures transparency and 
fairness in the proceedings carried out by the police officers relating to their 
duties in a Police Station. It rules out the arbitrariness and whimsical 
exercise of powers by a police officer.

Writ Petition No.79470-H/2023 
 
6. 
 
Details of information of cognizable offences or investigations 
already given in the First Information Book and the case diaries need not be 
reported in the Station Diary, but a gist of the information and a record of 
occurrences in the Police Station in connection with those cases, such as the 
receipt of information, the arrest of the accused persons, the production of a 
prisoner, the affecting of searches, seizures or the departure for or return 
from, of investigating officers, particulars such as identification parades and 
inspections held or attended, attendance at courts including submission of 
reports and charge sheets in the court, town patrols, assistance to officers of 
other Police Stations, etc., should be entered. 
7. 
 
In cases where the question of illegal detention of a person in 
police custody is involved, Station Diary is of utmost importance to 
determine the transparency and fairness in the process of arrest and 
detention. Any violation of statutory law that results in illegal arrest and 
detention shall also be violative of Articles 4, 9, 10, 10-A, 13 and 14 of the 
Constitution. Under Article 4 of the Constitution public functionaries 
including police are bound to act in good faith, honestly and within the 
precincts of their power so that persons concerned should be treated in 
accordance with law. Article 9 of the Constitution guarantees that no person 
would be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law; while 
Article 10 of the Constitution provides safeguards as to arrest and detention.1 
Article 10-A, which guarantees the right to have a fair trial to all citizens, 
also comes to rescue an arrested and detained person as it also applies to all 
the pre-trial proceedings including arrest and detention during an 
investigation. Articles 13 and 14 of the Constitution protect an accused 
against self-incrimination and torture. Any violation of law during the arrest 
and detention of a person would breach the constitutional guarantees and 
would lead to grave legal consequences.  
8. 
 
Maintenance of Station Diary in accordance with the relevant 
law goes a long way to provide a mechanism against illegal arrest and 
detention as ensured under the Constitution. Introducing any device to 
bypass the mandatory requirements of the Rules shall amount to 
disregarding the constitutional guarantees.  Through Notification No.

Writ Petition No.79470-H/2023 
 
43604/DIG/I.T dated 15-12-2017, issued by the Provincial Police Officer, 
Punjab with the approval of the Provincial Government, it was directed to 
make an Amendment in Rules 22.3 and 22.4 of the Rules. Through this 
Amendment in the Rules, in addition to the hard copy of the Police 
Registers, a soft copy (electronic copy) shall also be maintained. It has been 
observed by this Court that in a number of cases pertaining to arrest and 
detention, maintenance of computerized record of Station Diary is used as a 
tool to shield the illegalities committed by police officials.  
9. 
 
The cognizance was taken by the worthy Chief Justice of this 
Court in the case titled Mst. ASMAT PARVEEN vs. The STATE and another 
– PLD 2021 Lahore 105 and it was ruled that there is a pearl of wisdom 
underlying maintaining the manual Station Diary to rule out the possibility 
of any fabrication or alteration, which can easily be incorporated in the soft 
copy. It was further observed that in all eventualities a soft copy could never 
be a substitute for a manual record of police registers. It was directed to the 
Inspector General of Police, Punjab to maintain the manual record of Station 
Diary and in addition to that, a soft copy of the same shall also be prepared. 
Maintenance of a hard copy of the Station Diary is also indispensable as it 
can easily be produced before the Courts for examination to spotlight the 
illegalities committed by police officials. Examination of the soft copy of the 
entire record of Station Diary of a Police Station is also not convenient 
because any alteration or fabrication therein cannot be determined without a 
complete forensic analysis which might take extensive time. Leaving the 
scope of the power of Provincial Police Officer under Article 112 of the 
Order, regarding making an Amendment in the Rules, to be deliberated in 
some other appropriate case, it is observed that it shall be mandatory for the 
concerned police officials to maintain the manual copy of Station Diary and 
in addition to that a soft copy shall also be prepared.  A report on behalf of 
the Inspector General of Police, Punjab has been filed, which reflects that 
Station Diary, in every Police Station, shall be maintained in accordance 
with the Rules. The Station Diary shall also be maintained digitally in 
addition to its manual record. 
10. 
 
A self-explanatory procedure has been provided in Rules 22.48 
and 22.49 of the Rules regarding the maintenance of Station Diary, which 

6 
Writ Petition No.79470-H/2023 
 
further needs no elaboration.  However, I am persuaded to issue clear 
directions to the concerned police authorities regarding the maintenance of 
Station Diary, as infra: -  
I. 
In every Police Station, a Station Diary shall be maintained in 
accordance with Article 167 of the Order and Rules 22.48 & 
22.49 of the Rules. A strict adherence to the aforesaid 
provisions of law shall be ensured without further fail.  
II. 
Maintaining a computerized record of Station Diary is the need 
of the hour but the same cannot be permitted to be used to open 
a new venue to cover or legitimize the illegalities committed by 
the delinquent police officials, therefore, the computerized 
record of Station Diary shall be prepared in addition to the 
manual record. In case of any conflict between the two, the 
preference shall be given to the manual Station Diary.  
III. 
 Any wrong entry in the Station Diary by a police officer shall 
ordinarily entail his dismissal from the service as per Rule 
22.50 of the Rules. Zero tolerance in this regard should be 
shown by the supervisory officers and in case of failure on the 
part of the supervisory officer to do the needful, he shall be 
accountable for the same. 
IV. 
Properly printed books, to maintain the Station Diary, 
containing the proper number of pages, should be issued to 
every Police Station by the concerned Superintendent of Police. 
Only duly issued books shall be used for maintaining the 
Station Diary to rule out the possibility of any fabrication and 
alteration in the same. A Station Diary without page numbers 
creates room for modification and alteration.  
V. 
Wrong entries in the Station Diary should be scored out by 
means of a single line and initialed by a Senior Police Officer 
and in no case any such wrong entry be mutilated or rendered 
illegal nor should paper be pasted over it.  

7 
Writ Petition No.79470-H/2023 
 
VI. 
A District and Sessions Judge of every District may call for and 
inspect the Station Diaries of Police Stations in his district 
occasionally to ensure that those are maintained following the 
law in its letter and spirit. This power under Article 167(2) of 
the Order should be exercised regularly to keep a check on the 
proper maintenance of Station Diary.  
11. 
As the arrest of one of the alleged detenues, namely Shahbaz 
Ali, has been regulated under the relevant law, therefore, learned counsel for 
the petitioner does not press this petition to his extent and wishes to avail the 
remedy before the appropriate forum. A report regarding the rest of the 
alleged detenues namely Asim Shafique and Tahir Imran has been filed by 
the SHO Police Station Baghbanpura, Lahore, which reflects that neither 
they are in police custody nor required in any criminal case, therefore, it 
shall be appropriate to refer the matter to the concerned Superintendent of 
Police (Operations), who shall do the needful after hearing all the concerned 
in accordance with the law. With the aforesaid observations, this writ 
petition stands disposed of.   
12. 
 
Office shall send a copy of this Judgment to the Inspector 
General of Police, Punjab for onward circulation to all the Police Stations in 
the province of Punjab for information and strict compliance.
