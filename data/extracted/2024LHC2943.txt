This consolidated order shall decide I.C.A. 
Nos.85, 86, 87 and 88 of 2024 as similar questions 
of law and facts are involved in all the appeals filed 
on behalf of National Bank of Pakistan, however, 
for brevity facts of this appeal have been recorded 
for reaching the conclusion in the matter. 
2. 
 Through this Intra Court Appeal, appellants 
have called in question order dated 09.05.2024 
passed by learned Single Judge of this Court 
whereby 
constitution 
petition 
filed 
by 
the 
respondent was allowed and impugned order dated 
11.12.2023 declining promotion to the respondent 
was set aside and present appellants were directed 
to proceed in the matter and reconsider the case of 
the respondent on its own merits and in the light of 
judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan mentioned 
in the said order. 
3. 
Perusal of the record shows that through writ 
petition, respondent (petitioner therein) challenged 
the order dated 11.12.2023 passed by appellants 
(respondents therein) whereby appeal of the 
respondent addressed to President, National Bank 
of Pakistan was decided and relief to the respondent 

 
I.C.A. No.85 of 2024 
2 
 
was declined, operative part of which is reproduced 
below: 
 
“This Speaking Order is issued to you in 
compliance of the Court Order dated 14.06.2023, 
passed by the Hon’ble Lahore High Court Multan 
Bench, Multan in W.P. No.9740 of 2023, filed by you 
on the captioned subject. You had sought promotion 
under Promotion Policy dated 28.10.2016. 
 
The relevant para of the Order is reproduced 
as under: 
 
“In view of the above, respondent No. 1 
(President, 
National 
Bank 
of 
Pakistan, 
I.I. 
Chundrigarh Road, Karachi) is directed to decide 
the afore-referred appeal filed by the petitioner, if 
pending, either himself or through some authorized 
officer, in accordance with law, after providing an 
opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and the 
others concerned, expeditiously, preferably within a 
period of 30-days from the date of receipt of certified 
copy of this order. With this direction, the instant 
constitutional petition stands disposed of.”  
 
In compliance of above-mentioned Court 
Order you were provided opportunity of personal 
hearing on 23.11 2025 at 3:30 p.m. by committee 
comprising of senior executives duly constituted by 
the President.” 
 
….. 
….. 
 
“CONCLUSION In view of the aforementioned 
facts, your case of promotion from AVP to VP from 
retrospective date is declined being devoid of 
merit.” 
 
 
(emphasis supplied) 
 
 
4. 
The learned counsel for the appellants has 
been confronted with question of maintainability of 
this Intra Court Appeal and he has vehemently tried 
to convince us of its maintainability, however, as 
the order dated 11.12.2013 passed on behalf of the 
President, 
National 
Bank 
of 
Pakistan 
on 
respondent’s appeal was challenged through the 
constitution petition which has been decided 
through 
impugned 
order 
dated 
09.05.2024, 
therefore, proviso to subsection (2) of Section 3 of 
The Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972, reproduced 
below would be applicable for determining whether 
or not this Intra Court Appeal is maintainable. 
 
“(2) An appeal shall also lie to a Bench of 
two or more Judges of a High Court from an order 

 
I.C.A. No.85 of 2024 
3 
 
made by a single Judge of that Court under clause 
(1) of Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan not being an order made under 
sub- paragraph (i) of paragraph (b) of that clause : 
 
Provided that the appeal referred to in this 
sub-section shall not be available or competent if the 
application brought before the High Court under 
Article 199 arises out of any proceedings in which 
the law applicable provided for at least one appeal 
or one revision or one review to any court, tribunal 
or authority against the original order.” 
 
5. 
The question relating to maintainability of 
Intra Court Appeal in terms of proviso to subsection 
(2) of Section 3 of Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 
came up for consideration in the case of “Mst. 
Karim Bibi and others v. Hussain Bakhsh and 
another” (PLD 1984 SC 344) wherein Supreme 
Court of Pakistan has held that where there is at 
least one appeal against the original order, in the 
proceedings, then no appeal would be competent 
from the order of a single judge in constitutional 
jurisdiction. Meaning thereby that the test is 
whether the original order, passed in the 
proceedings was subject to an appeal under the 
relevant law, irrespective of the fact as to whether 
the remedy of appeal was availed or not by a party. 
A similar view was rendered by the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in the case “Muhammad Abdullah v. 
Deputy 
Settlement 
Commissioner, 
Centre-I, 
Lahore” (PLD 1985 SC 107) wherein the said 
Court again reiterated the principle laid down in the 
Karim Bibi case (supra) and held that Intra Court 
Appeal was not competent because the law 
provided for an appeal against the original order. In 
recent judgment of Supreme Court of Pakistan 
“International 
Islamic 
University, 
Islamabad 
through Rector and another Vs. Syed Naveed Altaf 
and others” (2024 SCMR 472), the Supreme Court 
of Pakistan upheld the order of High Court 

 
I.C.A. No.85 of 2024 
4 
 
declaring 
the 
Intra 
Court 
Appeal 
as 
not 
maintainable due to availability of appeal against 
the original order by observing that where decision 
is made by Single Judge of High Court in 
proceedings under challenge through constitution 
petition, the essential requirement to invoke the 
proviso to section 3(2) of the Law Reforms 
Ordinance for determination of maintainability of 
Intra Court Appeal is to see whether the remedy of 
at least one appeal, review or revision is available 
under the law against the original order. 
6. 
The principles laid down in the afore-referred 
cases are applicable to this Intra Court Appeal as 
well which has been filed against order dated 
09.05.2024 passed by learned Single Judge of this 
Court whereby order dated 11.12.2023 passed by 
the National Bank of Pakistan declining the claim 
of respondent for promotion on his appeal was set 
aside and the appellants were directed to consider 
the case of the respondent for promotion in view of 
the principles laid down by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case referred to by the learned 
Single Judge in his judgment, hence, in view of 
proviso to Section 3(2) of the Law Reforms 
Ordinance, 1972 and the principles laid down in 
afore-referred judgments of the Supreme Court, this 
Intra Court Appeal, against order of Single Judge 
whereby order passed by the National Bank of 
Pakistan in respondent’s appeal was set aside, is not 
maintainable and this appeal as well as afore-
mentioned connected appeals are accordingly 
dismissed.
