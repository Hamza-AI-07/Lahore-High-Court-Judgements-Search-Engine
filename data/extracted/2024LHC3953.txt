These petitions, instituted under section 
11 of the Punjab Undesirable Cooperative Societies Act, 1993 (“the 
Act 1993”), impugn the consolidated judgment of 01.10.2021, by the 
Judicial Officer, Punjab Cooperative Board for Liquidation (“the 
Judicial Officer”), which had annulled transaction of disposal / sale 
of land measuring 26-Kanals and 18-Marla situated at Chak No. 
212/RB, 
Railway 
Road, 
Faisalabad 
(“the 
property”), 
and 
consequently ordered cancellation of three sale deeds executed in 
favour of the petitioners [to the extent of land measuring 20-Kanals 
and 08 Marlas]. 
 
Narration of facts: 
2.  
Facts essential for deciding instant petitions are that National 
Industrial Cooperative Finance Corporation (NICFC) owned the 
property, which property became vested in Punjab Cooperatives 

Board for Liquidation (in short “the Cooperatives Board”) by virtue 
of the Act, 1993. The Cooperatives Board assumed authority and 
acted as statutory liquidator over wound-up undesirable cooperative 
societies. By law, the Cooperatives Board was empowered to dispose 
of assets and property(ies) of undesirable societies, including the 
property. Funds generated through sale of assets / properties are 
utilized for satisfying the liabilities of undesirable societies through 
payments to claimants against verified claims. The Cooperatives 
Board embarked upon the process of public auction of the properties 
through advertisement. And for the information of prospective 
bidders, details of the properties and terms of auction were published 
in “Daily Jang, Lahore” on 05.03.2003. The property, subject matter 
of instant proceedings, was listed at serial 17 of the advertisement. 
For ease of reference the terms of auction read as follows,

For the purposes of lis at hand, attempt to auction failed 
when single bid was received and quoted price was less than the 
base value of the property, procured through evaluation. No reserve 
price was mentioned in the advertisement but it transpired from the 
minutes of the meeting of 30.10.2003, that assessed value of the 
property was Rs.269,500,000/- and in said meeting decision was 
taken to get the property re-assessed, on the premise that value 
assessed was on the higher side. Whether the property was re-
assessed or not? No details are available and nor any reference was 
made during hearing(s).  
  
In February 2004, Niagra Mills (Pvt) Limited – (the “first 
petitioner”), approached the Chairman Cooperatives Board, through 
letter dated 18.02.2004, and showed interest in purchasing the 
property. And willingness matured into offer in writing for 

Rs.221,000,000/-, through letter of 25.02.2004, accompanied with 
security deposit receipt of Rs.500,000/-. 
3.  
 On 22.03.2004, evidently, bidding was arranged amongst 
three bidders, which exercise culminated upon offering of 
Rs.275,100,000/- by the first petitioner – [the „highest bid‟]. The 
highest bid was approved by the Cooperatives Board in meeting 
dated 24.03.2004 in favour of the first petitioner. It appeared that 
vide letter of 13 April 2004, first petitioner claimed to have had 
deposited 25% of the bid price, upon indicating accompanying 
instrument of Rs.41,265,000/-, who sought extension of 120 days 
for making payment of Rs.206,325,000/- [75% of the bid price]. No 
objection certificates („NOCs‟) were issued on 05.07.2004 – three 
NOCs were issued to the nominees of the first petitioner [successful 
bidder]. Sale deeds, respectively in the name of the nominees, were 
executed on 05.07.2004 –cumulatively to the extent of land 
measuring 20-Kanals & 08-Marlas. Record depicts that on 17th 
March 2008, the Cooperatives Board demanded payment of 
Rs.63,303,458/-, inclusive of liquidation charges – wherein it was 
acknowledged that sum of Rs.217,298,542/- was received till then 
along 2% liquidation charges. Letter indicated reference to letters 
addressed to successful bidders regarding some litigation against 

part of the property. Record showed that successful bidder tendered 
instrument of Rs.47,960,752/-, committing that difference, if any 
would be paid subject to measurement of available land. A criminal 
case was registered, bearing F.I.R No. 15/2014 dated 23.04.2014, 
against petitioners and Cooperatives Board‟s ex-management, 
which ended in acquittal of the petitioners vide judgement dated 
26.03.2018 by Special Judge Anti-Corruption Faisalabad. It appears 
that the Cooperatives Board took possession of the land measuring 
06-Kanals & 10-Marlas in or about November 2017. The 
Cooperatives Board, , through Secretary, brought action for seeking 
cancelation of alleged transaction of sale, NOCs and sale deeds of 
land measuring 20-Kanals & 08 Marlas, on 16.02.2018. And 
contemporaneously, the first petitioner also instituted suit seeking 
declaration and mandatory injunction and transfer of remaining land 
of 06-Kanals & 10-Marlas. Both the proceedings were consolidated; 
issues were framed, and evidence led. Judicial Officer passed the 
order against the petitioners. Matter is adjudicated in view of 
aforesaid stated facts. 
Submissions: 
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners questioned the authority 
of the Judicial Officer to exercise jurisdiction on the premise that 

enactment conferred powers on the Cooperatives Board, which 
powers cannot be further delegated to the Judicial Officer. In 
precise, the objection is that assumption of jurisdiction by the 
Judicial Officer is contrary to the mandate of law. It is asserted that 
Judicial Officer had no authority to act as Court, in the absence of 
statutory sanction and that tantamount to offend Article 175 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.  Learned 
counsel banked on the doctrine of res-judicata; and elaborates that 
once disposal of the property by way of negotiated sale was 
approved by the Cooperatives Board, and NOCs were issued, 
followed by execution of sale deeds, transaction of sale became 
past and closed transaction, which cannot be re-opened, let alone 
after 14 years. In brief, principle of finality of the decision is 
pleaded. Learned counsel emphasized that competitive bidding 
took place, and first petitioner was declared as the highest bidder, 
whose 
bid 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Cooperatives 
Board, 
unconditionally. Adds that factum of piecemeal payment or delay, 
if any, was inconsequential since the Cooperatives Board had 
neither transferred complete chunk of land, nor did it possess the 
land till 2017. And land measuring 6-Kanals and 10-Marlas is still 
not transferred. Learned counsel elaborated that subsequent to the 
execution of sale deeds, the Cooperatives Board got registered a 

criminal case against the petitioners and ex-management, wherein 
petitioners were acquitted on 26.03.2018, which acquittal is 
sufficient to dismiss allegations of fraudulent, collusive and 
deceptive sale. And, thereafter, the Cooperatives Board had no 
authority to seek re-opening of sale transaction, which stood 
finalized for all intent and purposes. It is argued that the Judicial 
Officer had no authority to cancel registered sale deeds, which 
power exclusively vests in the Civil Court and remedy is available 
in terms of section 39 of the Specific Relief Act 1877. Learned 
counsel draw support from following decisions, reported as 
“Telecard 
Limited 
through 
Authorized 
representative 
Vs. 
Pakistan 
Telecommunication Authority through Chairman” (2014 CLD 415), 
“Muhammad Ashraf Khan and 2 others Vs. Muhammad Khan and 9 others” 
(2004 CLC 1133), “Amir Jamal and others Vs. Malik Zaho0or-ul-Haq and 
others” (2011 SCMR 1023), “Muhammad Ashraf Tiwana and others Vs. 
Pakistan and others” (2013 SCMR 1159), “S.M. Waseem Ashraf Vs. 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, M/O Housing and Works, 
Islamabad and others” (2013 SCMR 338), “Administrator, Thal 
Development through EACO Bhakkar and others Vs. Ali Muhammad (2012 
SCMR 730), “Nawab Syed Raunaq Ali, etc. Vs. Chief Settlement

Trading Estate Ltd through Managing Director and 2 others” (2003 YLR 
1760), “Punjab Cooperative Board of Liquidation through Chairman Vs. 
Muhammad Ilyas” (PLD 2014 SC 471) and “Muhammad Hayat and 6 others 
Vs. Muhammad Nawaz (1971 SCMR 414). 
5. 
Conversely, 
learned 
counsel 
appearing 
for 
the 
Cooperatives Board submits that power of delegation is 
specifically provided in the statute. Further submits that 
principle of finality / conclusiveness is not attracted since 
transaction was not completed, and otherwise no finality could 
be claimed in wake of fraudulent sale, which vitiates 
everything. Submits that ex-management acted illegally and 
without 
appreciating 
material 
irregularities, 
which 
surreptitiously approved sale against ridiculously low price and 
on shady terms. Submits that no question of limitation arises in 
terms of clause (f) of section 7 of the Act, 1993. On facts, it is 
alleged that failure to hold public auction was fatal and once 
advertisement was issued there was no option for sale through 
private treaty, subsequently. Learned counsel cites decisions 
reported as “MALIK MUHAMMAD ASHRAF. VS.  DIRECTOR EXCISE AND 
TAXATION, MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION AUTHORITY, Islamabad” 

(2017 YLR 1136), “CH. LATIF AKBAR, FORMER FINANCE MINISTER, 
AZAD GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE OF JAMMU AND KASHMIR 
MUZAFFARABAD and 8 others. Vs. AZAD GOV ERNMENT OF THE STATE 
JAMMU AND KASHMIR through Chief Secretary and 10 others.” (PLD 2017 
High Court (AJ&K) 32)”. 
6. 
Heard. Record perused. 
Determination: 
7. 
Historically viewed, the episode started with approval of sale 
of the property through private treaty / negotiated sale and ended 
upon the decision of annulment of transaction of sale by the Judicial 
Officer – the sticking point is whether power to annual the sale 
vests in the Judicial Officer and if transaction under reference could 
be re-opened or re-visited by the Cooperatives Board, after lapse of 
14 years.  
  
Upon hearing learned counsel following issues / questions 
are found relevant for the purposes of determination, within the 
scope of jurisdiction extended under section 11 of the Act, 1993.  
(1)  
What is the scope of jurisdiction under section 11 of the 
Act, 1993? 
(2)  
What is the status of the Judicial Officer? and the scope / 
nature of the authority extended / exercisable?   

(3)  
Whether transaction for disposal of the property could be 
reconsidered once sale deed(s) were executed? [Petition was 
submitted 14 years after grant of approval by the Cooperatives 
Board] – Is the doctrine of past and closed transaction(s) 
attracted.  
(4)  
Whether the concept of finality / conclusiveness admits an 
exception in liquidation matters under the Act, 1993? In and 
under what circumstances defence of res-judicata is not available 
to the beneficiary(ies) of sale, not through public auction but 
private treaty? 
(5) 
Whether Judicial Officer is empowered to cancel 
registered instruments [the sale deeds] or Civil Court(s) have the 
requisite jurisdiction. 
(6)  
What is the effect of order of acquittal of the accused 
persons – beneficiaries of the sale - in case FIR No.15/14. 
(7)  
Conclusion. 
  
[Determination of issues in sequential pattern hereby follows] 
What is the scope of jurisdiction under section 11 of the 
Act, 1993? 
8. 
Jurisdiction conferred under section 11 of the Act, 1993 is 
restricted to confirm, reverse or modify the act or decision 
complained. Section 11 of the Act, 1993 refers to the action / 
decision of the Cooperatives Board, Chairman or delegatee thereof, 
which indicates acknowledgment of the authority of the delegatee – 

the Judicial Officer. It is expedient to reproduce section 11 of the 
Act 1993, which reads as,  
11.   Application to the Cooperatives Judge.– A person if 
aggrieved by an act or decision of the Cooperatives Board, 
may [including the Chairman or his delegate may within a 
period of sixty days from the date of the act or decision] apply 
to the Cooperatives Judge, who may confirm, reverse, or 
modify the act or decision complained against, and make such 
order as he may think just in the circumstances of the case. 
[Emphasis added] 
  
Provision though not ideally worded but intent is evident 
upon reference to the delegatee of the Cooperatives Board, in 
context of Cooperatives Board‟s composition prescribed in law.  
  
Jurisdiction exercised by the Co-operative Judge, being 
„persona designata‟, is not to be confused with the extent and 
breadth of judicial review jurisdiction. Co-operative Judge cannot 
determine or decide qua the constitutionality of any provision of 
law or declare it ultra-vires or give declaration of intra-vires, but 
nevertheless same is empowered to examine, adjudicate and 
determine the legality of any action or decision of the Cooperatives 
Board, including the Judicial Officer. In the context of present 
case, legality of transaction of sale of the property and validity of 
the decision of the Judicial Officer are subject matter issues and 
requisite jurisdiction is available. Jurisdiction assumed is in line 

with the parameters defined in the case of “Punjab Cooperative Board 
of Liquidation through Chairman Vs. Muhammad Ilyas” (PLD 2014 S.C 
471), wherein section 11 of the Act, 1993 was interpreted, whereby 
the scope of remedy was defined, and it was held that Cooperatives 
Board cannot agitate or vent grievance against the order of the 
Judicial Officer. Whether the delegator could object to the decision 
of the delegatee – this question is amplified while dealing with the 
next issue. I proceed to decide other issues. 
What is the status of the Judicial Officer, scope and extent 
of authority extended / exercisable?  
9. 
In essence, Judicial Officer is an alter-ego of the 
Cooperatives Board, authorized to exercise the authority of 
Cooperatives Board, i.e., „power of determination of rights and 
obligations of the persons, in the context of scheme of law - there 
is a rational in the nomenclature „the Judicial Officer‟. Evidently, 
the distinction between the powers retained by the Cooperatives 
Board, and those delegated to the Judicial Officer is the key to 
understanding and resolution of the controversy. The Cooperatives 
Board, a body corporate, is the creature of a statute – section 5 of 
the Act, 1993. In addition to the powers exercisable by a 
Liquidator, under the Cooperatives Societies Act 1925, specific 

powers are extended in terms of section 7 of the Act 1993 to the 
Cooperatives Board and its delegatee(s). Enactment extended 
powers to the Cooperatives Board to perform functions, discharge 
duties and enforce the obligations prescribed. The Cooperatives 
Board is empowered, by the legislature, to appoint official(s) for 
efficient performance of its functions under clause (r) of section 7 
of the Act, 1993. Likewise, the Cooperatives Board is empowered 
to delegate any of its powers to any official and others in terms of 
clause (s) of section 7 of the Act, 1993. Appointment and 
delegation of powers upon the Judicial Officer is clear 
manifestation of the powers conferred under clauses (r) and (s), of 
section 7 of the Act, respectively. Argument that Judicial Officer 
cannot exercise powers, being delegatee of the Cooperatives 
Board, fails to appreciate the mandate of the law and specificity of 
power of delegation. It is pertinent to mention that powers 
conferred upon and exercised by the Judicial Officer – though an 
alter-ego / delegatee of the Cooperatives Board - are in the nature 
of quasi-judicial powers, distinguishable from the jurisdiction 
conferred and exercised by the Courts. Scope and extent of quasi-
judicial jurisdiction is explained in the case of “Government of the 
Punjab through Secretary, Schools Education Department, Lahore 
and others Vs. Abdur Rehman and others” (2022 SCMR 25). It is 

reiterated that in wake of specific empowerment / authorization by 
the legislature to the Cooperatives Board, qua appointing an officer 
and to delegate powers to said delegatee / officer, doctrine of 
delegatus non potest delegare is not attracted. And decisions 
referred by learned counsel for the petitioners are distinguishable, 
which do not address the proposition where power of delegation 
was provided in the law. 
  
Power extended to the Judicial Officer, to act as delegatee of 
the Cooperatives Board, are not in the category of delegation of 
legislative powers. Notwithstanding conferment of quasi-judicial 
powers, the Judicial Officer cannot claim attributes and features of 
the Court. Performance of quasi-judicial functions by itself does 
not convert the Authority or Tribunal into a Court. Reference is 
made to the decision in the case of “Shafaatullah Qureshi Vs. 
Federation of Pakistan” (PLD 2001 Supreme Court 142). A 
forum / body exercising quasi-judicial powers is not obligated to 
strictly apply or follow the procedural law regime strictly – See the 
case of “S.A. Jameel Vs. Secretary to the Government of the 
Punjab, Cooperative Department and others” (2005 SCMR 126). 
Likewise, stringent application of principle of finality of decisions, 
as applicable qua the legal determinations by the Courts of law, is 

not attracted with respect to the actions and decisions of the 
Cooperatives Board – previous approval of the Board to approve 
sale has to be examined in the context of distinctive attributes of 
quasi-judicial forum(s) and Courts and exceptions thereto in the 
context of scope of relevant enactment. Scope of powers conferred 
and exercisable by quasi-judicial forum(s) are respectively defined, 
which vary in the context of relevant law(s) and no fixed 
principles, relating to finality of decisions, could be applied in 
omnibus fashion. Summed up, status of the Judicial Officer is that 
of an agent, albeit an officer authorized by the Cooperatives Board 
to act as its delegatee, to exercise the power of determination qua 
the rights claimed and statutory obligations ought to be enforced. 
This peculiar situation in the context of delegation of powers, 
though with different nomenclatures / official designation(s), was 
subject of discussion in the case of “Commissioner of Income-Tax, 
East Pakistan, DACCA Vs. Wahiduzzaman” (PLD 1965 Supreme 
Court 171),  where the Apex Court discussed the status of the 
Income Tax Officer qua the Income Tax Commissioner and 
observed that „the position of the Income-tax Officer is not that of 
Judicial Tribunal deciding the matter between two contending 
parties, but rather that of a person acting on behalf of the 

department who is charged with the duty of seeing that persons pay 
the amount of income-tax to which they are in fact liable‟. 
  
In the same vein, Judicial Officer is the delegatee of the 
Cooperatives Board, which is inter alia exercising delegated 
powers, including power to see if the transaction of sale is carried 
out in accordance with the law, and jurisprudence settled through 
judicial pronouncements in the context of sale through public 
auction, instead of negotiated / private treaty sales. I am unable to 
decipher any statutory bar or limitation qua the authority of the 
Cooperatives Board to reconsider its previous decision or action, in 
the context of allegation of fraud attributed to it. Decision or action 
of the Cooperatives Board, qua grant of approval in the context of 
present case, is a specie of reconsideration / re-assessment of 
earlier decision, in the context of specific allegations. And 
reconsidered opinion / re-assessment of the Cooperatives Board, 
when examined and considered by the Judicial Officer, on request, 
is a different ball game – this is the exercise of power of 
determination 
delegated 
to 
the 
Judicial 
Officer, 
which, 
undisputedly, is the power of the Cooperatives Board but 
delegated. This power of determination is acknowledged by law - 
in the context of reference to the delegatee in section 11 of the Act, 

1993. Enactment, in absence of specific bar, envisages process of 
self-correction by the Cooperatives Board, internally and without 
outside help, when encountered with any unwarranted action or 
wrong decision – fraudulent sale for the purposes of these petitions. 
Any other interpretation, assuming principle of finality of the 
decision of the Cooperatives Board, would push the Cooperatives 
Board in blind alley – a cul-de-sac situation. The Cooperatives 
Board, when aggrieved of its action, likely to prejudice rights of 
any party, is entitled to raise question touching rights of the parties 
involved before the Judicial Officer; and Judicial Officer in such 
situation is required to exercise quasi-judicial powers, subject to 
the limitations and legal constraints and exceptions in the context 
of principles of finality, evolved, decision by decision. In terms of 
the ratio laid in the case of “Muhammad Ilyas” (supra), the 
Cooperatives Board or Chairman cannot avail the remedy of 
section 11 of the Act, 1993 against the order of the Judicial Officer, 
but an aggrieved party / person can. The delegator, i.e., the 
Cooperatives Board, could object to the decision of the delegatee – 
the Judicial Officer. This is the rational and sprit of the Act, 1993 – 
and letter of the law reaffirmed the legislative intent. Petitioners 
misconstrued the position of the Judicial Officer. Judicial Officer 
and the Cooperatives Board are not mutually exclusive entity(ies) 

in the context of division of powers, though former being the alter-
ego of latter, but upon distribution, powers available with the 
Cooperatives Board and those delegated may be termed mutually 
exclusive, for the purposes of achieving the objectives and purpose 
of the law. Section 11 of the Act, 1993 acknowledges the status of 
delegatee, in the context of exercise of delegated power, that is the 
power of determination of rights claimed against the Cooperatives 
Board.  
  
There is another angle to it. How petitioners could object to 
the factum of delegation and assumption of jurisdiction by the 
Judicial Officer when the first petitioner had approached the 
delegatee by instituting petition seeking various reliefs. Hence, 
objection to the jurisdiction, post-adverse order, is devoid of bona 
fides and otherwise offensive to the doctrine of acquiescence / 
estoppel. 
Whether transaction for disposal of the property could be 
reconsidered once sale deed(s) were executed? [Petition 
was submitted 14 years after grant of approval by the 
Cooperatives Board] – Is the doctrine of past and closed 
of transaction(s) attracted. 

10.  
Learned counsel for petitioners objected to the assumption of 
jurisdiction by the Judicial Officer on the premise that sale 
transaction, subject matter of sale deeds, was a concluded matter, 
which cannot be re-opened after lapse of 14 years. Argument is 
inherently flawed for two primary reasons. Firstly, sale approved 
on 22.03.2004 is still incomplete – land measuring 06-Kanals & 
10-Marlas is not yet transferred. This provides continuing cause of 
action. Successful bidder had itself sought enforcement of part 
performance. Hence, plea of past and closed transaction is patently 
misconceived.  
  
Secondly, there is no barring provision in the Act, 1993 that 
restricts the Cooperatives Board from re-visiting transaction of sale 
upon evidence regarding collusive assistance of ex-management in 
supporting 
sale, 
otherwise 
replete 
with 
illegalities 
and 
irregularities, establishing conspicuous fraud, from start to the end. 
How could irreversibility of a fraudulent action or decision be 
blocked. Is this logical. Law, to survive, has to be logical. Option 
of reconsideration of fraudulent act cannot be obstructed – scope of 
authority of the Cooperatives Board was elucidated in previous 
paragraph.  Fraud vitiates and nullifies sale, admitting no objection 
regarding limitation, finality of decision or plea of past and closed 

transaction. Extent of applicability of doctrine of res-judicata has 
to be examined in the context of peculiar circumstances and scope 
of duties and responsibilities assigned to the Cooperatives Board, 
being fiduciary-cum-trustee of the claimants [affectees of 
cooperative societies‟ fraud]. Effect of incidence of fraud, in the 
context of doctrine of res-judicata is examined in latter paragraphs.  
11. 
Seriousness of the request of the Cooperatives Board, to the 
Judicial Officer, seeking reconsideration of transaction of sale, 
despite grant of approval previously by the then management, 
depends upon the fact that how potently, effectively and 
convincingly the elements of fraud and deception are established. 
Brief recapitulation of the facts, proving fraud, is essential to 
highlight prejudicial procedural lapses, substantive flaws and 
instances of fraudulent / deceptive and surreptitious conduct, 
throughout. Most fatal factor was holding of negotiated sale 
through private treaty, without any advertisement. Element of 
competitiveness, which is ensured through Public auction, was 
lacking. No approval was procured for sale through private treaty. 
No pre-sale approval of the Cooperatives Board was procured, 
settling the terms and conditions of sale – conventionally followed 
and one of the material condition of prescribing time for payment 

of 75% of bid price was missing and concession was abused to the 
extent that even after lapse of more than three years 75% of bid 
price remained unpaid. Sale was approved, two days after so-called 
bidding, by the Cooperatives Board and no discussion qua conduct 
of negotiated bidding and terms and conditions of sale was held – 
one liner approval exposed whatever credibility qua sale was 
claimed. Restricted bidding amongst three bidders was carried out 
[one of them had shown inclination to purchase property through 
letter in February 2004, there was no revelation that how other two 
participants got clue of conduct of negotiated sale]. There was no 
explanation or reasoning that why the mechanism of public auction 
was abandoned and instead process of negotiated sale was adopted 
– what prompted the then management to take paradigm shift: 
abandoning mechanism of public auction in the midstream and 
alternatively preferring sale by private treaty. It is apparent from 
the terms of previous advertisement that property would be 
transferred upon payment of full bid amount, which condition was 
flouted while conducting subject matter negotiated sale. Sale deeds 
were executed on the instructions of successful bidder, in the 
names of the nominees, on 05.07.2004 without ensuring payment 
of 75% of bid price. There was no explanation that why was this 
concession extended to successful bidder? Excuse put forward by 

the petitioners that some litigation was pending, and full payment 
was delayed since the Cooperatives Board did not have the 
possession, and otherwise not ready to transfer the remaining land 
of 6-Kanals and 10-Marlas, may have had relevance with respect to 
voluntary sales, between willing buyer and seller, but not in 
matters, where statutory liquidators / public authorities are tasked 
to sell public assets / properties. There was no justification for 
extending time for payment of 75% bid price. Was this concession 
agreed as one of the condition of sale? Non-payment of 75% of bid 
price even stretched beyond three years, though sale deeds were 
procured within three months of the approval by the Cooperatives 
Board.  
  
There is another aspect. Segregation of the property into 
unencumbered or encumbered category was neither agreed nor 
forming part of sale transaction. Facility of allowing extension qua 
payment was exclusive for the successful bidder, and other bidders 
were neither privy to such concession nor such condition was 
disclosed at the time of bidding. Plea and concept of partial 
enforcement of sale is alien to public sales. In the context of an 
unconcluded transaction, the Cooperatives Board is entitled to seek 
re-opening of fraudulent sale, which is not functus officio, and no 

such state of redundancy was envisaged upon purposive reading of 
the Act, 1993. Doctrine of functus officio is attracted once the 
matter / task has been finalized and accomplished and not 
otherwise. Principle of functus officio was discussed in the case of 
“Kh. Muhammad Fazil Vs. Mumtaz Munawar Khan Niazi 
(deceased) through L.Rs and another” (2024 SCMR 1059), and 
application whereof was qualified till the task is finalized or 
accomplished. Question of fraud was not subject matter of the facts 
involved in said case. In instant case approval was extended by the 
then management and determination of legality of approval, in the 
capacity of quasi-judicial authority, by the delegatee was not 
pleaded or involved. Whether doctrine of functus officio could 
apply to the Judicial Officer? This question has to be examined in 
the context of facts of each case and may not be relevant for the 
purposes of present controversy, which question and will be 
decided in any other case, involved and raised. 
12. 
I take up the plea of doctrine of res-judicata – which is the 
subject of issue at serial (4). Restrictions in terms of section 11 of 
Code of Civil Procedure 1908 have had to be read and interpreted 
with reference to the Court. The Cooperatives Board is competent 
to seek reconsideration of approval to sale. The Cooperatives 

Board is not the Court, hence not obligated to adhere to the 
provisions of the Evidence Act and Code of Civil Procedure or 
subject to constraints provided therein. “Bhag Mal Vs. Muhammad 
Sharif and 2 others” (1991 SCMR 2118), relevant portion is 
reproduced hereunder, 
“This Court while holding that the Settlement authorities do 
hold quasi-judicial proceedings, have not clothed them with the 
status of “Courts” so as to apply the provisions of the Evidence 
Act or C.P.C. to the proceedings before them except to the 
extent permitted / specified by the law. See Dr. Niaz 
Muhammad Mann v. Sh. Muhammad Ahmad (1988 SCMR 
1016); Nawab Din v. Member, Board of Revenue (Settlement 
and Rehabilitation) Punjab, Lahore and 4 others (PLD 1979 
SC 846).”  
13.  
Doctrine of res-judicata is not applicable with such 
strictness, as applied with respect to judicial decisions by the 
Courts, but nonetheless, general principles in the context of 
administration of justice needed consideration, which principles are 
discussed in the case of „WAHIDUSZAMAN (supra), relevant 
portion is reproduced hereunder,  
“Having examined the decision of the Appellate 
Assistant Commissioner proceed to consider the 
principle applicable for determining the bar which may 
be created by a previous decision of an Income-tax 
Authority. Where there is no statutory provision barring 
reopening of a matter the applicability of the principle 
of res judicata depends on the necessity of giving 
finality to litigation and the injustice of vexing a person 
twice in respect of the same matter and these being only 
general considerations relating to administration of 
justice with no technical and defined limits the 
applicability of res judicata in such cases will be 

governed by considerations arising with respect to the 
particular statute under which a matter has been 
determined the dominant consideration always being 
that the cause of justice be advanced. The principle of 
res judicata can be applied with strictness to cases 
before Courts or before Judicial Tribunals where there 
are before the Court or Tribunal two contesting parties 
each trying to substantiate its own case……….”  
14. 
No constraints are available in law to restrict the 
Cooperatives 
Board 
from 
reconsidering 
the 
transaction, 
manifesting fraudulent conduct and deceptive silence. Though 
unnecessary to indicate but reference to established jurisprudence 
is must; Fraud is an exception to the doctrine of res-judicata. Right 
of review of any order / decision of the Court or quasi-judicial 
tribunal is not available in the absence of statutory provision but 
cases of fraud, mala fide and defect of jurisdiction stand on 
different footing - See the case of “Muhammad Sharif through 
legal heirs and 4 others Vs. Sultan Hamayun and others” (2003 
SCMR 1221). Straitjacket application of doctrine of res-judicata is 
unwarranted in view of the facts involved and mandate of special 
law. There is an exception to the doctrine of res-judicata – 
application thereof can legally be stretched to this case. Finality of 
decision attained cannot be re-opened unless some fraud, mistake 
or lack of jurisdiction is pleaded or established, as observed in the 
case of “Muhammad Raqeeb Vs. Government of Khyber 

Pakhtunkhwa through Chief Secretary, Peshawar and others” 
(2023 SCMR 992). 
15. 
In view of the aforesaid, the Cooperatives Board committed 
no illegality by moving application with the Judicial Officer for 
reconsideration of previous approval and rectification of gross 
illegalities committed qua fraudulent sale of the property. 
Whether Judicial Officer is empowered to cancel 
registered instruments [the sale deeds] or Civil Court(s) 
have the requisite jurisdiction. 
16. 
The objection that Judicial Officer lacked power to cancel 
sale deed(s) is misconceived. Sale deeds were executed in 
consequence of the approval by the Cooperatives Board and 
issuance of NOCs. Once it is found that sale is fraudulent and 
approval extended was without lawful basis, contrary to the settled 
jurisprudence and acknowledged prudence qua public auction(s), 
cancellation of sale deeds is a mere consequence of annulment of a 
fraudulent sale – a specie of consequential relief. Provisions of the 
Act 1993 are clear. The Judicial Officer, upon being called upon, 
had the authority to determine the legality or illegality of the 
approval of disposal of land, and such determination cannot be 
assigned to the Civil Court, in view of the mandate of the Act, 

1993. Incidence of sale deeds, claimed to have had been executed 
in favour of third parties, by or on behalf of undesirable societies is 
different from the nature of the sale deeds, under reference, which 
were the consequence of sale carried out by the then management. 
The case of “Zeenat Bibi and others” (supra) is distinguishable and in 
said case sale deed was not executed in pursuance of any alleged 
sale by the Cooperatives Board, and observations were recorded in 
the context of absolutely different set of facts. Hypothetically 
thinking, sale deed registered pursuant to the issuance of sale 
certificate by the Court(s) executing money-cum-mortgage 
decree(s), would be ineffective and had no legal value once auction 
sale stood annulled. Whether auction purchaser could object to the 
jurisdiction of the executing court on the premise that once sale 
deed was executed only the Civil Court or Registrar of documents 
had the jurisdiction to cancel sale deeds, procured pursuant to 
fraudulent sale(s). Once foundational structure is found and 
declared dilapidate; declaration of instability of the building is a 
logical and obvious outcome – and no such sperate declaration 
needed. In the circumstances, no illegality was committed by the 
Judicial Officer to declare a voidable sale ineffective and of no 
legal effect, including annulment of all subsequent steps / actions.  

What is the effect of order of acquittal of the accused 
persons – beneficiaries of the sale - in case FIR No.15/14. 
17. 
Acquittal of the petitioners in criminal case have had no 
bearing on the reconsideration of the alleged negotiated sale, nor 
could it extend any immunity or protection to the transaction, 
otherwise found fraudulent, deceptive and prejudicial to the 
interests of the claimants. Claim of bona fide purchasers is 
discredited in wake of the facts narrated – sale deeds were executed 
at the instructions of successful bidder, who got executed sale 
deeds in favour of its nominees, and persistently followed the claim 
and remained part and parcel of deceptive / fraudulent sale, and 
actual beneficiary thereof. Requisite ingredients for claiming 
protection under the principle of bona-fide purchaser were 
neither pleaded nor any document provided to show what due 
diligence was carried before purchase.  
Conclusion / Re-iteration of elements establishing fraud: 
18. 
Absence of policy guidelines for carrying-out sales at the 
time of transaction under reference is insignificant. There is no 
plausible answer that policy of public auction, once adopted but 
why then dropped in the case of this particular sale. No force 

majeure situation pleaded. There is no cavil that re-opening of 
transaction of sale requires substantive and convincing information 
qua fraud. To create an exception to the principle of finality, fraud 
must be established. Facts adequately proved fraud, and the 
Judicial Officer rightly exercised the jurisdiction to annul the sale. 
Facts, strikingly, establishing fraud needed to be amplified and 
focused for the purposes of confirming the decision of the Judicial 
Officer, in terms of section 11 of the Act, 1993. Once bid lower 
than the base price was rejected there was no justification to 
accommodate first petitioner, after 10 months, by entertaining 
offered price of Rs.221.000 Million, which was lower than the 
valuation of the property discussed in the meeting of 30.10.2003. 
Absence of time-limit for deposit of 75% of bid price is fatal. 
There was no explanation that why ex-management proceeded to 
extend approval without settling of terms and conditions of sale. 
Change of heart from the decision of selling through public auction 
to alleged sale by way of negotiation / private treaty remained a 
mystery. No explanation provided to justify an exception. One 
cannot sweep these gross illegalities under the carpet. Facts 
narrated unequivocally establish that the then management erred 
while granting approval previously, in wake of blatant illegalities 
and irregularities, crucial being allowing execution of sale deeds 

hastily without adhering to any schedule for payment of 75% of the 
bid price. Hence, grant of previous approval suffers from wrongful 
exercise of authority. Guidance is solicited from decisions in the 
case of “Fazli Hakeem and another Vs. Secretary State and 
Frontier Regions Division Islamabad and others” (2015 SCMR 
795) and “Utility Stores Corporation of Pakistan Limited Vs. 
Punjab Labour Appellate Tribunal and others” (PLD 1987 SC 
447). Ex-management failed to act in accordance with the law and 
where it went against the law, such act is construed as an act 
outside the jurisdiction.  
19. 
In view of the above, it is established that ex-management 
showed willful blindness, selective enforcement, unjustified 
benevolence while extending unwarranted concessions to the 
successful bidder. No rights could be claimed with reference to 
fraudulent sale. Judicial Officer denied retention of ill-gotten gains 
and declared the sale deceptive, fraudulent and contrary to the 
established jurisprudence, deprecating private / negotiated sales in 
substitution to the public auction.  
  
Judgments referred on behalf of the petitioners are 
distinguishable, which are authorities in the context of facts 
involved therein. Reliance to the decision in the case of “Nawab 

Syed Raunaq Ali, etc. Vs. Chief Settlement Commissioner and 
others” (PLD 1973 SC 236) is misconceived and without 
appreciating the distinction drawn in latter decision, reported as 
“The Chief Settlement Commissioner, Lahore Vs. Raja Mohammad 
Fazil Khan and others” (PLD 1975 Supreme Court 331), relevant 
portion of the decision is reproduced, 
It seems to us that while there are cases in which the power of a 
Court, or tribunal of special or limited jurisdiction to suo motu recall 
or review any order obtained from it by fraud has been doubted, yet 
the preponderance of judicial authority is in favour of conceding 
such a power to ever authority, tribunal or Court on the general 
principle that fraud vitiates the most solemn proceedings, and no 
party should be allowed to take advantage of his fraud. There can be 
no rational basis for discriminating between the powers available in 
this behalf to a Court of general jurisdiction and a court or tribunal 
of special or limited jurisdiction, for in either case the effect of fraud 
is the same, and the duty to undo that effect must lie on the authority 
on which fraud is practised. We are, therefore, of the view that even 
a tribunal of limited or special jurisdiction has the power to suo motu 
re-call or review an order obtained from it by fraud. 
However, in the matter of collateral impeachment of such an 
order, the position appears to be different. Whereas, a superior 
Court or a Court of general jurisdiction has the power to disregard, 
as a nullity, an order obtained by fraud or collusion, or on the 
ground of want of jurisdiction in the Court or authority making it, 
such a power is not available to a tribunal which either acts in an 
administrative capacity, or enjoys only a special or limited 
jurisdiction in a defined sphere. As this question has only recently 
been examined by this Court at some length in Raunaq Ali v. Chief 
Settlement Commissioner (P L D 1973 S C 236) it is not necessary to 
go over the same ground again, and it would suffice to state that the 
conclusion reached in that case to the effect that where finality is 
given to the decision of a certain body which has also the jurisdiction 
to decide finally, facts upon which its own jurisdiction is founded, 
that decision cannot be called in question in any other collateral 
proceeding by another tribunal or body of limited jurisdiction. 
  
[Emphasis supplied] 

  
Principle of finality and factum of challenge thrown to an 
order through collateral proceedings was discussed in the case of 
Nawab Syed Raunaq Ali, etc. (supra), which principal otherwise 
was discussed in different context - nature of power exercised by 
certain officers was discussed and observed that the officer was 
merely a reporting agency and was not a court or quasi-judicial 
authority in any sense. Question of challenge through collateral 
proceedings does not arise in this case. 
20. 
In view of the above, I hereby, confirm the order of the 
Judicial Officer of 01.10.2021. Petitions stand dismissed.
