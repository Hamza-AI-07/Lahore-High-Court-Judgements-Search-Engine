General. 
 
 
Admitted facts of the case are that the petitioner was 
initially inducted as a contract employee (Secondary 
School Educator), and his services were subsequently 
terminated. Upon challenge, the competent authority, 
through order dated 09.02.2024, reinstated him as a 
regular employee with effect from 19.10.2009, treating the 
intervening period as extraordinary leave without pay. 
Through 
impugned 
order 
dated 
27.11.2025, 
the 
petitioner’s reinstatement as a regular employee has been 
recalled and regularization has been declared null and 
void. 
2. When confronted that upon reinstatement as a regular 
employee the petitioner had entered the stream of regular 
civil service and hence, the present petition is barred in 
terms of Article 212 of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the Constitution”), learned 
counsel for the petitioner contended that, although the 
reinstatement order did place the petitioner in regular 
service, the department has subsequently treated him as a 
contract employee by recalling the reinstatement order and 
by withholding his salary. It is argued that, in these 
circumstances, 
the 
constitutional 
petition 
remains 

       
 
     W.P. No.8215 of 2025                                                                  2 
 
maintainable. He further submits that the petitioner has 
been vexed twice and that the subsequent inquiry 
culminating in the impugned order violates Article 13 of 
the Constitution. Reliance is placed on Muhammad Ilyas 
v. Government of Balochistan through Chief Secretary 
and 2 others [2025 PLC (C.S.) 523]. 
3. Arguments heard. Record perused. 
4. The fundamental question before this Court is 
whether a contractual employee, once regularized, and, 
brought within the stream of regular civil service, the 
subsequent recall or withdrawal of the reinstatement order 
renders a constitutional petition maintainable, or whether 
the petitioner is required to first avail the departmental 
remedies culminating, if necessary, in an appeal before the 
Punjab Service Tribunal. 
5. It is well-settled that a contract employee, once 
regularized, attains the status of a civil servant under the 
relevant civil service laws. Regularization constitutes a 
fresh appointment, its effect is prospective, and the 
employee thereafter acquires all rights and obligations of a 
civil servant. Cases reported as Deputy Director Food 
Faisalabad 
Division, 
Faisalabad 
and 
others 
v. 
Muhammad Tauqir Shah and others (2021 SCMR 760) 
and Province of Punjab through Secretary Livestock and 
Dairy Development Department, Government of the 
Punjab, Lahore and others v. Dr. Javed Iqbal and others 
(2021 SCMR 767) are referred. The crucial aspect—
overlooked by the petitioner—is that once the competent 
authority reinstated and regularized him, his legal status 
stood transformed into that of a civil servant by operation 
of law. The department’s subsequent disagreement, or 

       
 
     W.P. No.8215 of 2025                                                                  3 
 
withdrawal of reinstatement order does not undo the legal 
effect of the regularization order. The petitioner cannot 
select his remedy based on the department’s present 
stance, nor can departmental reluctance to acknowledge 
his regularization diminish the statutory consequences of 
the regularization. Accordingly, any grievance arising out 
of the impugned withdrawal order, including alleged 
violation of Article 13 of the Constitution forms part of 
the petitioner’s terms and conditions of service, and must 
be agitated within the prescribed departmental hierarchy 
and, if needed, before the Service Tribunal. Constitutional 
jurisdiction cannot be invoked to bypass the statutory 
mechanism merely because the department treats the 
petitioner contrary to law. 
6. In view of the above, this Court is of the considered 
view that the petitioner, having once been regularized, 
squarely falls within the definition of “civil servant,” and 
any challenge to the impugned order of withdrawal of 
reinstatement order of the petitioner cannot be laid under 
Article 199 in view of the express bar contained in Article 
212 of the Constitution. The petition is accordingly 
dismissed in limine, leaving the petitioner at liberty to 
seek redressal of his grievance through the service 
remedies under the law.
