Mr. Tahir Shehzad, Advocate for the petitioner.  
Rana Umair Abrar Khan, A.A.G.  
 
====== 
 
Through this petition under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, petitioner Sarfraz Ali has questioned the 
legality and validity of impugned order dated 
12.05.2023 passed by respondent No.3/Deputy 
Commissioner, Lahore, whereby his son Asad 
Bilal (hereinafter shall be called as detainee) was 
ordered to be arrested and detained for a period of 
thirty days with immediate effect.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends 
that the impugned order for the detention of 
detainee under sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the 
Punjab Maintenance of Public Order (Ordinance), 
1960 is against the law and facts; that no material 
existed with respondent No.3 to justify detention 
of the detainee; that the detainee did not participate 
in any protest and he was apprehended from his 
house just to harass and humiliate him under the 
garb of peaceful protest launched by the public on 
9th May, 2023; that liberty of a citizen is an 
inalienable 
right 
as 
enshrined 
under 
the 
Constitution and the same cannot be curtailed 
merely at the whims of the executive; that the 

W.P. No.32094/2023  
 
 
 
                        2 
 
impugned detention order is nullity in the eye of 
law and is liable to be set-aside.  
3. 
On the other hand, learned Law Officer has 
submitted that under sub-section 3 of Section (6) 
of (Ordinance) ibid the petitioner has alternate 
remedy of filing an appeal before the Home 
Secretary, Government of Punjab, as such this writ 
petition is not maintainable; that there was 
apprehension that the detainee was instigating the 
general public against the law enforcing agencies 
and likely to force them to damage public and 
private properties; that the impugned order was 
passed while taking into consideration the 
recommendations of the CCPO, Lahaore, which 
needs no intervention by this Court in its 
Constitutional jurisdictions.  
4. 
I have heard learned counsel for the 
petitioner as well as learned Law Officer and gone 
through the available record.  
5. 
First of all I would like to dilate upon the 
objection 
of 
learned 
Law 
Officer 
qua 
maintainability of instant writ petition. Freedom 
and liberty of a citizen is a fundamental right 
guaranteed under Article 4 and Article 9 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 
and its infringement tantamount to violation of 
fundamental rights enshrined under Article 2-
A,3,4,9,14 and 18 of the Constitution. When a 
person is detained without any just cause, it 
amounts to violation of his fundamental rights, 
then he may invoke the jurisdiction of this Court 
directly under Article 199 of the Constitution, 
without having course to alternate remedy. 
Reliance is placed on case reported as Abdul Latif 
Shamshad Ahmad .V. District Magistrate, 

W.P. No.32094/2023  
 
 
 
                        3 
 
Kasur (1999 PCr.LJ 20) wherein it has been 
observed as under:- 
“At the very outset I would express that before 
the filing of this writ petition, the making of the 
representation or preference of appeal before 
the Secretary Home Department Government of 
the Punjab is not necessary. It has been held in 
Maulana Shah Ahmad Noorani v. Government 
of the Punjab PLD 1984 Lah.222 and Azad 
Papers (Jasarat) v. Province of Sindh and 
others PLD 1974 Kar. 81 that availability of 
alternate remedy of making representation to 
the 
Provincial 
Government 
against 
the 
impugned order does not oust and eclipse the 
jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court in 
exercise of its writ jurisdiction in a matter of 
instant nature.” 
 Reference may also be made to the cases 
reported as “Mst. Sana Jamil v. Government of 
the Punjab through Secretary and 5 others 
(2016 P Cr LJ 424) and “Syed Mubbashar Raza 
V. Government of Punjab through Secretary 
Home Department and 2 others (PLD 2015 
Lahore 20).  Thus, the objection of learned Law 
Officer qua maintainability of this writ petition is 
repelled.  
6. 
The detainee was detained under sub Section 
(1) of Section 3 of the Ordinance, which reads as 
under:- 
“3. 
Power 
to 
arrest 
and 
detain 
suspected persons.---(1) Government, if satisfied 
that with a view to preventing any person from acting in 
any manner prejudicial to public safety or the 
maintenance of public order, it is necessary so to do, 
may, by an order in writing, direct the arrest and 
detention in such period as may be specified in the order, 
and Government, if satisfied that for the aforesaid 

W.P. No.32094/2023  
 
 
 
                        4 
 
reasons it is necessary so to do, may, subject to the other 
provisions of this section, extend from time to time the 
period of such detention for a period not exceeding six 
months at a time.” 
When the above provision of law read in 
conjunction with Articles 4,9,10 and 15, of the 
Constitution which jealously safeguard liberty of 
every citizen “wherever he may be”, it can safely 
be concluded that the above Article does not give a 
“carte blanche” to the Provincial Government to 
curtail the liberty of ordinary citizens, political 
rivals and ordinary criminals without applying due 
process of law.  In case reported as “Federation of 
Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Interior, 
Islamabad ..Vs.. Mrs. Amatul Jalil Khawaja and 
others” (PLD 2003 SC 442), the Apex Court has 
laid down that every detention order should be in 
conformation with the following criteria:- 
(i) 
The Court must be satisfied that the material before 
the detaining authority was such that a reasonable 
person would be satisfied as to the necessity for 
making the order of preventive detention;  
(ii) 
The satisfaction should be established with regard to 
each of the grounds of detention, and if one of the 
grounds is shown to be bad, non-existent or 
irrelevant, the whole order of detention would be 
rendered invalid;  
(iii) 
The initial burden lies on the detaining authority to 
show the legality of the preventive detention;  
(iv) 
The detaining authority must place the whole 
material, upon which the order of detention is based, 
before the Court notwithstanding its claim of 
privilege with respect to any document, the validity 
of which claim shall be within the competence of the 
Court to decide;  
(v) 
The Court has further to be satisfied, in cases of 
preventive detention, that the order of detention was 
made by the authority prescribed in the law relating 
to preventive detention and that every requirement, of 
the law relating to preventive detention had been 
strictly complied with;  

W.P. No.32094/2023  
 
 
 
                        5 
 
(vi) 
The “ satisfaction” in fact existed with regard to the 
necessity of preventive detention of the detenue;  
(vii) 
The edifice of satisfaction is to be built on the 
foundation 
of 
evidence 
because 
conjectural 
presumption cannot be equated with satisfaction; it is 
subjective assessment and there can be no objective 
satisfaction;   
(viii) 
The grounds of detention should not be vague and 
indefinite and should be comprehensive enough to 
enable the detenue to make representation against his 
detention to the authority, prescribed by law. 
(ix) 
The grounds of detention had been furnished within 
the period prescribed by law, and if no such period is 
prescribed, then “as soon as may be”. 
7. 
It is on the touchstone of above principles, I 
have to examine the grounds on the basis of 
impugned detention order was passed. The same 
are reproduced hereinunder for ready reference:- 
(i) 
“The detainee is an active member of a political 
party and his activities are prejudicial to the public safety and 
maintenance of public order.  
(ii)  
He is inciting the people to stand u[ against the 
government, particularly the youth of his locality to create law 
and order situation, plan unlawful assembly and disturb peace 
in the city.  
(iii). 
There is great apprehension that he and his followers 
can damage private and public property, create difficulties, 
hurdle to public at large by blocking the roads at different 
points of the city. He alongwith his companions can create law 
and order situation and cause harassment amongst the public 
at large.”  
 
8. 
From the gist of impugned order, it is quite 
clear 
that 
it 
based 
on 
assumptions 
and 
presumptions.  All the grounds are vague and 
indefinite. On Court’s query, what was the 
material available with Deputy Commissioner for 
passing impugned detention order, learned Law 
Officer instead of replying this specific query, has 
cited some unfortunate incidents of attacking 
sensitive buildings by the protestors. No doubt 
attacking /ransacking public or private buildings, is 

W.P. No.32094/2023  
 
 
 
                        6 
 
an abhorrent act and cannot be tolerated.  The 
perpetrators of said incidents should be taken to 
task but under the garb of these unfortunate 
incidents, the Executive cannot be given a free 
hand to curtail the liberty of any person at its 
whims. Incidents cited by learned Law Officer 
took place on 09.05.2023, whereas, the impugned 
detention order was issued on 12.05.2023 i.e. after 
three days of the alleged incidents, where no such 
allegation was levelled against the detainees. Even 
otherwise, if there is some proof qua involvement 
of the detainee in said incidents, he may be 
proceeded under the relevant law of the country 
but on that basis provisions of Ordinance ibid 
cannot be invoked. No material whatsoever has 
been placed on record to substantiate the above 
grounds. Article 15 , 16 & 19 of the Constitution 
reads as under:- 
“15. Every citizen shall have the right to remain in, 
and, subject to any reasonable restriction imposed 
by law in the public interest, enter and move freely 
through Pakistan and to reside and settle in any part 
thereof.  
16. Every citizen shall have the right to assemble 
peacefully and without arms, subject to any 
reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the 
interest of public order. 
19. Every citizen shall have the right to freedom of 
speech and expression, and there shall be free of the 
press, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed 
by law in the interest of the glory of Islam or the 
integrity, security or defence of Pakistan or any part 
thereof, friendly relations with foreign States, public 
order, decency or morality, or in relation to 
contempt of court, [commission of] or incitement to 
an offence.” 

W.P. No.32094/2023  
 
 
 
                        7 
 
It is thus quite evident that right of liberty, 
peaceful assembly and freedom of speech and 
expression has been enshrined in the Constitution 
as fundamental rights of every citizen and the same 
cannot be curtailed merely at the whims of the 
executive. The detainee may be a political activist 
but participating in politics or carrying out 
peaceful political activities is neither a crime nor 
give premium to the executive to use Ordinance 
ibid to harass or humiliate a political worker under 
the garb of public safety and maintenance of public 
order. No material prejudicial to the public peace 
and tranquility which is a sina qua non for 
issuance of detention order has been brought on 
record. The Hon’ble apex Court in the case 
reported as Mrs. Arshad Ali Khan ..Vs.. 
Government of Punjab through Secretary 
Home” (1994 SCMR 1532) has observed as 
under:- 
“The word ‘public order’ is accordingly 
referable to public order of local significance 
as distinguished from material up heavals such 
as revolution, civil strife and war. Equally it is 
distinguishable from the popular concept of law 
and order of security of State. Law and order 
represents the largest circle, within which is the 
next circle representing public order and 
smallest circle represents security of the State. 
Hence an activity which affects law and order 
may not necessarily affect public order and an 
activity which may not necessarily affect 
security of the State.  
From the above-stated legal position, it 
is quite clear that  before an act is held to be 
prejudicial to public order, it may be shown 
that the act or activity is likely to affect the 

W.P. No.32094/2023  
 
 
 
                        8 
 
public at large. As a corollary, therefore, it 
follows that an act which concerns only to an 
individual and does not amount to an activity 
prejudicial to the public peace and tranquility 
cannot fall within the ambit of section 3 of the 
Ordinance.” 
9. 
Apparently, respondent No.1 while issuing 
impugned detention order has acted in a 
mechanical manner and blindly relied upon the 
recommendations of the police without applying 
its judicious mind. Impugned order being devoid 
of any material and reasoning cannot be allowed to 
hold the field. Resultantly, instant writ petition is 
allowed as a result whereof impugned order of 
respondent No.3 dated 12.05.2023 is hereby set-
aside. The detainee is directed to be released 
forthwith, if not required in anyother case.
