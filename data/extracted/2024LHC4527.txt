Following question of law is proposed for 
determination, statedly arisen of the order of 
Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, Lahore Bench, 
Lahore, dated 22.03.2022, 
“Whether under the facts and circumstances 
of the case, the Appellate Tribunal Inland 
Revenue was justified to annul orders of 
authorities below and allowing appeal for 
conducting of audit for a period more than 
one year terming it beyond jurisdiction when 
there is no such bar for conducting such 
period?” 
2. 
Question 
rasied 
primarily 
calls 
for 
interpretation of sub-section (2) of section 25 of 
the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (‘Act, 1990’), in 
particular, the condition prescribed for the conduct 
of audit, once in a year. Appellate Tribunal had 
declared that conduct of audit, covering period 
from July 2016 to December 2017 – spreading 
over eighteen months – was beyond the 

STR No.69/2022

jurisdiction of the Officer of Inland Revenue and 
contrary to the mandate of sub-section (2) of 
section 25 of the Act, 1990. 
3. 
Heard.  
4. 
Section 25 of the Act 1990, before being 
amnended through the Finance Act 2024, reads as,  
“25. Access to record, documents, etc.– [(1) A 
person who is required to maintain any record or 
documents under this Act [or any other law] shall, 
as and when required by [Commissioner], produce 
record or documents which are in his possession or 
control or in the possession or control of his agent; 
and where such record or documents have been 
kept on electronic data, he shall allow access to 
[the officer of Inland Revenue authorized by the 
Commissioner] and use of any machine on which 
such data is kept.  
(2) The officer of Inland Revenue authorized by 
the Commissioner, on the basis of the record, 
obtained under sub-section (1), may, once in a 
year, conduct audit” 
5. 
In terms of sub-section (1) of section 25 of 
the Act, 1990, a person, subject to the 
conditionalities prescribed, or its agent may be 
required to produce such record / documents; and 
no limitation / restriction regarding the period of 
time, for which the record / documents could be 
demanded, was provided, but obviously demand 
would be subject to the directions prescribed under 
section 24 of the Act, 1990. In this case, the record 
required to be provided was for the period from 
07/2016 to 12/2017, which demand manifests no 
violation or arbitrariness in terms of sub-section 

STR No.69/2022

(1) of section 25 of the Act, 1990. Evidently, upon 
failure to produce record / documents, the Offier 
proceeded to adopt adjudicatory mechanism 
provided under section 11 of the Act, 1990. In 
terms of sub-section (2) of section 25 of the Act, 
1990, audit may be conducted but once in a year. 
We are unable to identify any explanation in the 
order of the Appellate Tribunal, that how the 
expression ‘year’ was construed or interpreted. 
Whether the expression ‘year’ was construed to 
mean a ‘Calendar year’ or a ‘Financial year’. If it 
was construed as ‘Calendar year’ then period of 
audit from 07/2016 to 12/2016 was within last six 
months of ‘Calendar year, i.e., 2016. And the 
period of audit from 01/2017 to 12/2017 could be 
treated as full one ‘Calendar year’, i.e., 2017. Is 
this position manifests adherence. 
  
And if expression ‘year’ was construed as 
‘Financial year’ then period from 07/2016 to 
06/2017 could be treated as one ‘Financial year’ 
and period of audit from 07/2017 to 12/2017 be 
treatred as first six months of contempreneous  
‘Financial year’. Does this manifest compliance. 
Factual determination, in aforesaid context, was 
missing and with respect to the members of the 
Appellate Tribunal, this conundrum could be 

STR No.69/2022

addressed by ascertaining actual intent of the 
department, inferrable from the record, or upon 
examining past practice, conventionally adopted, 
relevant to the context. Even otherwise, Appellate 
Tribunal patently erred in exercise of jurisdiction 
in rejecting the audit in entirety, instead of 
determining the period of validity, in the context of 
time-limitations prescribed under sub-section (2) 
of section 25 of the Act, 1990.  
  
There is another aspect of the matter. Under 
Sales tax regime tax period means a period of one 
month, or such period as notified accordingly. 
Expression ‘year’ was not defined in the Act, 
1990. Obvivously, the definition or scope of tax 
period under Income Tax Ordinnace, 2001 cannot 
be imported to interpret the expression ‘year’. - 
[Tax year for the purposes of Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 is different]. Ratio settled in the 
case of Faisalabad Electric Supply Company Ltd. 
(FESCO) vs. Federation of Pakistan through 
Secretary, Finance, Islamabad and others (2019 
PTD 1780), is not attracted, which interprets and 
explains the scope of third proviso added to sub-
section (2) of section 25 of the Act, 1990, inserted 
though Finance Act 2018 and omitted through 
Finance Act 2019.

In view of the narrative above, question 
proposed is answered in following terms,  
“An authorized officer may call for the 
documents / record under subsection (1) of 
section 25 for such period as considered 
appropriate, 
within 
the 
time 
period 
prescribed in law for retention of the record, 
but same is required to conduct audit once 
in a year, which expression suggests period 
covering 12 months – either construed as 
Financial year or Calendar year, depending 
upon the intent of the department, evident 
from the record, and / or practice 
conventionally followed by the department”.  
7. 
Evidently, matter requires re-determination 
and it is deemed appropriate to remand matter to 
the Appellate Tribunal, which shall decide the 
appeal of the registered person / respondent afresh, 
in light of answer to the question recorded.  
8. 
Office shall send a copy of this order, under 
seal of the Court, to learned Appellate Tribunal, in 
terms of sub-section (5) of section 47 of Sales Tax 
Act, 1990.
