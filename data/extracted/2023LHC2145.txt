AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J.  Through 
this 
Election 
Appeal under Section 63 of the Election Act, 2017 (Act XXXIII of 2017) 
read with Rule 54 of the Election Rules, 2017 (Amended on 2021) 
appellant has challenged order dated 20.03.2023 passed by respondent 
No.2/Returning Officer Constituency PP-244 Bahawalnagar-VIII 
whereby his nomination papers against the seat of MPA PP-244, were 
rejected on the objection petition filed by respondent No.3.  
2. 
 Facts in brevity are that the Election Commission of Pakistan 
called upon the voters of the Constituency PP-244, Bahawalnagar-VIII, to 
elect a Member from the said Constituency for Punjab Aseembly and the 
schedule of the election was announced. Appellant submitted his 
nomination papers for the seat of Member Provincial Assembly (MPA) 
PP-244 Bahawalnagar-VIII before the Returning Officer. Respondent 

Election Appeal No.6 of 2023/BWP.

No.3 filed an objection petition against the appellant by maintaining that 
latter has not correctly filled the nomination papers and also submitted 
false affidavit. He maintained in his petition that Islamabad High Court 
has disqualified the appellant from the seat of MPA and he has been 
disqualified for life and this verdict was maintained by the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan. Respondent No.2/Returning Officer while 
relying upon case titled “Sami Ullah Baloch V. Abdul Karim Nousherwani 
(PLD 2018 SC 405)” accepted the objection petition and consequently 
rejected 
nomination 
papers 
of 
the 
appellant 
vide 
impugned 
order/notification dated 20.03.2023. Being aggrieved, appellant 
approached this Tribunal through instant appeal.  
3. 
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant inter-alia 
contends that impugned order is against the facts & law, arbitrary, 
fanciful, having no legal effect and result of mis-reading/non-reading of 
available record; that permanent disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 requires 
declaration by any competent Court of law and in the instant case neither 
any declaration has been made by competent Court of law nor appellant 
has been declared that he is not sagacious, righteous, and non-profligate; 
that appellant submitted his nomination papers in accordance with law and 
neither any fact was concealed nor any misrepresentation was made; that 
previous disqualification of the appellant is never hurdle to contest any 
future election; that Returning Officer wrongly accepted the objection 
petition of respondent No.3 which was made after scrutiny process and 
prayed for acceptance of appellant’s appeal, setting aside of impugned 
order and acceptance of nomination papers.

4. 
Contrarily, learned counsel for respondent No.3 assisted by Mr. 
Muhammad Jaffar, Law Officer, Election Commission of Pakistan has 
opposed this appeal by contending that appellant did not meet the 
requirements of law to contest the election; that he submitted wrong 
declaration in his nomination papers and also appended false affidavit; 
that he did not remain Sadiq & Ameen in terms of Article 62(1)(f) of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and his nomination 
papers were rightly rejected; that appellant was de-seated/de-notified by 
Election Commission of Pakistan through notification dated 26.07.2022 
in the light of judgment passed by Hon’ble Islamabad High Court which 
was maintained by august Supreme Court of Pakistan and prayed for 
dismissal of appeal.  
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties as well as learned Law 
Officer for ECP and gone through the record with their able assistance.  
6.  
The question for determination in instant appeal is that whether 
observations made by Hon’ble Islamabad High Court in the previous 
round of litigation that “respondent No.4 (appellant) wrongfully 
mentioned his qualification as BBA and made a false declaration in this 
behalf and he is entitled to be disqualified in terms of Article 62(1)(f) of 
the Constitution” is permanent in nature and as such he is not eligible to 
contest the election in future?  
7. 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, provides that a person shall not be qualified to be elected or chosen 
as a member of Majlis-e-Shoora, unless he is sagacious, righteous and 
non-profligate, honest and ameen, there being no declaration to contrary 

Election Appeal No.6 of 2023/BWP.  
4
by a Court of law. For ease of reference, the language of Article 62(1)(f) 
is reproduced hereunder: 
“(f) he is sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and 
ameen, there being no declaration to the contrary by a court 
of law;” 
 
 
The afore-referred provision of the Constitution, in clean terms, 
describes that only upon a declaration from a competent Court of law, 
someone can be considered as being not sagacious, righteous, non-
profligate, honest and ameen.  
8. 
Although the expression “a Competent Court of Law” has not been 
defined in Article 62 or any other provision of the Constitution but it 
essentially means a Court of plenary jurisdiction having power to record 
evidence and give a declaration on the evidence so recorded. Such a Court 
would include a Court exercising original, appellate or revisional 
jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters. August Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in its judgment titled “Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi V. Mian 
Muhammad Nawaz Sharif (PLD 2017 Supreme Court 265), held as 
under: 
“20. 
The next question emerging for the consideration of this Court 
is what are the fora provided by the Constitution and the law to deal 
with the questions emerging from Articles 62(1)(f) and 63(2) of the 
Constitution. To answer this question we will have to fall back upon 
Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution. A careful reading of the said 
Articles would reveal that the one deals with qualifications of a person 
to be elected or chosen as a member of Parliament while the other 
deals with disqualifications of a person not only from being elected or 
chosen but also from being a member of Parliament. If a candidate is 
not qualified or is disqualified from being elected or chosen as a 
member of Parliament in terms of Articles 62 and 63 of the 
Constitution, his nomination could be rejected by the Returning Officer 
or any other forum functioning in the hierarchy. But where the returned 
candidate was not, on the nomination day, qualified for or disqualified 

Election Appeal No.6 of 2023/BWP.  
5
from being elected or chosen as a member, his election could be 
declared void by the Election Tribunal constituted under Article 225 of 
the Constitution. While election of a member whose disqualification 
was overlooked, illegally condoned or went unquestioned on the 
nomination day before the Returning Officer or before the Election 
Tribunal, could still be challenged under Article 199(1)(b)(ii) or 
Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 as was held in the 
cases of Lt. Col. Farzand Ali and others v. Province of West Pakistan 
through the Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Government of West 
Pakistan, Lahore (PLD 1970 SC 98) and Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi 
v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Law and others (PLD 
2012 SC 1054). However, disqualifications envisaged by Article 
62(1)(f) and Article 63(2) of the Constitution in view of words used 
therein have to be dealt with differently. In the former case the 
Returning Officer or any other fora in the hierarchy would not reject 
the nomination of a person from being elected as a member of 
Parliament unless a court of law has given a declaration that he is not 
sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen. Even the 
Election Tribunal, unless it itself proceeds to give the requisite 
declaration on the basis of the material before it, would not disqualify 
the returned candidate where no declaration, as mentioned above, has 
been given by a court of law. The expression a court of law has not 
been defined in Article 62 or any other provision of the Constitution 
but it essentially means a court of plenary jurisdiction, which has the 
power to record evidence and give a declaration on the basis of the 
evidence so recorded. Such a court would include a court exercising 
original, appellate or revisional jurisdiction in civil and criminal 
cases. But in any case a court or a forum lacking plenary jurisdiction 
cannot decide questions of this nature at least when disputed.” 
 
9. 
The right to contest election is a fundamental right in terms of 
Article 17 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and 
it has to be read into the language of Article 17(2). Declaring someone as 
disqualified for any term to become a member of the parliament is a 
penalty, depriving him of his constitutional rights. In order to deprive a 
citizen of his fundamental right to contest election, the requirement of a 
declaration by a competent Court of law as provided in Article 62(1)(f) of 

Election Appeal No.6 of 2023/BWP.  
6
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 has to be strictly 
construed. Without declaration by a competent Court of law, after 
adopting due process through fair trial, would be against his fundamental 
right guaranteed by the Constitution and he cannot be termed to be no 
longer sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen.  
 
In this regard, august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled 
Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan through President and 
another V. Federation of Pakistan through Ministry of Interior Islamabad 
and others (PLD 2023 Supreme Court 42) held as under: 
“Declaring someone as disqualified for any period to become a member of 
the Parliament is a penalty, depriving him of his constitutional rights. 
Without declaration by a competent Court of law after adopting due process 
through fair trial, determining any right and obligation of a person would 
be against his fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution.” 
 
10. 
Perusal of record reflects that appellant earlier contested General 
Election of Punjab Assembly from the constituency PP-241, 
Bahawalnagar (v), Tehsil Chishtian, District Bahawalnagar and declared 
return candidate by Election Commission of Pakistan vide notification 
dated 28.07.2018. His rival candidate Malik Muhammad Muzaffar Khan 
filed Election Petition before the Election Tribunal of the Lahore High 
Court Bahawalpur Bench, Bahawalpur which was dismissed vide order 
dated 19.11.2018 and his appeal is pending before august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan. In the meanwhile, Mr. Abdul Ghaffar filed a Writ Petition 
(No.4715 of 2018) titled “Abdul Ghaffar V. Election Commission of 
Pakistan etc.” before the Hon’ble Islamabad High Court. It was 
maintained that in the Bye-Election of 2006, appellant mentioned his 

Election Appeal No.6 of 2023/BWP.  
7
qualification as graduate (BBA from Al-Khair University), whereas, in 
the General Election of 2013, he mentioned his qualification as 
intermediate in the nomination papers and in the General Election, 2018, 
he again mentioned his qualification as BBA from Al-Khair Univeristy, 
therefore, as he concealed the material facts, he did not remain honest and 
ameen. Further pointed out that according to the letter dated 14.05.2006 
issued by Registrar, Al-Khair University (AJK) he is not a bona fide 
student of the university and Detailed Marks Certificate issued on 
06.04.2006 is not correct, therefore, affidavit tendered pursuant to the 
order of Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan he made deliberately false 
statement. The Islamabad High Court in the light of submission made 
through writ petition sought report from Al-Khair university and in 
response, the said university through letter dated 25.09.2019 reported that 
appellant has neither been student of Al-Khair University Bhimber (AJK) 
nor graduated in the course of Bachelor of Business Administration. In the 
light of said letter, the Honourable Islamabad High Court obsereved that 
the appellant tendered a false affidavit.  
 
Hon’ble Islamabad High Court while discussing various judgments 
of august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under: 
“In view of the above position of law and facts, respondent No.4 
wrongfully mentioned his qualification as BBA and made a false 
declaration in his behalf he is entitled to be disqualified in terms of 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution.  
For the above reasons, the instant petition is allowed and respondent 
No.4 is declared to be disqualified from holding the position of 
Member Provincial Assembly, Punjab (PP-241, Bahawalnagar-V). 
The Election Commission of Pakistan is directed to de-notify 
respondent No.4 as a successful candidate and do the needful 
forthwith in accordance with law.”  
 

Election Appeal No.6 of 2023/BWP.

Being aggrieved, petitioner filed Civil Appeal No.1271 of 2021 
titled “Muhammad Kashif V. Abdul Ghaffar & others” which was 
dismissed by august Supreme Court of Pakistan vide order dated 
23.11.2021. His review petition also met the same fate and dismissed vide 
order dated 20.10.2022.  
 
Any judicial declaration by a competent Court of law must 
necessarily be based on evidence, oral or documentary. Perusal of 
judgment of Hon’ble Islamabad High Court reveals that neither any 
evidence was recorded nor any positive evidence was on record to 
establish either the qualification mentioned in the declaration was false or 
the appellant referred to the same knowingly and deliberately. In this 
regard august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment titled “Sardar 
Yar Muhammad Rind V. Election Tribunal Balochistan Quetta and othes 
(PLD 2020 Supreme Court 137), held as under: 
“Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution requires that the disqualification 
of an election candidate must be founded on a declaration by a Court 
of law that such person is “not honest”. Any judicial declaration 
must necessarily be based on evidence, oral or documentary. A 
perusal of the judgment of the learned Appellate Tribunal and the 
impugned judgment by the learned Division Bench of the High Court 
do not refer to any positive evidence on the record to establish either 
that the Sanad of Shahad-ul-Aalmia claimed by the petitioner in his 
nomination papers in 2008 is bogus, forged or fake or that the 
petitioner referred to the same knowingly and deliberately as being 
equivalent to a graduate or postgraduate degree.”  
 
 
From the language of the judgment of Hon’ble Islamabad High 
Court, which appears to have persuaded the Returning Officer 
(Respondent No.2), it is clear and obvious that there was no definite 
declaration issued by the said Court of the nature required to attract the 
provisions of Article 62(1)(f) of Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973. The language was in the nature of observation.  

Election Appeal No.6 of 2023/BWP.

11. 
It is settled law that the Returning Officer has no power to issue any 
declaration by itself in a summery jurisdiction. In the present case, the 
only declaration against the appellant under Article 62(1)(f) of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, was given in a 
summery proceeding by the Returning officer on 20.03.2023 without 
recording evidence and giving reasons for invoking disqualification. In 
similar type of situation the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case 
titled  “ROSHAN ALI BURIRO V. SYED MURAD ALI SHAH AND 
OTHERS (2019 SCMR 1939) held as under:  
“Be that as it may, in Sami Ullah Baloch and others v. Abdul Karim 
Nousherwani and others (PLD 2018 SC 405) we have held that the 
disqualification of an election candidate or a holder of elected office 
under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution comes into existence when 
he is declared by a Court of law to lack any of the qualities 
mentioned in clause (f) of Article 62(1) of the Constitution. In the 
present case, the only declaration against the respondent under 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution was given in summary 
proceeding's by the Returning Officer on 06.04.2013. As already 
noted above, no evidence was recorded by the Returning Officer to 
sustain his finding nor he recorded reasons for invoking 
disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution. He is not 
a Court of law but a statutory forum of limited jurisdiction. 
Therefore, the condition that only a Court of law can issue a 
declaration of disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of the 
Constitution is not met in the present case. Moreover, the learned 
Election Tribunal has not declared the respondent, directly or 
indirectly, to lack any of the qualities mentioned in Article 62(1)(f) 
of the Constitution. Although the judgment of this Court dated 
02.5.2013 resurrected the order by the Returning Officer, we do not 
consider that the said order passes the test of effectiveness laid down 
in Sami Ullah Baloch's case (ibid) for declaring a disqualification 
under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution. This Court has held there 
that: 
 
"32. Secondly, on the other hand, a candidate for election 
who has committed misconduct falling within the terms of 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, in particular, 
misrepresentation, dishonesty, breach of trust, fraud, 
cheating, lack of fiduciary duty, conflict of interest, 
deception, dishonest misappropriation, etc, as declared by 
a Court of civil jurisdiction has on the Islamic and also 
universal criteria of honesty, integrity and probity, 
rendered himself unfit to hold public office. ... It is in such 
circumstances that a person declared to be dishonest or in 
breach of his trust or fiduciary duty or being non-righteous 
or profligate must suffer the burden of that finding of 
incapacity or as long as the Court decree remains in force. 
..." 
10. 
No finding in terms of the wrongs identified above in the 
quoted text is recorded in the order dated 06.04.2013 by the 

Election Appeal No.6 of 2023/BWP.  
10 
Returning Officer. As such, the said order is ineffective to impose a 
disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, 
Accordingly, the respondent does not suffer from a lifetime bar under 
Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution as contended by the learned 
counsel for the petitioner. Therefore, the respondent was eligible to 
contest the General Election of 2018.” 
 
12. 
A Division Bench of this Court observed that the question whether 
the declaration/statements of the nomination papers were false or incorrect 
cannot be ascertained without carrying out factual probe and could not be 
done by the Returning Officer in summery jurisdiction and in the caes 
titled “Syed Fida Hussain Shah V. Election Tribunal and other (PLD 2018 
Lahore 788), held as under: 
“In the case of Rai Hassan Nawaz supra, this Court has observed 
that the question whether the declaration/statements of the candidate 
in the nomination papers were false or incorrect in any material 
particular, cannot be ascertained without carrying out a factual 
probe. This exercise cannot be undertaken in constitutional 
jurisdiction and could not have been gone into by the Returning 
Officer or learned Appellate Tribunal in summary jurisdiction.”  
13. 
In view of above discussion, there is no declaration issued by a 
competent Court of law in terms of Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution of 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, therefore, the impugned 
order/notification dated 20.03.2023 is not sustainable in the eyes of law.   
14. 
For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is allowed and impugned 
order/notification dated 20.03.2023 passed by respondent No.2/Returning 
Officer is set-aside. Consequently, Returning Officer, Constituency PP-
244, Bahawalnagar-VIII is directed to accept the appellant's nomination 
papers. Notwithstanding anything stated above, it is clarified that the 
findings recorded and observations made herein are based only on a 
tentative assessment of the material before the Tribunal, in the facts and 
circumstances brought to the notice of the Tribunal, for the limited 
purpose of deciding this appeal. The Election Commission of Pakistan and 

Election Appeal No.6 of 2023/BWP.

other competent Authorities/Courts/Functionaries shall, however, be at 
liberty to independently exercise their power, if any material is placed 
before them, initiate proper proceedings and pass orders under the 
provisions of Election Act, 2017 and other relevant laws without being 
influenced by observations made and findings recorded in this judgment.
