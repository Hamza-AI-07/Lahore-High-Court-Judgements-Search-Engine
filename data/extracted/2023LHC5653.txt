Prosecutor with Muhammad Ali, ASI. 
Mr. Muhammad Ahmad Bhatti, Advocate for the 
complainant.  
 
Through this petition under Section 497 Cr.P.C., petitioner has 
sought post arrest bail in case FIR No.441 dated 21.08.2023 registered 
under Section 462-C PPC at Police Station Pacca Laran, Tehsil Liaqat 
purr, District Rahim Yar Khan.  
2. 
Heard. Record perused.   
3. 
Petitioner was under the allegation of committing theft of gas 
by tampering into auxiliary or distribution pipeline of SNGPL (Sui 
Northern Gas Pipelines Limited) which is an offence under section 
462C PPC entailing punishment up to 10 years’ imprisonment. 
Offences carrying punishment up to 10 years or more are usually 
regarded as serious offences, therefore, prosecution by all times is at 
call of duty to collect concrete evidence so as to ensure that broad 
extent of the criminality has been determined and that they are able to 
make a fully informed assessment.  Before dilating upon the matter 
for bail in the context of further inquiry and availability of sufficient 
material against the accused/petitioner, it was expedient to collect 
information about layout plan of gas pipelines by SNGPL for supply 
of gas to end users; therefore, on direction, learned Prosecutor after 
collecting information from office of concerned Company submitted 
as under;  
 

Crl. Misc. No. 3535-B of 2023 
 
 
 
 
              2 
 
There are three lines of Sui gas; (i) Transmission Lines (ii) 
Distribution Supply Lines (iii) Distribution Feeder Lines. 
Transmission lines usually having diameter of 16 to 42 inch or 
more start from the gas well and ends at city gates for supply 
of gas to various cities/industries through Sales Meter Station 
(SMS). These lines generally contain pressure of gas 500 psi 
(pound per square inch) or above. Where the transmission line 
ends, distribution lines start which generally contain high 
pressure of 50 to 100 psi or above; these lines have generally 
diameter of 6 to 12 inches or above. However, it is pertinent to 
mention that Sales Meter Station (SMS) may provide gas to 
industries only through dedicated SMS wherein said lines have 
no city/town load. These lines are mostly located at main 
passages/road or location from where gas is distributed to 
towns and localities through Town Border Station (TBS). 
Distribution Feeder Lines start from TBS and gas is provided 
to consumer i.e., domestic or commercial at low pressure 
generally from 5 to 15 psi. The diameter of said lines is usually 
1 to 4 inches. Before installation of said lines, a map is prepared 
by drawing section of Sui Gas at regional level. The existence 
of said lines may be verified through map/DLM (Drawing 
Location Map).   
 
4.     Duty of prosecution to collect concrete evidence is mentioned in 
para 4.12 of the Code of Conduct for Prosecutors (COCP) issued by 
the Prosecutor General under section 17 (1) of the Punjab Criminal 
Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions and Powers) Act, 2006 
hereinafter be called as CPS Act, which is reproduced as under; 
 
“4.12: Prosecutors may only take a decision when they are 
satisfied that the broad extent of the criminality has been 
determined and that they are able to make a fully informed 
assessment. If prosecutors do not have sufficient information 
to take such a decision, the investigation should proceed and a 
decision taken later in accordance with the Full Code Test. 
 
 
Therefore, when prosecutors do not have sufficient information to 
take such a decision, the investigation should proceed. However, 
pursuant to para-6 of COCP, they while applying threshold test on 
interim report u/s 173 Cr.P.C. can request the Court for postponement 
of trial as mandated under sub-section (6) of section 9 of CPS Act; 
which is reproduced; 
 (6)  On receipt of an interim police report under section 173 of 
the Code, the Prosecutor shall– 
 
(a) examine the reasons assigned for the delay in the 
completion of investigation and if he considers the 

Crl. Misc. No. 3535-B of 2023 
 
 
 
 
              3 
 
reasons compelling, request the Court for the 
postponement of trial and in case investigation is not 
completed within reasonable time, request the Court 
for commencement of trial; and 
 
            (b)  in cases where reasons assigned for delay in the 
completion of investigation are not compelling, 
request the Court for commencement of trial on the 
basis of the evidence available on record. 
 
The role of prosecutors to guide the police for collection of evidence 
is regulated through the same COCP in following manners; 
 
2.1 
Prosecutors must cooperate and coordinate with the 
police to ensure fair and just prosecutions.  
 
2.2 
    Coordination and cooperation mean and 
entails advice and guidance to the police regarding 
possible lines of enquiry, evidential requirements and pre-
charge procedures. It is meant to assist the police and 
other investigators to complete the investigation within a 
reasonable period of time and to build the most effective 
prosecution case. However, prosecutors cannot direct the 
police or other investigators except in accordance with 
paragraph 4.                                            (emphasis supplied) 
 
According to above command prosecutors should look into the 
evidential requirements and take care of all pre-charge procedures 
while suggesting possible lines of inquiry so as to build a good 
prosecution case for its submission before the Court.  
 
5.    It is misconception that evidential requirement for proving an 
offence depends upon the principle of evidence but as a matter-of-fact 
it is embedded in the substantive law through respective penal 
provision, and how to transform such requirement into admissible 
format through different kinds of evidence is the subject of law of 
evidence. Case analysis is the first step to understand the evidential 
requirement which is triggered on the receipt of FIR by the 
prosecutors pursuant to section 12 of the CPS Act. Therefore, from 
the very early-stage prosecutors are required to associate into the 
process, and in this respect Prosecutor General can issue general 
guidelines to prosecutors and the investigating officers as per section 
10 (1) of the CPS Act which is as under; 

Crl. Misc. No. 3535-B of 2023 
 
 
 
 
              4 
 
 
10.   Powers of Prosecutor: – (1) The Prosecutor General may 
issue general guidelines to the Prosecutors or officers responsible 
for investigation for effective and efficient prosecution. 
 
 
6.       In order to prove an offence, the literal and constructive 
understanding of relevant penal provision is the essence of case 
analysis which gives way to understand the mode and manner of 
proving such offence. What could be the possible evidential 
requirement for proof of an offence under section 462C PPC, it is 
essential that such section be read in its entirety along with chapter 
XVII-A of PPC wherein it falls. Here is the section; 
 
 462C: Tampering with auxiliary or distribution pipelines of 
petroleum: (1) Any person who willfully does tampering or 
attempts to do tampering or abets in tampering with any auxiliary or 
distribution pipeline of petroleum not being a main transmission and 
transportation pipeline but includes a distribution system, 
distribution pipeline or any other related system and equipment, as 
the case may be, of petroleum is said to commit tampering with 
auxiliary or distribution pipelines of petroleum. 
 
(2) 
Any person who commits or abets in tampering with 
auxiliary of distribution pipeline of petroleum for the purpose of: - 
 
(a) 
Theft of petroleum; or 
(b) 
Disrupting supply of petroleum, 
 
                      shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment which 
may extend to ten years but shall not be less than five years and 
with fine which may extend to three million rupees. 
 
Let’s bifurcate the section to understand the evidential requirement; 
at first it is essential to see the definition of ‘petroleum’ as given in 
section 462A PPC as under; 
 
(h) “Petroleum” means oil, crude oil, refined oil products, natural 
gas, LPG, Air Mix LPG, LNG and CNG;  
 
Not only different types of natural gas, it also encompasses oil etc. As 
per section 462C PPC cited above, the first element is to prove the 
situation of “willfully tampering”; therefore, what connotes the word 
“willfully” and what is the tampering, it is to be responded. Definition 
of tampering is given in section 462A PPC as under; 
 

Crl. Misc. No. 3535-B of 2023 
 
 
 
 
              5 
 
(j) “Tampering" includes interfering or creating hindrance in 
flow or metering of petroleum by unauthorized entry into 
metering system or transmission and distribution lines either by 
breaking the seals or damaging or destructing the same or in any 
manner interfering with the meter or interfering with its original 
condition. 
  
Keeping in view the above definition, if the section is read in parts, 
the following is evidential requirement to prove the tampering; 
1. Evidence of interference or hindrance like using any connecting 
device, clumps, pipe, hose, material or anything for the purpose 
of getting petroleum or creating hindrance in flow or metering of 
petroleum. 
 
2. Such interference must be unauthorized and that too in metering 
system, or transmission and distribution lines. 
 
3. It must be done either by breaking the seal or damaging or 
destructing such system or lines or in any other manner 
interfering with original condition of meter or lines.  
 
Whereas word ‘Willfully’ could be defined like referred in case 
reported as “ROHAN AHMAD and others versus The STATE and 
another” (2022 P Cr. LJ 259) which is as under;  
According to Halsbury's Laws of England, Fourth Edition, 
Vol.11, para. 1252 `willfully' means deliberately and intentional, 
not accidentally or inadvertently. Frank R. Prassel in his 
Criminal law, Justice and Society 1979 Edition, page 150 says 
that "Intent is probably the most common, at least for the major 
traditional offences, but some codes call the proof of `willful' 
`voluntary', `malicious', `corrupt', or `purposeful' product 
instead. These terms are generally accorded similar legal 
meanings, subject to limited variation from one jurisdiction to 
another.  
 
According to Black's Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition, "an act is 
done willfully and knowingly when the actor intends to do it and 
knows nature of the act. Further that an act or omission is 
`willfully' done, if done voluntarily and intentionally and with 
the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the 
specific intent to fall to do something the law requires to be done; 
that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard 
the law. It goes on to say that when used in criminal context it 
generally means an act done with a bad purpose, without 
justifiable excuse; stubbornly, obstinately, perversely. The word 
is also employed to characterize a thing done without ground for 
believing it is lawful or conduct marked by a careless disregard 
whether or not one has the right so to act."  
 
Stroud's Judicial Dictionary Vol. 4, third Edition, says "that the 
legal meaning of willful is purposely without regard to bona 
fides or collusion and deliberately and intentionally but does not 
involve obstinacy of an obstructive kind and it means an 

Crl. Misc. No. 3535-B of 2023 
 
 
 
 
              6 
 
intentional disobedience. In the Law Terms and Phrases 
Judicially Interpreted, by Sardar Muhammad Iqbal Khan Mokal, 
the term “willfully” amounts to nothing more than this that the 
person whose action is in question, mows that he is doing and 
intends to do what he is doing and is free agent. He further says 
that willful means wantonly, intentional, deliberately and 
consciously and not accidentally or by inadvertence. Reference 
is made there to Madras State Waqf Board v. Tajammal Hussain 
(AIR 1968 Mad. 332) and Kedar Nath v. The State (AIR 1965 
All. 233)." 
 
Willfully as mens rea thus means voluntarily, maliciously, and 
purposefully doing an act which is forbidden by law.   
 
7.     Tampering would be proved by ocular account in respect of point 
of interference in distribution line etc. size of hole or point from where 
gas was being stolen, recovery of pipe, hose etc. showing 
corresponding size of such articles. Snaps/videos of an exercise of 
digging out the earth for search of such material. Likewise, evidence 
of safe custody and dispatch of articles to concerned Lab for testing 
in order to obtain evidence of residues of petroleum in recovered pipe 
etc., so that it could be proved as being used for flow of petroleum, 
and of course the Lab report in this respect.  
 
Once the tampering is proved, next step in section 462C PPC is 
to prove that such pilferage of petroleum was for the purpose of theft 
or disruption of supply.  If it was for theft, then prosecution must take 
lead to show the place where actually the petroleum is being used for 
any purpose. If it was being used in residential house for kitchen 
purposes, then the appliance connected therewith must be taken into 
possession, and to prove for its use in commercial or industrial 
activities, proof in any form like sealing of property and securing of 
evidence by video graphing the action or its snapping as the case may 
be.  
 
However, if tampering was intended for ‘disrupting supply of 
petroleum’, it connotes of causing any mischief, terrorist or sabotage 
activity; therefore, evidence of broader purpose of accused and his 
link with any group or organization interested in such subversive 
activities, is essential. The broader motives of the accused could be to 

Crl. Misc. No. 3535-B of 2023 
 
 
 
 
              7 
 
satisfy their personal grudge against the company, like passing of 
supply pipeline nearby their lands creating devaluation or danger to 
their life and property.  
 
Likewise, documentary evidence for dropping of gas pressure 
at particular area, as tracked/reported in the main monitoring system 
of the company due to theft or disrupting supply of petroleum, is 
necessary, because as per section 462A (k) PPC, a standard pressure 
in the pipelines is always measured as not less than three hundred psig 
(per square inch gauge) and regulation of such pressure may be 
prescribed from time to time.  
 
In both situations, either to prove theft or disrupting the supply 
of petroleum, a drawing location map (DLM) prepared by SNGPL is 
necessary to be obtained for tendering into evidence in order to show 
the existence of such auxiliary or distribution pipeline near or around 
the place of occurrence.  
 
8.      Tampering is not an easy job, it cannot be done by a layman, 
rather it is expected that some expert might have put his efforts 
through technical skills to materialize it. Thus, the prosecution is 
obliged to get that very expert tracked and consequent recovery of 
tools or implements used for such activity, but if the accused had 
himself indulged or did it by his own, the recovery of such tools from 
him is also essential.  It must be remembered that it is very important 
piece of evidence, otherwise mere using of petroleum unauthorizedly 
would not be an offence under section 462C PPC because in that case 
it is expected that somebody else had committed the tampering for the 
purpose of supply of petroleum to simpletons for unlawful gains.  
 
The above cited can be the least evidence, collection whereof 
is essential to prove the offence under section 462C PPC or like 
offences under Chapter XVII-A of PPC, therefore, prosecution is 
reminded of its duty to collect such type of evidence before sending 
the case to the Court.

9.     I have observed that in this case, no evidence is available on the 
record and thus sufficient material is lacking to connect the petitioner 
with the commission of offence. The Supreme Court of Pakistan in a 
case reported as “MUHAMMAD NAWAZ alias KARO Versus The 
STATE” (2023 SCMR 734), with reference to Section 497 Cr.P.C., 
has held as under:- 
“This court has time and again held that liberty of a person 
is a precious right, which cannot be taken away unless there 
are exceptional grounds to do so. Merely on the basis of bald 
allegations, the liberty of a person cannot be curtailed.” 
 
 
Petitioner is behind the bars since 23.08.2023 and no more required 
for further investigation; keeping him behind the bars for indefinite 
period would not serve any useful purpose to the prosecution.  All 
these facts, prima-facie, call the case of present petitioner for further 
inquiry falling under the ambit of sub-section (2) of Section 497 
Cr.P.C. as enunciated in cases reported as “JAHANZEB AND 
OTHERS versus STATE through A.G. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
Peshawar and another” (2021 SCMR 63), “MUHAMMAD 
SHAFIQUE and another versus The STATE and others” (2017 
SCMR 79), “SALMAN ZAHID Versus The STATE through P.G. 
Sindh” (2023 SCMR 1140), “GUL MUHAMMAD Versus The 
STATE” (2023 SCMR 857), “MUHAMMAD AMIN versus The 
STATE” (2017  YLR 609) and “MUHAMMAD ARSLAN AHMED 
versus The STATE” {2017 P Cr. L J 434 (Sindh)}. 
 
10. 
 In view of what has been discussed above, the petition in hand 
is allowed and the petitioner is admitted to bail subject to his 
furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/- with one surety in 
the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court.
