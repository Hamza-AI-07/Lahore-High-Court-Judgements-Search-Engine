Arguments heard. Record perused.

As the partition of agricultural land is in 
question and Chapter-II of the Punjab Land Revenue 

Writ Petition No.59198 of 2024 
3 
 
 
Act, 1967 deals with partition matters of agricultural 
land. Under Section 135 of the Act ibid any joint 
owner of agricultural land may apply to a revenue 
officer for partition of the joint land and separation of 
his share. In 2013, through an enactment the Punjab 
Land Revenue (Amendment) Act, 2012, Section    
135-A was added whereby a modus oprandi is 
provided 
for 
partition 
that 
immediately 
after 
sanctioning of the inheritance mutation the revenue 
officer without awaiting any application from any co-
owner shall serve notice on all joint owners of the land 
to submit an agreed scheme of private partition of the 
joint land and on receipt of such scheme under 
subsection (1), the revenue officer shall affirm the 
scheme according to the provisions of Section 147 of 
the Act ibid otherwise he shall proceed ahead the case 
as per law. For ready reference, Section 135A of the 
Act ibid is reproduced as under:- 
“135-A. Partition in case of inheritance.—(1) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in section 135, 
immediately after the inheritance mutation has been 
sanctioned and without any application, the 
Revenue Officer shall serve notice on all joint land-
owners of the holding to submit, within thirty days, 
a scheme of private partition agreed to by all the 
joint land-owners. 
(2) If the scheme of private partition under 
subsection (1) is submitted, the Revenue Officer 
shall affirm the scheme in accordance with the 
provisions of section 147. 
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, 
a scheme for private partition between all the joint 
land-owners may include site of a town or village. 

Writ Petition No.59198 of 2024 
4 
 
 
(4) If the scheme under subsection (1) is not filed 
within the stipulated time, the Revenue Officer shall 
immediately 
commence 
proceedings 
for 
the 
partition of the joint holding.” 
The Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1967 is a special law 
which deals with the matters pertaining to the rights in 
the agricultural land and the aforesaid provision [i.e. 
Section 135-A] clearly directs the Revenue Officer to 
immediately start the partition proceedings even if any 
application is submitted by the co-owners or not and 
also to decide the said matter expeditiously.   
 
Further, under Section 141 of the Act ibid, the 
Revenue Officer is also competent to decide the 
question of the title of such land. For ready reference, 
Section 141 of the Act ibid is reproduced as under:- 
“141. Question of title of holding — (1) If a question 
of title in the holding is raised in the partition 
proceedings, the Revenue Officer shall inquire into the 
substance of such question. 
(2) If as a result of the inquiry, the Revenue Officer is of 
the opinion that the question of title raised in a partition 
proceedings: 
(a) is well founded, he may, for reasons to be 
recorded, require a party specified by him to file 
a suit in the competent court, within such period 
not exceeding thirty days from the date of his 
order, for obtaining a decision regarding the 
question; or 
(b) is not well founded, he shall proceed with the 
partition of the holding. 
(3) In case the suit is filed under subsection (2), the 
Revenue Officer shall suspend further action on the 
partition proceedings till the decision of the suit and 
submission before him the other or decree of the Court. 
(4) In case the suit is not filed within the specified 
period, the Revenue Officer shall proceed to decide the 

Writ Petition No.59198 of 2024 
5 
 
 
question of title and on that basis, the partition of the 
holding.” 
Section 141 of the Act ibid was substituted through the 
Punjab Land Revenue (Amendment) Act, 2015 with 
the following provision:- 
“3. Amendment in Section 141 of Act XVII of 1967.—
In the said Act, for Section 141, the following shall be 
substituted. 
“141. Question of title of holding — If a question of 
title in the holding is raised in the partition proceedings, 
the Revenue Officer shall inquire into the substance of 
such question and decide the matter after hearing the 
parties.” 
Now after the aforesaid amendment in respect of the 
partition between the parties at the time of 
incorporation of inheritance mutation, if the parties/co-
sharers are agreed for the scheme of private partition 
then the Revenue Officer shall affirm the scheme 
otherwise he shall immediately commence the 
proceedings of partition of the joint holding and 
complete the same within thirty days. If any question 
of title in the holding arises during the partition 
proceedings, the Revenue Officer under Section 141 of 
the Act ibid is fully competent to decide this issue after 
hearing the parties and the decision of Civil Court is 
not required in this regard.  
5. 
As far as this plea of the petitioners that civil 
suit is pending and during the pendency of the suit 
before the Civil Court, the revenue hierarchy has no 

Writ Petition No.59198 of 2024 
6 
 
 
jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter, suffice it to say 
that as per Section 141 of the Land Revenue Act, 1967 
if a question of title in the holding is raised in the 
partition proceedings, the Revenue Officer shall 
inquire into the substance of such question and decide 
the matter after hearing the parties. In this case, the 
title of the suit land is not disputed between the parties 
rather petitioners claimed that private settlement had 
already been arrived at between the parties as per 
Section   135-A of the Act ibid, thus the revenue 
officer has jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter 
regarding some private settlement in respect of the 
joint 
property. 
In 
this 
case, 
respondent 
No.5/Muhammad Imtiaz filed an application for 
review of order dated 15.02.2020 whereby the Naib 
Tehsildar adjourned the applications for partition sine 
die on the ground of pendency of civil suit. The Addl. 
Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Kasur accepted the 
applications of Muhammad Imtiaz/respondent No.5, 
the brother of the present petitioners and directed the 
Naib Tehsildar to decide the review applications 
within one month. The said order was upheld by the 
Addl. Commissioner as well as Member (Judicial-II), 
Board of Revenue vide orders dated 17.10.2022 & 
30.11.2023 respectively. As apparent from the 
available record, it appears that the petitioners are 

Writ Petition No.59198 of 2024 
7 
 
 
trying to linger on the matter on frivolous and 
unwarranted grounds. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in a recent judgment titled as Syed Ghazanfar 
Ali Shah Vs. Hassan Bokhari and others (2024 SCMR 
154) has seriously discarded such practice of delaying 
the partition matter without any valid reason.   
6. 
Even otherwise, in ROR No.2980/2022 order 
was passed on 30.11.2023 and the said order was not 
assailed by the petitioners within reasonable time 
rather they filed Review Petition No.401/2023 under 
Section 8 of the Board of Revenue, (Punjab) Act, 1957 
which was dismissed by the Member (Judicial-II), 
Board of Revenue, Punjab vide order dated 23.07.2024 
on the ground of limited scope of the remedy of review 
as well as non-existence of any sufficient ground for 
review of his earlier order.  
7. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners has not 
pointed out any illegality or material irregularity in the 
impugned order passed by the Member, Board of 
Revenue and has also not identified any jurisdictional 
defect.  
8. 
In nutshell, this writ petition is dismissed in 
limine being devoid of any merit. However, the 
Revenue Officer concerned is directed to decide the 

Writ Petition No.59198 of 2024 
8 
 
 
matter strictly on merits and in accordance with law 
expeditiously.
