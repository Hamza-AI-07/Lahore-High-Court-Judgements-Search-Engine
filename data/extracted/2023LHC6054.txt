Petitioner by: 
M/s Ch. Ishtiaq Ahmed Khan, Zarish Fatima 
and Mian Ehtisham Ahmad, Advocates

ALI ZIA BAJWA, J.:- Through the instant 
Criminal Revision petition filed under Sections 435 and 439 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter ‘Cr.P.C.’) read with Section 
561-A Cr.P.C. vires of the order dated 06.10.2023, passed by learned 
Administrative Judge, Anti-Terrorism Courts, Lahore (hereinafter ‘the 
Administrative Judge’) were called into question through which the 
custody of the petitioner was handed over to the Investigating Officer of 
case FIR No.2597/2023, dated 14.09.2023, offences under Sections 440, 
395, 386, 148 & 149 PPC read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 
1997 (hereinafter ‘ATA’), Police Station Township, Lahore, on physical 
remand. During the pendency of this petition, the impugned order 
elapsed but through Crl. Misc. No.3/2023, order dated 20.10.2023 has 
been placed on the record through which a further seven days physical 
remand of the petitioner was allowed by the Administrative Judge.  
2. 
 
Under Section 439 Cr.P.C. the High Court is empowered, 
while exercising its revisional jurisdiction, to examine the vires of any 
proceedings the record of which has been called for by itself or which 

Crl. Revision No.67181/2023 
 
(2) 
otherwise comes to its knowledge. The revisional jurisdiction is very 
wide and is not a power, but rather a duty, which must be exercised 
whenever facts calling for its exercise are brought to the notice of the 
Court. Guidance is sought from the decision of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in Mushtaq Ahmad Case1 and the relevant extract available on 
page 128 is reproduced infra:-- 
 “ ....Under section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code the 
High Court has a power to interfere upon information in 
whatever way received, as the section clearly says that it 
may do so in any case in which it has itself called for the 
record or which has been reported for orders or 'which 
otherwise comes to its knowledge'. These are words of wide 
import. In the present case the record of the case was placed 
before the learned Judge in the course of his inspection and 
the facts of the case thus came to his knowledge. Under this 
section the High Court has also the right to exercise its 
power on its own initiative and there can be no warrant for 
the proposition that the High Court is debarred from 
examining the record suo moto.” 
Further reliance can be placed on Dr. Waqar Hussain vs. The State – 
2000 SCMR 735 and Syed Manzoor Hussain Shah vs. Syed Agha 
Hussain Naqvi and another - 1983 SCMR 775. 
3. 
 
Arguments heard and the record perused. 
4. 
 
Perusal of the record available on the file reflects that being 
a nominated accused of the aforementioned case, the petitioner was 
arrested by the investigating officer on 26.09.2023, who was produced 
before the Administrative Judge on 27.09.2023 with the prayer for grant 
of physical remand, which was allowed with the direction that the 
petitioner shall be produced before the said court on 11.10.2023. The 
remand granting order dated 27.09.2023 was challenged through Crl. 
Revision No.64428/2023 before this Court, which was allowed, the 
remand granting order was set aside being a non-speaking one and the 
matter was remanded to the Administrative Judge to adjudicate upon the

request of the investigating agency for grant of physical remand afresh 
after hearing all the concerned and furnishing cogent reasons. 
Accordingly, the Administrative Judge, vide order dated 06.10.2023, 
granted fourteen days physical remand of the petitioner to the 
Investigating Officer. On the expiry of said physical remand, on 
20.10.2023 another request was made by the Investigating Officer for 
the grant of further physical remand, which was allowed, and custody of 
the petitioner was handed over to the Investigating Officer for an 
additional period of seven days. Through Crl. Misc. No.3/2023, 
subsequent physical remand granting order dated 20.10.2023 has also 
been brought to the notice of this Court.  
5.  
 
It will be beneficial to explore the term ‘remand’ before 
further dilating upon the legal proposition involved in this case.  
According to the Black’s Law Dictionary by Bryan A. Garner, Eighth 
Edition, printed by Thomson West, on page 1319 term ‘remand’ has been 
defined as infra: -  
“To recommit (an accused person) to custody after a 
preliminary examination…” 
In P Ramanatha Aiyar’s ADVANCED LAW LEXICON, 4th Edition, 
Volume-4, published by LexisNexis Butterworths Wadhwa at page 4155 
‘remand’ has been well-defined as under:- 
 “An order by a criminal court remanding the accused to further 
detention till the investigation of the offence is complete or the trial 
can commence.” 
6. 
 
It shall not be out of place to discuss what orders can be 
passed by a Magistrate when an accused is produced before him during 
the course of an investigation. A person concerned in any cognizable 
offence or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or 
credible information has been received or a reasonable suspicion exists 
of his having been so concerned can be arrested by a police officer 

Crl. Revision No.67181/2023 
 
(4) 
without a warrant or order of Magistrate.2 Article 10 (2) of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter ‘the 
Constitution’) read with Section 61 of the Code stipulates that a police 
officer cannot detain an arrestee in custody for more than 24 hours in the 
absence of a specific order of Magistrate passed under Section 167 of the 
Code. The Legislature has expressly separated the period for which a 
person can be detained in custody prior to the commencement of an 
inquiry or trial into two stages. The first phase is the period of 24 hours 
as envisaged under Article 10 (2) of the Constitution and Section 61 of 
the Code. In this period the investigating agency has the power to detain 
a person, subject to the conditions contained in Section 54 of the Code, 
for the purpose of investigation. If the investigation cannot be completed 
within 24 hours, the police must forward the accused to the nearest 
Magistrate as mandated by Section 167(1) of the Code.  
7. 
 
When an accused is remanded back to the Investigating 
Officer by the Magistrate, it means that his custody is handed over to the 
investigating agency for the purpose of further investigation through a 
well-reasoned order that ‘Custodial Interrogation’ is indispensable to 
unearth the truth and collect the further evidence which is not possible in 
the absence of the accused. The prospect of the collection of further 
evidence/incriminating material is a substantial premise for remanding 
the accused to police custody. The Magistrate must undoubtedly be 
convinced of the need for remand of the accused to such custody while 
considering the material already available on the record and  
he must record his reasons in that respect. On the other hand,  
when the Magistrate arrives at the decision that there is no need or 
justification for further physical remand, he sends the accused  
to 
prison 
for 
further 
detention 
and 
it 
is 
called 
judicial  
remand because the accused is considered in custody of the 
Magistrate/court.

8. 
 
The difference between ‘physical remand’ and the ‘judicial 
remand’ is characterized by the degree of access the Investigating 
Officer has to the accused for the purpose of interrogation. In police 
custody, an accused is in the exclusive custody of the investigating 
officer, and the primary aim is to allow the police to conduct “custodial 
interrogation” to unearth the truth in any given case.  On the other hand, 
judicial custody refers to the custody of an accused in jail. When a 
person is in jail custody, he is indirectly deemed to be in the custody of 
the court. The police officers or investigating agencies do not have the 
same level of access to an accused as they do in police custody. In fact, 
police officers and investigating agencies usually cannot question the 
accused in judicial custody without seeking permission from the court 
and following such conditions as prescribed by the court. 
9. 
 
The Magistrate under Sections 167 and 63 of the Code read 
with Rule 6 of Volume-III, Chapter 11, Part B of the Rules and Orders of 
the Lahore High Court, Lahore can also discharge an accused, in the 
custody of an investigating agency, against whom no sufficient cause or 
material is available on the record to connect him with the commission 
of a cognizable offence. Discharge of an accused person does not 
amount to smothering of the investigation, cancellation of the case, 
termination of prosecution or acquittal. An investigation, if in progress, 
can continue unaffected by such an order of discharge. Discharge of an 
accused by the Magistrate, be it of any kind, cannot be equated with 
acquittal of the accused person so discharged as there is a world of 
difference between a discharge and an acquittal and there is no question 
of mixing one with the other under any circumstances.3 
10. 
 
To strike a balance, between the needs of a thorough 
investigation on the one hand, and the protection of the citizens from the 
oppressive attitude of the Investigating Agency, on the other hand, is the

crucial duty of a Magistrate dealing with the question of grant of 
physical remand. The Magistrate must examine whether there is a case 
made out by the Investigating Agency to hand over the accused on 
remand or on the pretext of remand, the liberty of a citizen is likely to be 
curtailed. Therefore, granting remand is an exception and not the rule for 
which cogent and plausible reasons must be rendered by the Magistrate 
dealing with the matter. One of the salutary requirements of natural 
justice is to spell out the reasons, meaning thereby, a speaking order is 
required to be passed. It is obligatory for the Investigating Officer to 
transmit the record of the police diaries along with the forwarding of the 
accused before the Magistrate. It is the duty of courts to be watchful for 
the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy 
encroachments thereon.4  The passing of the mechanical orders granting 
physical remand by the Magistrate has been deprecated by the Superior 
Courts of this Country. In Abdul Majid and another vs. Qazi Abbas 
Hussain Shah – 1995 SCMR 429, while dealing with the matter of grant 
of physical remand, it was ruled by the Supreme Court of Pakistan as 
infra: -  
“This Court expects the presiding officers to perform their duties 
with their eyes and ears open as required under the law and pass 
orders after judicial application of mind and not in perfunctory and 
slipshod manner allowing room for mistakes because these mistakes 
whether they are inadvertent or not reflect upon the conduct of the 
Judge and can be considered as a minus point. We disapprove and 
deprecate such conduct of the presiding officers and it should be 
discouraged in true sense as far as possible.” 
This view was further affirmed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case titled “The State vs. Nasir Javed Rana, Civil Judge 1st 
Class/Magistrate Section 30, Rawalpindi – PLD 2005 SC 86.” Justice 
Fazal Karim wrote in his book5 that interrogation of the person in 
custody is a low-visibility area and most of the sins against constitutional 
and legal rights are committed during that period.

Article 9 of the Constitution guarantees that no person 
would be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law, while 
Articles 10, 13 and 14 of the Constitution provide safeguards against the 
unlawful arrest, self-incrimination, and torture for the purpose of 
extracting evidence. Article 10-A of the Constitution, which ensures the 
right to a fair trial, is also available during the pre-trial proceedings 
including investigation. It was observed in Rehan vs. The State – 2009 
SCMR 181 that a Magistrate, while granting remand, should be mindful 
of the Constitutional guarantees provided under the afore-referred 
Articles of the Constitution.  
12. 
 
During the course of arguments learned Deputy Prosecutor 
General, time and again, by referring to Sub-section (2) of Section 21-E, 
ATA contended that it empowers the Administrative Judge that in case 
further evidence may be available while no bodily harm has been or will 
be caused to the accused, further physical remand can be granted. For 
ready reference Sub-section (2) of Section 21-E, ATA has been 
reproduced as under:-  
 “(2) No extension of the time of the remand of the accused in 
police custody 1[or custody of any other investigating agency 
joined in the investigation] shall be allowed unless it can be 
shown by the investigating officer to the satisfaction of the 
Court that further evidence may be available and the Court is 
satisfied that no bodily harm has been or will be caused to the 
accused: Provided that the total period of such remand shall 
not exceed ninety days.”  
It is true that Section 21-E, ATA empowers the special court to grant 
physical remand, but the words ‘satisfaction of the Court’ used in the 
above-referred provision of law are of utmost importance. Satisfaction of 
the court connotes subjective satisfaction based on the cogent material 
available on the record to satisfy itself regarding the progress in the 
investigation made in the previous period of remand and further 
expectation of availability of evidence.  

Crl. Revision No.67181/2023 
 
(8) 
13. 
 
 Although, Section 21-E, ATA authorizes/empowers the 
Administrative Judge to allow the detention of the accused either in 
police custody or in judicial custody, however, as the remand order 
deprives the personal liberty guaranteed under Articles 9 and 10 (2) of 
the Constitution, therefore, such order should not be passed in a 
mechanical manner, rather such powers should be exercised with great 
caution. Learned DPG has further contended that providing reasons 
while granting physical remand is a requirement of Section 167(3) of the 
Code whereas physical remand in cases of terrorism is dealt with under 
Section 21-E, ATA which does not require that Administrative Judge 
should provide any such reasoning while handing over the custody of 
accused to the police. This contention of learned DPG is highly 
misconceived firstly for the reason that under Section 24-A of the 
General Clauses Act, 1897, it was the mandatory duty of the 
Administrative Judge to pass an order, which is judicial in nature, under 
Section 21-E, ATA after due application of judicious mind to the record 
available before him while furnishing cogent and satisfactory reasons. 
Furthermore, Section 21-E, ATA does not bar the application of general 
principles to be followed by a Magistrate while dealing with the matter 
of remand under Section 167 of the Code. In this regard, Section 32, 
ATA is relevant which provides an overriding effect of said Act. It has 
been specifically provided in that Section that the provisions of Code 
shall, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this 
Act, apply to the proceedings before Anti-Terrorism Court. Section 
32(1) of the ATA has been reproduced below as a ready reference: 
“32. Overriding effect of Act.--1. The provisions of this Act shall 
have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or any 
other law but, save as expressly provided in this Act, the provisions 
of the Code shall, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the 
provisions of this Act apply to the proceedings before [an Anti-
Terrorism Court] and for the purpose of the said provisions of the 
Code [an Anti-Terrorism Court] shall be deemed to be a Court of 
Sessions.” 
Underlined for emphasis 

Crl. Revision No.67181/2023 
 
(9) 
As per Section 32(1), ATA, provisions of the Code are fully applicable 
to the Anti-Terrorism Court, if they are not inconsistent with any 
provision of ATA. Section 167(3) of the Code requires that while 
authorizing the detention of an accused in the custody of the police, the 
Magistrate shall record his reasons for so doing. Moreover, sub-section 
(3) of Section 21-E, ATA provides that while dealing with the question 
of remand, the Administrative Judge of the Anti-Terrorism Court shall 
be deemed to be a Magistrate. This provision makes it abundantly clear 
that while dealing with the request of remand, the Administrative Judge 
shall act as a Magistrate. In the light of above discussion, the 
Administrative Judge is required to provide cogent reasons while 
allowing detention of an accused in police custody. Reference is made to 
the decision of this Court in Raja Waheed Mehfooz case6, wherein it was 
categorically ruled as under:- 
“7. 
…The learned Judge, ATC-II, Rawalpindi, is badly mistaken 
in understanding that, while exercising his powers under section 21-
E of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, he is not required to give reasons for 
the order granting physical remand of the accused persons and his 
such interpretation is completely in violation of the provisions of 
subsection (3) of section 21-E of the Act, which provides that, the 
Special Court under Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, shall be deemed to be 
a Magistrate for purposes of subsection (3) of section 21-E of the 
Act. As such, the learned Special Court under Anti-Terrorism Act, 
while dealing with the matters of remand of the accused persons, is 
equally responsible to observe the provisions of section 167(3), 
Cr.P.C., and the remand order, if passed without assigning any 
reasons, would be a nullity in the eye of law, and would be termed 
nothing, but as an invalid remand order.” 
Thus, there should not be any confusion that general principles of 
granting physical remand provided under the Code are fully applicable 
while dealing with the remand proceedings under Section 21-E, ATA 
and we are persuaded to hold that proceedings of remand in the cases 
triable by Anti-Terrorism Court, shall be dealt with under Section 21-E, 
ATA read with Section 167(3) of the Code.

14. 
 
The Superior Courts of the Country have time and again 
ruled that remand is not to be granted in a mechanical manner each and 
every time the Investigating Agency makes such a request. Hence, 
whenever a request for physical remand of an accused is made in a 
criminal case, the Magistrate must apply his independent judicious mind 
to the facts and circumstances of that case especially while considering 
the accusations leveled against him, so that it would be investigated in a 
thorough and proper manner. Where the custody of the accused is 
essential for moving forward for the purposes of the investigation, he 
may be remanded to police custody for the minimum possible time 
keeping in view the request made by the police and the material 
available on the record as well as the investigation conducted so far by 
the investigating agency.7 Rule 7, Chapter-11, Part-B, Volume-3 of the 
Rules and Orders of the Lahore High Court, Lahore, also provides that 
the remand can be granted in cases of real necessity only and the 
Magistrate should satisfy himself that the accusation is well founded and 
that there are good and sufficient reasons for remanding the accused to 
Police custody instead of detaining him in the Magisterial custody. It is 
further provided that in order to form an opinion as to the necessity or 
otherwise of the remand applied for by the Police, the Magistrate should 
examine the copies of the diaries, prepared under Section 172 of the 
Code and submitted to the Magistrate under Section 167 of the Code to 
ascertain what previous orders (if any) have been made in the case, and 
the longer the accused person has been in custody the stronger should be 
the grounds required for further remand to police custody. 
15. 
 
Perusal of the police file reflects that the petitioner was 
arrested in this case on 26.09.2023 and he was produced before the 
Administrative Judge on 27.09.2023. The Investigating Officer moved 
an application for the grant of physical remand of the petitioner for the 
recovery of Kalashnikov allegedly used during the occurrence, currency

amount of Rs.10,00,000/-, prize bonds, different registered deeds, ID 
Card, and cheque book. Although that order was set aside being a non-
speaking order and case was remanded back to the Administrative Judge 
to decide the application of the Investigating Officer requesting remand 
through a speaking order. The petitioner was handed over to the 
investigating agency for fourteen days till 20.10.2023. A bare glance at 
the police file reflects that no proceedings were carried out till 
30.09.2023 i.e., four days after arrest of the petitioner, when he remained 
on physical remand with the investigating agency as no police diaries for 
those four days are available on the police file. Rule 25.53 of the Punjab 
Police Rules, 1934 casts a duty on the Investigating Officer that in 
consonance with the provisions of Section 172(1) of the Code a case 
diary shall be maintained and submitted daily during an investigation. 
The same has been reproduced hereinafter for ready reference: - 
“25.53. Case diaries. - (1) Section 172(i), Code of Criminal 
Procedure requires that a case diary shall be maintained and 
submitted daily during an investigation by the investigating 
officer. In such diary shall be recorded, concisely and clearly, 
the steps taken by the police, the circumstances ascertained 
through the investigation and the other information required 
by Section 172(i), Code of Criminal Procedure.” 
In the instant case, there is absolutely nothing available on the record as 
to why the investigation remained without any progress from 26.09.2023 
to 30.09.2023 while petitioner was in custody. Even on 01.10.2023 and 
02.10.2023, no case diary qua the investigation proceedings is available 
on the police file. Similar was the position on 08.10.2023 and 
15.10.2023. It is also noteworthy that Investigating Officer did not 
incorporate the fact of not carrying out investigation during these days in 
the next case diary when he conducted further investigation. Rule 25.57 
of the Punjab Police Rules, 1934 requires that if on any day or days, an 
Investigating Officer of a case makes no investigation, he shall enter a 
statement to this effect in the case diary of the day on which he next does 
something towards the completion of the case. The record reflects that 

Crl. Revision No.67181/2023 
 
(12) 
for most of the days, the investigation remained at a halt without any 
justification. The petitioner remained on physical remand for twenty-
four days but there is no material progress in the investigation. The 
Investigating Officer could not make any significant progress in the 
investigation of this case. Recovery of two lac rupees was affected from 
the house of the petitioner, which was already in the knowledge of police 
on two different occasions, to show off the so-called progress in the 
investigation. Police diaries also reflect that no serious efforts were made 
by the investigating officer to conclude the investigation swiftly. An 
accused cannot be handed over to the Investigating Officer on his whims 
and wishes. The petitioner has been languishing in police custody for the 
last twenty-four days without any material progress in the investigation. 
16. 
 
In the instant case, keeping in view the poor progress shown 
by the Investigating Officer during the physical remand, spreading over 
24 days, we are constrained to observe that the provisions of Sub-section 
(2) of Section 21-E, ATA read with Section 167 of the Code and 
principles enunciated by the Superior Courts of this Country on the 
subject were squarely overlooked by the Administrative Judge, which 
straightway require that further remand of the accused in police custody 
cannot be justified. In Ghulam Sarwar and another case8, this Court 
authoritatively observed that the Magistrate shall examine the police file 
before deciding the question of remand and if no investigation was 
conducted after having obtained physical remand, the Magistrate shall 
refuse to grant further physical remand.  
17. 
 
It seems that the remand of the petitioner was extended in a 
slipshod and whimsical manner without inspection of case diaries, which 
was a mandatory duty of the Administrative Judge granting remand. As 
discussed above, the Magistrate granting remand should be cautious and 
watchful, especially for extending the period of remand to police custody

(13) 
as the same requires very strong and compelling grounds which are 
conspicuously missing in the impugned order dated 20.10.2023. The 
impugned order, on the face of it, is violative of the statutory provisions 
governing the question of grant of physical remand and guidelines 
rendered by the Superior Courts on the subject. 
18. 
 
Before parting with the judgment, it shall be beneficial to 
formulate guidelines, for the Magistrate/Administrative Judge to be 
followed in the future, as infra: -  
I. 
The question of remand in cases exclusively triable by the 
Anti-Terrorism Court is governed by Section 21-E of the 
ATA but Section 167 of the Code and the relevant 
considerations shall also be applicable as much as those are 
not inconsistent with the provisions of ATA.  
II. 
The remand of an accused can only be granted when he is 
produced before the Magistrate. No remand order should be 
passed by the Magistrate in the absence of an accused.  
III. 
It is the bounden duty of the Magistrate to apply her/his 
independent judicious mind to the facts and circumstances 
of the case to arrive at the decision, whether the physical 
remand should be granted or refused. Application of an 
independent judicious mind being sine qua non must be 
reflected in the order passed by the Magistrate and for that 
purpose, the case diaries and other documents available on 
the record must be examined to arrive at a just decision.  
IV. 
The Magistrate must pass a speaking order while dealing 
with the question of grant or refusal of physical remand, 
furnishing cogent and convincing reasoning as the grant of 
remand to police custody is not a rule, but an exception, 
therefore, the accused can only be handed over to 

Crl. Revision No.67181/2023 
 
(14) 
investigating agency in cases of real necessity and that too 
for the shortest possible time required for investigation.  
V. 
Before granting remand, the Magistrate should ensure that 
prima facie evidence is available on the record to connect 
the accused with the commission of the offence in question 
and the physical custody of the accused is necessary for the 
collection of further evidence.  
VI. 
In case the Investigating Officer seeks an extension in 
physical remand, the Magistrate should examine the 
progress since the previous order(s), as the longer the 
accused person has been in custody the stronger should be 
the grounds required for further remanding him to the 
police custody. If no investigation was conducted after 
having obtained the physical remand, further remand should 
be refused.   
VII. 
The accused must be given a fair opportunity to oppose the 
request of the Investigating Officer regarding the grant of 
remand himself or through his counsel. His objections 
should be brought on the record and the Magistrate should 
ensure that no physical harm is caused to him during police 
custody.  
VIII. 
To strike a balance, between the needs of a thorough 
investigation on the one hand and the protection of the 
citizens from the oppressive attitude of the Investigating 
Agency, on the other hand, is the foremost duty of a 
Magistrate dealing with the question of grant or refusal of 
physical remand. 
19. 
 
In the sequel to what has been discussed above, the instant 
revision petition is accepted and the impugned order dated 20.10.2023 
passed by the Administrative Judge qua further granting physical remand 
of the petitioner is set-aside. The Investigating Officer present in Court 

Crl. Revision No.67181/2023 
 
(15) 
is directed to produce the petitioner before the Administrative Judge 
today for lodging him into judicial lockup.  
20. 
 
These are the detailed reasons for our following short order 
of even date allowing the instant revision petition: - 
“For the reasons to be recorded later, the instant revision petition is 
accepted, the remand order dated 20.10.2023 passed by learned 
Administrative Judge, Anti-Terrorism Courts, Lahore, is set-aside. The 
Investigating Officer is directed to produce the petitioner before the trial 
court today for lodging him into judicial lockup.”
