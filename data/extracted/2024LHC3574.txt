ALI ZIA BAJWA, J.:- Through this petition filed 
under Section 497 Cr.P.C. (hereinafter „the Code‟) the petitioners seek their 
release on post-arrest bail in case FIR No.370/2022, dated 10.06.2022, 
offences under Sections 324, 353, 186, 337-H(2), 148 & 149 PPC read with 
Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, registered with Police Station City 
Taunsa Sharif, District Dera Ghazi Khan. 
2.       During the course of proceedings on 25.04.2024, it was observed that, 
although the aforementioned criminal case had been registered as far back as 
10.06.2022, the police report as envisaged under Section 173 of the Code 

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(2) 
(hereinafter „the investigation report‟) was yet to be submitted. 
Consequently, the District Police Officer of Dera Ghazi Khan, along with the 
Incharge of Investigations for the said District, was directed to appear in 
person. Additionally, the reports were requisitioned from the Anti-Terrorism 
Court, Dera Ghazi Khan, and the Special Public Prosecutor to explain the 
reasons for extending judicial remand without requiring the investigation 
agency to submit its investigation report. 
3. 
On 02.05.2024, the reports requisitioned from the District Police 
Officer and the Special Prosecutor of the Anti-Terrorism Court were duly 
filed. The report submitted by the District Police Officer revealed that an 
inquiry conducted by the Superintendent of Police (Investigation) concluded 
with the initiation of departmental action against the delinquent police 
officials responsible for the delayed submission of the investigation report. 
However, the report remained conspicuously silent on the reasons for the 
inaction on the part of the supervisory officer. The report submitted by the 
Special Public Prosecutor disclosed that the main reason for the non-
submission of the investigation report was the nonavailability of the final 
opinion from the Medical Officer, as well as the reports from the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency. The report filed by the Anti-Terrorism Court, Dera 
Ghazi Khan, indicated that, despite a direction being issued on one occasion 
to submit the investigation report, the needful was not done. The Prosecutor 
General of Punjab was issued a notice regarding the situation and directed to 
appear before the Court. Additionally, the Additional Inspector General of 
Police (Investigation), Punjab, was summoned. A report was also 
requisitioned from the Forensic Science Agency to address the delayed 
preparation of the requisite reports. 
4. 
Arguments heard, and the requisite filed reports were perused. 
5. 
The persistent issue of delayed submission of investigation reports 
continues to plague our criminal justice system. This enduring issue hampers 
not only the efficiency of judicial proceedings but also impacts the overall 
integrity and reliability of criminal trials. Delays in the investigation process 

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(3) 
strike at the very heart of truth, undermining the fairness and sanctity of the 
investigation itself. In the shadows of these delays, the insidious menace of 
tampering arises, weaving falsehoods and padding evidence. False 
implications take root, distorting the truth. Witnesses find their recollections 
fading, their vivid testimonies growing dim and unreliable. As time goes by, 
the detailed facts that support a criminal case fade away, leaving a shaky 
foundation where the truth once stood strong. Moreover, such lags often 
translate into prolonged detentions for suspects awaiting trial and an 
agonizing wait for victims seeking closure. The notion of swift justice is 
consistently compromised by procedural delays in the submission of 
investigation reports, highlighting systemic inefficiencies that urgently 
require thorough scrutiny and reform. These persistent issues not only 
obstruct the administration of justice but also weaken public trust in the legal 
process, necessitating a critical reassessment of mechanism of submission of 
investigation reports. The late submission of investigation reports epitomizes 
the adage ‘justice delayed is justice denied.’ Despite numerous instances1 
where Constitutional Courts took cognizance of this issue and issued explicit 
directions, the designated functionaries have consistently failed to fulfill their 
duties. 
6. 
The late submission of an investigation report also violates several 
Constitutional provisions in Pakistan, specifically Articles 4, 9, 10, and 10-A 
of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter „the 
Constitution‟). Article 4 ensures that individuals are dealt with according to 
the law, and delays violate the due process of law. Article 9 protects personal 
security and liberty, which are compromised by extended incarceration and 
prolonged uncertainty. Article 10 provides safeguards for arrest and 
detention, and delays hinder the right to a timely trial resulting in prolonged

detention. Finally, Article 10-A guarantees a fair trial, and justice delayed is 
inherently unjust. The delayed submission of investigation reports flagrantly 
breaches Article 10-A, undermining the right to a fair trial. Such delays 
compromise due process, leave both the accused and the victim in a state of 
uncertainty, and undermine public trust in the judicial system. 
7. 
The procedure and timeframe for submitting an investigation report are 
delineated under Section 173 of the Code. Initially, the statute did not specify 
a concrete timeframe. It merely stipulated that the investigation should be 
concluded without unnecessary delay. This provision was designed to ensure 
a swift transition from investigation to prosecution, albeit without setting a 
strict deadline. Although, the Code does not fix a timeline for the completion 
of a criminal investigation, however, it mandates its completion without 
unnecessary delay. The term „unnecessary delay‟ is inherently flexible, as its 
interpretation varies with the nature and complexity of each case. In simpler 
cases, a delay might be deemed unnecessary if basic investigative steps are 
not promptly taken and the available evidence is not collected. Conversely, in 
more intricate cases involving extensive evidence and multiple witnesses, 
what constitutes unnecessary delay is more lenient, allowing for thorough 
and meticulous investigation. This approach ensures that the criminal justice 
system remains both efficient and fair, adapting to the unique demands of 
each case. 
8. 
Due to persistent and extraordinary delays in the submission of 
investigation reports, the Government was compelled to introduce an 
amendment in 1992.2 This amendment involved the insertion of a proviso 
clause following subsection (1)(b) of Section 173 of the Code. This 
legislative change aimed to address the inefficiencies and expedite the 
process, ensuring a timelier progression from investigation to judicial 
proceedings. The inserted proviso clause has been reproduced below for 
better understanding: - 
                                       
2 Amendment through the Act No. XXV of 1992 

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(5) 
[provided that, where investigation is not completed within a period of fourteen 
days from the date of recording of the first information report under Section 
154, the officer incharge of the police station shall, within three days of the 
expiration of such period, forward to the Magistrate through the Public 
Prosecutor, an interim report in the form prescribed by the Provincial 
Government stating therein the result of the investigation made until then and 
the Court shall commence the trial on the basis of such interim report, unless, 
for reasons to be recorded, the Court decides that the trial should not so 
commence], 
The proviso clause added to Section 173(1) of the Code mandates that if an 
investigation is not completed within fourteen days from the date the crime 
report is recorded under Section 154 of the Code, the officer in charge of the 
police station must submit an interim report to the Magistrate through the 
public prosecutor within three days after this period expires. This interim 
report should detail the results of the investigation conducted up to that point. 
Based on this interim report, the court is expected to commence the trial 
unless it records specific reasons for deciding not to proceed. The legislation 
provided no discretionary power to the public prosecutor to withhold the 
report and return it to the investigating officer for any reason. This mandate 
ensures a streamlined process, whereby once a report is received, the public 
prosecutor is compelled to proceed with it according to the legal mandate 
without the option to delay or divert it for additional investigation or 
corrections.  
9.   The concept of an interim investigation report was introduced to serve a 
multitude of purposes. It establishes judicial oversight to ensure prompt 
submission of investigation reports, enabling the court to evaluate whether 
the evidence suffices for trial and facilitating the swift conclusion of criminal 
cases. It provides the court with crucial insights into the progress of the 
investigation, thereby upholding transparency and fostering a more dynamic 
criminal justice system. Moreover, it empowers the court to expedite the 
investigation by issuing necessary directions when an investigation is 
incomplete thus preventing undue delays. The submission of an interim 
report also serves as a safeguard against the fabrication and dishonest 
conduct by the investigating officer during subsequent stages of an 
investigation. Given the constraints of Section 172 of the Code, which 

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(6) 
classifies the case diaries as a privileged document, the interim report stands 
as the sole document capable of reflecting the status of an investigation. It 
ensures transparency, preventing the crafting and padding of evidence or the 
false implication of an innocent person at a later stage. 
10.     The 1992 Amendment also introduced a pivotal change in the 
procedure for submitting investigation reports, mandating that such reports 
must be filed through the Public Prosecutor. The rationale behind routing the 
investigation report through a prosecutor is to engage the prosecutor at a very 
early stage, allowing him to assess the investigation report and render his 
expert opinion. This early involvement is crucial for a successful 
prosecutorial system, as it ensures that the case is meticulously evaluated 
from the outset. By scrutinizing the report, the prosecutor can identify any 
flaws or deficiencies, provide necessary corrections, and ensure that the 
evidence is robust and legally cogent. It is pertinent to observe here that when 
the law mandates an investigation report to be forwarded by a specific 
authority, it must be done with the reasoning of that authority and due 
diligence. This process should not reduce the authority to a mere post office 
but should involve a thoughtful application of mind to ensure the purpose of 
forwarding is fulfilled meaningfully. In forwarding even an interim 
investigation report, the prosecutor should render his opinion and highlight 
any shortcomings on the part of the investigating agency. This process 
ensures that the report not only communicates findings but also undergoes 
preliminary scrutiny to uphold the quality and integrity of the investigation. 
11.    The next relevant provision of law is Section 9 of the Punjab Criminal 
Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions, and Powers) Act, 2006 
(hereinafter ‘The Prosecution Act’). For the matter at hand, Subsections 4 and 
5 of Section 9 are particularly relevant, which have been reproduced 
hereinafter: -  
 9.  Conduct of prosecution: - 
       ............................. 

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(7) 
(4)  A police report under section 173 of the Code including a report 
of cancellation of the first information report or a request for 
discharge of a suspect or an accused shall be submitted to a Court 
through the Prosecutor appointed under this Act. 
(5)  The Prosecutor shall scrutinize the report or the request and 
may– 
(a)  return the same within three days to the officer incharge of 
police station or investigation officer, as the case may be, if he finds 
the same to be defective, for removal of such defects as may be 
identified by him; or 
 
(b)  if it is fit for submission, file it before the Court of competent 
jurisdiction. 
Section 9 (4) & (5) of The Prosecution Act aligns with Section 173 of the 
Code. These provisions of law ensure a cohesive legal framework by 
stipulating that investigation reports, including those related to the 
cancellation of a First Information Report or requests for discharging a 
suspect or accused, are routed through a designated prosecutor. Under clause 
(a) of subsection (5), Prosecutors are empowered to return any report they 
find defective to the investigating officer for correction. The cumulative 
effect of the afore-referred provisions of law is to establish a mechanism for 
the timely submission of comprehensive investigation reports. It is Section 
9(5) (a) of The Prosecution Act, which created potential complications by 
granting the prosecutor the authority to point out the defects in an 
investigation report and return the same within three days for removal of such 
defects. Although designed to create a successful prosecutorial model, the 
above provisions have been misused by investigating agencies and 
prosecutors. Returning defective investigation reports has led to years-long 
delays in criminal cases. The misuse of Section 9 (5) (a) of The Prosecution 
Act has rendered the proviso to Section 173(1) of the Code redundant, as 
even interim reports are now withheld from the courts under the guise of 
defective reports. The law, originally enacted to facilitate the successful 
prosecution of criminal cases, has unfortunately led to miscarriages of justice 
in countless cases. 

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(8) 
12. 
The ambit of Section 9(5)(a) of The Prosecution Act is strictly 
confined to the act of returning a defective investigation report for the 
rectification of its deficiencies. It does not extend to directing the 
investigating officer to reinvestigate or craft the evidence against the accused. 
In our considered opinion, a „defective investigation report‟ is intrinsically 
distinct from a „defective investigation‟ itself. Allowing the prosecution to 
review and direct the rectification of investigative flaws would unleash a 
torrent of reinvestigations, creating ample opportunities for tampering with 
evidence in an overzealous pursuit of convictions in every criminal case. We 
are cognizant of the fact that, following the promulgation of The Prosecution 
Act, the prosecution and investigating agency collaborate closely from the 
very inception of a criminal case. However, at the conclusion of the 
investigation, when the investigation report reaches the prosecutor, he cannot 
be permitted to return it to the investigating agency simply because it lacks 
plausible and cogent evidence sufficient for conviction. Instead, the report 
should be forwarded to the court, accompanied by his assessment as required 
under Section 9(7) of The Prosecution Act. This ensures that the prosecution 
does not overstep its bounds, but rather lets the chips fall where they may 
within the judicial process. Returning the investigation report to the 
investigating agency after the completion of the investigation to rectify 
defects in the investigation process would constitute an overreach, going 
beyond the purview of the provisions of The Prosecution Act. This would be 
akin to overstepping one’s bounds, disrupting the intended separation of 
responsibilities within the criminal justice system.  
13. 
To discern what constitutes a defective investigation report, one must 
turn to Section 173(1)(a) & (b) of the Code, which delineates the requisite 
elements of such a report. The investigation report, in a form prescribed by 
the Provincial Government, must include the names of the parties involved, 
the nature of the information received, and the identities of individuals 
familiar with the circumstances of the case. Additionally, it must state 
whether the accused, if apprehended, has been remanded into custody or 

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(9) 
released on bond, specifying whether the release with or without sureties. 
Furthermore, the investigation report must be communicated to complainant, 
as prescribed by the Provincial Government, regarding the actions taken by 
the investigating officer. Should any of these essential elements be missing 
from the investigation report, it may rightfully be deemed defective. It does 
not mean that defective investigations shall be swept under the rug. Section 
13(9)(d) of The Prosecution Act explicitly mandates that a prosecutor shall 
report to the District Public Prosecutor any details of investigations 
conducted in violation of the law or the instructions issued by the Prosecutor 
General. The District Public Prosecutor, in turn, may inform the head of 
Investigation of the District and the Prosecutor General to take appropriate 
action against the delinquent investigating officer. However, under the 
pretext of a defective investigation, an investigation report cannot be 
withheld from reaching the court. Such conduct on the part of the prosecutors 
is a flagrant violation of the mandate of the law. 
14. 
The above-referred provisions of the law clearly establish a mechanism 
where a report regarding an incomplete investigation cannot be returned to 
the investigating agency but must be forwarded to the court. However, in the 
case of a defective investigation report, the same may be returned to the 
investigating agency to rectify those defects. Section 12(2) of The 
Prosecution Act further mandates that when a prosecutor returns a defective 
report for correction, he must also set a deadline for the removal of those 
defects. The prosecutor must ensure that the investigating officer is not left in 
the lurch, providing clear instructions and a reasonable timeframe, thus 
ensuring that the investigation proceeds without a hitch and no stone is left 
unturned. 
15. 
Although in the domain of the criminal justice system, the timely 
submission of an investigation report is primarily governed by Section 173 of 
the Code read with Section 9 of The Prosecution Act, involving the 
investigating agency and prosecution, each bearing distinct responsibilities, 
but it would be unjust to lay the blame solely upon these two agencies for  

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(10) 
 
the tardy submission of investigation reports. Within the legal framework, 
along with the investigating agency and prosecution, various other 
stakeholders have the responsibility to curb the issue of delayed investigation 
reports with due diligence. Area Magistrates, Trial Courts, Criminal Justice 
Coordination Committees, and Superintendents of Prisons also stand as 
pivotal actors in our criminal justice system to ensure the timely submission 
of investigation reports. They shoulder a statutory burden to ensure the swift 
submission of investigation reports, as mandated by Section 173 of the Code. 
We would like to elaborate the legal framework and the measures prescribed 
therein to secure the timely submission of investigation reports, as envisioned 
under Section 173 of the Code.  
Investigating Agency and Prosecution Department   
16. 
The investigating agency and the prosecution department stand as the 
linchpins of the criminal justice system, entrusted with formidable statutory 
duties under the provisions of both the Code and The Prosecution Act 
regarding the timely submission of investigation reports as has been 
discussed above in detail. The primary duty lies with the investigating 
officer, who must diligently gather evidence and compile the investigation 
report without unnecessary delay. His role is crucial, as delays often originate 
at the investigation stage and result in violation of the mandate of Section 
173 of the Code. Under the prevailing scheme of the law, the investigating 
agency and the prosecution department operate in profound collaboration. 
According to Section 12 of The Prosecution Act, upon registration of a 
criminal case, it is mandatory to forward a copy of the crime report to the 
District Public Prosecutor forthwith. The investigation officer is obliged to 
deliver the investigation report to the designated prosecutor within the 
prescribed period and if the investigation extends beyond the allotted 
timeframe, the officer must document the reasons and duly inform the 
prosecutor of these extenuating circumstances.  

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(11) 
17. 
The essence of the duty prescribed for the investigating officer towards 
the prosecution is to engage the prosecution from the inception of a criminal 
case, forging a partnership of vigilance. This responsibility bestows upon the 
prosecution the role of a watchdog, tasked with overseeing the punctual 
submission of investigation reports. Through this shared vigilance, the timely 
submission of investigation reports can be assured, ensuring the seamless 
progression of criminal cases. When an investigation report is delayed, the 
responsibility does not rest solely with the investigating agency; the 
prosecution department must also shoulder its share of accountability, as 
mandated by The Prosecution Act. This dual responsibility emphasizes the 
collaborative nature of their roles in the timely submission of investigation 
reports. As discussed above, under Section 13(9)(d) of The Prosecution Act, 
a prosecutor is obliged to report any delays in the submission of investigation 
reports to the District Public Prosecutor. This issue may also be escalated to 
the district head of investigation and the Prosecutor General, paving the way 
for necessary actions against the investigating officer. If a prosecutor fails to 
fulfill this mandatory duty, proceedings should also be initiated against him 
under The Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service Inspectorate Act, 2018 
(hereinafter „The Inspectorate Act‟).  
Role of a Magistrate  
18. 
The Area Magistrate holds the paramount responsibility of overseeing 
every investigation conducted within his jurisdiction.3 It is his bounden duty 
to ensure that the investigation of each criminal case is carried out with 
steadfast adherence to the law. It was already authoritatively observed in 
landmark judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Hakeem 
Mumtaz supra that: -  
“On completion of period of police remand under section 167, 
Cr.P.C. if final or interim report has not been submitted the 
Magistrate before whom accused has been produced for

(12) 
remand can insist upon the prosecution by passing order in 
writing to comply with the provisions of section 173(1). Cr.P.C. 
or record reasons for remanding the accused to judicial 
custody for want of challan in terms of section 344, Cr.P.C. 
and 
simultaneously 
direct 
initiation 
of 
departmental 
proceedings against police officer responsible for submission 
of challan for not complying with mandatory provision of law 
and proving thereby himself/themselves to be inefficient police 
officers, the positive result shall start coming forward.” 
The law distinctly delineates the distinction between remand to police 
custody, as regulated under Section 167 of the Code, and remand to judicial 
custody, governed by Section 344 of the same Code. Section 344 of the Code 
envisages that no extension of judicial remand shall be granted without 
reasonable cause, thereby safeguarding the liberty of the accused against 
arbitrary detention. „Reasonable cause‟ is a legal standard that requires a 
justification rooted in logic and facts, demonstrating that the extension of 
judicial remand is necessary and warranted under the circumstances. This 
concept is pivotal in preventing arbitrary and unjust detention, ensuring that 
any decision to prolong custody is grounded in objective and rational 
considerations. The requirement of demonstrating reasonable cause under 
Section 344 of the Code for the extension of judicial remand serves as an 
effective judicial check on the investigating agency and prosecution, 
guarding against undue delay in submitting the investigation report. 
Magistrates who extend judicial remand without the submission of an 
investigation report in the absence of reasonable cause, in effect, become 
complicit in the illegality perpetrated by the investigating agency or the 
prosecution. The true essence of Section 344 of the Code lies in its ability to 
prevent abuses of power by the police or prosecution through the withholding 
of investigation reports. It is high time that Magistrates, as judicial officers, 
recognize their duty to eradicate the issue of delayed submission of 
investigation reports by rigorously applying Section 344 of the Code. By 
doing so, they can ensure justice is served promptly and uphold the integrity 
of the legal process.  

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(13) 
19. 
According to the Lahore High Court Rules and Orders, any order to 
grant or extend judicial remand must explicitly demonstrate good grounds. 
The relevant Rule, which highlights the necessity for well-founded 
justification, has been reproduced hereinafter for further elucidation: -  
10. Procedure when a remand for more than 15 days is 
required for completion of the case.-- If the limit of 15 days 
has elapsed, and there is still need for further investigation by 
the Police, the procedure to be adopted is that laid down in 
section 344, Criminal Procedure Code. The case is brought on to 
the Magistrate’s file and the accused, if detention is necessary, 
will remain in magisterial custody. The case may be postponed 
or adjourned from time to time for periods of not more than 15 
days each, and as each adjournment expires the accused must be 
produced before the Magistrate, and the order of adjournment 
must show good reasons for making the order.4 
In the case of Rehan supra, the Supreme Court of Pakistan gave a reminder 
regarding the imperative duty of the courts to ensure the swift submission of 
investigation reports and the prompt commencement of trials. This ruling 
serves as a stern reminder to uphold statutory obligations and prioritize the 
expeditious administration of justice. 
Section 344, Cr.P.C. casts a heavy duty on the Court to 
commence the trial as early as possible and not to adjourn 
the case on flimsy grounds. It is also duty of the Court to 
ensure submission of complete challan/final report under 
section 173, Cr.P.C. without any unnecessary delay. 
20. 
Moreover, the instructions issued by the Director General Directorate 
of District Judiciary of this Court vide letter No. 11125/DDJ/MNT, explicitly 
mandate 
that 
Magistrates 
must 
actively 
fulfill 
their 
supervisory 
responsibilities to ensure the timely submission of reports under Section 173 
of the Code. According to these directives, each Area Magistrate is obligated 
to maintain a meticulously detailed register. This register should record the 
dates of the lodging of the First Information Report (FIR), the commitment of 
the accused to judicial custody, and the due date for the submission of the 
report under Section 173 of the Code. Furthermore, it was emphatically 
                                       
4 Rule 10 of Volume – III, Chapter 11Part B of The Lahore High Court Rules and orders.  

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(14) 
stated that the submission of an interim report cannot and should not be 
considered a substitute for the comprehensive report required under Section 
173 of the Code. Magistrates must exercise vigilance and diligence to 
guarantee the prompt submission of the complete investigation report. To this 
end, they are instructed to issue necessary directives to the concerned Station 
House Officer (SHO), thereby ensuring that the complete investigation 
reports are submitted as expeditiously as possible. 
Criminal Justice Coordination Committee  
21. 
Under Article 109 of the Police Order, 2002, a Criminal Justice 
Coordination Committee (CJCC) shall be established in every District. This 
committee is to be chaired by the District and Sessions Judge, with its 
members comprising the District Police Officer, the District Public 
Prosecutor, the District Superintendent of Jail, the District Probation Officer, 
the District Parole Officer, and the Head of Investigation. Under Article 111 
of the Police Order, 2002, the CJCC is entrusted with a comprehensive 
mandate to ensure the seamless operation and continual improvement of the 
criminal justice system. The CJCC is dedicated to developing understanding, 
cooperation, and coordination within the administration of the criminal 
justice system. It is pertinent to note that the instructions issued by the 
Director General of the Directorate of District Judiciary were intended to 
guide and ensure the effective, meaningful, and dynamic convening of CJCC 
meetings. These meetings were designed to address the issue of unnoticed 
delays in the submission of reports under Section 173 of the Code. However, 
it appears that these instructions were never faithfully followed. The case at 
hand exemplifies the poor performance and ineffectiveness of the CJCC, as 
this matter was neglected and remained unresolved. It raises serious 
questions regarding the performance of the CJCC, functioning under the 
supervision of a senior judicial officer. Effective and meaningful meetings of 
CJCC taking up the issue of delayed submission of investigation reports 
could have addressed the late submission of investigation report in this case.

District and Sessions Judge and Superintendent of Prison.  
22. 
Under Rule 395 of the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978, every Sessions 
Judge and the Officer Incharge of Prosecution are required to visit the 
undertrial prisoners in their jurisdiction once a month. This rule aims to 
identify and address cases of undue delay. It also mandates the 
Superintendent of the Prison to submit a monthly list to the District and 
Sessions Judge, the Officer Incharge of Prosecution, and the Inspector 
General (Prisons), detailing the names and particulars of all undertrial 
prisoners detained for over three months, excluding those committed to 
Sessions. The primary objective of these monthly visits by the District and 
Sessions Judge is to relieve the hardships of the prisoners and ensure strict 
adherence to the law. In the present case, the effective implementation of this 
rule could have resolved the issue at hand, but regrettably, it was not 
enforced. 
23. 
The foregoing discussion clearly reveals that the timely submission of 
investigation reports is not solely the duty of the investigating agency. 
Rather, it is a shared responsibility among the concerned Prosecutors, Area 
Magistrates, Criminal Justice Coordination Committees, and Superintendents 
of Prisons. Regrettably, all these stakeholders have previously failed to fulfill 
their duties. We are therefore compelled to issue the following directions to 
ensure that investigation reports reach the trial court within the stipulated 
time, leaving no stone unturned to uphold the integrity of the criminal justice 
system. 
 
I. 
The Investigating Officers, Prosecutors, District and Sessions 
Judges, Area Magistrates, Criminal Justice Coordination 
Committees and Jail Superintendents shall strictly adhere to the 
principles enunciated in the case of Hakeem Mumtaz supra, as 
mandated by Articles 189 and 190 of the Constitution and 
directions issued hereinabove, without further failure.  

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(16) 
II. 
The instructions issued by the Director General of the 
Directorate of District Judiciary of this Court, pursuant to the 
honorable 
authority’s 
sanction, 
as 
per 
letter 
No. 
11125/DDJ/MNT dated 26.07.2021, must be strictly observed to 
ensure the timely submission of investigation reports. These 
instructions encompass comprehensive guidelines for District & 
Sessions Judges, Judicial Magistrates, and Trial Courts to uphold 
justice and address delays in submitting investigation reports. 
The Director General of District Judiciary shall recirculate these 
instructions at the earliest for their compliance. 
III. The Secretary Public Prosecution Department, Government of 
Punjab and the Prosecutor General Punjab shall promptly 
address the issue. They shall also submit a report via the 
Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of this Court for review in 
Chambers. The Secretary Public Prosecution Department, 
Government of Punjab, shall also address the inefficacy and 
poor performance of the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service 
Inspectorate, ensuring that The Inspectorate Act is implemented 
in its full letter and spirit for effective internal accountability of 
delinquents. 
IV. Should the investigating officer fail to submit an investigation 
report within the stipulated timeframe, the concerned 
prosecutor shall notify the relevant Superintendent of Police 
(Investigation) to initiate legal proceedings against the 
delinquent. The matter shall also be reported to the Area 
Magistrate, who is overall incharge of the investigation, for 
further action against the negligent investigating officer. 
V. 
The Provincial Police Officer (PPO), Punjab, shall ensure the 
timely submission of the investigation reports in strict 
compliance of Section 173 of the Code. Each Divisional 

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(17) 
Superintendent of Police (Investigation) shall supervise the 
timely submission of investigation reports and all negligent 
investigating officers shall be subjected to strict legal 
proceedings. In case of supervisory lapses, the concerned 
Superintendent of Police (Investigation) shall be held 
accountable. 
VI. Criminal Justice Coordination Committees throughout the 
province shall prioritize the issue of timely submission of 
investigation reports in every meeting, ensuring that necessary 
actions are taken without delay. The CJCC carries a significant 
statutory duty to monitor the overall working of criminal justice 
system and any slackness on part of any of the stakeholders 
should not go unnoticed.  
VII. 
Every Superintendent of Prison, as a member of the CJCC, shall 
present a report regarding the prisoners incarcerated without 
submission of the investigation reports to the trial courts, 
ensuring that no one is detained without a timely charge sheet 
submission. The Inspector General (Prisons), Punjab, shall 
address this issue and ensure that every Superintendent of Prison 
within the province performs his duties in strict accordance with 
The Prisons Act, 1894, and Pakistan Prisons Rules, 1978. 
VIII. 
All Area Magistrates shall ensure strict compliance with Section 
344 of the Code while granting or extending judicial remands of 
an accused person. They shall also ensure that investigation 
reports are submitted within the stipulated timeframe for every 
criminal case registered within their jurisdiction. In case of 
failure of the investigating officer to submit the investigation 
report within the stipulated time, the matter shall be reported to 
his supervisory officer for appropriate strict action. 

Crl. Misc. No.1979-B/2024  
 
 
(18) 
IX. 
Achieving timely submission of investigation reports requires an 
effective supervisory regime and accountability at all levels. 
This accountability must begin at the top and trickle down to 
ground-level officers, creating a culture of responsibility and 
diligence. Only with such an effective supervisory framework 
can the timely submission of investigation reports become a 
reality, turning a distant goal into a guaranteed outcome. Copies 
of this judgment shall be sent to all the concerned for strict 
compliance through the Registrar’s Office of this Court.  
24. 
After extensive arguments presented by the learned counsel for the 
petitioners, it has been requested to withdraw the bail petition. Accordingly, 
the petition is hereby dismissed as withdrawn. The trial court is urged to 
expedite the trial proceedings without any undue delay.
