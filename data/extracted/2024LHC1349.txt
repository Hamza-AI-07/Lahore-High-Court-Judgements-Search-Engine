MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. The petitioner herein after 
spending considerable time abroad returned to his home land and 
decided to establish a garments factory. For the said purpose the 
petitioner applied to the Punjab Small Industries Corporation, 
Jhelum for allotment of a commercial plot measuring 02 Kanal. It is 
the claim of the petitioner that after the allotment, he deposited the 
amount due in furtherance whereof, possession was delivered to him 
but the respondent-Corporation confronted him with the demand at 
the rate of Rs.1,00,000/- per Kanal instead of Rs.52,000/- per Kanal 
as agreed and settled originally. On receipt of notices from the 
respondent-Corporation, the petitioner instituted a suit for 
declaration, permanent and mandatory injunction, which was resisted 
by the respondent-Corporation, while submitting written statement 
wherein it is asserted that the petitioner obtained the suit plot at the 

Civil Revision No.33-D of 2022 
-2- 
 
rate of Rs.1,00,000/- per Kanal and to this effect he also submitted 
an undertaking dated 06th October, 1994 accepting the price 
alongwith interest of 15%. From the divergent pleadings of the 
parties, learned Civil Judge Class-I, Jhelum framed multiple issues. 
After framing of issues, evidence of both the sides was recorded and 
ultimately suit was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 04th 
December, 2010. Feeling dissatisfied the petitioner though preferred 
an appeal before the learned Additional District Judge, Sohawa 
District Jhelum but remained unsuccessful as it was also dismissed 
through judgment and decree dated 28th October, 2021, hence this 
petition under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 
1908) (hereinafter referred to as “C.P.C.”). 
2. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner 
is the valid allottee of the suit plot. He added that at the time of 
allotment the rate of the suit plot was determined as Rs.52,000/- per 
Kanal and the petitioner paid the whole consideration. It is 
contended with vehemence by learned counsel for the petitioner that 
later on the respondent-Corporation demanded sale price at the rate 
of Rs.1,00,000/- per Kanal, which demand was illegal and unlawful. 
Learned counsel emphasized that the petitioner has been non-suited 
on extraneous grounds and the impugned judgments and decrees are 
though concurrent but are not tenable. 
3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent-Corporation 
submitted that the petitioner was obliged to pay the sale price at the 
rate of Rs.1,00,000/- per Kanal but despite repeated demands he 
failed to deposit the same. Learned counsel contended that the 
petitioner has no vested right to seek enforcement of contract 
through a suit for declaration and as such he was rightly non-suited 
by the courts below. Learned counsel emphasized that there are 
concurrent findings of the facts of the courts below and this revision 
petition is not maintainable. 
4. 
Heard. Record perused. 

Civil Revision No.33-D of 2022 
-3- 
 
5. 
The petitioner after his return from abroad applied to the 
respondent-Corporation for a commercial plot to establish a 
garments factory. It is the claim of the petitioner that suit plot was 
allotted to him at the rate of Rs.52,000/- per Kanal as sale price, 
which he deposited on 06th October, 1994 and in pursuance thereof 
he was also handed over possession of the suit plot whereafter he 
raised construction. The grievance of the petitioner is that after 
afflux of sometime the respondent-Corporation issued him letter 
asking to pay the sale price at the rate of Rs.1,00,000/- per Kanal, 
which is totally unwarranted. While resisting the suit, the 
respondent-Corporation pleaded that the sale price of the suit plot 
was Rs.1,00,000/- per Kanal and the petitioner though established 
the garments factory upon the suit plot but he failed to pay the sale 
price at the actual rate. It is also pleaded that the petitioner to this 
effect submitted an undertaking as well. From the analysis of the 
respective pleadings of the parties it is an admitted position that suit 
plot was allotted to the petitioner and after payment of sale price, he 
was handed over the possession whereafter he established a garments 
factory. 
6. 
The moot point which thus emerges from the pleadings is 
restricted to the actual sale price of the suit plot. As per claim of the 
petitioner, suit plot was allotted to him at the rate of Rs.52,000/- per 
Kanal whereas respondent-Corporation is of the view that it was 
Rs.1,00,000/- per Kanal. In order to prove his claim, the petitioner 
examined Muhammad Zaheer as PW1 whereas he himself appeared 
as PW2. The petitioner also produced documentary evidence in 
addition to the oral account. On the contrary, the respondent-
Corporation produced Muhammad Tahir, Deputy Director Punjab 
Small Industries Corporation, Jhelum as DW1 whereas documentary 
evidence was also brought on record to rebut the claim of the 
petitioner. 
7. 
It appears from the record that initially on dismissal of his suit, 
the petitioner preferred an appeal before the learned Additional 
District Judge, Jhelum Camp at Sohawa, which was dismissed by 

Civil Revision No.33-D of 2022 
-4- 
 
way of judgment and decree dated 02nd July, 2015. Feeling 
dissatisfied the petitioner filed Civil Revision No.663-D of 2015 
before this Court, which was allowed vide judgment dated 22nd 
April, 2021 with the following observations :- 
“6.  
After having an overview of the well-settled principles 
noted hereinabove, I am of the considered opinion that the 
impugned judgment and decree dated 2nd July, 2015 passed by 
the learned Additional District Judge, Jhelum (Camp at 
Sohawa) cannot sustain, so without touching other merits of the 
case lest it prejudice to the case of either of the side, with 
consent instant petition is accepted, as a result thereof, 
impugned judgment and decree is set aside. Resultantly appeal 
alongwith application for additional evidence filed by the 
petitioner shall be deemed to be pending before the learned 
Additional District Judge, Sohawa-I, who shall decide the same 
afresh, while taking into account observations made 
hereinabove. Needless to observe that the court, seized with the 
matter, shall first attend the application for additional evidence 
and after deciding the same by way of an independent order 
with due application of judicious mind then attend the merits of 
the appeal and decide the same accordingly thereafter. 
7. 
Keeping in view the pendency of this litigation for a 
considerable period i.e. since 2005, it is expected that the 
appeal shall be decided within two months from the date of 
first appearance of the parties before the Court, seized with the 
matter. Office to transmit copy of this judgment to the Court 
concerned for compliance. Parties to appear before the learned 
Additional District Judge-I, Sohawa on 19.05.2021.” 
In pursuance to the above said judgment of this Court, the 
application for additional evidence was allowed with consent of the 
respondent-Corporation in furtherance whereof document (Exhibit-
P12) was made part of record. 
8. 
As already observed that the only resistance on the part of 
respondent-Corporation to the suit is that the actual sale price is 
Rs.1,00,000/- per Kanal and not Rs.52,000/- per Kanal as asserted by 
the petitioner, so in this eventuality they were obliged to lead 
tangible evidence and to discharge the onus. Muhammad Tahir, 
Deputy Director Punjab Small Industries Corporation, appeared on 
behalf of respondent-Corporation and his whole statement revolves 
around the undertaking submitted by the petitioner. Before adverting 
to the validity of said undertaking it would be advantageous to 
highlight some of the extract from the statement of DW1, which in 
my estimation would be sufficient to resolve the matter in issue :- 

Civil Revision No.33-D of 2022 
-5- 
 
 
It is thus apparent from the statement of said witness that 
Rs.1,00,000/- per Kanal as sale price of suit plot was demanded by 
the respondent-Corporation on the basis of decision taken in the 
meeting dated 26th October, 1994, which was made part of record by 
the respondent-Corporation through C.M. No.109-C of 2024. In 
terms whereof following decision was taken :- 
“03. 
Each and every issue was discussed in detail and the following 
decisions were taken :- 
i) 
PRICE OF THE PLOTS: 
It was explained by the Joint 
Director (F&B) that the entire amount for the establishment of 
Small Industries Estate, Jhelum was provided by the Government 
as interest-bearing loan and, therefore, a huge amount of 
Rs.203.10 Lacs was payable to the Government, which would 
increase after the reconciliation of accounts with Finance 
Department, Government of the Punjab. Keeping in view the 
financial liability, it was decided that the price of plot per Kanal 
in Small Industries Estate, Jhelum should be fixed at a flat rate of 
Rs.1,00 Lac subject to review in the 1st  Week of July, 1995. The 
revised price would be applicable with immediate effect and all 
previous allotments shall be governed by the Pricing Policy 
already intimated vide letter No.PSIC/C&D/AD-I/9160 dated 
10.12.1987. It was also decided to recover full cost of the plots at 
the time of allotment under the new Pricing Policy. Both the 
Regional Director and the Deputy Director (Estate), Jhelum were 
of the view that it was a reasonable price and, therefore, they 
would not face any difficulty in disposing off all the remaining 
plots at revised rates. Regional Director and Deputy Director 
(Estate) will regularly inform to Head Office of the progress 
made towards the selling of vacant plots at the new rates.” 
 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 

Civil Revision No.33-D of 2022 
-6- 
 
From the bare perusal of the extract of the policy reproduced 
hereinabove it is manifestly clear that price of the plot at the rate of 
Rs.1,00,000/- was made applidable from the date of decision 
whereas all the previous allotments were saved and decided to be 
governed by the previous policy. As per previous policy, the price of 
plot in the Punjab Small Industries, Jhelum was Rs.52,000/- per 
Kanal which fact is even not refuted by the learned counsel for the 
respondent-Corporation. 
9. 
So far claim of respondent-Corporation is concerned, that is 
rested upon application for allotment (Exhibit-D1) and undertaking 
submitted by the petitioner it is observed that both these documents 
were never confronted to the petitioner and the same were made part 
of record through the statement of counsel. Article 78 of the Qanun-
e-Shahadat Order, 1984, which is akin to Section 67 of the Evidence 
Act, 1872 lays down the mode of proof of execution of document. 
Any document which is brought on the record without adhering the 
mandatory provisions would not be admissible.  
10. 
In the case of Mst. AKHTAR SULTANA versus Major Retd. 
MUZAFFAR KHAN MALIK through his legal heirs and others (PLD 2021 
Supreme Court 715) the Supreme Court of Pakistan outlined the true 
import of the relevant provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984 dealing with the relevancy and admissibility of the 
documentary evidence. The relevant extract from the same is 
reproduced below : - 
“(i) Relevant and admissible evidence  
10. The Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 ("Qanun-e-Shahadat") 
governs the law of evidence in our country. The expression 
"relevancy" and "admissibility" have their own distinct legal 
implications under the Qanun-e-Shahadat as, more often than 
not, facts which are relevant may not be admissible. On the one 
hand, a fact is "relevant" if it is logically probative or 
disprobative of the fact-in-issue, which requires proof. On the 
other hand, a fact is "admissible" if it is relevant and not 
excluded by any exclusionary provision, express or implied. 
What is to be understood is that unlike "relevance", which is 
factual and determined solely by reference to the logical 
relationship between the fact claimed to be relevant and the 
fact-in-issue, "admissibility" is a matter of law. Thus, a 
"relevant" fact would be "admissible" unless it is excluded 
from being admitted, or is required to be proved in a particular 
mode(s) before it can be admitted as evidence, by the 

Civil Revision No.33-D of 2022 
-7- 
 
provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat. As far as the latter is 
concerned, and that too relating to documents, admissibility is 
of two types: (i) admissible subject to proof, and (ii) admissible 
per se, that is, when the document is admitted in evidence 
without requiring proof. 
(ii) Mode of proof  
11. Mode of proof is the procedure by which the "relevant" and 
"admissible" facts have to be proved, the manner whereof has 
been prescribed in Articles 70-89 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat. In 
other words, a "relevant" and "admissible" fact is admitted as a 
piece of evidence, only when the same has been proved by the 
party asserting the same. In this regard, the foundational 
principle governing proof of contents of documents is that the 
same are to be proved by producing "primary evidence" or 
"secondary evidence". The latter is only permissible in certain 
prescribed circumstances, which have been expressly provided 
in the Qanun-e-Shahadat.  
12. What is important to note is that, as a general principle, an 
objection as to inadmissibility of a document can be raised at 
any stage of the case, even if it had not been taken when the 
document was tendered in evidence. However, the objection as 
to the mode of proving contents of a document or its execution 
is to be taken, when a particular mode is adopted by the party 
at the evidence-recording stage during trial. The latter kind of  
objection cannot be allowed to be raised, for the first time, at 
any subsequent stage. This principle is based on the rule of fair 
play. As if the objection regarding the mode of proof adopted 
has been taken at the appropriate stage, it would have enabled 
the party tendering the evidence to cure the defect and resort to 
other mode of proof. The omission to object at the appropriate 
stage becomes fatal because, by his failure, the party entitled to 
object allows the party tendering the evidence to act on 
assumption that he has no objection about the mode of proof 
adopted. 
13. It is also important to note that the objection as to "mode of 
proof" should not be confused with the objection of "absence 
of proof". Absence of proof goes to the very root of 
admissibility of the document as a piece of evidence; therefore, 
this objection can be raised at any stage, as the first proviso to 
Article 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat commands that "the 
judgment must be based upon facts declared by this Order to be 
relevant, and duly proved". In other words, when the Qanun-e-
Shahadat provides several modes of proving a relevant fact and 
a party adopts a particular mode that is permissible only in 
certain circumstances, the failure to take objection when that 
mode is adopted, estops the opposing party to raise, at a 
subsequent stage, the objection to the mode of proof adopted. 
However, when the Qanun-e-Shahadat provides only one mode 
of proving a relevant fact and that mode is not adopted, or 
when it provides several modes of proving a relevant fact and 
none of them is adopted, such a case falls within the purview of 
"absence of proof", and not "mode of proof"; therefore, the 
objection thereto can be taken at any stage, even if it has not 
earlier been taken. 
(iii) Evidentiary value  
14. Once a fact crosses the threshold of "relevancy", 
"admissibility" and "proof", as mandated under the provisions 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, would it be said to be admitted, for 

Civil Revision No.33-D of 2022 
-8- 
 
its evidentiary value to be adjudged by the trial court. The 
evidentiary value or in other words, weight of evidence, is 
actually a qualitative assessment made by the trial judge of the 
probative value of the proved fact. Unlike "admissibility", the 
evidentiary value of a piece of evidence cannot be determined 
by fixed rules, since it depends mainly on common sense, logic 
and experience and is determined by the trial judge, keeping in 
view the peculiarities of each case.” 
To the above effect guidance can also be sought from MANZOOR 
HUSSAIN (deceased) through L.Rs. versus MISRI KHAN (PLD 2020 Supreme 
Court 749) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under :- 
“4. 
Before parting with this case we would like to 
comment 
on 
a 
related 
matter. 
Copies 
of 
the 
acknowledgement receipt (exhibit P4), aks shajarah kishtwar 
(exhibit P2), registered post receipt (exhibit P3), mutation 
(exhibit P5) and jamabandi for the year 2000-2001 (exhibit 
P6) were produced and exhibited by the pre-emptor's 
counsel, but without him testifying. We have noted that 
copies of documents, having no concern with counsel, are 
often tendered in evidence through a simple statement of 
counsel but without administering an oath to him and 
without him testifying, especially in the province of Punjab. 
Ordinarily, documents are produced through a witness who 
testifies on oath and who may be cross-examined by the 
other side. However, there are exceptions with regard to 
facts which need not be proved; these are those which the 
Court will take judicial notice of under Article 111 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and are mentioned in Article 
112, and facts which are admitted (Article 113, Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984). 
5. 
The acknowledgement receipt was stated to have 
been signed when the envelope said to contain the Talb-i-
Ishhad notice was purportedly received by the respondent. 
However, the respondent had not admitted receipt of the said 
notice, therefore, the acknowledgement receipt (exhibit P4) 
could not be stated to be an admitted document and did not 
constitute an admitted fact. Therefore, delivery to and/or 
receipt by the respondent of the notice had to be established. 
We also note that in this case the said counsel had furnished 
copies of all five documents (exhibits P2 to P6), which were 
produced by him. The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 
explicitly sets out the documents which must be produced in 
original, which in the present case would be the registered 
post receipt (exhibit P3) and acknowledgment receipt 
(exhibit P4), and photo copies, that is secondary evidence, 
could only be produced as permitted; and as regards extracts 
of official records, that is, the aks shajarah kishtwar (exhibit 
P2), mutation (exhibit P5) and jamabandi (exhibit P6), 
certified copies thereof had to be tendered in evidence. In 
not 
observing 
the 
rules 
of 
evidence 
unnecessary 
complications for litigants are created, which may result in 
avoidable adverse orders or in the case being remanded on 
such score, which would be avoided by abiding by the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.” 
The above principles were even reiterated by this Court in the case of 
NATIONAL COMMAND AUTHORITY through D.G. SPD, Rawalpindi and 

Civil Revision No.33-D of 2022 
-9- 
 
others versus ZAHOOR AZAM and others (2024 CLC 1). After having an 
overview of the principles noted hereinabove it can be held without 
any hint of doubt that the document (Exhibit-D1) and undertaking 
submitted by the petitioner would be nothing except stray papers in 
the eye of law.  
11. 
It would not be out of context to mention here that with regard 
to the undertaking it is specific stance of the petitioner that it was 
obtained by the respondent-Corporation later on and the column of 
price was kept blank on the asking of concerned officer of 
Corporation at the time of its submission, which was later on filled 
up by respondents themselves. This stance of the petitioner finds due 
support from the statement of Muhammad Tahir (DW1) as 
reproduced hereinabove. It is an oft repeated principle of law that 
disputed documents cannot be tendered in evidence through the 
statement of counsel of the party. The reason for such restriction is 
that through such procedure the opposing party becomes deprived to 
challenge the authenticity of such document by way of cross-
examination. Guidance to this effect can be sought from Mst. AKHTAR 
SULTANA versus Major Retd. MUZAFFAR KHAN MALIK through his legal 
heirs and others (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 715) and Khan MUHAMMAD 
YUSUF KHAN KHATTAK versus S. M. AYUB AND 2 OTHERS (PLD 1973 
Supreme Court 160). 
12. 
It clearly emerges from the record that at the time of allotment 
of the suit plot to the petitioner, the new policy which has been 
pressed into service by the respondent-Corporation to claim sale 
price of Rs.1,00,000/- per Kanal, was not in operation at all. In such 
situation even an undertaking from the petitioner, which though is 
seriously refuted by him would not be sufficient to hold that he was 
liable to pay Rs.1,00,000/- per Kanal as sale price of the suit plot.  
13. 
There are though concurrent findings of facts recorded by both 
the courts blow but such findings are clearly the outcome of gross 
misreading and non-reading of evidence. The scope of revisional 
jurisdiction is hedged in Section 115 of “C.P.C.” and though 
ordinarily concurrent findings of facts are not disturbed but such 

Civil Revision No.33-D of 2022 
-10- 
 
findings are neither sacrosanct nor it is an inflexible rule that despite 
observing material flaws, the revisional court will abdicate to 
exercise its jurisdiction. The judgments passed by the courts below 
are not based on proper appraisal of evidence and the learned Civil 
Judge, while dismissing the suit of the petitioner has grossly misread 
the evidence as already noted hereinabove. The appellate court in the 
circumstances, while upholding the judgment and decree of trial 
court thus committed a material irregularity. This Court under 
Section 115 of “C.P.C.” is thus obliged and fully competent to 
correct such error in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction. Needless 
to observe that when once it is established on the record that 
concurrent findings are fraught with legal infirmities, it becomes the 
bounden duty of court exercising revisional powers to curb and stifle 
such illegalities and material irregularities. Reference in this respect, 
if needed, can be made to Malik MUHAMMAD KHAQAN versus 
TRUSTEES OF THE PORT OF KARACHI (KPT) and another (2008 SCMR 
428) and IMAM DIN and 4 others versus BASHIR AHMED and 10 others 
(PLD 2005 Supreme Court 418). 
14. 
For the foregoing reasons, the instant petition is allowed, 
impugned judgments and decrees are set aside, as a result thereof, 
suit instituted by the petitioner shall stand decreed with no order as 
to costs.
