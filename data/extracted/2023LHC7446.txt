Kalashnikov while Mujahid was armed with 30 bore pistol. Both the said accused 
persons fired burst on the back side of Muhammad Asghar S/o Muhammad 
Aslam, who was sitting on rear seat of the motor cycle. Due to which he sustained 
injuries and fell down on the ground. The said both accused persons fired on him

necessary documents. We did not go near them due to fear/terror caused by the 
said accused persons. This occurrence was witnessed by Muhammad Rizwan S/o

OPINION 
 
In my opinion, the cause of death was injuries No. 1 to 9 which were 
injury to vital organ, brain lungs. These injuries were sufficient to cause death in 
ordinary course of life. All the injuries were antemortem in nature and due to 
firearm. Probable time between injuries and death instantaneously and between 
death and postmortem was 8 to 9 hours. 
7.    
On 22.11.2017, the learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up the 
prosecution witnesses namely Saif ur Rehman,Ghulam Haider, Rana Muhammad 
Afzal and Mukhtiar as being won over by the accused and gave up the prosecution 
witnesses namely Asim Razzaq and Muhammad Shafique T/ASI as being 
unnecessary. On 13.03.2018, the learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave 
up the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Fayyaz 2039/C as being 
unnecessary.  On 26.06.2018, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor gave 
up the prosecution witnesses namely Zulifqar Ali, Inspector, Muhammad Gulzar 
Inspector and Tahir Mahmood, SI  as being unnecessary . On 08.01.2019, the 
learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor gave up the prosecution witnesses 
Mohsin Ali and Abdul Ghafoor as being unnecessary and closed the prosecution 
evidence after tendering the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
(Exh.PV)  regarding the analysis of the blood stained earth, the reports of the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. PW and Exh. PX), the judgment of 
learned trial court in case F.I.R 324 of 2014 (Exh.PY), warrants of arrest  (Exh. 
PZ)  of  the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed and proclamation (Exh.PZ/1). 
8. 
The learned trial court also recorded the statements of Tahir Masood, SI 
(CW-1) as a court witness who investigated the case from 01.06.2016 till 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019

28.06.02016 and detailed the facts of the investigation as conducted by him in his 
statement before the learned trial court.  
9. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court examined 
the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed son of Nazar Hussain   under section 342 
Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question why this case against you and why the PWs 
have deposed against you, he replied that he had been involved in the case falsely 
and was innocent. The appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed son of Nazar Hussain   opted 
not to get himself examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. and did not adduce any 
evidence in his defence.  
10. 
On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge,  
Multan convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to above.   
 
11. 
The primary contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the 
whole case is fabricated and false. The learned counsel for the appellant argued 
that the prosecution remained unable to prove the facts in issue and did not 
produce any unimpeachable, admissible and relevant evidence to prove the same. 
The learned counsel for the appellant further contended that the statements of the 
eye witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)   
were not worthy of any reliance. The learned counsel for the appellant also argued 
that the recovery of the Kalashnikov rifle (P-11) from the possession of the 
appellant could not be proved. The learned counsel for the appellant finally 
submitted that the prosecution had totally failed to prove the case against the 
appellant beyond the shadow of doubt.

12. 
  On the other hand, the learned Additional Prosecutor General along with 
the learned counsel for the complainant contended that the prosecution had proved 
its case beyond shadow of doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned 
Additional Prosecutor General along with the learned counsel for the complainant 
further argued that the deceased died as a result of injuries suffered at the hands of 
the appellant. The learned Additional Prosecutor General along with the learned 
counsel for the complainant further contended that the medical evidence also 
corroborated the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2). The learned Additional Prosecutor 
General and the learned counsel for the complainant contended that there was no 
occasion for the prosecution witnesses, who were related to the deceased, to 
substitute the real offenders with the innocent in this case. The learned Additional 
Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the complainant prayed for the 
rejection of the appeal as lodged by the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed. The learned 
counsel for the complainant also argued that the Criminal Appeal No.588 of 2019, 
assailing the acquittal of Muhammad Khan, Shabbir Ahmad, Muhammad Iqbal, 
Muhammad Azeem, Mujahid Hussain, Mudassar and Faraz by the learned trial 
court from the charges also merited acceptance. 
13. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned counsel for 
the complainant, the learned Additional Prosecutor General and with their 
assistance carefully perused the record and evidence recorded during the trial. 
14. 
 The instant case relates to the Qatl-i-Amd of  two deceased namely Ch. 
Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad Ibrahim  and Muhammad Asghar son of 
Muhammad Aslam.. A perusal of the prosecution evidence reveals that the whole 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
12 
 
prosecution case as against the appellant  namely Ejaz Ahmed is based on the 
statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and 
Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2). The ocular account of the incident was narrated by 
the said prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)   and Muhammad 
Rizwan (PW-2) . The relationship of the said witnesses with the deceased namely 
Ch. Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad Ibrahim is on record. Ch. Muhammad 
Asghar son of Muhammad Ibrahim (deceased) was the brother of the prosecution 
witness namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and the paternal uncle of the prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) . The prosecution witnesses namely 
Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) were also admittedly not 
the residents of the place of occurrence. According to the prosecution witnesses 
namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) , both of them had 
their residence at a distance of about as much as about 2  kilometres from the place 
of occurrence. The prosecution witness namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1), during 
cross-examination stated as under:- 
“Place of occurrence is situated at about a distance of 2 km from my house. 
……………. 
It is correct that the alleged occurrence took place in the area of 09-T Jahanian 
Road.” 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) during cross-
examination stated as under:- 
“My house is at the distance of 2 KM from the place of occurrence ” 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
13 
 
In this manner, both the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)    and 
Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)  can be validly termed as “chance witnesses” and 
therefore were under a bounden duty to provide a convincing reason for their 
presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence and were also under a 
duty to prove their presence by producing some physical proof of the same. We 
have noted with grave concern that the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul 
Razzaq (PW-1)   and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)   failed miserably to provide any 
consistent evidence as to the reason for their arrival at the place of occurrence and 
their presence at the place of occurrence when the same was taking place. Being 
conscious of the fact that the occurrence had taken place on a road which was  at a 
distance of about two kilometres from their residence, both the prosecution 
witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) stated 
that the reason for their arrival at the place of occurrence was that they had 
proceeded to the area of Badhla Sant to offer Juma prayers and when they were 
returning to their house from the Mosque situated within the area of Badhla Sant, 
that they happened to arrive at the place of occurrence and saw the assailants attack 
both the deceased who were at that time travelling on a separate motorcycle. A 
wade  through the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq 
(PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) reveals that the reason given by them for 
having proceeded to the area of Badhla Sant to offer Juma prayers was sham. Both 
the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2) admitted that there were several Mosques within the area of their residence 
where Juma prayers were also offered, however, could not explain their choice of 
not offering the Juma prayers in the said Mosques on the day of occurrence and 
proceeding to the area of Badhla Sant to offer Juma prayers, which Mosque was at 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
14 
 
a distance of as much as four kilometres from their house.  The prosecution witness 
namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) , during cross-examination , admitted as under:- 
“I am resident of Chak No. 1-T Shumali. Volunteered that my residence is not in 
the Abadi of Chak. I am residing at my own land. Abadi of Chak No. 1-T is 
comprised of about 1500/2000 houses. Two mosques are situated in the said 
Chak. In both the mosques, Juma prayer is offered. The Chak 1-T Shumali 
situated at the distance of 1/1 ½ Km from my residence. The Markazi Masjid 
Budla Santt where I went to say my Jumma prayer on the day of occurrence is 
situated at the distance of 4 Km from my residence.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2), during cross-
examination , admitted as under:- 
“.My house is situated in 1/T Shummali. Budhla Sant is situated towards North 
of our house about 4 Km away 
…………… 
The Jumma prayers are offered in the mosques situated near our house” (emphasis 
supplied)  
In this manner, it is abundantly clear that the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul 
Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) had no reason to had proceeded 
to the area of Badhla Sant to offer Juma prayers and the said reason was invented 
to provide justification for their subsequent arrival at the place of occurrence. It is 
also an admitted fact of the prosecution case that not even a single person joined 
the investigation of the case to verify the fact that prior to the occurrence, the 
prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2) had indeed offered Juma prayers in a Mosque situated within the area of 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019

Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
15 
 
Badhla Sant. As mentioned above, when there were as many as two Mosques 
present within the area of the residence of the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul 
Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) where Juma prayers were being 
offered then there did not exist any reason for the prosecution witnesses namely 
Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) to have proceeded to a 
Mosque as much as at a distance of four kilometres from their residence. The 
proven failure of the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and 
Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)   to prove the reason for them to had proceeded to the 
area of Badhla Sant to offer Juma prayers, from the return from which mosque the 
prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2) claimed that they happened to arrive at the place of occurrence and having 
seen the assailants attack both the deceased has repercussions, proves that the very 
inception of the prosecution case was founded in doubt and not proved claims.  
15. 
We have also noted that though it was claimed by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)  that they had gone 
to the place of occurrence on a motorcycle whereas the two deceased were riding a 
separate motorcycle, however, during the course of the investigation as well as 
before the learned trial court, the said motorcycle, allegedly used by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2)  to arrive at the place of occurrence, was not produced. The prosecution 
witness namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) during cross-examination stated as under:- 
“I alongwith Rizwan and Saif ur Rehman went to the mosque on one motor 
cycle. 
…………….

Police had not taken into possession the motor cycle upon which I was riding 
at the at the time of occurrence. 
………… 
I alongwith Rizwan and Saif ur Rehman were on one motor cycle while Asghar 
s/o Ibrahim and Muhammad Asghar s/o Muhammad Aslam were on the other 
motorcycle.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2), during cross-
examination admitted as under:- 
“ When police came at the spot the said motor bike which was in my use was 
present  there I had informed the police about the said motor bike but police had 
not taken it into possession.” (emphasis supplied)  
As mentioned above, Imran Arif, Inspector (PW-16), the Investigating Officer of 
the case, came to the place of occurrence after the occurrence and remained at the 
said place for a considerable time. During the course of his stay at the place of 
occurrence, Imran Arif ,Inspector (PW-16), the Investigating Officer of the case, 
did not take into possession the motorcycle allegedly used by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)  to arrive 
at the place of occurrence, along with the other recoveries, though there was no 
occasion for the said motorcycle not to have been present at the place of 
occurrence or not being taken into possession by the Investigating Officer during 
his visit at the place of the occurrence, if the same was available.  Imran Arif 
,Inspector (PW-16) during cross-examination, made it clear that no such 
motorcycle used by the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
17 
 
Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) to arrive at the place of occurrence was even seen by 
him at the place of occurrence and stated as under:- 
“I did not take into possession the motorcycle used by the witnesses as the same 
was not available at the place of occurrence.” (emphasis supplied)  
The said motorcycle, which was allegedly used by the prosecution witnesses 
namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)   to arrive at the 
place of occurrence, was not even produced during the entire period of 
investigation nor was produced before the learned trial court. The non-production 
of the motorcycle used by the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)    
and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)  to arrive at the place of occurrence and the 
failure of Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)    and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)  to produce the 
same before the learned trial court leads to only one conclusion and that being that 
no such motorcycle was available. Had a motorcycle been used by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)  to arrive 
at the place of occurrence, then the same must have been available at the place of 
occurrence, at the time of arrival of Imran Arif ,Inspector (PW-16), the 
Investigating Officer of the case then the same would necessarily have been taken 
into possession by Imran Arif ,Inspector (PW-16), the Investigating Officer of the 
case but it was not even seen by him and it proves that a false claim was made by 
the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2)  that they had arrived at the place of occurrence on a motorcycle. In this 
manner, the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Rizwan (PW-2) failed miserably to prove that they had indeed arrived at the place 
of occurrence, at the time when the same was happening. Reliance in this regard is 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
18 
 
placed on the case of “Muhammad Ali Vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 137) wherein 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:- 
“The Investigating Officer during the cross-examination has admitted that the 
'Dala' was not present when he visited the spot and he had not taken into 
possession the said 'Dala' during investigation. So the story introduced by the 
eye-witnesses that they were travelling on the 'Dala' when the incident took place 
is not supported by any connecting material.” 
In this manner, both the eye witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) failed miserably to establish the reason for their 
presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence and the mode 
through which they arrived at the place of occurrence. The prosecution was under a 
bounden duty to establish not only that the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul 
Razzaq (PW-1)    and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)    had a reason to proceed to the 
place of occurrence but also to prove the mode through which the prosecution 
witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)  arrived 
at the place of occurrence. The failure of the prosecution to prove the said fact has 
vitiated our trust in Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2)   as 
being truthful witnesses. In this respect, reliance is placed on the case of 
“Muhammad Rafiq v. State” (2014 SCMR 1698) wherein the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan rejected the claim of witnesses who lived one kilometre away 
from the place of occurrence, but on the day of occurrence stated to be present near 
the spot as they were working as labourers, inasmuch as they failed to give any 
detail of the projects they were working on. Reliance is also placed on the case of 
“Usman alias Kaloo v. State” (2017 SCMR 622) wherein the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan held that the ocular account of the incident had been furnished 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
19 
 
by Zahoor Ahmad, Ghulam Farid and Manzoor Ahmed in the said case who were 
all residents of some other houses and they were not the inmates of the house 
wherein the occurrence had taken place and therefore the said eye-witnesses were, 
thus, declared as chance witnesses and not worthy of reliance. Reliance is also 
placed on the case of “Nasrullah alias Nasro v. The State” (2017 SCMR 724). 
16. 
     We have also noted that according to the prosecution witnesses namely 
Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) ,the fact that  Ch. 
Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad Ibrahim (deceased) used to help the 
complainant party of the case F.I.R No.324 of 2014 registered at Police Station 
Badhla Sant District Multan with regard to the Qatl-i-Amd of  Afzal Mahmood 
alias Kala, the brother of  Saif ur Rehman (given up prosecution witness) and as 
the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed was an accused in the said case, therefore, the 
incident took place. During the course of the trial, the fact which was admitted by 
both the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad 
Rizwan (PW-2) was that neither Ch. Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad 
Ibrahim (deceased) was related to Afzal Mahmood alias Kala (deceased), the 
brother of  Saif ur Rehman (given up prosecution witness) nor Ch. Muhammad 
Asghar son of Muhammad Ibrahim (deceased) was a witness in the case F.I.R 
No.324 of 2014 registered at Police Station Badhla Sant District Multan with 
regard to the Qatl-i-Amd of  Afzal Mahmood alias Kala, the brother of  Saif ur 
Rehman (given up prosecution witness). More importantly it was also admitted by 
the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2) that the other deceased namely Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad 
Aslam also had no  relationship with Afzal Mahmood alias Kala (deceased), the

brother of  Saif ur Rehman (given up prosecution witness) . The prosecution 
witness namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) during cross-examination, stated as under:- 
“ It is correct that Afzal was murdered and Fazal Mehmood his brother was the 
complainant of said murder case. Fazal Mehmood is yet alive. No murderous 
assault has been made against him. Saif ur Rehman Pw of the present case was 
also eye witness of said case of Muhammad Afzal. Saif ur Rehman is brother 
of said Fazal Mehmood. Asghar S/o Ibrahim was also the witness of said Afzal's 
murder case. It is correct that said Saif ur Rehman pw was present at the spot 
with me in the occurrence of present case and it is also correct that he was 
not assaulted though he was present at the place of occurrence. Muhammad 
Asghar S/o Aslam deceased of present case was not relative of said deceased 
Muhammad Afzal volunteered that they had friendship. I do not know 
whether Asghar S/o Aslam deceased of this case remained ever co-accused with 
Afzal in any case. Asghar S/o Ibrahim had no concern with the said case of 
Afzal, He was neither complaint nor accused of the said case. 
……………. 
It is correct that said Saif Ur Rehman is also pw in the present case. It is correct 
that Saif ur Rehman is also witness of FIR NO. 324- 14 and his brother is 
complainant of the said case. The deceased Asghar s/o Aslam had no blood 
relations with said Saif Ur Rehman, volunteered that they had relationship of 
friendship. Fazul Mahmood, brother of Saif Ur Rehman was the complainant of 
the said FIR NO. 324-14.” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2), during cross-
examination , stated as under:- 
“It is correct that in case FIR 324-14 dated 13.11.2014 u/s 302, 34 PPC, P.S 
Budhla Santt Multan, brother of Saif Ur Rehman, (Pw) Afzal Mahmood was

21 
 
murdered. It is correct that Fazal Mahmood, brother of Saif Ur Rehman is 
complainant of the said case. It is correct Saif Ur Rehman is also the witness of 
the said case. ”(emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2) also admitted during cross-examination that it was Saif ur Rehman (given 
up prosecution witness) who had got another case F.I.R No. 375 of 2014 registered 
against the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed and  others.  The prosecution witness 
namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) , during cross-examination stated as under:- 
“It is correct that on the statement of Saif Ur Rehman, Pw case FIR NO. 375-
14 dated 14.12.2014 u/s 324, 148, 149, 7-ATA PS Budhla Sntt was registered 
against shabbier s/o Hassan khan, Muhammad Ashfaq s/o Shabbier, Mudassar 
alias s/o Munir Ahmad, Muhammad Iqbal s/o Munir Ahmad, Muhammad Shafiq 
s/o shabbier khan, Muhammad Nadeem, Muhammad Riaz and Muhammad Ijaz 
s/o Nazar Hussain in which allegation was that above said accused person made 
straight firing upon Muhammad Asghar s/o Muhammad Aslam, deceased. It is 
correct that nobody was injured in the above said case. It is correct that above said 
case Ijaz, accused and his brother Riaz were not arrested ” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2), during cross-
examination stated as under:- 
“ It is correct that Saif Ur Rehman had got lodged a case FIR No. 375-14 at 
P.S Budhla Santt against Muhammad Shabbir s/o Hassan, Ashfaq s/o Bashir 
Khan, Mudassar alias Moni , Muhammad Iqbal alias Mona, Muhammad Shoaib, 
Nadeem, Riaz, Muhammad Ijaz, accused and his brother Muhammad 
Raiz”(emphasis supplied).

 It was   always the case of the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-
1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) that out of the three witnesses present at the 
place of  occurrence, it was only Saif ur Rehman (given up prosecution witness) 
with whom the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed had enmity .  According to the 
prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2) the motorcycle under the use of the deceased was also that of Saif ur 
Rehman (given up prosecution witness). The prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) stated during cross-examination as under :- 
“The said motor bike in use of deceased/victim was in the name of Afzal who is 
the brother of Saif ur Rehman/Pw, it was not registered in the name of any one of 
the deceased persons. The said motor cycle remained was use of Saif ur 
Rehman. It is correct that Saif ur Rehman was not sitting on the said bike at the 
time of occurrence as he was sitting on my motor cycle at the time of occurrence. 
On my motor cycle we were three persons including Saif ur Rehman while on 
other motor bike in use of the deceased/ victims was not being driven by Saif 
ur Rehman himself.” (emphasis supplied)  
In these circumstances, the prosecution witness namely Saif ur Rehman (given up 
prosecution witness) should have been the prime target of the assailants. 
Furthermore, according to the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  
and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2), the prosecution witness namely Saif ur Rehman 
(given up prosecution witness) was in clear view, at a meagre distance, from the 
assailants and unarmed whereas the accused were allegedly armed with various 
firearm and other weapons. Neither there was any dearth of ammunition nor that of 
intent and opportunity on the part of the appellant or his co-accused for not doing 
away with the prosecution witness namely Saif ur Rehman (given up prosecution 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019

witness), who, according to the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely 
Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) , was the main and the 
only adversary of the accused and who, at the time of occurrence,  was present at 
the place of occurrence and there did not exist any obstacle in the line of the sight 
of the accused and the place where the prosecution witness namely Saif ur Rehman 
(given up prosecution witness) was present. In this situation, it is hard to believe 
that the prosecution witness namely Saif ur Rehman (given up prosecution witness) 
would have been shown the courtesy of being not fired at all when Saif ur Rehman 
(given up prosecution witness) should have been the prime target of the assailants. 
In the midst of the firing by the accused persons, the prosecution witness namely 
Saif ur Rehman (given up prosecution witness) did not receive even a single 
scratch on his body during the whole occurrence nor was even targeted at all. The 
prosecution witness namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) admitted during cross-
examination as under:- 
“After distance of 400/500 feet of receiving the fire by Muhammad Asghar S/o 
Aslam the accused persons reached near us and then, due to that distance accused 
persons made constant firing and on reaching near us Iqbal alias Munna made 
fire shot on Asghar S/o Ibrahim, which landed on his right arm. He also fell down 
on receiving fire shot. Accused did not make any firing upon us. 
…………. 
The accused had not made any firing on Saif ur rehman who was also 
present there despite of the fact that he was the witness of previous 
occurrence which was the grudge of the present occurrence.  
….

When my brother left the spot of first place of occurrence to save his life and 4 
accused persons started chasing on their bikes we also went behind those 
accused persons. We were about 15/20 feet behind the bikes of said accused.”. 
(emphasis supplied)   
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) admitted during 
cross-examination as under:- 
“ When accused persons made lalkara we were at the distance of about 15 feet 
from both the deceased persons” 
If the prosecution witness namely Saif ur Rehman (given up prosecution witness) 
had been present in the view of the assailants, then he would not have been spared. 
Blessing the prosecution witness namely Saif ur Rehman (given up prosecution 
witness) with such incredible consideration and showing him such favour, the only 
person with whom the assailants had a direct dispute with, is implausible and 
opposed to the natural behaviour of any accused. It is all the more illogical that 
being perceptive of the fact that if the witnesses were left alive, they would depose 
against the accused, even then the appellant and his co-accused did not cause any 
injury to them. Such behaviour, on the part of the accused as deposed by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2) runs counter to natural human conduct and behaviour. Article 129 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 allows the courts to presume the existence of any 
fact, which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common 
course of natural events and human conduct in relation to the facts of the particular 
case. We thus trust the existence of this fact, by virtue of the Article 129 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, that the conduct of the assailants, as deposed to by 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
25 
 
the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2)  was opposed to the common course of natural events and human conduct. 
Hence, we are holding that the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-
1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) did not witness the occurrence. The august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgments has repeatedly held that in a 
scenario where the motivation was against the complainant or the witnesses but the 
accused did not cause any harm to them, notwithstanding being within the range of 
their firing, would reveal that the said witnesses had not witnessed the occurrence. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case Tariq Mehmood v. The State and 
others (2019 SCMR 1170) has observed as under: 
“First sight cannot escape preponderance of evidence, however on a closer view, 
emerges a picture incompatible with the events, narrated in the crime report. The 
accused mounted assault, as per prosecution's own case to settle score with 
Muhammad Usman, PW for his alleged affair with the lady related to the 
appellant; it is disgrace that brought the assailants, face to face, with Muhammad 
Usman, PW, well within their view and reach it is astonishing that while being 
merciless without restraint upon others they spared prime target of assault. There 
can be no other inference that either Muhammad Usman was not present at the 
scene or the occurrence took place in a backdrop other than asserted in the crime 
report.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case Rohtas Khan v. The State (2010 
SCMR 566) at page 571 observed as under: 
“The alleged motive was against the complainant, but it is noted that the 
appellant did not cause any injury to the complainant, though he was present 
within the range of firing, thus it supports the contention of the learned counsel of 
appellant that P.Ws. were not present at the place of occurrence.”  
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Farooq & 
another v. The State (2006 SCMR 1707) at page 1712 held as under:- 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
26 
 
“Had P.W.9 been present on the spot, he was not likely to be spared because the 
number of injuries on the person of deceased show that at least eighteen rounds 
were fired. It only shows the degree of venom the killer had for the deceased.” 
We are also guided by the binding judgment of the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan passed in the case of Mst. Rukhsana Begum & others v. Sajjad & others 
(2017 SCMR 596) where at page 601 it was observed as under:- 
“Another intriguing aspect of the matter is that, according to the F.I.R., all the 
accused encircled the complainant, the PWs and the two deceased thus, the 
apparent object was that none could escape alive. The complainant being father 
of the two deceased and the head of the family was supposed to be the prime 
target. In fact he has vigorously pursued the case against the accused and also 
deposed against them as an eye witness. The site plan positions would show that, 
he and the other P.W.s were at the mercy of the assailants but being the prime 
target even no threat was extended to him. Blessing him with unbelievable 
courtesy and mercy shown to him by the accused knowing well that he and the 
witnesses would depose against them by leaving them unhurt, is absolutely 
unbelievable story. Such behavior, on the part of the accused runs counter to 
natural human conduct and behavior explained in the provision of Article 129 of 
the Qanun-e-Shahadat, Order 1984, therefore, the court is unable to accept such 
unbelievable proposition.” 
 
17.        We have also noted that according to the prosecution witnesses namely 
Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)    and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2), the place of occurrence 
was situated in a thickly populated area and was surrounded by many shops. The 
prosecution witness namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) during his statement recorded 
by the learned trial court  stated as under:- 
“So many people were present there due to fear of firing no one came 
near to us. They could be 15. 20 or 40 persons. 
…………… 
Only my son is my witness of this case. 
………. 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
27 
 
It is correct that at the place of occurrence, there is a Chowk and so many 
people remained present at there and there were many shops. 
…… 
It is correct that there are 70/80 shops existing around the place of 
occurrence.  ” (emphasis supplied)  
We have also noted that according to the rough site plan of the place of occurrence 
(Exh. PP) as prepared by Imran Arif, Inspector (PW-16)  , the Investigating Officer 
of the case,  and the scaled site plan of the place of occurrence (Exh.PN) as 
prepared by Irfan Hayat, draftsman (PW-13)  near  and around the place of 
occurrence , there were many shops. None of those who had their shops around the 
place of occurrence joined the investigation of the case and also did not appear 
before the learned trial court to support the prosecution case. The prosecution was 
under a bounden duty to produce the witnesses who were the residents of the place 
of occurrence. Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 provides that if any 
evidence available with the parties is not produced then it shall be presumed that 
had that evidence been produced the same would have been gone against the party 
producing the same. Illustration (g) of the said Article 129 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 reads as under: - 
“(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would, if 
produced, be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.” 
The purpose of the trial is the discovery of truth. As long as men keep lying the 
only causality would be the reality. The prosecution case suffers from inherent 
defects which are irreconcilable as it is. The guidance is sought from the binding 
decisions of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled “Nadeem alias 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
28 
 
Nanha alias Billa Sher Vs. The State” (2010 SCMR 949) wherein it has been 
observed as under: - 
“…. further that no independent witness of the locality where the incident 
took place, a ‘Bazar’ joined, made case of the prosecution doubtful. It is 
cardinal principle of Criminal Jurisprudence that any genuine doubt 
arising out of the circumstances of the case should be extended to the 
accused as of the right and not as concession. It is difficult to say that 
prosecution has proved its case beyond shadow of doubt.”  
 
18. 
We have also noted that both the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul 
Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) had stated that the accused  were 
standing in front of a godown of wheat when they attacked the deceased. The 
prosecution witness namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1), in his statement before the 
learned trial court, stated as under:- 
“Stated that on 20.03.2015, 1 alongwith my sons Saif ur Rehman, Muhammad 
rizwan, while riding on motor cycle, My brother Muhammad Asghar S/o 
Muhammad Ibrahim, Muhammad Asghar S/o Muhammad Aslam, riding on other 
motor cycle bearing registration No.MNP-2919 going ahead of us were returning 
after saying Jumma Prayer, when we reached near godown of wheat, where 08 
persons were already standing they were Muhammad Khan, Shabbir, Iqbal, Faraz, 
Mudassar, Azeem, Ijaz and Mujahid S/o Shabbir, accused persons, all present in 
the court. Shabbir and Muhammad Khan raised lalkara that the complainant party 
should not go from there safely. ” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2), in his statement 
before the learned trial court , stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
29 
 
“ It was about 01:45 pm as we reached near the godown of wheat, where 
accused Muhammad Khan S/o Faiz Muhammad, Muhammad Shabbir S/o 
Hassan Khan were already present……..”(emphasis supplied)  
Despite this claim of the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and 
Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) that the deceased were attacked when they were in 
front of a warehouse  of storing  wheat , it was admitted by the prosecution 
witnesses that the said warehouse  was not shown in either the rough site plan of 
the place of occurrence (Exh. PP) as prepared by Imran Arif, Inspector (PW-16), 
the Investigating Officer of the case or in the scaled site plan of the place of 
occurrence (Exh.PN) as prepared by Irfan Hayat, draftsman (PW-13). The 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) during cross-examination 
was confronted in this regard and the learned trial court observed as under:- 
“The draftsman prepared the sketch of the crime scene according to my 
pointation. I had also informed about the Galla Godam. I have seen the sketch of 
the crime scene where Galla Godam was pointed out, (the sketch after crime 
scene is present in the police file wherein Galla Godam is not pointed out).” 
(emphasis supplied) 
Similarly, Imran Arif, Inspector (PW-16) , the Investigating Officer of the case 
also admitted during cross-examination as under:- 
“ It is mentioned in the FIR that occurrence took place near Ghala Godown, 
however this fact is not mentioned in Ex-PP. I summoned draftsman on 
25.03.2015. I recorded his statement under Sec. 161 Cr.P.C. on 29.03.2015. It is 
correct that draftsman had also not shown "Ghala Godown" in scaled site 
plans.” (emphasis supplied)

In this manner, it was proved that the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq 
(PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) could not even give the description of the 
place of occurrence with any degree of certainty exposing their absence at the time 
of occurrence.  
19. 
We have also noted that according to the prosecution witnesses namely 
Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) , the deceased namely 
Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad Aslam had been fired at when he was 
riding the motorcycle, which motorcycle was being driven by the other deceased 
namely Ch. Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad Ibrahim and  after being hit by 
the bullets, Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad Aslam (deceased) fell from the 
motorcycle on the road, whereas the other deceased namely Ch. Muhammad 
Asghar son of Muhammad Ibrahim kept on driving the motorcycle to as far as a 
distance of about 487 feet. The prosecution witness namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) 
, during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“Both the fire shots made by the accused persons hit from the back side of the 
deceased Asghar s/o Muhammad Aslam. The deceased Muhammad Asghar s/o 
Aslam fell on the side of metaled Road. Deceased Muhammad Asghar s/o 
Aslam might receive injuries by falling on the ground ” (emphasis supplied)  
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2), during cross-
examination, stated as under:- 
“First fire was hit to Asghar S/o Aslam who fell down on the ground ” 
Had the occurrence taken place in the manner as described by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) , then , 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019

as stated by the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and 
Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2), the deceased namely Muhammad Asghar son of 
Muhammad Aslam must have suffered injuries due to his fall from the moving 
motorcycle, however, Dr. Liaquat Ali Ansari (PW-6) who conducted the post 
mortem examination of the dead body of  Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad 
Aslam (deceased) did not observe any injuries present on  his dead body which had 
been caused due to the fall of Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad Aslam 
(deceased) from the motorcycle. Dr. Liaquat Ali Ansari (PW-6) opined that all the 
nine injuries observed by him to be present on the dead body of  Muhammad 
Asghar son of Muhammad Aslam (deceased) had been caused by the use of a 
firearm weapon. In this manner, the narrative of the incident as given by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2) does not conform with the opinion and observations of Dr. Liaquat Ali 
Ansari (PW-6), denuding the flaw in the statements of prosecution witnesses 
namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2). 
20. 
We have also noted that both the  prosecution witnesses namely Abdul 
Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) were  not mentioned either in  
column No.4 of the inquest report (Exh.PQ) as being the witnesses who had 
identified the dead body of the deceased namely Muhammad Asghar son of 
Muhammad Aslam at the time of preparation of the inquest report (Exh.PQ)  nor 
were mentioned at page 4 of the inquest report (Exh.PQ) as witnesses who were 
present at the place of occurrence at the time of preparation of the inquest report 
(Exh.PQ). The presence of Muhammad Aslam and Muhammad Akram has been 
mentioned  in  column No.4 of the inquest report (Exh.PQ) and the presence of 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
32 
 
Muhammad Yousaf and Muhammad Sarfraz has been mentioned at page 4 of the 
inquest report (Exh.PQ) as witnesses who were present at the place of occurrence 
at the time of preparation of the inquest report (Exh.PQ). We have also noted that 
both the  prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad 
Rizwan (PW-2) were also  not mentioned either in  column No.4 of the inquest 
report (Exh.PR) as being the witnesses who had identified the dead body of the 
deceased namely Ch. Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad Ibrahim at the time 
of preparation of the inquest report (Exh.PR)  nor were mentioned at page 4 of the 
inquest report (Exh.PR) as witnesses who were present at the place of occurrence 
at the time of preparation of the inquest report (Exh.PR). The presence of 
Muhammad Farhan and Asim Razzaq has been mentioned in  column No.4 of the 
inquest report (Exh.PR) and the presence of Tanzeem Akram and Muhammad 
Akram has been mentioned at page 4 of the inquest report (Exh.PR) as witnesses 
who were present at the place of occurrence at the time of preparation of the 
inquest report (Exh.PR). This fact also point towards the absence of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2)  at the place of occurrence, at the time of preparation of both the inquest 
reports (Exh.PQ and Exh.PR) by Imran Arif, Inspector (PW-16), the Investigating 
Officer of the case. 
21. 
The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsels for the 
complainant placed much emphasis on the promptitude with which the written 
application (Exh.PA)  of Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) was presented for the registration 
of the formal F.I.R (Exh.PA/1)  and stated that this excluded the possibility of any 
pre-concert prior to the writing and submission of the written application  (Exh. 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
33 
 
PA). A perusal of the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul 
Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) reveals that they made 
contradictory statements with regard to the writing and the submission of written 
application (Exh.PA). According to the prosecution witness namely Abdul Razzaq 
(PW-1) he himself never even submitted the written application (Exh.PA) at the 
Police Station rather the said written application (Exh.PA) was taken to the Police 
Station by his nephew  namely Muhammad Shahid who himself was a police 
officer. The prosecution witness namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) during cross-
examination, stated as under:- 
“ The FIR was chalked on my written application. The said application Ex P. A 
was drafted by nephew who is a police servant and I had signed the said 
application and that was sent to the police Station through my said Nephew 
Muhammad Shahid S/o Rabnawaz. 
………….. 
I had remained at the spot and written the application Ex.P. and handed 
over it to my nephew Shahid. He took the application to the police.”  
(emphasis supplied)  
Contradicting the statement of Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) that he had sent the written 
application (Exh.PA) to the Police Station through his nephew namely Muhammad 
Shahid, the prosecution witness namely Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) stated that 
Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  had submitted the written application (Exh.PA) at the 
Police Station himself . Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) during cross-examination, 
stated as under:- 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
34 
 
“My father had also submitted application in the PS. After shifting of 
deadbodies to hospital, my father went to PS for submitting application. That 
application was written by my father which was submitted in the Police Station. 
My father after submitting the application to the PS, came behind us to the 
Nishtar Hospital, Multan. ” (emphasis supplied)  
The above referred reply of Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) that the written 
application (Exh.PA) was submitted to the Police Station after the shifting of the 
dead bodies to the hospital also proves that the said written application (Exh.PA) 
was submitted after the Investigating Officer of the case  had already visited the 
place of occurrence and had also conducted a detailed inquiry. It is also a fact that 
according to the prosecution witness namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) he had named 
as many as eight accused in his written application (Exh.PA) , however, all the said 
accused persons were found to had been falsely involved by him during the course 
of investigation. The prosecution witness namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) admitted 
during cross-examination , as under:- 
“I had nominated 8 accused persons in my present FIR. It is correct that all the 
said accused persons were declared innocent. volunteered that I am not having 
any agreement with the police party. Mahr Bashir Ahmad SI remained 
investigator in my case. It is correct that he declared all the nominated 
accused persons as innocent and incorporated another set of the accused 
persons as culprits ” (emphasis supplied)  
 The scrutiny of the statements of the prosecution witnesses reveals that the written 
application  (Exh. P.A.) as submitted by Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  was neither 
prompt nor spontaneous nor natural, rather was a contrived, manufactured and a 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
35 
 
compromised document. No corroboration of the prosecution evidence can be had 
from the written application  (Exh. PA) as submitted by Abdul Razzaq (PW-1). 
22. 
  We have also noted with disquiet that the postmortem examinations of the 
dead bodies of the deceased were conducted with much delay. According to the 
statement of  Dr. Liaquat Ali Ansari (PW-6)  , the post mortem examination of the 
dead body  of the deceased namely Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad Aslam 
was conducted by him on 20.03.2015 at 09.45 p.m, whereas the post mortem 
examination of the dead body  of the deceased namely Ch.Muhammad Asghar son 
of Muhammad Ibrahim was conducted by him on 20.03.2015 at 08.30 p.m . 
Furthermore, according to the Post Mortem Examination Reports (Exh.PC and 
Exh.PE) as well as the statement of Dr. Liaquat Ali Ansari (PW-6) , the police 
papers were received at 08.00 p.m on 20.03.2015 and thereafter the post mortem 
examinations of the dead bodies of the deceased were conducted. Dr. Liaquat Ali 
Ansari (PW-6) Further explained during cross-examination as under:- 
“ I have given the probable time between death and PM examination of 
Muhammad Asghar S/O Ibrahim as 6 hours which may be counted as probable 
time as death at 2:30 p.m. 
I conducted PM examination on the dead body of Muhammad Asghar S/O 
Muhammad Aslam at 9:45 p.m. I mentioned probable time between death and 
PM examination at 8 to 9 hours which may be counted for the purpose of 
probable time of death as 1:00 to 2:00p.m.” (emphasis supplied)  
The perusal of the Post Mortem Examination Reports (Exh.PC and Exh.PE) as 
well as the statement of   Dr. Liaquat Ali Ansari (PW-6)  clearly establishes the 
fact the post mortem examinations of the dead bodies of the deceased were delayed 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
36 
 
and the delay was due to the late submission of police papers. No explanation was 
offered to justify the said delay in conducting the post mortem examinations. This 
clearly establishes that the witnesses claiming to have seen the occurrence were not 
present at the time of occurrence and the delay in the post mortem examinations 
was used to procure their attendance and formulate a false narrative after 
consultation and concert. It has been repeatedly held by the august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan that such delay in the post mortem examination is reflective of the 
absence of witnesses and the sole purpose of causing such delay is to procure the 
presence of witnesses and to further advance a false narrative to involve any 
person. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Khalid alias Khalidi 
and two others vs. The State” (2012 SCMR 327) has held as under: 
“The incident in the instant case took place at 2.00 a.m, FIR was recorded at 4/5 
a.m, Doctor Muhammad Pervaiz medically examined the injured person at 4.00 
a.m. but conducted the post mortem examination of the deceased at 3.00 p.m i.e. 
after about ten hours, which fact clearly shows that the FIR was not lodged at the 
given time”. 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Mian SOHAIL AHMED and 
others vs. The State and others” (2019 SCMR 956) has held as under: 
“According to the Doctor (PW-10), who did the post-mortem examination, the 
dead-body of the deceased was brought to the mortuary at 11:15 a.m. on 
01.9.2006 and the post-mortem examination took place at 12 noon after a delay of 
15 hours. This delay in the post-mortem examination, when the occurrence was 
promptly reported at 8:45 p.m. and formal FIR was registered at 9.00 p.m. on 
31.8.2006 gives rise to an inference that the incident was not reported as stated 
by the prosecution” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “MUHAMMAD RAFIQUE 
alias FEEQA vs. The State” (2019 SCMR 1068) has held as under: 
“More importantly, the only person who can medically examine the dead body 
during the said police custody of the dead body is the medical officer, and that 
too, when the same is handed over to him by the police for its examination. For 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
37 
 
the purposes of the present case, it is crucial to note that, at the time of handing 
over a dead body by the police to the medical officer, all reports prepared by the 
investigating officer are also to be handed over in order to assist in the 
examination of the dead body. 
10. 
Thus, once there is suspicion regarding the death of a person, the 
following essential steps follow: firstly, there is a complete chain of police 
custody of the dead body, right from the moment it is taken into custody until it is 
handed over to the relatives, or in case they are unknown, then till his burial; 
secondly, post mortem examination of a dead person cannot be carried out 
without the authorization of competent police officer or the magistrate; thirdly, 
post mortem of a deceased person can only be carried out by a notified 
government Medical Officer; and finally, at the time of handing over the dead 
body by the police to the Medical Officer, all reports prepared by the 
investigating officer are also to be handed over to the said medical officer to 
assist his examination of the dead body. 
11. 
It is usually the delay in the preparation of these police reports, which 
are required to be handed over to the medical officer along with the dead body, 
that result in the consequential delay of the post mortem examination of the 
dead person. To repel any adverse inference for such a delay, the prosecution has 
to provide justifiable reasons therefor, which in the present case is strikingly 
wanting.”  
 
23. 
 The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant, have submitted that the recovery of the Kalashnikov rifle (P-11)  
from the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed son of Nazar Hussain and the report of the 
Punjab Forensic Science Agency,Lahore (Exh.PX) offered sufficient corroboration 
of the statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and 
Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) . Regarding the recovery of the Kalashnikov rifle (P-
11) from the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed son of Nazar Hussain it is observed 
that the said recovery was made on 12.08.2015 at the time of arrest of the appellant 
namely Ejaz Ahmed during the investigation of the case F.I.R No.556 of 2015 
registered at Police Station New Multan District Multan and the said Kalashnikov 
rifle (P-11)  was obtained by Bashir Ahmad, SI (PW-15) from the Malkhana of 
Police Station New Multan District Multan on 11.09.2015 and was handed over to 
Riaz Ali 1774/HC (PW-4) for keeping it in safe custody.  It was also stated by 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
38 
 
Bashir Ahmad SI (PW-15), the Investigating Officer of the case , that he formally 
arrested the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed in the present case on 31.08.2015. The 
prosecution has not produced any witness in whose custody the said Kalashnikov 
rifle (P-11)  remained from the date of its recovery on 12.08.2015  till its handing 
over to Bashir Ahmad, SI (PW-15) on 11.09.2015. Therefore, it is proved on 
record that the safe custody and safe transmission of the recovered Kalashnikov 
rifle (P-11) from the place of its recovery to the police station New Multan , 
District Multan was not proved and the possibility of manipulating the said 
recovered Kalashnikov rifle (P-11) to procure a favourable report of the Punjab 
Forensic Science Agency, Lahore  is obvious. Consequently, the recovery of the 
Kalashnikov rifle (P-11) from the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed could not be 
proved and cannot be considered as a relevant fact for proving any fact in issue.It 
is an admitted rule of appreciation of evidence that recovery is only a supporting 
piece of evidence and if the ocular account is found to be unreliable, then the 
recovery has no evidentiary value. 
 
24.       The Learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for the 
complainant have also relied upon the evidence of motive and submitted that it 
corroborated the ocular account. The motive of the occurrence as stated by 
prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1) and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2) was that  Ch. Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad Ibrahim (deceased) 
used to help the complainant party of the case F.I.R No.324 of 2014 registered at 
Police Station Badhla Sant District Multan with regard to the Qatl-i-Amd of  Afzal 
Mahmood alias Kala, the brother of  Saif ur Rehman (given up prosecution 
witness) and as the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed was an accused in the said case, 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
39 
 
therefore, the occurrence took place. Throughout the course of the trial, the fact 
which was admitted by both the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-
1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) was that neither Ch. Muhammad Asghar son 
of Muhammad Ibrahim (deceased) was related to Afzal Mahmood alias Kala 
(deceased), the brother of  Saif ur Rehman (given up prosecution witness) nor Ch. 
Muhammad Asghar son of Muhammad Ibrahim (deceased) was a witness in the 
case F.I.R No.324 of 2014 registered at Police Station Badhla Sant District Multan 
with regard to the Qatl-i-Amd of  Afzal Mahmood alias Kala, the brother of  Saif ur 
Rehman (given up prosecution witness). More significantly, it was also admitted 
by the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad 
Rizwan (PW-2) that the other deceased namely Muhammad Asghar son of 
Muhammad Aslam also had no relationship with Afzal Mahmood alias Kala 
(deceased), the brother of  Saif ur Rehman (given up prosecution witness). As has 
been already discussed by us, had the motive of occurrence been as was stated by 
the prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan 
(PW-2)  then the prosecution witnesses namely Saif ur Rehman (given up 
prosecution witness)  would have been the prime target, however, he was not 
targeted at all, clearly proving the fact that the motive as stated by the prosecution 
witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) was not 
the motivation of the assailants. The prosecution witnesses failed to provide 
evidence enabling us to determine the truthfulness of the motive alleged. The 
prosecution witnesses failed to prove the fact that the said motive was so 
compelling that it could have led the appellant to have committed the Qatl-i-Amd 
of the deceased. There is a haunting silence with regard to the minutiae of the 
motive alleged. No independent witness was produced by the prosecution to prove 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
40 
 
the motive as alleged.  Moreover, it is an admitted rule of appreciation of evidence 
that motive is only a corroborative piece of evidence and if the ocular account is 
found to be unreliable then motive alone cannot be made basis of conviction. Even 
otherwise a tainted piece of evidence cannot corroborate another tainted piece of 
evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of 
Muhammad Javed v. The State (2016 SCMR 2021) as under: 
“The said related and chance witnesses had failed to receive any 
independent corroboration inasmuch as no independent proof of the 
motive set up by the prosecution had been brought on the record of the 
case.” 
 Furthermore, it is settled law that motive is a double-edge weapon, which can 
cut either way; if it was the reason for the appellant to murder the deceased, it 
equally was a ground for the complainant to falsely implicate them in this case. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of Muhammad Ashraf 
Alias Acchu v. The State (2019 S C M R 652) as under:- 
“7.         The motive is always a double-edged weapon. The 
complainant Sultan Ahmad (PW9) has admitted murder enmity 
between the parties and has also given details of the same in his 
statement recorded before the trial court. No doubt, previous enmity 
can be a reason for the appellant to commit the alleged crime, but it 
can equally be a reason for the complainant side to falsely implicate 
the appellant in this case for previous grouse.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Liaqat Ali and 11 others v. The State” 
(1992 S C M R 372) wherein it has been held as under:- 
“In this behalf, it may be observed that the motive is a double-edged 
weapon which could be one of the reasons for false implication as well 
as has been held by the Supreme Court in the case of Allah Bakhsh and 
another v. The State (PLD 1978 SC 171).”

25. 
     The learned Additional Prosecutor General and the learned counsel for 
the complainant have also laid much premium on the abscondence of the appellant 
namely Ejaz Ahmed son of Nazar Hussain  as proof of his guilt. The fact of 
abscondence of an accused can be used as a corroborative piece of evidence, which 
cannot be read in isolation but it has to be read along with the substantive piece of 
evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of Asadullah 
v. Muhammad Ali (PLD 1971 SC 541) that both corroborative and ocular evidence 
are to be read together and not in isolation. As regards abscondence, the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of  Rasool Muhammad v. Asal 
Muhammad (1995 SCMR 1373) that abscondence is only a suspicious 
circumstance. In the case of Muhammad Sadiq v. Najeeb Ali (1995 SCMR 1632) 
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed that abscondence itself has no 
value in the absence of any other evidence. It was also held in the case of 
Muhammad Khan v. State (1999 SCMR 1220) that abscondence of the accused 
can never remedy the defects in the prosecution case. In the case of Gul Khan v. 
State (1999 SCMR 304) it was observed by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
that abscondence per se is not sufficient to prove the guilt but can be taken as a 
corroborative piece of evidence. In the cases of Muhammad Arshad v. Qasim Ali 
(1992 SCMR 814), Pir Badshah v. State (1985 SCMR 2070) and Amir Gul v. 
State (1981 SCMR 182) it was observed that conviction on abscondence alone 
cannot be sustained. In the present case, a substantive piece of evidence in the 
shape of ocular account has been disbelieved, therefore, no conviction can be 
based on abscondence alone. Reliance is also placed on the cases of “Muhammad 
Farooq and another Vs. The State” (2006 SCMR 1707) and “Nizam Khan and 2 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
42 
 
others Vs. the State” (1984 SCMR 1092) and Rohtas Khan vs. The State (2010 
SCMR 566). 
26.         The only other piece of evidence left to be considered by us is the medical 
evidence with regard to the injuries observed on the dead bodies of the deceased by 
Dr. Liaquat Ali Ansari (PW-6)   but the same is of no assistance in this case as 
medical evidence by its nature and character, cannot recognize a culprit in case of 
an unobserved incidence. As all the other pieces of evidence relied upon by the 
prosecution in this case have been disbelieved and discarded by this Court, 
therefore, the appellant’s conviction cannot be upheld on the basis of medical 
evidence alone. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment 
titled “Hashim Qasim and another Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 986) has 
enunciated the following principle of law:  
“The medical evidence is only confirmatory or of supporting nature 
and is never held to be corroboratory evidence, to identify the 
culprit.”   
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its binding judgment titled “Naveed 
Asghar and two others Vs. The State” (P L D 2021 Supreme Court 600) has 
enunciated the following principle of law:  
“31. 
The prosecution has attempted to complete the chain of circumstantial 
evidence by medical evidence relating to the post mortem examinations of the 
deceased persons. This evidence proves only the factum that death of the 
deceased persons was caused by cutting their throats through some sharp edge 
weapon; it does in no way indicate who had cut their throats and with what 
particular weapon. Medical evidence is in the nature of supporting, 
confirmatory or explanatory of the direct or circumstantial evidence, and is 
not "corroborative evidence" in the sense the term is used in legal parlance for 
a piece of evidence that itself also has some probative force to connect the 
accused person with the commission of offence. Medical evidence by itself 
does not throw any light on the identity of the offender. Such evidence may 
confirm the available substantive evidence with regard to certain facts 
including seat of the injury, nature of the injury, cause of the death, kind of the 
weapon used in the occurrence, duration between the injuries and the death, 
and presence of an injured witness or the injured accused at the place of 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
43 
 
occurrence, but it does not connect the accused with the commission of the 
offence. It cannot constitute corroboration for proving involvement of the 
accused person in the commission of offence, as it does not establish the 
identity of the accused person.32 Therefore, the medical evidence is of little 
help to the prosecution for bringing home the guilt to the petitioners.” 
 
27.      Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt in our 
minds regarding the involvement of the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed son of 
Nazar Hussain in the present case. It is a settled principle of law that for giving 
benefit of the doubt it is not necessary that there should be so many circumstances 
rather, if only a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in the mind of a 
prudent person is available, then the such benefit is to be extended to an accused 
not as a matter of concession but as of right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
in the case of "Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State" (2018 SCMR 772) has 
enunciated the following principle: 
"Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an accused it 
is not necessary that there should be many circumstances creating doubt. 
If there is a circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent 
mind about the guilt of the accused, then the accused would be entitled to 
the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of grace and concession, but as a 
matter of right. It is based on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty 
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted". 
Reliance in this behalf can be made upon the cases of Tariq Pervez v. The 
State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir and 2 others v. The State (2008 
SCMR 1221), Muhammad Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and 
Muhammad Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749)." 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
"Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State" (2021 S C M R 736) in which it has been held as:- 
"9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt is not a 
ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete justice. This is 
an established principle of law and equity that it is better that 100 
guilty persons should let off but one innocent person should not suffer. 
As the preeminent English jurist William Blackstone wrote, "Better that 
ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer." Benjamin 
Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of early American history,

went further arguing "it is better a hundred guilty persons should 
escape than one innocent person should suffer." All the contradictions 
noted by the learned High Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of 
doubt on the prosecution's case, which entitles the petitioner to the 
right of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that for 
the accused to be afforded this right of the benefit of the doubt it is not 
necessary that there should be many circumstances creating 
uncertainty and if there is only one doubt, the benefit of the same must 
got to the petitioner. This Court in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The 
State (PLD 2019 SC 64) while relying on the the earlier judgments of 
this Court has categorically held that "if a single circumstance creates 
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the apprehension of guilt of 
an accused, then he/she shall be entitled to such benefit not as a matter 
of grace and concession, but as of right. Reference in this regard may 
be made to the cases of Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) 
and Ayub Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048)." The same view was 
reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when this court 
observed that once a single loophole is observed in a case presented by 
the prosecution, such as conflict in the ocular account and medical 
evidence or presence of eye-witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of 
such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution's case automatically goes in 
favour of an accused."

 For what has been discussed above the Criminal Appeal No.788-J of 2019  
lodged by the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed son of Nazar Hussain is allowed and 
the conviction and sentence of the appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed son of Nazar 
Hussain awarded by the learned trial court through the impugned judgment dated 
11.02.2019 are hereby set-aside. The appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed son of Nazar 
Hussain is ordered to be acquitted by extending him the benefit of doubt. The 
appellant namely Ejaz Ahmed son of Nazar Hussain is in custody and he is 
directed to be released forthwith if not required in any other case. 
29. 
The complainant of the case namely Abdul Razzaq filed Criminal Appeal 
No.588 of 2019 against the acquittal of the accused namely Muhammad 
Khan,Shabbir Ahmad, Muhammad Iqbal, Muhammad Azeem, Mujahid Hussain, 
Mudassar and Faraz  (all since acquitted),  the co-accused of the appellant by the 
learned trial court.  We have observed that the learned trial court has rightly 

Murder Reference No.22 of 2019 
Criminal Appeal No. 788-J of 2019 
Criminal Appeal  No.588 of 2019 
45 
 
acquitted the said accused. The prosecution witnesses namely Abdul Razzaq (PW-
1)  and Muhammad Rizwan (PW-2) failed miserably to prove their reason for 
presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence and made 
contradictory statements with regard to the various details of the incident which 
have been discussed above in detail. It is also a fact of the prosecution case that the 
Investigating Officers of the case  declared all the accused namely Muhammad 
Khan ,Shabbir Ahmad, Muhammad Iqbal, Muhammad Azeem, Mujahid Hussain, 
Mudassar and Faraz as having been wrongly involved  in the case and nothing 
incriminating was recovered from the accused namely Muhammad Khan ,Shabbir 
Ahmad, Muhammad Iqbal, Muhammad Azeem, Mujahid Hussain, Mudassar and 
Faraz. It   is   important   to   note   that   according   to   established principle of the 
criminal administration of justice, once an acquittal is  recorded  in  favour  of  
accused facing  criminal  charge  he  enjoys  double presumption  of innocence, 
therefore, the courts competent to interfere in the acquittal order should be slow in 
converting the same into conviction,  unless and  until  the  said  order is  patently 
illegal, shocking, based on misreading  and  non-reading  of  the record or 
perverse.  The said principle has been enunciated by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the judgment reported as “Ghulam Sikandar and another Versus 
Mamaraz Khan and Others” (P L D 1985 Supreme Court 11) wherein it has been 
held as under: 
“The Court would not interfere with acquittal merely because on re-
appraisal of the evidence it comes to the conclusion different from that of 
the Court acquitting the accused provided both the conclusions are 
reasonably possible. If however. the conclusion reached by that Court was 
such that no reasonable person would conceivably reach the same and was 
impossible then this Court would interfere in exceptional cases on 
overwhelming proof resulting in conclusion and irresistible conclusion; and 
that too with a view only to avoid grave miscarriage of justice and for no

46 
 
other purpose. The important test visualised in these cases, in this behalf 
was that the finding sought to be interfered with, after scrutiny under the 
foregoing searching light, should be found wholly as artificial, shocking and 
ridiculous.” 
 Reliance is placed on the case of “Muhammad   Inayat   Versus   The   State” 
(1998   SCMR   1854) wherein it has been held as under: 
“The judgment of acquittal qua Muhammad Yousaf, Muhammad Saeed and 
Muhammad Nawaz cannot, in the given situation, be termed as perverse or 
foolish inasmuch as the view having been taken by the High Court can 
possibly be taken for acquitting them in the peculiar facts and circumstances 
of this case. It cannot be said that the impugned judgment of the High Court 
acquitting Muhammad Yousaf and two others is fanciful, artificial, shocking 
or ridiculous. 1t is based on convincing reasons” 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Mst. Sughran Begum and 
another Vs. Qaiser Pervaiz and others” (2015 SCMR 1142) has held as under: 
“On acquittal, an accused person earns twofold innocence particularly, in 
the case when there are concurrent findings to that effect by the trial Court 
and the Court of First Appeal (High Court), is the bedrock principle of 
justice. In a case of acquittal, the standard and principle of appreciation of 
evidence is entirely different from that in a case of conviction. Unless the 
concurrent findings of the two Courts below are found perverse, fanciful, 
arbitrary and are based on misreading and non-reading of material 
evidence causing miscarriage of justice, the Supreme Court would not 
lightly disturb the same because on reappraisal, another view might be 
possible therefore, sanctity is attached under the law to such concurrent 
findings in ordinary course.” 
 
 Pursuant to the discussion made and conclusions arrived at above, the Criminal 
Appeal No.588 of 2019, lodged by the complainant of the case namely Abdul 
Razzaq  assailing the acquittal of Muhammad Khan ,Shabbir Ahmad, Muhammad 
Iqbal, Muhammad Azeem, Mujahid Hussain, Mudassar and Faraz  by the learned 
trial court from the charges is hereby dismissed.
