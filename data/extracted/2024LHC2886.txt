MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- 
Through instant appeal, appellant has challenged judgment 
dated 07.01.2023, passed by learned Senior Civil Judge (Civil 
Division), Gujranwala, whereby Reference Application under 
Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (“the Act of 
1894”), filed by respondent No.1, was accepted and he was 
held entitled to get compensation of acquired land @ 
Rs.20,00,000/- per Acre along with 15% compulsory 
acquisition charges, compound interest @ 8% from the date of 
possession i.e. date of issuance of Notification u/s 4 of the Act

2 
RFA No.20881 of 2023 
land, which was contested by the Land Acquisition Collector 
and appellant / National Highway Authority by filing written 
replies. Out of divergent pleadings of the parties, the Referee 
Court framed following issues: - 
ISSUES:

assessed by respondents according to market value and 
petitioner is being compensated for lesser amount and is 
entitled to enhanced compensation? OPA

acquired land and damages he sustained @ Rs.20,00,000/-
/25,00,000/- per Acre along with interest instead of 
Rs.11,50,000/- per Acre? OPA 
3. 
Whether possession of petitioner’s property was taken 
immediately after issuance of Notification u/s 4 whereas 
Award was announced on 16.06.2017? OPA 
4.

7. 
Relief. 
 
After recording evidence and hearing arguments from all 
sides, the Referee Court, vide judgment dated 07.01.2023, 
accepted the Reference Application in above terms. Hence, this 
appeal. 
3. 
Learned counsel for appellant submits that all the 
documentary evidence, adduced by respondent No.1, was 
exhibited in the statement of learned counsel, therefore, the 
same has no evidentiary value in view of dictum laid down by 
the superior Court. He adds that even all these documents were 
executed after issuance of Notification u/s 4 of the Act of 1894, 
thus, the same are irrelevant as per Rule 10(1)(iii)(C) of the 
Punjab Land Acquisition Rules, 1983. He argues that certain 
documents were produced and only ‘marked’, therefore, such 
documents had no legal value and sanctity in the eye of law.  
He further submits that respondent No.1 failed to prove exact 
price of the acquired land through tangible evidence and 

3 
RFA No.20881 of 2023 
received the award amount without any objection, hence the 
Referee Court was not justified to amplify the compensation to 
such a huge magnitude. He contends that the reference 
application remained pending for five years for no fault on the 
part of acquiring agency, hence, there was no lawful 
justification to award the compound interest, which even 
otherwise is not mandatory rather is discretionary as per section 
28 of the Act of 1894. In support of his contentions, he has 
relied upon Government of N.-W.F.P. and others v. Akbar Shah 
and others (2010 SCMR 1408), Manzoor Hussain (deceased) 
through L.Rs. v. Misri Khan (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 749), 
Mst. Akhtar Sultana v. Major Retd. Muzaffar Khan Malik 
through his legal heirs and others (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 
715), Mst. Fatima and 2 others v. Najeeb Ullah and another 
(2020 CLC 780), Lahore Ring Road Authority and others v. 
Mian Mumtaz Ahmad and others (2021 CLC 178) and 
Muhammad Hussain and another v. Province of Punjab 
through District Officer Revenue, Multan and others (2021 
YLR 2310). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.1 submits 
that the acquired land was of prime quality for cultivation of 
vegetables / farming and being near to village abadi was 
suitable for residential purpose as well, therefore, the value / 
price of compensation should have been assessed at 
Rs.25,00,000/- per Acre. He adds that appellant has evasively 
denied the stance of respondent No.1 instead of rebutting the 
same through any direct evidence, which amounts to admission 
on the part of appellant. He adds that the price assessed by the 
Land Acquisition Collector was neither proper nor adequate as 
relevant factors, inter-alia, market value at the relevant time 
coupled with its potential value, time consumed in finalization 
of acquisition proceedings / payment of compensation and trend 
of increasing prices of lands located adjacent to the lands of 

4 
RFA No.20881 of 2023 
respondent No.1 have not been taken into consideration at the 
time of announcement of award. In the end, he prays that 
compensation fixed by the Referee Court be maintained. He has 
placed reliance on Wasab Khan and another v. Mst. Bagh Bhari 
and 5 others (2017 MLD 1552), Muhammad Munawar v. 
Abdul Razaq and 6 others (2018 CLC 1227), Usman Khan v. 
Mst. Shehla Gul and 2 others (2020 CLC 910), Muhammad 
Akhtar v. Mst. Manna and 3 others (2001 SCMR 1700), Malik 
Tariq Mahmood and others v. Province of Punjab and others 
(2023 SCMR 102), Federal Government of Pakistan through 
Ministry of Defence Rawalpindi and others v. Mst. Zakia 
Begum and others (PLD 2023 Supreme Court 277), National 
Highway Authority v. Rai Ahmad Nawaz Khan and others 
(2023 SCMR 700) and Nawabzada Abdul Qadir han and 
others v. Land Acquisition Collector Mardan and others (2023 
SCMR 950). 
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
Undeniably, land of respondent No.1 was acquired and 
he was held entitled to get compensation of the same by the 
Land Acquisition Collector, therefore, issues No.4, 5, 6 & 7 
were rightly decided against appellant. Even, these issues have 
not been seriously pressed before this Court.  
 
The major controversy revolves around issues No.1 to 3, 
gist whereof is whether value determined by the Referee Court 
was accurate or that fixed by the Land Acquisition Collector 
was fair and just?  
 
7. 
Respondent No.1 himself appeared as AW-1 and 
produced Safdar Ali as AW-2. Documentary evidence contains 
documents Ex.A-1 to Ex.A-17 and Mark-A to Mark-H. 
Whereas, Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi, Assistant Director Land 
appeared in the witness box as RW-1 & Safwan ul Haq, 
Tehsildar Kamoke as RW-2 and mutations of Mouza Hayati 

5 
RFA No.20881 of 2023 
bearing Nos.613, 615, 617 & 618 were tendered as Ex.R-1 to 
Ex.R-4, respectively.  
 
8. 
Learned counsel for appellant has raised serious 
objection qua admissibility of documentary evidence tendered 
by respondent No.1, being exhibited in the statement of learned 
counsel, however he frankly admitted the genuineness and 
veracity of Ex.A-4, which is minutes of meeting of District 
Price Assessment Committee (DPAC), held on 03.08.2016. 
This document shows that schedule rate of off-road land of 
Mouza Hayati was assessed as Rs.10,50,000/- and market value 
as Rs.15,00,000/- per Acre, by the Assistant Commissioner 
Kamoke, however column average sale price per Acre is blank. 
 
 
When confronted with the legal position that the 
documentary evidence was exhibited in the statement of 
counsel and the same has no evidentiary value, learned counsel 
for respondent No.1 submits that he would be satisfied if 
compensation is fixed as per market value of acquired land 
given in Ex.A-4 i.e. Rs.15,00,000/- per Acre. 
 
 
On being faced with the above, learned counsel for 
appellant admits that the aforesaid market value of the acquired 
land was fixed by the Assistant Commissioner concerned but 
the DPAC reduced it to Rs.10,50,000/- per Acre. He was asked 
to show the reasons for reducing the compensation of the 
acquired land and further confronted with the facts; that the 
AWs claimed market value of the acquired land from 
Rs.20,00,000/- to Rs.25,00,000/- per Acre in their depositions 
and during cross-examination their stance remained the same; 
that the RWs, who are neither members of DPAC nor persons 
who assessed the value, could not substantiate that the LAC 
fixed the compensation by keeping in view the market value 
and potential value of the acquired land; and that the market 
value of off-road lands in adjacent villages i.e. Pul Shah Dola (a 
nearest village) has been assessed as Rs.17,00,000/- per Acre, 

6 
RFA No.20881 of 2023 
however the same was not considered while fixing the 
compensation of the acquired land. In response, learned counsel 
could not advance any satisfactory reply.  
 
  
 
10. 
The Referee Court has taken into consideration the 
market value, potentiality and value of the adjacent lands on the 
basis of documentary evidence tendered by respondent No.1, 
which clearly shows value / price of adjacent lands on higher 
side. However, the Apex Court of the country has laid down in 
a number of judgments that documentary evidence cannot be 
exhibited in the statement of counsel including the cases 
reported as Manzoor Hussain (deceased) through L.Rs. v.  
Misri Khan (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 749), Mst. Akhtar 
Sultana v. Major Retd. Muzaffar Khan Malik through his legal 
heirs and others (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 715) and Mst. 
Rasoolan Bibi v. Province of Punjab and others (2023 CLC 
1171). The verdict given by the Supreme Court is binding on 
all Courts of the country within the contemplation of Article 
189 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973.  
 
11. 
In this view of the matter, compensation of the acquired 
land is being fixed by adopting the market value mentioned in 
Ex.A-4, which document although brought on record in the 
statement of learned counsel for respondent No.1 but learned 
counsel for appellant has admitted it to be correct and has 
neither 
raised 
serious 
objection 
for 
determination 
of 
compensation in line thereof nor could show that the said 
determination was not in conformity with the market price 
through any irrefutable documentary proof. In the given 
circumstances, this Court finds no exception to it especially 
when learned counsel for respondent No.1 has also agreed to it 
to end the litigation.  
 
12. 
Needless to say that the concept that documents cannot 
be admitted into evidence solely through the statement of 

7 
RFA No.20881 of 2023 
counsel during evidence is rooted in the fundamental right to 
cross-examination, which is an essential aspect of the 
adversarial legal system. The right to cross-examination allows 
the opposing party to challenge the veracity, authenticity, and 
relevance of the evidence presented, including documents. If 
documents were to be admitted solely on the statements of 
counsel, it would indeed compromise the right of the other 
party to cross-examine, which is not warranted by law. 
Therefore, the trial Courts must ensure that all documentary 
evidence is subject to the scrutiny of cross-examination to 
uphold the principles of fairness and due process. Documents 
exhibited solely through the statements of counsel without the 
opportunity for cross-examination would not meet the legal 
standards for admissibility of evidence. This ensures the 
integrity of the judicial process and the rights of the parties 
involved. The superior Courts of the country have also enriched 
the law through their judgments, setting precedents for the 
proper admission of documents and evaluation. The Courts 
must ensure so far as it is possible that these legal standards are 
met to maintain the integrity of the judicial process and uphold 
the rights of the parties involved.  
 
13. 
Before parting with this judgment, I am constrained to 
observe that in this case, respondent No.1 got exhibited as 
many as seventeen (17) documents during statement of his 
learned counsel, and the Referee Court as well as learned 
counsel for the parties in total oblivion of the legal position 
developed so far allowed the documents to be exhibited, 
however such exercise is not permissible under well-established 
principles of law enunciated by the superior Courts in a number 
of judgments, some of them have also been cited supra. In this 
way, the best evidence being helpful to resolve the controversy 
is lost which seriously affects the precious rights of the parties. 
Therefore, this Court directs that copy of this judgment be 

8 
RFA No.20881 of 2023 
circulated to all the Courts in District Judiciary Punjab as well 
as Presidents of Bar Associations at Tehsil and District levels 
throughout Punjab for strict adherence to ensure substantial 
justice and to save the parties from substantial loss.   
14. 
In view of the above, instant appeal is partly allowed in 
the manner that compensation of acquired land of respondent 
No.1 is hereby fixed as Rs.15,00,000/- per Acre along with 
15% compulsory acquisition charges and compound interest @ 
8% from the date of possession of the acquired land to the date 
of payment of enhanced amount of compensation.
