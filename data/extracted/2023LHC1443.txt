2. 
By way of this petition under Article 199 of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973, the State through learned Addl. Prosecutor 
General has called in question validity of 

Writ Petition No.13218/2018 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          2 
 
impugned order dated 10.03.2018, passed by the 
learned Addl. Sessions Judge, designated as Judge 
Electricity Utilities Court, Sahiwal, whereby the 
said court while referring to the provisions of 
Section 462-O PPC opined that in cases of theft of 
electricity only a “complaint” can be filed by a 
duly authorized officer (not below grade-17) 
before the designated Court and the FIR could not 
be registered in such like cases and returned report 
under Section 173 Cr.P.C. to the prosecution with 
the direction to file complaint.  
3. 
Facts necessary for disposal of instant writ 
petition are that, Zahid Mehmood, Sub Divisional 
Officer, Civil Lines, Sub Division Sahiwal got 
lodged the FIR No.296/2017 dated 24.09.2017, in 
respect of an offence U/S 462-J PPC, at P.S. 
Bahadar Shah, District Sahiwal against the 
respondent with the allegation that on 21.09.2017 
at about 3.25 p.m. he was found committing theft 
of electricity through direct wire from the main 
PVC line of WAPDA. Report U/S 173 Cr.P.C. was 
prepared and sent up to the court of competent 
jurisdiction for trial, where the learned Trial Court 
by way of impugned order dated 10.03.2018     
declared the aforesaid FIR void ab-initio and 
returned the report U/S 173 Cr.P.C. with direction 
to the prosecution to file complaint according to 
the provisions of Section 462-O PPC, which is 
subject matter of this writ petition.  
4. 
I have heard the learned Law Officers, 
learned counsel for the respondent/ accused and 
gone through the record.  
5. 
In order to curb menace of theft of 
electricity, the legislature in its wisdom  has 
amended Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 through “ The 

Writ Petition No.13218/2018 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          3 
 
Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2016”, whereby a 
new 
Chapter 
XVII-B 
was 
inserted. 
Simultaneously, Schedule II of Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898 was also amended, so as to make 
the offences mentioned in the aforesaid Chapter as 
cognizable and non-bailable. By declaring the 
offences mentioned in aforesaid Chapter as 
cognizable intention of the legislature is manifestly 
clear that registration of FIR in such like offences 
was very much permissible. It appears that the 
learned Trial Court while passing impugned order 
misconstrued the provisions of Section 462-O of 
PPC. Before proceeding further it is appropriate to 
go through the provisions of said Section which 
reads as under:- 
“462-O Cognizance.--- (1) The Court shall try 
an offence punishable under this Chapter.  
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 or any other law for the time 
being in force, the Court shall not take cognizance of an 
offence under this Chapter except on a complaint made, 
with reasons to be recorded in writing along with full 
particulars of the offence committed under this Chapter, 
by duly authorized officer (not below Grade 17) of the 
Government or the distribution company, as the case 
may be.” 
Learned Trial Court has confused the 
expression “cognizance” mentioned in Section 
462-O PPC and has failed to comprehend that 
taking cognizance of an offence by a Court is 
entirely a distinct feature from lodging of the crime 
report or investigation of an offence by the police 
or anyother investigating agency.  The Trial Court 
remained oblivious of the fact that Section 462-O 
PPC deals only for taking cognizance of offence 
by a Court and has nothing to do with the prior 
actions in the shape of registration of F.I.R. or 

Writ Petition No.13218/2018 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          4 
 
investigation thereon. In case reported as “Zeeshan 
Anjum ..Vs.. The State and others (2022 MLD 
1091)”, it has been held by this Court that:- 
“Cognizance is a later stage in a criminal 
process when the court for the first time takes notices of 
an offence on a police report or on a complaint by a 
private person. Before that criminal process if initiated 
under Section 154 Cr.P.C. for cognizable offences and 
155, Cr.P.C. for non-cognizable offences, it has to pass 
through the stage of investigation, purpose whereof is 
collection of evidence which guides to prosecute or not 
to prosecute. In ordinary offences, court under section 
190, Cr.P.C. is authorized to take cognizance plainly on 
a police report or on a private complainant within the 
contours of such section without attending any peculiar 
condition; in in certain situations, cognizance is 
restricted based on public policy in order to govern the 
cases with controlled prosecution. Sections 195 to 199 of 
Cr.P.C. is the response of what has been stated above.” 
As has been observed supra, Section 462-O 
PPC only deals with taking cognizance of an 
offence by a Court, as such the same does not 
place an embargo upon reporting of an offence by 
the Officer not below Grade-17 to the police or 
registration 
of 
FIR 
pursuant 
to 
such 
report/complaint. In case reported as “Industrial 
Development Bank of Pakistan and others ..Vs.. 
Mian Asim Fareed and others (2006 SCMR 483)”, 
it has been laid down as under:- 
“ Needless to add that the registration of an 
F.I.R. and taking of cognizance of cases were two 
distinct and independent concepts under the criminal 
law; that if the intention of the law-maker was to put any 
clog on the registration of an F.I.R. then the Legislature 
would have said so specifically and that if the law put a 
condition only on the taking of cognizance then it can 
never be read to imply prohibition on registration of 
F.I.Rs.”

6. 
The respondent was booked in the instant 
case under Section 462-J PPC and according to 
Schedule II of Cr.P.C. said offence was a 
“cognizable offence”. “Cognizable offence” has 
been defined in Section 4(1)(f) of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898 which reads as under:- 
“Cognizable offence;” “Cognizable 
Case.” “Cognizable offence” means a case in 
which a police officer, may, in accordance with the 
second schedule or under any law for the time being 
in force, arrest without warrant.”  
7. 
There seems no confusion in the criminal 
jurisprudence that in order to cause arrest of an 
accused in a cognizable offence, registration of 
FIR is sina qua non. Therefore, by no stretch of 
imagination it can be concluded that by inserting 
Section 462-O PPC intention of the legislature was 
to place an embargo upon registration of First 
Information Report in cases mentioned in Chapter 
XVII-B. 
8. 
In order to draw an analogy, we have to go 
through identical law known as “Gas (Theft 
Control and Recovery) Act, 2016, where question 
of taking cognizance was regulated under Section 
5(2) of the said Act, which reads as under:- 
“Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 
this Act, Gas Utility Court shall not take cognizance of 
any offence punishable under the Act except upon a 
complaint made in writing by a person authorized in this 
behalf by the Gas Utility company in respect of which 
offence was committed.” 
  Section 24 of the said Act deals with the 
status of offences which reads as under:- 
“ Notwithstanding anything contained in the 
Code of Criminal Procedure (Act V of 1898). All 
offences under this Act if committed by any person other 

Writ Petition No.13218/2018 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          6 
 
than a domestic consumer shall be cognizable and non-
bailable.”  
9. 
In somewhat similar situation offender of 
the aforesaid law while placing reliance on Section 
5(2) of the Act ibid seeks quashing of FIR and the 
Apex Court in judgment reported as “Mian 
Haroon Riaz Lucky and another ..Vs.. The State 
and others (2021 SCMR 56)” has observed as 
under:- 
“ Similarly, there is a wide variety of offences 
both under the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 as well as 
under various special laws that require prior sanction for 
prosecution for the purposes of assumption of 
cognizance by the trial Court, the requirement does not 
stand in impediment to the registration of First 
Information 
Report, 
arrest 
of 
an 
offender 
or 
commencement of investigation thereof as the clog of 
sanction transiently relates to the step preparatory thereto 
by the authority designated under the Statute; in the 
present case, a procedure to be routed through Section 
5(2) of the Act.” 
Survey of the above discussion leads me to 
an irresistible conclusion that provisions of Section 
462-O PPC does not prohibit registration of First 
Information Report in offences mentioned in 
Chapter XVII-B, PPC as all the offences 
mentioned therein have been described as 
cognizable in Schedule II of Cr.P.C.  However, 
while taking cognizance the Trial Court ought to 
have considered as to whether the complaint has 
been filed by an authorized officer (not below 
Grade 17) of the Government or the distribution 
company as the case may be and the same 
discloses reasons in writing with full particulars of 
offences committed under this Chapter and if at 
that stage, the Trial Court arrived at a conclusion 
that report U/S 173 Cr.P.C. is not in conformity 

Writ Petition No.13218/2018 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          7 
 
with the provisions of Section 462-O PPC, he may 
pass an appropriate order in this regard. In order to 
avoid any such lacuna, it is expected that the 
learned Prosecutors before forwarding report U/S 
173 Cr.P.C. shall ensure that it fulfills the 
requirement of Section 462-O PPC.  
10. 
For what has been discussed above, this writ 
petition as well as connected petitions are allowed, 
as a result whereof impugned order of the Trial 
Court dated 10.03.2018 is set-aside. Matter is 
remanded to the Trial Court with direction to 
proceed further with the same, in view of the 
observations made herein above.
