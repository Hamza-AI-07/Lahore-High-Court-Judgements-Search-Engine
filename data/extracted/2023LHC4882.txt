fourwalls of her residential premises "رہائشی احاطہ" after litting electric bulb; in 
the intervening night of 01.08.2015, accused persons No.1, 2 and 3 (i.e. 
Faisal, Mujahid and Nishan, respectively) with firearm weapons came into the 
courtyard after jumping the wall whereas two unknown remained present 
outside; accused No.1 (Faisal) fired straight shot at Abdul Razzaq (son of the 
complainant) which hit him above right side of temporal region "پٹپڑی"; after 
hearing report (آواز) of shot fired and noise when the complainant awoke, she 
identified accused persons No.1, 2 and 3 (i.e. Faisal, Mujahid and Nishan, 
respectively) in the light of bulb and when the accused persons ran, two 
muffled faces also fled away with them; after hearing report (آواز) of shot fired 
and noise, Fazil, Allah Yar and other people of the vicinity also reached the 
place of occurrence who also saw the occurrence and accused persons 
succeeded to flee away after brandishing their weapons; Abdul Razzaq was 
taken to District Hospital, Okara in injured condition from where medical 
certificate (نتیجہ ڈاکٹری) was obtained and due to his critical condition, he was 
referred to Lahore; complainant was busy in taking care of her son, came to 
the police station on 02.08.2015 at 01:50 p.m. and prayed for registration of 
case. On the basis of aforementioned application (Ex.PA), case was registered 
vide F.I.R. No.176/2015 (Ex.PJ) on 02.08.2015 under Sections: 324, 148, 149 
PPC (subsequently, after death of Abdul Razaque on 14.08.2015 at Jinah 
Hospital, Lahore, offence under Section: 302 PPC was added) at Police 
Station: Ravi, District: Okara.  
  
Being dissatisfied with the conduct of the police, complainant filed 
“complaint” (Ex.PB) against Faisal, Mujahid, Iqbal alias Shan and Zubaida 
Bibi alias Baido under Sections: 302, 324, 148, 149, 109 PPC alleging therein 
that she is resident of Basti Noorekey, Tehsil & District: Okara and a 
housewife; in the intervening night of 31/01.08.2015, she along with Fazil and 
Allah Yar slept in the courtyard of fourwalls of her residential premises after 
litting electric bulb; accused persons namely Faisal armed with pistol, 
Mujahid armed with pistol and Iqbal alias Shan armed with pistol came into 
the courtyard after jumping the wall and opened the gate whereas two 
unknown remained present outside; on hearing the noise "کھڑاک کی آ واز پر", 
complainant, Fazil and Allah Yar awoke and in their view, Faisal armed with 
pistol raised lalkra that today he will take revenge of murder of his father and 
will not left Abdul Razaq alive; in their view, Faisal fired shot at Abdul 
Razzaq (son of the complainant) with pistol with the intention to kill him,

which hit at right side above his temporal area "پٹپڑی"; occurrence was seen by 
the witnesses in the light of bulb; when complainant and witnesses tried to 
apprehend the accused persons, Iqbal alias Shan pointed his pistol at the 
witnesses whereas Mujahid accused pointed his pistol at the complainant that 
if anyone tried to intervene, he would be killed; accused persons while raising 
lalkara fled away from the spot.  
Motive behind the occurrence (as per complaint Ex.PB) was that it was 
an allegation of accused Faisal that Abdul Razzaq had murdered his father and 
in this respect, case arising out of F.I.R. No.43/10 dated: 16.05.2010 was 
registered under Sections: 302/34 PPC at Police Station: Kalyana, District: 
Pakpattan Sharif against Abdul Razzaque and due to this grudge, accused 
persons have committed the occurrence.   
 
It has been also mentioned in aforementioned complaint (Ex.PB) that in 
this occurrence, Mst. Zubaida Bibi alias Baido had given information through 
phone to accused Faisal about presence of Abdul Razzaque (now deceased of 
the case) in the house and got stayed accused Faisal as well as Mujahid in her 
house prior to the occurrence; planning for the occurrence was made in the 
house of Mst. Zubaida Bibi alias Baido; on 31.07.2015 at about 05/06:00 
p.m., Muhammad Amir and Walayat had seen and heard Faisal, Mujahid, 
Iqbal alias Shan and Mst. Zubaida Bibi alias Baido while making planning 
for the occurrence. The complainant got lodged case arising out of F.I.R. 
No.176/2015 (Ex.PJ) under Sections: 302, 324, 148, 149, 109 PPC at Police 
Station: Ravi, District: Okara against accused persons, however, local police 
was destroying the evidence of the complainant, hence complaint was filed.  
 
It is pertinent to mention here that out of four accused persons 
{mentioned in the complaint Ex.PB)}, Iqbal alias Shan was separately tried as 
“juvenile” in the case and Mujahid was declared as “proclaimed offender” 
whereas Faisal (appellant) and Mst. Zubaida Bibi alias Baido were formally 
charge sheeted to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial; 
complainant produced twelve witnesses to prove the charge against the 
accused whereas three witnesses were examined by the trial court as Court 
Witnesses; ocular account was furnished by Mst. Khurshid Bibi 
(complainant/PW-1) and Allah Yar (PW-2), evidence regarding abetment was 
given by Amir Shahzad (PW-3), medical evidence was furnished by                 
Dr. Ishtiaq Ali (PW-5) and Dr. Abdul Hameed (PW-7) whereas Abdul Sattar 
S.I. (PW-8), Nazir Ahmad S.I. (PW-10), Yaqoob S.I. (PW-12), Aslam Parvaiz 

Criminal Appeal No.66322-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.194/2019.

S.I. (CW-1) and Muhammad Imran S.I. (CW-2) deposed about investigation 
of the case. Thereafter statements of the appellant and his co-accused were 
recorded under Section: 342 Cr.P.C. in which they refuted the allegations 
levelled against them; they did not opt to appear as their own witnesses under 
Section: 340(2) Cr.P.C. and the appellant did not produce any evidence in his 
defence, however, Mst. Zubaida Bibi alias Baido produced photocopy of 
petition tilted as “Zubaida Bibi vs. D.P.O. etc.” as Mark-DA alongwith carbon 
copy of MLC No.722/15 as Ex.DC in her defence.  
Trial Court after conclusion of trial while acquitting co-accused namely 
Mst. Zubaida Bibi alias Baido, has convicted and sentenced the appellant as 
mentioned above through impugned judgment dated: 28.06.2019. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that conviction 
recorded and sentence awarded to the appellant through impugned judgment 
are against the ‘law and facts’ of the case; ocular account is neither 
trustworthy nor corroborated/supported by any other independent evidence; 
prosecution has remained unable to prove its case. Learned counsel for the 
appellant finally prayed for acquittal of the appellant. 
5. 
Learned Deputy Prosecutor General and learned counsel for the 
complainant have supported the impugned judgment and prayed for dismissal 
of the appeal.   
6. 
Arguments heard.  Record perused. 
7.   
As per case of prosecution, occurrence took place during the 
intervening night of 31/01.08.2015 (however exact time not disclosed) 
whereas case was registered vide F.I.R. (Ex.PJ) at 01:50 p.m. on 02.08.2015 
on the application (Ex.PA) moved by Mst. Khurshid Bibi (complainant/PW-1) 
at 01:50 p.m. on 02.08.2015 to Zulfiqar Ali A.S.I. (PW-6) in Police Station: 
Ravi, District: Okara. Admittedly, case has not been registered promptly 
although place of occurrence was just at a distance of 01-kilometer from the 
police station as per Column No.4 of F.I.R. (Ex.PJ). Undoubtedly, in case of 
receipt of injuries by the person, usually attendants prefer to first take him to 
hospital for medical aid and then to move for registration of case, however, 
each case has its own facts, therefore, “aspect of time” consumed in 
registration of case has to be examined in the light of circumstances of the 
case; as per application (Ex.PA), after receipt of injury by Abdul Razzaq (the 
then injured), he was shifted to District Hospital, Okara, from there he was 
referred to Lahore; Mst. Khurshid Bibi (complainant/PW-1) remained busy in 

Criminal Appeal No.66322-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.194/2019.

looking after (تیمارداری) the injured, then on 02.08.2015 came to police station 
and moved application for registration of case. However, close scrutiny of the 
record reveals that Mst. Khurshid Bibi (complainant/PW-1) herself admitted 
in her statement before the Court that just after 20-minutes of the occurrence, 
police reached at the place of occurrence, she i.e. Mst. Khurshid Bibi 
(complainant/PW-1) narrated whole occurrence to the police, her statement 
regarding the occurrence was recorded by the police, preliminary 
investigation was also conducted by the police at the place of occurrence and 
police accompanied Abdul Razzaque (the then injured) to District 
Headquarter Hospital, Okara; relevant portions of statement of Mst. Khurshid 
Bibi (PW-1) are hereby reproduced: - 
“After 20 minutes of this occurrence police reached the place of 
occurrence. I narrated the whole occurrence before the police. 
Police recorded my statement regarding this occurrence.”  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis added) 
 
“Police conducted preliminary investigation at the place of 
occurrence at about 10/15 minutes. Thereafter we shifted Abdul 
Razzaq the then injured to DHQ Hospital, Okara in private car, 
local police were also accompanied with us.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis added) 
 
In this regard, relevant portion of statement of Muhammad Yaqoob S.I.           
(PW-12) is also being reproduced below: - 
“It is correct that Abdul Razzaq was medical his examined through 
police.” 
 
Perusal of Medicolegal Examination Certificate of Abdul Razzaq (Ex.PK, 
available at Page No.191-192 of the paper book) also reveals that said 
certificate was received by police official.  
  
Aforementioned facts clearly show that police reached at the place of 
occurrence just after 20 minutes of the occurrence i.e. during night of 31/01 of 
August, 2015, conducted preliminary investigation there, recorded statement of 
Mst. Khurshid Bibi (complainant/PW-1) there, accompanied injured to District 
Headquarter Hospital, Okara and obtained his MLC, therefore, first information 
regarding the occurrence in this case as required and defined in Section: 154 
Cr.P.C. is that statement which was got recorded by Mst. Khurshid Bibi at the 
spot just after the occurrence and case must had been registered on the basis of 
said statement but same has been suppressed by the prosecution and case has 
been registered with much delay on 02.08.2015 on the basis of application 
(Ex.PA) moved by the complainant in the police station.

Murder Reference No.194/2019.

Of course, F.I.R. is an important document which brings machinery of 
law into motion; reason for giving/attaching much weight to this document is 
that it contains first information regarding the occurrence which is provided to 
police after the occurrence and it is presumed that it contains firsthand 
knowledge about the occurrence without any adulteration, addition or 
omission so promptness of its recording enhances its efficacy; furthermore, 
the very first narration regarding the occurrence got recorded by complainant 
to police official is practically first information under Section: 154 Cr.P.C. 
whereas any statement or application subsequently given or moved to police is 
statement under Section: 161 Cr.P.C. Hence, in peculiar facts and 
circumstances of this case, statement got recorded by complainant to police at 
the spot (mentioned above) is as a matter of fact “first information” which has 
been suppressed by the prosecution and not brought on record whereas 
application (Ex.PA) moved by the complainant at the most can be termed as 
“statement under Section: 161 Cr.P.C.” and cannot be treated as “first 
information under Section: 154 Cr.P.C.”. Non-bringing of first statement 
regarding the occurrence got recorded by complainant to police at the spot on 
the record gives rise to the presumption that had it been brought on record as 
“F.I.R.” than it was not going to support the case of prosecution. 
Aforementioned state of affairs clearly reflects that when police station was 
just 01-k.m. away from the spot, police came at the spot just after 20 minutes 
of the occurrence, accompanied the injured to hospital, obtained MLC also, in 
spite of recording statement of complainant at the spot of occurrence as well 
as conducting preliminary investigation did not register the case till 
02.08.2015, then case has been registered with unexplained delay and in this 
regard, relevant portion of statement of Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (PW-12) is 
reproduced below: - 
“It is correct that F.I.R. of this case was registered after the delay of 
two days.” 
 
which further reflects that this time has been consumed for deliberation, 
consultation, concoction and tailoring false story after engaging and procuring 
witnesses and thereafter case has been registered through F.I.R. (Ex.PJ) on the 
basis of application (Ex.PA). Therefore, F.I.R. which is always considered as 
“cornerstone” has lost its value in the case and superstructure i.e. case of 
prosecution erected on the basis of this F.I.R. is bound to fall like house of 
cards; in this regard, guidance has been sought from the case of “GHULAM 

Criminal Appeal No.66322-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.194/2019.

ABBAS and another versus The STATE and another” (2021 S C M R 23), 
“PERVAIZ KHAN and another versus The STATE” (2022 S C M R 393) and 
“ABDUL GHAFOOR versus The STATE” (2022 S C M R 1527) 
 
 
Although police immediately reached at the place of occurrence just          
in 20 minutes after the occurrence yet neither any empty-shell of 
bullet/cartridge nor blood stained earth could be collected from there thus 
question does arise that either said claimed place was the place of occurrence?  
Any bulb, pedestal fan or cot was also not taken into possession from the spot; 
in this regard, relevant portion of statement of Muhammad Yaqoob S.I.             
(PW-12) is reproduced as under: - 
“It is correct that I had not taken into possession any bulb through 
recovery memo from the place of occurrence. It is correct that I also 
had not taken into possession blood stained earth, any crime empty 
pedestal fan, any cot from the place of occurrence.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis added) 
 
Now coming to the ocular account produced by prosecution which comprises 
of statements of Mst. Khurshid Bibi (complainant/PW-1) and Allah Yar            
(PW-2). Mst. Khurshid Bibi (complainant/PW-1) is mother of Abdul Razzaq 
(deceased of the case). Perusal of application for registration of case (Ex.PA) 
reveals that occurrence took place during night, complainant was sleeping, 
making of more than one fire shot by accused is not mentioned therein, 
complainant awoke on hearing report (آواز) of shot fired and noise meaning 
thereby that she could not see that who fired? Furthermore, as per application 
(Ex.PA), Fazil, Allah Yar and other men (مرد مان) of village came at spot on 
hearing report (آواز) of shot fired as well as noise, so they also did not see any 
one making fire at Abdul Razzaque because repetition of making fire is not 
mentioned in the application (Ex.PA); in this regard, relevant portions of 
statement of Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (PW-12) are reproduced as under: - 
“It is correct that it was the version of the complainant in Ex.PA that 
the PWs also attracted to the place of occurrence after hearing the 
noise of fire.” 
 
“It was version of the PWs before me that after hearing the noise of 
fire they reached at the house of Khurshid Bibi/complainant where 
complainant told that she had identified accused Faisal, Mujahid 
and Shan.” 
 
This shows that neither complainant nor cited eyewitnesses saw any assailant 
while making fire shot at Abdul Razzaque. Specific kind of firearm weapon 
was not narrated by complainant in Ex.PA and in this regard, relevant portion 
of Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (PW-12) is reproduced as under: - 

Criminal Appeal No.66322-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.194/2019.

“It is correct that as per Ex.PA complainant had not mentioned any 
specific kind of weapon in Ex.PA.” 
 
Even at the time of preparing un-scaled site plan of occurrence (Ex.PM), kind 
of firearm weapon was not disclosed by the complainant or cited 
eyewitnesses; in this regard, relevant portions of statement of PW-12 are as 
under: - 
“I prepared the un-scaled site plan on the pointation of complainant 
and PWs.” 
 
“It is correct that neither the complainant nor the PWs pointed out 
before about the kind of fire arm weapon nor I mentioned the same 
in Ex.PM.” 
 
 
Complainant (PW-1) after introducing dishonest improvements and omissions 
filed complaint (Ex.PB) with much delay on 08.12.2016 and while appearing 
as PW-1, Mst. Khursheed Bibi (complainant) made following dishonest 
improvements and deliberate omissions for strengthening the case; - 
“I got recorded in my application Exh.PA that I alongwith Fanzal, 
Allah Yar, Abdul Razzaq and other family members were sleeping in 
the courtyard. Confronted with Exh.PA where words "I alongwith 
Faazal. Allah Yar and Abdul Razzaq" were not so recorded. I got 
recorded in my application Exh.PA that accused Faisal armed with 
pistol 30-bore, Mujahid armed with pistol 30-bore sons of Sadiq, 
Iqbal alias Shan armed with pistol 30-bore. Confronted with Ex.PA 
where the words "armed with pistol 30-bore" were not so recorded 
whereas firearm weapon was mentioned. I got recorded in my 
statement that the accused persons unlocked the chain of door of 
Ahata and we woke up while hearing the voice of chain/kundi. 
Confronted with Ex.PA where it is not so recorded. I got recorded in 
my application Exh.PA that in the meanwhile accused Faisal raised 
lalkara that today Abdul Razaq be murdered because he had 
murdered my father. Confronted with Ex PA where it is not so 
recorded. I got recorded in my application Exh PA that on our view 
accused made a fire shot. Confronted with Ex PA where the word on 
our view not so recorded. I got recorded in my application Exh.PA 
that we tried to catch hold of accused Faisal then the accused 
Mujahid and Iqbal aimed their pistols toward us and threatened if 
anyone tried to intercept, would face the consequences. Confronted 
with Ex PA where it is not so recorded: I got recorded in my 
application Exh.PA that thereafter the above said accused persons 
decamped from the place of occurrence while raising lalkara. 
Confronted with Ex PA where it is not so ear recorded. However, it 
is recorded that they succeeded to flee away while brandishing their 
respective weapons. I got recorded in my application ExhiPA that 
when we followed the accused persons, two unknown accused 
persons armed with deadly weapons were also present in the house. 
Confronted with Ex PA where it is not so recorded. I did not get 
recorded in my statement that after hearing the noise and voice of 
fire I awoke up and identified the accused persons in the light of 
bulb. Confronted with Ex PA where it is so recorded from portion 
"A" to "A" Witness volunteers that I awoke up after hearing the 
voice of chain/kundi and identified the accused persons. It is 

Criminal Appeal No.66322-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.194/2019.

incorrect to suggest that, volunteer portion of my statement is 
incorrect and false. I did not get recorded in my application Exh.PA 
that when accused persons fled away alongwith two unknown 
muffled faces, then while hearing the noise and voice of fire Faazal 
son of Baila, Allah Yar son of Mohsin and other people of vicinity 
came the place of occurrence and witnessed the occurrence. 
Confronted with Ehx.PA where it was so recorded from 'B' to 'B' 
Witness volunteers that witnesses were already sleeping inside the 
house and witnessed the occurrence, It is incorrect to suggest that I 
have made dishonest improvement in order to become the eye 
witness of this case. It is incorrect to suggest that I have made 
dishonest improvements in order to strengthen my false case. I got 
recorded in my application Exh.PA that motive behind the 
occurrence was that Faisal accused had leveled allegation that 
Abdul Razzaq deceased had murdered his father and due to this 
grudge accused Faisal etc. committed the murder of my son Abdul 
Razzaq Confronted with Ehx.PA where it is not so recorded. It is 
incorrect to suggest that I had introduced a false motive to 
strengthen my false case. It is incorrect to suggest that I had 
introduced a false motive in my private complaint at belated stage 
after taking legal assistance just to strengthen my case.” 
 
“I got recorded in my application Exh.DA that whole the occurrence 
was committed on the abetment of said Zubaida Bibi. I got recorded 
in application Exh.DA that Mst Zubaida Bib accused telephonically 
informed about the presence of Abdul Razzaq to accused Faisal and 
Mujahid, Confronted with Exh.DA where it is not so recorded. I got 
recorded in application Exh.DA that on 31.07.2015 at about 5/6:00 
p.m. accused persons Mujahid, Faisal, Iqbal and Zubaida made plan 
regarding the murder of my son Abdul Razzaq. Confronted with 
Exh.DA where it is not so recorded. I got recorded in my statement 
Exh.DA that Walayat son of Mohsin, Amir son of Yasin heard and 
witnessed the above mentioned conspiracy and thereafter informed 
me. Confronted with Exh.DA where it is not so recorded. It is 
incorrect to suggest that I have made a dishonest improvement at 
belated stage in order to create a false evidence against the accused 
persons. It is incorrect to suggest that I introduced a false piece of 
evidence just to strengthen my false case.” 
 
Similarly, Allay Yar (PW-2) also introduced dishonest improvements as well 
as intentional omissions in his statement before the Court; relevant portion of 
his statement is as under: - 
“I got recorded in my statement under section 161. Cr.P.C., Exh.DB 
that on 31/1-07/08-2015 | alongwith Mst. Khurshid Bibi., Abdul Razzaq

Exh.DB where it is so recorded from Portion 'B' to 'B'. It is incorrect to 
suggest that I have made a dishonest Improvement in order to 
strengthen the falso prosecution case. It is incorrect to suggest that I 
have made a dishonest improvement just to establish my presence at the 
time of occurrence at the place of occurrence. I got recorded in my 
statement under section 161, Cr.PC, Exh.DB that motive behind the 
occurrence was that Faisal accused stated that Abdul Razzaq deceased 
had murdered my father. Due to this grudge accused Faisal committed 
the murder of Abdul Razzaq deceased Confronted with Exh DB where 
it is not so recorded. got recorded in my statement under section 161, 
Cr.PC.. Exh DB that Faisal accused also got registered a criminal case 
regarding the murder of his father against Abdul Razzaq deceased at 
Police Station Kalyana, District Pakpattan. Confronted with Exh.DB 
whore it is not so recorded. I got recorded my statement regarding the 
conspiracy of the above said murder case under section 161, Gr.P.C. 
(At this stage, learned defence counsel requests that the copy of such 
statement was not delivered to accused under section 285-C. so the 
copy of said statement be provided for the purpose of confrontation. 
Learned DDPP for the state perused the police file and states that no 
such statement is available on record so it cannot be provided). It is 
incorrect to suggest that I have made a false statement regarding the 
statement of conspiracy before police.” 
 
By now it is well settled that witness who introduces dishonest improvement 
or omission for strengthening the case, cannot be relied; in this regard, case of 
“MUHAMMAD ARIF versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR 631) and  “KHALID 

Criminal Appeal No.66322-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.194/2019. 
11
MEHMOOD and another versus The STATE and others” (2021 SCMR 810) can 
be advantageously referred.  
Even otherwise, Allah Yar (PW-2) is not resident of place of 
occurrence rather his village “Thatha Baqarka, Dakhli Murdani” is at a 
distance of 12/13 k.m. from the place of occurrence; in this regard, relevant 
portion of statement of complainant/PW-1 is reproduced as under: - 
“Thatha Baqir Ka is situated at about 12/13 K.Ms from Basti 
Nooreki/place of occurrence.” 
 
So, he is a chance witness and though it was claimed by the complainant that 
he was residing at place of occurrence 7-months prior to the occurrence yet 
any plausible reason in this regard could not be brought on record; relevant 
portion of statement of Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (PW-12) in this regard is 
reproduced below: - 
“It is correct that at the time of recording the statement of Allah Yar 
son of Mohsin u/s 161 Cr.P.C. he had not stated before me that            
7 months prior to this occurrence he had shifted his residence from 
Thatha Bakara to Basti Nooraka.” 
 
 
Admittedly, Allah Yar (PW-2) is husband of Sheman Bibi daughter of 
complainant but she is not witness of the case; in this regard, relevant portion 
of statement of the complainant (PW-1) is hereby reproduced: - 
“It is correct that I did not cite Sheman Bibi as witness in this case.” 
 
Perusal of Medicolegal Examination Certificate (Ex.PK) of Abdul 
Razzaq does not contain name of complainant or any other cited eyewitness as 
attendants; even otherwise, if they were accompanying Abdul Razzaq in 
injured condition in the hospital, then why they did not tell name of accused 
and detail of the occurrence to Muhammad Yaqoob S.I. (PW-12); in this 
regard, relevant portion of statement of PW-12 is hereby reproduced: - 
“It is correct that at the time of preparation of Ex.PK/1 injury 
statement neither attendant of Abdul Razzaq injured narrated the name 
and number of the accused persons nor I mentioned the same in 
Ex.PK/1. It is correct that neither attendant of Abdul Razzaq deceased 
narrated before me the mode and manner of occurrence nor I 
mentioned the same in Ex.PK/1.” 
 
  
When all the aforementioned factors are taken into consideration in 
totality, then ocular account furnished by complainant/PW-1 and Allah Yar 
(PW-2) is neither confidence inspiring nor truthful; hence, same cannot be 
relied and is hereby discarded.  
So far as medical evidence is concerned, it is trite law that medical 
evidence is mere supportive/confirmatory type of evidence; it can tell about 

Criminal Appeal No.66322-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.194/2019. 
12
locale, nature, magnitude of injury and kind of weapon used for causing injury 
but it cannot tell about identity of the assailant who caused the injury; therefore, 
same is also of no help to the prosecution in peculiar facts and circumstances of 
the case, in this regard, case of “SAJJAN SOLANGI versus The STATE” 
(2019 SCMR 872) can be safely referred.  
 
As far as recovery of pistol (P-2) from Faisal (appellant) is concerned, 
suffice it to say that any crime-empty was not secured from the place of 
occurrence so it could not be established that said allegedly recovered pistol 
was used in the occurrence; report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, 
Lahore (Ex.PZ) is only to the extent of working capability i.e. “mechanical 
operating condition” of the pistol and in this regard, case of 
“MUHAMMAD ARIF versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR 631) can be 
advantageously referred wherein it has been held as under: - 
 
“Recovery of the weapons of offence along with live bullets 
allegedly effected at the instance of the appellant is not of much 
help to the prosecution because report of the Forensic Science 
Laboratory (Exh.PHH) is simply to the effect that rifle 222 bore 
was in working order.” 
 
therefore, said recovery is inconsequential and of no help to the prosecution.  
 
 
  
So far as motive is concerned, no motive was mentioned in the 
application (Ex.PA) as well as in the F.I.R. (Ex.PJ) but introduced through 
complaint (Ex.PB) at belated stage; however, it is relevant to mention here 
that it was claimed by the complainant in the complaint (Ex.PB) that father of 
Faisal was killed by Abdul Razzaq and Mujahid (now co-accused in this 
case/since P.O.); relevant portion of statement of the complainant (PW-1) in 
this regard is reproduced: - 
“It is correct that after the marriage my son Abdul Razzaq started 
reside at Chak No.14/G.B. alongwith accused Mujahid since P.O, 
and Faisal, The marriage remained intact at about one year. It is 
correct that after the above said marriage father of accused Mujahid 
since P.O. and Faisal was murdered Faisal accused become 
complainant of the above said murder case and got registered case 
F.I.R. 43/10 under section 302 P.P.C. against accused Mujahid since 
P.O. and deceased Abdul Razzaq, Accused Mujahid since P.O. and 
Abdul Razzaq deceased remained in judicial lock up with period of 
two years in the above said murder case. Thereafter a compromise 
had been effected and accused Mujahid since P.O. transferred his 
inherited land in the name of accused Faisal, complainant of said 
murder F.I.R. and his brothers and acquitted from the above said 
murder case. Witness volunteers that we also paid Diyat amount 
Rs.300.000/- to complainant party and thereafter my son Abdul 
Razzaq acquitted from said case.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis added) 
 

Criminal Appeal No.66322-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.194/2019. 
13
However, it has come on the record that said case was compromised and 
thereafter till now, no litigation took place between the parties; in this regard, 
relevant portion of statement of complainant (PW-1) is reproduced below: - 
“After the acquittal of the above mentioned murder case in 2012 we 
had no visiting terms with each other i.e. accused persons and the 
complainant party. It is correct that no litigation was pending prior 
to this occurrence between us.” 
Hence, on the one hand, when compromise in said case was effected and it is 
not the case of prosecution that same was broken, then it is weak and feeble 
motive and on the other hand, now what happened after compromise which 
compelled the appellant and his companions including Mujahid (now P.O.) to 
kill Abdul Razzaq i.e. immediate cause of the occurrence in the case, could 
not be proved; furthermore, motive cuts both the ways, it can also be a 
reason for false implication, even otherwise, when substantive evidence has 
been discarded, then motive becomes immaterial for conviction. Needless 
to add that as per statements of the complainant and cited eyewitness 
before the Court, in the area of place of occurrence, dacoity occurrence was 
used to be committed; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of the 
complainant (PW-1) is reproduced below: -  
“Docaity occurrence used to occur in the area of Ravi, our village 
which is situated in the area of Ravi.” 
Similarly, Allah Yar (PW-2) stated as under: - 
“The docaity occurrence often took place surrounding the place of 
occurrence.” 
Abdul Razzaq (deceased of the case) was also arrested in a dacoity case; in 
this regard, relevant portion of statement of the complainant (PW-1) is hereby 
reproduced: - 
“It is correct that police of Police Station City Renala Khurd 
apprehended my son Abdul Razzaq deceased alongwith his friend in 
dacoity case. Witness volunteers that friend of my son Abdul Razzaq 
deceased was arrested by the police and at that time my son was also 
with them that’s why he was also arrested by the police.” 
  
As far as abscondance of the appellant is concerned, suffice it to say 
that it has to be proved like any other fact, however, in this case, warrant of 
arrest (Ex.PR, available at Page No.200 of the paper book) reveals that it 
was not issued to any police officer or public servant for execution; 
similarly, it has not been mentioned in the proclamation  (Ex.PU, available 
at Page No.205 of the paper book) that in how much period or till which 

Criminal Appeal No.66322-J/2019 &   
Murder Reference No.194/2019. 
14
date, accused had to surrender; therefore, both warrant and proclamation are 
defective, mandatory requirements in the same have not been fulfilled and 
prosecution could not prove this limb of its case. It is important to mention 
here that abscondance is not proof of the charge; in this regard, guidance has 
been sought from the cases of “WAJEEH-UL-HASSAN versus The STATE” 
(2019 SCMR 1994) and “KHALID MEHMOOD alias KHALOO versus The 
STATE”(2022 S C M R 1148); furthermore, when ocular account has been 
disbelieved, then abscondance is of no help to the case of prosecution. 
Reliance is placed on the case of “ROHTAS KHAN versus The STATE” 
(2010 SCMR 566). 
8. 
It is well established principle of law that single dent/circumstance in 
case of prosecution is sufficient for acquittal; in this regard, case of “ABDUL 
GHAFOOR versus The STATE” (supra) can be safely referred.  
9.  
Nutshell of the above discussion is that prosecution has been failed to 
prove its case against the appellant; therefore, there is no need to discuss 
defence version. 
10. 
In view of, what has been discussed above, Criminal Appeal              
No.66322-J/2019, filed by Faisal (appellant), is allowed; conviction recorded and 
sentence awarded to the appellant through impugned judgment dated: 28.06.2019 
is hereby set aside.  Appellant is acquitted of the charge, he shall be released 
from the jail forthwith, if not required in any other case. 
11. 
Resultantly, death sentence awarded to Faisal (appellant) is NOT 
CONFIRMED and Murder Reference (M. R. No.194 of 2019) is answered in 
NEGATIVE.
