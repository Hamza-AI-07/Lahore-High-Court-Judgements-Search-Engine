Mr. Muhammad Ishnaq Sahou, Advocate for the 
petitioner. 
Mr. Imran Abbas Sahi, Assistant Advocate General 
with Adnan, SI. 
Mr. 
Muhammad 
Ahsan 
Bhoon, 
Advocate 
for 
respondent No.11.   
 
          This writ petition assails order dated 11.06.2022 whereby 
case cancellation report submitted by the police in case FIR 
bearing No.386 dated 14.04.2021 registered under section 406 
PPC at Police Station Badami Bagh, Lahore, stood agreed by the 
learned Magistrate.  
 
2.   Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that case 
cancellation report was prepared on 26.05.2021 which was agreed 
by the learned Magistrate on 11.06.2022 but before that 
investigation stood changed on 22.07.2021, wherein accused was 
held guilty. Further states that even 3rd change of investigation on 
14.09.2021 contains a case diary No.33 dated 12.10.2021 
reflecting involvement of accused for commission of offence. 
Further states that accused being agent of complainant though was 
primarily responsible for offence under section 406-PPC but 
police had sought a legal opinion for applicability of section 409 
PPC which the District Public Prosecutor, Lahore furnished vide 
letter dated 16.02.2022. According to learned counsel for the 
petitioner, District Public Prosecutor instead of commenting upon 
applicability of section 409 PPC has exaggerated that after second 
change of investigation, no element of criminal breach of trust 
was surfaced rather matter between the parties was found of 
business transactions, which took place in Dubai and civil suits

are also pending before the civil Court, therefore, case was rightly 
recommended for cancellation. Such opinion of District Public 
Prosecutor was further assailed before Prosecutor General, Punjab 
who by his opinion declared the act of District Public Prosecutor 
without any legal justification. Now it was stance of learned 
counsel for the petitioner that it was incumbent upon the 
Magistrate to consider the opinion of Prosecutor General, Punjab 
before agreeing with the case cancellation report because it was a 
case attracting an offence under section 409-PPC.  
 
3.    On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent states that 
case cancellation report was prepared on 26.05.2021 because first 
investigator has recommended the case for cancellation but same 
could not be filed before the Magistrate due to frequent change of 
investigation and finally it was filed on 25.04.2022 because by 
then in all three investigations, result remained the same that no 
offence was committed. The claim of involvement of 
accused/respondent in commission of offence by virtue of case 
diary No.33 dated 12.10.2021 was responded by learned counsel 
for the respondent with the argument that it was only a 
preliminary impression which finally stood diluted at the end of 
investigation by exoneration of accused/respondent. Such fact was 
conceded by learned Assistant Advocate General in attendance 
after perusal of police file. According to him, learned Magistrate 
in the impugned order has discussed all such facts including those 
spurred out even during 2nd & 3rd investigation while agreeing 
with the police report which does not call for any interference.  
 
4.    Heard. Record perused. 
 
5.    It is prerogative of Investigating Officer to recommend the 
case for cancellation on any of the grounds mentioned in Rule 
24.7 of Police Rules 1934 i.e., case false and frivolous owing to 
mistake of law or mistake of facts, matter of civil dispute, or non-
cognizable case. Case cancellation Report is identified in law as 
“final report” as per Rule 25.57 of Polic Rules 1934 and is 
regarded as report under section 173 of Cr.P.C. As per section 9 

                    Writ Petition No. 36921 of 2022

(4) of the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service (Constitution, 
Function and Powers) Act, 2006 (the CPS Act 2006), such report 
shall be sent through Prosecutor; it is as under; 
 (4)  A police report under section 173 of the Code including a 
report of cancellation of the first information report or a request for 
discharge of a suspect or an accused shall be submitted to a Court 
through the Prosecutor appointed under this Act. 
 
Concerned Prosecutor after scrutiny of such report or request shall 
file it before the Court and also submit his case review as per 
section 9 (7) of the CPS Act 2006; which is referred as under;  
(7) The Prosecutor shall submit, in writing, to the Magistrate or the 
Court, the result of his assessment as to the available evidence and 
applicability of offences against all or any of the accused as per 
facts and circumstances of the case and the Magistrate or the Court 
shall give due consideration to such submission. 
 
As per Code of Conduct for prosecutors issued under section 17 
of Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions 
and Powers) Act 2006, concerned prosecutor is required to apply 
evidential and public interest tests on report submitted under 
section 173 Cr.P.C. in order to evaluate the evidence and 
applicability of offences against the accused. As highlighted 
above case cancellation report is a report under section 173 
Cr.P.C., therefore, such tests shall also be applied on it, but only 
when if the prosecutor does not concur with the police opinion so 
as to recommend the Court that sufficient material is available to 
proceed with the case. However, if the prosecutor is in agreement 
with case cancellation report, he is not obliged to apply evidential 
test or the public interest test because case assessment report is 
written to show the availability of evidence and applicability of 
offence against any or all the accused.  
 
6.     Similarly, while agreeing with the police opinion, Magistrate 
functions in administrative capacity and is not expected to give 
reasons for such agreement as mentioned in Rule 2, Chapter 11-D 
Volume-III of High Court Rules & Orders which is reproduced as 
under; 
2. Duty of Magistrate to satisfy himself before passing order. - 
When a Magistrate agrees with a Police report that the F.I.R./case 
should be cancelled, he acts in an administrative and not in a 
judicial capacity and the order he makes is not a judicial order. 

                    Writ Petition No. 36921 of 2022

Such an order is not a revisable order and, therefore, the Magistrate 
is not required to give reasons for his order. 
 
but in this case, learned Magistrate after considering all the facts 
and circumstances passed the order which is perfectly in 
accordance with second para of Rule-2 above which is referred as 
under; 
“Though, Magistrates should exercise this discretion freely in 
making such order after satisfying themselves as to the grounds on 
which it is sought to be made, yet they should not treat the matter 
as one of ordinary routine.” 
 
Contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that opinion of 
Prosecutor General, Punjab should have been considered, by the 
Magistrate cannot be honoured in the sense that such opinion of 
Prosecutor General, Punjab is not binding on the Court because it 
is an opinion in his administrative capacity and not as concerned 
Prosecutor under section 9 (7) of the CPS Act 2006.  
 
7.     It is the official duty of Prosecutor General, Punjab to give 
legal opinion on criminal matters to any of the department of the 
government as mentioned in Government of the Punjab Rules of 
Business 2011. Rule 3 deals with allocation of business and as per 
sub-rule (3) the business of the Government shall be distributed 
amongst several Departments in the manner indicated in the 
Second Schedule which outlined the functions of Public 
Prosecution Department as under; 
 
              PUBLIC PROSECUTION DEPARTMENT 
  
1. Legislation, policy formulation and planning for Public 
Prosecution Service. 
  
2. [Monitoring and evaluation] of the working and the service 
delivery of Public Prosecution service.  
 
3. Advice to other administrative departments as a regulatory 
function for implementation of policy, on the subject, in: 
  
(a) Cases of criminal proceedings against government or 
any civil servant for an act or omission in his official 
duty, and  
 
(b) Cases relating to criminal litigation.  
 
 
3a. Consultation by other administrative departments in framing 
legislative and administrative policies relating to the collection 
of evidence, prosecution or sentencing.

3b. Legal aid in criminal matters.]  
 
4.   [* * * * * * * * * * * * ] 
 
5. Grant of sanction for filing appeals against acquittals/petitions 
for enhancement of sentence/Writ Petitions in criminal misc. 
matters/petitions for cancellation of bails and criminal petitions 
for leave to appeal in the appellate courts.  
 
6. Engagement of private prosecutor and determination of his 
fees, in rare and special criminal cases where no suitable 
departmental prosecutor is available.  
 
7. Budget, accounts and audit matters.  
 
8. Purchase of stores and capital goods for the department.  
 
9. Service matters except those entrusted to Services and General 
Administration Department. 
 
10. Administration of the „Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service 
(Constitution, Functions and Powers) Act, 2006‟ and the rules 
framed thereunder. 
  
11. Matters incidental and ancillary to the above subjects.  
 
12. Training, research and mentoring for Professional development 
of Public Prosecutors. 
 
Para-3 above indicates that Public Prosecution Department shall 
advice to other administrative departments as a regulatory 
function for implementation of policy, on the subject, in cases 
relating to criminal litigation and Prosecutor General being head 
of service as per section 6 of the CPS Act 2006 as principal law 
officer is responsible to give such opinion on criminal matters on 
behalf of Public Prosecution Department. Thus, rendering an 
opinion by Prosecutor General is his regulatory function which 
opinion is not binding on any Court; however, pursuant to section 
9 (7) of the CPS Act 2006 when any Prosecutor including 
Prosecutor General, Punjab submit his opinion in the form of 
assessment report to the Court concerned while applying the 
evidential and public interest tests, then as per section 9 (7) of the 
CPS Act 2006, the Magistrate or the Court shall give due 
consideration to such submission. 
 
8.   The words “due consideration to such submission” have 
strong connotation that Court cannot simply ignore it rather while 
disagreeing with such opinion, shall give the reasons. Thus, an 
administrative opinion or opinion in official capacity does not 
bind the Court to give reasons for disagreement rather it is

regulated by the discretion of Court to consider or not to consider 
it; and in this case the Magistrate has thought it appropriate not to 
consider it which cannot be termed as an illegality. Order dated 
11.06.2022 passed by learned Magistrate by all four corners is 
perfect which does not call for any interference by this Court. 
Even otherwise, petitioner has not been non-suited rather has an 
alternate efficacious remedy as held by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in case reported as “BAHADUR AND ANOTHER Vs 
THE STATE AND ANOTHER” (PLD 1985 Supreme Court 62) 
that a Magistrate who has agreed with the case cancellation report, 
can also entertain a private complaint on the similar facts. 
 
9. Resultantly, titled petition fails and the same is, therefore, 
dismissed.
