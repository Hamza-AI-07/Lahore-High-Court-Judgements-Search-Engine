Advocate.

Respondents No.3 by

ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. In this Constitutional Petition, 
the petitioners have challenged the order dated 25.01.2023 
(impugned order) passed by respondent No.2, whereby 
petitioners’ posting against the post of „Executive Engineer‟ 
(XEN) on their Own Pay and Scale (OPS) was set-aside. 
2. 
Relevant facts are that petitioners were appointed as 
„Sub-Engineer‟ in Housing Urban Development and Public 
Health Engineering Department of Government of Punjab 
(Department), subsequently, they were promoted to the rank of 
Sub Divisional Officer (SDO) (BS-17) on regular position. The 
petitioners No.1 & 2 were transferred and posted as XEN 
against OPS vide orders dated 02.12.2022 & 31.10.2022, 
respectively. The respondent No.3 alongwith other SDOs in the 
Department filed Writ Petition No.78612/2022 challenging the 
said posting of the petitioners mainly on the ground that under 

Writ Petition No.6917/2023                                                                    -2-  
 
 
 
 
the Punjab Health Engineering Department Service Rules, 1975 
(Rules), only an engineer duly registered with Pakistan 
Engineering Council (PEC) can be appointed against the post 
of XEN, therefore, petitioners’ appointment is hit by relevant 
Rules and the law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in 
“MAULA BUX SHAIKH and others Vs. CHIEF MINISTER 
SINDH and others” (2018 SCMR 2098). This Court, vide 
order dated 12.12.2022, without touching merits referred the 
matter to respondent No.2 to treat it as an application on behalf 
of the said SDOs and decide the same after hearing all 
concerned. The respondent No.2, after hearing all concerned, 
vide impugned order held that under the Rules no officer / 
person can perform professional engineering work, who does 
not possess accredited engineering qualification from the 
accredited engineering institution and his name is not registered 
as a registered engineer or professional engineer with PEC 
under the Pakistan Engineering Council Act, 1976 (PEC Act). 
Consequently, the appointment orders of the petitioners (who 
are B.Tech (Hons.) degree or Diploma degree holders) working 
as XEN on OPS, were withdrawn / cancelled. The petitioners 
being aggrieved have filed this Constitutional Petition. 
3. 
Learned counsel for respondent No.3 appeared at the 
limine stage and raised preliminary objections to the 
maintainability of this petition on the ground that admittedly the 

Writ Petition No.6917/2023                                                                    -3-  
 
 
 
 
petitioners are Civil Servants and the impugned order for 
cancellation of their posting and transfer orders/appointment 
orders relates to the terms and conditions of their service, 
therefore, this Constitutional Petition is not maintainable. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners, on the other hand, 
submits that petitioners were appointed against OPS and 
therefore, such order does not fall within the terms and 
conditions of their service, defined under Chapter-II of the 
Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974 (Act). He placed reliance on 
“REGIONAL COMMISSIONER INCOME TAX, NORTHERN 
REGION, ISLAMABAD and another Vs. SYED MUNAWAR ALI 
and others” (2016 SCMR 859). He further submits that not 
only the impugned order has been passed in pursuance to this 
Court’s direction but respondent No.2 has also misconstrued the 
law settled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Maula Bux case 
supra, therefore, this Constitutional Petition is the only remedy 
available with the petitioners. 
5. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the parties on 
threshold question of maintainability of this Constitutional 
Petition. There is no dispute that the petitioners are Civil 
Servants and performing their duties as such with the 
Department. The moot legal question of maintainability is that 
whether this Court has jurisdiction in the instant matter or 
whether petitioners‟ appointment orders on OPS basis will fall 

Writ Petition No.6917/2023                                                                    -4-  
 
 
 
 
within the terms and conditions of their service for invoking the 
jurisdiction of Punjab Service Tribunal (PST). In this context, 
perusal of the orders dated 02.12.2022 and 31.10.2022 shows 
that the petitioners were “transferred” and “posted” as XEN 
(OPS). These orders, on face of it, are transfer and posting 
orders of the petitioners and mere fact that petitioners were 
“transferred” and “posted” against OPS will not change the 
nature or status of their posting and transfer orders and exclude 
it from the terms and conditions of the service of the 
petitioners, including Section 9, Chapter-II of the Act where 
posting and transfer is one of the terms and conditions of 
service.  
6. 
No specific provision in law or rules referred to, which 
prescribes or permits appointment on OPS basis. However, the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court in “PROVINCE OF SINDH and others 
Vs. GHULAM FAREED and others” (2014 SCMR 1189) while 
dealing with OPS posting not only discouraged such practice 
but also noted that in exigencies the Government makes such 
appointments as a stop gap arrangement. The relevant part of 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s judgment is reproduced 
hereunder:- 
“11. We have inquired from the learned 
Additional Advocate-General to show us any 
provision of law and or rule under which a 
Civil Servant can be appointed on higher 
grade/post on OPS basis. He concedes that 

Writ Petition No.6917/2023                                                                    -5-  
 
 
 
 
there is no specific provision in the law or 
rule which permits appointment on OPS 
basis. He, however, submitted that in 
exigencies the Government makes such 
appointments as a stop gap arrangement. We 
have examined the provisions of Sindh Civil 
Servants 
Act 
and 
the 
Rules 
framed 
thereunder. We do not find any provision 
which could authorize the Government or 
Competent Authority to appointment any 
officer on higher grade on "Own Pay And 
Scale Basis". Appointment of the nature that, 
too of a junior officer causes heart burning 
of the senior officers within the cadre and or 
department. This practice of appointment on 
OPS basis to a higher grade has always been 
discouraged by this Court, as it does not 
have any sanction of law, besides it impinges 
the self-respect and dignity of the Civil 
Servants who are forced to work under their 
rapidly and unduly appointed fellow officers 
junior to them. Discretion of the nature if 
allowed to be vested in the Competent 
Authority will offend valuable rights of the 
meritorious Civil Servants besides blocks 
promotions of the deserving officers.” 
 
The same view was also followed by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court in “KHAN MUHAMMAD Vs. CHIEF SECRETARY, 
GOVERNMENT OF BALOCHISTAN QUETTA and others” 
(2018 SCMR 1411), where is held as under:- 
“The impugned notification stipulates that 
the petitioner and respondent No.3 were 
posted/transferred in their “own pay and 
scale”. In the case of Province of Sindh v. 
Ghulam Fareed (above) it was held, that 
posting/transferring a civil servant on his 
own pay and scale (OPS) is not legally 

Writ Petition No.6917/2023                                                                    -6-  
 
 
 
 
permissible.” 
 
7. 
It is also relevant to note that the judgment of Hon’ble 
Supreme Court in “PROVINCE OF SINDH and others Vs. 
GHULAM FAREED and others” supra was against the 
judgment passed by PST and in said judgment, the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court did not hold that PST has no jurisdiction in 
matters regarding appointment and transfer against OPS. 
Similarly, in respect of transfer against OPS, the service appeals 
were adjudicated by learned PST and matters went up to 
Hon’ble Supreme Court in judgments reported as “Sh. AMAR 
MAFTOON Vs. GOVERNMENT OF THE PUNJAB through 
Secretary Education and another” (1992 SCMR 1869), 
“CHIEF SECRETARY, GOVERNMENT OF N.W.F.P. and 
others Vs. Syed ZAFARMAND ALI” (2005 SCMR 1212) and 
“Mst. SAJIDA JAVED Vs. DIRECTOR OF SECONDARY 
EDUCATION, LAHORE DIVISION and others” (2007 PLC 
(C.S.) 364) and in none of these judgments, the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court held that in matter of appointments/transfers 
against OPS the jurisdiction of Service Tribunal is excluded. 
8. 
From the above discussion, there is no manner of doubt 
that transfer / appointment orders dated 02.12.2022 and 
31.10.2022 of the petitioners despite being OPS are for all 
intent and purpose are transfer and posting orders and therefore, 
fall within the terms and conditions of their service, prescribed 

Writ Petition No.6917/2023                                                                    -7-  
 
 
 
 
under Chapter-II of the Act. The judgment of the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court, reported as “REGIONAL COMMISSIONER 
INCOME TAX, NORTHERN REGION, ISLAMABAD and 
another Vs. SYED MUNAWAR ALI and others” (2016 SCMR 
859) and relied upon by the petitioners, is not applicable to the 
instant case. In the said judgment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
held that up-gradation is different from promotion and being 
granted through policy is not covered in the terms and 
conditions of the service of Civil Servants. However, in the 
present case there is no specific policy notified by the 
Government for OPS rather it is only followed as stop gap 
arrangement in the transfer and posting matters, hence, cannot 
be equated with up-gradation.  
9. 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court in various judgments 
repeatedly held that in respect of transfer and posting matters, 
the exclusive jurisdiction is of the PST and jurisdiction of this 
Court is barred under Article 212 of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (Constitution). In this regard, 
reliance 
is 
placed 
on 
“Miss 
RUKHSANA 
IJAZ 
Vs. 
SECRETARY, EDUCATION, PUNJAB and others” (1997 
SCMR 167), where it was held as under:- 
“2. We have heard the learned counsel for 
the 
parties. 
Both 
the 
petitioner 
and 
respondent No. 1 are admittedly civil
servants. Dispute between them relates to 
their transfer/posting which is a matter

Writ Petition No.6917/2023                                                                    -8-  
 
 
 
 
relatable to the terms and conditions of their 
service. Disputes about these matters fall 
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
Service Tribunal and the jurisdiction of the 
High Court is excluded in such matters by 
virtue of the express provisions of Article 
212(2) of the Constitution. It appears that the 
learned Judge in the High Court has not duly
attended to this aspect of the matter before 
issuing the stay order. In the circumstances, 
we convert this petition into an appeal and 
allow it. The impugned stay order is set aside 
and it is directed that the High Court should
first decide the question of its jurisdiction 
before passing any stay order.” 
In “ASADULLAH RASHID Vs. Haji MUHAMMAD MUNEER 
and others” (1998 SCMR 2129), the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
held as under:- 
“In that decision, Full Bench judgment of 
the Sindh High Court in the case of Khalil-
ur-Rehman v. Government of Pakistan 
(PLD 1981 Karachi 750) was also approved 
where it was held that orders, even if mala 
fide, ultra vires or coram non judice, fell 
within the ambit of Service Tribunal and 
jurisdiction of Civil Court including High 
Court was ipso facto ousted as a result of 
barring provisions of Article 212 of the 
Constitution. Reference in the decision of 
this Court dated 27-5-1998 in Civil Petition 
No.727-L of 1998 was also made to Zahid 
Akhtar (PLD 1995 SC 530) and it was 
observed as follows:  
"Against his transfer, the petitioner 
Zahid Akhtar had filed a writ petition 
in the Lahore High Court, which was 
dismissed as not maintainable in view 
of the bar contained in Article 212. 
Petitioner filed a petition for leave. In 
its decision, this Court referred to 
various principles and also the 

Writ Petition No.6917/2023                                                                    -9-  
 
 
 
 
Government Transfer Policy to be 
followed, but ultimately the petition 
for leave was dismissed as not 
maintainable. ” 
 
The same view was also expressed by Hon’ble August Court in 
“FEDERATION 
OF 
PAKISTAN 
through 
Secretary 
Establishment, Islamabad Vs. M. Y. LABIB-UR-REHMAN and 
others” (2021 SCMR 1554) in following terms:- 
“The High Court without indulging into the 
question of maintainability passed the order 
in cyclostyle fashion while assuming the 
jurisdiction which is not vested in it. This 
Court in the recent judgment dated 
21.05.2021 titled as Khalilullah Kakar v, 
PPO Balocitistan passed in Civil Appeal 
No.909/2020 etc has candidly held that 
Article 212 of the Constitution specifically 
places an embargo on all other courts 
except the Service Tribunal to assume 
jurisdiction. It is now established that any 
relating to terms and conditions of service is 
within the domain of administrative courts 
and tribunals established under Article 212 
and even if the element of mala fides, ultra 
vices or coram non judice is pressed into, 
the same can be entertained and decided by 
the said courts in its jurisdiction. There is 
no denial to this fact that the bare reading 
of the said Article is of significant 
importance especially with reference to its 
exclusive jurisdiction to entertain matters 
relating to terms and conditions of service. 
Hence, in all eventualities any petition 
relating to terms and conditions of service is 
to be dealt with by administrative courts 
and tribunals specifically established for its 
adjudication in pursuance of Article 212 of 
the Constitution. As a general principle, the 

Writ Petition No.6917/2023                                                                    -10-  
 
 
 
 
framers of the Constitution while inserting 
the 
said 
provision 
have 
ousted 
the 
jurisdiction of other courts including the 
High Court under Article 199 of the 
Constitution. ” 
 
10. 
There is no cavil that PST has no jurisdiction on the 
question of “fitness”, however, the question of eligibility is 
different from the question of fitness. The eligibility primarily 
relates to the terms and conditions of service and their 
applicability to the Civil Servants concerned, and therefore, the 
PST has jurisdiction on the question of eligibility, whereas the 
question of fitness is a subjective evaluation on the basis of 
objective criteria, where substitution for an opinion of the 
competent authority is not possible by that of a Tribunal, 
therefore, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction on the question of 
fitness. This general rule has been enumerated by the August 
Supreme Court in “MUHAMMAD ANIS and others Vs. ABDUL 
HASEEB and others” (PLD 1994 Supreme Court 539). In the 
present case, perusal of the impugned order shows that 
petitioners’ transfer/posting orders were cancelled on the 
ground that they, being B.Tech (Hons.)/Diploma degree holders 
and not accredited engineers registered with PEC, were not 
eligible for the post of XEN (OPS) in view of the Rules and 
Section 27 of the PEC Act. There is no question of fitness 
rather only the question of eligibility is involved in this petition, 
therefore, notwithstanding the fact that representation was 

Writ Petition No.6917/2023                                                                    -11-  
 
 
 
 
decided in pursuance to direction of this Court, even on this 
score this Constitutional Petition is not maintainable. In this 
regard, 
reliance 
is 
placed on 
“CHIEF 
SECRETARY, 
GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB, LAHORE and others Vs. Ms. 
SHAMIM USMAN” (2021 SCMR 1390). 
11. 
In view of the above discussion, the petitioners could not 
cross the threshold question of maintainability of this Writ 
Petition, therefore, without touching its merits lest it may 
prejudice case of any of the parties, the instant petition is 
dismissed being not maintainable.
