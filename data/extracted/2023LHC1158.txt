AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J. Through this single 
judgment I intend to decide above captioned Civil Revision as well 
as Civil Revision No.791 of 2012 titled as “Ghulam Mustafa V. 
Irshad Bibi, etc” as parties in both the petitions as well as subject 
matter is same and both civil revisions are arising out of same 
judgments & decrees of Courts below.   
2. 
Facts in brevity are that petitioner/plaintiff Mst. Irshad Bibi 
(hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) instituted a suit for declaration 
on 31.10.2007 against the respondent No.1 & respondents No.2-9, 
10-A to 10-F/defendants (hereinafter referred to as the respondents) by 
contending therein that she is owner in possession of suit property 
measuring 96 Kanals & 08 Marlas and impugned sale mutation 
No.110 dated 15.09.1988 as well as subsequent entries in the revenue 
record made on the basis of said mutation are against the facts & law, 
void ab-intio and infective upon her rights; that she never appointed 
Muhammad Aslam as her general attorney for sale of her property 
and the proceedings conducted by him are forged, fictitious and 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
2
based upon fraud; that she cancelled the general power of attorney 
being a forged document; that at the time of sanctioning of impugned 
mutation she was in Dar-ul-Aman, therefore, she did not appear 
before anyone; that neither she gave any statement nor received any 
consideration amount for sale of suit property; that all the 
proceedings with regard to sanctioning of impugned mutation are 
forged, fictitious, based upon fraud and result of collusiveness of 
revenue officials; that at the time of sanctioning of mutation 
Muhammad Aslam was shown to be her general attorney but she 
never appointed him as general attorney for the sale of suit property 
and if any such deed of attorney was shown to be executed, it is 
forged and fictitious and not applicable upon her, therefore, she is 
not bound to it; that impugned mutation was not attested by 
concerned Lumbardar; that impugned mutation was got sanctioned 
by Muhammad Aslam in favour of  respondents by misusing power 
of attorney, which is against law & facts and liable to be set aside as 
neither general attorney can alienate the property of his principal to 
his legal heirs nor can alienate without her consent to any other; that 
impugned mutation is without consideration and result of 
impersonation; that petitioner neither appeared before any Revenue 
Officer or Patwari nor got recorded her statement; that petitioner is a 
Pardanasheen lady and according to the custom she did not use to go 
outside her house without the consent of her husband; that 
respondents had been giving share produce regularly to her at her 
house, so, she remained unaware about the impugned sale; that one 
week ago when respondents started claiming themselves owner of 
the suit property and also stopped to give share produce, then it came 
to her knowledge that suit property had been alienated in their favour; 
that respondents were asked time & again to get cancel the impugned 
mutation but they refused to do so, which constrained her to institute 
the suit.  
3. 
On the other hand, respondent No.1 and respondents No.2 to 9 
& 10-A to 10-F/defendants contested the suit by filing their separate 
written statements in contrast whereby they raised certain legal as 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
3
well as factual objections such as petitioner has no cause of action; 
that suit is not maintainable in its present form; that they are         
bona-fide purchasers with consideration; that petitioner made sale 
bargain of the suit property through her general attorney namely 
Muhammad Aslam with respondents (defendants No.1 to 3 & 
predecessor of defendants No.4 to 10-F) and through mutation 
No.110 alienated the suit property to them; that after sale of the suit 
property, petitioner while admitting said power of attorney got it 
cancelled, therefore, she is estopped from her own words & conduct 
to institute the suit; that the suit is barred by time. While replying on 
facts, they pleaded that petitioner made sale bargain of land 
measuring 48 Kanals & 08 Marlas for a consideration of 
Rs.3,75,000/- with respondent No.1/defendant No.1 through her 
general attorney Muhammad Aslam (her real brother) and received 
Rs.3,75,000/- in presence of witnesses and similarly received 
Rs.3,75,000/- from defendants No.2 & 3 and predecessor of 
defendants No.4 to 10; that before attestation of the mutation power 
of attorney was got verified; that general attorney paid the 
consideration amount to the petitioner; that petitioner through her 
general attorney appeared before concerned Patwari and Revenue 
Officer and the general attorney got attested the suit mutation and 
prayed for dismissal of the suit.  
4. 
Owing to the divergent pleadings of the parties, learned Trial 
Court framed necessary issues and invited the parties to produce their 
respective evidence in support of their divergent stances. After 
recording evidence of the parties pro & contra, learned Trail Court 
dismissed the suit vide judgment & decree dated 03.05.2011. Feeling 
aggrieved, she preferred an appeal which was partially accepted vide 
judgment & decree dated 23.07.2012 and suit of the petitioner was 
decreed against respondent No.1 and oral sale mutation No.110 was 
cancelled to the extent of respondent No.1 regarding alienation of 
land measuring 48 Kanals 08 Marla, however, dismissed rest of her 
suit. Being dissatisfied, said Ghulam Mustafa has filed Civil 
Revision No.791 of 2012 for setting aside impugned judgment & 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
4
decree of appellate Court dated 23.07.2012, whereas, petitioner 
(Irshad Bibi) has filed Civil Revision No.970 of 2012 whereby she 
has prayed for decree of her suit in toto.  
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
perused the record with their able assistance.  
6. 
It evinces from the record that petitioner challenged the vires 
of mutation No.110 dated 15.09.1988 (Exh.P.1=Exh.D.1) which was 
entered on the basis of Rapat Roznamcha Waqiati No.366 dated 
31.08.1988 whereby her land measuring 96 Kanals & 08 Marlas was 
allegedly alienated through oral sale by her real brother/general 
attorney for a consideration of Rs.7,50,000/- to respondent No.1 
namely Ghulam Mustafa (real son of the general attorney) and 
Muhammad Anwar, Sadiq Ali & Hashmat Ali (vendees). Petitioner 
also challenged the authority of general attorney regarding sale of the 
suit property. Although, general power of attorney No.1949 dated 
21.12.1981 (original as Exh.D.2, certified copy as Exh.D2/1) was got 
cancelled by petitioner through revocation deed No.2586 dated 
19.09.1988 (Exh.D.4) but before its cancellation, said general 
attorney had alienated the suit property to respondents. Stance of the 
respondents is that they are bona-fide purchasers for consideration 
and purchased the suit property from petitioner through her general 
attorney. 
7. 
Suit property was sold by general attorney through oral sale 
mutation, therefore, in order to establish valid execution of the 
transaction, respondents have to prove not only the general power of 
attorney, the ingredients of sale but also the execution of the 
mutation through cogent and reliable evidence. In order to enforce a 
sale of immoveable property it was imperative for the vendees to 
establish that the transaction was undertaken with a title holder; there 
was an offer made which was accepted; the parties had no 
incapability; there was consensus at idem; that it was settled against 
valid consideration and that it was accompanied by the delivery of 
possession. Transaction involving property of illiterate women was 
to be treated at par with Pardanasheen lady and where a transaction 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
5
involved anything against her apparent interest, it must be 
established that independent, impartial and objective advice was 
available to her and the nature, scope, implication and ramifications 
of the transaction entering into was fully explained to her and she 
understood the same. Attestation of mutation by itself does not 
furnish proof of sale and whenever any such transaction was 
questioned, the onus laid on the beneficiary to prove the transaction 
and every ingredient thereof as well as the document if executed for 
its acknowledgment. Mutation was always sanctioned through 
summary proceedings and to keep the record updated and for 
collection of revenue, such entries were made in the relevant register 
under Section 42 of the Land Revenue Act, 1967 and it had no 
presumption of correctness prior to its incorporation in the record of 
rights. However, entries in the mutation were admissible in evidence 
but the same were required to be proved independently by the 
persons relying upon it through affirmative evidence. Oral 
transaction reflecting therein did not necessarily establish title in 
favour of the beneficiary. Mutation could not by itself be considered 
a document of title and may have been attested as an 
acknowledgment of past transaction.  
8. 
To reach a just conclusion, scanning of the whole evidence is 
necessary as conclusion drawn by both the Courts below are at 
variance. Guidance sought from the judgment of august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan whereby in a case titled “Mst. Azra Gulzar V. 
Muhammad Farooq and another (2022 SCMR 1625)” held as under: 
“In the case in hand, the fora below is at variance in their findings 
and in such like situation the High Court was supposed to give its 
findings after appraisal of the entire evidence.” 
9. 
Petitioner appeared in the witness box as P.W.1 and deposed 
that in lieu of her land situated at Noorpur Islambad, suit property 
was allotted to her in Chak No.7, Dunyapur which consisted upon 
100 Kanals. Now the suit property remained 96 Kanal & 08 Marlas 
as 04 Kanals came in the road. She further deposed that her brother 
Muhammad Aslam who is father of respondent No.1 (Ghulam 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
6
Mustafa) used to look after the suit property.  She maintained that 
property was being cultivated by the tenants and her brother used to 
give him share of produce in cash, sometimes to Rs.10,000/- 
annually and sometimes Rs.20,000/-. She also maintained that she 
did not give power of attorney to his brother with the mandate to sale 
the suit property rather the same was for the purpose to look after the 
suit property; after the death of her brother when she came on the 
suit property, then it came to her knowledge that the suit property 
had been sold. She deposed that mutation is based upon fraud as  
Muhammad 
Aslam 
general 
attorney 
neither 
obtained 
any 
advice/consent from her to sale the suit property nor paid her any 
consideration amount. She further stated that neither she gave any 
statement for sale of suit property nor put her thumb impression at 
any document. She also maintained that Muhammad Aslam wanted 
to marry her with his insane brother-in-law and when she refused to 
do so, he tortured her and she had life threats from him, therefore, 
she shifted to Dar-ul-Aman and due to that reason Aslam sold her 
land. She further deposed that she contracted second marriage with 
Raja Matloob. She deposed that respondents have no concern with 
the suit property. During cross-examination, she maintained that the 
power of attorney which was executed to look after the suit property 
was written with her consent. She admitted that she cancelled the 
power of attorney through revocation deed on 19.09.1988. She 
further deposed that 21/22 years ago she went to Dar-ul-Aman where 
she remained for 20/21 days and her second marriage was 
solemnized in Dar-ul-Aman. She also deposed that her brother 
Muhammad Aslam used to give her share amount by collecting the 
same from tenants. Despite lengthy cross-examination, respondents 
failed to bring anything favourable to them from the mouth of 
petitioner.  
 
Petitioner produced Malik Ghulam Mustafa as P.W.2 in 
support of her claim. He supported her version and deposed that he 
never heard that petitioner sold her land.  

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
7
 
In documentary evidence she produced copy of impugned 
mutation as Exh.P-1. Perusal of said document it appears that 
concerned Patwari incorporated factum of oral sale through Rappat 
Roznamcha Waqiati No.366 dated 31.08.1988. Through said 
mutation petitioner’s land measuring 96-kanals 08-marlas was 
transferred by her general attorney Muhammad Aslam in favour of 
Hashmat Ali (640 shares), Muhammad Anwar and Sadiq Ali (320 
shares) and Ghulam Mustafa (968 shares) for a consideration of 
Rs.7,50,000/-. Said mutation was witnessed by Muhammad Ibrahim 
s/o Nanik and Liaqat Ali s/o Jalal Din. Statements of the parties were 
recorded on 08.09.1988 whereas mutation was sanctioned on 
15.09.1988. Many cuttings were found on the said mutation. Copy of 
mutation No.111 dated 28.10.1988 was produced as Exh.P-2, 
whereby Muhammad Aslam general attorney of petitioner gifted his 
land measuring 100-kanals to his son namely Mujahid through oral 
Tamleek, copy of record of rights for the years 1986-87 as Exh.P-3, 
which shows ownership of petitioner upon the suit property, copy of 
record of rights for the years 2006-07 as Exh.P-4, copy of record of 
rights for the years 2006-07 as Exh.P-5. Perusal of said documents it 
appears that ownership with regard to suit property was changed and 
alleged vendees stepped into the shoes of petitioner. Copy of Khasra 
Girdawari for Kharif 2008 was brought on record as Exh.P-6.  
10. 
In rebuttal, defendant No.1 appeared as DW-1, defendant No.6 
as DW-2 and defendant No.2 as DW-3. They did not produce any 
independent witness in support of their stance. All the DWs deposed 
in the same line as narrated in their written statements. Respondent 
No.1 while appearing as D.W.1 deposed that general attorney 
Muhammad Aslam is his father who was appointed by petitioner as 
his attorney to look after the property and to sell the same. He 
maintained that attorney delivered the consideration amount of 
Rs.7,50,000/- to the petitioner and after getting the consideration 
amount she cancelled the power of attorney. During cross-
examination, he admitted that mutation was sanctioned in the office 
of Patwari and at that time petitioner was not present. He further 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
8
deposed that petitioner did not appear before any Officer. He 
admitted it correct that his Phuphi (petitioner) went to Dar-ul-Aman 
as she was angry with them; that she went to Dar-ul-Aman on 
09.08.1988 and came back on 29.08.1988. During cross-examination, 
he deposed that petitioner demanded her property as we were not 
marrying her as per her choice, thereafter, voluntarily said that she 
demanded amount after selling the suit property. He admitted that 
when petitioner contracted marriage with Raja Matloob, at that time 
she was in Dar-ul-Aman. He also admitted that her Phuphi 
(petitioner) is illiterate. He maintained that women in their family 
observed Parda. He also admitted it correct that share produce was 
given by his father to petitioner, however, voluntarily said that it was 
given before sanctioning of impugned mutation. He also admitted it 
correct that petitioner did not give any permission for sanctioning of 
impugned mutation, however, she got executed power of attorney.  
 
Defendant No.6 namely Bashir Ahmad appeared as D.W.2. 
During cross-examination, he deposed that petitioner is real sister of 
attorney Muhammad Aslam; he did not know when power of 
attorney was executed. He also admitted it correct that at the time of 
sanctioning of impugned mutation petitioner was not present and 
when the payment was made even then she was also not present. He 
also admitted it correct that petitioner did not receive any amount 
from him.  
 
Defendant No.2 Muhammad Anwar appeared as D.W.3 and 
deposed that consideration amount was paid to Muhammad Aslam 
general attorney. During cross-examination, he deposed that Irshad 
Bibi was consulted while purchasing the suit property and said 
consultation was made in his presence and in presence of Hashmat 
Ali. They did not depose anything about their source of income as 
well as never explained that how they collected consideration 
amount and paid to petitioner.  
 
Respondents produced copy of mutation No.110 as Exh.D-1, 
original general power of attorney as Exh.D-2, certificate issued by 
the Sub-Registrar as Exh.D-3, copy of deed of revocation as Exh.D-4,

11. 
Admittedly, petitioner remained in Dar-ul-Aman in the month 
of August, 1988. She moved an application for sending her in Dar-
ul-Aman on 09.08.1988 (Exh.D.6) whereby she maintained as under: 
"ہی ہک اسہلئ ون

وھجباےن اک مکح اصدر رفامرک اسہلئ وک ظفحت رفامہ ایک اجےئ"۔ 
She got recorded her statement before the Magistrate on 
09.08.1988 wherein she stated as under: 
 "ایبن ایک ہک ریمے اھبیئ اہلل داد اور دمحم املس ریمی اشدی ریمی رمیض ےک الخف رکان اچےتہ ںیہ۔ ھجم وک اےنپ اھبویئں ےس
"رطخہ ےہ۔ ںیم اینپ رمیض ےس داراالامن اجان اچیتہ وہں۔ 
 
Respondents produced attendance register of Dar-ul-Aman as 
Exh.D.7. In the said register, petitioner who was given number 36, it 
was written as under: 
"ومرہخ88

-
29وک اشدی ےک دعب ادارے ےس افرغ رکدای ایگ۔ اخودن ےک اسھت یئگ" 
 
Perusal of impugned mutation No.110, it appears that it was 
entered on 31.08.1988 and sanctioned on 15.09.1988. Petitioner was 
admitted in Dar-ul-Aman on 09.08.1988 and was released on 
29.08.1988 after her marriage with Raja Matloob. She left the house 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
10
of her brothers due to dispute of her marriage as well as threat of her 
life and property as they were bent upon to deprive her from the 
property. Admittedly, those days disputes between the principal and 
attorney were at peak. In view of that it does not appeal to a prudent 
mind in presence of such a strained relations petitioner was consulted 
and got her consent qua selling the suit property and she was given 
consideration amount.   
12. 
The suit property was alienated by general attorney on the 
basis of general power of attorney. It is settled principal of law that 
there must not be any uncertainty or vagueness in the power of 
attorney. Power of attorney should be construed strictly and only 
such powers qua the explicit object which were expressly and 
specifically mentioned in the power of attorney should be exercised 
by the agent as conceded to have been dedicated to him. The august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in its esteem judgment titled “FIDA 
MUHAMMAD versus Pir MUHAMMAD KHAN (DECEASED) 
THROUGH LEGAL HEIRS AND OTHERS” (PLD 1985 Supreme 
Court 341) held as under: - 
 
“It is wrong to assume that every "general" Power-of-Attorney on 
account of the said description means and includes the power to 
alienate/ dispose of property of the principal. In order to achieve that 
object it must contain a clear separate clause devoted to the said object 
The draftsman must pay particular attention to such a clause if intended 
to be included in the Power-of-Attorney with a view to avoid any 
uncertainty or vagueness. Implied authority to alienate property, would 
not be readily deducible from words spoken or written which do not 
clearly convey the principal's knowledge, intention and consent about the 
same. The Courts have to be vigilant particularly when the allegation by 
the principal is of fraud and or misrepresentation. 
 
The second aspect which needs caution on question of validity of acts 
under a Power-of-Attorney is that notwithstanding an authority to 
alienate principal's property, the Attorney is not absolved from his two 
essential obligations, amongst others firstly in cases of difficulty (and it 
will be a case of difficulty if the Power-of-Attorney is susceptible to 
doubt about its interpretation) to use all reasonable diligence in 
communicating with the principal and seeking to obtain his instructions, 
and secondly, if the agent deals on his own account with the property 
under agency, e.g., if he purchases it himself or for his own benefit, he in 
his own interest should obtain the consent of the principal in that behalf 
after acquainting him with all material circumstances on the subject, 
failing which the principal is at liberty to repudiate the transaction.” 
 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012.

In the light of above referred judgment, when power of 
attorney was examined, it appears that principal gave authority as 
under:

From perusal of said general power of attorney, it appears that 
it did not contain a clear separate clause with regard to 
alienation/sale of the suit property. It evinces from the said deed of 
power of attorney that it was made to complete the allotment process 
and to look after the suit property. Power to alienate/sale was given 
in a general and vague manner, meaning thereby although authority 
of alienation was given but not specifically with express terms and 
by necessary implication. It is evident from record that Muhammad 
Aslam got the property rights of suit property in favour of petitioner 
through registered conveyance deed dated 20.01.1982 (Exh.D.3) by 
using said General power of attorney. Said attorney used the general 
power of attorney after seven years of its execution for transferring 
petitioner’s property through impugned mutation without getting any 
fresh mandate from the principal.  

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012.

13. 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the power of 
attorney must be strictly construed while observing in a case titled as 
“MUHAMMAD AKHTAR versus Mst. MANNA and 3 others” (2001 
SCMR 1700) as under: - 
 
“It is well settled by now that the power of attorney must be strictly 
construed and it is necessary to show that on a fair construction of the 
whole instrument the authority in question may be found within the four 
corners of the instrument either in express terms or by necessary 
implication.” 
 
And endorsed said dictum in “MUHAMMAD YASIN and 
another versus DOST MUHAMMAD through Legal Heirs and 
another” (PLD 2002 SC 71) in following terms: - 
 
“It is also well known principle of law that all such instruments of power 
of attorney in pursuance whereof attorney is authorized to act on behalf 
of principal are to be construed strictly.” 
 
14. 
It is also evident from the perusal of said power of attorney 
that no authority for oral sale was given to the attorney. He was 
given only authority to execute registered sale deed as under:  
"ہعیب انہم وہقیث اجت ررٹسجی اہےئ ذبرہعی اکحم اجمز دصتقی و وظنمر رکاےئ" 
 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment 
reported as “IMAM DIN and 4 others versus BASHIR AHMED and 
10 others” (PLD 2005 SC 418) did not validate the oral sale on 
behalf of attorney despite the fact he was given authority to sell the 
property through registered sale deed and held that attorney was 
specifically authorized to sell the property through registered sale 
deed and in the light of strict construction of power of attorney, 
implied authority of oral sale could not be presumed and also 
observed as under: - 
 
“The power of attorney is a written authorization by virtue of which the 
principal assigns to a person as his agent and confers upon him the authority to 
perform specified acts on his behalf and thus primary purpose of instrument of 
this nature is to assign the authority of the principal to another person as his 
agent. The main object of such type of agency is that the agent has to act in the 
name of principal and the principal also purports to rectify all the acts and 
deeds of his agent done by him under the authority conferred through the 
instrument. In view of nature of authority, the power of attorney must be strictly 
construed and proved and further the object and scope of the power of attorney 
must be seen in the light of its recital to ascertain the manner of the exercise of 
the authority in relation to the terms and conditions specified in the instrument. 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
13
The rule of construction of such a document is that special powers contained 
therein followed by general words are to be construed as limited to what is 
necessary for the proper exercise of special powers and where the authority is 
given to do a particular act followed by general words, the authority is deemed 
to be restricted to what is necessary for the purpose of doing the particular act. 
The general words do not confer general power but are limited for the purpose 
for which the authority is given and are construed for enlarging the special 
powers necessary for that purpose and must be construed so as to include the 
purpose necessary for effective execution. This is settled rule that before an act 
purported to be done under the power of attorney is challenged as being in 
excess of the powers, it is necessary to show on fair construction, that the 
authority was not exercised within the four corners of the instrument”. 
 
It was further observed that: 
 “Even if a presumption of existence of the power of attorney is raised, the 
transaction would still be not considered genuine and within authority of agent 
for want of explicit power of oral sale. The attorney was specifically authorized 
to sell the property through registered sale-deed and in the light of strict rule of 
construction of power of attorney, the implied authority of oral sale could not be 
presumed. The attorney was not given general authorization for disposal of 
property in any manner rather his authority of sale was restricted by registered 
deed and consequently, his failure to act in the manner as provided in the 
document would render the transaction invalid”. 
It was further observed that: 
 
“The perusal of the attested copy of the power of attorney would show that 
various acts relating to the management of property, litigation and all other 
matters concerning the property, including the power of selling through 
registered sale-deed were mentioned therein in explicit terms and the attorney 
was bound to act strictly in the manner as specified in the power of attorney to 
ensure that the transaction was transparent and free of fraud and 
misrepresentation”. 
It was further observed that: 
 
“The property in respect of which the power of attorney was executed, was 
allotted to the vendor by the Rehabilitation Department and the powers given 
therein in the power of attorney were in respect of the litigation of property with 
the departments, including the power of filing of suits, written statements, 
appeals, revisions in the Civil Court. High Court and the Supreme Court, the 
management of property, the ejectment of tenant, receipt of produce and rent 
from the tenants to pursue litigation, civil and criminal to file affidavits and 
applications in the suits as well as in execution proceedings and let out property 
on lease. In addition, the attorney was also empowered to sell the property on 
receipt of the sale price through registered sale-deed and appoint the Advocate 
for his assistance. The perusal of this document would show that the power of 
sale of land was given to the attorney specifically by means of a registered 
sale-deed and probably the purpose of restricting the power of sale only by 
registered sale-deed was to avoid any misuse of the said power and to ensure 
that the sale was with the consent and knowledge of 'the principal, therefore, in 
the light of rule of strict construction of such instrument, it could be visualized 
that the oral sale was not within the authority of agent under the instrument”. 
 
15. 
Petitioner  specifically pleaded in her plaint that she executed 
power of attorney only to look after her property and did not give 
any authority for alienation/sale of the suit property. While appearing 
in the witness box, she reiterated her version. Admittedly, petitioner 
is an illiterate lady, who was unaware of the technicalities and 
worldly affairs. Muhammad Aslam, her real brother was in position 
of a fiduciary on whose advice she was relying. Now, it was duty of 
the beneficiaries to prove that petitioner had complete knowledge 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
14
and full understanding about the contents of the document and that 
she had independent and disinterested advice in the matter before 
entering into the execution of the document. Respondents have to 
prove that petitioner was made to understand that she was also giving 
power to sell the property to her attorney. Endorsement of Sub-
Registrar on the document showing that same had been read over to 
such lady was of routine nature and could not be construed therefrom 
that she had been specifically apprised that she was also giving 
power to her attorney to sell the property. Mere thumb marking a 
document would not tantamount to a valid execution, until & unless 
such lady was duly apprised and made to understand the true nature 
& contents thereof. In this case, neither scribe of the attorney deed 
nor its marginal witnesses were produced in order to establish that 
the document was duly made understandable to the petitioner and its 
contents were in her knowledge.  Respondents also failed to examine 
Sub-Registrar who registered the document. In this way, they 
withheld the material evidence and no effort whatsoever was made to 
produce the same in the Court.  
16. 
The execution of power of attorney neither amounts to be 
divesting the principal of the authority over the subject matter nor 
does it amount to absolute right of the attorney over the property as 
its owner. The attorney has to act as an agent of the principal. There 
is a restriction that the attorney has to take the principal in 
confidence before converting the property of the principal on the 
force of the power of attorney into personal use or for the benefit of 
his near relatives. Admittedly, suit property was transferred by the 
general attorney to his son namely Ghulam Mustafa i.e. respondent 
No.1. If an attorney intends to exercise right of sale in his favour or 
in favour of next of his kin, he has to consult the principal before 
exercising that right and he should firstly obtain the consent and 
approval of the principal after acquainting her with all the material 
circumstances. In this regard, august Supreme Court of Pakistan in a 
case titled “Muhammad Ashraf & 02 others V. Muhammad Malik & 
02 others (PLD 2008 SC 389)” held as under:  

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
15
“It is a settled law by now that if an attorney intends to exercise right of 
sale/gift in his favour or in favour of next of his kin, he/she had to consult 
the principal before exercising that right. The consistent view of this 
Court is that if an attorney on the basis of power of attorney, even if 
"general" purchases the property for himself or for his own benefit, he 
should firstly obtain the consent and approval of principal after 
acquainting him with all the material circumstances. Here in the cases of 
Fida Muhammad v. Pir Muhammad Khan (deceased) through legal heirs 
and others PLD 1985 SC 341, Mst. Shumal Begum v. Mst. Gulzar Begum 
and 3 others 1994 SCMR 818 and Nisar Ahmad and others v. Naveed-
ud-Din and others 2004 SCMR 619, can be referred, which are fully 
applicable to the case in hand.” 
 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled “Haq 
Nawaz & others V. Banaras  & others (2022 SCMR 1068)” held as 
under: 
“It was not even pleaded that she received any independent advice 
and/or that contents of the power of attorney were read over and 
explained to her before she executed it. 
…. it was imperative for the appellants Nos.1 and 2 to have 
demonstrated and proved that at the time of the execution of the 
power of attorney, she was fully conscious of the fact that the 
document also contained power to sell and that the entire document 
was read out and explained to her fully and truly, and further that she 
executed it under an independent advice. They had also to prove that 
the lady was fully aware and conscious of the consequences and 
implications of executing the said document. However neither did 
they prove, nor even pleaded any of it. It therefore cannot be held that 
Ghulam Rasool, was in fact authorized by Mst. Channan Jan to sell 
the suit land. The impugned sale/transfer was thus liable to be set-
aside on this ground alone. In any view of the matter, since admittedly, 
the power of attorney did not specifically authorized Ghulam Rasool, 
to convey the property to his sons, or for that matter to any of his 
near ones, nor has he been able to prove that, he was otherwise so 
authorized. The impugned sale mutation was liable to be cancelled as 
rightly done by the revenue hierarchy. Since long it is well 
established that an attorney cannot lawfully make transfer of a 
property under agency in his own name, or for his benefit, or in 
favour of his associates, without explicit consent of the principal, and 
in the event he does so, the principal, under the mandate of section 
215 of the Contract Act, has a right to repudiate such transaction. 
Mst. Channan Jan having disowned the subject transaction, the same 
was rightly annulled as noted above.” 
 
It was also held by apex Court of Pakistan in case “Mst. 
Shehnaz Akhtar & another V. Syed Ehsan-ur-Rehman & others 
(2022 SCMR 1398): 
“It is a settled law by now that if an attorney intends to exercise right 
of sale/gift in his favour or in favour of next of his kin, he/she had to 
consult the principal before exercising that right. The Court further 
held that the consistent view of this Court is that if an attorney on the 
basis of power of attorney, even if "general", purchases the property 
for himself or for his own benefit, he should firstly obtain the consent 
and approval of principal after acquainting him with all the material 
circumstances and also referred to the dictums laid down in the case 
of Fida Muhammad v. Pir Muhammad Khan (deceased) through legal 
heirs and others (PLD 1985 SC 341), Mst. Shumal Begum v. Mst. 
Gulzar Begum and 3 others (1994 SCMR 818) and Nisar Ahmad and 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
16
others v. Naveed-ud-Din and others (2004 SCMR 619).” 
17. 
Suit property was transferred through oral sale mutation 
No.110. Respondents also failed to prove valid execution of said oral 
sale mutation. Neither concerned Patwari who entered the mutation 
nor Revenue Officer who attested the mutation as well as witnesses 
in whose presence statements of the parties were recorded had been 
produced. They also failed to produce any proof regarding their 
death as no death certificates of these persons were brought on 
record. Article 80 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 provides the 
procedure how to prove when no attesting witness is found. It is 
obligatory upon the respondents to prove this fact that their witnesses 
had been died or cannot be traced out. In this regard, the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in “Ghulam Sarwar (Deceased) Through 
L.RS., and others versus. Ghulam Sakina” (2019 SCMR 567) held as 
under: -  
“Mere assertion that marginal witnesses of the mutations had died would 
not discharge the burden of a party. There is nothing to establish the 
death of said witnesses.” The petitioner failed to lead any evidence to 
establish death or disappearance of the said witnesses.”  
 
It was further held by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
case “MUHAMMAD SARWAR versus. MUMTAZ BIBI and others” 
(2020 SCMR 276) as under:-  
“It is also noticeable that the concerned Tehsildar who had allegedly 
sanctioned the mutation namely Rehmat Ali and another witness of the 
mutation namely Anwar Hussain (Patidar) were material witnesses of 
the alleged gift mutation. They were however not produced for any valid 
reason. Therefore, the presumption of Article 129 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order by reason of withholding of the best evidence can also 
be drawn against the petitioner.”  
 
In another case titled “Sheikh Muhammad Munir V. Mst. 
Feezan (PLD 2021 SC 538) held as under: 
“The Article states that it must be proved that the witness had either died 
or could not be found. Simply alleging that a witness cannot be found did 
not assuage the burden to locate and produce him. The petitioner did not 
lead evidence either to establish his death or disappearance, let alone 
seek permission to lead secondary evidence.”  
 
  
The respondents had a way to prove the factum of death by 
leading secondary evidence but they failed to do so. In this way, best 
evidence was withheld without showing any justification, thus 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
17
inference of Article 129(g) of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 has 
to be drawn against him. They also remained failed to comply with 
the requirements of Article 17 & 79 of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 
1984. 
18. 
Admittedly, there are numerous cuttings on the alleged oral 
sale mutation. The said cuttings which have been made on the 
mutation were sufficient to declare the impugned sale null & void. 
Reliance is placed upon the case law cited as “Mst Hameedan Bibi & 
another V. Muhammad Sharif (2017 YLR 239).” 
19. 
Respondents failed to prove the sale which constituted basis of 
the mutation or even the mutation itself. Neither they established on 
record that they had source of income to generate such a huge 
amount of Rs.7,50,000/- in the year 1988 nor established through 
concrete and trustworthy evidence that said consideration amount 
was transferred to the principal. Neither any independent witness was 
produced in this regard nor they tendered any receipt with regard to 
payment of consideration amount.  
20. 
General attorney namely Muhammad Aslam transferred the 
suit property through impugned mutation No.110 dated 15.09.1988 
by using power of attorney dated 21.12.1981. Petitioner cancelled the 
said general power of attorney just after four days of sanctioning of 
the mutation through revocation deed dated 19.09.1988. After 
sanctioning of impugned mutation, deed of general power of attorney 
became useless. If transaction of sale was in her knowledge, then 
definitely she did not revoke the general power of attorney as it lost 
its importance after alienation of suit property.  
21. 
Through written statement, respondents took a legal objection 
that suit of the petitioner is barred by limitation. Learned Trial Court 
framed issue No.5 in this regard which was decided by the Trial 
Court against the respondents. Respondents did not prefer any cross-
objections while challenging said findings. However while arguing 
their case before learned lower appellate court, the respondents 
agitated the point of limitation. The learned appellate court repelled 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
18
their contention. Respondents No.2 to 9 and 10-A to 10-F did not file 
any cross-revision before this Court.  
Record reflects that petitioner instituted the suit on 31.10.2007 
whereby she took the stance that she came to know about the 
impugned transaction one week before institution of the suit. 
Petitioner has specifically alleged that the impugned transaction is 
result of fraud & mis-representation.  
22.  
It is well settled principle of law that fraud vitiates even the 
most solemn transaction. Any transaction based on fraud would be 
void. Limitation does not run against void transaction. Mere efflux of 
time did not extinguish the right of any party. Notwithstanding the 
bar of limitation, the matter can be considered on merit so as not to 
allow fraud to perpetuate. In this regard, I seek guideline from the 
cases of Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as “PEER 
BAKHSH through LRs and others vs. Mst. KHANZADI and others” 
(2016 SCMR 1417);“Muhammad Iqbal versus Mukhtar Ahmad” 
(2008 SCMR 855)“Mst. Raj Bibi etc. versus Province of Punjab, 
etc.” (2001 SCMR 1591) and “Hakim Khan versus Nazeer Ahmad 
Lughmani” (1992 SCMR 1832).  
  
With regard to point of limitation, the august Supreme Court 
of Pakistan in case titled as “KHAN MUHAMMAD through L.Rs and 
others versus Mst. KHATOON BIBI and others” (2017 SCMR 1476) 
held as under:-  
“As far as the question of limitation in filing suit for declaration is 
concerned, we also would like to discuss it in some detail. In general, the 
time provided for such suit under Article 120 of the Limitation Act, 1908 
is six years. Different aspects regarding reckoning/calculating this 
period of limitation have been considered and some yardsticks have been 
settled by this Court in different nature of cases and the situation 
cropping-up according to the facts and circumstances of the cases. In the 
cases of simple correction of revenue record, it is settled by now that 
every fresh wrong entry in the record of rights would provide fresh cause 
of action provided the party aggrieved is in possession of the property as 
owner needless to say that it can be either physical or symbolic 
possession. Similarly, in the cases of claiming right of inheritance, it is 
well settled that the claimant becomes co-owner/co-sharer of the 
property left by the predecessor along with others the moment the 
predecessor dies and entry of mutations of inheritance is only meant for 
updating the revenue record and for fiscal purposes. If a person feels 
himself aggrieved of such entries, he can file a suit for declaration within 
six years of such wrong entries or knowledge. Any such repetition of the 
said entries in the revenue record would again give him a fresh cause of 
action or when the rights of anyone in the property are denied it would 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
19
also give fresh cause of action. Similarly, it is again. settled by now that 
no limitation would run against the co-sharer. We for instance can quote 
few judgments covering all these aspects like “Ghulam Ali and 2 others 
v. Mst.Ghulam Samar Naqvi” (PLD 1990 SC 1), “Riaz Ahmad and 2 
others v. Additional District Judge and 2 others” (1999 SCMR 1328), 
“Mst. Suban v. Allah Ditta and others” (2007 SCMR 635), “Muhammad 
Anwar and 2 others v. Khuda Yar and 25 others” (2008 SCMR 905) and 
“Mahmood Shah v. Syed Khalid Hussain Shah and others” (2015SCMR 
869).” 
 
August Supreme Court of Pakistan in judgment “Muhammad 
Yaqoob V. Mst. Sardaran Bibi & others” (PLD 2020 SC 338), held 
as under:  
“In addition, any transaction/document which is the result of fraud of 
misrepresentation can neither be perpetuated nor can it be protected on 
the ground of expiry of the period of limitation, whenever such 
transaction is assailed in a Court of law.”  
 
Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1908 is the most pivotal 
provision providing relief in computing the limitation period, 
applicable to a person who claims to be deprived of the knowledge 
of his right to sue based on the fraud of the other party. That section 
is reproduced for ease of reference: 
“18. Effect of fraud. Where any person having a right to institute a suit 
or make an application has, by means of fraud, been kept from the 
knowledge of such right or of the title on which it is founded, or where 
any document necessary to establish such right has been fraudulently 
concealed from him, the time limited for instituting a suit or making an 
application--- 
(a) against the person guilty of the fraud or accessory thereto, or 
(b) against any person claiming through him otherwise than in good faith 
and for a valuable consideration, 
shall be computed from the time when the fraud first became known to the 
person injuriously affected thereby, or, in the case of the concealed 
document, when he first had the means of producing it or compelling its 
production.” 
 
Where a person is by means of fraud kept from the knowledge 
of his right to institute a suit. In such circumstances, the period of 
limitation commences from the date when the fraud first became 
known to the "person injuriously affected". Such injuriously affected 
person can, therefore, institute a suit within the limitation period 
specified for such suit in the First Schedule ("Schedule") to the 
Limitation Act, but computing it from the date when he first had 
knowledge of the fraud, whereby he was kept from knowledge of his 
right to institute the suit. Thus, section 18 of Limitation Act is an 
umbrella provision that makes the limitation period mentioned in the 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
20
Articles of the Schedule, begin to run from the time different from 
that specified therein. 
 
Therefore, it is the date of knowledge of the "person 
injuriously affected" of the fraud mentioned in section 18, and of his 
right to sue that is relevant for computing the limitation period.  
 
Thus, the limitation period of six years provided in Article 
120 of the Limitation Act is to be computed from the time 
mentioned in the said Article, that is, when the right to sue accrued. 
It reads: 
 
Description of suit. 
Period 
of 
limitation. 
Time 
from 
which 
period begins to run. 
120. Suit for which no 
period of limitation is 
provided elsewhere in 
this schedule. 
Six years. 
When the right to sue 
accrues. 
 
The provision clearly declares that for computing the 
limitation, the period of six years would commence from the date of 
accrual of right to sue. To ascertain, when does the right to sue 
accrue, to seek a declaration of her ownership right over the suit 
property shown to have been transferred to see another provision of 
law, that is, section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. A suit for 
declaration of any right, as to any property is filed under section 42 
of the Specific Relief Act, which reads: 
“42. Discretion of Court as to declaration of status or right--- Any 
person entitled to any legal character, or to any right as to any property, 
may institute a suit against any person denying, or interested to deny, his 
title to such character or right, and the Court may in its discretion make 
therein a declaration that he is so entitled, and the plaintiff need not in 
such suit ask for any further relief. 
Provided that no Court shall make any such declaration where the 
plaintiff, being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title, 
omits to do so.” 
 
It becomes evident by reading the above provisions that the 
right to sue accrues to a person against the other for declaration of 
his right, as to any property, when the latter denies or is interested to 
deny his such right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in its 
recent judgment titled “RABIA GULA and others Vs. MUHAMMAD 
JANAN and others” (2022 SCMR 1009) while interpreting two 

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
21
actions that cause the accrual of right to sue, to an aggrieved person: 
(i) actual denial of his right or (ii) apprehended or threatened denial 
of his right, held as under:- 
“8.13 Now, what "actions" can be termed as an "actual denial of right", 
and what a mere "apprehended or threatened denial of right", in the 
context of adverse entries recorded in the revenue record. It is important 
to note that a person may ignore an "apprehended or threatened denial" 
of his right taking it not too serious to dispel that by seeking a 
declaration of his right through instituting a suit, and may exercise his 
option to institute the suit, when he feels it necessary to do so, to protect 
his right. For this reason, every "apprehended or threatened denial" of 
right gives a fresh cause of action and right to sue to the person 
aggrieved of such apprehension or threat. However, this option to delay 
the filing of the suit is not available to him in case of "actual denial" of 
his right; where if he does not challenge the action of actual denial of his 
right, despite having knowledge thereof, by seeking declaration of his 
right within the limitation period provided in the Limitation Act, then his 
right to do so becomes barred by law of limitation. 
 
Petitioner specifically pleaded in her plaint that respondents 
used to pay share produce to her at her home. While recording her 
statement she deposed that suit property was cultivated by the 
tenants and her brother collected the share produce from them and 
then paid to her. After the death of her brother they stopped to pay 
the share produce. She also clarified that after death of her brother 
when she visited the suit property then it came to her knowledge that 
the suit property had already been sold by her brother to the 
respondents by using the general power of attorney. Respondent 
No.1 while recording his statement as DW-1 during cross-
examination admitted that it is correct his father used to pay the 
share produce of the suit property to the petitioner. However he 
voluntarily said that his father gave to suit produce before 
sanctioning of the mutation. From the above it can easily be gathered 
that Muhammad Aslam had been giving share produce to the 
petitioner and after his death when respondents stopped to pay the 
share produce, alienation of suit property came to her knowledge and 
she promptly instituted the suit to safeguard her interest.  
23. 
In the light of above discussion, suit of the petitioner was within 
the limitation, hence, learned Courts below have rightly decided issued 
No.5 qua limitation against the respondents and in favour of petitioner. I 
also endorse the findings of Courts below on this particular  issue.  

C.R. No. 970-D & 791-D of 2012. 
22
24. 
I have minutely gone through the record available on the file, 
evidence of the parties as well as the impugned judgments and decrees 
passed by the learned courts below. Learned Trial Court has erred in 
law while dismissing suit of the petitioner, whereas, learned Appellate 
Court has also not properly appreciated the evidence of the parties 
while partially allowing the appeal. The findings of the Courts below 
qua dismissing suit of the petitioner are merely based on surmises and 
conjectures, which is against facts and law, having not based upon 
proper appreciation of oral as well as documentary evidence. 
25. 
In the wake of above discussion, this Civil Revision is allowed. 
Consequently, the impugned judgments and decrees of the Courts 
below dated 03.05.2011 & 23.07.2012 are hereby set-aside to the extent 
of dismissal of petitioner’s suit. Resultantly, the suit instituted by the 
petitioner is decreed as prayed for. The connected Civil Revision 
No.791 of 2012 titled as “Ghulam Mustafa V. Irshad Bibi, etc.” is 
dismissed having no force. No order as to cost.
