AHMAD NADEEM ARSHAD, J.  Through 
this 
Civil 
Revision filed u/s 115 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, petitioner 
has called into question the vires, validity and legality of judgment 
dated 20.09.2023 whereby learned Appellate Court, while accepting 
the appeals of respondents, set-aside the judgment/order of learned 
Trial Court through which the auction was confirmed in favour of 
the petitioner and sale certificate was issued.  
2. 
Pithily, the facts forming background of proceedings in hand 
are that respondents No.4 to 8 instituted a suit for possession through 
partition against respondents No.1 to 3 qua four immoveable 
properties. The learned Trial Court, after observing due codal 
formalities, decreed the suit vide judgment & decree dated 
20.12.2021 and adjourned the proceedings for submission of mode of 
partition. Since the defendants were not in attendance, hence, the 
learned Trial Court observed that without their consent referee 
cannot be appointed and the property was put to internal auction by 

C.R. No. 72449 of 2023.  
2
fixing the reserve price vide order dated 07.02.2023. Due to absence 
of defendants, learned Trial Court declared internal auction to be 
failed and appointed Muhammad Aslam Khan, Advocate as Court 
Auctioneer with a direction to submit proposed schedule of open 
auction vide order dated 17.04.2023. Thereafter, the auction schedule 
was approved vide order dated 11.05.2023 and the case was 
adjourned for awaiting the report of Court auctioneer. In the 
meanwhile, order dated 17.04.2023 and 11.05.2023 were challenged 
by respondent No.1 through preferring an appeal. Said appeal was 
allowed vide order dated 12.06.2023 subject to depositing an amount 
of Rs.10 million before the Executing Court within a week and 
respondent No.1 was granted single opportunity to participate in the 
internal auction. Respondent No.1 failed to deposit the said amount 
within the stipulated time. As the learned Appellate Court had not 
suspended and set aside the order of open auction dated 11.05.2023, 
hence, the Court auctioneer conducted the auction proceedings and 
resultantly properties were auctioned on 15.06.2023 and 16.06.2023. 
In the said auction proceedings, petitioner participated and declared 
to be the highest bidder with regard to the commercial shop 
measuring 01 Marla bearing Khewat No.443, Khatuni No.448, 
Khasra No.287 situated at the Revenue Estate Chak No.51, Tehsil & 
District Mandi Bahauddin. On 26.06.2023, the Court Auctioneer 
submitted his report. On the said date, petitioner also submitted an 
application seeking permission to deposit remaining 80% amount in 
the Court. Learned Trial Court adjourned the proceedings for perusal 
of report and further appropriate order. Vide order dated 06.07.2023, 
auction in favour of the petitioner was confirmed subject to payment 
of entire remaining amount till 15.07.2023. Petitioner deposited the 
total sale consideration amount through Receipt dated 10.07.2023 
and through Challan Form on 12.07.2023. Learned Trial Court vide 
order dated 17.07.2023 directed to issue sale certificate in favour of 
the petitioner. After rejection of the objections raised on the auction 
proceedings, respondent No.1 challenged the orders dated 
26.06.2023 and 06.07.2023 through preferring an appeal. Learned 

C.R. No. 72449 of 2023.

Appellate Court disposed of the appeal in terms that the learned 
counsel for the parties shall inform the executing Court about their 
compromise and also deliver arguments on their objections and after 
hearing the purchaser of the property, learned Executing Court shall 
decide the same in accordance with the provisions of Section 11(5) 
and 11(10) of the Punjab Partition of Immoveable Property Act, 
2012. Consequently, the learned Trial Court vide order dated 
27.07.2023 dismissed the objections. Being dissatisfied, respondents 
No.4 to 8 as well as respondents No.1 to 3 preferred their separate 
appeals by challenging the orders of learned Trial Court dated 
06.07.2023, 17.07.2023 and 27.07.2023. Learned Appellate Court, 
while accepting the appeal of respondents No.4 to 8 set aside the 
auction proceedings dated 15.06.2023 and 16.06.2023, the orders of 
confirmation of sale and also cancelled the sale certificate issued in 
favour of the petitioner as well as other successful bidder namely 
Asif Sohail (respondent No.9) vide impugned order dated 20.09.2023. 
Respondent No.9 did not assail the said order, however, petitioner 
challenged said order through filing instant revision petition.    
3. 
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and 
perused the record with their able assistance.  
4. 
From the perusal of record, it has transpired that petitioner 
participated in an open auction held on 15.06.2023 and declared 
highest and successful bider of a commercial shop measuring One 
Marla by giving higher bid amounting to Rs.38,500,000/- the reserve 
price of which was Rs.23,878,100/-. Accordingly, he deposited the 
20% of his bid amount i.e. Rs.7,700,000/- (Rupees 100,000/- in cash 
and Rs.7,600,000/- through cheque). Learned Appellate Court set aside 
the auction on the ground that petitioner failed to deposit the 
remaining auction amount within the period of 07-days fixed by the 
law as well as on the grounds of other irregularities and illegalities 
committed during the auction proceedings.   
5. 
     Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner 
maintains that petitioner participated in the auction proceedings held 
on 15.06.2023 and he was declared to be the successful bidder who 

C.R. No. 72449 of 2023.  
4
deposited the 20% of the bid amount forthwith to the Court 
Auctioneer. Petitioner moved an application before the Court on 
26.06.2023 whereby he sought permission to deposit remaining bid 
amount. Said application was allowed by the Trial Court on 
06.07.2023 and he was directed to deposit the remaining bid amount 
before 15.07.2023. Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn 
attention of this Court towards the receipt/Transfer Pay In Slip dated 
10.07.2023 whereby an amount of Rs.38,400,000/- was deposited in 
the Government treasury account G-11215 and Challan Form No.32-
A whereby said amount was deposited in the Court on 12.07.2023. 
He argued that petitioner complied with the direction of the Court 
within the stipulated time, hence, he could not be penalized for the 
act of the Court.  
6. 
    In response to this, learned counsel for the respondents 
argued that petitioner was bound to abide by the law, where it has 
been provided that the successful bidder shall deposit the remaining 
80% amount within a period of 07-days. He referred to the “Auction 
Proclamation” (اشتہار نیالمِ عام) wherein at serial No.6 of the auction 
conditions it has been mentioned that the purchaser will deposit the 
remaining auction price of 80% in the Court within 15 days and in 
case of default the Court has jurisdiction to deduct the auction 
expenditures from the deposited 20% amount and put the property to 
re-auction in case the highest bid is lower than the earlier highest bid 
then that difference shall also be deducted. For ease, said clause is 
reproduced as under:- 
"

And argued that at the most the petitioner could take advantage of 
the “Auction Proclamation” wherein he was required to deposit the 
remaining amount within 15 days, to which he also failed.

7. 
      Before proceeding further, it is better to consider the 
provision of open auction as described in Section 11 of the Punjab 
Partition of Immoveable Property Act, 2012, which reads as under:/ 
11.    Open auction.– (1) If the co-owners refuse to participate in 
the internal auction or only one co-owner shows his willingness 
to participate in such auction or the internal auction under 
section 10 has failed, the Court shall fix the reserve price of the 
immovable property and direct open auction of the property. 
 (2)  A co-owner of the immovable property may participate in 
the open auction of the property. 
 (3)  The Court shall appoint a court auctioneer for conducting 
the open auction and fix fee of the court auctioneer to be paid by 
the co-owners in proportion to their respective shares in the 
immovable property. 
(4)  The court auctioneer shall submit in the Court an auction 
plan in the form of a public notice which shall include detailed 
specifications of the immovable property, the time, date and 
place of open auction, and the amount of bid security for 
participating in the open auction, and the Court may approve the 
auction plan with or without modification and direct its 
publication in such manner as it deems appropriate. 
(5)  The court auctioneer shall conduct open auction under the 
auction plan approved and published by the Court and direct 
the highest bidder to deposit– 
 (a)  earnest money equal to twenty per cent of the bid price 
immediately on the close of bidding; and 
b)  the remaining amount of the bid price in the court within 
seven days. 
 (6)  The court auctioneer shall maintain the record of the 
auction proceedings and return the bid security to unsuccessful 
bidders but shall adjust the bid security of the highest bidder in 
the bid price. 
 (7)  The court auctioneer may, in an appropriate case, accept 
deposit under clause (a) of subsection (5) in the form of cash, 
crossed cheque, demand draft or banker’s cheque against a 
receipt. 
 (8)  The court auctioneer shall, immediately after conclusion the 
auction, deposit in the Court the auction price collected by him 
along with the auction report. 
 (9)  If the highest bidder deposits the auction price under 
subsection (5), the Court shall confirm the sale, put the highest 
bidder in possession of the property and distribute the auction 
price amongst the co-owners according to their respective shares. 
 (10)   If the highest bidder fails to deposit the auction price 
under subsection (5), the amount deposited by him shall stand 
forfeited and the immovable property shall be put to open 

C.R. No. 72449 of 2023.

auction again, as far as possible, in accordance with the 
procedure contained in this section. 
 
8. 
    From the perusal of section 11 (5) of the Act ibid, it emerges 
that the highest bidder is bound to immediately deposit the 20% of 
his bid amount and the remaining amount is to be deposited within 
07-days. The sub-clause 10 of Section 11, provides the consequence 
of non-compliance of the former provision, wherein the legislature 
has provided that if the highest bidder fails to deposit auction price 
under sub-Section 05, the amount deposited by him shall stand 
forfeited and the immoveable property shall be put to re-auction.  
9. 
     The provision with regard to payment of 80% of the 
balance purchased money contained under sub-section (5) of Section 
11 of the Act ibid is mandatory in nature and not merely directory 
and that non compliance thereof renders a sale void and the court is 
under obligation in such circumstances to order for resale of the 
property in terms of Section 11(10) of the Act ibid. Non payment of 
balance 80% of the purchase money cannot be described as an 
irregularity in connection with the “publication and conducting of the 
sale” so as to attract the provisions of Order XXI, Rule 19 CPC. The 
fact of non compliance of Section 11(5) of the Act ibid on auction 
sale is that the sale is rendered void and there is no sale within the 
contemplation of said section. In the event of a default the previous 
proceedings for sale would completely wiped out as if they do not 
exist in the eye of law. The Court had no power either under Section 
148 or Section 151 CPC to extend the time fixed for payment of the 
balance money of sale price. The maxim that act of the court 
prejudice no man apply on to those cases where it is shown in the 
first place that the party, who acted bonafidely on the order of Court 
was in no way responsible for passing of that order and secondly the 
party was in a position to meet his obligation under law but non 
compliance resulted due to orders of the Court. The Court was not 
possessed any power to enlarge the time fixed under this Section ibid. 
The Hon’ble Supreme Court while discussing consequences of non 
deposit of ¾ auction money by purchaser within 15-days as provided 

C.R. No. 72449 of 2023.  
7
under Order XXI, Rules 85 and 86 of CPC in a case titled Mst.Nadia 
Malik Versus Messrs Makki Chemical Industries Pvt Limited through Chief 
Executive and others (2011 SCMR 1675) observed as under:- 
“12.  The next question before this Court is whether the executing 
Court while following the provisions of Order XXI, Rules 84 and 85 
CPC, was competent to extend time before 15 days for deposit of 
balance 75% of the amount of the auction money. The answer in this 
behalf would be in negative. The time for deposit of amount is 
provided under Order XXI, Rule 85 C.P.C. Under Rule 85 an 
auction purchaser shall deposit6 25% of the auction amount 
immediately on being declared as highest bidder and the balance 
amount of 75% shall be deposited within 15 days of the auction. In 
the present case, the sale was confirmed on 29-04-2002 on which 
date the appellant had deposited 35% of the auction amount. In 
terms of Order XXI, Rule 85 C.P.C., the appellant was required to 
deposit the balance amount of Rs.6.00 million by 13-05-2002. 
Admittedly, this amount was not deposited by the said date and 
record reveals that an application for extension of time was made by 
the appellant on 13-5-2002 and on 14-05-2002 an amount of Rs.3.00 
million was deposited and for the balance amount of 3 million 
further time of 10 days was sought. The appellant as has already 
been observed earlier has deposited Rs.19,93,750 on 29-04-2002, 
which was 25% of the auction price whereas Rs.3.00 million was 
deposited on 14.5.2002 after a lapse of 15 days, the stipulated time, 
and the remaining 3.00 million on 23.5.2002. The default in deposit 
of the balance amount was violative of the mandatory conditions 
provided under the proclamation  which language was borrowed 
from the mandatory provisions of the Order XXI of the C.P.C. 
Failure to deposit the balance amount of 75% of auction money 
within 15 days by the appellant renders the sale/auction proceedings 
nullity . The language of Order XXI, Rules 84 and 85 C.P.C are 
mandatory in nature. If the balance amount of auction price is not 
paid within the stipulated period of 15 days, the court has the 
discretion to forfeit the deposit and order re-sale of the property. In 
addition to forfeiture, the defaulted purchaser forfeits all claims to 
the property. The conditions contained in the proclamation provide 
all such details. It has provided that a party who is declared as 
highest bidder, shall immediately deposit 25% of the sale price and 
remaining 75% of the sale price would be deposited within 15 days. 
Violation of these conditions would not empower the executing court 
to extend time for deposit of balance amount unilaterally.” 
 
10. 
   The legislature has not necessitated the permission of the 
Court to deposit the remaining consideration amount. Petitioner was 
bound to deposit the remaining 80% amount within 07-days after the 
auction to which he failed. Hence, non-compliance of said 
mandatory provision entails the penal consequences.  
11.        There is no force in the arguments of learned counsel for the 
petitioner that the petitioner deposited the remaining 80% amount 
within the period stipulated by the Court. In this regard, suffice is to 
say that no Court can deviate from the mandatory provision of law. 

C.R. No. 72449 of 2023.  
8
The act of the Court derives force from the statute and when the 
statute has not provided any leniency in this regard then how the 
Court could give any relaxation. The Division Bench of this Court in 
its reported judgment titled as Messrs Maqi Chemicals Industries (Pvt.) 
Limited through Chief Executive and 3 others Versus Habib Bank Limited 
through Manager and 2 others (2003 CLD 571) observed as under:- 
“14.   The arguments of learned counsel for respondent No.3, 
that because the Court had enlarged the time on 14.5.2002 and 
if the application had been refused in terms of Rule 85, the 
purchaser would have made arrangement to make the deposit 
and thus in the above situation, the purchaser on account of act 
of the Court, cannot be  prejudiced. 
We are afraid, this argument has no substance, because every 
person is required to know the law. Thus respondent No.3, 
should have known that full payment has to be made within 15 
days and her application by itself was absolutely unfounded and 
misconceived, it was an abortive attempt to circumvent the 
provision of Rule 85. The rule that no one shall be prejudice on 
account of an act of the Court, would only be applicable in 
those cases, where the court has the authority to pass the order 
but the order is erroneous, however, where the court lack the 
authority and absolutely has no jurisdiction, notwithstanding 
such order having  been passed by the court, a person cannot 
take premium of such void order on the principle mentioned 
above.”  
 
12. 
In view of the above, learned Appellate Court has rightly 
allowed the appeals of the respondents. Learned counsel            
appearing on behalf of the petitioner remained unable to point out 
any illegality, irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the impugned 
judgment. Impugned judgment has been passed in accordance with 
law after due appreciation of the law on the subject, which do not 
call for any interference by this Court while exercising revisional  
jurisdiction.   
13. 
For what has been discussed above, the instant Civil Revision 
is without any merits, hence, the same is hereby dismissed with no 
order as to costs.
