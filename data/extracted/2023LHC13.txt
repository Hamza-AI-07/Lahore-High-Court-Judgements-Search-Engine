went to the Bank branch on 14.01.2020 to operate her locker and 
found her gold jewellery weighing 16.50 Tolas missing from the 
locker whereupon she accordingly informed the Bank authority 
(Manager) in this regard. She filed an application/ complaint on the 
same day i.e. 14.01.2020 before the Manger of the petitioner-bank 
regarding missing of her gold jewellery but her complaint was 
declined by the petitioner-bank.  
 
Respondent No.3 filed a complaint under Section 82-D of the 
Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 read with Section 9 of the 
Federal Ombudsman Institutional Reforms Act, 2013 and the 
Banking Mohtasib, Pakistan turned down the said complaint vide 
order dated 29.01.2021. Feeling aggrieved with the above said 
order, respondent No.3 filed a representation before the Worthy 
President of Pakistan who accepted the same vide order dated 
28.10.2021 directing the petitioner-bank to compensate respondent 
No.3 /complainant forthwith as per instructions of the State Bank of 
Pakistan. Hence, this writ petition.  
3. 
I have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsels 
for the parties at full length and gone through the entire record with 
their able assistance.  
4. 
The learned Banking Mohtasib entertained a complaint of 
respondent No.3 under Section 82-D of the Banking Companies 
Ordinance, 1962 read with Section 9 of the Federal Ombudsman 
Institutional Reforms Act, 2013 but failed to discharge his duty as 
per Sections 82-A, 82-B, 82-D, 82-E and 82-F of the Banking

Companies Ordinance, 1962, as the complainant who is a doctor by 
profession filed her an affidavit alongwith the complaint regarding 
loss of gold ornaments from the locker, whereas neither any 
departmental inquiry was held nor any counter affidavit was filed 
by the petitioner-bank to controvert her solemn deposition. It is 
settled law that in absence of any counter-affidavit the contents of 
the sworn affidavit are deemed to be admitted. Reliance is placed 
on a case titled as Abida Parveen Vs. District Education Officer, 
Schools Elementary (Female) Mirpur & 4 Others (2014 PLC (C.S) 
999) wherein it has been held as under:- 
“8….It is a settled principle of law that when some 
fact is alleged and supported by an affidavit, if, there 
is no rebuttal from the other side by filing counter 
affidavit, the same shall be deemed admitted…..” 
Reliance is placed on the case title Muhammad Nawaz Vs Mohsin 
Saleem (2016 MLD 1553) wherein, this Court held as under:- 
“5…….It is well established that any application 
supported by an affidavit, if not controverted by filing 
counter affidavit along with the written reply should 
be taken as correct statement of fact.” 
In a case titled as Iyaz-ul-Haq Chaudhary Vs Nib Bank Limited 
through Authorized Attorney & 4 Others (2016 CLD 1741), a 
learned Division Bench of this Court held as under:- 
“6……Even otherwise, respondent No.1 has neither 
filed any reply to application under section 24 of the 
Financial 
Institutions 
(Recovery 
of 
Finances) 
Ordinance, 2001 read with section 5 of the Limitation 
Act, 1908 (C.M.No.1/C/2015) nor counter affidavit to 
controvert the narration of facts and the grounds 
raised in this application, which means an admission 
on the part of respondent No.1……” 
Reliance is also placed on the case cited as Muhammad Bachal Vs. 
IXTH Additional District Judge, Hyderabad & Another (2019 CLC 
Note 51) wherein it is held as under:- 

Writ Petition No.77994/2021

“17…..and that the Affidavit of the applicant has not 
been controverted by the respondent / plaintiff by 
filing counter affidavit, which amounts to admission 
of the averments made in the affidavit application.” 
Reliance is also placed on the cases cited as President of Pakistan 
through Chairman, P.W.R., Lahore Vs Sarfraz Khan (1980 CLC 
541), Muhammad Farooq M. Memon Advocate Vs. Government of 
Sind through its Chief Secretary, Karachi (1986 CLC 1408), 
Messrs Holy Family Hospital through Administrator Vs. 
Government of Sindh & Another (2009 PLC (C.S) 824) & Quaid-
e-Azam Medical College, Bahawalpur through Principal Vs 
Muhammad Aslam & Another (2009 YLR 1508).  
5. 
The State Bank of Pakistan, the governing body of the 
banking sector of the country, issued Circular No.5 dated 5th June, 
2007 stating the SOPs for security of the lockers and as per clause 
2(v) of the said circular all the lockers shall be insured. For ready 
reference, Circular No.05/2007 is as under:- 
“MASTER CIRCULAR ON SECURITY STANDARDS 
FOR 
ENHANCEMENT 
OF 
SECURITY 
OF 
THE 
LOCKERS. 
Please refer to BPD Circular No. 27 read with BPD Circular 
Letter No. 48 of 2004 on the above subject. 
2. It has been brought to the knowledge of State Bank of 
Pakistan that some banks are reluctant to honour the claims 
with regard to vandalism of lockers by the security guards or 
by their employees. This is being attributed to a clause in 
their agreement with the insurance companies, which restrict 
them to honour such claims. This position has been 
reviewed and it has been decided to issue following 
instructions on the subject:- 
i) The banks/DFIs shall ensure that safe deposit 
locker rooms in their respective branches are 
adequately secured from all sides, and the security 
arrangements in place are fool-proof and meet the 

Writ Petition No.77994/2021 
5 
 
security standards developed by each bank / DFI. The 
banks/DFIs may review their existing security 
arrangements to outsource the same to a security 
agency enlisted on the approved panel of Pakistan 
Banks Association (PBA). The banks may decide at 
their own to obtain or otherwise, any undertaking 
from the head of the security company for recovery 
of losses incurred on breakage of lockers by the 
security guards. 
ii) In case the bank branches are providing safe 
deposit locker facility in areas where security agency 
on the PBA approved panel is not available, the 
bank/DFI shall carry out due diligence at the branch 
for the appointment of their own security guard(s). 
iii) The banks/DFIs shall review their existing 
insurance agreements and shall obtain comprehensive 
insurance with clear cut “Cap Limits” on various 
sizes of lockers at competitive rates from the 
insurance companies ready to cover the act of 
vandalism of lockers both by the security guards and 
employees of the banks/DFIs. 
iv) The banks/DFIs shall properly convey the terms 
& conditions (including size, rent/p.a, insurance 
ceiling etc) to the existing locker holders / new locker 
holders. Consent of all existing/new locker holders 
shall be obtained for the insurance ceiling etc. 
v) In case of breakage /damage to the locker by any 
means, the locker holder shall be compensated by the 
bank/DFI immediately as per the insurance ceiling of 
the locker. 
3. The banks/ DFIs are free to take further measures in 
addition to above for safety & security of lockers. 
4. Apart from strengthening security arrangements, the 
banks/DFIs should also bolster/reinforce their internal 
controls for smooth operation of lockers. 
5. This circular supersedes all previous instructions on the 
subject.” 
 
6. 
The relationship of a Bank and its customer is based on trust 
on the basis of which the respondent No.3 had put her valuable 
articles i.e. gold ornaments in the locker but it is noted with great 
concern that when the respondent No.3 informed the petitioner-
Bank about missing of her valuable articles from the locker, the 
petitioner-Bank instead of making its best efforts to redress her 

Writ Petition No.77994/2021 
6 
 
grievance, not only declined her application but also went one step 
further and contested her case before respondents No.1 & 2.  This 
conduct of the petitioner-Bank is not appreciable at all. The public 
opt to put their valuable articles in bank lockers for security 
purpose and if their articles are misplaced from there and the banks 
will not redress their grievance in such case of loss, the very 
foundation of the banking system would collapse. 
  
All the above material facts and law have not been 
considered by the Banking Mohtasib Pakistan while dismissing her 
complaint whereas respondent No.1 has rightly allowed the 
representation of the respondent No.3 and directed the petitioner-
bank to compensate respondent No.3/ complainant forthwith as per 
instruction of the State Bank of Pakistan contained in Circular No.5 
dated 5th June, 2007. 
7. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner has not been able to point 
out any illegality or material irregularity in the impugned order 
passed by the President of Pakistan and has also not identified any 
jurisdictional defect.  
8. 
In the wake of above discussion, this writ petition is 
dismissed being devoid of any merits. This Court while granting 
interim relief directed the petitioner-Bank to initiate the process of 
recovery of sum of insured amount of locker from the insurance 
company and upon receiving it, deposit the same in some profit 
bearing scheme and shall not disburse to respondent No.3 till 
decision of this lis. The petitioner-bank submitted report on 
08.11.2022 while stating therein that the insured amount of locker 

Writ Petition No.77994/2021 
7 
 
has been deposited in the account of respondent No.3. As instant 
writ petition is being dismissed, as such the amount lying in the 
account of respondent No.3 be released to her.
