18.05.2023.     Mr. Mudasar Naveed Chatha, Advocate for the 
petitioner. 
Mr. Imran Abbas Sahi, AAG. 
 
 
 
Through this constitution petition the petitioner has challenged the 
vires of Order No. DC/GA/535/CNF dated 11.05.2023 by Deputy 
Commissioner, Wazirabad/respondent No.2, hereinafter called as impugned 
order, by which Siddique (father of the petitioner) has been put under 
preventive detention. 
2. 
Report and para-wise comments were called for from Deputy 
Commissioner, Wazirabad/respondent but despite repeated directions the 
same have not been received, however, report/parawise comments have been 
submitted by the District Police Officer, Wazirabad which shows that the 
impugned detention order was passed on apprehension of the SHO. Relevant 
lines of the said report are reproduced hereunder:- 
“The SHO PS Ghakhar Mandi Wazirabad expressed his strong 
apprehension that Siddique (petitioner’s father) along with his companions 
would cause loss/damage to the public and private properties, which could 
result in breach of peace and law & order situation in the District and 
made request for detaining the said activist for 90 day under Maintenance 
of Public Order (MPO) 1960.” 
But the above report is not supported with any material showing any 
reasonable ground or identification of the detenu, busy in any activity 
prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of public order, in any of the 
documentary forms like SMS/Voice messages, WhatsApp Messages or of 
other social media accounts, Pamphlets/handouts, Posters, play cards, 
Photographs, 
Paintings, 
Caricatures, 
Books/Literature, 
Newspapers, 
Audio/Video CDs, Electronic and Digital material, Wall chalking,

Banners/Pena flex, recording of demonstrations in Rallies, Material on face 
book, twitter or any other social media account, call records, geo-fencing 
through CDR, Speeches in Public Meetings , Radio & T.V. shows, 
Surveillance report in any form, reports from international agencies, 
suspicious transaction report from any financial institution, membership 
record of affiliated association or political party etc.  
3. 
The learned counsel for the petitioner has regarded the impugned 
detention order as illegal and in support of his contention placed reliance on 
the cases reported as “THE GOVERNMENT OF EAST PAKISTAN versus 
MRS. ROWSHAN BIJAYA SHAUKAT ALI KHAN” (PLD 1966 Supreme 
Court 286) and “MUHAMMAD ABDAAL alias ABDALI versus 
GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB and others” (PLD 2020 Lahore 471). 
4. 
Arguments heard; record perused. 
5. 
The unrest in the country ensued on 9th May, 2023 after the arrest of a 
political leader which was flashed on media showing people came out for 
agitation and demonstrations and with no time it turned into unholy mob 
who committed mischief at different places in the country. Confused in the 
situation, the government has opened a front, showing no application of 
mind, driven by passionate wishes; directed or dictated but not sound and 
logical started dragging the ordinary citizens in criminal litigation with a 
ratio of one in 3 cases/proceedings minimum. Government has launched 
attack on the acclaimed miscreants at the time when there was no law-and-
order situation, a condition which necessitates for application of law relating 
to preventive detention. Government if tracks that any criminal activity was 
result of participation of some individuals, it has sufficient time to collect the 
material and book the individuals in criminal cases, so that one could know 
about the nature of allegations to properly defend and answer the charge 
which is the essence of due process and access to justice as enshrined in 
Article 10-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 
Not only the violation of section 144 Cr.P.C. is an offence u/s 188 of PPC 
but ‘Tempering with public servants’ and ‘Sabotage’ are also offences 
punishable u/ss 19 & 20 of Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960 
which caters to the situation and such offences are cognizable and non-

3 W.P.No.32441.23. 
 
bailable. Dumb driven actions offend the fundamental rights to life, liberty, 
and the most of all ‘the dignity’. It is observed that the Constitution framers 
have rated the dignity a bit at lower level comparing to right to life and 
liberty, that was the reason it is seriated as Article 14, five steps down from 
‘right to life and liberty’ (Article-9) but experience tells that if an individual 
has all the fundamental rights except right to dignity, he cannot enjoy other 
rights with pleasure. Life without dignity means, a clutched and wish less 
creature living on borrowed crumbs. Is that what for Allah has created the 
human being to lead the world as His vicegerent? What dignity speaks in the 
words of Constitution is reproduced as under; 
Inviolability of dignity of man, etc. 
14. (1)  
The dignity of man and, subject to law, the privacy of 
home, shall be inviolable. 
(2) 
No person shall be subjected to torture for the purpose 
of extracting evidence. 
 
The word “inviolable” has been used in the Constitution only in Article 5 
(Loyalty to State) and Article 14 (Dignity of man etc.) which has a strong 
connotation showing importance and value in the context as to why only for 
Loyalty to State, Dignity of man and Privacy of home this term has been 
used. The word ‘inviolable’ in the context of dignity has been interpreted by 
the Supreme Court, “a right that is not subject to any qualification, 
restriction or regulation”. The case reported as “UZMA NAVEED 
CHAUDHARY and others Versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN and 
others” (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 783) throws light as under:- 
14. 
It is underlined that dignity is an inherent and inseparable right 
of a human being and has thus been guaranteed by our Constitution as 
an absolute, non-negotiable and inviolable fundamental right that is not 
subject to any qualification, restriction or regulation.8 Dignity values the 
worth of each person and requires the recognition of each person's 
worth to be held in equal measure for all.9 It is harmed when individuals 
are marginalized, ignored or devalued, and is enhanced when the full 
place of all individuals within the society is recognized. 
In another case reported as “TAHIR NAQASH and others Versus The 
STATE and others” (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 385), the expression is 
as follows; 
10. 
Article 14 of the Constitution guarantees right to dignity to every 
person. Human dignity encapsulates the notion that every person has 
inherent equal worth. This simple but profound concept has three 

4 W.P.No.32441.23. 
 
elements: first, every member of the human family has value - no one can 
be dismissed, ignored, mistreated or abused as if their humanity means 
nothing; second, each person's worth is equal to every other person and 
no one's life is more important than any other person; third, human 
dignity inheres in the human person and cannot be taken away. 
6. 
The above dictum is binding on every organ of the State under Article 
189 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and to be 
followed while dealing to a law-and-order situation.  
7. 
Although we had entered avowed in 21st century with pride and 
determination to provide shelter to masses against poverty, unemployment, 
injustice and other similar vices but we had formalized our life in a shadowy 
digital world to see everything with the lens of others; even the Media once 
acclaimed as the fair reporter has flown into the indigenous individualism 
being propagated by everyone who is holding a most dangerous weapon i.e., 
‘android phone’ in their hands. The unpleasant and surprise events of 9th 
May, 2023 under the shadow of unbridled mob have defaced the peaceful 
and democratic image of this country; the responsible should be answerable 
but not in a way as resorted to by the government by putting lasso to each 
and every one of its choice without knowing his role in the riots.  Riots are 
suppressed with force under the law as regulated u/s 127 to 132 of Cr.P.C. 
and not in the way adopted by the government to pick and detain the citizens 
under Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960 without registration of 
criminal cases. This move would be like and seems vindication of selected 
grievances: if this confrontation continues, where if this would end, lest it 
should erode our foundation, we must stand out to fight against this 
vandalism with sound short-term and long-term measures by involving the 
religious scholars, intellectuals, philosophers, scientists, politicians, 
bureaucrats, justice analyst, IT experts & programmers etc. to welcome the 
general masses to return to normalcy by identifying their role as the 
peacekeeper and builders of Pakistan. The initiative always moves from 
minority which leads the majority; of course in this case, it is only the 
government that would take initiative to realize the need for a solution and in 
this context of amelioration government is not expected to take revenge from 
their own public rather own them if feel they are derailed. Love and 
affection have no boundaries, nor it can be confined or subjugated; once it 

5 W.P.No.32441.23. 
 
opens arms, it envelopes all ‘bad or good’ under the shadow, and it is the 
Divine Rule too. Allow the people to breath in liberty with dignity, give a go 
to their life flourish in peaceful assembly and freedom to move everywhere 
with equal rights by avoiding discrimination, make them informed about 
their rights to education, securing government service and acquisition of 
property with freedom of trade, business and profession so that they may 
become prosper, capable to speak with freedom, acquire social justice, play 
their role to model them into a Muslim society, enrich their culture, ensure 
protection of minorities, develop brotherhood with the people of their 
neigbour countries, being helpful to devise a strategic foreign policy so as to 
bring amity in the region countenanced with internal security and peace. It is 
not farsighted, once we raise the emblem high under unity, faith and 
discipline with efficiency, competency and honesty. Who would ring the 
bell, certainly not the one but we all in a line up with defined roles, should 
desist not to overlap and while exercising restraint promote harmony to one 
goal, i.e., Prosper Pakistan. Some elements if are considered as miscreants 
can be restricted through initiation of criminal process like registration of 
criminal cases.  
8. 
This court on 30.03.2023 in W.P.No.20258/2023 titled as “Hafiz Ali 
Raza Vs Deputy Commissioner, Lahore, etc.” (2023 LHC 1304) in a similar 
situation has directed the authorities to collect certain material before 
passing an order for preventive detention to meet the threshold as set out 
through different judicial precedents of Superior Courts like; “Federation of 
Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Interior Islamabad. v. Mrs. Amtul 
Jalil Khawaja and others” (PLD 2003 SC 442) “MUHAMMAD IRSHAD 
versus GOVERNMENT OF THE PUNJAB and others” (2020 P Cr. L J 
206), “SHAHID RASOOL versus GOVERNMENT OF THE PUNJAB 
through Secretary Home Department, Lahore and 6 others” (2023 YLR 
333) and “MUHAMMAD ABDAAL alias ABDALI versus GOVERNMENT 
OF PUNJAB and others” (PLD 2020 Lahore 471). Even the connotation of 
reasonable grounds was also highlighted in the above judgment but it is 
highly unfortunate and regrettable that authorities do not follow the spirit of 
judicial decisions; therefore, in like situations, the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan has directed to impose cost upon the authorities if the order of 

6 W.P.No.32441.23. 
 
detention is found to be in flagrant violation of the mandatory requirements 
of law and Article 10 of the Constitution. Reliance is on cases reported as 
“GOVERNMENT OF SINDH and others Versus Mst. NAJMA” (2001 
SCMR 8); “STATE through Advocate-General, Sindh, Karachi Versus Mst. 
TAJI BIBI” (2002 SCMR 914).  
9. 
The above discussion is concluded in the terms that the order 
impugned being bereft of any supportive material, as discussed in preceding 
paragraph No.2, is declared as passed in flagrant violation of section 3 of the 
Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960; therefore, it is hereby set 
aside while imposing cost of Rs.5000/- per day for a period of detention to 
be paid to the detenu who shall be released immediately.
