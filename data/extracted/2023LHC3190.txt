2. 
Tersely, the facts of the case as disclosed by Ghulam Shabbir 
Inspector (PW.2) as per crime report (Exh.PF) are that on 22.01.2018 
at about 12:00 p.m. (noon), he received information through 15 
wireless that at 10:30 a.m. Abdul Sattar (appellant) armed with Kasi 
and Abdul Ghaffar (appellant) armed with club committed the murder 
of Muhammad Irshad and Shamim Bibi in Chak No.112/DB Basti 
due to dispute of amount of cattle. On receipt of information, Ghulam 
Shabbir (PW.2) alongwith Sarwar 100/C and Tahir Iqbal 2177/C on 
official vehicle reached at the place of occurrence in Chak 
No.112/DB Basti and saw that dead bodies of Muhammad Irshad and 
Shamim Bibi were lying in the courtyard of a house without door. He 
observed injuries on head, right calf and foot of Shamim Bibi 
(deceased) and also observed reddish-blue marks on mouth and neck 
of Muhammad Irshad (deceased) and blood was oozing from his 
mouth. Muhammad Shehzad, real son of deceased persons, Mukhtiar 
Ahmad real brother of Shamim Bibi (deceased) and Muhammad 
Aslam Arian were present at the place of occurrence, who informed 
him that Muhammad Irshad (deceased) had to take an amount of 
Rs.90,000/- of cattle from his brothers Abdul Sattar and Abdul 
Ghaffar (appellants), who were not ready to return the said amount 
but Muhammad Irshad (deceased) was insisting to get the said 
amount from them at every cost. Upon this, Abdul Sattar (appellant) 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021

while armed with Kassi and Abdul Ghaffar (appellant) armed with 
club came at the place of occurrence, encircled safa around the neck 
of Muhammad Irshad (deceased)  and gave fists and slaps on his face, 
one side of safa was pulled by Abdul Sattar (appellant) and other side 
was pulled by Abdul Ghaffar (appellant) and they throttled 
Muhammad Irshad (deceased). Shamim Bibi wife of Muhammad 
Irshad came to rescue her husband, then Abdul Sattar (appellant) 
made Kassi blow which hit on her head and Abdul Ghaffar (appellant) 
gave club blows to her. The above said witnesses, while witnessing 
the occurrence, reached the place of occurrence and on their arrival, 
the appellants succeeded in fleeing away from the spot, but 
Muhammad Irshad and Shamim Bibi succumbed to the injuries at the 
spot. The appellants had committed the occurrence due to the dispute 
of amount of cattle which was due upon appellants, hence, the FIR.  
3. 
After registration of crime report, investigation of the case was 
entrusted to Shams-ud-Din S.I. (PW.12), who, on the same day, 
visited the place of occurrence; inspected the dead bodies of 
Muhammad Irshad and Shamim Bibi and prepared their injury 
statements (Exh.PK and Exh.PL); prepared inquest reports of 
Muhammad Irshad and Shamim Bibi (Exh.PM and Exh.PN), also 
prepared rough site plan of the place of occurrence (Exh.PO). He 
(PW.12) secured blood stained earth from underneath the dead body 
of Shamim Bibi, made it into sealed parcel and took the same in to 
possession vide recovery memo (Exh.PA). He (PW.12) recorded 
statements of PWs u/s 161 Cr.P.C. and sent the dead bodies of 
Muhammad Irshad and Shamim Bibi to THQ Hospital, Yazman, 
through Aftab Amin 1606/C (PW.5). On 23.01.2018, Aftab Amin 
1606/C (PW.5) handed over to him (PW.12) post mortem reports of 
Muhammad Irshad and Shamim Bibi (Exh.PE and Exh.PJ), last worn 
clothes of deceased Muhammad Irshad as well as Shamim Bibi and 
seven sealed boxes, which he took into possession through recovery 
memo (Exh.PG), attested by PWs. He (PW.12) recorded statements 
u/s 161 Cr.P.C of three witnesses. On 11.02.20218, he (PW.12) 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021

12.02.2018 he obtained their physical remand. On 18.02.20218, 
Abdul Ghaffar (appellant) got recovered weapon of offence i.e blood 
stained club in two pieces (P.1) from his residential room lying under 
the cot, which was taken into possession vide recovery memo 
(Exh.PB), attested by PWs. He (PW.12) prepared site plan of place 
of recovery (Exh.PP) and recorded statements of PWs u/s 161 Cr.P.C. 
On the same day, Abdul Sattar (appellant) got recovered weapon of 
offence i.e. blood stained Kassi (P.2) and safa (P.3) from his 
residential room lying under the cot, which were taken into 
possession vide recovery memo (Exh.PC), attested by PWs. He 
(PW.12) also prepared site plan of place of recovery (Exh.PQ) and 
recorded statements u/s 161 Cr.P.C of PWs. After completion of 
investigation, report under section 173, Cr.P.C. was submitted before 
the learned trial court.  
4. 
After observing all pre-trial codal formalities, charge under 
sections 302, 34 PPC was framed against the appellants on 
04.05.2018 to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.  
5. 
In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced as many as 
fifteen witnesses during the trial. Ghulam Shabbir Inspector (PW.2) 
is the complainant of the case, who got lodged FIR (Exh.PF), whereas 
Asghar Ali ASI (PW.4), being duty officer, chalked out FIR 
(Exh.PF). Ocular account has been furnished by Mukhtiar Ahmad 
(PW.1), Muhammad Shehzad (PW.7) and Muhammad Aslam 
(PW.8). Aftab Amin 1606/C (PW.5) escorted the dead bodies to the 
hospital for post mortem examination, whereas Muhammad Yaseen

6. 
On completion of prosecution evidence, the appellants were 
examined under section 342 Cr.P.C. whereby they once again denied 
the allegations leveled against them and professed their innocence. 
While answering to a question, “why this case against you and why 
the PWs have deposed against you? the appellants stated as under:- 
Abdul Ghaffar appellant:- 
“I have falsely been involved/implicated in this case. 
Mukhtiar Ahmad PW-1 who instigated the complainant to 
name me in this false case. Neither I am involved in the 
alleged occurrence nor I could think to kill my real brother 
and my Bhabhi. There was no dispute ever between me and 
my brother and a false motive is introduced by PW-1. In fact, 
Mukhtiar on account of dispute of rishta between my family 
and the family of Mukhtiar Ahmad PW-1 has falsely deposed 
against me. I had cordial relations with my brother, 
however, PW-1 was restrained by my deceased brother to 
visit his house. No independent person come forward to 
depose against me. Inmate of the house of the occurrence do 
not support the version of the complainant. None of the 
witnesses produced by the prosecution ever witnessed the 
alleged occurrence. Mukhtiar Ahmad on account of grudge 
of refusal of hand of my sister namely Shamshad Bibi falsely 
deposed against me. I am innocent and have committed no 
offence. I have been informed by the children of my deceased 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021

brother that some unknown dacoits killed my brother and his 
wife. I am innocent.”  
Abdul Sattar appellant:- 
“I have falsely been involved/implicated in this case. 
Mukhtiar Ahmad PW-1 who instigated the complainant to 
name me in this false case. Neither I am involved in the 
alleged occurrence nor I could think to kill my real brother 
and my Bhabhi. There was no dispute ever between me and 
my brother and a false motive is introduced by PW-1. In fact, 
Mukhtiar on account of dispute of rishta between my family 
and the family of Mukhtiar Ahmad Pw-1 has falsely deposed 
against me. I had cordial relations with my brother, 
however, PW-1 was restrained by my deceased brother to 
visit his house. No independent person come forward to 
depose against me. Inmate of the house of the occurrence do 
not support the version of the complainant. None of the 
witnesses produced by the prosecution ever witnessed the 
alleged occurrence. Mukhtiar Ahmad on account of grudge 
of refusal of hand of my sister namely Shamshad Bibi falsely 
deposed against me. I am innocent and have committed no 
offence. I have been informed by the children of my deceased 
brother that some unknown dacoits killed my brother and his 
wife. I am innocent.”  
 
The appellants neither opted to make statements on oath as 
provided under Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor produced any evidence in 
disproof of the allegations leveled by the prosecution against them.  
7. 
The learned trial court, on conclusion of trial, vide judgment 
dated 29.04.2021, convicted and sentenced the appellants as 
mentioned hereinabove.  
8. 
Learned counsel for the appellants argued that the FIR in this 
case was lodged with the delay of four hours and ten minutes after the 
incident and thereafter post mortem examinations on the dead bodies 
of deceased persons were conducted with further delay of 22 to 24 
hours, which conclusively proved that it was an unseen occurrence; 
that though the prosecution tried to make it a case of direct evidence, 
but none of the alleged eye witnesses namely Mukhtiar Ahmad 
(PW.1), Muhammad Shehzad (PW.7) and Muhammad Aslam (PW.8) 
bothered to step forward and lodge crime report, which was actually 
lodged by a police officer with considerable delay; that amongst the 
alleged eye witnesses, Muhammad Shehzad (PW.7) did not claim 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021 
 
7
before the leaned trial court to have himself witnessed the occurrence 
whereas Mukhtiar Ahmad (PW.1) and Muhammad Aslam (PW.8) 
could not justify their presence at the spot at relevant time and they 
both happened to be chance, related and interested witnesses; that 
when both the appellants were not armed with any formidable 
weapons, why the above mentioned eye witnesses did not physically 
intervene and attempted to apprehend them; that unnatural conduct of 
alleged eye witnesses also speaks volume about their non-availability 
at the scene of occurrence at relevant time; that in the absence of any 
trustworthy and confidence inspiring ocular account, medical 
evidence becomes irrelevant qua alleged culpability of appellants; 
that the recoveries of blood stained Kassi (P.1) from Abdul Ghaffar 
(appellant) as well as blood stained club (P.2) and safa (P.3) from 
Abdul Sattar (appellant) were fake and planted and with the passage 
of time, presence of blood on these articles was naturally impossible, 
which fact also creates doubt upon the veracity of PFSA reports; that 
the investigating officer had not probed about the alleged motive part 
of occurrence and no substantial evidence has been led by the 
prosecution in this regard, which makes the story of motive highly 
doubtful. Lastly contended that the prosecution has miserably failed 
to prove the case against the appellants and has prayed that the 
appellants may be acquitted of the charge levelled against them by 
accepting the instant appeal. 
9. 
Conversely, learned Law Officer argued that the prosecution 
has successfully proved its case against the appellants beyond any 
shadow of doubt through convincing, unimpeachable and 
overwhelming evidence. He further submitted that the delay in 
lodging the FIR as well as conducting post mortem examination is 
not fatal to the prosecution’s case; that the appellants had been duly 
nominated in the FIR and during trial the prosecution witnesses stood 
firm against them; that the appellants had committed the murder of 
two innocent persons, one of whom was their real brother and the 
other was their sister-in-law and the learned trial court has already 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021 
 
8
taken leniency while deciding the quantum of sentences. Finally, 
learned Law Officer has prayed for dismissal of appeal.  
10. 
I have observed that according to the narration of F.I.R (Exh. 
PF) in the gory incident an innocent couple was done to death. The 
appellants have allegedly committed the heinous offence which has a 
stringent punishment, so principle of natural justice demands that 
prosecution should led evidence of such characteristic which needs to 
no other conclusion except the guilt of the accused without any hint 
of doubt and benefit of a single doubt in the prosecution case must be 
extended in their favour. So, I have to decide the instant appeal in the 
light of above mentioned principle of law.      
11. 
As per prosecution story, occurrence had reportedly taken 
place on 22.01.2018 at about 10:30 a.m. but despite that the police 
station was merely sixteen kilometers away from the place of 
occurrence, the alleged eye witnesses of tragedy did not bother to 
inform the police about the occurrence. Mukhitar Ahmad (PW.1), 
who is one of the purported eye witnesses, has stated during his cross-
examination as under:- 
“……I did not visit police station to inform the police about 
the occurrence on the day of occurrence nor I tried to bring 
the police. Neither I called at 1122 nor I arranged any 
vehicle for shifting the Irshad and Shamim Bibi to the 
hospital……” 
Similarly, Muhammad Aslam (PW.8), another alleged eye 
witness, has stated during his cross-examination as infra:- 
“……About three hours after the occurrence police reached 
at the place of occurrence. On the day of occurrence none of 
us went to police station to inform police. We did not try to 
shift Irshad and Shamim to any hospital prior to arrival of 
police. Neither we tried to serve water to Irshad and Shamim 
nor we tried to shift them on some clean place……” 
According to the narration of FIR (Exh.PF), Ghulam Shabbir 
Inspector (PW.2) reached at the place of occurrence at 01:15 p.m. but 
even at that very moment, none of the stated eye witnesses stepped 
forward to be complainant of the case and report the incident to him. 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021

Nothing is available on the record as to what was the reason which 
forced Ghulam Shabbir Inspector (PW.2) to himself become 
complainant of this murder case that too while claiming the presence 
of close relatives of deceased persons at the scene of occurrence. 
Delay in lodging the FIR (Exh.PF), is shouting louder than everything 
that the crime report was registered after due deliberation and 
consultation and the intervening time was consumed in collecting 
details about the relatives of deceased, what to say about their 
presence at the time of occurrence, they were not even present at the 
time of lodging FIR, because, if they were present there, one of them 
must have at least become the complainant of the case. While holding 
so, I am guided by the dictum of law laid down by the apex Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the cases of “Muhammad Asif v. The State” 
(2008 SCMR 1001) and “Nazir Ahmad v. The State” (2018 SCMR 
787). 
12. 
I have further observed that it is not only a case of delayed 
reporting the matter to the police but also of delayed post  mortem 
examination as according to prosecution’s own showing, post 
mortem examinations on the dead bodies of Muhammad Irshad 
(deceased) and Mst. Shamim Bibi (deceased) were conducted with 
the delay of 22 and 24 hours respectively, which casts further doubt 
upon the veracity of prosecution version. I have fortified my view 
from the dictum laid down in the cases titled “Sufyan Nawaz and 
another v. The State and others” (2020 SCMR 192), wherein the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:- 
“…. As per post  mortem examination report, autopsy on the 
dead body of Kabeer Ahmad was conducted on 24.10.2005 
at 10.00 p.m. The unexplained delay of about ten hours in 
autopsy of Kabeer Ahmad (deceased) alone creates dent in 
the prosecution story so far as presence of eye-witnesses at 
the place of occurrence is concerned.” 
Further guidance has been sought from the cases of 
“Muhammad Adnan and another v. The State and others” (2021 
SCMR 16), “Khalid Mehmood and another v. The State and others” 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021 
 
10
(2021 SCMR 810) and “Pervaiz Khan and another v. The State” 
(2022 SCMR 393). 
13. 
FIR (Exh.PF) further uncovers that according to prosecution’s 
version, Mukhtiar Ahmad (PW.1), Muhammad Shehzad (PW.7) and 
Muhammad Aslam (PW.8), while witnessing the occurrence, reached 
the place of occurrence and on their arrival, the appellants succeeded 
in fleeing away from the spot. Out of the above said prosecution 
witnesses, Muhammad Shehzad (PW.7) was the real son of ill-fated 
couple and inmate of the house, but during his cross-examination, he 
himself categorically stated that he was not present in his house at the 
time of occurrence and had not witnessed the tragedy with his own 
eyes and he further destructively stated that even nobody else was 
present at the place of occurrence when he came to his house and 
found the dead bodies of his parents lying there. Relevant portion of 
his cross-examination is reproduced as infra:- 
“….I went to school on the day of occurrence of this case. I 
went to school at 8:00 a.m. Time of closing of school was 
1:00 p.m. It is correct that attendance of students is always 
marked in the school. My attendance was also marked in the 
school on the day of murder of my parents. When I was 
learning my lesson in the school my younger brother 
Muhammad Afzal came in the house and he informed me that 
my parents have been murdered. I on foot rushed to my house 
and reached there within 6/7 minutes. When I reached home 
nobody was present in my house, however, few children were 
playing in the street. When I reached in my house I found 
dead bodies of my parents and due to this reason I failed to 
raise alarm. My maternal uncle Mukhtar Ahmad firstly met 
me in THQ hospital Yazman on the day of occurrence 
wherefrom we came to police station Saddar Yazman. 
Mukhtar Ahmad was not present in my house when I reached 
there. I met with Mukhtar Ahmad in police station Saddar 
Yazman at 3:00 p.m. 1 firstly saw Mukhtar Ahmad in Yazman 
at 2:00 p.m in THQ Yazman. Muhammad Aslam PW is not 
my neighbourer. Volunteered we reside in Basti whereas 
house of Muhammad Aslam is in Chak. House of Muhammad 
Aslam is 3/4 kilometers away from my house. Aslam PW was 
not present in my house when I reached there. Aslam met me 
firstly on the day of occurrence at 1:00 p.m on the road. 
Aslam is a cultivator. Aslam PW used to work for police and 
he also visits police stations for the work of people and 
manages give and take between people of area and police. 
We were not willing to cite Aslam as PW but police forcibly 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021 
 
11
introduced Aslam as witness. Muhammad Aslam and 
Mukhtar were not present at the place of occurrence when 
my parents were murdered.” 
 
Above reproduced portion from the statement of Muhammad 
Shehzad (PW.7), alone, would be enough to brush aside the whole 
prosecution case, however, to satisfy my conscience, I would further 
dig out the prosecution case, particularly the statements of other two 
prosecution witnesses namely Mukhtiar Ahmad (PW.1) and 
Muhammad Aslam (PW.8). Deep scrutiny of their statements has led 
this Court to hold that they were nothing but chance witnesses who 
had miserably failed to advance any plausible reason for their 
presence at the place of occurrence at relevant time. Mukhtiar Ahmad 
(PW.1) in his cross-examination, has stated that his house is about 
50-kilometers away from the place of occurrence. He (PW1) has 
further stated in his cross-examination which is as under:- 
I did not raise hue and cry to attract the people of vicinity.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
I did not visit police station to inform the police about 
the occurrence on the day of occurrence nor I tried to 
bring the police. Neither I called at 1122 nor I arranged 
any vehicle for shifting the Irshad and Shamim Bibi to 
the hospital.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
As per my statement before this Court I was present at 
the place of occurrence as per chance and then this 
occurrence happened.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
I did not make any phone call to police at 15. I did not 
produce any witness of any transaction of amount 
between deceased and accused persons.  
 
 Likewise, Muhammad Aslam (PW.8) though claimed during 
his cross-examination that his house was at a distance of 3 squares 
from the place of occurrence but according to Muhammad Shehzad 
(PW.7), real son of the deceased persons, the house of Muhammad 
Aslam (PW.8) was 3 kilometers away. In addition to the above, 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021 
 
12
Mukhtiar Ahmad (PW.1) and Muhammad Aslam (PW.8) were unable 
to give any plausible reason for their presence at the spot at the time 
of occurrence. In this context, Muhammad Shehzad (PW.7) has stated 
in his cross-examination that his father Muhammad Irshad (deceased) 
had dispute with Mukhtiar Ahmad (PW.1) and they were not in 
talking terms with him. He (PW.7) further stated that his parents 
(deceased persons) had restrained Mukhtiar Ahmad (PW.1) from 
visiting the houses of each other and they were having eliminated 
relations even for marriages and death occasions. So far as 
Muhammad Aslam (PW.8) is concerned, he was not related to the 
deceased persons and according to the statement of Muhammad 
Shehzad (PW.7), he appears to be a stock witness of police. The 
relevant portion of statement of (PW8) reads as under for ready 
reference:- 
On the day of occurrence none of us went to police 
station to inform police. We did not try to shift Irshad 
and Shamim to any hospital prior to arrival of police. 
Neither we tried to serve water to Irshad and Shamim 
nor we tried to shift them on some clean place. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
It is correct that as per my statement before the police 
and as per my statement before this Court neither I nor 
any other person intervened during the occurrence.  
 
 Keeping in view the aforementioned peculiar circumstances of 
the case, it is vivid that the place of occurrence in this case was the 
one where Mukhtiar Ahmad (PW.1) and Muhammad Aslam (PW.8) 
should have not normally been present exactly at the time of 
occurrence and when this fact is taken into account along with 
considerable delay in lodging the FIR as well as conducting post  
mortem examination on the dead bodies of deceased persons, I find 
no option but to declare them related, interested and chance witnesses 
and as such their evidence is not free from doubt. Reference in this 
respect may be made to the cases titled as “Mst. Mir Zalai v. Ghazi 
Khan and others” (2020 SCMR 319), “Ibrar Hussain and another v. 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021 
 
13
The State” (2020 SCMR 1850) and “Liaqat Ali and another v. The 
State and others” (2021 SCMR 780). 
14. 
Apart from the above, the behavior of above cited eye 
witnesses remained tremendously unnatural. Mukhtar Ahmad (PW1) 
appeared in the witness box before the learned trial court and has 
stated as under:-   
“Neither we apprehended any accused nor snatch kasi 
or danda from them. 
Similarly, Muhammad Aslam (PW8) has admitted in so many words 
before the learned trial court which is as under:- 
“Dead bodies remained lying at the place of occurrence 
for about 5-hours and 30-minutes. I did not apprehend 
any accused on the day of occurrence. Neither I nor 
Mukhtar followed the accused persons. Volunteered that 
accused persons threatened us. Accused persons were 
not armed with any fire arm. Neither I nor Mukhtar or 
other persons tried to rescue the deceased persons from 
the accused persons. None of us sustained any scratch. 
Neither I nor Mukhtar raised alarm to attract the 
persons of vicinity”.  
 It is prosecution’s personal version that the alleged eye witnesses 
have been three male participants while the two appellants have been 
now not armed with any bold weapon to terrify them from saving the 
deceased individuals. It isn't appealable to a prudent thought that if 
the above mentioned eye witnesses have been present at the house of 
incident, then what impeded them from bodily intervention to 
apprehend the appellants after the incidence or let them break out 
unhurt. Under the occasions, it could be thoroughly held that the 
above stated eye witnesses had been neither present on the spot at the 
applicable time, nor they had witnessed the occurrence.  I may refer 
here the case of “Liaqat Ali v. The State” (2008 SCMR 95). Similar 
view was reiterated by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
cases of “Pathan v. the State” (2015 SCMR 315), Mst. Rukhsana 
Begum and others vs. Sajjad and others (2017 SCMR 596), “Zafar 
v. The State and others” (2018 SCMR 326), Tariq Mehmood vs. The 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021 
 
14
State (2021 SCMR 471) and “Shaukat Hussain v. The State” (2022 
SCMR 1358). 
15. 
Another exciting element of the case which created similarly 
doubt upon the veracity of alleged eye witnesses is that as according 
to inquest report (Exh.PM) of Muhammad Irshad (deceased) as well 
as the assertion of Dr. Muhammad Daud Adnan (PW.3) who 
performed autopsy on his lifeless frame, the mouth and eyes of 
Muhammad Irshad (deceased) had been found opened. Similarly, as 
in keeping with inquest report (Exh.PN) of Shamim Bibi (deceased) 
as well as the statement of Lady Dr. Shafaq Khalid (PW.10) who 
carried out post-mortem on her dead body, her eyes were discovered 
opened. This fact shows that no person had afflicted to close the eyes 
and mouth of Muhammad Irshad (deceased) as well as the eyes of 
Shamim Bibi (deceased), which couldn't have befell in the presence 
of eye witnesses. Reliance is placed upon the cases titled as 
“Muhammad Asif vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 486), “Zahir Yousaf 
and another v. The State and another” (2017 SCMR 2002) and 
“Muhammad Rafique alias Feeqa v. The State” (2019 SCMR 1068). 
 
16. 
Another important aspect of the case, which cannot lost sight 
of is that the witnesses of ocular account, Mukhtiar Ahmad (PW.1), 
Muhammad Shehzad (PW.7) and Muhammad Aslam (PW.8) are not 
witnesses of inquest reports (Exh.PM and Exh.PN) as well as post 
mortem reports (Exh.PE and Exh.PJ) pertaining to Muhammad Irshad 
(deceased) and Shamim Bibi (deceased). If they were present at the 
scene of the occurrence at the relevant time, they must have been the 
witnesses of inquest reports. Similarly, they should have escorted the 
dead bodies to the hospital being the close relatives and their names 
should have been incorporated in the post mortem reports in the 
column of identification of the dead bodies.  This fact has constrained 
me to hold that supra mentioned PWs were not present at the time and 
place of occurrence. Reliance is placed upon the following case laws 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021 
 
15
titled as “Abdul Jabbar alias Jabri v. The State” (2017 SCMR 1155) 
and “Nadeem alias Kala v. The State and others” (2018 SCMR 153).  
17. 
Coming to the evidentiary worth of medical evidence, it is 
settled law that medical evidence may confirm the ocular evidence 
with regard to the seat of injury, nature of the injury, kind of weapon 
used in the occurrence but it would not connect the accused with the 
commission of offence. Reference in this respect may be made to the 
cases titled as “Sajjan Solangi v. The State” (2019 SCMR 872) and 
“Naveed Asghar and 2 others v. The State” (PLD 2021 SC 600).  
18. 
I have also noted that Mukhtar Ahmad (PW1) and Muhammad 
Aslam (PW8) have made dishonest improvements in their statements 
before the learned trial Court and the relevant parts of their statements 
during cross-examination, read as under:-  
PW-1 Mukhtar Ahmad 
 
“Whatever I stated before the court in verbatim I 
narrated before the police. I never disclosed before 
the police that on 21.01.2018 in evening time I along 
with Rani Bibi went to the house of Shamim Bibi to 
see her. I did not disclose before the police in my 
statement u/s 161 of Cr.P.C. that I and my mother 
Rani Bibi were sitting in the room of house of Irshad 
and on hearing hue and cry, we came out from the 
room. I got recorded in my statement that Abdul 
Sattar accused encircled safa around the neck of 
Irshad deceased. Confronted with Exh. DB where it is 
not recorded.   
PW-8 Muhammad Aslam 
 
 
“I never stated before the police that I and 
Mukhtar PW reached at the place of occurrence on 
hearing hue and cry of Shehzad. Confronted with 
Exh. DA where is so recorded.     
  
Due to the dishonest improvements, made in their statements 
of supra mentioned PWs, I am of the view that both the PWs are not 
truthful witnesses and their evidence is not worthy of reliance. It is 
cardinal principle of law that any statement improved during trial is 
not worth relying, which is also deprecated by the principle 
enunciated in two salutary judgments by august Supreme Court of 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021 
 
16
Pakistan. In the case of “Saeed Ahmed Shah vs. The State”             
(1993 SCMR 550), it has been held that the statement of any witness 
improved at trial is not worth relying rather such improvement creates 
serious doubt about his veracity and credibility. Similar view was 
taken in another case reported as “Muhammad Rafique and others vs. 
The State and others” (2010 SCMR 385). 
19. 
I am also conscious of the fact that the prosecution has made 
an abortive attempt to strengthen its case through the recovery of 
weapons of offence i.e. club (P.1) at the instance of Abdul Ghaffar 
appellant on 18.02.2018 from his house vide possession memo 
(Exh.PB), Kassi (P2) and safa (P.3) at the instance of Abdul Sattar 
appellant on 18.02.2018 from his house vide possession memo 
(Exh.PC) and the report (Exh.PR) of the Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore, according to which human blood was found present 
on club (P.1) and Kassi (P.2). It does not appeal to a prudent mind 
that after committing the incident, the said appellants would keep the 
weapons of offence i.e. club, kassi and safa, stained with human 
blood, in safe custody for about 27 days as they had ample 
opportunity during the above mentioned period to destroy such a 
corroborative evidence. In an identical case reported as “Basharat 
and another vs. The State” (1995 SCMR 1735), Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, while disbelieving the evidence of blood stained 
chhuri allegedly recovered from the accused after ten days from the 
occurrence, observed as under:- 
“11. The occurrence took place on 20-4-1988. Basharat 
appellant was arrested on 28-4-1988. The blood-stained 
Chhuri was alleged recovered from his house on 30-4-1988. 
It is not believable that he would have kept blood-stained 
Chhuri intact in his house for ten days when he had sufficient 
time and opportunity to wash away and clean the blood on 
it…” 
Moreover,  the alleged recoveries were effected after twenty 
seven days of the occurrence and subsequently the recovered articles 
were received in the office of Punjab Forensic Science Agency on 
19.04.2023 i.e. two months and twenty eight days after the 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021 
 
17
occurrence, thus, it was also not likely that the blood would not 
disintegrate in the meanwhile. I fortify my view from the case titled 
as “Muhammad Jamil v. Muhammad Akram and others” (2009 
SCMR 120) and “Faisal Mehmood v. The State” (2016 SCMR 
2138). In the light of above circs, these pieces of evidence are not 
helpful to the prosecution. 
20. 
The motive alleged by prosecution was that Muhammad Irshad 
(deceased) had to take an amount of Rs.90,000/- of cattle from his 
brothers Abdul Sattar and Abdul Ghaffar appellants, who were not 
ready to return the said amount but Muhammad Irshad (deceased) was 
insisting to get the said amount from them at every cost. It is 
noteworthy that there is a haunting silence regarding the minutiae of 
motive alleged by the prosecution. Muhammad Shehzad (PW7) has 
disclosed in his cross-examination as infra:- 
“There was no dispute between my father and his 
brother named as accused in this case prior to the 
occurrence. 
 
 Even Shams-ud-Din S.I./I.O. (PW.12) has stated in his cross-
examination as under:- 
“None deposed before me as to when, 
where and in whose presence transaction 
of amount between deceased and accused 
took place. None claimed to witness of said 
transaction. Neither I investigated the 
motive part of the occurrence nor I gave 
any finding with regard to the motive.   ”  
 
I have observed that neither he (PW12) investigated the motive part 
of the occurrence nor he gave any finding with regard to the motive. 
Although prosecution is not under obligation to establish motive in 
each and every murder case, but it is also a well settled principle of 
criminal jurisprudence that if the prosecution sets up a motive and 
fails to prove it, then it is the prosecution who has to suffer and not 
the accused. I very respectfully rely on the cases of “Tajamal Hussain 
Shah v. The State and another” (2022 SCMR 1567), “Ali Asghar 

Crl. Appeal No.245 of 2021 
 
18
alias Aksar v. The State” (2023 SCMR 596) and “Sarfraz and 
another v. The State” (2023 SCMR 670). 
21. 
   Epitome of the above comprehensive discussion is that the 
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the appellants 
beyond the shadow of doubt rather the shadows of doubt are 
looming in this case. It is a well-established principle of 
administration of justice in criminal cases that finding of guilt 
against an accused person cannot be based merely on the high 
probabilities that may be inferred from evidence in a given case. 
The findings as regard their guilt should be rested surely and firmly 
on the evidence produced in the case and the plain inferences of 
guilt that may irresistibly be drawn from that evidence. Mere 
conjectures and probabilities cannot take the place of proof. If a 
case is decided merely on high probabilities regarding the existence 
or non-existence of a fact to prove the guilt of a person, the golden 
rule of giving "benefit of doubt" to an accused person, which has 
been a dominant feature of the administration of criminal justice in 
this country with the consistent approval of the Constitutional 
Courts, will be reduced to a naught. The prosecution is under 
obligation to prove its case against the accused person at the 
standard of proof required in criminal cases, beyond reasonable 
doubt standard, and cannot be said to have discharged this 
obligation by producing evidence that merely meets the 
preponderance of probability. If the prosecution fails to discharge 
its said obligation and there remains a reasonable doubt, not an 
imaginary or artificial doubt, as to the guilt of the accused person, 
the benefit of that doubt is to be given to the accused person as of 
right, not as of concession. Reference is made to the cases titled 
“Sajjad Hussain v. The State and others” (2022 SCMR 1540) and 
“Tajamal Hussain Shah v. The State and another” (2022 SCMR 
1567), “Ahmad Ali and another vs. The State” (2023 SCMR 781) and 
“Sarfraz and another vs. The State” (2023 SCMR 670).

22. 
For the foregoing reasons, Criminal Appeal No.245 of 2021 
filed by Abdul Ghaffar and Abdul Sattar (appellants) is accepted, 
their conviction and sentences are set aside and they are acquitted 
of the charges leveled against them while extending the benefit of 
doubt in their favour. They shall be released from jail forthwith if 
not required to be kept therein in connection with any other case.
