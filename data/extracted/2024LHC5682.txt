“Society wins not only when the guilty are convicted but when the criminal 
trials are fair; our system of the administration of justice suffers when any 
accused is treated unfairly.” 
           – Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, (1963) 
 
 
 
 
Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – The Petitioner, National 
Accountability Bureau (NAB), has filed Reference No. 06/2023  
(the “Reference”) under section 24(b) of the National Accountability 
Ordinance, 1999 (“NAO”), against Respondents No. 1 & 2 and others, 
alleging corruption and corrupt practices. The Reference is currently 
pending trial before Accountability Court No. X, Lahore. 
2. 
 
On 01.02.2024, the Accountability Court provided copies of 
the Reference along with the annexed documents/evidence to 
Respondents No. 1 & 2, as well as the other accused, in terms of section 
24(b) of the NAO, read with section 265-C of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, 1898 (“Cr.P.C.”), and scheduled the case for indictment on 
14.02.2024. However, the charges were not framed on that date, and the 
case was adjourned.

3. 
 
On 19.03.2024, Respondents No. 1 & 2 filed two separate 
applications before the Accountability Court. Respondent No.1 submitted 
that when the NAB initiated the proceedings, Mahr Azmat Hayat and 
Sohail Akram were among his co-accused and participated in the inquiry 
as accused persons. Subsequently, both received pardons and became 
approvers. Now, they are listed as prosecution witnesses in the Reference. 
Respondent No.1 asserted that the prosecution had deliberately failed to 
append the previous statements of these approvers with the Reference and 
had not provided their copies to him. 
4. 
 
In his application, Respondent No.2 stated that several 
persons joined the inquiry and investigation of the case. The Inquiry 
Officer’s report dated 06.07.2023 reflected that he had recorded the 
statements of eleven (11) persons, namely Amir Allah Ditta, Farman 
Iqbal, Asjad Ali, Gulfam Shahzada, Malik Imran, Khurram Sultan, 
Waqas Shaukat, Muhammad Usman, Tariq Perviaz, the Secretary C&W, 
and Mahr Azmat Hayat. Respondent No. 2 alleged that the prosecution 
had intentionally withheld these statements when providing documents 
under section 265-C Cr.P.C. on 01.02.2024. He claimed he had a right to 
have these statements and requested the Court’s intervention to ensure 
their copies were furnished to him. 
5. 
 
The Petitioner/NAB contested both applications, contending 
that Respondents No.1 & 2 had no right to have copies of the 
aforementioned statements.  
6. 
 
The Accountability Court accepted both applications by 
consolidated order dated 15.05.2024 (the “Impugned Order”). NAB has 
challenged that order before this Court through this petition under Article 
199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973  
(the “Constitution”). 
The submissions 
7. 
 
Mr. Waris Ali Janjua, Special Prosecutor for NAB, contends 
that the Impugned Order is perverse. He argues that it disregards key 
provisions of the NAO, particularly sections 24(b), 3, and 17, which 
prescribe a special procedure for filing references and conducting trials in 
Accountability Courts. He maintains that when a statute prescribes a 

Writ Petition No.48984/2024 
- 3 -
particular process for prosecuting an offence, it must be adhered to 
strictly. Mr. Janjua further argues that “inquiry” and “investigation” are 
distinct legal concepts. The NAO differentiates between these two stages, 
with an inquiry as a preliminary step to determine whether the case 
should proceed to investigation or be dropped. He submits that section 
265-C Cr.P.C. mandates only the provision of statements recorded during 
the investigation phase, not those recorded during the inquiry. He asserts 
that the Accountability Court overstepped its jurisdiction by ordering the 
supply of statements recorded during the inquiry phase. Mr. Janjua 
concludes that the Court’s failure to recognize this distinction has resulted 
in a miscarriage of justice and prays that the instant writ petition be 
accepted and the Impugned Order be set aside. 
8. 
 
The counsel for Respondent No.1, Mr. Muhammad Nawaz, 
Advocate, contends that Respondent No.1 is entitled to copies of the 
statements made by the approvers/witnesses, Azmat Hayat and Sohail 
Akram, before the grant of pardon, as these fall within the scope of 
“previous statements” under Article 140 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984 
(QSO). He asserts that the failure to provide copies of these statements 
not only violates the statutory provisions of section 265-C Cr.P.C. but 
also infringes upon the fundamental rights to treatment in accordance 
with the law, due process, life, liberty, and a fair trial, as guaranteed by 
the Constitution. 
9. 
 
The counsel for Respondent No.2, Mr. Amir Saeed Rawn, 
Advocate, contends that Article 10A of the Constitution guarantees the 
right to a fair trial, which includes the full disclosure of evidence. He 
argues that an accused cannot effectively defend against charges if all 
evidence gathered during the inquiry or investigation is not disclosed. In 
particular, the prosecution is obligated to disclose exculpatory material to 
the defence. Mr. Rawn asserts that, in this case, the previous statements 
of 11 persons requested by Respondent No.2 are crucial to his defence, 
and he would be seriously prejudiced if they were not provided to him. 
Opinion 
10. 
 
The NAO is a special law that aims “to eradicate corruption 
and corrupt practices and hold accountable all those persons accused of 

Writ Petition No.48984/2024 
- 4 -
such practices.”1 Sub-section (a) of section 17 of the NAO stipulates that, 
notwithstanding any other law in force, the provisions of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1898, shall apply mutatis mutandis to proceedings 
under NAO unless they are inconsistent with it. Sub-section (b) of section 
17 states that, subject to sub-section (a), the provisions of Chapter  
XXII-A of the Code2 shall apply to trials under the NAO. 
11. 
 
Section 265-C Cr.P.C. mandates that in all criminal cases, 
copies of statements and documents must be provided to the accused free 
of charge not later than seven days before the commencement of the trial. 
In the context of the present case, sub-section (1) of section 265-C is 
relevant and is reproduced below for ready reference: 
265-C. Supply of statements and documents to the accused.– (1) In 
all cases instituted upon police report, copies of the following 
documents shall be supplied free of cost to the accused not later than 
seven days before the commencement of the trial, namely: 
(a) 
the first information report; 
(b) 
the police report; 
(c) 
the statements of all witnesses recorded under sections 161 and 
164; and 
(d) 
the inspection note recorded by an investigating officer on his 
first visit to the place of occurrence and the note recorded by 
him on recoveries made, if any: 
 
Provided that, if any part of a statement recorded under section 
161 or section 164 is such that its disclosure to the accused would be 
inexpedient in the public interest, such part of the statement shall be 
excluded from the copy of the statement furnished to the accused. 
12. 
 
In Zulfikar Ali Bhutto v. The State (PLD 1979 SC 53), the 
Supreme Court held that where the police officer does not record the 
statement of a witness as required by section 161 Cr.P.C. but writes it in 
the diary maintained under section 172 Cr.P.C. (presumably as a 
statement of the circumstances ascertained through the investigation) its 
copy should also be given to the accused because it is to be reckoned as a 
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. 
13. 
 
The object of section 265-C Cr.P.C. is to enable the accused 
to know the evidence the prosecution will present against him at trial so 
that he may prepare his defence and is not taken by surprise. In 
Muhammad Riaz and another v. The State (PLD 2003 Lahore 290), a

2 This Chapter deals with trials before High Courts and Courts of Session.

Full Bench of this Court observed that this section was introduced to 
address the gap created by the abolition of commitment proceedings 
(Chapter XVIII of the Cr.P.C.) and enunciated the following principles: 
(a) 
The provisions of section 161, Cr.P.C. are independent of 
section 172 Cr.P.C. Section 161 requires an Investigating 
Officer to record statement of a person who is acquainted with 
the facts of the case separately and section 172 (which is 
independent) relates to maintenance of case diaries as record of 
the various stages through which the investigation has passed. 
It is only the case diaries which are meant to be treated as 
‘privileged’ and shall not be made accessible to the accused. It 
clearly means that the statements recorded under section 161 of 
the Cr.P.C. are not privileged even if recorded in the body of 
the case diaries. 
(b) 
Section 265-C(1)(c) Cr.P.C. has impliedly repealed section 162 
Cr.P.C. to the extent that it enjoins that when the prosecution 
produces a witness at the trial whose statement has been 
recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C., the court shall on the 
request of the accused direct that a copy thereof be provided to 
him [in order that any part of such statement, if duly proved, 
may be used to contradict the said witness in terms of section 
145 of the Evidence Act, 1872 (Article 140 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984)]. 
(c) 
The word “witnesses” appearing in section 265-C(1)(c) Cr.P.C. 
has been used in the broad sense. It covers all those persons 
who are acquainted with the circumstances of the case and are 
examined by the Investigating Officer during investigation. 
(d) 
The accused is entitled, as of right, to get copies of the 
statements of all the witnesses recorded under section 161 
Cr.P.C. irrespective of the fact whether they have been cited as 
witnesses in the calendar attached to the challan or not. 
(e) 
The statements of the witnesses and other documents 
mentioned in section 265-C Cr.P.C. must be supplied to the 
accused at least seven days before the commencement of the 
trial. 
(f) 
Section 265-C Cr.P.C. has no bearing on the question of 
admissibility of a document or the statement of a witness which 
is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Qanun-
e-Shahadat, 1984. 
14. 
 
The following two legal questions need to be answered 
before we address the issue raised in this case: 
I. 
Are the provisions of section 265-C Cr.P.C. 
exhaustive, and an accused cannot demand documents 
other than those specified therein? 
II. 
Is the prosecution obligated to disclose/turn over 
exculpatory evidence to the accused? 
 
 
We take up these questions seriatim. 

Writ Petition No.48984/2024

Question I 
15. 
 
The procedure outlined in Chapters XX and XXII-A of the 
Cr.P.C.3 ensures a fair trial not only for the accused but also for the 
prosecution and the complainant.4 Section 265-C, which falls under 
Chapter XXII-A, plays a vital role in this process by ensuring that the 
accused is fully informed of the prosecution’s case and provided with 
essential materials to prepare their defence, thereby preserving the 
integrity of the trial. While the supply of the listed documents is a 
mandatory legal requirement, the question whether the list is exhaustive 
must be considered in light of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the 
Constitution and broader principles of fairness. Section 265-C should be 
understood as providing the minimum essential materials for the accused 
to defend themselves and respond to the charges adequately. Courts must 
retain the discretion to order the disclosure of additional documents 
whenever necessary to uphold fairness and ensure that justice is served. 
16. 
 
Section 265-C Cr.P.C. must be read in conjunction with 
sections 94(1)5 and 265-F Cr.P.C.6 Section 94(1) allows the court to make 
an order for the production of any document if it is necessary or desirable 
for the trial. In Om Prakash Sharma v. Central Bureau of Investigation, 
Delhi (AIR 2000 SC 2335), while interpreting section 91 of the Indian 
                                         
3 Chapter XX pertains to the trial of cases by Magistrates, while Chapter XXII-A deals with trials 
conducted before High Courts and Courts of Session. 
4 Hakam Deen v. The State and  others [PLD 2006 SC (AJ & K) 43]. 
5 The relevant part of section 94(1) Cr.P.C. is reproduced below for ease of reference: 
94. Summons to produce document or other thing.– (1) Whenever any Court, or any officer 
incharge of a police-station considers that the production of any document or other thing is 
necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding 
under this Code by or before such Court or officer, such Court may issue a summons, or such 
officer a written order, to the person in whose possession or power such document or thing is 
believed to be, requiring him to attend and produce it, or to produce it, at the time and place 
stated in the summons or order: 
  
Provided that no such officer shall issue any such order requiring the production of 
any document or other thing which is in the custody of a bank or banker as defined in the 
Banker’s Books Evidence Act, 1891 (XVIII of 1891) and relates, or might disclose any 
information which relates to the bank account of any person except: 
(a) 
for the purpose of investigating an offence under sections 403, 406, 408 and 
409 and sections 421 to 424 (both inclusive) and sections 465 to 477-A (both 
inclusive) of the Pakistan Penal Code, with the prior permission in writing of 
a Sessions Judge; and 
(b) 
in other cases, with the prior permission in writing of the High Court. 
6 The relevant part of section 265-F Cr.P.C. reads as follows: 
265-F. Evidence for prosecution.– (7) If the accused or any one of several accused, after 
entering on his defence, applies to the Court to issue any process for compelling the attendance 
of any witness for examination or the production of any document or other thing, the Court 
shall issue such process unless it considers that the application is made for the purpose of 
vexation or delay or defeating the ends of justice such ground shall be recorded by the Court in 
writing. 

Writ Petition No.48984/2024

Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, which is pari materia with our section 
94 Cr.P.C., the Supreme Court of India held that the powers conferred 
under section 91 are discretionary and enabling in nature. The court 
should be allowed broad latitude in exercising this discretion, and higher 
courts should only intervene if the lower court’s decision is unreasonable 
or inconsistent with established judicial principles. 
17. 
 
The words “whenever” and “thing” in section 94 Cr.P.C. are 
significant. “Whenever” indicates that a court can exercise the power to 
require the production of any document or other thing at any stage during 
an inquiry or trial. The only condition is that it must be necessary or 
desirable for the proceedings. In The State v. Chaudhry Muhammad 
Usman (2023 SCMR 1676), the accused was facing trial for certain 
offences punishable under the Drugs Act 1976 and the Drug Regulatory 
Authority of Pakistan Act 2012. The Supreme Court of Pakistan 
considered the questions: (i) whether an accused can request the court, 
before the commencement of trial, to order the production of documents 
not covered under section 265-C Cr.P.C., and (ii) whether an accused can 
make such a request before presenting a defence, despite the existence of 
section 265-F(7) Cr.P.C., which provides that, after entering on his 
defence, an accused can apply to the trial court to issue any process for 
compelling the production of any document. The Supreme Court 
answered both questions in the affirmative. It ruled that any party may 
apply to the court for an order under section 94 Cr.P.C., which must allow 
its request if the condition mentioned above is satisfied (i.e., it is 
necessary or desirable for the proceedings). It clarified that section  
265-F(7) does not control or limit the power of a court under section 
94(1). “The provisions of these two sections differ from each other in 
their extent and scope. They are not opposed to each other. Section 94(1) 
affords both the parties to an inquiry or trial (not to the accused alone) the 
opportunity of causing the production of any document at any stage of 
such inquiry or trial, with the condition that the party applying for it must 
satisfy the court that the production of the required document is necessary 
or desirable for the purposes of the inquiry or trial. Section 265-F(7), on 
the other hand, only gives the accused another similar opportunity at the 
stage of his defence subject to a lesser condition, which is that his 

Writ Petition No.48984/2024 
- 8 -
application should not be for the purpose of vexation, delay, or defeating 
the ends of justice.” 
18. 
 
The principle of law that can be deduced from the above 
discussion is that while section 265-C Cr.P.C. mandates the supply of 
specific documents to the accused, the court may also direct the 
prosecution to produce additional materials not explicitly mentioned in 
the section, and let the accused have access to them. However, in each 
case, the court must first determine whether the documents the accused 
requests are necessary or desirable for the trial and would foster justice 
and fairness. Courts derive this authority from section 94(1) Cr.P.C., and 
Articles 4 and 10A of the Constitution, which obligate them to ensure that 
every accused is dealt with according to the law and receives a fair trial. 
Question II 
19. 
 
Exculpatory evidence is any information or material that is 
favourable to an accused in a criminal case. It can take many different 
forms. It could be direct evidence that points to the accused innocence, 
evidence that negates an element of the crime, evidence or information 
that undermines the credibility of prosecution witnesses, or evidence that 
reduces culpability or lessens the severity of the punishment. Exculpatory 
material can also encompass forensic evidence, surveillance footage, or 
investigative leads that suggest the involvement of other suspects/ 
offenders. 
20. 
 
The prosecution’s duty to disclose exculpatory evidence is 
fundamental to ensuring a fair trial and upholding the principles of natural 
justice. In an adversarial system, both the prosecution and the defence 
must have equal access to relevant evidence, with the prosecution bearing 
the responsibility not only to secure convictions but also to ensure justice. 
This includes disclosing evidence that may weaken its case if it serves the 
interests of truth and fairness. Given its vast resources and investigative 
machinery, the State wields more power than the average accused, 
particularly those with limited means. In many cases, the accused lacks 
the same level of legal expertise, investigative tools, or access to evidence 
that the prosecution possesses. This imbalance makes the disclosure of 
exculpatory evidence critical to ensuring a fair trial. Without such 

Writ Petition No.48984/2024 
- 9 -
disclosure, the accused may be deprived of essential information that 
could prove their innocence or weaken the prosecution’s case. 
Historically, failures to disclose exculpatory materials, whether through 
negligence or deliberate suppression, have resulted in numerous wrongful 
convictions and serious miscarriages of justice. 
21. 
 
In the United States, the prosecution’s duty to disclose 
exculpatory evidence is not just a procedural; it reflects the broader 
constitutional principle of due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth 
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The Amendment ensures that no 
individual shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without fair legal 
proceedings. In the context of a criminal trial, the suppression of 
exculpatory evidence violates this fundamental right by denying the 
accused a fair opportunity to present a complete defence. In Brady v. 
Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), the defence had requested extra-judicial 
statements made by Brady’s accomplice, Boblit, but they were not 
provided. At trial, Brady admitted his involvement in the killing but 
testified that Boblit had strangled the victim. This version was supported 
by one of Boblit’s confessions. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that 
suppressing Boblit’s statement violated Brady’s due process, noting that 
the statement had been requested and was “material”. The Court held that 
“the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused 
upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to 
guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the 
prosecution.” The Court affirmed the Maryland Court of Appeals’ 
decision, granting Brady a new sentencing hearing but not a new trial. It 
underscored that the goal of the criminal justice system is not just to 
convict but to ensure trials are fair and just, adding that a prosecutor 
should not be the “architect of a proceeding that does not comport with 
standards of justice.” 
22. 
 
Several cases have further refined and expanded the 
application of the principle established in Brady. In United States v. 
Agurs, 427 U.S. 97 (1976), the U.S. Supreme Court clarified that the 
prosecution’s duty to disclose exculpatory evidence applies even if the 
defence has not made a specific request for it. The Court identified three 
situations in which a Brady claim might arise: (a) when undisclosed 

Writ Petition No.48984/2024 
- 10 -
evidence shows that the prosecution introduced testimony it knew or 
should have known was perjured; (b) when the prosecution fails to 
comply with a defence request for specific exculpatory evidence; and  
(c) when the prosecution fails to disclose exculpatory evidence, where the 
defence either makes a request for exculpatory evidence (such as asking 
for “all Brady material” or “anything exculpatory”) or makes no request 
at all. The Court held that the prosecution’s duty applies in the third 
scenario only if suppressing the evidence would be “of sufficient 
significance to result in the denial of the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” 
The Court explained that the duty to disclose exculpatory evidence arises 
from its exculpatory nature, not from the specificity of the request. The 
Brady rule applies both before trial, when the prosecutor must decide 
what evidence to disclose voluntarily, and after trial, when a judge may 
need to assess whether non-disclosure deprived the defendant of due 
process. The same standard of materiality applies in both contexts: the 
prosecutor’s omission must be significant enough to affect the fairness of 
the trial. No constitutional violation requires the verdict to be set aside if 
it did not. 
23. 
 
In United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667 (1985), the U.S. 
Supreme Court held that the prosecution’s failure to disclose evidence 
that could be used to impeach government witnesses does not 
automatically require reversal of a conviction. Instead, the Court ruled 
that such non-disclosure constitutes a constitutional violation only if the 
withheld evidence is “material.” The standard of materiality requires a 
“reasonable probability” that, had the evidence been disclosed, the 
outcome of the trial would have been different. A “reasonable 
probability” is what is sufficient to undermine confidence in the trial’s 
outcome. This standard applies regardless of whether the defence made 
no request, a general request, or a specific request for the evidence. The 
Supreme Court clarified that even if the prosecution’s failure to respond 
fully to a specific request for exculpatory or impeachment evidence could 
impair the adversarial process, this impairment does not necessitate a 
different standard of materiality. Thus, the reviewing court can directly 
assess any adverse impact the non-disclosure may have had on the 
defence’s preparation or case presentation. Consequently, the Court 

Writ Petition No.48984/2024 
- 11 -
reversed the lower court’s decision, which had required automatic 
reversal for failing to disclose the impeachment evidence, and remanded 
the case for further determination based on the “reasonable probability” 
standard. 
24. 
 
In Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995), the Supreme Court 
emphasized four key aspects of materiality under Brady for determining 
when suppressed evidence violates due process. First, evidence is deemed 
material if there is a “reasonable probability” that its disclosure would 
have led to a different outcome in the trial, without requiring proof that it 
would have resulted in an acquittal. The focus is on whether the 
suppressed evidence could have reasonably affected the verdict. Second, 
the materiality test examines whether the undisclosed evidence would 
have cast the case in a different light and undermined confidence in the 
outcome rather than assessing whether the trial evidence was sufficient to 
convict. Third, once a constitutional violation is established under the 
Bagley materiality standard, no further harmless-error review is needed, 
as this standard is stricter than the harmless-error test. Finally, the 
prosecution’s disclosure obligation depends on the cumulative effect of 
all suppressed evidence favourable to the defence, not on an item-by-item 
analysis. The prosecutor, who alone may know what evidence is 
undisclosed, is responsible for evaluating the overall impact and 
disclosing it once the “reasonable probability” threshold is met. This duty 
remains, regardless of whether the police fail to inform the prosecutor 
about the existence of favourable evidence. 
25. 
 
Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263 (1999), once again 
highlighted the requirements for proving a violation of the Brady rule. In 
this case, the prosecution failed to disclose police notes and letters that 
could have been used to impeach a key witness’s credibility in a capital 
murder trial. The Supreme Court reaffirmed that to prove a Brady 
violation, the accused must demonstrate three elements: (i) the evidence 
was favourable to the accused, either because it was exculpatory or 
impeaching; (ii) the evidence was suppressed by the prosecution, either 
willfully or inadvertently; and (iii) prejudice resulted, meaning there was 
a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different if the 
evidence had been disclosed. The Court concluded that although Strickler 

Writ Petition No.48984/2024 
- 12 -
showed cause for not raising the claim earlier, the suppressed evidence 
was not material enough to undermine confidence in the verdict, given 
the weight of the other evidence presented at trial. 
26. 
 
In Smith v. Cain, 565 U.S. 73 (2012), the state did not 
dispute that the eyewitness’s statements were favourable to Smith and 
were not disclosed to him. The Supreme Court held that, under Brady, 
evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that, had the 
evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been 
different. A “reasonable probability” means that the likelihood of a 
different result is great enough to undermine confidence in the trial’s 
outcome. Evidence impeaching an eyewitness’s testimony may not be 
material if the state’s other evidence is strong enough to sustain 
confidence in the verdict. In this case, the eyewitness’s testimony was the 
only evidence linking Smith to the crime, and the undisclosed statements 
contradicted his testimony. Thus, the eyewitness’s statements were 
material, and the state’s failure to disclose them to the defence violated 
Brady.  
27. 
 
Turner v. United States (2017)7 dealt with a group of 
accused convicted of murder. The prosecution had failed to disclose 
several pieces of evidence, including witness statements that might have 
exonerated the accused or cast doubt on the prosecution’s theory. 
Although the Court ruled that the suppressed evidence was not material in 
this case, Turner reaffirmed the importance of disclosure and 
demonstrated that the materiality of undisclosed evidence remains crucial 
in determining whether a Brady violation has occurred. 
28. 
 
Based on the case law discussed, the principles regarding the 
disclosure of exculpatory material in the United States may be 
summarized as follows: 
(i) 
The prosecution’s duty to disclose exculpatory evidence applies 
even if the defence does not request it. 
(ii) 
The evidence must be disclosed in time for the defence to use it 
effectively at trial or sentencing. While the exact timing of disclosure 
is not rigidly defined, exculpatory evidence must be provided early 
enough for the defence to prepare adequately. Late disclosures that 
hinder the defence’s ability to prepare may constitute a Brady 
violation.

(iii) 
The prosecution is responsible for disclosing not only evidence 
in its possession but also evidence held by other government agencies, 
such as the police. 
(iv) 
Materiality is central to determining whether a Brady violation 
has occurred. Courts assess whether there is a “reasonable probability” 
that the suppression of evidence undermines confidence in the trial’s 
outcome. 
(v) 
Evidence that could impeach the credibility of a key witness 
must also be disclosed, as it is considered exculpatory if it could affect 
the jury’s perception of the witness’s reliability. 
29. 
 
In the U.K., the disclosure principle is governed by several 
statutes, with the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CPIA) 
at its core. The CPIA establishes a framework where the prosecution is 
required to disclose material that could either assist the defence or 
undermine the prosecution’s case. This obligation applies not only at the 
outset of the trial but also continuously throughout the proceedings, 
meaning that any new evidence discovered after the initial disclosure 
must be shared with the defence. 
30. 
 
The U.K. legal system operates on several key principles. 
First, the duty of initial disclosure requires the prosecution to provide 
material that could undermine its case or reasonably assist the defence. 
This does not necessarily cover all evidence the prosecution intends to 
use in court, but only that which meets the statutory test for disclosure. 
Second, the duty of continuing disclosure ensures that this obligation 
extends beyond the initial phase. The prosecution must continuously 
review the case for additional material relevant to the defence and 
promptly disclose it. The standard for disclosing unused material in the 
U.K. is broader than in the U.S. It focuses on whether it might reasonably 
assist the defence or weaken the prosecution’s case rather than strictly on 
whether it would affect the trial’s outcome. 
31. 
 
Under the CPIA, the defence is also required to submit a 
defence statement outlining its strategy and any legal issues it plans to 
raise. This helps the prosecution identify relevant exculpatory material. 
However, the prosecution’s obligation to disclose exculpatory material 
remains, even if the defence does not submit a statement. The disclosure 
process is subject to judicial oversight, with judges empowered to 
intervene if there are disputes or the prosecution fails to fulfill its 
disclosure duties. The CPIA also mandates the use of “disclosure

officers” in police forces, who are responsible for identifying, retaining, 
and organizing evidence and ensuring that no exculpatory material is 
overlooked. 
32. 
 
The consequences of non-disclosure can be serious, 
potentially leading to outcomes such as the exclusion of evidence, 
dismissal of charges, or the overturning of convictions. U.K. courts have 
taken a strict stance on this issue, recognizing that non-disclosure of 
exculpatory evidence can result in miscarriages of justice. For instance, in 
R v. Ward [1993] 1 WLR 619, the non-disclosure of scientific evidence 
that could have exonerated the accused ultimately led to the quashing of 
the conviction. 
33. 
 
In recent years, the U.K. has re-examined its disclosure 
process, particularly after several high-profile wrongful convictions and 
trials that collapsed due to non-disclosure of crucial evidence. A notable 
example is the 2017 case of Liam Allan, a university student wrongfully 
accused of rape. In this case, the prosecution failed to disclose text 
messages from the complainant, which ultimately proved Allan’s 
innocence. The case was dropped after the evidence surfaced, but it 
brought widespread criticism of the U.K.’s disclosure practices and 
sparked calls for reform. 
34. 
 
As a result of cases like Allan, the Crown Prosecution 
Service (CPS) and police forces introduced new guidelines and 
procedures aimed at improving compliance with disclosure obligations. In 
2018, the Attorney General published a review of disclosure practices and 
recommended enhancing training, increasing resources for police and 
prosecutors, and promoting a culture of openness and transparency in 
criminal investigations. 
35. 
 
While the U.K. does not follow the U.S. Brady rule, it has 
developed a robust legal framework under the Criminal Procedure and 
Investigations Act 1996 (CPIA) for ensuring the disclosure of exculpatory 
evidence. The CPIA and subsequent guidelines place a clear 
responsibility on prosecutors to ensure that material relevant to the 
defence is promptly and comprehensively disclosed.

In Pakistan, Article 4(1) of the Constitution mandates that to 
enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law is the 
inalienable right of every citizen, wherever he may be, and of every other 
person for the time being in Pakistan. Historically, Article 4 has been 
regarded through judicial interpretation as embodying the principles of 
due process. However, with the 18th Amendment, Article 10A was 
formally introduced, guaranteeing the right to a fair trial and due process. 
It stipulates: “For the determination of his civil rights and obligations or 
in any criminal charge against him a person shall be entitled to a fair trial 
and due process.” Article 10A not only consolidated the procedural 
protections available to citizens but also explicitly recognized the 
importance of fairness in determining civil rights and criminal charges. 
37. 
 
The concept of a fair trial is rooted in justice, where both the 
prosecution and the defence should have equal access to all relevant 
information. Articles 4 and 10A create a constitutional framework that 
demands transparency and fairness in criminal proceedings. The State, 
through the prosecution, cannot selectively present evidence that supports 
its case while withholding material that might assist the defence. Courts 
in Pakistan, in line with international legal standards, have recognized 
that the prosecution must act fairly, which includes an obligation to 
disclose any evidence that may help the defence. Reference in this regard 
may be made to Sharjeel Inam Memon and others v. National 
Accountability Bureau and others (2018 PCr.LJ Note 34), Mustafa 
Jamal Kazi and others v. National Accountability Bureau and others 
(2019 YLR 650), and Muhammad Safdar v. Presiding Officer, 
Accountability Court No. IV, Karachi, and others (2020 PCr.LJ 683).  
The case at hand 
38. 
 
Respondents No. 1 & 2 filed two separate applications 
before the Accountability Court seeking copies of the statements of 
prosecution witnesses. Respondent No.1 stated that Mahar Azmat Hayat 
and Sohail Akram were among the accused when the NAB initiated 
proceedings and joined the inquiry as such. Later, they were granted 
pardons, became approvers, and were listed as prosecution witnesses in 
the Reference. Respondent No. 2, on the other hand, requested copies of 

Writ Petition No.48984/2024 
- 16 -
the statements of 11 persons, including Mahar Azmat Hayat, recorded 
during the inquiry. NAB’s primary contention is that the NAO 
distinguishes between “inquiry” and “investigation” and that section  
265-C Cr.P.C., read with sections 3, 17, and 24(b) of the NAO, mandates 
the provision of copies only of the statements recorded under section 161 
Cr.P.C. during the investigation phase, not during the inquiry. 
40. 
 
There is no cavil that “inquiry” and “investigation” are two 
separate concepts. The Black’s Law Dictionary defines “inquiry” as  
“(a) a question someone asks to elicit information; (b) the act or process 
of posing questions to elicit information.”8 On the other hand, it describes 
“investigation” as “the activity of trying to find out the truth about 
something, such as a crime, accident, or historical issue; esp., either an 
authoritative inquiry into certain facts, as by a legislative committee, or a 
systematic examination of some intellectual problem or empirical 
question, as by mathematical treatment or use of the scientific method.”9 
According to the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, “inquiry” 
signifies “a solicitation for information”, while “investigate” denotes “the 
comprehensive exploration and scrutiny of all facts surrounding a 
particular event, such as a crime or an accident, with the objective of 
ascertaining the truth.”10 The Code defines the two terms in section 4(1) 
as follows:  
(k)  
“Inquiry”.– “Inquiry” includes every inquiry other than a trial 
conducted under this Code by a Magistrate or Court.  
(l) 
“Investigation”.– “Investigation” includes all the proceedings 
under this Code for the collection of evidence conducted by a 
police officer or by any person (other than a Magistrate) who is 
authorized by a Magistrate in this behalf.  
41. 
 
Legal precedents also acknowledge the distinction between 
inquiry and investigation. In Muhammad Bilal Nawaz v. Director 
General, Federal Investigation Agency, and others (2024 LHC 3288), 
this Court held:  
 
“In summary, ‘inquiry’ and ‘investigation’ are distinct processes within 
legal proceedings, each serving specific purposes. An inquiry refers to 
a preliminary examination or fact-finding process conducted by a 
designated authority or agency to gather information regarding a

particular matter. It aims to assess the situation and determine whether 
further legal action is warranted. Inquiries vary in scope and formality, 
ranging from informal discussions to formal hearings. On the other 
hand, an investigation involves a detailed examination of a specific 
matter or allegation to gather evidence and determine its truth or 
validity. Investigations are conducted by law enforcement agencies or 
authorized entities to collect evidence, identify suspects, and gather 
information for legal proceedings. Although both procedures entail 
scrutinizing facts and evidence, inquiries are preliminary, primarily 
focusing on information gathering. In contrast, investigations are more 
thorough and structured, geared explicitly towards accumulating 
evidence to support legal action.”11  
42. 
 
The NAO also recognizes the distinction between inquiry 
and investigation. Section 18(c) of the NAO stipulates that when the 
Chairman of NAB, or an officer duly authorized by him, deems it 
necessary and appropriate to initiate proceedings against a person, he 
shall first refer the matter for inquiry. If, upon completion of the inquiry, 
the allegations of an offense under the Ordinance are substantiated with 
material evidence, the matter shall be converted into an investigation.  
43. 
 
Section 18(g) of the NAO is another provision pointing to 
the aforementioned distinction. It states that the Chairman NAB, or an 
authorized officer, must evaluate the material and evidence gathered 
during the inquiry and the investigation. If they determine that it would be 
just and proper to proceed further and there is sufficient material to justify 
the filing of a reference, he shall refer the matter to a court. 
44. 
 
Even though “inquiry” and “investigation” are distinct legal 
concepts, they are interconnected. Both stages are crucial in legal 
procedures, and findings from an inquiry often lead to an investigation. 
Under the NAO, while inquiry and investigation are separate stages 
preceding the filing of a reference, they are inherently linked. An inquiry 
is the first step, which may lead to the second step, i.e., investigation, and 
then to the final step, i.e., the preparation and filing of a reference against 
the accused.  
45. 
 
In general, the accused is not automatically entitled to all the 
evidence collected during an inquiry, especially in cases where the 
inquiry is preliminary and has not led to formal charges or an 
investigation. However, once an investigation has been initiated and

(1989 PCr.LJ 1921).

charges are brought, the accused typically has the right to access the 
evidence against them to prepare an effective defence. This principle is 
rooted in the right to a fair trial and due process, which is guaranteed by 
Article 10A of the Constitution. It is significant that the proviso to section 
18(c) of the NAO mandates that the inquiry report shall be provided to 
the accused. The “report” would include all the evidence, including the 
statements of witnesses, on which it is based. Therefore, the accused is 
entitled to receive the inquiry report and the underlying evidence as a 
constitutional and statutory right.  
46. 
 
NAB’s reliance on section 265-C Cr.P.C. to refuse to 
provide the statements of the witnesses recorded during the inquiry to 
Respondents No. 1 & 2 is misconceived for various reasons. First, section 
265-C Cr.P.C. cannot restrict the right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article 
10A of the Constitution. Second, the proviso to section 18(c) of the NAO 
explicitly mandates that the NAB must provide the inquiry report to the 
accused if the inquiry is converted into an investigation. We have held 
that the “report” includes all evidence, such as witness statements, on 
which it is based. Section 265-C Cr.P.C. is a general law. It cannot 
override the NAO, which is a special law. In fact, section 3 of the NAO 
provides that the provisions of this Ordinance shall have effect 
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in 
force. Thirdly, Respondents No.1 & 2 are entitled to the requested 
statements under section 94 Cr.P.C. (Refer to Chaudhry Muhammad 
Usman’s case). Lastly, the said statements fall within the category of 
“previous statements” mentioned in Article 140 of the QSO.12 Section 
162 Cr.P.C. states: “When any witness is called for the prosecution in 
such inquiry or trial whose statement has been reduced into writing as 
aforesaid the court shall, on the request of the accused, refer to such 
writing and direct that the accused be furnished with a copy thereof, in 
order that any part of such statement, if duly proved, may be used to 
contradict such witness in the manner provided by section 145 of the 
Evidence Act, 1872 (Read: Article 140 of the QSO). When any part of 
such statement is so used, any part thereof may also be used in the  
                                         
12 Section 145 of the Evidence Act 1872.

re-examination of such witness, but for the purpose only of explaining 
any matter referred to in his cross-examination.” 
47. 
 
Mr. Rawn contended that the NAB is reluctant to provide the 
above-mentioned previous statements of the witnesses to Respondents 
No.1 & 2 because they have exculpatory material. We need not go into 
this controversy at this stage. Suffice it to say that, in light of the law 
discussed above, NAB cannot withhold exculpatory evidence from the 
accused. 
48. 
 
We have noted that NAB is particularly reluctant to provide 
the earlier statements of Mahr Azmat Hayat and Sohail Akram, which 
they made before becoming approvers. It cannot withhold them in view 
of the law settled in Hazara Singh and others v. Emperor  
(AIR 1928 Lah 257). Speaking for Court, Dalip Singh, J. said: 
“The first point taken by Mr. Iftikhar Ali was that the learned Sessions 
Judge had refused to allow the accused the statement made by the 
approver to the police before he was tendered a pardon. The learned 
Sessions Judge held that this statement was made by the approver as an 
accused person and not as a witness, and that, therefore s. 162, 
Criminal P.C., did not apply to the case. In my opinion the case is 
covered by S. 162, but even if the learned Sessions Judge were correct 
in holding that this statement was not within S. 162, Criminal P.C., it 
would be a previous statement of a witness and it could be used either 
to corroborate him or to contradict him under the ordinary provisions 
of the Evidence Act. Counsel for the Crown has relied on S. 172, 
Criminal P. C., as barring this statement. I do not think that S. 172 
applies in any way to the statements of persons, and certainly does not 
override the provisions of the Evidence Act. I, therefore, think that the 
statement should not have been refused in evidence. In these 
circumstances we hold that counsel should be furnished with a copy of 
the statement and any contradictions between this statement and those 
made in Court by the approver should be taken as left unexplained by 
the approver.” 
49. 
 
In view of the above, we have dismissed this petition, with 
costs of Rs.200,000/- by our short order dated 21.08.2024. These are the 
reasons for our decision.
