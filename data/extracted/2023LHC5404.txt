Muhammad Afzal  versus  Asia Zaheer   
 
 
J U D G M E N T 
Date of Hearing: 
04.10.2023 
Petitioner by: 
Mr. Mubashar Iqbal, Advocate.  
Respondent by: 
Mian Tariq Mehmood, Advocate.  
Anwaar Hussain, J.  This petition under Section 115, Code 
of Civil Procedure, 1908 arises out of the suit for specific 
performance of agreement to sell dated 31.08.2020 (“the 
agreement”) instituted by the petitioner against the respondent that 
was dismissed by the Trial Court, vide judgment and decree dated 
26.04.2022 and the said finding was upheld, vide judgment and 
decree dated 07.11.2022, by the Additional District Judge, 
Faisalabad. Both the Courts below allowed the respondent to forfeit 
the earnest money paid by the petitioner under the agreement.  
2. 
Mian Tariq Mehmood, Advocate has entered appearance on 
behalf of the respondent at the limine stage with permission of the 
Court. His power of attorney is also available on record, having 
been filed in the Office on 09.06.2023. With the consent of learned 
counsel for the parties, the case has been heard and decided as a 
pacca case.    
3. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
petitioner instituted a suit, against the respondent, for specific 
performance of the agreement with the averments that the 
respondent agreed to sell his house measuring 2 marla 4 ½ sq. ft., 
situated in Tehsil City, District Faisalabad (“the suit property”),

detail whereof is given in para 2 of the plaint, for total price 
consideration of Rs.2,575,000/-, out of which a sum of Rs.650,000/- 
was paid as earnest money whereas the remaining amount was 
agreed to be paid on or before 01.01.2021. It was also agreed that 
the respondent shall get a gas meter installed at the suit property. 
The Trial Court directed the petitioner to deposit the balance sale 
consideration amounting to Rs.1,925,000/-, however, the petitioner 
only deposited a sum of Rs.1,800,000/- and withheld Rs.125,000/-, 
apparently, on account of non-installation of the gas meter, at the 
suit property, as per the agreement. The respondent after filing of 
the written statement was proceeded against ex-parte. The Trial 
Court recorded ex-parte evidence and finally dismissed the suit 
with the observation that the earnest money has been rightly 
forfeited by the respondent, inter alia, on the ground that the 
petitioner was bound to pay the remaining balance price till the cut-
off date, under the agreement, i.e., 01.01.2021 and despite issuance 
of fard proforma (Exh.P2) for the execution of the registered sale 
deed in his favour, he has neither paid the entire balance amount to 
the respondent nor tendered the same in the Court despite passing 
of order by the Trial Court, therefore, he has committed breach of 
contract and is not entitled to specific performance thereof.  
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the concurrent 
findings are result of mis-appreciation of record as also the 
applicable law, inter alia, for the reason that installation of the gas 
utility connection, at the suit property, was also one of the essential 
conditions of the agreement which admittedly, the respondent failed 
to discharge, therefore, breach of terms and conditions of the 
agreement lies on part of the respondent that has not been 
appreciated by the Courts below. Adds that this was also the precise 
reason for withholding Rs.125,000/- while depositing the balance 
sale price in compliance with the direction of the Trial Court.

Further avers that forthwith deposit of Rs.1,800,000/- upon the 
direction of the Trial Court indicates that the petitioner was always 
ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. Concludes that 
if the respondent was not willing to discharge his obligation to 
actualize the sale transaction, the agreement could have been struck 
off, however, it is a harsh decision to allow the respondent to forfeit 
substantial amount which the petitioner paid as earnest money at 
the time of execution of the agreement and prays that the same be 
returned to the petitioner.  
5. 
Conversely, on a pointed question whether the respondent is 
willing to sell the house and can ensure installation of the gas 
connection, as per the agreement, learned counsel for the 
respondent submits that the respondent is not willing to sell the suit 
property to the petitioner even if the sale price is enhanced by this 
Court. Further submits that the petitioner is always at liberty to 
withdraw amount of Rs.1,800,000/- deposited with the Trial Court 
as held by the Courts below, however, the earnest money was liable 
to be forfeited in terms of the agreement as the petitioner committed 
breach by failing to pay the balance consideration price by the cut-
off date and the Courts below have rightly held in this regard, in 
favour of the respondent.   
6. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
7. 
This case has simple and admitted facts. The respondent is 
owner of the suit property and while agreeing to sell the suit 
property through the agreement and receiving Rs.650,000/- as 
earnest money, also undertook that he shall get the gas meter 
installed in the suit property, which was not fulfilled by the 
respondent. The agreement reads as under:

When the petitioner approached the Trial Court for specific 
performance of the agreement, he was directed to deposit the total 
balance consideration price, however, he has withheld a sum of 
Rs.125,000/- from the balance sale price, on the ground that since 
an important stipulation regarding installation of the gas meter was 
not fulfilled by the respondent, the petitioner was justified to 
withhold the said amount as the respondent was obligated to 
handover possession of the suit property after getting the gas meter 
installed but the needful was not done even though a legal notice, to 
this effect, was issued to the respondent. When confronted with as 
to why the gas meter was not got installed as per the agreement, 
learned counsel for the respondent contends that there was a ban 
imposed on issuance/approval of gas utility connection by M/s Sui 
Northern Gas Pipeline Corporation Limited (“the SNGPL”), 
therefore, the needful could not be done.  
8. 
The only point of determination that requires opinion of this 
Court is to examine whether the respondent is justified in forfeiting 
the advance amount/earnest money as the petitioner failed to pay 
the balance amount of consideration before the cut-off date and 
despite direction of the Trial Court to pay balance sale 
consideration of Rs.1,925,000/- withheld Rs.125,000/- out of the 
same, keeping in view the fact that installation of a gas meter was 
also an agreed term under the agreement, which the respondent 
admittedly failed to meet till date.

9. 
In the course of a sale transaction, the earnest money paid by 
the vendee is part of the purchase price when the transaction 
successfully goes through and is forfeited if and when the 
transaction falls through, by reason of the fault or failure of the 
vendee to pay the balance sale price on or before the cut-off date 
and in this regard the parties do include a stipulation in the sale 
contracts. The agreement, in the instant case, contains such a 
stipulation. However, at the same time, there was a condition in the 
agreement that the respondent would get installed the gas meter in 
the suit property, which remained unfulfilled by the respondent. 
Record depicts that the petitioner came forth to perform his part of 
reciprocal obligation to pay the balance sale consideration within 
period stipulated, through issuance of a legal notice calling upon the 
respondent to comply with term of the agreement pertaining to the 
installation of the gas meter. It has been noted that right from the 
inception of the execution of the agreement, the respondent failed to 
comply with the reciprocal obligation under of the agreement to get 
installation of the gas meter. Inclusion of the said condition in the 
agreement indicates that the petitioner was interested in purchasing 
the suit property with the gas meter installed therein and in the 
absence of the same, certainly the value of the suit property cannot 
be the same as agreed between the parties.  
10. 
Admittedly, the gas meter has not been installed as of today 
and the respondent is not willing to discharge that obligation even if 
sale price is enhanced. One cannot lose sight of the fact that 
generally the agreements to sell do not contain a clause whereby it 
is stipulated that gas meter/connection shall be got installed by the 
seller, rather, the sales are made with the amenities/facilities like 
electricity or water connections, at the site/property, existing on the 
date of execution of an agreement. The incorporation of the said 
clause in itself indicates the intention of the parties that the said

term was material in reaching the consensus ad idem. Therefore, it 
runs counter to equitable principles to penalize the petitioner for 
failure of the respondent to fulfil material term of the agreement. 
Moreover, allowing forfeiture of the earnest money in favour of the 
respondent belies logic as this would amount to putting premium on 
failure of the respondent to fulfil his part of the agreement what 
seems to be material term thereof by the respondent himself. The 
Trial Court while thrashing out the evidentiary resume of the case 
has held that condition of installation of gas meter was not 
mandatory as no consequence thereof was stipulated for the non-
installation ignoring the following part of the agreement:   
’’
 رار اہلہم
 
رقی اول ےن ارحنا  ای اٹل اف
ہ
رقی اول و وارا لن ف
ہ
ارگ ف  ذہا یک یس یھ طر  ےس فرحن  وہا وت ووصل دش
رقی دومئ و ادا ہرکےن ا ا لدنب وہ اگ۔
ہ

(Emphasis supplied)
 
The phrase 
’
 کسی بھی شرط سے منحرف
ہوا‘
includes the installation of 
the gas meter by the respondent and consequence thereof is also 
stipulated by obligation of the respondent to pay double the amount 
in the above quoted part of the agreement. 
11. 
There is yet another dimension of the matter that also goes to 
the root of the case as well, having direct bearing on the nub of the 
matter, i.e., forfeiture of the earnest money. Learned counsel for the 
respondent has put forth the defence that gas meter could not be 
installed at the suit property because of the ban imposed by M/s 
SNGPL. On a pointed question, learned counsel for the respondent 
acknowledged that the ban was imposed after the cut-off date 
envisaged under the agreement. The respondent incorporated the 
condition of installation of gas meter when admittedly there was no 
ban imposed and no effort was made to get it installed and now that 
the ban has been imposed by M/s SNGPL, refuge is being taken 
before this Court on ground of imposition of ban. Meaning thereby 

 
 
 
 
 
Civil Revision No.5252/2023

that incorporation of the stipulation in respect of the installation of 
gas meter appears to be a promise without intent to perform the 
same and hence, amounts to fraud as contemplated under Sub-
Section (3) of Section 17 of the Contract Act, 1872 (“the Act, 
1872”), which reads as under:  
“17. “Fraud” defined. – “Fraud” means and 
includes any of the following acts committed by a 
party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his 
agent, with intent to deceive another party thereto or 
his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract –  
(1) 
… 
(2) 
… 
(3) 
a promise made without any intention of 
performing it.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
Under Section 19 of the Act, 1872, if the agreement is based on 
fraud, the same is held to be voidable at the option of aggrieved 
person and from this perspective, it is the petitioner who is the 
aggrieved party and can seek the performance of the contract and/or 
avoid the same and in fact recover damages. 
12. 
The above discussion raises a supplemental question that if 
the respondent is held to be in violation of his part of the agreement 
i.e., installation of gas meter, then whether the petitioner can be 
denied passing of decree of specific performance of the agreement 
in his suit. However, this is not apt so to consider for two fold 
reasons. Firstly, because the specific performance has been also 
denied on account of dereliction of petitioner to comply with the 
order of the Trial Court to deposit the total balance sale 
consideration, by withholding Rs.125,000/-. Secondly, during the 
course of arguments, learned counsel for the petitioner himself 
conceded that the petitioner would be satisfied if the impugned 
judgments are modified to the extent of forfeiture of the earnest

money, therefore, further analysis of the matter is not necessary. 
However, in view of the above discussion, this Court cannot shut its 
eyes upon the conduct of the respondent who admittedly agreed to 
get the gas meter installed in the suit property but did not honour 
his word, therefore, the respondent is not entitled to forfeit the 
earnest money of Rs.650,000/- paid by the petitioner to the 
respondent at the time of execution of the agreement, which aspect 
of the matter has gone unnoticed by the Courts below while passing 
the impugned judgments and decrees. 
13. 
For what has been discussed above, the impugned judgments 
and decrees are maintained to extent of dismissal of the suit of the 
petitioner for specific performance, however, are modified to the 
extent that the petitioner is entitled to forthwith return of the earnest 
money of Rs.650,000/- by the respondent, which was undisputedly 
paid by him to the respondent at the time of execution of the 
agreement.  
14. 
Disposed of in above terms.
