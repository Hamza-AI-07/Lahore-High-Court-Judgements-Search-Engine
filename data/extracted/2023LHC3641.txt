3. 
An inquiry under the PEEDA Act was initiated and 
conducted against the above-named officers on the charge of 
misconduct, financial misappropriation and inefficiency by the 
Inquiry Committee constituted under the orders of General 
Manager (Ops-II)/Competent Authority. Consequently, charge 
of financial misappropriation stood proved against the 
Petitioner and Ms. Shazia Fazal while that of misconduct and 

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022 
                        -3- 
 
inefficiency were proved against Ms. Sumaira Shiraz, 
Instructor, whereas Muhammad Rizwan, Assistant Manager 
(Finance) was declared innocent. The Inquiry Committee 
recommended that recovery of an amount of Rs.415,275/- be 
made from Ms. Shazia Fazal and five years of her past service 
be forfeited; recommended withholding of two increments for a 
period of two years and fine of one basic pay against Ms. 
Sumaira Shiraz; further the Petitioner was not only 
recommended to be removed from her service, but recovery of 
Rs.3,669,000/- was also recommended to be made from her, out 
of which she deposited an amount of Rs.1,80,000/-. Resultantly, 
show cause cum personal hearing notice dated 12.01.2021 was 
issued to all the accused officers, however, except Petitioner all 
the remaining three officials had appeared and were heard. 
Thereafter, petitioner was sent show cause notice dated 
26.01.2021 and lastly final show cause notice dated 04.02.2021, 
but she did not appear. Vide order dated 04.03.2021, the 
General Manager (OPS-II)/the Competent Authority, after 
having gone through the record, modified the recommended 
imposition of penalties, wherein penalty of petitioner’s 
dismissal from service was ordered. The Petitioner preferred an 
appeal challenging the aforementioned order dated 04.03.2021 
and, for having its pending appeal decided, she filed Writ 
Petition No.3268 of 2021 as well. Later, in compliance of 
direction by the this Court, the Petitioner was afforded an 
opportunity of hearing and eventually her Appeal was disposed 
of vide order dated 28.03.2022 by the Senior Director General, 
TEVTA/Appellate Authority further directing District Director 
TEVTA 
Jhelum 
and 
Chakwal 
for 
initiating 
criminal 
proceedings against her for recovery of stolen amount of 
Rs.3,669,000/-. Hence this Petition. 
4. 
It is contended by learned counsel for the Petitioner that 
the Petitioner was appointed as Accounts Clerk at Government 
Vocational Training Institute for Women (GVTIW) Chakwal 
on 20th of November, 2006 in BPS-5 and was subsequently 

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022 
                        -4- 
 
upgraded to BPS-11; that she along with three others were 
charged with allegation of embezzlement/misappropriation of 
money; that while probing into the matter, the Petitioner has 
been dismissed from service illegally and unlawfully under the 
orders of an incompetent authority i.e. General Manager 
(Operations) while this power was vested with the District 
Manager being appointing authority of the Petitioner; that 
Petitioner filed Writ Petitions No.571 of 2021 and 573 of 2021 
for 
having 
complete 
record 
qua 
proceedings/inquiries 
conducted against her as well as challenging the show cause 
notice issued to her but, despite her hectic efforts and issuance 
of direction by this Court vide order dated 15.02.2021, the 
respondents did not provide her the demanded record rather she 
was intimated by sending an E-mail to visit respondents’ office 
and peruse the record; that without providing the entire record 
to the Petitioner, she was dismissed from service; that not only 
the relevant record was not provided to the  Petitioner, but 
regular inquiry was not conducted against her as well no 
opportunity of cross-examination was afforded to her, yet she 
was illegally dismissed from service; that first inquiry was 
constituted under Section 9 of the Punjab Employees Efficiency 
Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006 (PEEDA Act) against 
the charges that she deliberately misplaced, hide and tampered 
with official record; unauthorizedly withdraw money from the 
bank with fake signatures, thus not only caused financial loss 
but also damaged the worth and fame of the department; that on 
conducting first inquiry against the Petitioner no charge of 
embezzlement was proved except commission of certain 
irregularity, therefore, the Inquiry Committee rightly held that 
no penalty can be imposed upon her under the PEEDA Act, 
2006; that Sections 10(6) and 13(3) of the Act have been 
violated and in the first inquiry corruption charges could not be 
proved against the Petitioner, therefore, she should have been 
absolved from the charges and should have been exonerated, 
instead; a second inquiry was initiated against her including 

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022 
                        -5- 
 
three others (who were also held responsible for commission of 
alleged fraud in the first inquiry report) vide order dated 
24.02.2020 by adding fresh charges; that second inquiry on the 
same charges was initiated against the Petitioner which is 
against the norms settled by the apex Court placing reliance on 
JAN MUHAMMAD Versus THE GENERAL MANAGER, 
KARACHI TELECOMMUNICATION REGION, KARACHI 
and another (1993 SCMR 1440); that the appellate authority 
had no power to enhance the punishment in any manner and 
order dated 28.03.2022 is liable to be set aside and in this 
regard the learned counsel has leaned upon SECRETARY, 
GOVERNMENT 
OF 
PUNJAB 
(C 
& 
W) 
Versus 
IKRAMULLAH  and 5 others (2013 SCMR 572), gist whereof 
is that where a competent authority proposed to enhance the 
penalty, it had to give reasons germane to the charges levelled 
and the evidence collected during inquiry and that too with 
reference to the liability of each of the officials who were 
inquired into; that full-fledged inquiry proceedings had 
concluded with the observations that “inquiry committee” 
cannot impose penalty under Section 10(6) of the Act and it 
nowhere mentioned that de novo inquiry is required to be 
conducted against the Petitioner; that allegations against the 
Petitioner of her having put fake signatures on the cheques and 
that she might have used the withdrawn amount is totally based 
on presumptions of the respondent-authority; that at the initial 
stage of inquiry, exerting undue pressure upon her, five signed 
cheques of different amounts were obtained from her by the 
respondent authority despite the fact that she was charged 
against the amount of Rs.3,669,000/-. Lastly, petitioner’s 
learned counsel prayed for setting aside of orders dated 
04.03.2021 and 28.03.2022. 
5. 
Respondents No. 1 to 3 submitted Report and Parawise 
comments on behalf of the TEVTA while Respondent No.4 on 
behalf of Anti-corruption office Chakwal.  

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022 
                        -6- 
 
6. 
It is argued and narrated in the Parawise comments that 
against the aforementioned ten allegations, the inquiry 
proceedings were initiated against the Petitioner and three 
accomplices and following penalties were imposed against each 
mentioned below:- 
(1) 
Ms. Shazia Fazil Mihas, 
Principal, GVTIW 
Recovery of an amount of Rs.415,275 
and forfeiture of past service for 
period of five years. 
(2) 
Mr. Muhammad Ramzan, 
Assistant 
Manager 
Finance/DDO Chakwal 
Exonerated 
(3) 
Ms. 
Sumaira 
Shiraz, 
Instructor, 
Co-signatory, 
GVTIW. 
Withholding of tow increments for a 
period of two years and a fine of one 
basic pay 
(4) 
Mr. Samra Gull, Accounts 
Clerk, GVTIW 
Removal from service; Recovery of 
an amount of Rs.3,669,000/- out of 
which she deposited an amount of 
Rs.1,80,000/- in lieu of recovery. 
 
Contentions of respondents are that the Petitioner filed 
departmental appeal before the Senior Director General/the 
Appellate Authority and thereafter filed Writ Petition No.3268 
of 2021, which was disposed of with a direction to Respondent 
No.3 to decide appeal of the Petitioner who, after giving 
personal hearing to the Petitioner, dismissed her appeal vide 
order dated 28.03.2022. The inquiry committee submitted 
report holding that the Petitioner is responsible for the loss to 
Government Exchequer. This report was probed into by the 
DG (Ops-II) and he submitted his report on 03.12.2019, 
thereupon; vide order dated 24.02.2020, a regular inquiry was 
conducted against the said accused officers and they were 
imposed the penalties, as mentioned above. 
7. 
Heard. Record perused. 
8. 
As this Petition has been filed by the Petitioner though in 
the scenario there are three others said to be her accomplices at 
this juncture, yet this Court would like to confine itself to the 
Writ Petitioner. Main grievance of the Petitioner is that she had 
not been provided with the necessary relevant record enabling 
her to rebut the false allegations and the role attributed to her 

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022 
                        -7- 
 
regarding 
alleged 
embezzlement; 
that 
no 
charge 
of 
embezzlement was proved against her except the irregularity; 
that once an inquiry conducted had been completed, then 
second inquiry initiated against her on the same charges was 
not warranted by law; that the Appellate Authority had not 
been vested with powers to enhance the penalty after it’s 
having been imposed once and the second inquiry could not 
have been conducted. 
9. 
Perusal of the record reveals that, following the events of 
constitution of Fact-Finding Committee by the order dated 
04.04.2019 of the Principal, Government Vocational Training 
Institute (W), Chakwal as well as constitution of Probe 
Committee by the orders of District Manager, TEVTA, 
Jhelum/Chakwal to probe the matter, District Manager 
TEVTA, Jhelum and Chakwal with his order dated 
20.08.2019 constituted an Inquiry Committee to probe into the 
matter. Petitioner submitted her written defence on 
18.09.2019. The Inquiry Committee visited the GVTI (W) 
Chakwal and, after having minutely examining Accounts 
record, bank statements and vouchers pertaining to the year 
2017 to 2019, issued a notice dated 14.10.2019 to the 
Petitioner for her appearance before the Inquiry Committee. 
During her hearing proceedings, on 22.10.2019 to 26.10.2019, 
she got her oral and written statement recorded and signed, 
but stated that the same had been obtained from her under 
coercion/pressure of the Respondents. However, question qua 
affixing fake signatures of the DDO on vouchers, she 
admitted that some of the vouchers though had her signatures 
but she denied having prepared them. The stance of the 
Petitioner that she had not been shown and provided with the 
record entirely stands negated in outcome of her above 
participation in inquiry proceedings.  
10. One of the stances of the Petitioner is that none of 
charges leveled against her has been proved except the 

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022 
                        -8- 
 
irregularity and thus major penalty could not be imposed on 
her in view of Section 10(6) of the Act especially in view of 
the observations made by the Inquiry Committee on 
15.11.2019, that as three others mentioned above i.e. Co-
signatory and signing authorities of vouchers and cheques 
were involved in this alleged commission of crime, therefore, 
a regular inquiry should have been conducted. It is also 
notable that while appearing before the Inquiry Committee 
she stated that such confession was made by her under 
pressure and coercion. But the fact remains that, despite a 
number of times she was summoned by the respondents for 
submission of her defence and stance, on one or the other 
pretext she did not join the proceedings, so her dismissal order 
was passed.  
11. The conclusion of aforementioned inquiry report dated 
15.11.2019 submitted by the Inquiry Committee before the 
competent authority reads as follows: 
“(1). On the basis of available record and 
documentary evidence, Mrs. Samra Gul, Accounts 
Clerk, Govt. Vocational Training Institute (W), 
Chakwal is responsible for the loss of Govt. 
Exchequer, which took place due to her negligence, 
carelessness, deviation of duly prescribed, non 
compliance of prescribed rules, regulations, system 
and procedure. But her share to the loss can only be 
bifurcated after holding an independent inquiry 
against other concerned officials i.e. DDO, Co-
signatory & Assistant Manager (Finance) District 
Manager Office, Jhelum& Chakwal because in our 
opinion, they are equally responsible as their 
negligence, carelessness and deviation from their 
basic/principal responsibilities which caused heavy 
financial loss to Govt. Exchequer. Being competent 
authority at the concerned/relevant position even 
they failed to take up/claim the loss from the 
concerned bank rather the kept mum over the issue 
with lethargic/irresponsible attitude. Moreover, no 
body inclusive Mst. Samra Gul, Accounts Clerk 
(GVTI(W), Chakwal did not play the role of whistle 
blower. 
(2).  
Bank Higher Authorities of BOP be 
approached with regards to fake signatures through 
TEVTA Higher Authorities.” 

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022 
                        -9- 
 
12. 
Script of the above reproduced conclusion may easily be 
split in the following heads: 
(i).  
Petitioner 
was 
allegedly 
found 
responsible 
for 
loss 
of 
Government 
Exchequer occurring due to her negligence, 
carelessness, non-compliance of rules and 
regulations,  
(ii). 
Imposition of major penalty against 
sole Petitioner under Section 10 (6) of the 
Act 
was 
not 
recommended, 
rather 
Petitioner’s share to the loss was found 
bifurcate-able only after holding of an 
independent inquiry against other concerned 
officials i.e. DDO, Co-Signatory & Assistant 
Manager (Finance), as they were alleged to 
be 
equally 
responsible 
for 
financial 
loss/embezzlement.  
 
13.  
Afterwards, General Manager (Operations-II)/Competent 
Authority passed order dated 24.02.2020 directing initiation of 
disciplinary proceedings/joint inquiry against petitioner and 
three other officials/officers, which inquiry was conducted and 
report thereof was submitted, on the basis whereof, impugned 
order dated 04.03.2021 was passed by Competent Authority. 
Significantly enough, said order dated 04.03.2021 transpires 
that: 
(i). 
 One of the other accused official Ms. 
Shazia Fazil had admitted the amounts had 
been transferred from Institute Account to 
her family members as well as she admitted 
that she did remain negligent and did not 
follow proper procedure in administrative 
matters 
and 
Inquiry 
Committee 
recommended 
imposing 
penalties 
of 
recovery of amount Rs.415, 275/- from her 
and forfeiture of her past 05 years service. 
But Competent Authority, vide order dated 
04.03.2021, ordered for above said recovery 
and her removal from service. It would be 
quite 
relevant 
to 
mention 
here 
that 
eventually she was reinstated in service as 
per order dated 07.04.2022 of appellate 
authority. 
(ii). 
Two other accused officials Mr. 
Muhammad Rizwan and Mst. Sumaira 

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022 
                        -10- 
 
Shiraz rebutted the charges of financial 
misappropriation and stated that they had 
no knowledge about the corruption in the 
institute. Again, it is quite important to 
mention here that above mentioned Mst. 
Sumaira 
Shiraz 
was 
appointed 
as 
departmental representative in order dated 
20.08.2019 aimed at initiation of earlier 
inquiry against the Petitioner 
(iii). The Petitioner did not appear for 
personal hearing, as such, had been 
proceeded against under Section 10 (2) of 
PEEDA Act, 2006 and, though having been 
recommended to be  removed from service, 
Competent Authority directed her dismissal 
from service. 
14. 
In 
petitioner’s 
appeal, 
the 
Appellate 
Authority 
maintained penalties imposed by Competent Authority and 
went even a leap ahead to direct the District Director, TEVTA 
Jhelum & Chakwal to initiate criminal proceedings against the 
Petitioner at the Regional Anti-Corruption Establishment, 
Jhelum & Chakwal for recovery of amount Rs.3, 669, 000/- 
from her.  
15. 
From all what has been enumerated above, it reveals that 
matter in hand involved certain factual questions including 
nature & extent of allocated/entrusted official duties of officials 
exposed in controversy, rules & regulations governing 
discharge of their duties, practice & procedure said officials 
were obliged to follow in discharge of their official obligations. 
In addition thereto, roles of accused officials involved in 
questioned transactions were required to be made distinctly 
identifiable & separable for fixing up their liabilities ahead. As 
has been mentioned above that the Petitioner and the other 
accused official Ms. Shazia Fazil have been attributed some of 
the admissions, but when it came question of recommendation 
of penalties in inquiry report and impugned order dated 
04.03.2021 based there upon as well as orders of Appellate 
Authority referred above, there is seen glaring and broad 
daylight like disparity in case of the Petitioner & said Ms. 

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022 
                        -11- 
 
Shazia Fazil.  Even notwithstanding case of Ms. Shazia Fazil, 
execution of certain agreement, affidavit, receipts of amounts 
allegedly deposited back by the Petitioner on account of 
misappropriated/embezzled amount is attributed to her, again 
requiring a regular inquiry for the purpose of said record being 
confronted to the Petitioner to determine veracity & 
genuineness of said record, particularly in response to the 
Petitioner’s allegations of coercion & harassment etc. The other 
two accused officials have been given way out in quite a queer 
manner without bringing on record sound basis & justifications 
in said regard.  
16. 
Summing up the matter, this Court is of the view that 
despite the fact that some of the charges levelled against the 
Petitioner were partially proved and despite recommendations 
of the Inquiry Committee a regular inquiry was not conducted 
against all the alleged accused officials/officers. Prima facie, it 
does not seem possible that the Petitioner alone managed such a 
fraud by making forgery, hiding record and making false and 
bogus entries in the computerized ledgers and this all escaped 
from the high ups especially the DDO. As on going through 
Drawing and Disbursing Officers (Rules 140 to 144) 6.46 of the 
same reads as under:- 
“6.46--No payment can be made on a 
bill or order signed by clerk instead of 
the Head of office or where the 
signature of the drawing officer are 
with rubber stamps. In all cases 
where signature on a bill is given by a 
mark or seal or thumb impression it 
should be attested by some known 
person…..”   
17. 
No regular inquiry was conducted for bringing on record 
relevant reliable evidence for fixing up extent of liability of 
culprit officials in subject issue as well as for onward 
determination of quantum of penalties. Necessity of conducting 
a regular inquiry in certain cases is stressed in case titled 
Muhammad Waris Vs. Director General, Punjab Emergency 

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022 
                        -12- 
 
Services Rescue 1122 , Lahore and 3 others [2022 P L C 
(C.S.) 367] reading that: 
“7. ... The spirit of law i.e. PEEDA Act is 
that such major punitive action against an 
employee should be taken after an inquiry 
within 
contemplation 
of 
law. 
The 
competent authority may, in exercise of the 
powers under PEEDA Act, 2006, by 
dispensing with the requirement of regular 
inquiry, follow the summary procedure, 
but this power must be exercised in 
exceptional cases, in which either there is 
no factual controversy or the facts are 
admitted. The competent authority may, 
without holding a regular inquiry, pass the 
final order, if the charge is not based on 
disputed questions of facts, otherwise 
dispensation of regular inquiry would 
amount to depriving of a person from right 
of defence and fair opportunity of hearing. 
8.  
Needless to say that it is against the 
principle of natural justice to draw a 
conclusion adverse to the interest of a 
person on the basis of disputed facts 
without 
recording 
the 
evidence 
and 
providing him proper opportunity of cross-
examining the witnesses and to make his 
defence. …”  
18. 
Further, It is held in case titled Dr. Rana Zeeshan Vs. 
Government of Punjab and others [2022 PLC (C.S) 1300] reading 
that: 
“8.  It is settled law that when an 
employee is to be terminated on the ground 
of misconduct, which in itself is a stigma, it 
is mandatory for the department to hold 
regular inquiry enabling the employees to 
defend the allegations levelled against him 
before an unbiased and independent 
forum.” 
19. 
Necessity of regular inquiry particular prevailing 
circumstances 
aiming 
at 
affording 
employee 
with 
opportunity of fair trial has exhaustively been elaborated in 
It is held in case titled “Muhammad Riaz Vs. Medical 
Superintendent, Service Hospital, Lahore and 2 others” [2016 
PLC (C.S) 296] reading as follows: 

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022 
                        -13- 
 
“8.  authority has been vested with a right to 
dispense with regular inquiry against an 
employee, but one must not lose sight of the 
fact that whenever any discretion is given to 
an authority, it has to be exercised not 
arbitrarily but honestly, justly, and fairly 
right in consonance with the spirit of law, 
after application of judicious mind and for 
substantial reasons. For this purpose, the 
nature of allegations against the accused 
has to be considered. In a case when it is 
clear to the authority that the allegations 
could be decided with reference to admitted 
record or he forms an opinion that un-
rebuttable evidence on the touchstone of 
QANUN-E-SHAHADAT, 
to 
prove 
the 
charge against the accused/employee is 
available on the record, the procedure for 
regular inquiry (Section 5 of the PEEDA 
Act), may be dispensed with, otherwise, the 
ends justice demand an inquiry through an 
Inquiry Officer or Inquiry Committee. … 
Thus, as a matter of fact this discretion has 
been made in the nature of judicial decision, 
which has to be exercised with due care and 
caution keeping in mind the principles of 
natural justice, fair trial and transparency, 
so that no prejudice should be caused to the 
accused/employee. There can be a situation 
where real fate 9f allegations can only be 
adjudged by a regular inquiry and not by 
mere textual proof. The legislatures further 
emphasized that if the authority after 
considering the nature of charge or charges 
and the material before him, concludes that 
regular inquiry is to be dispensed with, then 
the authority shall record reasons in that 
respect. The sole object behind careful 
drafting of said provision is indicative of the 
fact that legislature intended that the 
discretion which was being left up to the 
authority, must be exercised judiciously and 
not arbitrarily. … 
 
 
10.  
It is by now well settled that right to a 
fair trial means right to a proper hearing by 
an unbiased competent forum. Right to a fair 
trial 
has 
been 
associated 
with 
the 
fundamental right of access to justice, which 
should be read in every statute even if not 
expressly provided for unless specifically 
excluded. While incorporating Article 10A 
in the Constitution and making the right, to 

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022

a fair trial a fundamental right, the 
legislature did not define or describe the 
requisites of a fair trial, which showed that 
perhaps the intention was to give it the same 
meaning 
as 
is 
broadly 
universally 
recognized and embedded in jurisprudence 
in Pakistan. …” 
 
 
20. 
Record 
reveals 
that 
Inquiry 
Committee 
had 
recommended petitioner’s removal from service, whereas 
Competent 
Authority 
substituted 
said 
penalty 
with 
petitioner’s dismissal from service, that too, without 
assigning justifiable reasons and a speaking order. In said 
regard, this court has held in case titled Allah Ditta Vs. 
Province of Punjab and 2 others [2017 PLC (C.S) 437] reading 
as follows: 
“18.  Moreover, the impugned order dated 
22.12.2014 does not reflect that the 
Competent 
Authority 
has 
shown 
his 
disagreement 
specifically 
with 
the 
recommendations of the Inquiry Officer. 
Even otherwise if it is presumed that the 
dismissal order has been passed while 
disagreeing with the recommendations of 
the Inquiry Officer, the Competent Authority 
must have recorded specific reasons of his 
disbelieving the recommendations of the 
Inquiry Officer by elaborating the defences 
noted in paragraph 5 of the impugned order. 
Furthermore, the Competent Authority has 
recorded all the submissions of the 
Petitioner in paragraph 5 but while passing 
the dismissal order has not given specific 
findings for enhancing the penalty from 
forfeiture of past service for two years to 
dismissal from service and has also ignored 
the facts of defectiveness of the inquiry”. 
 
21.  
It is also worth mentioning that it is inalienable right of 
every citizen to be treated in accordance with law as envisaged 
by Article 4 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 
1973. Hence, it is the duty and obligation of every public 
functionary to act within the four corners of the mandate of the 
Constitution and the 2006 Act, and pass a speaking order.  

Writ Petition No.1407 of 2022

22. 
In view of the above, allowing this writ petition, the 
impugned order dated 04.03.2021 is set aside. This case is 
remitted back to the Director General TEVTA, Lahore with a 
direction to conduct a regular inquiry in the matter against all 
the alleged accused officials/officers including the Petitioner 
revealing 
duty/role/responsibility/wrong 
doing 
of 
each 
individual emerging from the inquiry calling for imposition of 
minor/major 
penalty 
against 
each 
one 
and 
submit 
outcome/report thereof within one month from the date of 
receipt of certified copy of this order. The Petitioner shall join 
the proceedings as and when so summoned by the Inquiry 
Officer.
