Brief facts, as per statement/فرد بیان (Ex.PA) got recorded by 
Waseem Nazir (complainant of the case/PW-2) to Muhammad Ramzan S.I. 
(PW-13) at the place of occurrence on 07.07.2009 at about 04:00 p.m., are 
that complainant is a labourer; marriage of Mst. Nabila Nazir (sister of 
complainant) was solemnized about five years prior to the occurrence with 
Muhammad Anwar and out of said wedlock, a baby boy was born who was 
alive; about two years prior to the occurrence, his sister got divorced from 
Muhammad Anwar due to domestic affairs (رھگولی ن اچیک); about one year prior to 
the occurrence, Mst. Nabila Nazir (sister of complainant) contracted 
marriage with Muhammad Afzal; after resentment with Muhammad Afzal, 
sister of complainant was living with the complainant for about four months 
and she had also instituted suit for recovery of maintenance allowance 
against Muhammad Afzal which was decreed; on 07.07.2009 at 03:00 p.m., 
complainant along with Mst. Nabila Nazir (his sister), Muhammad Jameel 
and Masood Ahmed Saleemi was sitting at the upper portion of his house; 
sister of the complainant was taking meal while sitting on  the cot; in the 
meantime, Muhammad Afzal armed with pistol .30 bore, Sajid armed with 
pistol, Khalid (empty handed) came at upper storey through stairs; 
Muhammad Afzal while raising lalkara asked Mst. Nabila Nazir that how 
she got decreed suit for recovery of maintenance allowance, today he had 
come there to give maintenance allowance and he fired consecutive shots 
with pistol upon his sister, which hit her on the bicep (ڈوال) of left arm, front 
side of abdomen, left rib and right bicep (ڈوال) whereas Sajid and Khalid while 
raising lalkara asked that no one should come near; sister of the complainant 
fell and all accused persons while raising lalkara that they had paid 
maintenance allowance, fled away; complainant along with his companions 
managed his sister, who in their view, succumbed to the injuries at the spot.  
 
 
Motive behind the occurrence was institution of suit for 
recovery of maintenance allowance by Mst. Nabila Nazir against 
Muhammad Afzal, which was decreed in her favour and due to said grudge, 
Muhammad Afzal in connivance of and consultation with his co-accused 
persons committed her murder.

On the basis of aforementioned statement/فرد بیان (Ex.PA), case 
vide F.I.R. No.613/2009 (Ex.PA/1), dated: 07.07.2009 under Sections: 302, 
34 PPC was registered at Police Station: Satellite Town, District: Sargodha.  
 
 
During post-mortem examination, Dr. Misbah Abu-Bakar  
(PW-4) found following injuries on the dead body of the deceased: - 
“i.  
A wound of entry in right renal angle inverted 
blackened margins 1 cm x 1 cm.  
 
ii.  
A wound of exit right hypochondriam everted 
margins 1 cm. 
 
iii.  
A wound of entry on right breast outer quadrant              
1 cm x 1 cm blackened inverted margin. 
 
iv.  
A wound of exit 1 cm x 1.5 cm everted margin in 
left armpit.  
 
v.  
A wound of entry in right arm 1 cm x 1 cm with 
inverted blackened margin swollen right arm. 
 
vi.  
A wound of exit on medial side of right arm 1.5 
cm x 1 cm everted margin. 
 
vii.  A wound of entry on left arm upper part 1 cm x              
1 cm blackened margin inverted. 
 
viii. A wound of exit left arm 1.5 cm x  1 cm medial 
side of left arm everted margin.”  
 
In the opinion of doctor (PW-4), cause of death in this case was due to 
damage of vital organs (liver and lungs) leading to internal haemorrhage, 
shock and death; all injuries were ante-mortem in nature; probable time 
between injuries and death was immediate whereas between death and post-
mortem was five to six hours.  
 
 
 
  
After completion of investigation, challan report under Section: 
173 Cr.P.C. was submitted in the Court; appellant and his co-accused (since 
acquitted) were formally charge sheeted, however, they pleaded not guilty and 
claimed trial whereupon prosecution evidence was summoned; after recording 
of prosecution evidence, accused persons were examined under Section: 342 
Cr.P.C. but they refuted the allegations levelled against them; they did not opt 
to appear as their own witnesses under Section: 340(2) Cr.P.C.; Sajid Ali and 
Khalid did not produce any evidence in their defence, however, Muhammad 
Afzal (appellant) produced some documents in his defence; in reply to 

Crl. Appeal No.64331-J/2019 & 
Crl. Revision No.43121/2019.

Question No.21, “Why this case is against you and why the PWs have 
deposed against you?, he stated as under: - 
“I am innocent. It was a blind murder. No one witnessed the 
occurrence as father of deceased was un-happy with this 
marriage. Wasim complainant was entrusted to grab the 
property of Nabila Nazir deceased so, he falsely involved me in 
this case because above said property was even given by me to 
deceased at the time Nikah as dower. For this purpose after 
the murder of Nabila Nazir complainant illegally sold out the 
above said property to one Shahzad Khan. PWs are related to 
the complainant so they falsely deposed against me and they 
are interested upon my conviction.”  
 
  
Trial court after conclusion of trial while acquitting co-accused 
namely Sajid Ali and Khalid, has convicted and sentenced the appellant as 
mentioned above through the impugned judgment dated: 21.05.2019. 
 
5. 
 
Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that conviction 
recorded and sentence awarded to the appellant through impugned judgment is 
against the ‘law and facts’ of the case; ocular account is neither trustworthy nor 
corroborated/supported by any other independent evidence. Learned counsel 
for the appellant finally prayed for acquittal of the appellant. 
 
6. 
   
Learned Deputy Prosecutor General has supported the impugned 
judgment to the extent of conviction and sentence recorded against Muhammad 
Afzal (appellant) and prayed for dismissal of his appeal.  
7.  
 
Learned counsel for the complainant while supporting impugned 
judgment to the extent of conviction recorded against the appellant prays for 
enhancement of the sentence. On Court’s query, learned counsel apprised that 
Crl. Appeal No.43120/2019 filed against acquittal of Sajid Ali and Khalid was 
not pressed after full length arguments and same was disposed of as such vide 
order dated: 18.04.2022 passed by this Court.  
 
8. 
   
Arguments heard.  Record perused. 
9.  
 
As per case of prosecution, occurrence took place at 03:00 p.m.  
on 07.07.2009 in the house of Waseem Nazir (complainant/PW-2), which is at 
a distance of ½ k.m. from the police station; police reached at the place of 
occurrence and complainant (PW-2) got recorded his statement (Ex.PA) 
regarding the occurrence at 04:00 p.m. to Muhammad Ramzan S.I. (PW-13) 
there, which was sent to the police station and First Information Report 
(F.I.R./Ex.PA/1) was recorded by Muhammad Nawaz S.I. (PW-8), however, 
Muhammad Ramzan S.I. (PW-13) while recording his statement in the Court 

Crl. Appeal No.64331-J/2019 & 
Crl. Revision No.43121/2019.  
 
5 
clearly stated that he recorded statement of the complainant (Ex.PA) when he 
was on patrol duty and thereafter reached at the place of occurrence; in this 
regard, relevant portions of his statement are reproduced: - 
“On 07.07.2009 I was posted as S.I at P.S Satellite Town, Sargodha. 
On the same day, I alongwith other police officials were present at          
Y-Block New Satellite Town for patrol duty where Wasim Nazir 
complainant appeared before me who got recorded his statement/Fard 
Biyan Exh.PA which I read over to him and he in token of its 
correctness made his signature. I sent complaint through Muhammad 
Arshad 288/C for registration crime report and I alongwith other 
police party went to place of occurrence.” 
 
“Before my first visit to the place of occurrence the crime report was 
already been registered on the statement of complainant. I recorded the 
statement of complainant at Y-Block.” 
 
so, place of recording statement of complainant for registration of case is 
“under a cloud”. In the statement/فرد بیان (Ex.PA) and F.I.R. (Ex.PA/1), it 
was mentioned that Nabila Nazir (deceased of the case) received firearm 
shots when she was taking meal/food while sitting on the cot in upper 
portion of the house and it was not mentioned with exactness that either she 
was available in the room, veranda or courtyard of said portion of the house; 
similarly, it was mentioned in statement/فرد بیان (Ex.PA) that after receiving 
firearm shots, she “fell” but not mentioned that she “fell on ground” and 
even in Column No.24 of the Inquest Report (Ex.PE), it is clearly shown that 
dead body was found on cot, which is hereby scanned below: - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
but neither said cot nor any blood of the deceased from said cot was taken 
into possession during investigation of the case rather blood was statedly 
secured from the floor. It was case of prosecution that she was taking 
meal/food but neither any residue of food nor any utensil was secured during 
investigation of the case and even same was not mentioned as available 
there, near or around the dead body of the deceased at the place of 

Crl. Appeal No.64331-J/2019 & 
Crl. Revision No.43121/2019.

occurrence in Columns No.22 and 23 of the Inquest Report (Ex.PE). Though 
it was also alleged that deceased lady received various firearm shots and as 
per Post-mortem Examination Report (Ex.PC), there were entry and exit 
wounds yet any empty shell or foreign metallic body fired from any bullet 
was not found from the spot; any marks of hitting or striking of any such 
foreign metallic body at abovementioned cot, floor, wall or roof of the 
house, were not found and in this regard, site plans of the place of 
occurrence i.e. Ex.PG, Ex.PB and Columns No.22 & 23 of the Inquest 
Report (Ex.PE) can be advantageously referred; therefore, exact place of 
occurrence, is also “under a cloud” in the case.  
 
It is important to mention here that alleged last worn clothes of the 
deceased were neither blood stained nor having holes of firearm shots and in 
this regard, relevant portion of statement of Dr. Misbah Abu-Bakar (PW-4) 
is hereby reproduced: - 
“It is correct that I recorded the correct condition of the last worn 
clothes of the deceased. It is correct that I have not mentioned the 
staining of blood or holes on the clothes of the deceased in Ex.P.C. 
Had I found the holes on the last worn clothes of deceased and 
staining of blood on the clothes. I would have recorded so.”  
 
Even in Column No.7 of the Inquest Report (Ex.PE), clothes of the deceased 
have not been mentioned as blood stained or having holes/marks and same is 
hereby scanned below: - 
 
 
 
 
 
Said state of affairs raises question mark regarding “condition of the 
deceased and circumstances” at the time of receipt of injuries by her. “Date 
& Time” of receiving dead body in the hospital and “Date & Hour” of death 
and examination of body are not mentioned in the Post-mortem Examination 
Report (Ex.PC) and in this regard, relevant portions of statement of Women 
Medical Officer (PW-4) are also reproduced: - 
“I do not remember the time when the dead body was received in the 
hospital. I do not remember the time when the post-mortem 

Crl. Appeal No.64331-J/2019 & 
Crl. Revision No.43121/2019.  
 
7 
examination was conducted. It is correct that the column of death 
and the column of examination of body are left blank on post-
mortem report Ex.PC. ”  
“I do not remember when I received the papers for conducting post-
mortem examination.”  
However, perusal of Injury Statement (Ex.PD) of the deceased reflects that it 
was referred to Women Medical Officer at 07:10 p.m. on 07.07.2009. Lady 
Dr. Misbah Abu-Bakar (PW-4) observed in Post-mortem Examination 
Report (Ex.PC) that probable time between injuries and death was 
immediate and the time between the death and post-mortem was 5 to 6 
hours; relevant portion of statement of PW-4 in this regard is as under: - 
“The probable time between injuries and death was immediate and 
the time between the death and post-mortem was five to six hours.”  
but “Rigor Mortis” on the dead body of the deceased was fully developed; 
relevant portion of statement of PW-4 in this regard is reproduced: - 
“Rigor mortis on the dead body of deceased were fully developed 
when I conducted post-mortem examination.”  
As far as “opinion of expert” is concerned, it must be based upon the settled 
principles on the subject and relevant treatises but if it is otherwise then 
same has to be examined carefully on touchstone of relevant principles on 
the subject and treatises and if it has been found contrary to those, then it 
shall be treated and considered as ipse dixit and Court shall make its opinion 
while preferring settled principles on the subject found in relevant treatises; 
in this case, on the one hand Dr. Misbah Abu-Bakar (PW-4), who conducted 
post-mortem examination of deceased lady, opined that probable time 
between death and post-mortem is five to six hours but on the other hand, 
she has categorically found that rigor mortis on the dead body was “fully 
developed”.  Since said opinion regarding duration of time between death 
and post-mortem is not tallying with the time usually consumed for reaching 
rigor mortis to “developed stage”, therefore, it has been examined on the 
touchstone of the established principles on the subject; as a matter of fact, 
rigor mortis means rigidity of death, it is a condition characterised by 
stiffening, shortening and opacity of the muscles which follow the period of 
primary relaxation.  It is due to chemical changes involving the proteins of 

Crl. Appeal No.64331-J/2019 & 
Crl. Revision No.43121/2019.  
 
8 
the muscle  fibres  and it marks the end of the muscle’s cellular or molecular 
life.  The contractile element of the muscle consists of protein filaments of 
two types, viz, myosin and actin.  They lie in interdigitating manner.  In the 
relaxed state, the actin filaments interdigitate with the myosin filaments only 
to a small extent but when the muscle contracts, they interdigitate to a great 
extent.  The principal factor concerned in the process of contraction and 
relaxation of the muscle is the presence of the enzyme ATP which is in high 
concentration in a resting muscle.  Its production and utilisation are 
constantly balanced in life.  After death, ATP is resynthesised for a short 
time depending upon the glycogen available locally, but after this glycogen 
is used up, ATP cannot be resynthesised.  This leads to the fusion of myosin 
and actin filaments into a dehydrated stiff gel resulting in the condition 
known as rigor mortis.  During rigor mortis, the reaction of the muscle 
changes from slightly alkaline to distinctly acid owing probably to the 
formation of lactic acid.  Rigor mortis persists until autolysis of myosin and 
actin filaments occurs as a part of putrefaction.  Every muscle in the body, 
voluntary and involuntary, takes part in the process, including the 
musculature of the heart and blood vessels, the iris of the eye, the platysma 
of the skin, and the dartos of the scrotum.  According to Parikh”s Textbook 
of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology, rigor mortis first appears in 
involuntary muscles and then in voluntary muscles.  It is not dependent on 
the nerve supply as it develops in paralysed limbs also.  It is tested by gently 
bending the various joints of the body.  In the involuntary muscles, rigor 
mortis appears in the heart within a hour after death.  In the voluntary 
muscles, the sequence is as follows: Rigor mortis first appears as a rule in 
the muscles of the eyelids (3-4 hours), and then in the muscles of the face (4-
5 hours), neck and trunk (5-7 hours), followed by muscles of the upper 
extremities (7-9 hours) and then the legs (9-11 hours).  The last to be 
affected are the small muscles of the fingers and toes (11-12 hours). When 
rigor mortis is thus established, the jaw, neck, and extremities become fixed 
in position with the arms bent at the elbows and the legs at the knees and 
hips, and movements at the joint are possible only within a very limited 
range. The rigidity generally passes off, in the same order in which it 
occurred, due to autolysis of muscle proteins.  In Sub-continent (Indo-Pak), 

Crl. Appeal No.64331-J/2019 & 
Crl. Revision No.43121/2019.

rigor mortis commences in 2-3 hours after death, takes about 12 hours to 
develop from head to foot, persists for another 12 hour, and takes about 12 
hours to pass off.  Thus, the presence and extent, or absence of rigor mortis 
helps to provide a rough estimate of the time since death.  As for example, if 
rigor mortis has not set in, the time since death would be within 2 hours and 
if it has developed, the time since death would be within about 12-24 hours.  
The factors which influence rigor mortis include age, health and mode of the 
death also and according to Parikh”s Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and 
Toxicology, the onset of rigor is later and the duration longer in the strong 
muscular person and similarly in cases of sudden death, in healthy adults, a 
late onset and a long duration is usual.  In Modi’s Medical Jurisprudence & 
Toxicology, it has been categorically mentioned that in general, rigor mortis 
sets in one to two hours after death, is developed in about twelve hours. 
  
Perusal of columns No.16 and 17 of the Inquest Report (Ex.PE) of 
Nabeela Nazeer reflects that it was dead body of powerful (طاقتور) and strong 
(بوط ضم) person; post-mortem report of the deceased and statement of doctor 
(PW-4) clearly shows that death of the deceased was immediate after receipt 
of injuries hence it was sudden death, therefore, according to established 
principles of Medical Jurisprudence, onset of rigor mortis was later and its 
duration was longer. Thus, the opinion given by the doctor (PW-4) regarding 
time between death and post-mortem as five to six hours is mere ipse dixit 
and not according to settled principles of Medical Jurisprudence on the 
subject, therefore, when doctor has himself observed that rigor mortis was 
“fully developed”; as per inquest report, dead body was of powerful and 
strong person, assailants came and shots were fired at deceased and death 
was “just after receipt of the injuries i.e. sudden”, then, by no stretch of 
imagination, time between death and post-mortem of the deceased person 
can be considered as less than twelve hours. Therefore, medical evidence has 
negated that occurrence took place at the stated/alleged time and when exact 
time of occurrence has not been proved by the prosecution, then entire 
superstructure of the case of prosecution has been smashed and fallen like 
house of cards. 

Crl. Appeal No.64331-J/2019 & 
Crl. Revision No.43121/2019.  
 
10
  
It is also relevant to mention that cutting/overwriting was found in the 
Inquest Report (Ex.PE) by the doctor (PW-4) and relevant portion of his 
statement in this regard is as under: - 
“It is correct that in inquest report Ex.PE the date has been changed 
from 06.07.2009 to 07.07.2009 by making overwriting on the digit of 
06. It is correct that in column No.3 of inquest report Ex.PE the time 
has been changed from 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 by making overwriting on the 
digit of 02. It is correct that no initial signatures are present on the 
overwriting.” 
Though Waseem Nazir (complainant/PW-2) claimed himself as resident of 
house of occurrence as well as eyewitness yet close scrutiny of the record 
reveals that he in the statement/فرد بیان (Ex.PA) and also during statement 
before the Court stated that Muhammad Afzal fired consecutive shots with 
pistol upon his sister, which hit her on the bicep (ڈوال) of left arm, front side of 
abdomen, left rib and right bicep (ڈوال) but as per Post-mortem Examination 
Report (Ex.PC) during autopsy of the deceased, any entry wound on front of 
abdomen as well as any entry wound on left rib of the deceased was not 
found. It goes without saying that if eyewitnesses have themselves opted to 
narrate exact locale of the entry wounds in their statements and same is not 
confirmed by medical evidence, then none-else but prosecution has to suffer.  
 
Waseem Nazir (complainant/PW-2) stated during statement before the 
Court that deceased received only those injuries which he has described; 
relevant portion of his statement is as under: - 
“It is correct that except my described locale of injuries being 
received on the person of my deceased sister no other injury was 
received by her.”  
but Post-mortem Examination Report (Ex.PC) and statement of the doctor 
(PW-4) reflect that the deceased also received entry wounds at right renal 
angle area and at right breast outer quadrant; relevant portions of statement 
of the doctor (PW-4) are as under: - 
“i.  
A wound of entry in right renal angle inverted blackened 
margins 1 cm x 1 cm.”  
 
“iii.  A wound of entry on right breast outer quadrant               
1 cm x 1 cm blackened inverted margin.”

So, ocular version deposed by complainant has not been supported/ 
confirmed in stricto sensu by medical evidence.  
  
When cot was neither taken into possession during investigation nor 
produced before the Court then to justify securing of blood from the floor, 
Waseem Nazir (complainant/PW-2) introduced dishonest improvements in 
his statement and same is as under: - 
“I have recorded in my statement Exh.PA that after receiving the 
fire shots my deceased sister fell on ground confronted with Exh.PA 
where the word ground is not mentioned.”  
 
By now it is well settled that witness who introduces dishonest improvement 
for strengthening the case, cannot be relied; in this regard, case of 
“MUHAMMAD ARIF versus The STATE” (2019 SCMR 631) and  
“KHALID MEHMOOD and another versus The STATE and others” 
(2021 SCMR 810) can be advantageously referred. Complainant (PW-2) also 
expressed his ignorance about certain admitted facts qua execution of 
agreement (اقرار نامہ) between deceased of the case and Muhammad Afzal 
(appellant); relevant portion of his statement in this regard is as under: - 
“It is not in my knowledge that before marriage with my deceased 
sister there was an agreement between Muhammad Afzal accused 
and my deceased sister. At this stage the attested copy of Iqrar Nama 
Exh.DA was being confronted to the witness and he endorsed his 
signature upon said Iqrar Nama being made by him as witness.”  
It is trite law that witness who denies admitted facts cannot be termed as 
reliable witness and in this regard, case of “ARSHAD MASIH versus The 
STATE” (2006 MLD 1078), “MUHAMMAD RIAZ versus THE 
STATE” (2007 P Cr. L J 446) and “MUHAMMAD RAMZAN and 
another versus THE STATE” (2008 YLR 1859) can be advantageously 
referred.  
 
So far as Masood Ahmad Saleemi (PW-3) is concerned, he was 
admittedly not resident of the place of occurrence rather 5/6 k.m. away from 
the place of occurrence; in this regard, relevant portion of statement of 
complainant (PW-2) is as under: - 
“Masood Ahmad PW-3 is my Behnoi. Jamil PW is my Khaloo. 
House of Jamil is at a distance of about 2 K.M. away from the place 
of occurrence. House of PW-3 Masood Ahmad is at a distance of 
about 4/5 K.M. away from the place of occurrence. Masood Saleemi 
is resident of Istiqlalabad.”  
 

Crl. Appeal No.64331-J/2019 & 
Crl. Revision No.43121/2019.  
 
12
On the same point, relevant portion of statement of Masood Ahmad Saleemi 
(PW-3) is hereby reproduced: - 
“Waseem is my Khalazad and ‘Sala’. I was resident of Istiqlabad 
during the days of occurrence which is 4/5 IK.M. away from the 
place of occurrence. I was not having any business or office in New 
Satellite Town during the days of occurrence.”  
 
So, he is a chance witness and no explanation/plausible reason regarding his 
presence at the “time and place” of occurrence is mentioned in the 
statement/فرد بیان (Ex.PA) and F.I.R. (Ex.PA/1). Furthermore, Masood 
Ahmad Saleemi (PW-3) tried to introduce reason of his presence at the spot 
in following words: - 
“I was present at the place of occurrence for settling the family 
dispute between Nabila and Afzal accused. Jameel, Waseem and 
neighbour Furrakh Aslam were present there. ”  
 
 
 
 
 
 
             “emphasis added” 
 
 
whereas Farrukh Aslam (PW-9) did not state so and relevant portion of his 
statement is as under: - 
“My friend Abdul Qayyum informed me telephonically about the 
murder and I rushed to the hospital. It is correct that neither Waseem 
complainant nor uncle/Mamoon of the deceased informed me.”  
 
Furthermore, any said reason was neither mentioned by Waseem Nazir 
(complainant/PW-2) in the statement/فرد بیان (Ex.PA) nor deposed so in his 
statement before the Court and importantly not corroborated by Farrukh 
Aslam (PW-9), hence, said reason was an afterthought and not acceptable; 
therefore, testimony of PW-3, who was a chance witness, is “suspect” 
evidence and cannot be accepted without pinch of salt; guidance in this 
regard has been sought from the case of “Mst. Sughra Begum and another 
Vs. Qaiser Pervez and others.” (2015 SCMR 1142) and relevant portion 
from paragraph No.14 of said case law is hereby reproduced: - 
“14.  A chance witness, in legal parlance is the one who claims 
that he was present on the crime spot at the fateful time, albeit, his 
presence there was a sheer chance as in the ordinary course of 
business, place of residence and normal course of events, he was 
not supposed to be present on the spot but at a place where he 
resides, carries on business or runs day to day life affairs. It is in 
this context that the testimony of chance witness, ordinarily, is not 
accepted unless justifiable reasons are shown to establish his 
presence at the crime scene at the relevant time. In normal course, 
the presumption under the law would operate about his absence 
from the crime spot. True that in rare cases, the testimony of 
chance witness may be relied upon, provided some convincing

Crl. Revision No.43121/2019.  
 
13
explanations appealing to prudent mind for his presence on the 
crime spot are put forth, when the occurrence took place otherwise, 
his testimony would fall within the category of suspect evidence and 
cannot be accepted without a pinch of salt.” 
 
Guidance on the subject has been sought from the case of  “G. M. Niaz 
versus The State” (2018 SCMR 506), “Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu 
versus The State” (2019 SCMR 652), “Sufyan Nawaz and another 
versus The State and others” (2020 SCMR 192) and “Mst. Mir Zalai 
versus Ghazi Khan and others” (2020 SCMR 319). 
 
Furthermore, locale of receipt of firearm shots by deceased i.e. in 
front of abdomen and left rib narrated by Masood Ahmad Saleemi (PW-3), 
was not confirmed by medical evidence and entry wounds at right renal area 
and on breast of the deceased were not deposed by him, hence his version 
was also not supported/confirmed by medical evidence in stricto sensu. So, 
prosecution’s ocular account is neither trustworthy nor confidence inspiring, 
hence not reliable. 
 
So far as recovery of pistol (P5) from Muhammad Afzal (appellant) is 
concerned, as per report of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore 
(Ex.PR), said recovered pistol was not functional and in absence of recovery 
of any empty from the place of occurrence, said recovery is inconsequential 
and cannot provide any corroboration to the case of prosecution.   
 
As far as motive is concerned, it is notable that in case of murder of a 
person by his trusted/closely related person, if any cause of murder is 
alleged/claimed by the prosecution, same attains vital importance. In this 
case, complainant categorically claimed that due to institution of suit for 
recovery of maintenance allowance in Family Court by the deceased lady, 
which was decreed in her favour, Muhammad Afzal (appellant) bore grudge 
and committed murder; relevant portion of statement of complainant (PW-2) 
in this regard is as under: - 
“She had instituted a suit for recovery of maintenance allowance in 
Family Court which was decreed in her favour. The accused 
Muhammad Afzal had bore grudge due to that accused Muhammad 
Afzal alongwith accused Sajid and accused Khalid accused 
committed the murder of my sister.”  
 
however, during cross-examination it came out from mouth of the 
complainant that suit for recovery of maintenance allowance was decreed on 

Crl. Appeal No.64331-J/2019 & 
Crl. Revision No.43121/2019.

condition of rehabilitation of his sister (now deceased of the case) with 
Muhammad Afzal (appellant); relevant portions of statement of complainant 
(PW-2) are reproduced: - 
 
“It is correct that my deceased sister instituted a suit for 
maintenance allowance against Muhammad Afzal accused which 
was subsequently withdrawn from the court. It is not in my 
knowledge that again on dated 20.01.2009 my deceased sister 
instituted the suit for maintenance against Muhammad Afzal 
accused. The suit for maintenance being instituted by my deceased 
sister was decreed with condition to rehabilitate with Muhammad 
Afzal accused.”  
 
“It is not in my knowledge that for compliance of decree my 
deceased sister ever file any execution petition before the Court.” 
 
So, when suit for recovery of maintenance allowance was decreed on the 
condition of rehabilitation of deceased lady with the appellant and it was not 
mentioned in the statement/فرد بیان (Ex.PA) and F.I.R. (Ex.PA/1) that after 
decree of the suit, she went to the house of the appellant or was residing with 
him but he did not pay the maintenance allowance and she filed petition for 
execution of the decree, then there was no cause of annoyance/grudge with 
the appellant to commit murder of the deceased lady. Therefore, motive has 
rightly not been believed by the trial court through paragraph No.15 of the 
impugned judgment. Even otherwise, when substantive piece of evidence in 
the form of ocular account has been disbelieved, then motive is of no help to 
the case of prosecution as the same loses its efficacy.  
So far as abscondance of the appellant is concerned, suffice it to say 
that it has to be proved like any other fact, however, in this case, warrant of 
arrest (Ex.PH) reveals that it was not issued to any police officer or public 
servant for execution rather through this warrant Muhammad Afzal was asked 
to arrest Muhammad Afzal; similarly, it has not been mentioned in the 
proclamation  (Ex.PK) that in how much period or till which date, accused 
had to surrender; therefore, both warrant and proclamation are defective, 
mandatory requirements in the same have not been fulfilled and prosecution 
could not prove this limb of its case. It is important to mention here that 
abscondance is not proof of the charge; in this regard, guidance has been 
sought from the cases of “Wajeeh-ul-Hassan versus The State” (2019 SCMR 
1994) and “KHALID MEHMOOD alias KHALOO versus The STATE”             

Crl. Appeal No.64331-J/2019 & 
Crl. Revision No.43121/2019.  
 
15
(2022  S C M R 1148); furthermore, when ocular account has been disbelieved, 
then abscondance is of no help to the case of prosecution. Reliance is placed 
on the case of “Rohtas Khan versus The State” (2010 SCMR 566).  
10. 
Nutshell of the above discussion is that prosecution has been failed to 
prove its case against the appellant, therefore, there is no need to discuss 
defence version. 
11. 
In view of what has been discussed above, Criminal Appeal 
No.64331-J/2019, filed by Muhammad Afzal (appellant) is allowed; 
conviction recorded and sentence awarded to the appellant through 
impugned judgment dated: 21.05.2019 is hereby set-aside. Appellant is 
acquitted of the charge, he be released from jail forthwith, if not required in 
any other case. 
12.   Consequent 
upon 
aforementioned 
reasons, 
Criminal 
Revision 
No.43121/2019 filed by Waseem Nazir (complainant) for enhancement of 
sentence of Muhammad Afzal, has lost its relevance; therefore, same also               
stands dismissed.
