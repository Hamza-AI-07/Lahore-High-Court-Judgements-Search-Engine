Through this reference under section 196 of 
the Customs Act, 1969 (“Act”), inter alia, the 
following questions of law arising out of the 
impugned judgment dated 18.01.2024 passed by 
the Customs Appellate Tribunal, Bench-II, Lahore 
have been proposed for our opinion:-  
a. Whether the learned Tribunal was 
justified to decide the case ex-parte 
without sending a copy of appeal or 
hearing the Department in Customs 
Appeal No. 418-LB/2022 and in 
absence of any para wise comments by 
the department? 
b. Whether the impugned judgment 
which is passed without affording the 
opportunity of hearing to the appellant 
and without receiving the reply of the 
appeal is sustainable in the eye of law 
and is not in violation of right of fair 
Trial as guaranteed Under Article 10-A 
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, 1973? 
 
2. 
Through 
the 
impugned 
consolidated 
judgment, two separate Customs Appeals bearing 
No.417/LB/2022 and No.418/LB/2022, former of 
the two filed by Meharban s/o Abdul Jabbar (not a 
party in this reference) and latter by Israr Ahmad 
son of Inayat ullah (Respondent No. 3 herein), 
against two separate Orders-in-Original Nos. 170 
and 171 of 2022, both dated 13.04.2022, passed by 
Collector of Customs (Adjudication), Faisalabad 

Custom Reference No. 07 of 2024

Camp Office at MCC, Multan relating to allegedly 
smuggled Foreign Origin goods i.e. Cloth, 
Cigarettes, Betel Nuts, Welding Electrodes etc. 
have been decided, wherein both the appellants in 
their separate defense took stance that they had 
purchased the same against payment of price and 
duties through official auction of seized smuggled 
goods conducted by different camps/offices of 
Customs department. Learned counsel for the 
applicant/Director, Directorate of Intelligence & 
Investigation, Customs, Regional Office Multan 
(„Applicant‟) states that the learned counsel Ms. 
Aneela Jamil, Advocate („Counsel‟ / „Advocate‟), 
whose attendance was marked on behalf of the 
applicant (respondent in Customs Appeal No.  
No.418/LB/2022 before the Appellate Tribunal), 
was actually the counsel for the Collectorate of 
Customs (Enforcement), Customs Department, 
Multan, respondent in the connected Customs 
Appeal No.417/LB/2022, which falls under a 
separate branch in the Customs department and she 
was only representing the said respondent, whereas 
she had not been engaged as a counsel by the 
applicant for appearing on his behalf in the 
Customs Appeal No.418/LB/2022, yet without any 
legal justification and perhaps inadvertently her 
attendance was marked on behalf of respondents in 
both the aforesaid appeals, which were based on 
separate and distinct facts, resulting in passing of 
the impugned consolidated judgment and he claims 
the same to be against the facts of the case and law 
on the subject. Further states that neither any notice 
was issued to the applicant nor any reply was 
sought or opportunity of hearing was afforded 
before passing the impugned judgment against the 
applicant. 
Moreover 
the 
Customs 
Appellate 

Custom Reference No. 07 of 2024 
 
3 
 
Tribunal had no justifiable reason to mark 
attendance of Ms. Aneela Jamil, Advocate on 
behalf of Director, Directorate of Intelligence & 
Investigation-Customs, Multan, as she did not hold 
any brief and power of attorney on his behalf, 
hence it claimed that the applicant has not been 
provided a fair trial and has been condemned 
unheard, which has prejudiced his rights and inter 
alia, on the basis of afore-mentioned facts and 
grounds prays for setting aside the impugned 
judgments.  
3. 
Although learned counsel for the respondent 
No.3 has vehemently defended the impugned 
judgment by stating that facts of the case and law 
on the subject have been properly appreciated by 
the Tribunal while reaching final conclusion in the 
matter, which he has tried to justify on various 
factual and legal grounds, yet he has not been able 
to show from the record power of attorney in 
favour of the aforementioned advocate authorizing 
her to appear on behalf of applicant and represent 
him in the appeal No. 418/LB/2022 decided by the 
Tribunal and we are not convinced that the 
applicant was duly represented before the Customs 
Appellate Tribunal and his stance was taken into 
consideration for decision of the said appeal 
through consolidated judgment impugned herein. 
Hence, the question arises that whether there was 
compliance of due process and the applicant has 
been provided with a fair trial as mentioned in 
Article 10-A of the Constitution of Pakistan.  
4. 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case 
titled Jawad S. Khawaja and another v. 
Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2024 SC 
337) while considering scope and essential 
ingredients of right of fair trial in reference to 

Custom Reference No. 07 of 2024 
 
4 
 
Article 10-A of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 “the Constitution” has 
held that basic ingredients for a fair trial in the light 
of Article 10-A of the Constitution are that there 
should be an independent, impartial court, a fair 
and public hearing, right of counsel, right to 
information of the offence charged for with an 
opportunity to cross examine witnesses and an 
opportunity to produce evidence. It also includes 
the right to a reasoned judgment and finally the 
remedy of appeal. Hence, the ultimate objective is 
to ensure fairness in the process and proceedings 
and fairness itself being an evolving concept cannot 
be confined to any definition or frozen at any 
moment, with certain fundamentals which operate 
as constants. Independence of the decision maker 
and their impartiality is one such constant. A 
reasoned judgment before a judicial forum is 
another constant without which the right of fair trial 
would 
become 
meaningless. 
Right 
of 
an 
independent forum of appeal is another relevant 
constant which ensures fair trial.  
5. 
Moreover, it is also important to note that 
Article 10-A, of the Constitution had provided the 
right of a fair trial and due process to accused or 
person likely to be affected, which included his 
right to be represented by a counsel of his own 
choice or at least a counsel in order to protect his 
rights. Every person accused of howsoever heinous 
crime, has the right under the law to be represented 
by a counsel of his own choice and if, for some 
reason, it was not possible, Court if possible, might 
take care thereof in accordance with law.  Reliance 
in this regard in addition to aforementioned 
judgment of Supreme Court may also be placed on 
the judgments reported as Tahir Mehmood vs. The 

Custom Reference No. 07 of 2024 
 
5 
 
State (1997 PCrLJ 565), Muhammad Umair vs. 
The State and another (2024 PCrLJ 183) and 
Rajab Ali vs. The State (2019 MLD 1713).  
6. 
It is pertinent to mention here that due 
process also includes reasonable right of hearing 
for the purpose of explaining position of a party 
before proceeding against it and the same is 
recognized as a fundamental principle of Natural 
justice and very important right in justice system to 
ensure that injustice and unfairness is not done to 
any party. While explaining the same, the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in case titled Muhammad 
Yousaf vs. Province of Sindh and others (2024 
SCMR 1689) has observed that due process is a 
prerequisite that needs to be respected at all 
stratums. Right to fair trial is a fundamental right. 
In case of stringency and rigidity in affording this 
right, it is the function, rather a responsibility, of 
the court to protect this right so that no injustice 
and unfairness is done to anybody. The concept of 
natural justice is intended to restrain arbitrary 
actions within the bounds of upholding and 
protecting the supremacy of law. This fundamental 
principle is consistently and squarely applicable to 
the proceedings, whether judicial, quasi-judicial or 
administrative, except where the law specifically 
and unambiguously excludes its application in the 
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. The 
solitary pragmatic importance of the rule of natural 
justice is to prevent injustice and miscarriage of 
justice, and ensure that justice is not only done, but 
is also manifestly and undoubtedly seen to be done.  
7. 
Now coming to the impugned judgment. The 
subject matter is issue in both the above mentioned 
appeals decided through the impugned consolidated 
judgment belonging to separate persons (appellants 

Custom Reference No. 07 of 2024 
 
6 
 
before the Appellate Tribunal, mentioned above) 
was entirely different, alleged smuggled goods 
were claimed to have been purchased through 
auctions held by Customs Authorities at camps in 
its various offices and related to seizure of different 
kinds of allegedly smuggled foreign origin goods 
belonging to different person and even the seizing 
agencies were different and the matter in issue in 
both cases/appeals though may be claimed by the 
respondents to have various similarities yet had no 
direct nexus with each other in various aspects 
peculiar to transactions, specially relating to claim 
of lawful purchase through payment of price and 
duties in those cases, which required analysis on 
case to case basis. In the present case proper notice 
has not been effectively served upon the applicant 
denying him right to present his stance, which 
should  have been taken into consideration while 
passing the final judgment and it is also claimed 
that 
the 
detailed 
facts 
of 
the 
case 
and 
distinguishable features of both the cases were not 
properly appreciated while passing the impugned 
judgment and the learned counsel whose attendance 
was marked on behalf of the applicant (respondent 
in the appeal) was neither engaged as counsel nor 
was authorized to represent the applicant and also 
did not hold brief on his behalf to render proper 
assistance to the Tribunal relating to dispute and 
issues subject matter of the appeal filed against the 
applicant, which related to a different and entirely 
distinct transaction from the one for which the said 
learned counsel had been engaged by a separate 
Collectorate of Customs Department, to represent 
it. Had the applicant been provided opportunity of 
audience and to submit a reply, he could have 
presented his stance and valid reasons to defend the 

Custom Reference No. 07 of 2024 
 
7 
 
Order-in-Original under challenge in appeal and the 
Tribunal would have been in a better position to 
reach a just conclusion in the matter, which may 
have gone in favour of either party. Hence, it is 
concluded that through inadvertence, applicant has 
not been provided with a fair opportunity to be 
represented by a counsel of his own choice and 
present his case, hence has been condemned 
unheard, which besides being against the principles 
of natural justice is also against the principles of 
due process and fair trial enshrined by Article 10-A 
of the Constitution mentioned with approval in the 
afore-referred judgments, hence prejudice has been 
caused to the applicant.  
8. 
On the basis of the foregoing discussion, 
both the questions of law proposed for our opinion 
referred to above are decided in the negative. 
9. 
In view of what has been discussed above, 
the impugned judgment to the extent that the same 
deals with Customs Appeal No.418/LB/2022 is not 
sustainable and therefore, we allow this reference 
and set aside the impugned judgment and remand 
the said appeal to the Learned Appellate Tribunal 
for providing proper opportunity of hearing to the 
parties and then to conclude/decide the said 
Customs Appeal afresh on its own merits in 
accordance with law expeditiously preferably 
within a period of two months from the date of 
receipt of certified copy of this order. 
10. 
Office is directed to send a copy of this order 
to Customs Appellate Tribunal, Lahore.
