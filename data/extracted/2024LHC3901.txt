Respondent 
No. 3  
Ex-parte vide order dated 05.06.2024. 
 
  
 SULTAN TANVIR AHMAD, J:- The 
petitioner filed an application, under section 25 of the 
Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 (the „Act of 1890‟), for the 
custody of minor Rayyan Muhammad Yamin (the „minor’) 
born on 28.10.2015 in United States of America („USA’). 
Respondent No. 3 / father was proceeded against ex-parte 
due to his failure to pursue the case and thereafter, vide ex-
parte judgment dated 21.03.2024 the application was 
allowed and the petitioner was held entitled for the custody 
of the minor, however, learned Judge Family / Guardian, 
Model Town, Lahore (the „Guardian Court’) refused the 
general leave to take the minor abroad and rather a 
condition has been imposed on shifting the minor beyond 
territorial jurisdiction. Being aggrieved, the petitioner 

 
Writ Petition No. 27113 of 2024       (Judgment)

approached the learned Appellate Court through Guardian 
Appeal No. 38/24. Nevertheless, to the extent of above said 
refusal or condition the prayer of the petitioner was turned 
down, hence, this petition.  
2.  
 
Barrister Syeda Maqsooma Zahra Bokhari 
(learned counsel for the petitioner) has argued that learned 
two Courts below have not considered that the minor was 
not just born in USA but he also has his education institution 
in USA, therefore the minor cannot be restrained from 
returning to his place of birth and to resume his education; 
that the restriction in section 26 of the Act of 1890 comes 
into effect when there is a reason or some application from a 
non-custodial parent who wishes the minor to be close for 
meeting(s) or adherence of schedule framed by the learned 
Guardian Court, however, in the present case the 
respondent-father despite knowledge of the proceedings up-
till now has failed to take any interest in the Court 
proceedings or to observe the visitation schedule or for that 
matter to take any step for the welfare of the minor. Learned 
counsel for the petitioner has also argued that the law has 
already been settled by the learned Sindh High Court in 
cases titled “Dr. Aisha Yousuf Versus Khalid Muneer and 2 
Others” (PLD 2012 Sindh 166) and “Scherazade Jamali 
Versus Hisham Gillani and Others” (PLD 2018 Sindh 377) 
but somehow the learned Appellate Court, instead of 
following the principle settled or being persuaded from the 
observations made therein, has  refused adhering to the same 
for the reason that these judgments have not declared section 
26 of the Act of  1890 as ultra vires and this approach 
adopted by the learned Appellate Court is not tenable. Added 
that even otherwise, the learned Appellate Court should have 
granted general leave to the take the minor to USA for 

 
Writ Petition No. 27113 of 2024       (Judgment) 
 
 
3 
educational purposes.    
3.  
 
Barrister Maryyam Hayat, learned Amicus 
Curiae has stated that in case titled “Mst. Sidra Asif Versus 
Additional District Judge and 2 Others” (2019 YLR 2692) 
it has already been observed that in guardianship cases, the 
Courts exercise parental jurisdiction and stand in loco 
parentis, thus, the jurisdiction could not be hampered with 
undue interference of technicalities. Therefore, the Court 
must perform its legal duties to regulate the custody of the 
minor in order to ensure his well-being and welfare which 
should be paramount and dominant consideration. She 
further stated that it was held in the case titled “Raja 
Muhammad Owais Versus Mst. Nazia Jabeen and Others” 
(2022 SCMR 2123) that Court‟s jurisdiction in custody 
cases is in the form of parental jurisdiction which means that 
the Courts should not only consider all factors including 
physical and emotional needs, medical care but also relevant 
is the parent‟s ability to provide a safe and secure home 
where the quality of the relationship between the  child and 
each parent is comfortable for the child, however, the 
learned Guardian Court has ignored the same. It is further 
stated that the intent of the legislature behind section 26 of 
the Act of 1890 is to protect interest of the non-custodial 
parent by imposing limits on removing children from 
jurisdiction; that the said section is not applicable here as the 
respondent-father was proceeded against ex-parte in both the 
forums below, which essentially shows that the respondent-
father is not interested in meeting the minor, thus, the 
protection of section 26 of the Act of 1890 is not applicable. 
She has further stated that the respondent-father is resident 
of USA and does not even reside within the local limits of 
the Court, therefore, the apprehensions disclosed by the 

 
Writ Petition No. 27113 of 2024       (Judgment) 
 
 
4 
learned Courts below are not rational and judicious. She has 
apprised that the minor can have better education and 
financial conditions in USA.  
4.  
 
Heard. Record perused. 
5.  
 
In “Scherazade Jamali” case (supra) the 
learned Sindh High Court resolved the issue as to the 
restriction on the movement of a ward out of the jurisdiction, 
as contained in section 26 of the Act of 1890, while 
observing that the ward cannot be penalized for the dispute 
between the parents and if better education facilities or 
institutions are available in any part of the world including 
Pakistan, there is no justifiable reason that the ward should 
be deprived to have access to such institutions or facilities. 
The same is categorized as psychological trauma to the 
ward, while further observing that the Courts below should 
not view the welfare only from the angle that father must not 
miss the opportunity to see his child but at the same time it 
should be seen as to whether the child is capable of studying 
abroad. The Court in the said case concluded as follows:- 
“…Welfare of the minor includes his 
material, intellectual, moral and spiritual well 
being. In accomplishment of such object it 
becomes the duty of the Court to take care of 
the ward's welfare and shall ensure that the 
litigating parents are not disputing to settle 
their own score or to satisfy vanity or even to 
soothe his/her craving of love and affection 
for minor as it could only he done if the 
welfare of the ward demands. Guardian 
Courts sometime lose sight of the welfare of 
the ward when love and affection is 
demonstrated by parentswhich is considered as 
overriding effect. True love of mother and 
father no doubt is important but what is more 
important is the welfare of the ward and it 
should not be limited to any one's right of 
custody, but a larger view is to be taken from 

 
Writ Petition No. 27113 of 2024       (Judgment) 
 
 
5 
ward's point of view. 
 
No doubt father is a natural guardian 
and any decision that concerns material, 
intellectual, moral or spiritual well being is 
always a father's prerogative, but such can 
always be maintained and achieved in case the 
custody remains with mother. There are 
occasions when both parents or at times even 
the environment that they have is not 
considered as conducive for ward, custody and 
supervision may be entrusted to foster 
parents….” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
6.  
 
In the present case, respondent-father has not 
shown any interest in the visitation schedule framed by the 
learned Guardian Court. It has been apprised that no 
concern is being demonstrated by the respondent-father in 
contributing towards the welfare of the minor. Throughout 
the case before the learned Guardian Court, learned 
Appellate Court or this Court the respondent-father has not 
even joined the proceedings. In “Dr. Aisha Yousuf” case 
(supra) the custodial parent / mother obtained job in Dubai 
and she requested the learned Court to permit her to take the 
ward to Dubai. The learned Court found the request 
reasonable and permitted her to take the ward out of the 
jurisdiction, while allowing the Constitution Petition. It will 
be beneficial to reproduce paragraph No. 12 of the said 
judgment:- 
“12.   In the present case two Court 
below have concurrently held that the custody 
shall remain with the mother and father has 
not challenged such findings. Therefore, as far 
as question of custody of the minor is 
concerned there does not appear to be any 
dispute 
between 
the 
parties. 
Regarding 
visitation rights the two Courts below have 
concurrently held that from 6-00 p.m. of 
alternate Saturday to 6-00 p.m. of following 
Sunday baby girl will be with the father. It is 

 
Writ Petition No. 27113 of 2024       (Judgment) 
 
 
6 
stated by learned counsel for the petitioner that 
mother is doctor by profession and she has 
obtained a job in Dubai and therefore prayed 
that she be allowed to take the baby to Dubai. 
The requests seems to be perfectly reasonable. 
Just as a father cannot be asked to abandon his 
career if he wants custody of a child, a mother 
cannot be asked to forsake her career if she 
wants custody of the child. In these days a 
woman is equally entitled to pursue a fruitful 
rewarding and satisfying career. Gone are the 
day when social norms used to be that a 
woman is expected to remain within four walls 
of a house and bring up children and father 
was free to roam the world in search of 
livelihood. Mandate' of the Constitution as 
contained in Article 25 is that the State can 
make law for the protection and welfare of 
women and children. The Supreme Court has 
in Shrin Munir and others v. Government of 
Punjab through Secretary Health, Lahore and 
another, PLD 1990 SC (sic) held that while it 
is permissible to practice discrimination in 
favour of women and children but it is 
forbidden against them. Therefore spirit 
underlining all the legislation has to be that if 
anything the Court should lean in favour of 
weaker sections of society and it does not need 
any sophistry of arguments to see that women 
in this society, besides others, are certainly 
weaker section. Therefore, a female has as 
much right to roam in search of career and 
livelihood wherever she finds it more apt and 
she cannot be deprived of custody of the 
children for mere reason that she wants to 
serve abroad. Therefore, in my opinion it 
would be fair and reasonable to permit the 
mother to take the child out of Pakistan along 
with her when she goes to Dubai for her 
employment.”  
       (Underlining is added) 
7.  
 
In C.P. No. S-411 of 2022 titled “Gul Mina 
Afridi Versus Rana Abdul Kareem & Others” the Sindh 
High Court referred to a judgment of Karnataka High Court 
in WP No. 892 of 2023 titled SmtRakshitha vs Sri C C 
Shashikumar passed on 19 January, 2023, where the 

 
Writ Petition No. 27113 of 2024       (Judgment) 
 
 
7 
permission was granted to mother on the ground that father 
was indolent and he was uninvolved in the matters of 
upbringing of the ward. Reliance in the said case was also 
placed upon the American jurisprudence and case titled 
Watson V. Watson (Aug 03, 2004 I 2004 Neb. App. LEXIS 
190) in which the Court granted mother‟s motion to remove 
minor children from Nebraska to pursue her job opportunity 
in Maryland. Here, I would like to reproduce paragraphs No. 
8 and 9 of the said judgment:- 
“8.  Admittedly the world is a global 
village and countless people are migrating 
overseas 
for 
better 
opportunities 
for 
themselves and especially their children. While 
so far our legal jurisprudence has sparingly 
dealt with the situations where the minor was 
being removed from the jurisdiction of the 
court where the consideration remained the 
protection of the welfare of the minor, 
however, considering the facts of the present 
case where the petitioner's reason of seeking 
permission for international travel is for her 
daughter to have intentional exposure, the 
courts of law aligned with the international 
law, in my humble view, are bound to consider 
that while allowing/denying the permission, 
whether they are protecting the welfare of the 
minor or acting otherwise. This responsibility 
stems from the International Convention of the 
Rights of Child ("Convention") which was 
ratified by Pakistan on 12 November 1990, 
where 
Article 
3 
reinforces 
the 
said 
responsibility in the following words as 
reproduced herein below: 
Article 3 
1. In all actions concerning children, 
whether undertaken by public or private 
social welfare institutions, courts of law, 
administrative authorities or legislative 
bodies, the best Interests of the child 
shall be a primary consideration. 
9.  
Pakistan is also a party to three other 
international instruments aiming at directly or 
indirectly Improving the rights of the child, 

 
Writ Petition No. 27113 of 2024       (Judgment) 
 
 
8 
those being the Convention for the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 
(CEDAW), ratified in 1996; the Declaration 
and Agenda for Action adopted at the issue of 
the World Congress against Commercial 
Sexual Exploitation of Children, signed in 
1996, and reaffirmed by the Yokohama Global 
Commitment in 2001, and the Convention 
concerning the Prohibition and Immediate 
Action for the Elimination of the Worst Form 
of Child Labour Convention, ratified in 2001, 
all of which make the Interest of the child of 
primary consideration and through which our 
Family Courts are bound to make decisions 
that do justice to the principle of welfare of the 
child. 
8.  
 
Now coming to the reasoning given by the 
learned Appellate Court for not being persuaded from the 
judgments in cases titled “Dr. Aisha Yousuf” and 
“Scherazade Jamali” (supra) or withholding permission to 
take the minor abroad. The learned Appellate Court has 
observed that in these judgments section 26 of the Act of 
1890 has not been declared as ultra vires. Section 26 of the 
Act of 1890 reads as under:- 
  
“26. Removal of ward from jurisdiction.--- 
(1) A guardian of the person appointed 
or declared by the Court, unless he is the 
Collector or is a guardian appointed by will or 
other instrument, shall not without the leave 
of the Court by which he was appointed or 
declared, remove the ward from the limits of 
its jurisdiction except for such purposes as 
may be prescribed. 
(2)The leave granted by the Court 
under sub-section (1) may be special or 
general, and may be denied by the order 
granting it.” 
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
 
From a plain reading of above, I do not see any 
intention of the legislature to place complete embargo on 

 
Writ Petition No. 27113 of 2024       (Judgment) 
 
 
9 
granting permission to restrict ward within jurisdiction. 
Otherwise, the Courts would not have been empowered to 
grant leave to take the ward out of the territorial 
jurisdiction. Sub-section 2 of the above permits the Courts 
to grant special or general leave and to deny the leave. The 
learned Appellate Court is correct in its decision that the 
above provisions are holding the field; however, ignored 
that the requirement of leave before removing is also for the 
wellbeing of the ward and protecting the interest of the 
ward as well as the non-custodial parents. Such leave can be 
granted, on case to case basis, when welfare of the ward so 
demands and being exceedingly cautious in using this 
power. I agree with Barrister Marryam Hayat (the learned 
Amicus Curiae) who stated that the learned Appellate Court 
should have proceeded to give findings on merits of the 
case by considering the request to permit the petitioner-
mother to take the minor to USA for education purposes, 
instead of making the mother or the minor to go through 
further rigors. The learned counsel for the petitioner has 
submitted that already harm to the education of the minor 
has been caused and referring the matter by learned 
Appellate Court to the learned Guardian Court can further 
results into damage and / or loss of an academic year.         
9.  
 
After carefully going through the available 
documents and hearing the arguments, I am of the opinion 
that the learned Appellate Court has not exercised the 
jurisdiction conferred by law to properly consider the 
request of the petitioner. It has been ignored that the 
respondent-father is not taking any interest or contributing 
for the welfare of the minor and his complete failure in 
observing the visitation schedule, framed by the learned 
Guardian Court. I do not consider it in the welfare of the 

 
Writ Petition No. 27113 of 2024       (Judgment) 
 
 
10 
minor to deprive him from joining his educational 
institution in USA, restricting him within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the learned Guardian Court, in the 
circumstances of the case. It is considered appropriate to 
permit the custodial-parent / mother to take the minor to 
USA for education purposes. Barrister Syeda Maqsooma 
Zahra has submitted that the petitioner-mother undertakes 
that prior to change of residential address or educational 
institution, information of the same in such eventuality shall 
be given to the learned Guardian Court. 
10.  
 
In view of the above, the petitioner-mother is 
allowed to take the minor to USA for educational purposes 
and the judgment of the learned Appellate Court to this 
extent is modified. In case of breach of undertaking or any 
other relevant condition imposed by learned Guardian 
Court, 
respondent-father 
can 
approach 
the 
learned 
Guardian Court for cancellation of the permission granted. 
Petitioner to appear before the learned Guardian Court for 
intimation about her present residence address and name as 
well as address of educational institution of the minor in 
USA.  
11. 
 
Allowed in the above terms.
