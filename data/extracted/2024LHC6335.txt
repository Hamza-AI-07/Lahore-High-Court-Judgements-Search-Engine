  Anwaar Hussain, J.  Though this single judgment, the present 
as well as connected constitutional petition, bearing W.P. No.905 of 
2020, are being simultaneously decided as both are directed against 
the common judgment, passed by the Appellate Court below, in the 
matter emanating from the suit, inter alia, for recovery of dower and 
dowry articles of respondent No.1 as well as maintenance of 
respondents No.1 and 2 (“the respondents”), who are petitioners of 
the connected petition. The petitioner, in present case, is father of 
respondent No. 2 (“the minor”) and ex-husband of respondent No.1.

2. 
By way of factual background, it has been noted that the 
petitioner and respondent No.1, were married on 10.05.2014. The 
petitioner was working at Qatar and the family thus moved to Qatar. 
Soon differences developed between the parties and the suit was 
instituted by respondent No.1, for recovery of her maintenance 
allowance @ Rs. 55,000 per month since 28.09.2015 and at the same 
rate for future period with 20% enhancement and Rs. 35,000 per 
month for the minor since 28.09.2015, and at the same rate for the 
future period with 20% enhancement. Respondent No.1 also sought 
recovery of dower, gold ornaments and dowry articles. During the 
pendency of the suit, the petitioner and respondent No.1 got 
divorced and the marriage was dissolved on 12.07.2018. Through 
judgment dated 04.10.2019, the Trial Court decreed the suit. 
Respondent No.1 was held entitled to recover maintenance 
allowance @ Rs. 15,000 per month from the date of institution of 
suit till the end of her iddat period, while the minor was held entitled 
to get maintenance allowance @ Rs. 30,000 from institution of suit 
till her legal entitlement with 10% annual increase. The Trial Court 
relied upon the employment contract of the petitioner, produced by 
respondent No.1/the plaintiff (Mark P/1). Respondent No. 1 was 
held entitled to dowry articles as per list produced by her or in 
alternate Rs. 500,000/. Her claim for gold ornaments was declined. 
Both sides preferred appeals, which were dismissed, vide judgment 
and decree dated 19.02.2020.  
3. 
The petitioner has laid challenge to the quantum of 
maintenance, awarded to the minor, at the rate of Rs.30,000/- per 
month with 10% annual increment, on the ground that the said 
amount was fixed by the Trial Court, on the basis of the employment 
contract of the petitioner that was brought on record as ‘Mark-P/1’, 
which depicted 14,500 Qatari Rayal as monthly salary of the 
petitioner, however, his financial means underwent material adverse 
change inasmuch as the petitioner is now drawing merely an 
aggregate salary of 7,000 Qatari Rayal but the relevant documents 

3 
W.P. No.819 of 2020 
 
 
were not taken into consideration by the Appellate Court below, on 
the ground that the same are not attested by the Pakistan Embassy in 
Doha, Qatar.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents submitted 
that the quantum of maintenance awarded to respondent No.1 till her 
iddat period and depreciation calculated in determining alternate 
value of dowry articles are to be reconsidered and revised as 
respondent No.1 remained settled in the house of the petitioner for 
just one year. As regards quantum of maintenance of the minor, 
submitted that law only envisages the enhancement of maintenance 
and not reduction thereof. Further contends that even if the averment 
of the petitioner regarding changed circumstances and salary of the 
petitioner @ 7,000 Qatari Rayal per month is taken as correct, the 
said amount, when converted in Pakistani currency, comes to 
Rs.500,000/- approximately, which does not render the maintenance 
fixed exorbitant. Added that the claim of respondent No.1 in respect 
of the gold ornaments was also wrongly declined. 
5. 
In rebuttal, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that if 
the maintenance fixed by the Courts below is upheld, at present, the 
same would come around Rs.64,300/-, approximately, after 
including the annual increment, which is exorbitant keeping in view 
the fact that the petitioner was earlier drawing 14,500 Qatari Rayal, 
as monthly salary, in addition to an accommodation provided by the 
employer in Qatar, whereas at present, he is drawing 7,000 Qatari 
Rayal, lump sum whereby the petitioner has to also arrange the 
accommodation on his own. 
6. 
On Court’s call, learned Law Officer submitted that the appeal 
is continuity of the trial, and therefore, the petitioner should have 
been given an opportunity to establish his financial position in order 
to balance rights of the parties. Further submitted that though the 
family laws are interpreted in a manner which are beneficial to the 
female side being weaker segment of the society, the same is not a 

4 
W.P. No.819 of 2020 
 
 
rule of thumb and the Courts are obligated to strike a balance 
between the rights of the parties, in a judicious manner. 
7. 
Mr. Shahab Qutub, Advocate Supreme Court was appointed 
as amicus curiae. He submitted that the maintenance is to be fixed in 
proportionate to the financial resources of the father, which can 
subsequently be increased and/or decreased according to the change 
in the financial means of the father as striking a balance between the 
financial means of father and needs of a minor is the overarching 
object of law. Further submitted that financially penalizing the father 
in the garb of maintenance is against the policy and is to be avoided.  
8. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
9. 
This Court is invited to answer following legal questions: 
i. Whether depreciation in the value of dowry articles, 
during the period of pendency of a suit for their 
recovery, could be imposed on the female?  
ii. Whether a father can be burdened beyond his 
financial means, in determining the quantum of 
maintenance of a child; and 
iii. Whether the maintenance of a child, once fixed, can 
be reduced with the adverse change in the financial 
means of the father? 
 
10. 
Before addressing the above formulated legal questions, it 
will be appropriate to address the claim of respondent No.1 in 
respect of the gold ornaments and her maintenance, during iddat 
period. The findings in this regard are concurrent in nature. No 
misreading or non-reading of evidence could be pointed out in 
respect of the said findings. Maintenance (of Rs. 15,000/-) awarded 
to respondent No.1 for her iddat period is reasonable and hence, 
does not merit any interference.   
11. 
Adverting to the nub of the matter and taking up the first legal 
question, it is pertinent to observe that the depreciation of dowry 
articles for a period of pendency of the suit cannot be imposed on a 
female/plaintiff if the husband/defendant-the petitioner in present 

5 
W.P. No.819 of 2020 
 
 
case, in the written statement, does not admit giving of such dowry 
articles, enabling the wife-plaintiff to lift the same. If depreciation of 
the dowry articles for such a period is forced upon a female while 
calculating the alternate value of dowry articles, this would amount 
to putting a premium on the conduct of the husband who withheld 
the dowry articles, depriving the female of her belongings for the 
period during which the suit remained pending, on account of not 
admitting the claim of the female straightaway. Therefore, as a 
measure of equity, the Courts are obligated to place the parties at a 
position they should be at the time when they approach the Court 
and not at a position at which they are when the Court adjudicate 
their dispute(s). In the instant case, the petitioner/defendant in his 
written statement, in reply to para No. 3 of the plaint, stated as 
under: 
“Para No. 3 is incorrect as stated, hence, denied. 
However, some dowry articles were given to the 
plaintiff by her parents same were lying at the 
house of the defendant and defendant is ready to 
return the same but the plaintiff claim exorbitant 
dower (sic) from the defendant” 
The above quoted response on part of the petitioner shows that the 
petitioner/defendant did not straightaway admit the claim of 
respondent No.1/the plaintiff, rather, vaguely controverted the 
same by stating that few dowry articles were given to her which 
are lying with him albeit without giving any detail. Consequently, 
it took the Court four years to adjudicate the issue of dowry 
articles. Therefore, while decreeing the suit to this extent, the 
Trial Court erroneously imposed depreciation on respondent 
No.1/the plaintiff as it awarded alternate value while considering 
depreciation for a period of five years whereas respondent 
No.1/the plaintiff remained in possession of her dowry articles for 
a period of only one year, while in her marital abode, and the suit 
remained pending for four years as the petitioner/defendant did 
not admit the claim to dowry articles, straightaway. Even the 
admission made in respect of the giving of dowry article, as stated  

6 
W.P. No.819 of 2020 
 
 
above, was ambiguous as he did not tender any list of dowry articles 
which were in his possession. The admission made by the petitioner 
was so vague as not to afford any certainty to respondent No.1/the 
plaintiff to lift admitted dowry articles. Thus, the Courts below were 
in mistake in calculating depreciation for a period during which suit 
remained pending. 
12. 
Adverting to the second question, it is imperative to observe 
that, as regards Muslim citizens, the law of maintenance in Pakistan 
is based on the principles of Muslim personal law2 derived from 
Shariah of which the two primary sources are the Holy Quran and 
Sunnah. In Islamic Law, maintenance is termed as Nafqah3, which 
means what a person spends on his family4. The father’s duty to 
maintain his children arises out of guardianship and is distinct from 
his duty to maintain his wife. In Islamic law, a minor’s guardianship 
vests with the father unless the interests of the child demand 
otherwise. The responsibility of maintenance is on the father and 
varies according to his financial status. Maintenance includes food, 
clothing, lodging, education and other necessary expenses of a child 
from birth until adulthood. It is a religious as well as legal duty of a 
father5. The fact that the children are in the custody of their mother 
does not relieve the father from the obligation of maintaining them6. 
The source of the aforesaid obligation is found first and foremost in 
the Holy Quran. Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala (ٰ تعالى و سبحانه) in Surah 
Al-Baqra ordained as under: 
“233. The mothers shall give suck to their offspring 
for two whole years if the father desires to complete 
the term. But he shall bear the cost of their food 
and clothing on equitable terms. No soul shall have

a burden laid on it greater than it can bear. No 
mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her 
child nor father on account of his child. An heir shall 
be chargeable in the same way if they both decide on 
weaning by 
mutual consent and after due 
consultation there is no blame on them. If ye decide 
on a foster-mother for your offspring there is no 
blame on you provided ye pay (the mother) what ye 
offered on equitable terms. But fear God and know 
that God sees well what ye do.” 
 
The above quoted Verse of the Holy Quran places an 
obligation on the father to provide maintenance for his children, 
according to his means. The Verse clearly acknowledges that not all 
fathers can provide equally since one must do so honourably – to an 
honourable or morally acceptable level, which is reinforced by the 
recognition that no soul is tasked beyond its capacity more 
particularly when read with Verse 7 of Surah Talaq7. The above 
quoted Verses of the Holy Quran are the source of the religious 
obligation of a father to maintain his children, however, it is well 
evident that such obligation is to commensurate with his resources.  
13. 
As regards the legal framework of awarding maintenance, 
Section 5 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 (“the Act”), read with 
item No. 3 of Part I of the Schedule thereto, grants exclusive 
jurisdiction to the Family Courts to adjudicate cases related to 
maintenance. Section 17-A of the Act provides that Family Courts 
can pass interim orders for maintenance at any stage during the 
proceedings, ensuring that the financial needs of the minor(s) and 
the wife (depending on the circumstances of the case) are met 
promptly. Section 17-A was amended in the Punjab through the 
Family Courts (Amendment) Act, 2015, whereby in addition to the 
Court’s power to grant interim maintenance, the Family Court was 
also empowered to, inter alia, prescribe an annual increase in the 
amount of maintenance and if such increase is not prescribed, the 
maintenance shall automatically stand increased at the rate of ten

percent each year. Significantly, sub-section (4) of Section 17-A of 
the Act gives the Court the authority and power to summon relevant 
documentary evidence from any organization body or authority to 
determine the estate and resources of the defendant. Similarly, 
Section 9 (1A) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (“the 
Ordinance”) states that if a father fails to maintain his child, the 
mother or grandmother of the child may, in addition to seeking any 
other legal remedy, apply to the Chairman8 who shall constitute an 
Arbitration Council9, which may issue a certificate specifying the 
amount that shall be paid by the father as maintenance of the child. 
As is clear from the text of the legal provisions referred hereinabove, 
the Courts in Pakistan have also taken a very clear view that the 
father’s responsibility to maintain his children is a religious, moral 
and legal obligation while at the same time the right of the children 
to be maintained by their father is a legal, religious and natural right. 
In a number of judgments, the Courts have consistently taken a strict 
view of a father’s attempt to avoid the aforesaid obligation and have 
intervened whenever a father has been found to be negligent in 
meeting his responsibilities.10 Thus, it is judicially settled by now 
that a father cannot be allowed to avoid his responsibility simply by 
saying that he does not have resources11 or that he is not a person of 
means12 or that he has other dependents13. 
                                                          
8 In terms of Section 2(b) of the Ordinance, “Chairman” means the Chairman of the Union 
Council or a person appointed by the Federal Government in the Cantonment areas or by the 
Provincial Government in other areas or by an Officer authorized in that behalf by any such 
Government to discharge the functions of chairman under this Ordinance: 
 
Provided that where the Chairman of the Union Council is a non-Muslim, or he himself 
wishes to make an application to the Arbitration Council, or is, owing to illness or any other 
reason, unable to discharge the functions of Chairman, the Council shall elect one of its Muslim 
members as Chairman for the purposes of this Ordinance.  
9 In terms of Section 2(a) of the Ordinance, “Arbitration Council” means a body consisting of 
the Chairman and a representative of each of the parties to a matter dealt with in this 
Ordinance: 
 
Provided that where any party fails to nominate a representative within the 
prescribed time, the body formed without such representative shall be the Arbitration Council.

However, it is important to note that deterring a father from 
avoiding his legal obligations on the pretext of financial limitations 
and determination of the quantum of maintenance are two different 
aspects to be considered and adjudicated. The latter requires 
emphasis on a balanced and evidence-based approach i.e., a balance 
between the needs of the minor and the financial capacity of the 
father. In a suit for recovery of the maintenance, the foremost duty 
of the Court is to determine the quantum of maintenance since the 
entitlement to maintenance, particularly with respect to the children, 
is very rarely disputed. However, determining the quantum of the 
maintenance, is a fact-sensitive exercise, where a balance has to be 
struck between the needs of the minor and the financial capacity of 
the father. This approach emanates from the Islamic sources cited 
above, where the obligation of the father is to maintain his children 
in a dignified and honourable manner while at the same time 
recognizing that no one should be burdened beyond his capacity. 
However, what are the needs of the minor and what is the financial 
capacity of the father is to be determined on the basis of evidence 
while keeping in view that such determination cannot be static given 
that the needs of the minor and the financial capacity of the father 
can also change over time. The Islamabad High Court has delineated 
the factors that are to be considered by the Courts in determining the 
quantum of maintenance including the types of evidence that would 
ordinarily be required to prove those factors14. While case of 
Muhammad Touseeq Danial Bhatti supra relates to interim 
maintenance, in my view, several (if not all) of the principles/factors 
enunciated therein can also be applied to the determination of the 
final maintenance amount. For instance, the financial status of the 
father should be based upon salary slip(s), bank statement(s), income 
tax record, and business income reflected on record or through any 
other documentary proof placed by either side in the Court; the 
needs of minor should be considered on the basis of social

stratification of family in which minor has been brought up; in cases, 
where father being civil servant or employee of any organization, 
department or company has not appended his salary slips or bank 
statements, the Court shall ask for an undertaking or affidavit 
regarding his salary and thereafter shall fix the interim maintenance, 
however after the trial of the case, if the Court comes to the 
conclusion that at the time of fixation of interim maintenance 
allowance the father/husband has stated a fact beyond his pleadings 
or undertaking, which is found to be false, such father be burdened 
with heavy costs and action of perjury may also be initiated against 
him. Moreover, the need to strike such a balance has also been 
highlighted in number of reported judgments15. In case of Humayun 
Hassan supra, the Supreme Court held as under: 
“4. Heard. There can be no cavil with the 
proposition that the maintenance issue(s), in relation 
to Muslim relatives shall be governed and regulated 
by the principles/injunctions of Islam i.e. as per the 
personal law of the parties. In this context, according 
to section 369 of the Muhammadan Law by D.F. 
Mullah, maintenance means and includes food, 
raiment and lodging. However, it may be observed 
that from the very language of the above section, 
such definition is neither conclusive nor exhaustive, 
and in our view it undoubtedly has a wider 
connotation and should be given an extended 
meaning, for the purposes of meeting and catering 
for the present days social, physical, mental growth, 
upbringing and well-being of the minor, keeping in 
mind the status of the family, the norms of the 
society and his educational requirement, which has 
now attained utmost importance[1]; but obviously 
corresponding to and commensurating with the 
means and the capacity of the father to pay.”  
 
 
 
 
 
            (Emphasis supplied) 
It follows from the above referred judgments that in determining 
maintenance, the Court has to strike a balance between the needs of 
the minor and the earning capacity of the father. The object of the

141); Humayun Hassan supra 2.  

11 
W.P. No.819 of 2020 
 
 
law, no doubt, is to provide financial security to children and to 
ensure that a father does not avoid his legal, moral and religious 
obligation to maintain his children, however, the purpose is certainly 
not to penalize the father or to place a burden on him, greater than he 
can actually bear. It has been held that “Islam does not compel a 
person to do an act beyond his capacity, therefore, social status of 
the petitioner and level of legitimate financial sources which are 
eminent factors for deciding the quantum of maintenance shall not 
be ignored”16. The Courts in determining the quantum of 
maintenance cannot act in an arbitrary and whimsical manner and 
the quantum of maintenance should be reasonable having regard to 
the evidence on record in respect of the financial resources of the 
father and the needs of the minor. Maintenance that is oppressive to 
the father (i.e., beyond his proven financial capacity) turns into 
financial penalization of the father, which is improper and against 
the spirit and policy of the law as such unbearable financial burden 
on father that may disable him to fulfil his other financial and social 
obligations.  
 
Hence, the second question is answered in a manner that a 
father cannot be burdened beyond his financial means with his 
obligation to maintain bordering on and/or amounting to financial 
oppression and/or penalization. The Courts are obligated to strike a 
balance between the financial means of the father and financial 
needs of the minor.    
15. 
The answer to third question also lies in the discussion in 
respect of the second question. The principle of striking a balance is 
applicable throughout and the Appellate Court below is required to 
maintain this balance. Moreover, this Court is of the view that the 
maintenance as also the financial resources is not a static rather 
changing phenomenon. The financial means of father as well as

12 
W.P. No.819 of 2020 
 
 
financial needs of the minor may undergo change positively, 
adversely and/or inversely as well. The Court, in determining the 
quantum of maintenance, cannot act in an arbitrary manner but 
should in fact carry out an evidence-based exercise to determine the 
needs of the minor and the financial capacity of the father in terms 
of his earnings and assets etc. It is equally clear that fixation of an 
oppressive or over burdensome quantum of maintenance, without 
regard to the father’s sources of income, is also improper and cannot 
be allowed. In this regard, the Supreme Court of Pakistan17 held as 
under: 
“9. …. the Family Court is under an obligation while 
granting the maintenance allowance, to keep in mind 
the financial condition and status of the father. It has 
to make an inquiry in this regard. It cannot act 
arbitrarily or whimsically. Furthermore, at the same 
time, the unjust enrichment of the minors cannot be 
permitted at the cost of the father”. 
 
 
 
 
            
  (Emphasis supplied) 
In application of the principles emanating out of the above 
discussion, it may be stated that while the maintenance can be 
enhanced and is enhanced statutorily and/or by decree of the Court, 
the same can be reduced as well with the changed financial 
circumstances of the father. 
16. 
Having above analysis in sight, the facts of the present case 
need to be re-visited. It is important to note that the quantum of the 
petitioner’s earning was not at dispute between the parties in 
2015/2016 when the suit was instituted by the respondents and the 
written statement was filed by the petitioner. The respondents 
asserted and the petitioner could not refute that his income at the 
relevant time was 14,500 Qatari Riyals. However, the suit was 
decided in 2019 by which time, the petitioner alleges that his 
circumstances had changed. Before making further comments on the 
factual aspects of this case, it is pertinent to observe that family as a

760).

whole, in the absence of its disintegration on account of 
dissolution of marriage between spouses, sails through ebb and 
flow of life as a unit and all the members of the family weather 
the storm by holding their hands together. Therefore, under a 
normal situation, where parents are not separated or the child is 
living with a custodial parent/father, the family/mother and the 
children, as the case may be, would have easily adjusted to the 
change brought into their lives on account of the financial distress 
of 
a 
father resulting 
into 
cutting 
unnecessary 
expenses, 
prioritizing basic needs, and maintaining a positive family 
dynamic to navigate the challenges together, in order to foster a 
sense of shared responsibility and simply because the parents (the 
petitioner and respondent No.1) have decided to separate does not 
mean that adverse change in financial means, of the father-the 
petitioner, should not be seen with positive approach by 
respondent No. 1 or the minor. This social aspect of the matter 
must be kept in sight by the Courts while fixing or re-fixing, 
increasing or decreasing the amount of the maintenance. The 
petitioner did assert in his testimonial evidence that his work was 
project based and that he was not employed when there was no 
project, however, this was a mere assertion and no documentary 
proof was presented at the time of trial to substantiate this fact. 
The Trial Court, therefore, relied on the employment contract 
(Mark P/1) submitted by the respondents to determine the income 
of the petitioner, which was not denied and/or disputed by the 
petitioner at that time and thus, the said Court acted on the basis 
of the documentary evidence before it. However, in appeal, the 
petitioner did make an attempt to bring on record additional 
evidence including an employment contract, which according  
to the petitioner demonstrated that he did not have the  
same earning capacity as he did in the year 2015 and that his

however, did not allow those documents to be brought on record for 
two reasons; firstly, it observed that the petitioner had already made 
an admission in his written statement as regards the quantum of 
income; and secondly, that the documents being sought to be 
brought on record had not been attested by the Pakistan Embassy, 
Doha. This Court is of the view that the Appellate Court below fell 
in error in its reasoning and approach. Firstly, the fact that an 
admission had been made by the petitioner as regards his income in 
2016 did not mean that the petitioner’s circumstances could not have 
changed subsequently. The determination of maintenance was being 
made some four years after the institution of the suit and the 
admission made therein and the Appellate Court below ought not to 
have disregarded this material fact. Secondly, disallowing the 
admissibility of all documents on the ground that they were not 
attested by the Pakistan Embassy without discussing the relevant law 
and how it applied to each of the documents sought to be brought on 
record, was also not justified. There is nothing that bars the 
admissibility of a private document (sought to be brought on record 
by the petitioner), which the petitioner claims to be original, because 
it has not been attested by the Pakistan Embassy. It is pertinent to 
mention that respondent No.1/the plaintiff was allowed to produce 
an employment contract of the petitioner in evidence that was relied 
upon by the Trial Court in its judgment (Mark P/1). Furthermore, it 
has been held that although the provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order are not as such applicable to the proceedings of family cases, 
yet the Act empowers the Court to make its own assessment18. The 
Appellate Court’s judgment did not provide valid grounds for 
disallowing the admissibility of the documents sought to be brought 
on record by the petitioner losing the sight of Section 17-A (4) of the 
Act, which confers authority and power upon the Court to summon 
relevant documentary evidence from any organization, body or

authority to determine the estate and resources of the defendant. This 
provision underscores the importance of determining through cogent 
and concrete evidence the financial status of the husband/father by 
the Court where the Court is not limited to the evidence led by the 
parties but can go further and obtain such information from the 
relevant authorities itself. It is, therefore, clear that the Court is 
required to make every effort, even if it entails obtaining information 
on its own, to determine the sources of income of the 
husband/father19. Needless to mention that question regarding proof 
of the documents, their contents and their evidentiary value could all 
be determined and assessed by the Court, once they had been 
brought on record. It has been held by this Court that an Appellate 
Court hearing an appeal under Section 14 of the Act has the power 
to call for additional evidence should it deem necessary20. I am of 
considered opinion that this was a fit case for allowing additional 
evidence to be produced as regards the financial status and earning 
capacity of the petitioner given the passage of time since the 
institution of the suit. Furthermore, this would also be in accord with 
the principles discussed above whereby the husband/father has to 
make a full disclosure regarding his source of income and if he 
wishes to bring such evidence on record then the Court should adopt 
a liberal approach in this respect. It is reiterated that allowing the 
documents to be brought on record does not preclude the Court from 
assessing the documents and forming a view as regards their 
evidentiary value. Such an exercise would also be in accord with the 
Court’s paramount duty to determine the financial status of the 
husband/father on the basis of cogent, tangible and reliable evidence.

In view of the above discussion, both the petitions are 
partially accepted. Findings to the extent of maintenance of the 
minor as well as the alternate value of dowry articles are set aside

decision afresh in respect of the maintenance of the minor and 
determination of the alternate value of the dowry articles with the 
observation that matter be decided expeditiously preferably within a
