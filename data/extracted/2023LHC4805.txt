W.P.No.2362 of 2017 
 
       2 
committee to probe into the matter. The Petitioner was charge sheeted 
with statement of allegations on 09.10.2012 and was directed to file 
reply. Once again on 06.11.2012, he was directed to file reply within 
14 days however, the Competent Authority, till completion of inquiry, 
suspended the Petitioner under Regulation 28 of the “Regulations”. 
The Petitioner, used to approach the Courts of law for redressal of his 
grievance however, impugned order dated 07.07.2017 was passed by 
the Respondents pursuant to directions of Supreme Court of Pakistan 
whereby his appeal was dismissed. Hence this petition. 
 
B. 
PETITIONERS’ SUBMISSIONS  
3. 
Mian Abdul Rauf, ASC for the Petitioner inter alia contended 
that the impugned orders have been passed without taking into 
consideration true facts of the case; that the Respondents have neither 
provided copies of inquiry proceedings nor granted him opportunity of 
personal hearing; that neither any explanation was called nor show 
cause notice was given and the inquiry was not conducted as per the 
“Regulations”; that the Respondent No.3 was not authorized to issue 
charge sheet and statement of allegations therefore, all proceedings 
conducted against the petitioner are void ab initio; that the 
Respondents have not complied with the directions of Supreme Court 
of Pakistan while passing impugned order hence the Petitioner be 
reinstated in service by setting aside the same. 
 
C. 
RESPONDENTS SUBMISSIONS 
4. 
Mr. Amir Abdullah Abbasi, ASC for the Respondents, on the 
other hand, filed report and parawise comments, vehemently opposed 
the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the Petitioners and 
prayed for dismissal of the petition on the ground that the Petitioner 
was rightly charge sheeted and a regular inquiry was conducted after 
affording full opportunity to defend his case. He further stated that the 
Petitioner has not filed departmental appeal within time and this 
petition has been filed just to cover the said lacuna.

D. 
DETERMINATION BY THE COURT 
6. 
The Court while deciding moot point, whether the appeal filed 
by the Petitioner was within the time frame of Regulation 33 of the 
“Regulations”, will interpret Regulation 33 of the “Regulations”.  
  
i. 
Background of litigation between the parties 
7. 
Before proceeding further, it would be advantageous to describe 
case history in brief. It was all started when the Petitioner was sent on 
forced leave vide letter dated 31.07.2012 for a period of three months 
w.e.f. 01.08.2012 and vide said order, a committee was constituted to 
probe the matter. The Petitioner was issued charge sheet alongwith 
statement of allegations on 09.10.2012 with direction to file reply 
however, due to failure to file the same, the Petitioner was placed 
under suspension in terms of Regulation 28 of the “Regulations” till 
completion of inquiry. Due to his suspension, the Petitioner’s salary 
was stopped by the Respondents which prompted him to file 
W.P.No.2500 of 2011 before Islamabad High Court, Islamabad and 
ultimately the said writ petition was disposed of as borne fruit vide 
order dated 12.10.2012. Thereafter, the Petitioner, challenged the 
authority of the Respondent No.4 through W.P.No.3774 of 2012 before 
Islamabad High Court, Islamabad which was dismissed vide order 
dated 12.11.2012. This order was assailed by him through 
I.C.A.No.735 of 2012 and vide order dated 05.12.2012, the Division 
Bench ordered that “inquiry proceedings shall continue but no final 
order shall be passed” and ultimately the said I.C.A. was dismissed 
vide judgment dated 04.03.2015. The Competent Authority vide order 
dated 08.04.2015, terminated the Petitioner’s services providing him 
the right of appeal before Appellate Authority within stipulated period 
provided under the “Regulations”. The Petitioner approached this 
Court through W.P.No.1296 of 2015 with the stance that he has not 
been provided the copies of inquiry with supporting documents, 
however, the Court, in terms of order dated 11.05.2015 directed the 

W.P.No.2362 of 2017 
 
       4 
concerned Respondent to provide him copies of inquiry which were 
provided to him on 12.05.2015 (Pages 200 to 240 of the writ petition). 
Afterwards, the Petitioner filed another W.P.No.2413 of 2015 
challenging the dismissal order dated 08.04.2015 which was dismissed 
vide order dated 03.05.2016 with the observation that “during 
pendency of appeal on the same issue, constitutional jurisdiction by 
pre-empting the appellate jurisdiction cannot be exercised” and this 
order was assailed by him through Civil Petition No.2005 of 2016 
which was disposed of on 18.05.2017 with direction to the concerned 
authority to decide Petitioner’s appeal. 
  
ii. 
Interpretation of Regulation 33 of the “Regulations” 
8. 
Pertinently, the Petitioner has impugned two orders i.e. order of 
his dismissal dated 08.04.2015 and the other dated 07.07.2017 which 
was passed pursuant to directions issued by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in C.P.No.2005 of 2016 dated 18.05.2017. The stance of the 
Respondents is that the appeal filed by the Petitioner against his 
dismissal order is time barred whereas the version of the Petitioner is 
that he could not file appeal as he was not provided copies of inquiry 
proceedings for which he had to approach this Court. There is no 
dispute regarding dismissal of the Petitioner in terms of order dated 
08.04.2015. Under the “Regulations”, a right of appeal was provided 
against penalty imposed in terms of Regulation 33 of the “Regulations” 
which reads as under: 
33. 
Appeal.—A staff member on whom a penalty 
has been imposed under these regulations may file an 
appeal before the officer/authority specified against 
the officer/authority imposing penalty as given 
below: 
Officer/Authority 
imposing the penalty 
Officer/Authority to 
whom the appeal shall lie 
 
Superintendent 
Secretary 
Secretary 
President 
President 
Council 
Council 
Federal Government 
 

W.P.No.2362 of 2017 
 
       5 
(2) 
Every appeal shall be submitted within a 
period of 28 days of the communication of the order 
appeal against.  
 
9. 
Above provision of law makes it quite clear that 28 days time is 
provided for filing appeal against the order from its communication. It 
is noted that the impugned dismissal order was passed by the President 
against which the Petitioner had to file appeal within 28 days however, 
he filed appeal before the Council on 11.05.2015 after expiry of 
limitation period. It is also evident that, for provision of inquiry 
proceedings/documents, the Petitioner filed W.P.No.1296 of 2015 on 
11.05.2015 and on the said date, writ petition was disposed of with 
direction to the concerned Respondent to provide copies of the 
documents claimed and that too were provided to the Petitioner on 
12.05.2015 (Page 200 to 240 of the petition). It is interesting to note 
that the Petitioner was fully aware of Regulation 33(2) of the 
“Regulations” which clearly provides exact period of limitation for 
filing the appeal before the concerned authority which he failed to do. 
If the stance taken by the Petitioner is admitted as correct that he was 
not provided the documents/inquiry proceedings which caused delay in 
filing the appeal before the Council on 11.05.2015, even then the said 
exercise could be done by him within the period of limitation rather he 
opted to approach the Court on 11.05.2015 for provision of 
documents/inquiry proceedings after expiry of limitation period. Hence 
this version of the Petitioner is not believable. Reliance is placed on 
“CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY through Director General and 3 
others Versus Mir ZULFIQAR ALI and another” (2016 SCMR 183) 
and “STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN through Governor and another 
Versus IMTIAZ ALI KHAN and others” (2012 SCMR 280). Moreover, 
the law helps the vigilant and not the indolent. Reliance in this regard 
is placed on “AFTAB IQBAL KHAN KHICHI and another Versus 
Messrs UNITED DISTRIBUTORS PAKISTAN LTD. KARACHI” (1999 
SCMR 1326). It is a settled principle of law that when a law describes 
or requires a thing to be done in a particular manner, it should be 

W.P.No.2362 of 2017 
 
       6 
done in that manner or not at all. Reliance in said regard may well 
be placed upon observation in “ATTAULLAH KHAN versus ALI 
AZAM AFRIDI and others” (2023 PLC (C.S) 182). 
10. 
So far as impugned order dated 07.07.2017, is concerned, it was 
passed pursuant to directions of the Supreme Court of Pakistan which 
reads as under: 
“In respect of the same grievance, the Petitioner 
has filed an appeal before Respondent No.1, 
which is pending adjudication. Such appeal is 
provided by the Regulations applicable. The 
Writ Petition filed by the Petitioner before the 
learned High Court was dismissed in view of the 
pendency of such appeal. 
2. 
The learned counsel for the Petitioner 
states that the appeal has not been decided and 
Respondent No.1 is dragging its feet. He submits 
that at this stage, the Petitioner does not press 
this Civil Petition and would be satisfied, if a 
direction is given to Respondent No.1 to decide 
the appeal expeditiously. The request so made 
by 
the 
learned counsel 
appears to 
be 
reasonable. 
3. 
Consequently, this Civil Petition is 
disposed 
of, 
as 
not 
pressed. 
However, 
Respondent No.1 is directed to decide the appeal 
within 30 days after the receipt of this order”. 
 
11. 
It evinces from the impugned order dated 07.07.2017 that the 
Council being an Appellate Authority after ordering a fact-finding 
inquiry on formal inquiry already conducted on the basis of which the 
Petitioner was awarded major penalty of dismissal from service and on 
considering the inquiry reports, it came to the conclusion that the 
penalty imposed upon him by the Authority is well commensurate with 
proved charges. Moreover, all the grounds taken in this petition as well 
as in his appeal were dealt with by the Council and the Petitioner was 
afforded full opportunity of personal hearing as well as right of 
defence but he could not counter the charges/allegations through 
cogent, convincing and confidence inspiring evidence which otherwise 
had been proved. Reliance is placed on “INAM-UL-HAQ Versus 
ALLIED BANK LIMITED and 4 others” (2018 PLC 215). 

W.P.No.2362 of 2017 
 
       7 
12. 
In view of above discussion, I am not inclined to interfere with 
the impugned orders which otherwise have been passed aptly. 
Resultantly, the instant petition stands dismissed.
