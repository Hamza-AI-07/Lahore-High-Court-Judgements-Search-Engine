MASUD ABID NAQVI, J.  
Brief facts necessary for the 
adjudication of this lis are that the plaintiffs/petitioners are 
daughters of late Mohammad Nawaz who divorced the mother of 
plaintiffs/petitioners and contracted second marriage with 
defendant No.1/respondent No.1 namely Farzana Kanwal and the 
defendants No.2 to 4/respondents No. 2 to 4 are son & daughters 
of late Mohammad Nawaz and Farzana Kanwal.  Being daughters 
of late Mohammad Nawaz, the plaintiffs/petitioners filed suit for 
declaration with the averments that suit land was originally 
owned by late Mohammad Nawaz but defendant No.1/respondent 
No.1/step mother of plaintiffs fraudulently transferred the suit 
land with the help of revenue authorities to herself & to her son 
namely Hassan Nawaz/defendant No.2/respondent No.2 through 
Gift Mutations Nos. 12399 & 12410 dated 31.05.2010, which 
was entered/sanctioned during serious illness of late Mohammad 
Nawaz who ultimately died on 19.12.2010, thus deprived not

only 
the 
plaintiffs/petitioners 
but 
also 
her 
real 
daughters/Defendants Nos.3 & 4/respondents Nos.3 & 4 from 
valuable legal rights, guaranteed under the sharia law. After the 
death, the plaintiffs/petitioners inquired about their shares from 
their father’s estate and  this fraudulent act of defendant No.1/ 
respondent No.1 was revealed, hence the instant suit. On her 
behalf and on behalf of defendants No.2 to 4/minors, the 
defendant No.1 filed contested written statement and raised legal 
as well as factual objections. Out of divergent pleadings of the 
parties, issues were framed and learned trial court decreed the 
suit vide judgment and decree dated 30.01.2016. Feeling 
aggrieved, the defendants filed an appeal and learned Additional 
District Judge vide judgment & decree dated 30.10.2018 
accepted the appeal. Being dissatisfied, the petitioners/plaintiffs 
have filed the instant civil revision and challenged the validity of 
the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned 
appellate court. 
2. 
Learned Counsel for the petitioners argued against the 
findings of learned appellate court by discussing in detail the 
pleadings, oral as well as documentary evidence produced by the 
contesting parties and by relying on plethora of judgments 
reported by the Honourable superior courts while learned counsel 
for the respondents fully supported the findings of learned 
appellate court with lengthy arguments and relied on the law 
settled by Honourable superior courts through reported judgments 
on last date of hearing. During the arguments, attention of both 

               C.R.No. 2823-2019

the learned counsels for the parties was drawn by this court about 
proclamation for sale of late Mohammad Nawaz’s owned 
land/suit land by public auction, issued by learned executing 
court in execution of decree, passed in plaintiffs/petitioners’ suit 
for maintenance & all other relevant documents attached with 
petition and its legal effects on the disputed mutations. Today, 
both the learned counsels for the parties have assisted this Court 
with help of documents/orders/proceedings of learned executing 
court. I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the 
parties and minutely gone through the record as well as the 
judgments & decrees of learned courts below. 
3. 
The plaintiffs/petitioners filed a suit for maintenance 
against their father namely late Mohammad Nawaz which was 
decreed by the learned Family Court with the direction to late 
Mohammad Nawaz to pay maintenance amount till the marriages 
of plaintiffs/petitioners which was challenged by late Mohammad 
Nawaz through appeal and same was dismissed by the learned 
appellate court. The challenged decree of learned Family Court 
was also maintained/upheld by the Honourable superior courts. In 
order to enforce/implement the decree, the plaintiffs/petitioners 
filed an execution petition on 12.11.2004 but late Mohammad 
Nawaz/judgment debtor/a police officer opted not to appear 
before learned executing court despite issuance of notices on 
different dates of hearings and ultimately, the learned executing 
court not only issued bailable warrants but also attached the land 
owned by judgment debtor vide order dated 20.01.2007. During 

               C.R.No. 2823-2019 
4 
 
 
 
the pendency of execution petition, learned executing court 
repeatedly issued orders of judgment debtor’s arrest through 
bailable warrants & attachment of his salary. Thereafter 
proclamation of sale of judgment debtor’s owned land/suit land 
was drawn up by the learned executing court for auctioning the 
land on 26.05.2010 with specified place of public auction and 
specified time and the judgment debtor intentionally established 
all possible obstacles/hurdles to disrupt the proceedings  of 
auctioneer appointed by the learned executing court by hurling 
life threats through different persons to court’s appointed 
auctioneer & potential buyers and by managing to start 
hooliganism at the specified place of public auction as per the 
report submitted in court by the court auctioneer and was 
successful in putting up obstructions in smooth auction 
proceedings. Although both the learned counsels for the parties 
fully agree that suit land was attached by the learned executing 
court when the disputed mutations were entered/sanctioned but 
the learned counsel for the respondents vehemently argues that 
the judgment debtor occasionally paid the partial maintenance 
amount(s) to the plaintiffs/petitioners and had no intention to 
prevent the execution of decree, as is evident from the orders of 
learned executing court and non-compliance of the requirements 
of Section 64 of CPC vitiates the order of attachment of judgment 
debtor’s land as well as all the proceedings thereafter of learned 
executing court but has not specifically pointed out the 
irregularities/illegality in court’s proceedings. 

               C.R.No. 2823-2019 
5 
 
 
 
Attachment qua the disputed land was made on 20.01.2007 
by the learned executing court and according to defendants Nos.1 
& 2/respondents Nos.1& 2’s own stance/plea taken in written 
statement, the disputed land was transferred to them through Gift 
Mutations Nos. 12399 & 12410 on 31.05.2010 and attachment 
order was never withdrawn by the learned executing court till the 
execution petition was finally decided on 14.09.2012. Hence, 
disputed gift transactions subsequent to passing of order of 
attachment is ipso facto void and is an attempt by the judgment 
debtor to deprive his minor daughters not only from decreed 
maintenance amount(s) by frustrating the process of law but also 
from their right to inherit.  
There is settled law that in view of Section 17 of the West 
Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964, the provisions of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 and Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 shall 
not apply to the proceedings before a Family Court except 
Sections 10 & 11 CPC and Section 13(3) of the West Pakistan 
Family Court Act, 1964 empowers the Family Court to execute 
its own decree but for argument sake, even Section 64 of Code of 
Civil Procedure prohibits a private transfer or delivery of the 
attached property by the judgment-debtor after attachment has 
been made and all such transactions are void. In an almost 
identical matter, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case 
reported as Amjad Iqbal Vs Mst. Nida Sohail and others (2015 
SC 128) declared similar transaction as sham transaction to defeat 
purpose of decree and also held as under:- 

               C.R.No. 2823-2019 
6 
 
 
 
“………Both Hiba as well as the purported sale in favour 
of the petitioner were nothing but sham transactions and 
its purpose was to ensure that the decree is not satisfied. 
The decree was nothing but for the maintenance of 
respondent No.2’s own minor daughter. Unfortunately, the 
respondent No.2 in sheer disregard of his parental 
obligation has indulged in making all these unlawful 
transactions. What intent the respondent No. 2 had in his 
mind but to starve his own minor daughter of her basic 
needs for survival. The Court while exercising parental 
jurisdiction cannot just sit and be a spectator in this unholy 
and unlawful conduct of the respondent No.2……….” 
 
4. 
Even otherwise, there is no cavil to the proposition that 
disputed gifts will deprive all the daughters from inheritance and 
the courts are not divested of the powers to scrutinize the reasons 
and justification of such like gifts so that no injustice could be 
done. However, the learned appellate court while accepting the 
appeal failed to properly appreciate this legal proposition as well 
as the pleadings and oral/documentary evidence of contesting 
parties and fell in error while dismissing the suit, hence, the 
impugned judgment and decree of the learned appellate court 
dated 30.10.2018 is not sustainable in the eyes of law and the 
same is hereby set-aside by upholding the judgment and decree 
of the learned trial court dated 30.01.2016 and the suit of 
plaintiffs/petitioners is decreed.  Resultantly, this civil revision is 
accepted.
