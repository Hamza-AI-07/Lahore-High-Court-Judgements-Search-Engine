MUHAMMAD RAZA QURESHI, J.  This Regular First 
Appeal is directed against the Order and Decree dated 06.01.2021 
passed by learned Civil Judge 1st Class/Trial Court, Multan pursuant 
whereto suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell bearing 
No.842 dated 06.05.2016 was dismissed on account of failure of the 
appellants/plaintiffs to deposit the balance sale consideration in 
compliance of directions issued by the Court.   
2. 
 
Learned counsel for the Appellants submits that 
Impugned Order and Decree are illegal and unlawful as the learned 
Trial Court proceeded with undue haste to oust the appellants from 

R.F.A.No.93 of 2021.

the contest. According to learned counsel, the Appellants were 
already ready and willing to perform their part of agreement, but their 
liability 
was 
interconnected 
with 
the 
reciprocity 
of 
the 
respondents/defendants as the nature and scope of the agreement to 
sell was bilateral in its scope and effect. According to learned 
counsel, the learned Trial Court failed to appreciate that a substantial 
sum of money had been paid as earnest money and on the cut-off date 
stipulated in the subject matter agreement to sell the appellants 
expressed their readiness and willingness through payment of balance 
sale consideration, which the respondents refused to accept.  
3. 
 
Learned counsel has augmented that the judgment 
passed by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan as referred by the 
learned trial Court is inapplicable in the facts and circumstances of 
the case and Impugned Order and Decree are liable to be set aside. In 
support of his contentions, learned counsel has relied upon judgments 
reported as “Mrs. ZAKIA HUSSAIN and another versus Syed 
FAROOQ 
HUSAIN” 
(PLD 
2020 
Supreme 
Court 
401), 
“MUHAMMAD HUSSAIN and others versus Dr. ZAHOOR ALAM” 
(2010 SCMR 286), “Messrs PREMIUM DEVELOPERS through 
Chief Executive versus MUHAMMAD TARIQ” (2023 MLD 838), 
“MUHAMMAD JAMIL and others versus MUHAMMAD ARIF” 
(2021 SCMR 1108), “SAID MUHAMMAD versus ABDUR 
REHMAN” (1996 MLD 60) and “AGRA COOPERATIVE HOUSING 
SOCIETY LIMITED versus Syed AKHTAR ALI and others” (1994 
MLD 1747).

Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents submits 
that the primary test to be passed by the appellants was their 
readiness and willingness, which appellants throughout failed to 
satisfy. According to learned counsel, bare perusal of the agreement 
to sell reflects that its performance was only dependent upon the 
payment of balance sale consideration determined inter se parties to 
be paid on cut-off date. Learned counsel has assisted us by referring 
to the date of agreement to sell and date of institution of the suit to 
demonstrate that delay of 17 months itself speaks volumes about the 
conduct of the appellants. Adds that just by paying the meager 
earnest money the appellants cannot put the subject matter property 
under a clog. Contends that a suit for specific performance of 
agreement to sell is discretionary in its nature and scope wherein 
conduct of the parties plays a pivotal role and plaintiff(s) is/are 
expected to satisfy the test of law by substantiating his/their conduct 
through readiness and willingness to perform his/their part of 
agreement. In support of his contentions, learned counsel has relied 
upon “NAZAR HUSSAIN and another versus Syed IQBAL AHMAD 
QADRI (DECEASED) through his L.Rs and another” (2022 SCMR 
1216), “HAMOOD MEHMOOD versus Mst. SHABANA ISHAQUE 
and others” (2017 SCMR 2022), “FAROOQ IMRAN versus Group 
Captain (R.) NAEEM AHMAD SIDDIQUI” (2009 SCMR 157) and 
“ABDUS SALAM KHAN BARKI and another versus Mian PERVAIZ 
AKHTAR  and another” (PLD 2022 Islamabad 346).    
5. 
 
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and 
perused the record with their able assistance, which reflects that 

R.F.A.No.93 of 2021.

subject matter suit was instituted on 23.10.2018 wherein the 
appellants Malik Faisal Mahmood and Sohail Mahmood being 
vendees sought possession through specific performance of 
agreement to sell bearing No.842 dated 06.05.2016 (agreement to 
sell) against the respondents for the properties fully described/ 
enumerated in the plaint admeasuring 49-Kanals 05-Marlas 76-Feet 
situated in Mouza Bakher Arbi, Tehsil & District Multan.  
6. 
 
The vendees pleaded through plaint that total sale 
consideration for the subject matter land was in the sum of 
Rs.200,078,000/-, out of which the appellants paid an amount of 
Rs.8,000,000/- as earnest money, whereas the balance sale 
consideration amounting to Rs.192,078,000/- was to be paid till the 
cut-off date i.e. 31.05.2017. The contents of plaint reflect that the 
respondents being vendors had to perform their part of agreement 
through granting permission to the vendees to construct a wall but 
they failed to do so. According to plaint, the appellants throughout 
expressed their readiness and willingness. They got prepared a bank 
draft for the balance sale consideration and approached the vendors, 
but they refused to transfer the subject matter land in favour of the 
appellants and this refusal culminated into a cause of action in favour 
of the appellants to institute the subject matter suit.  
7. 
 
The learned Trial Court at the time of admission of suit 
granted injunctive relief to the Appellants through order dated 
23.10.2018 and directed them to affix court fee of Rs.15,000/-, which 
was furnished by them on 05.01.2019. The matter remained pending 
for issuance of notices to the respondents when through order dated 

R.F.A.No.93 of 2021. 
5
22.04.2019 learned Trial Court first time ordered the appellants to 
deposit the balance sale consideration. Thereafter, matter kept 
lingering on one pretext or the other and through order dated 
16.10.2020 learned Trial Court ordered the Appellants to deposit 
balance sale consideration within a period of two months with a 
caution that in case, the same was not deposited, the suit would be 
dismissed. The Appellants filed an application that the condition for 
deposit of balance sale consideration be replaced with surety bond. 
However, learned Trial Court pursuant to its order dated 06.01.2021 
not only dismissed the said application having no plausible ground, 
but also dismissed the suit by invoking the penal provisions of Order 
XVII Rule 3 CPC because the Appellants despite availing three fair 
opportunities failed to deposit balance sale consideration.  
8. 
 
Before discussing whether a delinquency could be 
attributed to the appellants or not as considered by the learned Trial 
Court, it is imperative to identify the nature and scope of subject 
matter agreement to sell for verification whether the same in its scope 
was even bilateral or not. Under the law, bilateral agreement is a 
document, by which parties create legal and enforceable obligations 
to be performed with mutual understanding involving each of them 
promise to implement an action in exchange for other party’s action 
and parties promise each other that they will perform or refrain from 
performing an act and if one of the parties perform its part of 
agreement, it is the other party who has to perform its part as agreed 
between them. Reliance in this regard is placed upon “IJAZ AHMAD 

R.F.A.No.93 of 2021. 
6
CHAUDHRY Versus Learned CIVIL JUDGE and others” (2020 CLC 
291).  
9. 
 
The perusal of agreement to sell reflects that vendors 
and vendees agreed to sell and purchase subject matter property for 
total sale consideration of Rs.200,078,000/-, out of which the 
vendees paid an earnest money in the sum of Rs.8,000,000/-, whereas 
the balance sale consideration in the sum of Rs.192,078,000/- was 
liable to be paid till 31.05.2017 and in case of failure of vendees the 
earnest money was liable to be confiscated. Whereas under the 
agreement, failure of the vendors entitled the vendees to institute a 
suit and get the sale deed executed through court of law. With respect 
to boundary wall which the appellants contended in their suit as part 
to be performed as a component of bilateral agreement by granting 
permission to construct a wall, the agreement reads as under:- 
 نکیل رفنیقی اول ےن الپٹ ذموکرہ رپ وبڈنری وال یک رفنیقی دومئ وک ااجزت
دی وہیئ ےہ
۔ 
 وج ہک
رفنیقی دومئ اےنپ رخےچ رپ ریمعت رکواںیئ ےگ ۔ ہی ہک وبتق ررٹسجی ےس لبق وبڈنری وال ےک ادنر

 روےپ
ےک اسحب ےس رفنیقی دومئ رفنیقی اول وک رمق ادا رکےن اک اپدنب وہاگ
۔    
 
[emphasis supplied]  
 
 
The plain reading of clause reflects that what appellants pleaded in 
their suit that agreement was bilateral in its nature as vendors had to 
grant permission to the vendees to construct a wall is belied by the 
terms and conditions of the agreement to sell, which clearly reflects 
that vendors had actually already granted a permission to the vendees 
to construct a wall and pay balance sale consideration till the cut-off 
date at agreed price of Rs.2,03,125/- per marla. Therefore, by any 

R.F.A.No.93 of 2021. 
7
stretch of legal imagination this agreement cannot be constituted as 
bilateral in its nature and scope. It appears such a plea was crafted 
just to devise a justification to avoid deposit of balance sale 
consideration. Therefore, we are clear that there is a fallacy in the 
plea of the Appellants that agreement to sell was bilateral in its effect 
and scope as it represent a misconceived and unsound argument.  
10. 
 
Since the comparison of contents of plaint and 
agreement to sell fails to rationalize the plea of bilateral agreement 
which on the face of it is belied by the contents, therefore, it 
forthwith becomes essential to identify whether the contention or 
pleadings of the appellants with respect to their readiness and 
willingness is substantiated through some reliable and creditworthy 
material. The appellants in Paragraph 3 of the plaint pleaded as 
under:-

To prima facie substantiate the contents of aforesaid 
paragraph, the Appellants claimed that they attached a copy of pay 
order with the suit which finds mentioned in the list of reliance 
submitted under Order XIII Rule 1 CPC. The perusal of pay order 
reflects that it is in the name of one of the vendors but much less than 
the balance sale consideration i.e. in the sum of Rs.44,000,000/-. 
There is no other document showing the payment of balance sale 
consideration. This Court through order dated 30.11.2022 had 
directed the appellants in the following terms:- 
“It reflects from perusal of record that appellants in 
paragraph 3 of the plaint of the suit alleged that they 
prepared a bank draft in the name of respondents and 
approached them on cut-off date, however, respondents 
did not perform their part of the agreement, but no such 
document is available on record. Appellants also 
mentioned in said paragraph regarding some litigation of 
respondents with third party, as another cause of non-
performance on the part of respondents, however, no 
documentary 
proof 
regarding 
such 
litigation, 
particularly its dates of institution and disposal are 
visible from record. Record shows that crucial date for 
final execution of agreement to sell was mentioned as 
31.05.2017, however, suit was instituted on 23.10.2018 
but no plausible cause is discernible from contents of 
plaint regarding filing of suit after a wait of 17-months 
from the date of alleged default on part of respondents.” 
 
12. 
 
In compliance of said direction, the appellants filed an 
application bearing C.M.No.3471 of 2022 annexing all the 
documents directed by us including cross cheque dated 31.10.2017 
amounting to Rs.600,000/- in the name of one of the vendors along 
with pay order mentioned above, which was already annexed with the 
suit. Additionally, the Appellants annexed statement of account of 
one of the Appellants, namely, Faisal Mahmood which from 1st July, 

R.F.A.No.93 of 2021. 
9
2017 to 7th June, 2018 does not reflect that in the whole tenure the 
appellants had even the amount of balance sale consideration in their 
account and sole entry of the highest amount in the statement of 
account is in the sum of Rs.35,526,017/- which is much less than the 
amount of balance sale consideration. All these factors magnify that 
the appellants could not justify their plea of readiness and willingness 
before the learned Trial Court and even before us despite grant of 
opportunity they failed to substantiate their plea. All these facts 
convince us to conceive why the learned Trial Court would have 
directed the appellants to demonstrate their bona fide by deposit of 
balance sale consideration.  
13. 
 
There appears to be a merit in the stance of the 
respondents that the appellants through suit were only covering up 
their default to make the balance sale consideration on the cut-off 
date and were actually aiming to misuse the process of law. 
Obviously by paying an abysmal 4.9% of total sale consideration the 
equity cannot be expected to equip the Appellants to put the subject 
matter property under a clog through motivated litigation as in a suit 
for specific performance of agreement to sell the plaintiff, under the 
mandate of equity is bound to demonstrate that he/she had performed 
his/her obligation under the agreement or that he/she was prevented 
to do so by the vendor.  
14. 
 
The onus at very initial stage from the institution of suit 
is on the vendee to satisfy the test of equity, firstly, that vendor 
actually refused to accept the sale consideration, secondly, the vendee 
who is seeking performance of agreement to sell having an ability 

R.F.A.No.93 of 2021. 
10
was ready and willing at all material times to perform his/her part of 
agreement. In such circumstances, it is essential and imperative that 
vendee is bound to deposit the balance sale consideration in the 
Court. The test of law is even on higher pedestrian i.e. the vendee 
cannot even seek enforcement of reciprocal obligation of the vendor 
unless he is able to demonstrate not only his/her willingness but also 
his/her capability to fulfill his/her obligation under the contract. 
Reliance in this regard is placed upon “MUHAMMAD YOUSAF 
versus ALLAH DITTA and others” (2021 SCMR 1241) and “Mst. 
NOOR JEHAN and another versus SALEEM SHAHADAT” (2022 
SCMR 918). In a recent case titled “Messrs DW PAKISTAN 
(PRIVATE) LIMITED LAHORE versus Begum ANISA FAZL-I-
MAHMOOD and others” (2023 SCMR 555) the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court has held as under:- 
“It is a well-settled exposition of law that the relief of 
specific performance of a contract is discretionary, 
however the said discretion cannot be exercised 
arbitrarily or unreasonably but can be invoked to 
promote fairness and equity. The person seeking specific 
performance has to put on show that he is geared up and 
fervent to perform his part of the contract, but the other 
side is circumventing or evading the execution of his 
obligations arising out of the contract. While deciding 
the suit for specific performance of a contract, the Court 
has to consider and come to a decision regarding 
whether the plaintiff is ready and willing to perform his 
part of the contract, which is in fact substantiated by dint 
of the conduct or demeanor of the plaintiff before and 
after instituting the lawsuit. The equitable remedy rests 
on the discretion which is obviously exercised according 
to the well-established standards and philosophy of law 
and not whimsically or capriciously. The fundamental 
insightfulness of the Courts in directing the plaintiff in a 
suit for specific performance to deposit the sale 
consideration in Court in fact articulates that the vendee 
has the capacity to pay the sale consideration or balance 
sale consideration and is ready and willing to perform 

R.F.A.No.93 of 2021. 
11
his obligations arising from the contract. An incessant 
readiness and willingness is a condition precedent for 
claiming relief of specific performance, which in unison 
also conveys the state of mind of the vendee, his 
capability to pay, keenness and commitment.” 
 
15. 
 
In a suit for specific performance of agreement to sell, it 
is always of paramount consideration that the plaintiff seeking 
equitable remedy of specific performance must be always willing and 
ready to perform his part of contract and conduct must satisfy the 
court that he is entitled to seek relief. These tests are to be satisfied 
through his ability and readiness and willingness. The wisdom behind 
directing the vendee to deposit the balance sale consideration is not 
aimed to verify the vendee’s seriousness but it also safeguards the 
rights of the vendor as such a direction is cautioned to strike a 
balance between two contracting parties. Reliance in this regard is 
placed upon “KHAIRAT ALI versus SAQIB ASHFAQ and others” 
(2023 CLC 926). The Supreme Court of Pakistan in judgment of DW 
Pakistan (Pvt.) Ltd. supra has held that readiness means the capacity 
of the Plaintiff to perform the contract, which would include the 
financial position to pay the purchase price. Willingness refers to the 
intention of the Plaintiff as a purchaser to perform his part of the 
contract. Willingness is inferred by scrutinizing the conduct of the 
Plaintiff/purchaser, including attending circumstances. Continuous 
readiness and willingness on the part of the Plaintiff/purchaser from 
the date the balance sale consideration was payable in terms of the 
agreement to sell, till the decision of the suit, is a condition precedent 
for grant of relief of specific performance. 

R.F.A.No.93 of 2021. 
12
16. 
 
It must be borne in mind that under Section 22 of the 
Specific Relief Act, 1877 the jurisdiction to issue a decree of specific 
performance is absolutely discretionary in its nature. Therefore, the 
Court in any event is not always bound to grant such relief merely 
because it is lawful to do so. Reliance in this regard is placed upon 
“Mrs. MUSSARAT SHAUKAT ALI v. Mrs. SAFIA KHATOON and 
others” (1994 SCMR 2189) and “SIRBALAND v. ALLAH LOKE and 
others” (1996 SCMR 575).  
17. 
 
In our analysis all these facts were analyzed by the 
learned Trial Court which convinced it to direct the Appellants to 
deposit the balance sale consideration. In legal understanding by 
filing an application to substitute the deposit of balance sale 
consideration with surety bond proved to be self-destructive as the 
appellants got themselves hit by their own stroke under the law as 
well as equity. In terms of law the delinquency of the appellants by 
(i) falsely deposing that at all material times they are ready and 
willing to perform their obligation under agreement to sell; (ii) by 
failing to prima facie establish their ability; (iii) by failing to attach 
proof of an instrument with respect to balance sale consideration the 
appellants disentitled themselves to a discretionary relief. The learned 
Trial Court was constrained to pass a direction for depositing the 
balance sale consideration and despite there being a caution for 
dismissal of suit on account of failure of the Appellants, learned Trial 
Court had no other option but to invoke the provisions of Order XVII 
Rule 3 CPC and pass the Impugned Order and Decree.    

R.F.A.No.93 of 2021. 
13
18. 
 
So far as contention of the appellants that learned Trial 
Court proceeded with undue haste and their reliance upon 
“MUHAMMAD ASIF AWAN versus DAWOOD KHAN and others” 
(2021 SCMR 1270) is concerned, suffice is to observe that both 
contentions are meritless. In Muhammad Asif Awan's Case (supra), 
the matter was fixed for evidence of the other side when Court 
invoked the provisions of Order XVII Rule 3 CPC and Hon’ble 
Supreme Court held that progress of the suit was not forestalled by 
failure of one of the parties through non-deposit of balance sale 
consideration. Additionally, the Hon’ble Supreme Court laid down a 
condition precedent for passing any such order that party must have 
been cautioned with a consequence leading to dismissal of the suit. In 
failure thereof, it was held that though application for interim relief 
could be declined but suit could not be dismissed.  
19. 
 
The facts of said case are not applicable in the instant 
case wherein learned Trial Court was simultaneously directing the 
respondents/defendants to file written statement and appellants to 
deposit balance sale consideration and had also specifically cautioned 
them that failure of a direction would lead to dismissal of suit. Even 
otherwise, in the instant case the application of appellants to 
substitute direction for deposit of balance sale consideration with 
surety bond proved to be lethal. The direction to the Appellants to 
deposit balance sale consideration was rather in consonance with the 
law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan as well as 
by this Court in judgments reported as “MUHAMMAD ASIF AWAN 
versus DAWOOD KHAN and others” (2021 SCMR 1270) and 

R.F.A.No.93 of 2021. 
14
“IRFAN RASHEED versus MUHAMMAD MUAZIM  and others” 
(PLD 2022 Lahore 372).   
20. 
 
Despite hectic efforts of learned counsel for the 
appellants we are not convinced that the Impugned Order and Decree 
suffer from any jurisdictional defect or procedural impropriety or is 
tainted with any illegality, therefore, the same do not warrant any 
interference. Consequently, this appeal is dismissed.
