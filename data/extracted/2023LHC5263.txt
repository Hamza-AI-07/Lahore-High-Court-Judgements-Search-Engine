J U D G M E N T 
 
Date of hearing:     12.10.2023. 
Applicant by: 
Mr. Muhammad Yahya Johar, Advocate. 
Respondent by: 
M/s. Waseem Ahmad Malik, Syed Nawazish 
Hussain and Zaki Vohra, Advocates.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant Reference Application under Section 133 of the Income Tax 
Ordinance, 2001 (“the Ordinance of 2001”), following question of 
law, urged to have arisen out of impugned order dated 05.02.2022, 
passed by learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, Lahore 
Bench, Lahore (“Appellate Tribunal”), has been pressed and 
argued for our opinion:- 
“Whether under the facts and circumstances of the case, the 
learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue has not erred in 
law to hold that Section 214-D of the Income Tax Ordinance, 
2001 has been repealed through Finance Act, 2018; 
therefore, after its repeal, the proceedings against the 
taxpayer for the tax year 2015 under Section 214-D of the 
Ordinance cannot be initiated, whereas such repeal cannot 
be applied retrospectively with respect to audit proceedings 
for tax year 2015?”  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondent-taxpayer e-filed 
income tax return for the tax year 2015, declaring income 
amounting to Rs.2,250,830/-, which was treated as an assessment 
order in terms of Section 120 of the Ordinance of 2001, however, 
owing to the late filing thereof, taxpayer’s case was selected for 
audit under Section 214-D of the Ordinance ibid. Later on, on 

 
 
ITR No.1255 of 2023

account of certain discrepancies found in the return and wealth 
statement, a show cause notice was issued to the respondent-
taxpayer, which culminated in passing of amended assessment 
order dated 30.11.2020 determining income at Rs.56,656,061/-, 
which included various additions and consequently tax demand was 
created at Rs.16,870,606/- which was upheld by CIR (Appeals) 
vide its order dated 16.03.2021. Being dissatisfied, respondent-
taxpayer preferred second appeal before the Appellate Tribunal, 
which was allowed vide order dated 05.02.2022 thereby annulling 
orders passed by both the authorities below. Hence, instant 
Reference Application.  
3. 
Learned Legal Advisor for applicant-department submits that 
the Appellate Tribunal has annulled the orders passed by A/DCIR 
as well as CIR (Appeals) as a result of undue haste and 
arbitrariness, thereby ignoring the principle of law enunciated by 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Commissioner of Income Tax, 
Peshawar v. Messrs Islamic Investment Bank Ltd. (2016 SCMR 
816) wherein it has been unequivocally held that it cannot be said 
that the income years which relate to the period covered under the 
repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, cannot be brought under 
scrutiny under its provisions after 30.06.2002 on the strength of 
Section 239(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. He adds that the 
Appellate Tribunal was not justified to hold that power to use 
Section 214-D of the Ordinance after its omission was not available 
to the DCIR by ignoring the provisions of Article 264 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (“the 
Constitution”) and Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. In 
the end, he submits that impugned order being absolutely illegal 
and without lawful authority, is liable to be set aside.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent-taxpayer defends 
the impugned order by contending that learned Legal Advisor for 
applicant-department has failed to point out any illegality or legal 
infirmity therein.

5. 
We have considered the rival arguments of both the parties 
and perused the relevant record available on file. 
6. 
Perusal of record reveals that the taxpayer defaulted in filing 
its return of income within time stipulated under the law, as the 
cutoff date for said purpose was 31.01.2016, whereas same was 
filed on 29.03.2016 and revised return was filed on 18.01.2017. The 
case of taxpayer was selected for audit under Section 214D of the 
Ordinance of 2001 and intimation to this effect was communicated 
to the taxpayer on 08.11.2018, however, it is a matter of record that 
the relevant provision of law in this regard i.e. Section 214D of the 
Ordinance of 2001 was omitted through Finance Act, 2018, passed 
by the National Assembly of Pakistan, which was to give effect to 
the financial proposals of the Federal Government for the year 
beginning on the first day of July, 2018. For facility of reference, 
Section 214D is reproduced hereunder:- 
“214D. Automatic selection for audit.- (1) A person shall 
be automatically selected for audit of its income tax affairs 
for a tax year, if --  
(a) the return is not filed within the date it is required to be 
filed as specified in section 118, or, as the case may be, 
not filed within the time extended by the Board under 
Section 214A or further extended for a period not 
exceeding thirty days by the Commissioner under 
Section 119; or 
(b) the tax payable under sub-section (1) of section 137 has 
not been paid. 
(2) Audit of income tax affairs of persons automatically 
selected under sub-section (1) shall be conducted as per 
procedure given in section 177 and all the provisions of this 
Ordinance shall apply accordingly: 
Provided that audit proceedings shall only be initiated 
after the expiry of ninety days from the date as mentioned in 
sub-section (1).  
(3) Subject to section 182, 205 and 214C, sub-section (1) 
shall not apply if the person files the return within ninety days 
from the date as mentioned in sub-section (1) and—  
(a) twenty-five percent higher tax, than the tax paid during 
immediately preceding tax year, has been paid by a 
person on the basis of taxable income and had declared 

 
 
ITR No.1255 of 2023 
 
4
taxable income in the return for immediately preceding 
tax year; or  
(b) tax at the rate of two percent of the turnover or the tax 
payable under Part I of the First Schedule, whichever is 
higher, has been paid by a person alongwith the return 
and in the immediately preceding tax year has either not 
filed a return or had declared income below taxable limit:  
Provided that where return has been filed for the 
immediately preceding tax year, turnover declared for the tax 
year is not less than the turnover declared for the 
immediately preceding tax year.  
(4) The provisions of sub-section (1) and sections 177 and 
214C shall not apply, for a tax year, to a person registered 
as retailer under rule (4) of the Sales Tax Special Procedure 
Rules, 2007 subject to the condition that name of the person 
registered under rule (4) of the Sales Tax Special Procedure 
Rules, 2007 remained on the sales tax active taxpayers‘ list 
throughout the tax year.  
(5) Sub-section (4) shall have effect from the date as the 
Board may, by notification in the official Gazette, appoint.” 
7. 
It is crystal clear from available record that learned Single 
Bench of this Court while dealing with similar proposition with 
regard to Section 214D of the Ordinance of 2001, vide order dated 
27.10.2020, passed in W.P. No.49412 of 2019 titled Hamid 
Mahmood v. Federation of Pakistan etc., authoritatively observed 
that aforesaid provision of law has been omitted by way of Finance 
Act, 2018, therefore, power is not available to be exercised by the 
officers subsequent to the omission. The Appellate Tribunal, while 
allowing taxpayer’s appeal, has also referred to the findings of 
Federal Tax Ombudsman vide judgment dated 26.12.2018, wherein 
the Commissioner Inland Revenue was directed to withdraw the 
audit proceedings regarding late filing of return for the tax year 
2015 under Section 214D ibid – review petition filed by FBR was 
also dismissed – FBR’s representation was also rejected by the 
President of Pakistan vide order dated 06.01.2020.  
8. 
Needless to say that section 214D, under which the subject 
notice was issued, was omitted by the Finance Act, 2018 (XXX of 
2018), which took effect on 22.05.2018 while the subject notice 

 
 
ITR No.1255 of 2023 
 
5
was issued on 08.11.2018 when the said provision was no more in 
field. In these circumstances it cannot be held that any right had 
accrued in favor of the department at the time of issuance of the 
notice. The situation might have been different if any such notice 
was issued prior to 22.05.2018. Moreover, the case of the 
respondent is also deemed to be concluded under the subsequently 
inserted section 214E which was made through the Finance 
Supplementary (Amendment) Act, 2018 (XXXVIII of 2018) which 
took into effect on 08.10.2018. The explanation to this section 
clearly provides that an audit initiated as a result of automatic 
selection under the omitted section 214D shall stand abated.  
 
Although, subsequently, after a lapse of about one and a half 
year, section 214E was further amended by insertion of sub-section 
2 in it through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2020 (XVII of 
2020) which took into effect on 27.03.2020 but this particular 
amendment cannot affect the case of the respondent because much 
prior to this amendment a substantial right already stood accrued 
in favor of the respondent at the time when the un-amended 
section 214E was in vogue.    
9. 
It is pertinent to mention here that when the legislature, while 
amending any statute, intends to preserve any inchoate right under a 
repealed provision, it usually incorporates a saving clause or 
provision in the amending statute which in not the case in hand. 
Although, it is also settled law that when any amendment is made in 
a statute which is procedural in nature then the retrospective rule of 
construction is to be applied even if it is not specifically given 
retrospective effect. However, there is an exception to this general 
rule i.e. when any substantial right stands accrued in favor of a 
person then this general rule will not be applied. In this regard the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan observed in Controller General of 
Accounts, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad and others v. 
Abdul Waheed and others (2023 SCMR 111) as follows: 

 
 
ITR No.1255 of 2023 
 
6
 “It is a well-settled principle of interpretation of statutes that 
where a statute affects a substantive right, it operates 
prospectively unless, by express enactment or necessary 
intendment, retrospective operation has been given. The insertion 
or deletion of any provision in the rules or the law, if merely 
procedural in nature would apply retrospectively but not if it 
affects substantial rights which already stood accrued at the time 
when the un-amended rule or provision was in vogue.” 
It was further observed by a Division Bench of Karachi High Court 
in Niaz Muhammad through Attorney v. Federation of Pakistan 
through Secretary, Ministry of Commerce, Islamabad and 2 
others (2008 PTD 1517) as follows: 
“Of and on it is expressed by apex Court that while interpreting 
statute and its retrospectively the material consideration is that 
whether the statute encroaches upon the vested rights of citizen or 
not. Statutes dealing with substantive law are prospective and those 
dealing with procedural law are retrospective, but in certain cases if 
procedural law affects the vested right it operates prospectively and 
not retrospectively.” 
The same view was upheld in by a Division Bench of Islamabad 
High Court in Commissioner Inland Revenue, Zone-II, 
Islamabad v. Messrs Wise Communication System, Islamabad 
(2019 PTD 2313). 
10. 
Needless to say that Article 10-A of the Constitution provides 
that every individual is entitled to a fair trial and due process and 
Article 4 of the Constitution lays down that every citizen is entitled 
to be treated in accordance with law, deviation whereof offends due 
process, logic and rationality and diminishes the legal character of a 
person under law.  
11. 
It is evident from the facts of the case that selection for audit 
was not automatic or forthwith triggered upon happening of an 
event of default, as envisaged by section 214A of the Ordinance of 
2001, but upon latest discovery of information, incidentally when 
relevant provision of law was not available on the statute book. 
Learned Legal Advisor for applicant-department has failed to point 
out any illegality or legal infirmity in the order passed by learned 
Appellate Tribunal, which even otherwise is well-founded, thus, 

 
 
ITR No.1255 of 2023 
 
7
needs no interference. The case law relied upon by learned Legal 
Advisor for applicant-department, being on distinguishable facts 
and circumstances, is not applicable to the present scenario. 
12. 
In view of the above, our answer to the purposed question is 
in affirmative i.e. against applicant-department and in favour of 
respondent-taxpayer. 
 
This  Reference Application is decided against applicant-
department.  
13. 
Office shall send a copy of this judgment under seal of the 
Court to learned Appellate Tribunal as per Section 133 (5) of the 
Ordinance of 2001.
