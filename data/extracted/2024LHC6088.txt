ASIM HAFEEZ, J. Petitioners through this and connected 
constitutional petitions (detailed in the annexed Schedule-A) claim 
entitlement and seek enforcement of right to be considered for the 
purposes of appointment under Rule 17-A of the Punjab Civil 

W.P. No.62298 of 2024 
2 
 
Servants (Appointment & Conditions of Service) Rules, 1974, (the 
‘Rules, 1974’) notwithstanding the omission of Rule 17-A of the 
Rules 1974 vide Notification dated 24.07.2024. It is alleged that right 
to be considered for appointment accrued before the Notification of 
omission of Rule 17-A, ibid, was issued. 
2. 
This Court had earlier interpreted the scope of the Notification 
dated 24.07.2024 textually, observing that since the Government had 
not extended retrospective effect to the omission of the Rule, 17-A of 
the Rules, 1974, therefore same would apply prospectively, and rights 
accrued, to be considered for appointment, be given due effect. 
Decisions in cases of “Syed Noor-ul-Hadi Shah Vs. Government of 
Punjab, etc.” (W.P. No. 13444/2024) and “Muhammad Zaman Vs. 
Government of Punjab, etc.” (W.P. No. 12771/2024) are the 
references to the context. In latter decision the ratio and effect of the 
decision by Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in “General Post 
Office, Islamabad & others Vs. Muhammad Jalal” (Civil Petition No. 
3390/2021) was considered - [Referred Civil Petition was heard on 
26.09.2024, converted into appeal and allowed vide order dated 
18.10.2024]. 
3. 
Learned Law Officer submits that in terms of the decision by 
the Apex Court Rule 17-A of the Rules 1974 was declared 
unconstitutional and ultra vires; being violative of the constitutional 
principles of equality of citizens and lacking in transparency. Adds 
that declaration of invalidity would take effect from the date of 
introduction / insertion of Rule 17-A, ibid, but same would not affect 
the appointments already made, since the appointments were 

W.P. No.62298 of 2024

protected. Learned Law Officer placed reliance on following cases, 
reported as Pir Bakhsh & others vs. Chairman Allotment Committee & others 
(PLD 1987 SC 145), Malik Asad Ali & others Vs. Federation of Pakistan & 
others (PLD 1998 SC 161), Ali Azhar Khan Baloch & others vs. Province of 
Sindh & others (2015 SCMR 456), Mir Muhammad Khan & others Vs. Haider & 
others (PLD 2020 SC 233) and Shahid Pervaiz vs. Ejaz Ahmad & others (2017 
SCMR 206). Learned law officer further argues that decisions, in the 
context of Rule 17-A, already handed down by this Court and 
mentioned supra are distinguishable, wherein simplicitor issue of 
retrospectivity of the omission of Rule 17-A was decided without 
dilating upon the scope and effect of the protection extended to the 
appointments already made, in the case of General Post Office, 
Islamabad & others (supra). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the petitioners contend that 
declaration qua Rule 17-A of the Rules 1974 was not made in the case 
of General Police Office, Islamabad & others (supra), therefore same 
does not extend to include Rule 17-A, ibid, which was already omitted 
before the decision. 
5. 
Heard. It is appropriate to reproduce relevant part of the 
decision in the case of General Post Office, Islamabad & others 
(supra) to facilitate understanding the context and breadth of the 
arguments by learned law officer, which relevant paragraph reads as,  
25. Any law, policy or rule which is manifestly inconsistent with the 
Constitutional 
commands, 
retrogressive 
in 
nature 
and 
discriminatory inter se the citizens is subject to judicial review. In 
the case of Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Secretary 
Agriculture v. Tahir Mushtaq and others, while dismissing the claim 
of the son of a retired civil servant of the Agriculture Department of 
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa who sought appointment in BPS-5 on the 

W.P. No.62298 of 2024 
4 
 
basis of employee's son quota policy, it was held by a four member 
Bench of this Court that: 
"The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 
prohibits discrimination as stated in Article 25 and further 
stipulates and entrenches the principle in respect of service 
of Pakistan in Article 27. In preferring the children of a 
government servant or reserving seats for them offends the 
Constitution. The same also detracts from a merit based 
system of employment. The taxpayers hard earned monies 
pay for the salaries, benefits and pensions of government 
servants. The people's interest lies in having the best person 
for the job, and not to suffer those who secure employment 
on the basis of a filial relationship. The stated instructions 
undermine transparency and good governance, therefore, 
the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will be advised to 
withdraw all such instructions/notifications.'  
For the above reasons, while granting leave, Civil Petition No. 
3390 of 2021 is converted into an appeal and is allowed. The 
impugned order dated 13 April 2021 passed by the Peshawar High 
Court in favour of the respondent is set aside. Policies, office 
memorandums, employment under the Package of the Prime 
Minister, the Financial Assistance Package, Rule 11-A of the 
Sindh Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) 
Rules, 1974, Rule 10 (4) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Civil 
servants (Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) Rules, 1989, 
Rule 12 of the Balochistan Civil Servants (Appointment, 
Promotion and Transfer) Rules, 2009 or any other rule, policy, 
memorandum, etc. whereunder appointments without open 
advertisement, competition and merit, of the widow/widower, 
wife/husband or child of civil servants in different grades, who die 
during 
service 
or 
become 
permanently 
disabled/invalidated/incapacitated for further service and take 
retirement from service, are declared to be discriminatory and 
ultra vires Articles 3, 4, 5(2), 18, 25(1) and 27 of the Constitution. 
The prescribed Federal and Provincial authorities are directed to 
withdraw the same. However, it is clarified that the instant 
judgment shall not affect the appointments already made of the 
widow/widower, wife/husband or child of deceased or retired civil 
servants. It is further clarified that this judgment shall not affect 
the policies, rules or compensation packages of the Federal and 
Provincial Governments for the benefit of the legal heirs of 
martyred personnel of the law enforcement agencies and of civil 
servants who die on account of terrorist activities.”

6. 
In the case of General Post Office, Islamabad & others (supra), 
Hon’ble three-member Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, 
converted Civil Petition into appeal and allowed it by setting-aside the 
impugned order dated 13 April 2021, of the Peshawar High Court and 
recorded declaration, context and extent thereof is relevant for the 
purposes of deciding the matters at hand – text of the declaration 
recorded in the case of General Post Office, Islamabad & others 
(supra) is highlighted by providing emphasis.  
  
Rule 17-A of the Rules 1974 did not exist when decision in the 
case of General Post Office, Islamabad & others (supra) was passed, 
and Rule 17-A, ibid, was omitted by Government of Punjab through 
Notification dated 24.07.2024. Submissions by learned Advocate 
General Punjab in the case of General Post Office, Islamabad & 
others (supra) are relevant and reproduced hereunder,   
14. 
Learned Advocate-General, Punjab informed that the 
policy for appointing one child/wife/widow in BPS-1 to BPS-11 
(including the post of Patwari and Junior Clerk) of a civil 
servant 
who 
dies 
in 
service 
or 
is 
declared 
invalidated/incapacitated for further service in pursuance of the 
provisos to the above rule 17-A was discontinued with effect 
from 21 November 2023 vide notification dated 7 December 
2023. Thereafter, vide notification dated 26 July 2024 rule 17-A 
was omitted. He further stated that the Government of Punjab 
has approved a Financial Assistance Package with effect from 
22 February 2017 for the families of the civil servants who die 
while in service, with different rates of compensation for 
different pay scales and the rate of compensation has been 
revised from time to time. The Financial Assistance Package in 
the Province of Punjab does not contain any provision to provide 
a Government job, either on contract or regular basis, in any 
grade, to a child/wife/widow of a civil servant who dies in 
service or is declared invalidated/incapacitated for further 
service.”

7. 
Whether, in the facts and circumstances,  declarations made in 
the case of General Post Office, Islamabad & others (supra) could be 
read to extend to or cover Rule 17-A of the Rules 1974 when said rule 
ceased to exist and acknowledged as a non-existent rule. Learned law 
officer insisted that declaration issued may also be stretched to cover 
Rule 17-A, ibid, without appreciating the scope of the decision in the 
case of General Post Office, Islamabad & others (supra) and manifest 
jurisprudential consistency with respect to the principle that Courts 
refrain from making decisions / declarations having bare academic 
value. Since Rule 17-A of the Rules, 1974 had been withdrawn / 
omitted before the Judgment therefore reference thereto was 
conspicuous by its absence in the decision cited. I am afraid that 
nothing could be added or read into the judgment in the context of the 
mandate of Article 189 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973. It is pertinent to mention that in the case of “General 
Post Office, Islamabad & others (supra), Hon’ble Supreme Court had 
excluded Rule 12-A of the Baluchistan Civil Servants (Appointment, 
Promotion and Transfer) Rules 2009 (Rules 2009), which provided for 
appointment(s) without open advertisement, from the ambit of the 
declaration. Learned Advocate General Baluchistan informed Hon’ble 
Supreme Court that Rule 12-A of the Rules 2009 was omitted vide 
notification of 9 May 2003 –[rule 12 of the Rules 2009 existed till 
decision was handed down in the case of General Post Office, 
Islamabad & others (supra). Now, upon reading the declaration made 
in the case of General Post Office, Islamabad & others (supra) no 
reference is found regarding Rule 12-A of the Rules, 2009, which is 
indicative of the fact that Rule(s) omitted were not part of the 

W.P. No.62298 of 2024 
7 
 
declaration – and same analogy is drawn with reference to Rule 17-A 
of the Rules 1974. Judgments referred by the law officer have had 
elucidated the principle of retrospectively or otherwise, but they are 
silent with respect to legal issue that had gripped controversy, i.e., 
applicability and effect of the declaration with respect to the law / 
policy / rule, that did not exist at the time of the declaration. There is 
no cavil that in certain cases / instances declarations were sought and 
granted with respect to alleged vested rights claimed to have had 
accrued before the omission / repeal of the law, but then such 
declarations exhibit specificity. 
8. 
In view of the aforesaid, I find no reason to revisit the decisions 
rendered in cases of “Syed Noor-ul-Hadi Shah” and “Muhammad 
Zaman” (supra), wherein the scope, effect and extent of Notification 
of 24.07.2024  was interpreted already and no aberration(s) are found 
in the context of declaration(s) made in the case of General Post 
Office, Islamabad & others (supra). There is no information that 
Government of Punjab had sought review of the judgment in the case 
of General Post Office, Islamabad & others (supra), seeking 
incorporation of Rule 17-A of the Rules, 1974 as part of the 
declaration. Consequently, objection to the maintainability of these 
petitions stands dismissed and no retrospective effect could be 
extended to the omission of Rule 17-A by offending the settled 
jurisprudence.   
9. 
These petitions are disposed of by observing that department(s) 
/ authorities / officers concerned shall examine the rights of the 
petitioners, to be considered for purposes of appointment, subject to 

W.P. No.62298 of 2024 
8 
 
the limitations provided under Rule 17-A of the Rules, 1974, provided 
that the right to consider, in each case, had arisen and obviously 
intimated / claimed by the petitioner(s) within reasonable time of the 
accrual of the cause – triggering event.
