Through 
this 
constitutional petition, the petitioner has challenged the show 
cause notice dated 31.05.2023, issued under Section 257 of the 
Companies Act, 2017 (Act) by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission of Pakistan (Commission) and order dated 
17.11.2023 for the appointment of Inspectors to investigate the 
affairs of the petitioner-company. 
2. 
The relevant facts are that the petitioner-company was 
issued show cause notice dated 31.05.2023 (impugned show 
cause notice) to the effect that a complaint was received by the 
Commission and as per information as available on the website 
of the Company, prima-facie, Company is engaged in illegal 
deposit taking/investment activities in the guise of SMD

(Visual LED Screens) marketing. It was also recorded in the 
impugned show cause notice that the investors/prospective 
investors/general public are committed fixed monthly returns in 
exchange for their funds which are used to finance purchase 
and installation of SMDs which are claimed to be generating 
return for the Company through marketing and advertising 
thereon by third parties. It is also stated in the impugned show 
cause notice that said state of affairs prima-facie suggests that 
Company is engaged in illegal activities in violation of section 
84 of the Act, which requires investigation into the affairs of 
the Company, hence, impugned show cause notice was issued 
to the petitioner-Company that why action should not be 
initiated under Section 257 of the Act. The petitioner being 
aggrieved filed Writ Petition No.44455/2023, which was 
disposed of being not pressed vide order dated 27.06.2023, 
however, the petitioner-Company was allowed to raise its legal 
objection before the Commission, which was to be decided at 
the first instance. Consequently, through impugned order dated 
17.11.2023 (impugned order), the Commission has decided 
the impugned show cause notice on legal as well as factual 
grounds and appointed a team of Officers of Commission as 
Inspectors, to investigate into the affairs of the Company, 
hence, this petition.

The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that 
impugned show cause notice was issued under Section 257 of 
the Act on a complaint of an individual who is neither 
shareholder nor member of the Company. He submits that 
under Section 256 read with Section 257 of the Act, the 
investigation can only be initiated on a complaint by 
Shareholder or member of the Company or order of the Court. 
He further submits that there is no independent or suo-moto 
power available with the Commission to appoint Inspectors 
under Section 257 of the Act. He place reliance on “TARIQ 
IQBAL MALIK Vs. Messrs MULTIPLIERZ GROUP PVT. LTD. 
and 4 others” (2022 CLD 468) to argue that provisions of 
Sections 256 & 257 of the Act being intertwined, complaint 
must be on behalf of shareholder or member of the Company. 
He further submits that when the Commission formed its 
opinion under Section 257(1)(b) of the Act, it is also required to 
confront the material on the basis of which the said opinion was 
formed. He placed reliance on “Competition Commission of 
Pakistan and others Vs. Dalda Foods Limited, Karachi” (2023 
SCMR 1991).  
4. 
 
The learned counsel for the respondents, on the 
other hand, submits that not only complaint of various investors 
was received by the Commission but the impugned show cause 
notice was also issued on the basis of information available on 

-4- 
Writ Petition No.77742/2023. 
 
 
 
the website of the petitioner-Company, which prima-facie, 
shows that the petitioner-Company is engaged in illegal deposit 
taking/investment activities in the guise of SMD marketing. 
Submits that under section 257(1)(b) of the Act, the 
Commission can appoint Inspectors after show cause notice and 
further the material on the basis of which the opinion was 
formed was duly confronted to the petitioner in the impugned 
show cause notice.  
5. 
 
Arguments heard. Record perused. Admittedly the 
petitioner was issued impugned show cause notice and for 
convenience para No.1 thereof is reproduced hereunder:- 
“WHEREAS, a complaint was received by the 
Commission, and information as available on 
the website of the Future Vision Advertising 
(Pvt.) Limited (the Company), the Commission 
had observed that the Company prima facie is 
engaged in illegal deposit taking/investment 
activities in  the guise of SMD (Visual LED 
Screens) marketing. The investors/prospective 
investors/general public are committed fixed 
monthly returns in exchange for their funds 
which are used to finance purchase and 
installation of SMDs which are claimed to be 
generating return for the Company through 
marketing and advertising thereon by third 
parties”.  
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
From the above show cause notice, it is evident that the 
Commission issued show cause notice not merely on the basis 
of a complaint but also on the basis of information, available on 
website of the petitioner-Company and after considering the 

-5- 
Writ Petition No.77742/2023. 
 
 
 
said record, the Commission, prima-facie, observed that the 
petitioner-Company is engaged in illegal deposit taking/ 
investment activities in the guise of SMD marketing. The legal 
question requires determination in this case is that whether on 
the basis of a complaint and record available on the website, the 
Commission could issue show cause notice and initiate 
proceedings under Section 257 of the Act through impugned 
order.  
6. 
 
To answer this legal question, it is expedient to 
reproduce Sections 256 & 257 of the Act as under:- 
256. Investigation into affairs of Company. (1) 
Where the Commission is of the opinion, that it is 
necessary to investigate into the affairs of a 
Company_  
(a)   on the application of the members holding not 
less than one tenth of the total voting power in 
a Company having share capital; 
(b)   on the application of not less than one tenth of 
the total members of a company not having 
share capital; 
(c)   on the receipt of a report under Sub-Section 
(5) of Section 221 or on the report by the 
Registrar under sub-section (6)  of Section 
254;  
it may order an investigation into the affairs of the 
Company and appoint one or more persons as 
inspectors to investigate into the affairs of the 
company and to report thereon in such manner as the 
Commission may direct.  
 
Provided that before making an order of 
investigation, the Commission shall give the 
Company an opportunity of being heard.  
 
(2) 
While appointing an Inspector under 
sub-section (1), the Commission may define the 
scope of the investigation, the period to which it is to 
extend or any other matter connected or incidental to 
the investigation.  

-6- 
Writ Petition No.77742/2023. 
 
 
 
(3) 
An application by members of a 
company under clause (a) or (b) of sub-section (1) 
shall be supported by such evidence as the 
Commission may require for the purpose of showing 
that the applicants have good reason for requiring 
the investigation.  
(4)  
The Commission may, before appointing 
an inspector, require the applicants to give such 
security for payment of the costs of the investigation 
as the Commission may specify.  
 
257. Investigation of company’s affairs in other 
cases. (1) Without prejudice to its power under 
section 256, the Commission___ 
(a) 
shall appoint one or more competent 
persons as inspectors to investigate the 
affairs of a company and to report 
thereon 
in 
such 
manner 
as 
the 
Commission may direct, if___  
(i) 
the 
company, 
by 
a 
special 
resolution, or  
(ii) 
the Court, by order,  
declares that the affairs of the company ought to be 
investigated; and  
(b) 
may appoint one or more competent 
persons as inspectors to investigate the 
affairs of a company and to report 
thereon 
in 
such 
manner 
as 
the 
Commission may direct if in its opinion 
there are circumstances suggesting___ 
 
(i) 
that the business of the company 
is being or has been conducted 
with 
intent 
to 
defraud 
its 
creditors, members or any other 
person or for a fraudulent or 
unlawful purpose, or in a manner 
oppressive of any of its members 
or that the company was formed 
for any fraudulent or unlawful 
purpose; or 
(ii) 
that persons concerned in the 
formation of the company or the 
management of its affairs have in 
connection therewith been guilty 
of fraud, misfeasance, breach of 
trust or other misconduct towards 
the company or towards any of its 

-7- 
Writ Petition No.77742/2023. 
 
 
 
members or have been carrying 
on unauthorized business; or 
(iii) 
that the affairs of the company 
have been so conducted or 
managed as to deprive the 
members thereof of a reasonable 
return; or  
(iv) 
that the members of the company 
have not been given all the 
information with respect to its 
affairs 
which 
they 
might 
reasonably expect; or 
(v) 
that any share of the company 
have been allotted for inadequate 
consideration; or 
(vi) 
that the affairs or the company 
are 
not 
being 
managed 
in 
accordance with sound business 
principles or prudent commercial 
practices; or  
(vii) that the financial position of the 
company is such as to endanger 
its solvency: 
 
Provided that, before making an 
order under clause (b), the Commission 
shall give the company an opportunity 
of being heard.  
(2) 
While appointing an inspector under sub-
section (1), the Commission may define the scope of 
the investigation whether as respects the matters or 
the period to which it is to extend or otherwise.  
 
7. 
 
Plain reading of Section 256 and 257 of the Act 
shows that under aforesaid provisions the investigation into the 
affairs of the Company can be ordered by the Commission in 
five different situations. Firstly under Section 256(1)(a) & (b) 
of the Act, on the application of the members holding not less 
than one tenth of the total voting power in a Company having 
share capital or on the application of members not less than one 
tenth of the total members of a Company not having share 

-8- 
Writ Petition No.77742/2023. 
 
 
 
capital, where the Commission is of the opinion, that it is 
necessary to investigate into the affairs of a Company, it may 
order to investigate and appoint one or more persons as 
Inspectors to investigate and report thereon in such manner as 
the Commission may direct. Secondly, under Section 256(1)(c) 
of the Act, on the receipt of a report under Section 221(5) of the 
Act by the authorized Officer while inspecting books of 
accounts and books of papers of the Company or under Section 
254(6) of the Act by the Registrar while exercising his power to 
call for information. However, the word “may” indicates that 
the aforesaid appointments of Inspectors under Section 256(1) 
of the Act are discretionary with the Commission and subject to 
its opinion that investigation is necessary. The provision of 
Section 257 of the Act relates to investigation of Company’s 
affairs in other cases and the said provision is without prejudice 
to the power of the Commission under Section 256 of the Act. 
The third and fourth situation is where under Section 
257(1)(a)(i) of the Act, the Company by special resolution or 
under Section 257(1)(a)(ii) of the Act, the Court by order 
declares that the affairs of the Company ought to be 
investigated, the Commission shall appoint one or more 
competent persons as Inspectors to investigate the affairs of the 
Company and to report thereon in such manner as the 
Commission may direct. The word “shall” used for Section 

-9- 
Writ Petition No.77742/2023. 
 
 
 
257(1)(a)(i) & (ii) of the Act means that here the Commission 
has no discretion to form an opinion, rather it is bound to 
appoint the Inspectors if there is a special resolution by the 
Company or order of the Court. However, it may prescribe the 
manner in which the affairs of the Company will be 
investigated. Fifth situation is under Section 257(1)(b) of the 
Act, where again by use of word “may”, the discretion made 
available with the Commission to appoint one or more persons 
as Inspectors to investigate the affairs of the Company and to 
report thereon if in the opinion of the Commission, there are 
circumstances suggesting that, the business of the Company is 
being or has been conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, 
members or any other person for a fraudulent or unlawful 
purpose, or in a manner oppressive of any of its members or 
that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful 
purpose from the persons who found the Company or its 
management guilty of fraud, misfeasance, breach of trust or 
other misconduct towards the company or towards any of its 
members from carrying on unauthorized business or the affairs 
of the company have been conducted to deprive the members of 
reasonable return or members are not given information or 
shares of the company have been allotted for inadequate 
consideration or the Company’s affairs are not managed in 
sound business principles or prudent commercial practices or 

-10- 
Writ Petition No.77742/2023. 
 
 
 
the financial position of the company is such as to endanger its 
solvency.  
8. 
 
From the above, it is manifest that besides upon 
application or report under section 256(1) of the Act, there is 
independent power available with the Commission under 
Section 257(1)(b) of the Act to form its opinion on the basis of 
circumstances suggesting therein for appointment of Inspectors. 
However, before making any order under Section 257(1)(b) or 
256(1) of the Act, the Commission is required to give Company 
an opportunity of being heard but no such opportunity of 
statutory show cause is required, while appointing Inspectors 
under Section 257(1)(b) of the Act on the declaration of Court 
order or by special resolution of a Company.  
9. 
 
The circumstances of present case when examined 
in the context of above legal position, it is noted that impugned 
show cause notice is not only referring to a complaint but also 
based upon information available on the website of the 
petitioner-Company to the effect that company is engaged in 
illegal deposit taking/investment activities in the guise of SMD 
marketing. No doubt, under Section 256(1)(a) & (b) of the Act, 
the complaint can only be filed by the members holding not less 
than one tenth of the total voting power or total membership, as 
also correctly held by this Court in case of “Tariq Iqbal Malik” 
supra, however, under Section 257(1)(b) of the Act, the 

-11- 
Writ Petition No.77742/2023. 
 
 
 
Commission has independent powers to appoint Inspectors after 
show cause notice if in its opinion there are circumstances 
suggesting various situations mentioned in Sub-clause (i) to 
(vii) of Section Para 257(1)(b) of the Act ibid. In this case, the 
allegations against the petitioner-Company that it is engaged in 
illegal deposit taking/investment activities in the guise of SMD 
marketing from general public, squarely falls under the scope of 
section 257(1)(b) of the Act, therefore, it cannot be said that 
opinion was not correctly formed by the Commission or show 
cause notice or impugned order passed by the Commission are 
without jurisdiction or not backed by law. Further, impugned 
show cause notice is not only requirement of rule of natural 
justice but same is also the statutory requirement under proviso 
(ii) of Section 257 of the Act, therefore, it cannot be said that 
same is without jurisdiction.  
10. 
 
The next argument of the learned counsel for the 
petitioner that the Commission has no independent power to 
appoint Inspectors but it can only make appointments on the 
application of the members, receipt of report under Section 
221(5) and 254(6) of the Act or on Court order or Company 
special resolution, is also misconceived. The provision of 
Section 257(1) of the Act commences with the expression 
“without prejudice to its power under Section 256, the 
Commission”. It is well settled law that when such expression 

-12- 
Writ Petition No.77742/2023. 
 
 
 
is used, it means that anything contain in the provision 
following this expression is not intended to cut down generality 
of the meaning of the preceding provision. (Refer “P 
Ramanatha Aiyar’s Advance Law Lexicon, Volume 4”). This 
means that power of the Commission under Section 257 of the 
Act will not curtail the power of Commission under Section 
256 of the Act for the appointment of Inspectors. This legal 
position is further supported by the fact (as already discussed 
above) that section 256 of the Act deals with the situations 
where Inspectors are appointed on the application of the 
members or report of the authorized Officer or Registrar under 
Section 221(5) or Section 254 of the Act, whereas under section 
257 of the Act, investigation of Company’s affairs is in other 
cases i.e. on special resolution by Company or the Court order 
or independent power of the Commission when in its opinion 
the circumstances suggests appointment of Inspectors.  
11. 
 
It is pertinent to note that both in Section 256(1) 
and Section 257(1)(b) of the Act, the Commission is to form an 
opinion before appointment of Inspectors. However, the said 
opinion under Section 257(1)(b) of the Act must be based upon 
circumstances suggesting various situations mentioned in 
Clauses (i) to (vii) of Section 257(1)(b) of the Act, whereas the 
formation of opinion under Section 256(1) of the Act is not 
confined only to circumstances suggested in Clauses (i) to (vii) 

-13- 
Writ Petition No.77742/2023. 
 
 
 
of Section 257(1)(b) of the Act ibid but Commission has much 
wide powers to appoint Inspectors if it is necessary to 
investigate into the affairs of the Company. By using the words 
“without prejudice to its power under Section 256, the 
Commission”, in Section 257(1) of the Act, the legislation has 
intentionally not restricted the formation of opinion of 
Commission under Section 256(1) of the Act only to the 
circumstances of Clauses (i) to (iv) of Section 257(1)(b) of the 
Act. Further the use of “;” (Semicolon) before the word “and”, 
in between Sub-Section (1)(a) and sub-Section(1)(b) of Section 
257 of the Act, prove that sub-section (1)(a) and (1)(b) of 
Section 257 of the Act are two independent clauses that are not 
joined by conjunction. As per “Words and Phrases” Volume 
38B” “semicolon” is used to separate consecutive phrases or 
clauses independent of each other grammatically but dependent 
alike on some word preceding or following. From the above, it 
is manifest that Section 257(1)(b) of the Act is a separate clause 
under which a Commission has independent power to appoint 
the Inspectors to investigate the affairs of the Company if in its 
opinion there are circumstances suggesting the situation 
mentioned in Sub-Section (i) to (vii) of Section 257(1)(b) of the 
Act.  
`12.  
 The case of “Competition Commission of 
Pakistan and others Vs. Dalda Foods Limited, Karachi” relied 

-14- 
Writ Petition No.77742/2023. 
 
 
 
upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner relates to the 
inquiry conducted by the Competition Commission of Pakistan 
(CCP) under section 37 of the Competition Commission Act, 
2010 and not appointment of Inspectors under Sections 256 & 
257 of the Act by the Commission. Even in said judgment, the 
Supreme Court maintained the power of CCP to initiate inquiry 
being a regulator, however, required that the due process of law 
should be followed and the discretion to form an opinion must 
be exercised justly, fairly and further the gist of reasons and 
facts, that prevailed with CCP for initiating inquiry be 
conveyed to the undertaking/Company. In the present case, the 
perusal of impugned show cause notice and order, shows that 
the basis to form an opinion to initiate inquiry by Commission 
are not only duly conveyed to the petitioner but, prima-facie, 
the said reasons are also cogent, whereby according to 
information available on website, the petitioner is apparently 
engaged in illegal deposit taking/investment activities in the 
guise of SMD marketing. The Supreme Court in “Brothers 
Steel Ltd. and others Vs. Mian Mirajuddin and 15 others” 
(PLD 1995 Supreme Court 320), while examining the similar 
power of the Company Bench of this Court under Section 265 
in the Companies Ordinance, 1984 (Since repealed), held that 
full-fledged inquiry in the form of a trial is not required before 
passing the order or for the appointment of Inspectors and 

-15- 
Writ Petition No.77742/2023. 
 
 
 
Court has to only satisfy itself, prima-facie on the basis of 
material placed before it that a case for investigation through 
Inspectors is called for and it is for the Inspectors to ascertain 
and determine the truth or otherwise of the allegations during 
the investigation to be conducted by them. The relevant part of 
the judgment is reproduced hereunder:-  
“We are of the considered view that in proceedings 
under Section 265 of the Ordinance, full-fledged 
inquiry in the form of a trial, is not required to be 
held nor any formal evidence is to be recorded. 
Needless to observe that before passing the order 
under Section 265 of the Ordinance, the Court has 
to only satisfy itself, prima-facie, of course, on the 
basis of the material placed before it, that a case for 
investigation through an Inspector is called for and 
it is for the Inspector to ascertain and determine the 
truth or otherwise of the investigations during the 
investigation to be conducted by him whereafter, he 
will submit the report to the concerned Authority”.  
 
In the aforesaid case, the Supreme Court upheld the judgment 
of this Court in “Mian Miraj Din and others Vs. Brothers Steel 
Mills and others” (1996 CLC 516), where same views were 
recorded.   
13. 
 
In view of above discussion, this petition being 
meritless is dismissed.
