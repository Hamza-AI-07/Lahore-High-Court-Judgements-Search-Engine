      Anwaar Hussain, J.  The petitioners were the plaintiffs before 
the Trial Court. Suit for declaration was filed in respect of the disputed 
property, detail whereof is given in the headnote of the plaint, against the 
respondents, on the basis of registered sale deed dated 28.12.1968 with 
the averments that one Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon purchased the 
suit property. Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon had two wives, namely, 
Mst. Zainab Bibi and Mst. Rehmat Bibi. Mst. Zainab Bibi was mother of 
the petitioners, whereas Mst. Rehmat Mai was mother of one Muhammad 
Nawaz who was predecessor-in-interest of the respondents No.1 to 11 
(“the respondents”) as also predecessor of proforma respondents. Per 
plaint of the suit, Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon died on 23.09.1991

C.R. No.346/2018 
 
 
and the step brother of the petitioners, namely, Muhammad Nawaz 
(deceased),  predecessor-in-interest of the respondents No.1 to 11, who 
was already in control of the suit property, kept on lingering the matter of 
inheritance, on one pretext or the other, and finally died whereafter the 
respondents in collusion with the Revenue Staff got registered sale deed 
bearing Document No.307 (erroneously referred as 1471 in the plaint) 
dated 29.03.2003, hence, the suit was instituted seeking declaration that 
the suit property belonged to late Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon and 
that the respondents as well as the petitioners are entitled to the same as 
legal heirs of the said deceased. Prayer was also made for cancellation of 
the sale deed dated 29.03.2003.  
2.  
Contesting written statement was filed by the respondents with 
the averments that it was deceased Muhammad Nawaz who purchased the 
suit property from one Muhammad Jamal son of Sohanra, through a 
written agreement to sell dated 02.11.1967, which fact has been duly 
incorporated in the record of Excise and Taxation department and after 
the death of Muhammad Nawaz, respondent No.1 (widow) along with 
respondents No. 2 to 5 (daughters) have alienated their share in the suit 
property to respondents No.6 to 11 (sons), therefore, the claim of the 
petitioners that the suit property belonged to Ghulam Muhammad alias 
Gamoon is false. Issues were framed and after recording evidence of the 
parties pro and contra, the suit of the petitioners was dismissed by the 
Trial Court, vide judgment and decree dated 28.05.2016, which was 
upheld by the Additional District Judge, Layyah, vide judgment and 
decree dated 29.01.2018.  
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioners submit that the findings of 
the Courts below are based on misapplication of law as also result of 
misreading and non-reading of the record and are liable to be set-aside. 
Adds that the sale deed in favour of Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon 
dated 28.12.1968 is a registered document and the same has been ignored 
by the Courts below and an unregistered document dated 02.11.1967 

3 
C.R. No.346/2018 
 
 
relating to the sale of the suit property, in favour of the deceased 
Muhammad Nawaz, who was step elder brother of the petitioners has 
been preferred, which is not sustainable in the eyes of law. Adds that in 
the presence of a registered document, an unregistered document, even if 
earlier has no value and the same does not create any title and therefore, 
the Courts below were not justified to dismiss the suit filed by the 
petitioners.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents support the 
impugned findings with the averments that the value of the property was 
below Rs.100/- and hence, in terms of Section 54 of the Transfer of 
Property Act, 1882 (“the Act 1882”) read with Section 17 of the 
Registration Act, 1908 (“the Act 1908”), the same was not required to be 
compulsorily registered and therefore, the prior instrument is to be 
preferred over the subsequent document. Add that the petitioners averred 
incorrect facts in their plaint inasmuch as if Muhammad Nawaz died prior 
to Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon, its illogical on part of the 
petitioners to assert that they were claiming their share of inheritance in 
the property from former after the demise of Ghulam Muhammad alias 
Gamoon. Further avers that the entire case of the petitioners was based on 
hearsay and therefore, the Courts below correctly dismissed the suit of the 
petitioners. 
5.  
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
6.  
The following questions of law require opinion of this Court: 
i. Whether the Courts below were justified in giving 
preference to prior unregistered document over a 
subsequent registered document pertaining to the 
same immovable property? 
ii. Whether the incorrect assertion of facts in the plaint 
and disconnect of the pleadings and evidence of the 
plaintiff can be made basis of the findings even if the 
documentary evidence available on record depicts 
otherwise?  

4 
C.R. No.346/2018 
 
 
7.  
The core issue involves the preference to be attached between 
the prior unregistered and a later registered document regarding the same 
property. Admittedly, the suit property was earlier owned by Jamal 
Sohanra who statedly executed the prior agreement to sell in favour of 
Muhammad Nawaz. Learned counsel for the respondents argued that as 
the value of suit property was less than Rs. 100/, therefore, the 
unregistered agreement to sell was not required to be registered. The 
argument is based on the jaundiced and lopsided view and consideration 
of the law in this regard, which overlooks Section 50 of the Act 1908. 
Sub-section (1) of Section 50 of the Act 1908 lays down general principle 
that a registered document, even if falling under Section 18, regarding the 
immovable property shall take effect as regards the property therein 
against every unregistered document relating to the same property 
irrespective of the nature of the unregistered document. Section 50 of the 
Act 1908 reads as under:  
“50. Certain registered documents relating to land 
to take effect against unregistered documents.– (1) 
Every document of the kinds mentioned in clauses (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) of Section 17, sub-section (1), [and 
every document registrable under Section 18, in so far 
as such document effects immovable property or 
acknowledges the receipt or payment of any 
consideration in respect of any transaction relating to 
immovable property], shall, if duly registered, take 
effect as regards the property comprised therein against 
every unregistered document relating to the same 
property, and not being a decree or order, whether such 
unregistered document be of the same nature as the 
registered document or not: 
Provided that the person in possession of the property 
under an unregistered document prior in date, would 
be entitled to the rights under Section 53-A of the 
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 if the conditions of 
that Section are fulfilled: 
….” 
(Emphasis supplied) 

5 
C.R. No.346/2018 
 
 
First proviso to Section 50(1) creates an exception by providing that 
where the person is in possession of the property under an unregistered 
document, prior in time, he would be entitled to the protection under 
Section 53-A of the Act 1882 provided further if the conditions of Section 
53-A are fulfilled, which for ease of reference is reproduced hereunder: 
“53-A.      Part performance. – Where any person 
contracts to transfer for consideration any immovable 
property by writing signed by him or on his behalf 
from which the terms necessary to constitute the 
transfer can be ascertained with reasonable certainty,  
 
and the transferee, has, in part performance of the 
contract, taken possession of the property or any part 
thereof, or the transferee, being already in possession, 
continues in possession in part performance of the 
contract and has done some act in furtherance of the 
contract,  
and the transferee has, performed or is willing to 
perform his part of the contract,  
then, notwithstanding that the contract, though 
required to be registered, has not been registered, or, 
where there is an instrument of transfer, that the 
transfer has not been completed in the manner 
prescribed therefor by the law for the time being in 
force, the transferor or any person claiming under him 
shall be debarred from enforcing against the transferee 
and persons claiming under him any right in respect of 
the property of which the transferee has taken or 
continued in possession, other than a right expressly 
provided by the terms of the contract: 
 Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the 
rights of a transferee for consideration who has no 
notice of the contract or of the part performance 
thereof.” 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis supplied) 
Perusal of Section 53-A of the Act 1882, particularly the proviso thereof, 
provides that nothing in the said Section shall affect rights of the bona 
fide purchaser for consideration who has no notice of the prior written 
contract or the part performance thereof.

C.R. No.346/2018 
 
 
8.  
Having above legal position in respect of the registered 
document and unregistered document in sight, it has been noted that 
admittedly, Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon in whose favour the 
registered sale deed was executed was the real father of Muhammad 
Nawaz (as also predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners) in whose favour 
the unregistered sale deed was executed. As a natural human conduct, no 
father would enter into any contract and/or execute a registered document 
in the nature of the sale deed for immovable property if he had any notice 
of a prior contract or part performance of the contract for the same 
property executed by the same vendor in favour of his own son (deceased 
Muhammad Nawaz in the present case), who was admittedly residing 
with the deceased father and had control of the suit property as well. 
Suffice to observe that it has never been the case of the respondents that 
deceased Muhammad Nawaz and Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon-the 
said father and son were having such acrimonious relation to the extent of 
both purchasing the same property from the same vendor, to their mutual 
detriment and without notice of the father that the suit property had 
already been purchased by his son through unregistered document and the 
possession thereof had been transferred. Thus, either the unregistered sale 
deed did not exist at the time when the Ghulam Muhammad alias 
Gamoon-father of deceased Muhammad Nawaz and the petitioners 
purchased the property or Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon had no 
notice of the agreement to sell between the Muhammad Nawaz and the 
vendor or part performance thereof. The earlier situation casts no 
aspersion on the validity and genuineness of the registered sale deed in 
favour of deceased Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon; in case of later, 
the respondents cannot claim the protection of Section 53-A and by 
extension that of proviso to Section 50 of the Act 1908. Thus, the 
contention of learned counsel for the respondents is devoid of any 
persuasion that the prior written agreement to sell is to be preferred over 
the subsequent registered document. Even otherwise, the burden of proof 

7 
C.R. No.346/2018 
 
 
as to the knowledge of unregistered document by the father of the 
petitioners was on the respondents’ side which they failed to discharge. 
Therefore, in peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of 
the view that an unregistered document even if prior in time cannot be 
given preference to registered document more particularly when the latter 
document is holding the field and no challenge has been laid to the same 
by the respondents.     
9.  
Adverting to the second question formulated hereinabove, the 
respondent side made full-throttle arguments that pleading of the 
petitioners and the evidence is replete with self-defeating contradictions 
as the petitioners/plaintiffs took contradictory stance in the pleadings as 
also in oral evidence and the Courts below have rightly relied upon the 
incorrect facts in pleadings as also the statement of petitioner No.1 to 
draw the conclusion that if Muhammad Nawaz (predecessor-in-interest of 
the respondents) died prior to the death of Ghulam Muhammad alias 
Gamoon, how the petitioners were asking Muhammad Nawaz to effect 
the inheritance in their favour in accordance with the registered 
document. It is also relevant to note that in para 3 of the plaint, the 
petitioners asserted as under:  
’’

While appearing as PW.1, petitioner No.1 deposed as under:  
’’

Moreover, when cross-examined, petitioner No.1 (PW.1) stated as under:  
’’

8 
C.R. No.346/2018 
 
 
Operative part of the impugned judgment of the Trial Court reads as 
under:  
“10.…To 
support 
their 
version 
they 
produced 
Muhammad Ramzan S/o Ghulam Muhammad as PW-1, 
by supporting his own version he stated that his father 
purchased shop situated at Chobara Road consisting of  
3-M 2-S. He further stated that his brother Muhammad 
Nawaz died before two months of his father death. He 
stated that he demanded his share of inheritance from 
Muhammad Nawaz after their father death who advised 
him to be patient. However, this statement was self 
contradictory...” 
Evidentiary resume as also the plaint of the suit of the petitioners clearly 
depict that even though registered document was in favour of 
predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners as also deceased Muhammad 
Nawaz, the petitioners’ side rendered their case porous and pervious by 
making incorrect averments in the plaint. Though there is no satisfactory 
answer available with the petitioners in respect of the above contradictory 
stance, learned counsel for the petitioners assert that the same is result of 
slackness and the same cannot be made basis for allowing impugned 
findings to hold the field, which are perverse and against the law.  
10. 
This Court is of the view that the Courts below missed the forest 
for the trees. The contradictions in the pleadings and the evidence 
reproduced above in the ordinary course might have been highly 
detrimental to the case of the petitioners, however, it is settled proposition 
of law that civil cases are to be decided on preponderance of evidence by 
reading the evidence as a whole rather cherry-picking certain aspects of 
the pleadings and/or evidence. This helps in achieving a predictable 
standard pattern in reaching a just decision. The vital issue in the matter 
was the preference to be attached to the registered or unregistered 
document, which certainly does not involve as to the prior death of 
Muhammad Nawaz even though Muhammad Nawaz pre-deceased his 
 

9 
C.R. No.346/2018 
 
 
 
father-Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon and the petitioners wrongly 
averred in the pleadings that after the death of Ghulam Muhammad alias  
Gamoon, they asked Muhammad Nawaz to transfer the suit property to 
them to the extent of their share but he did not do so on one pretext or the 
other whereas Muhammad Nawaz had pre-deceased his father. It is worth 
mentioning that though Muhammad Nawaz pre-deceased his father 
Ghulam Muhammad alia Gamoon and there is a contradiction in the 
pleadings of the petitioners which has been made basis of dismissal of the 
suit of the petitioner, the said aspect also brings forth the malice and fraud 
committed by the respondents that has been completely ignored by the 
Courts below. It is well settled that the inheritance of a person opens upon 
his death. Therefore, even if it is acknowledged that deceased Muhammad 
Nawaz was the owner of the suit property, the death of Muhammad 
Nawaz opened up his inheritance and Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon, 
the father of Muhmmad Nawaz (as also the predecessor of the 
petitioners), who was alive at the relevant time, was undoubtedly also 
legal heir of Muhammad Nawaz. A question arises as to how and why the 
respondents gobbled up the inheritance share of Ghulam Muhammad 
alias Gamoon. There is no explanation available on record in this regard 
and Courts below have also ignored this aspect. In fact, this goes on to 
reflect the desperation, which induced the respondents to deprive the 
petitioners with their inheritance share in the suit property.  
11. 
It is also to be kept in sight that, admittedly, the suit property has 
been recorded in the name of deceased Muhammad Nawaz by the Excise 
and Taxation Office concerned on the strength of an unregistered 
document and after death of Muhammad Nawaz, respondents No.1 to 5 
(widow and daughters) have alienated their purported share in the suit 
property to respondents No.6 to 11 (sons) through impugned registered 
sale deed dated 29.03.2003 on the strength of the said entry in Excise and 

10 
C.R. No.346/2018 
 
 
Taxation Office concerned. The contents of the impugned registered sale 
deed are interesting, which read as under:

Before observing anything about the above referred document and/or the 
contents thereof and its effect on outcome of this case, this Court would 
like to state a settled proposition of law as to the tentacles of the 
revisional power of this Court. The question as to the scope and extent of 
revisional powers of a High Court fell for consideration before the 
Supreme Court in case reported as “Manager Jammu & Kashmir State 
Property in Pakistan vs Khuda Yar and another” (PLD 1975 SC 678) 
wherein the Supreme Court at Page-697 observed the simultaneous 
stiffness as well as agility of revisional powers in the following manners: 
“…The scope of the revisional powers of the High 
Court though circumscribed by conditions of excess of 
jurisdiction, failure to exercise jurisdiction, illegal 
exercise of jurisdiction, is nevertheless very vast and 
corresponds to a remedy of certiorari and in fact goes 
beyond that at least in two respects inasmuch as: 
Firstly, its discretionary jurisdiction may be invoked 
by the Court suo motu, and Secondly, the Court “may 
make such order in the case as it thinks fit.”  
(Emphasis supplied) 
 
Thus, it is obvious that while the revisional powers may be circumscribed 
and cordoned off by conditions of excess of jurisdiction, failure to 

11 
C.R. No.346/2018 
 
 
exercise jurisdiction, illegal exercise of jurisdiction, it is very vast being 
in the nature of certiorari and rather travels beyond the same. While 
relying upon Manager Jammu 7 Kashmir State property (case) supra, this 
Court in case bearing C.R. No.852-D/2003 titled “Noor Muhammad 
Versus Niaz Ahmad etc.” (available at Lahore High Court website at 2021 
LHC 8093) held that High Court in exercise of its revisional and 
visitorial jurisdiction can undertake the exercise of analysis of the 
evidence for the first time regarding a piece of evidence not analysed 
and/or overlooked by the Courts below. With this legal position at the 
forefront, this Court, though not argued in this manner, inquired about the 
contents of the impugned sale deed dated 29.03.2003 executed by the 
respondents and recitals whereof have been reproduced hereinabove, 
which describes and refers the suit property being ancestral (جدی/Jaddi). 
The term “جدی ملکیت” used in the admitted document (the impugned sale 
deed) in favour of respondents No.6 to 11 hardly needs any judicial 
elaboration. It means the paternal or ancestral. If the respondents 
themselves admit that the suit property was not self-acquired asset of the 
deceased Muhammad Nawaz rather was in the ownership of Muhammad 
Nawaz as an ancestral property (جدی ملکیت), their claim of ownership on 
the basis of unregistered document falls, more particularly, when the 
registered sale deed in favour of Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon 
pertaining to the same property is intact and not cancelled. This crucial 
aspect of the case squarely brings the matter within the purview of the 
cardinal principle of evaluation of evidence that ‘a man may lie but the 
documents do not’. The Courts below clearly singled out incorrect 
assertion of a fact and discrepancies in evidence of the petitioners at the 
cost of the central issue regarding the preference to be attached to the 
registered document over an unregistered document and ignoring the 
contents of the impugned sale deed dated 29.03.2003, which this Court is 
obligated to correct in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction in terms of 
Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. 

12 
C.R. No.346/2018 
 
 
12. 
Moreover, mere fact that the respondents are in possession of the 
suit property and their names exist in Excise and Taxation record and the 
utility bills for the connections installed thereat are in the name of 
deceased Muhammad Nawaz has no relevance when admittedly, the 
deceased Muhammad Nawaz was real eldest son of Ghulam Muhammad 
alias Gamoon, born from his first marriage and was residing with 
deceased Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon. It appears that deceased 
Muhammad Nawaz was put in possession of the suit property as a 
licensee by his father (Ghulam Muhammad alias Gamoon) and had the 
complete control thereof as asserted by the petitioners and corroborated 
by the attending circumstances of the case. Therefore, the petitioners who 
are children born from the second wedlock of deceased Ghulam 
Muhammad alias Gamoon were justified in relying on the hearsay 
evidence to substantiate their inheritance claim based on a registered 
deed.  
13. 
At this juncture, it is imperative to observe that neither the 
pleadings can be treated as evidence nor documentary evidence can be 
brushed aside on account of the weak oral testimony of the plaintiffs, 
more particularly, when the case is that of inheritance and based on a 
registered document, which is more than 58 years old and holding the 
field. Therefore, the disconnect in the pleadings of the petitioners as also 
the oral evidence is not convincing for this Court to non-suit them when 
clearly, registered document in favour of the predecessor-in-interest of the 
petitioners is available on record as also the document in favour of the 
respondents, 
i.e., 
impugned 
sale 
deed 
dated 
29.03.2003 
that 
acknowledges the fact that the suit property was ancestral and was not 
self-acquired property of predecessor of the respondents-deceased 
Muhammad Nawaz, under prior unregistered document.  
14. 
In view of the preceding discussion, this Court is of the view that 
both the Courts below have erred in appreciating the legal question 

13 
C.R. No.346/2018 
 
 
involved and also could not appreciate the material documentary evidence 
on record. Therefore, this petition is allowed; the concurrent findings of 
the Courts below are set aside;  and the suit of the petitioners is decreed.
