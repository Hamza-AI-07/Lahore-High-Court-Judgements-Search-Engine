26.02.2024 M/s Muhammad Ali Siddiqui and Fatima Safeer, Advocates 
for appellant. 
Mr. Arshad Pervaiz Qureshi, A.A.G. 
Mr. Asfhan Akram Kang, Law Officer on behalf of PESSI – 
respondents No. 1 to 7.  
 
Instant intra-court appeal is directed against 
decision dated 11.12.2023, whereby learned Judge-in -
Chambers dismissed appellant’s constitutional petition 
inter alia on the premise that factual controversy could 
not be decided and further observed that decision of 
offering retainership assignment to respondent No.8 was 
a transitory arrangement.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the appellant fundamentally 
objected against the capricious exercise of discretion by 
the Central Selection Committee, which proceeded to 
allow respondent No.8 to work under retainership 
arrangement, 
conspicuously 
overlooking 
prior 
recommendation of the appellant, by the Interviewing 
Committee, for the same task. It is argued that procedure 
adopted for offering retainership arrangement was 
obscure, exclusive and promotes nepotism. 
3. 
On last date of hearing, learned counsel for 
respondent 
No.8 
appeared, 
who 
submitted 
that 

                                      I.C.A. No.03 of 2024 
2 
 
retainership assignment was for one year, which had 
already expired. Adds that respondent No.8 could not 
otherwise perform fully due to pending litigation. 
4. 
The instant case highlights important aspects 
pertaining to how the retainership agreement by the 
Central Selection Committee, PESSI is awarded across 
the Province in various social security hospitals. This is 
the context of this appeal. Upon hearing, we consider that 
nothing could be declared illegal or reversed, when 
illegality outlived itself. No academic exercise intended.  
5. 
However, it has been noted that there are no 
standards or criteria carved out by the Central Selection 
Committee in this regard on the strength of which the 
recommendation by the Interviewing Committee can be 
set aside. Therefore, we tend to make certain 
observations to enable the management/Governing Body 
to 
take 
remedial 
measures 
to 
ensure 
fairness, 
transparency and regimenting of discretion. Lack of 
standards/criteria to offer the retainership agreement have 
perpetuated the unstructured exercise of discretion which 
cannot be countenanced under the jurisprudence 
developed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan regarding 
exercise of discretion by the public functionaries. Case 
reported as “Walayat Ali Mir v. Pakistan International 
Airlines Corporation through its Chairman and another” 
(1995 SCMR 650) is referred in this regard. Similarly, in 

                                      I.C.A. No.03 of 2024 
3 
 
case reported as “Mushtaq Ahmad Mohal and others v. 
The Honourable Lahore High Court, Lahore and others” 
(1997 SCMR 1043), it has been held by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan that in matters which involve 
public participation pertaining to pursuit of profession 
through permanent jobs or otherwise, the matter should 
be advertised properly inasmuch as Article 27 read with 
Articles 18, 25 and 2A of the Constitution of Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, mandates that every citizen 
shall have the right to enter upon any lawful profession 
or occupation and to conduct any lawful trade or 
business.  
6. 
It has been conceded before us that no applications 
were invited for awarding the retainership contract but 
walk-in-interviews were conducted. Meaning thereby 
that besides lack of standards/criteria pertaining to 
exercise of discretion by the Central Selection 
Committee, process is also bereft of transparency and 
fair-play as the retainership contract can be dished out to 
the aspirants of liking on the basis of mere walk-in-
interview without any formal advertisement in a 
newspaper inviting applications thereof, so that larger 
pool of the candidates can come to know about the 
creation/existence of vacancy of retainership contract in a 
social security hospital functioning under the auspices of 
PESSI as the same carries an opportunity for any citizen 

                                      I.C.A. No.03 of 2024

interested to apply for the same and if qualified, gives an 
opportunity to earn bread and butter, which is 
fundamental right of every citizen. The lack of 
standards/criteria depicting transparency allowed lateral 
entry to respondent No.8. Delay caused in considering 
recommendations of the appellant speaks of conspicuous 
omission. We refrain from attributing insinuations. When 
asked that what measures have been adopted to check 
unstructured 
discretion by 
the 
Central 
Selection 
Committee, 
learned 
counsel, 
representing 
PESSI, 
explained that assigning retainership arrangement to 
respondent No.8 was a stop-gap arrangement, who 
conceded that no applications were invited but walk-in-
interviews conducted. He explained that pursuant to the 
recent policy decision by the Governing Body, 
recruitment of two posts of Physiotherapist, on contract 
basis for a period of three years, in social security 
hospital, is sought through the Punjab Public Service 
Commission. We hope that this policy decision is not 
simply a point-scoring strategy to deal with instant 
litigation, 
but 
such 
practice 
must 
be 
followed 
consistently, throughout the Province, in social security 
hospitals for the relevant posts. There is no cavil that in 
extraordinary 
situations 
transitory 
and 
adhoc 
appointments are required but it should be a rarity not a  
 

                                      I.C.A. No.03 of 2024

routine practice. We are sanguine that the Central 
Selection Commission shall endeavour to espouse 
fairness, impartiality and transparency while discharging 
the duties and obligations entrusted. We direct Office of 
this Court to send the copy of this order to the Governing 
Body of the PESSI as well as Secretary, Labour and 
Human Resource Department, Government of Punjab, 
who is head of the administrative department concerned.
