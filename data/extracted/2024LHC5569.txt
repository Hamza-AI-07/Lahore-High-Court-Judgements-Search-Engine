SULTAN KHAN and another  
Versus 
MUHAMMAD NAWAZ (deceased) Through his Legal Heirs and others  
 
JUDGMENT 
Date of hearing:

Petitioners by: 
Mr. 
Muhammad 
Amir 
Butt, 
Advocate. 
Respondents by: 
Ex-parte. 
 
 
MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This petition under Section 115 
of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) stems from the judgment 
and decree dated 15th May, 2012 handed down by learned Additional 
District Judge, Chakwal, whereby he while allowing the appeal 
preferred 
by 
Muhammad 
Nawaz, 
predecessor-in-interest 
of 
respondents No.1A to 1D (hereinafter referred to as “deceased 
respondent”) set aside the judgment and decree dated 2nd December, 
2010 passed by the learned Civil Judge Class-I, Chakwal by virtue of 
which suit for possession instituted by deceased respondent was 
dismissed. 
2. 
Facts forming background of this petition are that deceased 
respondent instituted a suit for possession in respect of land 
measuring 8 Marla bearing Khasra No.746 Khatooni No.526 Khewat 
No.168 situated in village Hastal Tehsil and District Chakwal, 
averring therein that he is owner in possession of the suit land but 

Civil Revision No.689-D of 2012

about one and an half year ago the petitioners and respondents No.2 
to 5 forcibly took over the possession whereafter he moved an 
application to the revenue officer for conducting of demarcation 
proceedings, wherein it was found that the petitioners and 
respondents No.2 to 5 encroached upon his property. It was claimed 
in the suit that though deceased respondent requested them to hand 
over the possession of the suit land but they refused. Suit was 
resisted by the petitioners by asserting that their predecessor-in-
interest namely Ghulam Qadir purchased land measuring 2 Kanal 10 
Marla forming part of Khasra No.745 from Feroz Din through 
registered sale deed in the year 1977 but the possession was handed 
over from Khasra Nos.746 as well as 745. Suit was resisted on 
various grounds including limitation. From the divergent pleadings 
of the parties multiple issues were framed by the learned Civil Judge 
and on culmination of trial, suit was dismissed by way of judgment 
and decree dated 2nd December, 2010. Feeling dissatisfied an appeal 
was preferred by the deceased respondent before the learned 
Additional District Judge, Chakwal. During the pendency of appeal, 
the deceased respondent passed away and respondents No.1A to 
respondents No.1D were impleaded as his legal representatives. The 
appeal was ultimately allowed through judgment and decree dated 
15th May, 2012 and resultantly suit was decreed to the effect that 
respondents No.1A to 1D are entitled to get the vacant possession of 
5 Marla of land from the petitioners and 3 Marla of land from 
respondents No.2 to 5 from Khasra No.746, hence this petition under 
Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908). 
3. 
This petition was admitted for regular hearing by way of order 
dated 18th September, 2012 and notice was issued to the respondents 
but they failed to appear and were proceeded against ex-parte as a 
result of which it was directed to be placed for ex-parte hearing. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that suit 
instituted by the deceased respondent was not maintainable and as 
such it was rightly dismissed by the trial court initially. It is 
contended that the appellate court without adverting to the material 

Civil Revision No.689-D of 2012 
 
-3- 
 
pieces of evidence drawn a contra view, which renders the impugned 
judgment nullity in the eyes of law. Learned counsel emphatically 
argued that suit was clearly barred by time but the question of 
limitation has not been attended properly by the appellate court, 
which by itself is sufficient to set at naught the impugned judgment. 
It is argued by learned counsel that without seeking declaration of 
title suit for possession was not maintainable. Placed reliance on 
MUHAMMAD IQBAL versus MATI UR REHMAN and others (2022 SCMR 
859), WAZIR KHAN and others versus QUTAB DIN and others (PLD 2009 
Supreme Court 95) and SULTAN MAHMOOD SHAH through L.Rs. and 
others versus MUHAMMAD DIN and 2 others (2005 SCMR 1872). 
5. 
I have heard learned counsel for the petitioners at considerable 
length and also perused the record. 
6. 
Suit was in terms of Section 8 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 
wherein it is claimed by the deceased respondent that he is owner 
in possession of the suit land and the petitioners have dispossessed 
him forcibly about one and half year ago qua which he also got 
demarcated the suit land wherein it is found that the petitioners have 
encroached upon the same. Contrary to this, it is the stance of the 
petitioners that their predecessor-in-interest namely Ghulam Qadir 
purchased the property measuring 2 Kanal 10 Marla from Feroz-ud-
Din son of Fazal Din through registered sale deed in the year 1977 
whereafter they raised construction in the shape of residential 
houses. It is also asserted that at the time of purchase though it was 
mentioned that the property forms part of Khasra No.745 but at site 
possession was delivered from Khasra Nos.745 & 746 as the vendor 
(deceased respondent) was owner in both the Khasra numbers.  
7. 
From the respective pleadings of the parties it is manifestly 
clear that the parties are not in dispute to the effect that deceased 
respondent purchased the property forming part of Khasra No.746 
and he is a lawful owner of the same. It is also not in dispute that the 
predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners have purchased the property 
from Khasra No.745 but as per their stance after the execution of 
sale deed the possession was handed over to the vendee from Khasra 

Civil Revision No.689-D of 2012 
 
-4- 
 
No.745 as well as Khasra No.746 as the vendor was owner in both 
the Khasras. The petitioners are thus not throwing any serious 
challenge to the title of the deceased respondent. In this backdrop 
objection of learned counsel for the petitioners with regard to 
maintainability of suit for possession is without any due force. 
Needless to observe that a person is only obliged to seek declaration 
when somebody is interested to deny his legal right or character as 
ordained in Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, which is not 
the case here. 
8. 
Suit is mainly resisted by the petitioners on account of 
limitation regarding which issue No.1 was framed. It evinces from 
the record that suit was initially dismissed and issue of limitation 
was also decided against the deceased respondent. In appeal, 
learned Additional District Judge while dealing with the question of 
limitation held the suit within time on the ground that the deceased 
respondent purchased land from the legal heirs of Feroz Din in the 
year 2001 and possession was also delivered to him in pursuance to 
which mutation was also sanctioned as is evident from Exhibit-P5 
but the encroachment of the petitioners came to his notice and 
knowledge in the year 2002, after the demarcation proceedings, 
whereafter he instituted the suit which is well within time. Above all 
it is noticed that petitioners admittedly do not possess any title 
regarding property situated in Khasra No.746. In other words, the 
petitioners are occupying the property owned by deceased 
respondent unauthorizedly. Needless to observe that the petitioners’ 
act of occupying the suit property illegally and unlawfully would 
amount to give recurring cause to the deceased respondent. 
9. 
As already mentioned hereinabove that it is the stance of the 
petitioners that their predecessor-in-interest namely Ghulam Qadir 
purchased the property through registered sale deed in the year 1997 
from Khasra No.745 but as the vendor was also owner in Khasra 
No.746, so possession was handed over to the vendee in both the 
Khasras and since then they are peacefully enjoying it. Needless to 
mention that when once it is established that the petitioners are not 

Civil Revision No.689-D of 2012 
 
-5- 
 
the owners of the suit property which is forming part of Khasra 
No.746, so they can only be termed as trespassers or in adverse 
possession. The term “adverse possession” is defined in various law 
dictionaries as under :- 
Black's Law Dictionary Tenth Edition 
adverse possession. (18c) 1. The enjoyment of real property 
with a claim of right when that enjoyment is opposed to 
another person's claim and is continuous, exclusive, hostile, 
open, and notorious. • In Louisiana, it is the detention or 
enjoyment of a corporeal thing with the intent to hold it as 
one's own. La. Civ. Code art. 3421. – Also termed adverse 
dominion. Cf. PRESCRIPTION (5).  
 
Webster's New World Law Dictionary 
adverse possession n. A method of acquiring title to real estate 
by actually, continuously, and openly occupying the property 
for an uninterrupted amount of time to the exclusion of all 
others and in defiance of the real owner's rights. The required 
period of occupancy, as well as other possible conditions, are 
set by statute.  
 
KJ Aiyar Judicial Dictionary 16th Edition 
Adverse possession. Possession of (usually of land) which is 
inconsistent with the right of a person who claims to be the true 
owner. Trespass does not constitute adverse possession. There 
must be real possession accompanied by intent to possess. It 
must be 'adverse' to the owner and must not be permissive. 
  
Whereas “trespass” is defined as under :- 
Black's Law Dictionary Tenth Edition 
trespass (tres-pes or tres-pas), n. (13c) 1. An unlawful act 
committed against the person or property of another; esp., 
wrongful entry on another's real property. Cf. unlawful entry 
under ENTRY (1). 2. At common law, a lawsuit for injuries 
resulting from an unlawful act of this kind. • The lawsuit was 
instituted by a writ of trespass. 3. Archaic. MISDEMEANOR. — 
trespass, vb. — trespassory (tres-pe-sor-ee), adj.  
 
Webster's New World Law Dictionary 
trespass 1 n. An illegal act committed against another's person 
or property; especially entering upon another's land without the 
owner's permission. 2 n. In common law, a legal suit for 
injuries resulting from an instance of the first definition. 3 v. 
To enter upon property without permission, either actual or 
constructive. 
trespass on the case. A common-law precursor to today's 
negligence, nuisance, and business torts, it was a suit to remedy 
injury to person or property not resulting directly from the 
defendant's conduct but a later consequence of same.  
 
KJ Aiyar Judicial Dictionary Sixteenth Edition 
Trespass. The act of breaking into computers or networks 
either without authorization or in excess of one’s authorization. 
A forcible entry on the land of another with strong hand and 
against the will of the owner constitutes a trespass.

After having an overview of the definition of terms “Adverse 
Possession” and “trespass” given in various law dictionaries when 
claim of petitioners is examined, there remains no cavil that they are 
not claiming protection of their possession on the plea of “Adverse 
Possession”. In this way when the petitioners have no title to the suit 
property they can only be termed as “trespassers”. 
10. 
Before moving further it would not be out of context to 
mention here that initially adverse possession was duly recognized 
by law and it was protected under Section 28 and Article 144 of the 
Limitation Act, 1908 but both these provisions were declared 
repugnant as against the injunctions of Islam in the case of 
 وبقمل
ادمح انبم وکحمت پ اتسکن (1991 SCMR 2063). The relevant extract 
from the same is reproduced below :- 

Civil Revision No.689-D of 2012

11. 
In the above backdrop it would not be out of context to 
observe that with the afflux of time illegal possession upon the 
property of the other, irrespective of howsoever it is long, would not 
extinguish the ownership of the actual owner and validate the 
possession of trespasser. Reference to this effect can be made to the 
case of MUHAMMAD ZAMAN versus NAZIR AHMED and 2 others (2003 
CLC 1628) wherein this Court held as under :- 
“4. Now according to the reasoning of the learned lower Courts 
the petitioner has not proved his possession over the said property 
nor has he proved his dispossession by the respondents in the year 
1985. Now whereas the learned trial Court has found the suit to be 
barred by time without reference to any provision of Limitation 
Act. The learned Appellate Court has referred to Articles 142 and 
144 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1908. Under Article 
142 the prescribed period of 12 years for a suit for possession is to 
commence from the date of dispossession or discontinuation of 
possession. Under Article 144 the prescribed period of 12 years is 
to commence from a point of time when the possession of the 
defendant in the suit becomes adverse to the plaintiff. Now going 
by the findings of the learned lower Courts that the petitioner 
never took possession of the land under the said decree, Article 
142 would not apply. As there is no question of dispossession or 
discontinuation of possession while a plaintiff is in possession. 
This leaves Article 144. Under this provision the starting point of 
limitation is when the possession of the defendant becomes 
adverse to the plaintiff. The finding of the learned lower Courts is 
that possession of the respondent is not adverse. This being so, 
they have acted without jurisdiction in holding the suit to be 
barred by time. 
5. Now according to the said case of Mahboob Khan cited by the 
learned counsel for the respondents it has been held that the 
limitation for a first application for execution of a decree is three 
years as prescribed in Article 181 of the Limitation Act, 1908. To 
my mind the said proposition is not involved in this case where 
we are dealing with the limitation for suit for possession. 
However, the judgment in the case of Alam Din alias Alam Sher 
and 3 others cited by learned counsel does deal with a suit for 
possession. Now the learned counsel particularly relies on the 
following observations of the Honourable Court in para. 18 of the 
judgment at page 10 of the report:-- 
"We think that it is no practically a settled law that if a person 
with title fails to sue for possession or execute the decree for 
possession or declaration which he has in his favour for 
twelve years, the person holding such a property adversely to 
the true owner for more than twelve years, after the decree or 

Civil Revision No.689-D of 2012 
 
-8- 
 
dispossession of the owner, becomes full owner in 
extinguishing the title of the true owner. (underlining is mine). 
Now it will be seen that their Lordships also insisted that the 
possession has to be adverse to the true owner in order to 
extinguish his title by prescription. In the present case, as held by 
me above, it is an interpartes finding that possession of the 
respondent has never been adverse. 
6. Thus the possession of the respondents not being adverse, 
whatever the length of said possession may be, it will not result in 
extinguishment of the title of the petitioner. Needless to state that 
so long as the title vests in the petitioner he is entitled to get the 
possession of the land on the basis of the same.” 
12. 
In somewhat similar facts and circumstances Peshawar High 
Court in the case of Malik MUHAMMAD HUSSAIN versus SAADULLAH 
KHAN (2014 CLC 311) held as under :- 
“10. 
The plea of the petitioner that being trespasser he has the 
protection of law is not tenable as law does not come to the rescue 
of a person who on the one hand, violates a law and seeks refuge 
behind an other for the protection of his unlawful interest. 
Reliance is placed on 1968 SCMR 1286 whereby leave was 
refused by the Supreme Court of Pakistan from a judgment of 
High Court in which the High Court had declined to interfere with 
the orders of settlement authorities on the view that a trespasser 
was neither entitled to the transfer of a house under the Displaced 
Persons (Compensation  and Rehabilitation) Act nor competent to 
move the High  Court in the exercise of its constitutional 
jurisdiction. (Underlining supplied). 
11. 
Similar view was expressed in another judgment by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan reported in PLD 1982 Supreme Court 
page 308 wherein their Lordships have that "the appellant 
Anjuman, on other hand had no 'legitimate' right whatsoever on 
the land in dispute because its status, on its own admission was 
only that of a trespasser. It entered into the land in question 
without the permission of the relevant authorities and started 
using it for own purpose without any authorization. (Underlining 
supplied)” 
Even otherwise knocking out the deceased respondent on account 
of limitation would amount to give premium to the petitioners under 
the obsolete provisions of law i.e. Sections 28 and 144 of the 
Limitation Act, 1908, which have already been declared as deviant to 
the Quranic injunctions.  
13. 
So far judgment in the case of Muhammad Iqbal’s relied 
upon by learned counsel for the petitioners is concerned, it is 
observed that in the said case both the parties were litigating and 
canvassing their respective titles to the suit property which is not so 
in the present case thus the principles laid down therein are not 
applicable to the case at hand. Next comes the judgment in the case 
of Wazir Khan’s supra, perusal whereof reveals that said judgment is 

Civil Revision No.689-D of 2012 
 
-9- 
 
founded on entirely different facts and circumstances. Parties to the 
said case were raising their respective claims with regard to the suit 
land and challenging the vires of the mutation being outcome of 
fraud and misrepresentation which is not the case here. With all 
reverence to the principles laid down therein qua which no other 
opinion can be formed, it is observed that as the facts and 
circumstances of the present case are distinguishable, so reliance on 
the said judgment by learned counsel for the petitioners would be of 
no avail. So far judgment in the case of Sultan Mahmood Shah 
supra is concerned, it evinces therefrom that both the parties were 
claiming title qua the suit property whereas in the present case, the 
petitioners are not disputing the title of the deceased respondent, 
which is an apparent distinctive feature. 
14. 
This petition is though arising out of divergent views of the 
courts below as the conclusion are contrary to each other but this 
Court, while exercising revisional jurisdiction is supposed to make 
comparative analysis of both the judgments in order to determine 
their validity on the touchstones of Section 115 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure (V of 1908). It is cardinal principle of law that in the 
matter of giving preference to the judgments of lower courts, while 
analyzing the same in exercise of revisional jurisdiction, the 
preference and regard is always given to the findings of the appellate 
court, unless those are suffering with any legal infirmity or material 
irregularity. Reference in this respect, if needed can safely be made 
to the case of MUHAMMAD NAWAZ through L.Rs versus Haji MUHAMMAD 
BARAN KHAN through L.Rs. and others (2013 SCMR 1300). Relevant 
extract from the same is reproduced herein below:- 
“12………We have also taken into consideration the judgment of 
the Appellate Court which is based on proper appraisal of 
evidence on record and the findings of the Appellate Court are to 
be preferred as it has been held by this Court in the cases of 
Madan Gopal and others vs Maran Bepari and others (PLD 1969 
SC 617) that if the findings of fact reached by the first appellate 
Court is at variance with that of the trial Court, the former will 
ordinarily prevail, although it would not possess the same value or 
sanctity as a concurrent finding.” This view also finds support 
from the cases of Muhammad Shafi and others vs. Sultan 
Mahmood and others (2010 SCMR 827)……..” 

Civil Revision No.689-D of 2012 
 
-10- 
 
The above view also finds support from the cases of AMJAD IKRAM 
versus Mst. ASIYA KAUSAR and 2 others (2015 SCMR 1) and MUHAMMAD 
HAFEEZ and another versus DISTRICT JUDGE, KARACHI EAST and another 
(2008 SCMR 398). 
15. 
After having a comparative analysis of both the judgments, I 
am of the firm view that the learned Additional District Judge, 
Chakwal has rightly interfered with the judgment passed by the 
learned Civil Judge, Chakwal. The petitioners have failed to point 
out any illegality or material irregularity in the impugned judgment, 
warranting interference by this Court in exercise of revisional 
jurisdiction so as to set at naught the impugned judgment. The 
instant petition thus fails and is dismissed with no order as to costs.
