4. 
According to said reports, surviving legal heirs of Muhammad Hayat 
(deceased of the case) are two widows namely Mst. Fatima and              
Mst. Khatoon, son namely Muhammad Asad, daughters namely Mst. 
Saima Bibi, Mst. Iram and Mst. Kiran, brother namely Zulifqar, sisters 
namely Mst. Nooran Bibi, Mst. Khairan/Muneeran Bibi and Mst. Shehnaz, 
nephew (Bhanja) namely Muhammad Uqba and niece (Bhanji) namely 
Mst. Samina Bibi; said reports further reveal that all of them except 
Zulifqar and Mst. Khairan Bibi/Muneeran Bibi (brother and sister of the 
deceased, respectively) have entered into compromise with the appellants 
with their free will and consent and without any coercion and have forgiven 
them (convicts/appellants) in the name of Allah Almighty by waiving their 
right of Qisas and Diyat and have no objection if they are acquitted from this 
case on the basis of compromise. In above scenario, learned Sessions Judge, 
Chiniot submitted that compromise is incomplete because two legal heirs 
namely Zulifqar and Khairan Bibi/Muneeran Bibi (brother and sister of the 
deceased, respectively) have got recorded their statements with the 
averments that they have not entered into compromise with the 
appellants/convicts. However, being not satisfied with the aforementioned 
reports, fresh reports were requisitioned from learned Sessions Judge, 
Chiniot, vide order dated: 24.01.2024 passed by this Court with the 
direction to prepare list of legal heirs of the deceased now competent to 
enter into compromise in the case and in pursuance of the same, learned 
Sessions Judge, Chiniot has furnished fresh reports bearing letter 
No.226/D-4 dated: 30.01.2024 (in Crl. Appeal No.79782-J/2022), letter 
No.227/D-4 dated: 30.01.2024 (in Crl. Appeal No.79783-J/2022) and letter 
No.228/D-4 dated: 30.01.2024 (in Crl. Appeal No.79784-J/2022) again on 
the similar footings while mentioning/clarifying therein that Rehman 
(father of the deceased) died before the murder of Muhammad Hayat

Criminal Appeal No.79784-J/2022

(deceased), however, Fatima Bibi (mother) died after the occurrence and 
she (Fatima Bibi) was survived by one son namely Zulifqar and four 
daughters namely Nooran Bibi, Khairan, Shehnaz and Bakhtan, one 
paternal grandson namely Muhammad Asad, three paternal granddaughters 
namely Saima Bibi, Iram and Kiran; said pedigreetable further reflected 
that Bakhtan (fourth daughter of Fatima Bibi/sister of Muhammad Hayat 
deceased) also died after the occurrence leaving two children namely 
Muhammad Uqba and Samina Bibi and finally it was again mentioned in 
said reports by learned Sessions Judge, Chiniot that compromise has not 
been effected between the appellants and all the legal heirs of Muhammad 
Hayat (deceased).  
 
5. 
Learned counsel for the appellants submits that Rehman (father of 
the deceased) and Mst. Fatima Bibi (mother of the deceased) have died 
whereas remaining legal heirs of the deceased i.e. both widows, son and 
daughters of the deceased have entered into compromise with all the three 
appellants who have been convicted under Section: 302 (b) PPC and 
sentenced under Ta’zir, therefore, compromise has been effected in 
accordance with law and reports of learned Sessions Judge, Chiniot while 
mentioning that compromise is incomplete because one brother and one 
sister of the deceased have not entered into compromise is against the 
settled principles of law on the subject, therefore, to said extent said reports 
are not having any legal value and as such are liable to be ignored. Learned 
counsel finally prays for acceptance of these appeals and acquittal of the 
appellants on the basis of compromise. 
 
6. 
Learned Prosecutor General, Punjab assisted by learned Deputy 
Prosecutors General, Punjab submits that in this case, deceased is survived 
by son, daughters and two widows and though at the time of murder of 
Muhammad Hayat (deceased), his mother namely Fatima Bibi was also his 
legal heir but after her death, now only direct surviving legal heirs of 
Muhammad Hayat (deceased) can effect compromise because punishment 
has been awarded under Ta’zir and in such backdrop, sisters, brother, 
nephew and niece cannot be termed as surviving legal heirs of the 
deceased; finally submits that reports of learned Sessions Judge, Chiniot to 

Criminal Appeal No.79782-J/2022,  
Criminal Appeal No.79783-J/2022 & 
Criminal Appeal No.79784-J/2022

said extent are misconceived, however, submits that since offence under 
Section: 302 (b) PPC is compoundable and same has rightly been 
compounded by  surviving legal heirs of the deceased, therefore, in the 
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, he has no objection on the 
acceptance of these appeals and acquittal of appellants/convicts in this case 
on the basis of compromise.  
7. 
Learned counsel for the complainant while adopting/supporting 
arguments advanced by learned counsel for the appellants as well as 
learned Prosecutor General, Punjab assisted by learned Deputy Prosecutors 
General, Punjab, submits that he has no objection on acceptance of these 
appeals and acquittal of the appellants.  
8. 
 
Arguments heard.  Record perused. 
9. 
 
Admittedly in this case, appellants have been convicted under 
Section: 302 (b) PPC and sentenced as Ta’zir. It is trite law that direct 
surviving legal heirs of the deceased are quite competent to effect 
compromise under Section: 345 (2) Cr.P.C. where punishment has been 
passed as Ta’zir. In this case, Mst. Fatima and Mst. Khatoon (two widows 
of the deceased), Muhammad Asad (son), Saima Bibi, Iram and Kiran 
(daughters of the deceased) are the only surviving legal heirs of the 
deceased as Rehman and Mst.Fatima Bibi (father and mother of the 
deceased, respectively) have died.  It is worth mentioning here that 
Rehman (father of the deceased) died prior to murder of the deceased, 
however, though Mst.Fatima Bibi (mother) died after the occurrence yet 
her legal heirs cannot be termed as legal heirs of Muhammad Hayat 
(deceased) by any stretch of imagination for the purpose of compromise in 
this case. In this regard, guidance has been sought from the dictum laid 
down by the larger Bench of Supreme Court of Pakistan in case titled as 
“MUHAMMAD YOUSAF versus THE STATE and others.” (PLD 2019 
Supreme Court 461); relevant paragraphs of said judgment are hereby 
reproduced for ready reference:- 
“7. 
 
It is not disputed that the case in hand is a case of Ta'zir 
and not of Qisas because the proof required for a case of Qisas in terms 
of section 304, P.P.C. was not adduced in this case before the trial court. 
It may be clarified here that a criminal case becomes a case of Qisas 
when, after the case has reached the trial court, either a confession is

Criminal Appeal No.79783-J/2022 & 
Criminal Appeal No.79784-J/2022 
6 
made by the accused person before the trial court during the trial or 
Tazkiva-tul-shahood (scrutiny of the witnesses before trial of the accused 
person) is undertaken by the trial court and unless either of the said two 
things happen before the trial court every criminal case is to be treated 
as a case of Ta'zir at every stage of the case including the stage of 
investigation. Compounding of offences in cases of Ta'zir is governed by 
section 345, Cr.P.C. and according to section 345(2), Cr.P.C. (as the said 
legal provision stood in the year 2005 when the offences in the present 
case had been committed) the offence of qatl-i-amd under section 302, 
P.P.C. could be compounded with the permission of the relevant court 
"By the heirs of the victim other than the accused or the convict if the 
offence has been committed by him in the name or on the pretext of karo 
kari, siyah kari or similar other customs or practices". The said legal 
provision was amended on 21.10.2016 and it presently reads as "By the 
heirs of the victim subject to the provisions of section 311, P.P.C.." 
According to the law in this country succession opens at the time of 
death of a person and upon his death his assets automatically stand 
devolved upon those who are entitled to inherit from him in specified 
shares in terms of his personal law and such inheriting persons are 
called the heirs of the deceased. There is, thus, no confusion in our law 
that an heir is a person who is entitled to inherit from the deceased at the 
time of his death. In view of this settled and recognized principle when 
the law of the land provides that in a case of Ta'zir an offence of qatl-i-
amd under section 302, P.P.C. may be compounded by the "heirs of the 
victim" and when an heir of a victim is only a person who inherits 
directly from the victim then what is clearly meant by section 345(2), 
Cr.P.C. is that only a person who can directly inherit from the victim is 
the person who can compound the offence of qatl-i-amd of the victim 
and none else.” 
 
“10. 
In the present case of Ta'zir the offence of murder of Muhammad 
Aslam could be compounded only by the heirs of the said victim and all 
the surviving heirs of that victim had voluntarily compounded the said 
offence with respondents Nos.2 and 3. The High Court was, therefore, 
quite correct in holding that the appellant and his brothers, who were 
heirs of a subsequently dying heir of the victim, were not relevant to the 
matter of compounding of the offence.” 
“11. 
 The argument that in his lifetime Warvam, the father and one of 
the heirs of Muhammad Aslam deceased, had refused to join the 
compromise between the remaining heirs of the deceased and 
respondents Nos. 2 and 3 and, therefore, after the death of Warvam any 
compromise between the remaining heirs of Muhammad Aslam deceased 
and the said respondents could not be complete without the heirs of 
Warvam joining the same had failed to impress the High Court and we 
have also not felt persuaded to accept the same. As already observed 
above, the concept of devolving of the right of Qisas upon an heir of an 
heir/wali of the victim relevant to a case of Qsas is not applicable to 
cases of Ta'zir. In the absence of any devolving of the capacity to 
compound in a case of Ta'zir the capacity to compound possessed by an 
heir of the victim at the time of murder of the victim stands exhausted 
upon the subsequent death of that heir. Being the father and an heir of 
Muhammad Aslam deceased Warvam had a capacity to compound the 
relevant offence but he had not compounded the offence during his own 
lifetime and upon Warvam's death his capacity to compound stood 
exhausted and the same was not heritable as Warvam's heirs were not 
heirs of Muhammad Aslam deceased because they did not, and could 
not, inherit from him. After Waryam's death his heirs could not be 
treated as heirs of Muhammad Aslam deceased and the only heirs of 

Criminal Appeal No.79782-J/2022,  
Criminal Appeal No.79783-J/2022 & 
Criminal Appeal No.79784-J/2022 
7 
Muhammad Aslam deceased left in the field at such stage were those 
surviving heirs of Muhammad Aslam deceased who could inherit directly 
from him and they could compound the offence throughout their lifetime 
irrespective of timing of Warvam's death. In cases of Ta'zir section 
345(2), Cr.P.C. does not specify any time when compounding of an 
offence may take place and the provisions of section 345(2), Cr.P.C. do 
not place any embargo upon compounding of the relevant offence by the 
surviving heirs of a victim at a time when one or more of the heirs of the 
victim has/have already died. Placing an embargo upon the surviving 
heirs of a victim in such a situation may amount to committing violence 
upon the provisions of section 345(2), Cr.P.C. which we are not ready to 
commit.” 
“15. 
As a result of the discussion made above we have not been able to 
take any legitimate exception to the impugned judgment passed by the 
Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, Multan. The case in hand was not a 
case of Qisas but was of Ta'zir. Under the Islamic law of inheritance the 
brothers of Muhammad Aslam deceased in this case did not inherit from 
the deceased directly and even when the father of Muhammad Aslam 
deceased, an heir of the said deceased, subsequently died the brothers of 
Muhammad Aslam deceased, including the present appellant, did not 
become Muhammad Aslam deceased's heirs because they stood excluded 
by a surviving son of Muhammad Aslam deceased who was closer to the 
deceased in degree in the matter of inheritance. In this case of Ta'zir 
only the heirs of the deceased could compound the offence of murder 
and the appellant and his brothers, all brothers of Muhammad Aslam 
deceased, did not and could not inherit from Muhammad Aslam 
deceased either directly or through their father and, thus, they never 
qualified as "heirs of the victim" for the purposes of section 345(2), 
Cr.P.C. This appeal is, therefore, dismissed.” 
 
 
 
 
(emphasis added) 
 
Though as per reports of learned Sessions Judge, Chiniot (mentioned 
above), compromise is incomplete between the legal heirs of the deceased 
and the appellants because Zulifqar and Mst. Khairan Bibi (brother and 
sister of the deceased, respectively) have not entered into compromise, 
however, keeping in view the dictum laid down in Muhammad Yousaf’s 
case (supra), Zulifqar and Mst. Khairan Bibi (mentioned above) are not 
legal heirs of Muhammad Hayat (deceased of the case) for the purpose of 
compounding the offence as this is case of Ta’zir, so aforementioned 
reports of learned Sessions Judge, Chiniot to said extent are misconceived 
and as such discarded.  
Learned counsel for the appellants, learned Prosecutor General, 
Punjab assisted by learned Prosecutors General, Punjab as well as learned 
counsel for the complainant are not at variance for sanctioning the approval 
to the compromise reached between the appellants and aforementioned 
surviving legal heirs of Muhammad Hayat (deceased). Statements of above 
said legal heirs of the deceased reflect that the compromise between the 

Criminal Appeal No.79782-J/2022,  
Criminal Appeal No.79783-J/2022 & 
Criminal Appeal No.79784-J/2022

appellants and above said legal heirs is genuine and they have arrived at a 
compromise with their free will and without any duress or coercion. In 
view thereof, when the proposed compromise between legal heirs of the 
deceased and appellants is likely to promote the cause of peace in the 
locality/society as well as betterment of present and coming generations of 
the parties and particularly when no element of “Fisad-fil-Arz” within the 
meaning of Section: 311 PPC has been found from the facts and 
circumstances of the case, then it is appropriate to grant permission/leave 
for effecting the compromise within the meaning of Section: 345 (2) (5) 
Cr.P.C. Hence, permission/leave for effecting compromise between the 
appellants and legal heirs of the deceased is granted by allowing the 
application bearing Crl. Misc. No.1/2023 {filed by Zafar (appellant) in Crl. 
Appeal No.79782-J/2022}, application bearing Crl. Misc. No.1/2023 {filed 
by Mazhar (appellant) in Crl. Appeal No.79783-J/2022} and application 
bearing Crl. Misc. No.2/2023 {filed by Feroz (appellant) in Crl. Appeal 
No.79784-J/2022}. Accordingly, titled appeals bearing Crl. Appeal 
No.79782-J/2022, Crl. Appeal No.79783-J/2022 and Crl. Appeal 
No.79784-J/2022 are also accepted, as a result whereof, convictions 
recorded and sentences awarded to Zafar, Mazhar and Feroz (appellants) 
vide judgment dated: 31.10.2022 passed by learned Additional Sessions 
Judge, Lalian, District Chiniot/trial court, are hereby set-aside, Zafar, 
Mazhar and Feroz (appellants/convicts) are acquitted of the charge within 
the meaning of Section: 345 (6) Cr.P.C. in case arising out of F.I.R. 
No.431/2018 dated: 25.11.2018  registered under Sections: 302, 34 PPC at 
Police Station: Lalian, District Chiniot. Appellants will be released 
forthwith if not required in any other case.
