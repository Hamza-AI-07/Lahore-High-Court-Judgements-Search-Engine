Through instant petition under Section 115 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred to 
as “C.P.C.”) the petitioners assail the vires of judgment and 
decree dated 14th October, 2014, whereby learned Additional 
District Judge, Pindigheb, while dismissing appeal preferred 
by their predecessor-in-interest namely Muhammad Saleem 
(hereinafter referred to as “pre-emptor”) affirmed the 
judgment and decree dated 12th March, 2014 passed by the 
learned Civil Judge Class-I, Pindigheb District Attock. 
2. 
Briefly the facts necessary for adjudication of instant 
petition are that the pre-emptor instituted a suit for 
possession through pre-emption averring therein that suit 
land was purchased by the respondent through mutation 
No.507 dated 31st January, 2011 in lieu of sale consideration 
of Rs.15,000/-, however, in order to defeat the right of pre-
emption of the pre-emptor, sale consideration was 
mentioned as Rs.30,000/-. As per averments contained in the 
plaint, pre-emptor attained the knowledge of sale on 17th 
February, 2011 at 10:00 am when he was present in his 
house and the information was disclosed by Saeed Akhtar in 
presence of Abdul Aziz. It is the case of the pre-emptor that 

Civil Revision No.1068-D of 2014 
                                               -2- 
 
immediately on attaining the knowledge, he performed 
necessary Talbs in furtherance of his superior right of pre-
emption. Suit was contested by the respondent by filing 
written statement, wherein the assertions contained in the 
plaint were controverted. The respective stances of the 
parties put forth in the pleadings resulted into framing of 
multiple issues. After framing of issues, evidence of both the 
sides was recorded and on completion of the same, suit was 
dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 12th March, 2014. 
The pre-emptor, being dissatisfied with the above said 
judgment and decree though preferred an appeal before the 
learned Additional District Judge, Pindigheb, but the same 
was also dismissed vide impugned judgment and decree 
dated 14th October, 2014.  
3. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the 
pre-emptor was possessed with a superior right of pre-
emption and as such he exercised his right by performance 
of 
necessary 
Talbs. 
It 
is 
contended 
that 
though 
overwhelming evidence was produced to this effect but suit 
was dismissed without due appreciation of the same. 
Learned counsel maintained that findings of courts below 
qua performance of Talbs are not tenable. It is contended 
that concurrent findings are thus not tenable at all.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel appearing on behalf of 
the respondent, while defending the judgments under 
challenge, submitted that there are concurrent findings of 
facts recorded by both the courts below, which are in 
consonance with the material available on the record. 
Learned counsel submitted that the respondent after 
purchase of the suit land obtained the possession of the 
same, which fact was well in the knowledge of the pre-
emptor right from the first day. He maintained that the pre-
emptor failed to prove his superior right of pre-emption as 
well as performance of necessary Talbs. 

Civil Revision No.1068-D of 2014

5. 
Heard. Record perused.  
6. 
Before adverting to the merits of the case it would be 
apposite to observe that the pre-emptor died during the 
pendency of this petition and after his death the petitioners 
have joined the proceedings being his legal heirs. Section 16 
of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 (hereinafter referred to 
as “Act, 1991”) provides that where a pre-emptor dies after 
making any of the demand under Section 13 of the Act ibid, 
the right of pre-emption shall transfer to his legal heirs. 
7. 
From the perusal of record it reveals that the pre-
emptor while canvassing his superior right instituted the 
suit in order to pre-empt the suit land. It is time and again 
held by the superior courts that existence and enforcement of 
pre-emption right are two distinct and different phenomena 
and mere having a superior right of pre-emption by itself is 
not sufficient to succeed in a suit for pre-emption. The pre-
emptor has to establish the performance of necessary Talbs 
as required under Section 13 of the Act, 1991 in order to 
succeed in a suit for pre-emption. 
8. 
Talb-i-Muwathibat is the basic foundation of the right of 
pre-emption which is to be performed immediately on 
attaining the knowledge about the sale. Even wastage of a 
single moment in performance of Talb-i-Muwathibat is 
sufficient to damage the right of pre-emption. For the purpose 
of determining the fate of Talb-i-Muwathibat time, date and 
place always play a significant role. The pre-emptor(s) is/are 
always obliged to lead cogent and unimpeachable evidence to 
establish his/their right through performance of necessary 
Talbs. While going through the evidence, it is observed that 
the evidence of the pre-emptor is highly discrepant qua the 
above aspects. As per plaint, the information was received by 
the pre-emptor through Saeed Akhtar (PW2) on 17th 
February, 2011 at 10:00 am when he was present in his house 
in presence of Abdul Aziz (PW3), however, while appearing 

Civil Revision No.1068-D of 2014 
                                               -4- 
 
as PW1 he did not mention the time on which information was 
received from Saeed Akhtar (PW2). Even otherwise Abdul 
Aziz (PW3) also did not make clear statement about the place 
of Talb-i-Muwathibat. This omission is fatal for a suit for pre-
emption. There is no cavil that time and date were mentioned 
in the plaint but it is well settled principle of law by now that 
pleadings cannot be a substitute of evidence. Unless a material 
fact which is asserted in the pleadings has been deposed in 
evidence by the witness that cannot be considered or treated as 
valid piece of evidence. This sole aspect is sufficient to shatter 
the case of the pre-emptor because time and place always 
plays a pivotal role for the purpose of analyzing the validity of 
Talb-i-Muwathibat. Reliance in this respect can be placed on 
ALLAH DITTA through L.Rs. and others vs MUHAMMAD ANAR 
(2013 SCMR 866) and Mian PIR MUHAMMAD and another vs 
FAQIR MUHAMMAD through L.Rs. and others (PLD 2007 Supreme 
Court 302). 
9. 
It would not be out of context to mention here that 
Abdul Aziz (PW3) only deposed the date of Talb-i-
Muwathibat and did not state about the month and year 
regarding this material fact. He also deposed that one year 
earlier Saeed Akhtar (PW2) had informed about the impugned 
sale. If such statement of said witness is to be admitted correct 
then it evinces from the record that statement of Abdul Aziz 
(PW3) was recorded on 30th May, 2012 then the date of 
making of Talb-i-Muwathibat becomes 30th May, 2011 
whereas 
the 
pre-emptor 
purportedly 
received 
the 
information on 17th February, 2011. In such situation, story 
relating to Talb-i-Muwathibat is not appealable at all to 
prudent mind. 
10. 
It is noticed that as per stance of the pre-emptor in 
his plaint he attained the knowledge about the sale of suit 
land, while sitting in his house but plaint is silent about the 
exact portion of the house. House is a vast place and non-
mentioning of exact portion by itself is fatal to right of pre-

Civil Revision No.1068-D of 2014 
                                               -5- 
 
emption. Guidance in this respect can be sought from ALLAH 
DITTA through L.Rs. and others versus MUHAMMAD ANAR (2013 
SCMR 866) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held as 
under :- 
“2. 
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and find 
vital discrepancy in the statements of P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.3 
particularly, P.W.1 and P.W.2. P.W.2 stated that the disclosure 
of the sale of suit land was made to them while the plaintiff 
was sitting inside the shop of Aziz, whereas the informer who 
is the son of the pre-emptor, P.W.3 Muhammad Rafique, has 
contradicted the above and in unequivocal, clear and 
unambiguous terms stated that they were sitting outside the 
shop. This was a material discrepancy but the learned 
Appellate Court had failed to notice the same and it has also 
been overlooked by the learned Revisional Court…….” 
Reference in this respect can also be made to the cases of 
NOOR MUHAMMAD SULTAN versus Hafiz ALLAH BAKHSH (2014 
YLR 1381) and MUHAMMAD AFZAL versus ALI MUHAMMAD 
(2014 YLR 87). 
11. 
There is yet another important aspect; claim of pre-
emption always set to motion on the basis of information 
received by the pre-emptor from the informer. As per claim 
of the pre-emptor, he attained the knowledge about the sale 
transaction on 17th February, 2011 from Saeed Akhtar 
(PW2). As per statement of informer, he became acquainted 
with the sale transaction from one Muhammad Ayub but 
said person was never produced in evidence in order to 
prove the source of information. Needless to observe that 
onus to prove the basic source of information through which 
the pre-emptor attained the knowledge of sale always rests 
upon him. The pre-emptor was though obliged to establish 
whole chain of information but it is clearly missing in the 
present case, which even otherwise is very essential element 
to prove Talb-e-Muwathibat. Guidance in this respect can be 
sought from FARID ULLAH KHAN versus IRFAN ULLAH KHAN 
(2022 SCMR 1231). The relevant extract from the same is 
reproduced below :- 
“Source of information of sale - hearsay evidence  

Civil Revision No.1068-D of 2014 
                                               -6- 
 
8.2 Secondly, no person who could have testified that he 
had direct knowledge of the sale of the suit land, has been 
examined by the respondent. All the evidence produced on 
the source of information, as to the sale of the suit land, is 
hearsay. The brother of the respondent, Farman Ullah (PW-
4), who had informed him about the sale of the suit land, 
could not tell the names of the persons, who were talking 
about sale of the suit land in the Chok of the village, except 
the one who had died. Thus, no one was produced by the 
respondent to substantiate the version of Farman Ullah (PW-
4) of how he had come to know of the sale. 
8.3 In Subhanuddin v. Pir Ghulam, a case of similar 
facts, where the person who had conveyed the information of 
the sale to the brother of the pre-emptor, who in turn passed 
it onto the pre-emptor, as is in the present case, was not 
produced as a witness. Based on the said facts, this Court 
held that the elements of Talb-i-Muwathibat had not been 
proved, with the following observation: 
"7. It was the respondent's case that upon his return from 
Punjab he was informed about the sale by his brother 
(Taj Ali). Taj Ali, lives in the same house as the 
respondent, but did not know whether the respondent was 
in the village when the sale took place, nor when the 
respondent returned from the Punjab and that he was 
informed about the sale by his nephew Nazir. The initial 
burden of proof with regard to these facts (the conveying 
of the information of sale and price) lay upon the 
respondent, and to establish the same Nazir could have 
been called to give evidence, as the evidence in this 
regard (which was oral) was required to be direct and of 
the witness who saw, heard or perceived it himself 
(Article 71 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984), but 
Nazir was not produced as a witness. Consequently, an 
important and relevant fact was not proved by the 
respondent and on this ground alone the suit merited 
dismissal as Talb-i-Muwathibat is required to be made 
immediately upon learning of the sale". 
 
 
 
 
 
  
(Emphasis added) 
In essence, this Court in the above case came to the 
conclusion in view of the provisions of Article 71 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984, which mandates that oral evidence 
must be direct, that is to say, if it refers to a fact, which 
could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness who says 
he saw it; if it refers to a fact, which could be heard, it must 
be the evidence of a witness who says he heard it; if it refers 
to a fact, which could be perceived by any other sense or in 
any other manner, it must be the evidence of a witness who 
says he perceived it by that sense or in that manner; and if it 
refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion 
is held, it must be, subject to the proviso, the evidence of the 
person who holds that opinion on those grounds. 
8.4 The fact of a sale of land is a fact that can be seen, 
such as, by observing or taking part in the sale-transaction or 
by seeing the sale deed or sale mutation. The person who 
conveys the information of the fact of sale must be a person 
who has seen the fact of sale and it is he who can then pass 
on the said fact to another person(s). Thus, the chain of the 
source of information, as to the fact of sale, from the very 

Civil Revision No.1068-D of 2014 
                                               -7- 
 
first person, who has the direct knowledge thereof and 
passes on the same to the person who lastly informs the pre-
emptor, must be complete. Only the complete chain of the 
source of information of the sale can establish the essential 
elements of Talb-i-Muwathibat, which are: (i) the time, date 
and place when the pre-emptor obtained the first information 
of the sale, and; (ii) the immediate declaration of his 
intention by the pre-emptor to exercise his right of pre-
emption, then and there, on obtaining such information. In 
the present case, such chain of the source of passing on the 
information, as to the fact of sale of the suit land has not 
been proved, and the entire case as to making of Talb-i-
Muwathibat is built on the hearsay evidence of the 
respondent's brother, Farman Ullah (PW-4). This omission 
raises doubts on the veracity and truthfulness of the 
witnesses produced by pre-emptor.” 
 Reference to the above effect can also be made to 
MUHAMMAD RIAZ versus MUHAMMAD AKRAM and others (2024 
SCMR 692) and SUBHANUDDIN and others versus PIR GHULAM 
(PLD 2015 Supreme Court 69). 
12. 
Needless to mention that the respondent specifically 
denied the performance of Talbs in his written statement, so 
it was incumbent upon the pre-emptor to lead tangible 
evidence in order to substantiate the performance of Talbs. 
When once the pre-emptor failed to prove first Talb i.e. 
Talb-i-Muwathibat, which is the basic foundation for the 
whole edifice of pre-emption right, there remains no need to 
advert to the second Talb because if first Talb is not proved 
then the entire structure would crumble down. 
13. 
There are concurrent findings of facts recorded by 
both the courts below. After having scrutinized the record, I 
am of the considered view that concurrent findings arrived at 
by both the courts below are based on proper appraisal of 
evidence and there is no misreading or non-reading of 
evidence on part of any of the court below. The revisional 
jurisdiction is to be exercised, while keeping in view the 
principles enshrined in Section 115 of the C.P.C. The 
superior courts are always reluctant to interfere with the 
concurrent findings, unless some patent illegality or material 
irregularity crept up on the record or pointed out by the 
petitioner(s). The exercise of revisional powers is always 

Civil Revision No.1068-D of 2014 
                                               -8- 
 
guided by the necessary pre-conditions laid down in the 
above referred provision of law. The scanning of evidence 
and the perusal of impugned judgments does not reflect any 
illegality or material irregularity, justifying interference by 
this Court. Reference in this respect can be made to Mst. 
ZARSHEDA versus NOBAT KHAN (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 21), 
MUHAMMAD SARWAR and others versus HASHMAL KHAN and 
others (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 13) and GHULAM QADIR and 
others versus Sh. ABDUL WADOOD and others (PLD 2016 Supreme 
Court 712). 
14. 
In view of above discussion, instant petition being 
devoid of any merits is dismissed in limine.
