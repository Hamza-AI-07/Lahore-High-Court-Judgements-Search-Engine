MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This petition under Section 115 
of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred to as 
“C.P.C.”) arises out of judgment and decree dated 22nd February, 
2017, whereby the learned Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, 
while dismissing the appeal preferred by the petitioners affirmed the 
judgment and decree dated 25th June, 2010 passed by the learned 
Civil Judge Class-I, Rawalpindi. 
2. 
Brief facts forming background of this petition are that 
Pakistan Railways (“petitioners”) invited tender for purchase of 
building material from the registered contractors. The respondent 
being the registered government contractor submitted quotations 
with rates and being the lowest one, he was awarded contract for 
supply of building material worth of Rs.31,65,640/-. On account of 
dispute the respondent instituted a suit for recovery of 
Rs.31,65,640/- with the averments that he had though supplied the 

Civil Revision No.661-D of 2017 
-2- 
 
building material according to the specification but the petitioners 
did not release the outstanding amount. Suit was contested by the 
petitioners on various grounds including the limitation. From the 
divergent pleadings of the parties learned Civil Judge Class-I, 
Rawalpindi framed necessary issues and then recorded evidence of 
both the sides. Suit was ultimately decreed vide judgment dated 25th 
June, 2010. Feeling dissatisfied both the sides preferred their 
respective appeals before the learned Additional District Judge, 
Rawalpindi but same were dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 
22nd February, 2017, hence this petition. 
3. 
This petition is though still at pre-admission stage but in view 
of its pendency since 2017 both the sides have agreed to treat the 
same as pacca case and decide it as such. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that claim of the 
respondent was barred by time and though issue No.10 was framed 
to this effect but both the courts did not properly attend the same. 
Learned counsel submitted that in terms of Article 56 of the 
Limitation Act, 1908 it was incumbent upon the respondent to 
institute the suit within three years from the date of work done. It is 
argued with vehemence that judgments of the courts below are 
though concurrent but are the outcome of gross misreading and non-
reading of evidence. In order to supplement his contentions, learned 
counsel placed reliance on 
SHIFAATULLAH 
QURESHI 
versus 
FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN through Secretary/Chairman, Railways, Ministry 
of Railways (Railway Board), Islamabad (1999 CLC 364) and SUALEH SONS 
(PRIVATE) LIMITED versus KARACHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (1997 
CLC 893).  
5. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that 
suit was instituted well within time as previously the respondent 
approached the Federal Ombudsman and time consumed in the said 
proceedings would be excluded. He added that even otherwise 
Article 115 of the Limitation Act, 1908 would apply to the facts and 
circumstances of the case. Learned counsel maintained that there are 
concurrent findings of facts and the petitioners have failed to point 
out any gross misreading and non-reading of evidence on the part of 

Civil Revision No.661-D of 2017 
-3- 
 
any of the courts below. Placed reliance on MUHAMMAD JAHANGIR, 
PROPRIETOR QADEER BROTHERS versus EXECUTIVE ENGINEER and 
another (1999 MLD 788). 
6. 
Heard. Record perused. 
7. 
As per claim of the respondent he was awarded three contracts 
by the petitioners for supply of building material total amounting to 
Rs.31,65,640/-. It is the stance of the respondent that he though 
supplied the building material in terms of the contracts but his 
amount was withheld by the petitioners without any lawful excuse. 
Entering into the contracts is not disputed by the petitioners but it is 
pleaded that the respondent while in league with the officials of 
Railways committed some irregularities, which were detected by the 
General Manager Pakistan Railways, who constituted a high level 
committee for making probe and in the said proceedings, it was 
established that the respondent embezzled the funds of Pakistan 
Railways.  
8. 
Leaving aside the respective claim of both the sides it is 
noticed that suit was mainly resisted by the petitioners on the ground 
that it is barred by time. To this effect issue No.10 was though 
framed, however, the trial court while deciding the issue of limitation 
held that since the default was committed by the petitioners in 
payment of disputed amount, so they cannot take refuge under the 
law of limitation, which in no way can be termed as a legal 
approach. On the other hand, while dealing with the question of 
limitation the appellate court relied upon Article 115 of the 
Limitation Act, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1908”) and 
held the suit within time. The moot point thus before this Court is as 
to “which provision of the “Act, 1908” would apply to the facts 
and circumstances of the case”.  
9. 
Before pondering upon core issue, it would be apt to have a 
glimpse of Articles 56 & 115 of the “Act, 1908”, which are 
reproduced below :- 
56. 
For the price of work done 
by the plaintiff for the 
defendant at his request, 
where no time has been fixed 
for payment. 
Three 
years 
When work 
is done. 

Civil Revision No.661-D of 2017 
-4- 
 
 
115. 
For 
compensation 
for the breech of any 
contract, express or 
implied, 
not 
in 
writing 
registered 
and 
not 
herein 
specially 
provided 
for. 
Three 
years 
When the contract is 
broken, or (where there 
are successive breaches) 
when the breach in 
respect of which the suit 
is instituted occurs, or 
(where the breach is 
continuing) 
when 
it 
ceases. 
 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
From the bare reading of the above referred provisions of law it is 
manifestly clear that for the claim relating to the price of work done, 
suit is to be governed by Article 56 of the “Act, 1908” whereas 
Article 115 of the Act ibid caters the suit for compensation for the 
breech of any contract, express or implied, not in writing registered 
and not therein specially provided for in the Act. 
10. 
Admittedly the contract was awarded in the year 1999. The 
respondent in the first instance laid his grievance before the  Federal 
Ombudsman on 12th January, 2000 in the shape of complaint, who 
allowed the complaint and directed the petitioners to make 
immediate payment by way of order dated 06th March, 2000. The 
petitioners being aggrieved challenged the order of the Federal 
Ombudsman before the President of Pakistan, who allowed the 
representation by way of order dated 26th October, 2000 and the 
respondent was directed to approach the Civil Court. Suit was then 
instituted on 16th March, 2006. The question which now emanates is 
as to “whether time consumed before the Federal Ombudsman 
can be excluded from being counted towards the limitation for 
instituting the suit under Section 14 of the “Act, 1908”.”  
11. 
For ready reference and convenience Section 14 of the “Act 
1908” is reproduced below :- 
“14. Exclusion of time of proceeding bona fide in Court 
without jurisdiction. (1) In computing the period of limitation 
prescribed for any suit the time during which the plaintiff has 
been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, 
whether in a Court of first instance or in a Court of appeal, 
against the defendant, shall be excluded, where the proceeding 
is founded upon the same cause of action and is prosecuted in 
good faith in a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction, or 
other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it. 

Civil Revision No.661-D of 2017 
-5- 
 
(2) In computing the period of limitation prescribed for any 
application, the time during which the applicant has been 
prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding 
whether in a Court of first instance or in a Court of appeal, 
against the same party for the same relief shall be excluded, 
where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a Court 
which, from defect of jurisdiction, or other cause of a like 
nature, is unable to entertain it.” 
It clearly manifests from the bare reading of the above referred 
provision of law that a plaintiff can only claim exclusion of the time 
from being counted qua limitation if he has been prosecuting with 
due diligence another civil proceedings either in a court of first 
instance or in a court of appeal against the defendant.  
12. 
The proceedings before the Federal Ombudsman cannot be 
termed as civil proceedings at all, so Section 14 of the “Act, 1908” 
would not come to the rescue of the respondent. Reference to this 
effect can be made to SHIFAATULLAH QURESHI versus FEDERATION 
OF PAKISTAN through Secretary/Chairman, Railways, Ministry of Railways 
(Railway Board), Islamabad (1999 CLC 364). The relevant extract from 
the same is reproduced below :- 
“11. The necessary conditions for applying provisions of 
section 14 of the Limitation Act came up for consideration 
before a Division Bench of this Court in Kilachand Devechand 
& Co. (Private) Ltd. v. Messrs Sh. Mian Muhammad Allahbux 
PLD 1962 Kar. 510. The question in that case was as to 
whether the time started running from the date of the first 
award and whether the period spent in making the first award a 
rule of the Court and thereafter, time spent in pursuing the 
application for the execution of the decree is to be counted. The 
appeal against the order of a learned Single Judge of this Court 
was allowed and it was held as follows:----- 
"It will be seen, therefore, that section 14 of the 
Limitation Act comes into play if the following 
conditions are fulfilled: 
(a) That the plaintiff has been prosecuting another civil 
proceeding against the defendant; 
(b) that he has been prosecuting it with due diligence; 
(c) that this proceeding is founded upon the same cause of 
action; 
(d) that it is prosecuted in good faith; and 
(e) that it does not bear fruit because the Court is unable to 
entertain it due to defect of jurisdiction or other cause of 
alike nature." 
12. In the case of Messrs Haroon Textile Mills Ltd. v. Allah 
Ditta PLD 1972 Kar. 57, a suit for damages was filed by the 
respondent, who was an employee of the appellant and who 
developed asthema while serving in the appellants' Company. 
Earlier, the respondent initiated proceedings under the 
Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923, which was terminated by 
the judgment of this Court in Appeal No.94 of 1964 disposed 

Civil Revision No.661-D of 2017 
-6- 
 
of on 9th September, 1965, whereafter he filed the suit. 
Objection was raised that the suit is barred under Article 22 of 
the Limitation Act. It was held by a Division Bench of this 
Court that filing of an application with the Factory Inspector 
for claim in tort can by no stretch of argument be said to be a 
bona fide proceedings fit for the condonation of the delay 
under section 14 of the Limitation Act. The rule laid down in 
the case of Kilachand Devechand (supra) was followed in the 
case of Asmy Trading Company v. Shahadra Ltd. PLD 1975 
Kar. 209 where it was held that the plaintiff was not 
prosecuting the suit in the lower Court with due diligence and 
in good faith as the said plaintiff failed to serve a prior notice 
on the Registrar which omission was held to be a clear case of 
lack of diligence. By now, it is well-settled that in order to 
avail of the provisions of section 14 of the Limitation Act, the 
plaintiff must show that he was diligently pursuing another 
civil proceedings whether in the Court of first instance or in a 
Court of appeal against the same party bona fidely and that the 
Court for defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature 
was unable to entertain the same. (see Imdad Ali and 4 others 
v. Abdul Rashid and 6 others 1983 CLC 1346.” 
13. 
In the case of WAPDA through Authorised Attorney and 4 others 
versus Messrs CRESCENT GROUP OF SERVICES through Authorised Person 
and others (PLD 2013 Lahore 221) this Court while dealing with similar 
proposition held as under :- 
“7. 
So far as the legal contentions are concerned. For 
recovery of amount in lieu of work done, Article 56 of the 
Limitation Act is applicable and that the proceedings before 
Wafaqi Mohtasib are concerned. As Wafaqi Mohtasib is not a 
court, therefore the benefit of section 14 of the Limitation Act 
can also not be given to a person, who consumes any time 
before Wafaqi Mohtasib. Therefore, I fully agree with the 
arguments advanced by learned counsel for the appellants. I 
find that benefit of section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1908 
cannot be claimed by a person who consumed time before 
Wafaqi Mohtasib as Wafaqi Mohtasib is not a Court, therefore 
time consumed there cannot be excluded from the prescribed 
period for filing of a lis.” 
14. 
So far judgment in the case of Muhammad Jahangir’s supra 
is concerned, it is observed that though while dealing with the issue 
relating to the recovery of balance amount and the security it was 
held by this Court that in the circumstances Article 115 of the “Act, 
1908” would come into play being the residuary article but even if 
we proceed on the same premises the cause of action clearly accrued 
to the respondent when he approached the Federal Ombudsman 
through complaint in the year 2000. In that eventuality too suit 
should have been instituted in the year 2003 but it is not so. 

Civil Revision No.661-D of 2017

15. 
There are though concurrent findings of facts recorded by both 
the courts blow but such findings are clearly the outcome of gross 
misreading and non-reading of evidence. The scope of revisional 
jurisdiction is hedged in Section 115 of “C.P.C.” and though 
ordinarily concurrent findings of facts are not disturbed but such 
findings are neither sacrosanct nor it is an inflexible rule that despite 
observing material flaws, the revisional court will abdicate to 
exercise its jurisdiction. The judgments passed by the courts below 
are not based on proper appraisal of evidence and the learned Civil 
Judge, while decreeing the suit of the respondent has grossly misread 
the evidence as already noted hereinabove. The appellate court in the 
circumstances, while upholding the judgment and decree of trial 
court thus committed a material irregularity. This Court under 
Section 115 of “C.P.C.” is thus obliged and fully competent to 
correct such error in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction. Needless 
to observe that when once it is established on the record that 
concurrent findings are fraught with legal infirmities, it becomes the 
bounden duty of court exercising revisional powers to curb and stifle 
such illegalities and material irregularities. Reference in this respect, 
if needed, can be made to Malik MUHAMMAD KHAQAN versus 
TRUSTEES OF THE PORT OF KARACHI (KPT) and another (2008 SCMR 
428) and IMAM DIN and 4 others versus BASHIR AHMED and 10 others 
(PLD 2005 Supreme Court 418). 
16. 
For the foregoing reasons, the instant petition is allowed, 
impugned judgments and decrees are set aside, as a result thereof, 
suit instituted by the respondent shall stand dismissed with no order 
as to costs.
