Date of hearing:     16.12.2024. 
Appellant by: 
Mr. Iftikhar Ahmad Mian, Advocate.  
Respondents by: 
Mr. Imran Khan, Assistant Advocate General 
along with Mian Zahid, Law Officer, Higher 
Education Department.   
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant appeal, appellant has called into question judgment dated 
25.11.2022 (announced in open Court on 16.12.2022), passed by 
learned Single Bench, whereby appellant’s constitutional petition 
challenging vires of notifications dated 14.03.2022 & 31.03.2022 
with regard to revised fee for issuance of new / extension in 
registration certificates to private educational institutions in the 
Province of Punjab, and seeking direction for respondent No.4 / 
Director Public Instructions, Lahore for issuance and maintenance 
of Registration Certificate of appellant’s institutions without any 
specific time period or any specific educational module or 
enhancement of fee etc., was dismissed.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that appellant is an educational 
institution and claims to have been running 262 campuses 
throughout the Punjab, providing education up till Masters level for 
the last about three and a half decade, which was previously 
registered with respondent No.4 / Director Public Instructions 

 
 
ICA No.1379 of 2023 
 
2
Colleges, Punjab, Lahore as required under the provisions of the 
Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) 
Ordinance, 1984 (“the Ordinance of 1984”). In the years 
2018/2019, respondents No.2 & 3 issued two separate notifications 
dated 13.07.2018 & 21.08.2019, wherein they fixed time schedule 
for submission of an application for registration of institution. Said 
notifications were challenged by appellant by way of filing W.P. 
No.5893 of 2019, which was allowed by this Court vide judgment 
dated 29.04.2020, reported as Punjab College through Principal v. 
Government of Punjab through Chief Secretary and others (2020 
MLD 1502), whereafter registration certificate was issued. 
However, later on, impugned notifications dated 14.03.2022 & 
31.03.2022 were issued by respondent No.2 / Secretary, Higher 
Education Department, Government of the Punjab, Lahore, with 
partial modification with regard to revised fee schedule for issuance 
of new / extension in registration certificates to private educational 
institutions in the Province of Punjab. Feeling disgruntled, appellant 
assailed aforesaid notifications by way of filing constitutional 
petition, which was dismissed by learned Single Bench vide 
judgment dated 25.11.2022 (announced in open Court on 
16.12.2022). Hence, instant appeal.  
3. 
Learned counsel for appellant submits that the notifications 
challenged through appellant’s constitutional petition are violative 
of the Sections 2(4), 3(1)(3) & 6(1) of the Ordinance of 1984 and 
enhancement of fee at exorbitant rate is not only violation of the 
principle of reasonability but also contrary to Rule 5 of the Punjab 
Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Rules, 
1984 (“the Rules of 1984”). He argues that fixation of time for 
registration certificate is beyond the scope of law and the applicable 
Rules. In the end, he submits that impugned notifications are 
unsustainable in the eye of law. In support, he has relied upon 
Messrs Mehraj Flour Mills and others v. Provincial Government 
and others (2001 SCMR 1806), Allah Ditta and others v. Province 

 
 
ICA No.1379 of 2023 
 
3
of Punjab (PLD 1997 Lahore 499) and Punjab College through 
Principal v. Government of Punjab through Chief Secretary and 
others (2020 MLD 1502).  
4. 
Contrarily, learned Law Officer defends the impugned 
notifications by contending that appellant has failed to pinpoint any 
illegality or legal infirmity therein, thus, no interference is 
warranted.  
 
At this stage, learned counsel for appellant states that in case 
instant appeal is allowed, appellant will not raise any demand for 
refund of fee, if any received by the respondent-department.  
5. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused. 
6. 
Sections 3 & 6 of the Ordinance of 1984 deal with the 
procedure for registration of an institution. It would be 
advantageous to reproduce the aforesaid provisions of law, which 
are as under:- 
“3. All institutions to be registered.– (1) An Incharge 
shall, before the commencement of business by the 
institution, register the institution with the Registering 
Authority under this Ordinance. 
(2)     The Registering Authority shall, within sixty days 
from the date of filing of an application for registration, 
decide the application. 
(3)  Until the application for registration is decided, the 
institution may continue to function without registration.” 
 
“6. Application for registration. - (1) The incharge of an 
institution may make an application for registration of an 
institution to such officer and in such form as may be 
prescribed. 
(2) The Officer receiving an application shall forthwith 
forward the same to the District Committee which, after 
making such inquiry about such matters as may be 
prescribed, 
shall 
submit 
its 
report 
with 
its 
recommendations to the Registering Authority within sixty 
days of the receipt of the application under subsection (1). 
(3) The Registering Authority shall, after considering the 
report of the District Committee and after such further 
enquiry as may be necessary if satisfied that the 
conditions prescribed for granting registration are fulfilled, 
issue a Registration Certificate. 
(4) No order for refusing to grant a certificate of 
registration shall be made without giving the applicant an 

 
 
ICA No.1379 of 2023 
 
4
opportunity of being heard and without recording reasons 
therefor. 
(5) The Government shall, by notification, constitute one 
or more Registering Authorities in a district and if more 
than a Registering Authority is constituted in a district, the 
Government shall specify the jurisdiction of each 
Registering Authority.” 
 
7. 
From perusal of above provisions, we observe that no 
specific duration for the validity of the registration is stipulated 
therein. Furthermore, the impugned notifications do not cite any 
governing laws or rules that grant the respondent-authority the 
power to establish a fixed period for the validity of such 
registration.  
8. 
Rule 5 of the Rules of 1984 provides a chart of registration 
fee for institutions, and reads as under:- 
5.  
Fees for Registration of Institution. The registration fees for 
institutions shall be as follows:-  
a) Degree and Inter Colleges   
 
 
 
Rs. 1,000  
b) Technical Commercial, Vocational Institutions  
 
Rs. 1,000 
c)  Educational Institutions for the handicapped High schools Rs. 100  
d) High Schools  
 
 
 
 
 
Rs. 500  
e) Pre-Primary, Primary and Middle Schools   
 
Rs. 100 
 
Through the impugned notifications, Respondent No. 2 has 
attempted to amend the aforementioned Rule. The Rules of 1984 
were framed under the authority of Section 13 of the Ordinance of 
1984, which empowers the Government to make rules to carry out 
the purposes of the Ordinance. However, we have noticed that no 
provision of applicable law or rules has been cited to show from 
where Respondent No. 2 derived the authority to issue the 
impugned notifications. These notifications appear to have been 
issued in a legal vacuum, beyond the scope of both the provisions 
of the Ordinance and the Rules of 1984. It is well-established law 
that no executive authority can take action without the backing of a 
valid law. Otherwise, such action would be void and liable to be 

 
 
ICA No.1379 of 2023 
 
5
struck down. It is also settled law that an Act or Statute (in this 
case, the Ordinance of 1984 and the rules framed under it) cannot 
be amended through a notification or subordinate enactment. 
Therefore, the provisions referred to above remain operative and in 
effect until they are repealed by proper legislation. Reference can 
be made to Shaukat Mahmood v. Election Commission of Pakistan 
(ECP) through Secretary ECP, Islamabad and others (PLD 2024 
Supreme Court 653), Roohullah and 6 others v. Government of 
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Secretary Environnment, Fisheries 
Department and 6 others (2016 CLC Note 47), Pakistan Medical 
Commission v. Province of Sindh and others (2024 CLC 53), 
Bayazid Khan Kharoti v. Chief Secretary Government of 
Balochistan Civil Secretariat, Zarghoon Road, Quetta and 2 
others [2024 P L C (C.S.) 246] and Province of Punjab through 
Director General Excise, Taxation and Narcotics Control 
Department Punjab and 2 others (2023 MLD 1245).   
9. 
In view of the above, this appeal is allowed in the manner 
that impugned judgment is set aside and impugned Notifications are 
declared to be illegal and without lawful authority. However, the 
appellant shall not claim refund of the already paid fee as per 
undertaking given before us, duly noted in Para 4 supra.
