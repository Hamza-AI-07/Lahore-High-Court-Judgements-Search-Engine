MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This petition in terms of Section 
115 of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) (hereinafter referred 
to as “CPC”) arises out of order dated 2nd April, 2024, whereby 
learned Civil Judge Class-I, Rawalpindi proceeded to consolidate 
two petitions titled “M/s ASR Builders versus Dr. Sardar 
Muhammad Kaleem Ullah, etc.” and “7 Sky Builders Vs M/s ASR 
Builders etc.” and framed consolidated issues, arising therefrom. 
2.  
 Facts in brevity, necessary for adjudication of instant petition, 
are that the petitioner filed a petition under Section 14 read with 
Section 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 (hereinafter referred to as 
“Act, 1940”) seeking a direction to respondent No.2, being the 
arbitrator to issue, sign and file arbitration award in the court so as 
the same be made rule of the court. The petition was resisted by

-2- 
 
respondent No.1 (hereinafter referred to as “respondent”) through 
written reply, who also filed a petition under Sections 5 and 11 of the 
“Act, 1940”. As the issue involved in both the petitions was with 
regard to the same cause so order for consolidation of the petitions 
was passed and consolidated issues were framed, which is now under 
challenge. 
3.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that “Act, 1940” 
does not permit consolidation of two petitions. He added that 
provisions of “CPC” are not stricto sensu applicable to the “Act, 
1940”. Learned counsel maintained that in terms of Section 33 of the 
“Act, 1940”, the civil court was obliged to decide the dispute on the 
basis of affidavit and as such the impugned order is not tenable. 
4.  
Conversely, learned counsel for the “respondent” seriously 
resisted this petition whereas respondent No.2 is on same page with 
the petitioner. 
5.  
Arguments heard, record perused. 
6.  
The petitioner and “respondent” entered into an agreement 
dated 15th February, 2020 for the construction/sale marketing of 
multi-storey building namely “IRENIC-II”. The “respondent” was 
responsible for the construction of the project whereas the petitioner 
had the exclusive rights of advertisement, marketing, sale, issuance 
of allotment letters and collection of funds. On account of dispute, 
the petitioner and “respondent” initially indulged in civil and 
criminal litigation, however, ultimately they agreed on settlement of 
their dispute through arbitration in furtherance of which, respondent 
No.2 was appointed as sole arbitrator to whom the matter was 
referred. As respondent No.2 failed to issue the arbitration award, the 
petitioner filed a petition under Section 14 read with Section 17 of 
the “Act, 1940”, in response to which, the “respondent” also filed a 
petition under Section 5 read with Section 11 of the “Act, 1940”. 
Through the impugned order, both the petitions were consolidated 
and as a result, consolidated issues were framed.

7.  
Before adverting to the moot point involved in this petition, it 
would be advantageous to first have glimpse of the historic 
background of the arbitration laws in Pakistan. It would not be out of 
context to mention here that before independence, there was no 
specific law on resolution of the disputes through arbitration and it 
was only invented in the first instance in British Rules through Indian 
Arbitration Act 1899. In the year 1940, for the first time, 
comprehensive and uniform law on the subject was introduced in the 
shape of “Act, 1940” by virtue of which, the previous law i.e. the 
Indian Arbitration Act, 1899 was repealed alongwith second 
schedule of the “CPC”. The purpose of the “Act, 1940” was to 
provide a domestic tribunal for settlement of disputes by and between 
the parties and provide expeditious relief strictly unhampered by the 
rules or procedure laid down in the “CPC” and The Evidence Act, 
1872, which is now Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984. The arbitration 
procedures are in fact consolatory in nature and the arbitrator is a 
person in whom the parties repose their confidence. In other words, 
the arbitration is one of alternate modes of resolution of the disputes 
interse the parties.   
8.  
There is no cavil that in terms of Section 33 of the “Act, 1940” 
any party to an arbitration agreement desiring to challenge the 
existence or validity of an arbitration agreement or an award or to 
have the effect of either determined may apply to the court and the 
court shall decide the question on affidavit. The proviso to Section 
33 of the “Act, 1940”, however, ordains that where the court deems 
it just and expedient, it may set down the application for hearing and 
other evidence also, and it may pass such order for discovery and 
particulars as it may do in a suit. Section 41 of the “Act, 1940” 
provides procedure and powers of the court and in terms of 
Sub-Section (a) of Section 41 of the “Act, 1940”, the provisions of 
“CPC” are applicable to all the proceedings before the court under 
the “Act, 1940”. Needless to mention that the applicability of the 
provisions of “CPC” are not meant to hamper the arbitration 
proceedings but for ensuring the advancement of ends of justice.

9.  
After having the joint reading of the above two provisions, 
there remain no cavil to hold that the contention of learned counsel 
for the petitioner that under the “Act, 1940”, framing of issues is not 
permissible is thus highly ill-founded and misconceived in the 
circumstances. Even otherwise, it is apparent from the record that the 
petitioner itself moved an application under Order XIV, Rule 5 of 
“CPC” for framing of additional issue as such it is estopped by words 
and conduct. Since there is no specific impediment in the way of the 
court, proceeding under the “Act, 1940”, so consolidation of the 
petitions and framing of consolidated issues, through the impugned 
order, does not warrant to invoke revisional jurisdiction. Resultantly, 
this petition fails and is dismissed accordingly.
