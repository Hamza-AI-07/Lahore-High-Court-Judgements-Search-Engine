JUDGMENT. 
 
  
 
 
 
Mirza Viqas Rauf, J. This petition under Article 199 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (hereinafter referred 
to as “Constitution”) assails the vires of order dated 15th June, 2022 
passed by the Member (Judicial-IV), Board of Revenue, Punjab in a 
revision petition filed by the petitioners whereby he proceeded to dismiss 
the petition being devoid of force and merits. This petition was admitted for 
regular hearing by way of order dated 29th July, 2022, however, on 
previous date a question was framed with regard to the maintainability of 
this petition with the following observations: - 
“2. 
It appears that the constitutional petition is arising out 
of order dated 15th June, 2022 passed by the Member (Judicial-IV) 
Board of Revenue, Punjab Rawalpindi Camp on a revision arising 
from proceedings under the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1967. In terms 
of Section 8 of the Punjab Board of Revenue Act, 1957 remedy of 
review is available and apparently main petition is not maintainable. 
3. 
Office to list out this C.M alongwith main petition on 
13.12.2023. On the said date the respondents/ writ petitioners shall

assist the Court with regard to maintainability of the petition with no 
further adjournment.” 
2.  
Learned counsel for the petitioners, while addressing the 
question of maintainability, submitted that remedy of review is not 
efficacious in the circumstances. He added that even otherwise, the scope 
of review is always limited. Learned counsel contended that constitution 
petition, in the circumstances is thus, maintainable. 
3.  
Conversely, learned counsel representing the respondent No.1 
as well as learned Law Officer seriously resisted the maintainability of this 
petition. 
4.  
Heard. Record perused. 
5.  
It evinces from the record that respondent No.1 moved an 
application under section 135 of the Punjab Land Revenue Act, 1967 
(hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1967”) before Tehsildar/AC-I, Chakwal 
seeking partition of the joint land forming part of Khasra Nos.930 and 932 
situated in village Minwal, Tehsil & District Chakwal. After passing 
through various phases, the application for partition was finally accepted 
on 12th December, 2020. Feeling dissatisfied, predecessor-in-interest of the 
petitioners namely Amir Hussain Shah preferred two appeals under section 
161 of the “Act, 1967” before the District Collector, Chakwal, which were 
dismissed on 31st March, 2021. The order was then challenged in revision 
petitions before the Additional Commissioner (Consolidation), Rawalpindi 
Division but the revisions were also dismissed vide order dated 14th 
October, 2021. The petitioners then challenged the said order through 
revision petition under section 164 of the “Act, 1967” before the Board of 
Revenue, Punjab wherein the impugned order was passed. It is, thus, 
evident that the impugned order arises out of proceedings conducted by the 
revenue hierarchy under the “Act, 1967”.  
6.  
In order to provide for constitution of Board of Revenue, the 
Punjab Board of Revenue Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 
1957”) was promulgated. The Board of Revenue was constituted in terms 
of section 3 of the “Act, 1957”, which was given the general 

3 
 
 
 
W.P.No.2154 of 2022 
 
 
 
superintendence and control over all Revenue Officers and Revenue 
Courts. Section 5 of the “Act, 1957” vests certain powers upon the Board, 
which reads as under: - 
5.   Powers of the Board.– (1) The Board shall be the controlling 
authority in all matters connected with the administration of land, 
collection of land revenue, preparation of land records and other 
matters relating thereto. 
      (2)  The Board shall be the highest court of appeal and 
revision in revenue cases in the Province. 
      (3)  All proceedings relating to any of the matters referred to in 
sub-sections (1) and (2) which immediately before the date of 
coming into force of this Act, were pending before the final 
appellate or revisional authority of any Province, State or other 
territory or area which has been included in the Province of 
Punjab, shall stand transferred to the Board. 
 7.  
Section 8 of the “Act, 1957” bestows power of review upon the 
Board. For ready reference and convenience, same is reproduced below: - 
8.   Review of orders by the Board.– (1) Any person considering 
himself aggrieved by a decree passed or order made by the Board 
and who, from the discovery of new and important matters or 
evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within 
his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when 
the decree was passed or the order was made, or on account of 
some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record or for 
any other sufficient reason desires to obtain a review of the decree 
passed or order made against him, may apply to the Board for a 
review of judgment and the Board may, after giving notice to the 
parties affected thereby and after hearing them, pass such decree 
or order as the circumstances of the case require. 
      (2)  Every application for a review of a decree or order under sub-
section (1) shall be made within ninety days from the date of that 
decree or order. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Underlining supplied for emphasis) 
It would not be out of place to mention here that the words “or for any 
other sufficient reason” were inserted by Act XVIII of 1964, which 
apparently was added to extend the scope of review by the Board. 
8.  
Article 199 of the “Constitution” though bestows power upon 
this Court to issue different kinds of writs mentioned therein but powers so 
ordained are not unbridled as is evident from the bare perusal of Article 
199 of the “Constitution”, which starts with a precondition in the following 
form: - 

4 
 
 
 
W.P.No.2154 of 2022 
 
 
 
199. Jurisdiction of High Court. (1) Subject to the 
Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other 
adequate remedy is provided by law- 
(a) 
on the application of any aggrieved party, make 
an order — 
(i) 
directing a person performing, within the 
territorial jurisdiction of the Court, functions in 
connection with the affairs of the Federation, a 
Province or a local authority, to refrain from doing 
anything he is not permitted by law to do, or to do 
anything he is required by law to do; or 
(ii) 
declaring that any act done or proceeding taken 
within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court by a 
person performing functions in connection with the 
affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local 
authority has been done or taken without lawful 
authority and is of no legal effect; or 
(b) 
on the application of any person, make an 
order— 
(i) 
directing that a person in custody within the 
territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it 
so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being 
held in custody without lawful authority or in an 
unlawful manner; or 
(ii) 
requiring a person within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the Court holding or purporting to hold a 
public office to show under what authority of law he 
claims to hold that office; or 
(c) 
on the application of any aggrieved person, 
make an order giving such directions to any person or 
authority, including any Government exercising any 
power or performing any function in, or in relation to, 
any territory within the jurisdiction of that Court as may 
be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the 
Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II. 
(underlining supplied for emphasis) 
9.  
There is no cavil to the proposition that despite availability of 
alternate remedy, this Court is not precluded to exercise its jurisdiction as 
a rule of thumb and even in case of availability of alternate remedy, if the 
circumstances so demand that the exercise of constitutional jurisdiction is 
inevitable, a High Court can invoke the jurisdiction under Article 199 of 
the “Constitution” but at the same time, such exercise cannot be made in 
an omnibus fashion. It is an oft repeated principle of law that where any 

5 
 
 
 
W.P.No.2154 of 2022 
 
 
 
party opts to choose a statutory remedy against an order, it cannot 
abandon or bypass it without any valid or reasonable cause and file 
constitution petition challenging such order. Such a trend is even offensive 
of doctrine of election. Guidance in this respect can be sought from 
COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, COMPANIES-II and another v. 
HAMDARD DAWAKHANA (WAQF), KARACHI (PLD 1992 Supreme 
Court 847). The relevant extract from the same is reproduced below: - 
“12. Before parting with the judgment we may 
observe that in cases where any party resorts to a statutory 
remedy against an order he cannot abandon or bypass it 
without any valid and reasonable cause and file Constitution 
petition challenging the same order. Such practice, in cases 
where statute provides alternate and efficacious remedy upto 
High Court, cannot be approved or encouraged. In a recent 
judgment of this Court in CA. No.79-K of 1991, one of us 
(Ajmal Mian, J.) in similar situation observed as follows: 
"We may now revert to the question, whether the 
appellant was justified to file above Constitution 
petition against the order of the Tribunal instead 
of invoking section 136 of the Ordinance for 
making a reference to the High Court. According 
to Mr. Rehan Naqvi, a reference under the above 
provision would not have been adequate and 
efficacious remedy as it would have taken years 
before it could have been heard. The same could 
be true for a Constitution Petition.  
The tendency to bypass the remedy provided under 
the relevant statute and to press into service 
Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court has 
developed lately, which is to be discouraged. 
However, 
in 
certain 
cases 
invoking 
of 
Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court 
instead of availing of remedy provided for under 
the relevant statute may be justified, for example 
when the impugned order/action is palpably 
without jurisdiction and/or mala fide. To force an 
aggrieved person in such a case to approach the 
forum provided under the relevant statute may not 
be just and proper. 
In the present case, the appellant had opted to 
avail of the hierarchy of forums provided for 
under the Ordinance upto the stage of filing of 
appeal before the Tribunal and, therefore, it would 
have been proper on the part of the appellant to 
have invoked section 136 of the Ordinance for 
making a reference to the High Court instead of 
filing a Constitutional petition. In our view, once a 
party opts to invoke the remedies provided for 

6 
 
 
 
W.P.No.2154 of 2022 
 
 
 
under the relevant statute, he cannot at his sweet 
will switch over to Constitutional jurisdiction of 
the High Court in the mid of the proceeding in the 
absence of any compelling and justifiable reason." 
Reference can also be made to TRADING CORPORATION OF PAKISTAN 
versus DEVAN SUGAR MILLS LIMITED and others (PLD 2018 Supreme 
Court 828). 
10.  
 For the foregoing reasons, this petition is not maintainable. 
Resultantly, the same is dismissed with no order as to costs.
