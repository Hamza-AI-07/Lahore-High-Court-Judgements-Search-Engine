Shahid Karim, J:- This litigation engages the 
questions of intergenerational and climate justice.  
The Govt. of the Punjab notified Gujrat as the 10th 
Division of the Punjab.  The administrative purview 
of Gujrat Division encompasses four districts, that is, 
Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and Hafizabad.  
It is the case of the Govt. of the Punjab that in order 
to cater to the operational and administrative 
requirements of the newly notified Division, a 
purpose-built Divisional Complex to host Divisional 
Headquarters in Gujrat is required including offices 
and residences of the Divisional Administration, 
police etc. as well as Divisional offices of other 
related administrative departments (“the Project”).  

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
2
For the purpose, the scheme titled „Construction of 
Divisional Complex at Gujrat (Phase-I) was 
principally approved by PDWP in its meeting held 
on 30.09.2022 with a total cost of Rs.8.805 billion 
and accordingly the administrative approval was 
given by the Board of Revenue, Govt. of the Punjab 
on 18.10.2022 with IDAP as the executing agency of 
the project.  The site situated at Mauza Machhiana 
and Samman Pindi was selected for the construction 
of the Project.  State land earmarked for this purpose 
comprised of two forest areas measuring 594-Kanals 
4-Marlas (Khasra No.2431 of Mouza Machhiana) 
and 107-Kanals 19-Marlas (Khasra No.2225 of 
Mouza Machhiana) respectively.  These forest areas 
are property of Government of Punjab through 
irrigation department and is being maintained by the 
forest and wildlife department.   
2. 
Through Notification under Section 4 of the 
Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (“the Act, 1894”) dated 
10.10.2022, issued by District Collector, Gujrat 
(impugned Notification) acquisition proceedings 
have been set in motion regarding private land 
measuring 184K-OM.  This has been challenged in 
W.P.No.6063 of 2023 by the landowners.  Both 
petitions are being decided by this common 
judgment. 
3. 
Detailed replies were filed by the respondents.  
The Chief Secretary Punjab was required to file a 
report under his signatures which has been done and 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022

which alludes to the various aspects of the Project 
and finally concludes that the concerns of the 
petitioners are unrealistic as “drainage passage has 
been provided to cater to the disposal of rain 
water and forest regeneration activities will be 
carried out for environmental sustainability.  
Needless to say, the construction of Divisional 
Complex is not only imperative for service 
delivery improvement of the newly created offices 
at Divisional level but also to facilitate the general 
public in the Division.”  The report further states 
that “maximum effort will be made by the 
administrative department to protect the tree 
cover and trees will only be removed upon 
absolute necessity for the execution of the 
development work”.  With regard to the expansive 
tree cover/ forest on the area proposed to be taken 
over for the scheme, the Chief Secretary Punjab 
reported that “to ascertain the protection of tree 
cover and forest regeneration efforts in the area, 
the 
Committee 
constituted 
by 
the 
Forest 
Department would also prepare a replenishment 
plan for the project area.  Forest Department has 
already finalized the replenishment cost of Rs.124 
Million.”  Thus, in the opinion of the Chief Secretary 
Punjab, replenishment plan for the project area was 
sufficient compliance and would take care of the 
concerns raised by the petitioners regarding the 
forest cover on the entire land which is sought to be 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022

acquired for the purpose of project.  This statement 
by the Chief Secretary Punjab is in tune with the one 
submitted by respondent No.5 which is the Secretary 
Department 
of 
Forest 
and 
Wildlife 
Punjab.  
Respondent No.5 while referring to the basic facts in 
respect of the project area and its current nature, 
stated that: 
“That the area along Upper Jhelum Canal at 
Machiana is the property of Punjab Irrigation 
Department but is maintained & planted by the 
Forest Department.  Furthermore, (Eucalyptus, 
Kikar & Willow were planted in an area of 100 AV 
Miles/ 160 AV/KM (Pole crop) along Upper Jhelum 
Canal (UJC RD No.390-396) in 2009-10 under the 
Scheme afforestation on Blank Reaches along 
Canals in Gujrat Forest Division, Gujrat.” 
 
4. 
Thus, it is admitted on all hands and more 
particularly 
by 
the 
concerned 
administrative 
department and by its Secretary that the area is along 
Upper Jhelum Canal and has extensively been 
planted by the Forest Department.  Different species 
of trees have been referred in the portion set out 
above in an area of 100 AV Miles/ 160 AV/KM 
along Upper Jhelum Canal (UJC) during the year 
2009-10.  These are now fully grown-up and mature 
trees.  In the year 2022, the Assistant Commissioner/ 
Land Acquisition Collector, Gujrat vide letter dated  
25.10.2022 requested the Divisional Forest Officer 
Gujrat to provide the demand notice / cost estimation 
of buildings, crops and trees as mentioned in the 
Notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition 
Act, 1894 to remit replenishment cost as well as 
compensation/ value involving pole crops/ plants 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
5
hindering in acquisition proceedings and for the 
grant of NOC for the construction of Commissioner/ 
Divisional Complex Gujrat.  In the same vein, the 
Secretary in the reply referred to the importance of 
protected forests and their role in environmental 
sustainability in the following words: 
“Protected Forests are important to maintain and 
enhance biodiversity as well as to conserve 
landscapes and provide recreation opportunities, 
these are either demarcated or un-demarcated, 
based on whether the limits of the forest have been 
specified by a formal notification.  A protected 
forest is land notified under the provisions of the 
Forest Act, 1927.  In protected forests, all activities 
are permitted unless they are expressly prohibited.  
A protected forest is land that is a reserved forest, 
and over which the government has proprietary 
rights, as declared by a government under section 
29 of the Forest Act, 1927…” 
 
5. 
In the final analysis it was concluded by the 
Secretary Department of Forest and Wildlife that 
there is no apprehension of serious implications on 
the flood mitigation for the area because as per 
approved plan of outfall channel of Machiana 
Siphon, there are 141 different types of hydraulic 
structures on UJC and Machiana Siphon.  The 
purpose for which the Siphon is built was also given 
in paragraph 4 of the reply filed by respondent No.5. 
6. 
In furtherance of the above, the Addl. Chief 
Secretary Irrigation Department appeared before this 
Court and submitted a report dated 10.02.2023 which 
is based on the report regarding transfer of land 
required for the construction of the project along 
Upper Jhelum Canal and prepared by the Chief 
Engineer Irrigation Pothohar Zone Rawalpindi/ 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
6
Islamabad.  It has been mentioned in the report that 
an NOC was issued by the Department which was 
conditional upon exclusion of the area comprising 
292 Kanal for the purpose of flood channel.  The 
report goes on to state that: 
“3. 
Accordingly, a meeting was convened with 
Chief Potohar Zone along with his field staff 
relevant to the concerned area wherein, findings of 
the Report submitted by the commission as referred 
at para 1 were deliberated. Chief Potohar Zone, 
while contending that NOC issued by the 
Department was conditional upon exclusion of the 
area comprising of 292-K for the purpose of flood 
channel, shared his report contents of which are 
reproduced as under (Annex F): 
The land in question is situated at right bank of 
Upper Jhelm Canal (UJC) at RD 393+250 
(Machiana Siphon). Upper Jhelum Canal off takes 
from Mangla Dam with design discharge of 8975 
Cusec at its head. It was constructed during 1904 to 
1915 to provide irrigation supplies to AJK, Districts 
Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin and Sargodha. There are 
141 different types of hydraulic structures on UJC 
and Machiana Siphon at RD. 393+250 UJC, is one 
of them. It was constructed to drain off rain water 
of Pubbi hills/adjoining catchment area and spill 
over water of Nullah Bhimber with discharge 
capacity of approximately 8500 Cusec. It has 6 
number of barrels and each barrel having width of 
12 feet. Given the fact that that the entire structure 
was built over a century ago, surrounding areas 
came under cultivation and urbanized in the past 
and to control spill water of Nullah Bhimber, flood 
protection 
bunds 
were 
constructed 
by 
this 
Department on both sides of Nullah, resulting in 
reduced water supply from  catchment area. Visit of 
the existing structure and the surrounding area 
showed that due to continuous low flows barrels are 
silted up and choked. Furthermore, outfall channel 
of Machiana syphon which is passing through land 
proposed for the construction of Divisional 
Complex is heavily silted up and its bed level is at 
Natural Surface Level (N.S.L). Furthermore, 
Forest Department has carried out plantation 
during 2009-2010 under scheme afforestation on 
banks reaches alongwith canal by Gujrat Forest 
Division Gujrat. The aforesaid plantation was 
done on the land in question. It is pertinent to 
mention that, as per approved design of outfall 
channel of Machiana syphon, initial width of 
outfall channel is 150 ft and tail 350 ft in width 
with 20 ft width of both banks. Area under outfall 
channel is 292-K out of total area of 704-K 03-M. 
The remaining area comprising of 412-K 03-M in 
Khasra No.2225 and 2431 was, therefore, 
considered surplus as per the due diligence 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
7
conducted by the field staff keeping in view design 
parameters and history of past floods in the last 
decade, while issuing the conditional NOC. For a 
more accurate assessment, a detailed study may be 
conducted if deemed necessary.” 
 
7. 
The above report gives a much more explicit 
depiction of the land which is proposed to be 
acquired for setting up the Project.  As explicated 
above, the report alludes to the fact that there are 141 
different types of hydraulic structures at UJC (Upper 
Jhelum Canal) and Machiana Siphon is one of them.  
It was constructed to drain off rain water of Pubbi 
hills and adjoining catchment area and spill over 
water of Nullah Bhimber with discharge capacity of 
approximately 8500 Cusec.  Further the outfall 
channel of Machiana Siphon which is passing 
through the land proposed for the construction of 
Divisional Complex is heavily silted up and its bed 
level is at Natural Surface Level (NSL). It also refers 
to the plantation under the scheme afforestation on 
banks reaches along canal by Gujrat Forest Division 
Gujrat.  The total land to be acquired for the purpose 
and which belongs to Irrigation and Forest 
Department comprises an area of 704 Kanal and 3 
Marlas.  More importantly, the report clearly stated 
that a more accurate assessment was required and for 
which a detailed study may be conducted. 
8. 
We now come to the report filed by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It makes it 
mandatory for any project to be commenced and 
constructed by submission of IEE or EIA for 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
8
obtaining environmental approval prior to its 
commencement.  This is the requirement of section 
12 of the Punjab Environmental Protection Act, 1997 
which obliges the proponent of project to do so.  This 
has not been done by the proponent in the instant 
case and this fact is also admitted by all the 
respondents in this case and more particularly in the 
report submitted by the Chief Secretary Punjab who 
has stated that “the project will be executed on the 
basis of recommendations discerned in the 
pertinent studies to minimize the environmental, 
geo-technical and drainage / seepage / flood 
impacts.”  Further that “execution of the project 
will be commenced after finalization of detailed 
design of the Complex in the light of the 
environmental and other relevant assessment 
studies of the site.”  The report also attaches a letter 
dated 20.12.2022 written to the Govt. of the Punjab, 
S&GAD Lahore by the Environmental Protection 
Department, Govt. of the Punjab which categorically 
states that the scheme falls in Schedule-I of the 
Review of IEE/EIA Regulations 2000 and hence the 
project proponent is supposed to submit IEE report to 
obtain environmental approval as required under 
Section 12 of the Act, 1997.  Thus, these petitions 
could receive a short shrift and be allowed on the 
simple and short question that the approval under 
Section 12 of the Act, 1997 has not been given by 
EPA to the Project.  The proponent has not submitted 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
9
IEE/ EIA which is a sine qua non and no project can 
be initiated or commenced for construction unless a 
prior approval has been granted by EPA under the 
law.  The mandate of section 12 is clear and cannot 
be undermined by any proponent of a project.  It 
states that neither the project shall be constructed nor 
commence operation unless an EIA has been 
prepared and submitted to the provincial agency 
where the project is likely to cause an adverse 
environmental effect, an environmental impact 
assessment and an approval has to be obtained from 
the provincial agency.  The term „operation‟ used in 
section 12 is wide enough to include the acquisition 
process for, any approval by the provincial agency 
must be placed before the Collector in order to 
enable the Collector to form an opinion that a land in 
a locality is needed for a public purpose.  It may be 
that the approval is withheld by the provincial 
agency underlying a certain project or it may impose 
conditions which should be fulfilled prior to 
commencing, construction and operation of the 
project.  Unless mitigatory and compensatory 
measures in respect of a certain project have been 
taken by the proponent, there is no cause for 
acquisition to be made and for the persons to be 
deprived of their proprietary rights.   
9. 
The Notifications as well as NOCs issued for 
the project are liable to be struck down and declared 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
10
ultra vires on account of failure to submit IEE by the 
proponent of the project to the provincial agency. 
10. Notwithstanding the above, it is imperative to 
proceed to discuss the strands of issues of far 
reaching impact on the environmental aspect which 
the proposed project is likely to generate in view of 
the suggestions by proponent of the project to 
acquire land which includes precious land of 
standing crops and grown up trees.  In order to 
ascertain the true facts and to have a non-partisan 
and independent view on the ground, a Commission 
was constituted by this Court to visit the project area 
and to file a report.  The Commission constituted the 
following eminent persons: 
1. 
Dr. Masood Arshd, Senior Director, WWF. 
2. 
Ali Hassan Habib, IGC (International 
Grown Centre)/ Managing Director Himareate. 
3. 
Ms. Hina Hafeezullah Ishaq, Advocate. 
4. 
Syed Kamal Ali Haider, Advocate. 
 
11. The Commission filed its report on 27.1.2013 
and in the section relating to summary, the following 
statement was set out: 
 
1.0 Summary 
The Lahore High Court Commission members 
visited the disputed site on 12 December 2022, met 
with the local government representatives and with 
the representatives of the petition applicants and 
affected villagers.  
This Commission concluded that the Machianna 
Siphon area of 702 Kanals is a critical flood 
mitigation facility that has prevented loss and 
damage to the Upper Jhelum Canal and 17 
upstream villages, which therefore needs to 
remain intact and undisturbed. The existing tree 
plantation further enhances the protective flood 
mitigation function and therefore should remain 
intact without infringement or cutting. 
 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
11
12. The report thereafter stated that the area of 702 
Kanal is under the legal ownership of Punjab 
Irrigation Department and contains Machiana Siphon 
designed for 8500 cusec for flash flood mitigation 
and protection for Upper Jhelum Canal and upstream 
urban areas.  More importantly, the representative of 
the Punjab Irrigation Department clearly stated that 
the department does not agree to handing over the 
whole area of land for the construction of the Project 
since it includes critical flood mitigation area of 290 
Kanal. 
 
The 
representative 
of 
the 
Punjab 
Environmental Protection Department reiterated that 
Initial Environment Examination (IEE) before design 
and construction of the project is essential which 
approval has not been obtained for the project.  The 
officers representing the Punjab Forest Department 
made the following statement: 
3.4Punjab Forest Department was represented by 
Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) and newly posted 
Conservator Forest (CF). Both the officers 
explained that it is not a protected forest, but this 
area is part of the floodplains. The plant species 
include 
90% 
of 
Eucalyptus 
(Eucalyptus 
Camaldulensis) trees on 702 Kanals of land, 
whereas the other species include Shisham 
(Dalbergia sissoo) and Willow (Salix spp.) 
 
13. According to the above statement, although the 
area is not a protected forest but is part of the 
floodplains.  All 702 Kanal land has been planted 
with trees of different species mentioned above and 
which are grown up over the years and are mature 
trees.  The Members of the Commission made visual 
observations regarding mature trees on 702 Kanal of 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
12
land, ponds, wet lands, Marshy areas which were 
visible in the forest area and which is the true 
representation of a forest/ wetland ecosystem and 
helps mitigate flash floods.  The entire population of 
the adjoining villages was against the proposed 
project.  It has further been stated in the report that 
the surrounding area is a fertile land for multi- 
purpose cropping which ensures food security for the 
local population.  Finally, the Commission made the 
following conclusions and recommendations: 
6.0 Conclusion and Recommendations  
6.1. The Commission strongly recommends that 
this site is not feasible for the construction of 
Gujrat Divisional Headquarters.  
6.2. This 702 kanals of land is a critical 
infrastructure for mitigating the impacts of flash 
flood in the region.  
6.3. District Administration, while planning for 
this project ignored the provision of the following 
Acts, Policies and Regulations: 
. Punjab Floodplain Regulation Act 2016. 
. Clause 6 Environmental Integrity of basin, 
Clause 20, 20.1 Water related hazards under the 
National Water Policy. 
.Punjab Forest Policy 2019 
.Clauses 4.7, 5.4 and 6 “Disaster Preparedness, 
Urban Planning & Waste Management, Capacity 
building & Institutional strengthening” under the 
national climate change policy.  
. Punjab Forest Policy 2019 
6.4. Considering the unpredictability of the 
climatic extreme events due to climate change, the 
precautionary measures must be followed to 
maintain this flood mitigation syphon.  
6.5. Gujrat Divisional Headquarters should be a 
green and smart building which can be a 
multistory within the Gujrat Urban Area. It should 
be model green and smart building following 
principles of climate resilience structures. 
6.6. The Green Building Council of Pakistan 
should provide the technical assistance for this 
project.  
6.7. Landuse figures of the District Gujrat, Tehsil 
Gujrat and Machianna Village are attached as 
figure 1, 2 and 3 respectively for assessing the 
meager 
forest 
cover of the city and its 
surroundings in addition to the land use of the 
area.  
6.8. At the UN COP-27 Conference in November 
2022,  Pakistan led the discussion on loss and 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
13
damage due to floods. In this context, it would 
create 
international 
embarrassment 
to 
the 
government of Pakistan if the largest provincial 
government itself compromises any existing flood 
mitigation facilities.  
6.9. The commission further recommends that the 
irrigation Department provide the honourable 
Lahore High Court a list of all the flood 
management facilities and infrastructure in Gujrat 
District 
and 
Punjab 
and 
point 
out 
any 
encroachments 
of 
shortcomings 
in 
these 
considering the critical importance of flood 
management in the coming year due to Climate 
Change. The 2010 Lahore High Court Flood 
Tribunal report should be consulted for this 
purpose. 
 
14. According to the recommendations of the 
Commission, the site was not feasible for the 
construction of Gujrat Divisional Headquarters and 
the area of 702 Kanal of land is a critical 
infrastructure for mitigating the impact of flash 
floods in the region.  The Commission commented 
that 
the 
District 
Administration 
ignored 
the 
provisions of various statutes and laws as also 
policies and regulations formulated over the years to 
which a reference has been made in the conclusion 
drawn by the Commission.    No objections were 
filed to the Commission‟s Report. 
15. To reiterate, in the view of the Members of the 
Commission, the Project was not feasible to be 
constructed at the site which has been proposed by 
the proponent department of the Govt. of the Punjab.  
Critically the land on which the project site has been 
proposed comprises of 702 Kanal of precious 
agricultural and forest land and which ought to be 
protected under all circumstances.  Unless the 
measure is absolutely necessary in the national 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
14
interest which takes priority over all other interests 
no agricultural land and forest land can be acquired 
for the purpose of setting up of any infrastructure 
project.  In this case, the respondents have not put 
forth any compelling reasons for acquisition of the 
land in question and have also not come up with a 
host of conditions which would justify the 
acquisition of the land in question.  Clearly, the 
respondents would have alternate proposals for the 
setting up of Divisional Headquarter Complex on a 
land which does not require the acquisition of 
pristine agricultural and forest land.  It would be an 
egregious act of insensibility to cut down mature 
trees on land consisting over 702 Kanal and which is 
also a critical flood mitigation facility that has been 
preserved to prevent loss and damage to Upper 
Jhelum Canal and 17 upstream villages and therefore 
needs to remain intact and untempered.   
16. In a recent judgment rendered by this Court in 
W.P.No9429 of 2021 titled „Public Interest Law 
Association of Pakistan v. Environmental Protection 
Agency Punjab through Director General and others, 
the various provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 
1894 have been read down in such a manner that no 
acquisition of agricultural and cultivable farmlands 
can be done on the basis that it offends Articles 9 and 
14 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973.  The relevant extracts of that 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
15
judgment would shed further light on the proposition 
and are set out below: 
“139.  Based upon the above report which has gone  
unrebutted, the food security situation and the 
issues confronting Pakistan paint a dismal picture 
as can be seen from the facts explicated above. 
Pakistan ranks 80 out of 113 countries on the 
global food security index and food safety  score of  
43.5 which is below  average score of 60.4. This 
means simply that Pakistan has to take measures on 
an emergency basis to curtail the loss of 
agricultural and cultivated land in order to protect 
its food security paradigm.  Aaminah Qadir, 
Advocate alludes to similar facts in the bundle 
submitted by her. Pakistan has a level of  hunger  
that is categorized as ‗serious„ with a score of 24.7 
according to Global hunger Index. 44% of those 
under the age of 5 are stunted in Pakistan. In the 
case of  Ahmad  Pansota  v. Federation of Pakistan 
(PLD 2020 Lah. 229) a learned Single Judge of this 
Court observed that food insecurity exists when 
people lack secure access to sufficient amounts of 
safe and nutrition food for normal growth. The 
Court noted that this is caused by unavailability of 
food, insufficient purchasing power etc. Reference 
has also been made to several international treaties 
(ratified by Pakistan) that guarantee that all 
citizens will be provided with a basic standard of 
living that includes food.  The right to life under 
Article 9 has been invoked by the petitioners and 
supported by the  amici  curiae  to contend that 
acquisition of agricultural and cultivated farmland 
cannot be permitted to be continued without 
statutory framework which would encompass the 
entire set of circumstances under which such 
farmland can be acquired and which should also 
provide for alternatives and other options.  There is 
no doubt that such a statutory framework must  
underscore  the need for preservation and 
sustenance of agricultural and cultivated farmland. 
Only under dire circumstances can a piece of land 
which is under cultivation be acquired and in case 
it has to be done the statutory framework must 
provide for a proportionate area of land to be 
allocated and which may be brought under 
cultivation so that the balance of food security 
should not be disturbed.  Aaminah Qadir, Advocate 
cited two recent cases, one from the Lahore High 
Court and the other from the Sindh High Court 
which have taken note of these issues and have 
underscored the need for addressing the issue of 
food shortage resulting from a prime agricultural 
land.” 
 
143.  There is no doubt that changes need to be 
made in the Act, 1894 to cater for evolving socio-
economic imperatives as also to deal with 
environmental issues confronting Pakistan. The 
scheme of the Act, 1894 does not envisage a 
structure which would oblige the Collector of a 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
16
district to refuse the acquisition of an agricultural 
and cultivated farmland. No distinction has been 
made in the entire Act, 1894 for placing the 
agricultural land as a separate set of land to be 
treated differently from lands which are not under 
cultivation. As and when the government seeks to 
acquire land, the Collector of a district acts 
mechanically in proceeding to issue  a notification 
under Section 4 of the Act, 1894 and thereafter the 
proceedings  are  merely  restricted to  the 
determination of compensation and the steps 
leading towards that.  The officers under the Act, 
1894 are not empowered to draw a distinction on 
the basis of agricultural and non-agricultural lands 
and no discretion lies with such officers to refuse to 
acquire lands which in their opinion are under 
cultivation and are being used for agricultural 
purposes.  In short, the issues related to food 
security and the need to preserve agricultural land 
do not arise before the Collector of a district at any 
stage of the process of acquisition. Once the 
process starts, the entire focus is on determination 
of compensation to be disbursed to the persons 
whose lands  are under acquisition. There is a need 
for a paradigm shift in the entire system of 
acquisition related to agricultural and cultivated 
farmland. This cannot be achieved under the 
present dispensation of the Act, 1894. The Govt. of 
the Punjab will have to initiate legislation for the 
purposes of laying down an elaborate framework 
and a statutory regime will have to be put in place 
to deal with the issue of acquisition of agricultural 
land keeping in view the ground realities and the 
impact of acquisition  that such land will have on 
the socio-economic  and ecological  development of 
the Province. The matter cannot be left unattended 
anymore as we have crossed a threshold where we 
are threatened with looming food insecurity and 
which is likely to aggravate in  the coming years. 
This is not only a matter within the purview of 
Article 9 which ensures right to life but also is a 
matter of national security which is a concept which 
must be enlarged  to encompass not only armed  
conflicts and military defence  but also issues such 
as food insecurity and economic stability. Human 
security must be at the heart of any National 
Security Policy. 
 
“147.  Doubtless, the conversion of farmland to 
other uses presents  a real and present danger to 
food security, environment and social well-being. It 
is a problem that is wide-spread and afflicts not 
only Pakistan but has global footprint. 
 
148.  Thus, the Act, 1894 in its present form offends 
Article 9 of the Constitution, in that, it fails to deal 
with the issue of acquisition relating to agricultural 
and cultivated farmlands. It will have to be read 
down on this aspect.”

17. In the same judgment, the rules regarding 
acquisition of reserve forest land under the Forest 
Act, 1927 was referred and reliance was placed on 
various studies which concluded that 85% of the land 
in forest has vanished from the study area.  This 
study was carried out in the year 2014 and was 
conducted in the Lahore District area called 
„Modeling Land Use Patterns of Lahore‟.  As a 
result, this rapid urban extension has changed the 
land use profile of different districts from agriculture 
to urban.  Over the past few decades, the urban 
expansion has successfully modified the land use 
patterns of areas comprising the Province of Punjab 
and built up area has increased remarkably at the 
expanse of agricultural and forest land.  Although 
according to the reports filed by the departments, the 
area has not been declared either as a protected forest 
or reserve forest under the provisions of the Act, 
1927, this does not make any difference since the 
area qualifies to be treated as such and notifications 
ought to have been issued in this regard by the Forest 
Department.  This failure to do so will not detract 
from the fact that the area under acquisition is a 
reserve forest and cannot be put to any other use 
unless the provisions of section 27 of the Act, 1927 
are scrupulously followed. 
18. In a recent judgment of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan passed in C.A Nos.329 to 346 of 2022 (CA 
No.329 of 2022 Shah Zaman Khan v. Govt. of 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through its Chief Secretary, 
Peshawar and others) and arising out of a judgment 
of the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar, the issue 
which engaged the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
related to section 29 of the Act, 1927.  The challenge 
was laid to the Notification issued on 17.2.1976 
under Section 29 of the Forest Act, 1927.  The 
following observations by Qazi Faez Isa, J. are 
relevant for our purposes: 
“The Forest Ordinance was enacted, amongst other 
reasons, for the protection and conservation19 of 
forests in the Province and this was done in the 
public interest. Pakistan has been denuded of its 
forests and not nearly enough has been done to 
protect the remaining forests. An academic-
scientific report states that Pakistan lost 14.7% of 
its forest habitat between 1990 and 2005.20 And, 
from 2000 to 2020, Pakistan experienced a net 
change of 94.8 thousand hectares (4.5%) in tree 
cover.21 The importance of forests is by now well 
established. Forests are necessary to promote 
headwater conservation for the alleviation of floods 
and water shortages.22 Forests aid in the 
prevention of disasters and provide a stable supply 
of water (one tree can retain ground water up to 
30,000 liters23). Denuding land of forests and trees 
has catastrophic effects including avalanches, flash 
floods, silting up of rivers, lakes and dams, the 
accumulation of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) 
and climate change. Forests and trees remove 
carbon dioxide; over a one-year period a mature 
tree absorbs about 22 kilograms of carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere, and in exchange releases 
oxygen.24 The European Environmental Agency 
has determined that in a year, 1.3 million trees are 
estimated to remove more than 2,500 tons of 
pollutants from the air. 
 
20. The Forest Ordinance was also enacted to 
preserve ecological significance, 26 the integrity of 
the ecological system27 and to promote the 
understanding of environmental significance.28 
Reduction in forest and tree cover harms 
ecosystems and consequently the animals, birds and 
insects dependent on them, and results in the loss of 
biodiversity. The Forest Ordinance is a beneficial 
piece of legislation, but this important aspect was 
not considered by the High Court before it 
proceeded to negate the bar of jurisdiction 
provision (section 92 of the Forest Ordinance).

21. We must also not lose sight of a most startling 
fact. Pakistan is amongst a score of countries which 
are 
disproportionately 
vulnerable 
to 
the 
consequences of climate change.29 To ignore the 
reality of climate change is to be unjust and it 
disregards future generations. 
 
22. Climate change is not just a future threat but a 
present reality. The planet is in crisis and disasters 
are accelerating disasters. Climatic events of 
unprecedented severity are being witnessed. The 
unilateral and unsustainable pillage of the earth‟s 
resources has left humanity, and all other species, 
vulnerable. Excessive burning of fossil fuels has 
heated up the earth‟s temperature and when forests, 
which sequester carbon emissions are stripped 
away, its effect is compounded. Carbon fuel 
extraction needs to correlate with the available 
trees, plants and phytoplankton which store 
emissions. The causes of climate change and the 
catastrophic events that it unleashes are (by now) 
empirically established, yet the problem is not being 
addressed 
with 
the 
requisite 
urgency 
and 
seriousness. Simple mitigation measures are also 
not implemented. Carbon emissions, and not trees, 
have to be cut down. The learned Judges failed to 
consider that the Forest Ordinance was a beneficial 
piece of legislation which was enacted to conserve 
scarce remaining forests. 
 
23. The natural world is an epiphany yet the 
extraordinary bounty of nature and creation‟s 
perfect balance31 has been disrupted. The warning 
not to tamper with nature‟s balance is not 
heeded.32 Some view nature as an inert repository 
of resources to subdue, remove and deplete, and 
profiteering as their right. „As the land becomes 
impoverished so too does the scope of their vision‟. 
33 Reverence for the natural world has become 
peripheral. Humanity needs to regain its lost 
consciousness and its primordial link to nature.34 
Humans must assume their responsibility as trustees 
of the earth35 and of all of creation;36 and, not to 
be deaf and dumb, engulfed in darkness.37 The 
trees of the forest are sentient beings38 and, like 
human beings, part of the biotic community. In 
regaining their trusteeship humans also salvage 
their humanity, and save themselves and their 
progeny.” 
 
19. The observations set out above aptly apply to 
the facts of the present case and the respondents-
departments have failed to establish facts which 
would justify the setting up of the project on an area 
which comprises agricultural and forest land.  The 
respondents have no reasonable cause to change the 

W.P.No.76524 of 2022 
20
nature of forest land and carry out construction for 
setting up of a Divisional Headquarter.  It is also 
unjustified to cut trees which are standing on the 
forest area and to change the status of land used for 
flood mitigation in any manner.  The act of the 
respondents contravenes the holding of this Court in 
Public Interest Law Association of Pakistan as well 
as of Shah Zaman Khan by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan.  The impugned notifications issued under 
Section 4 of the Act, 1894 and the other acquisition 
proceedings in respect of disputed land are hereby 
declared without lawful authority and of no legal 
effect.  These are struck down.  Petitions allowed.
