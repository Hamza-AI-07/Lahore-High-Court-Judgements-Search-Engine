BRIEF FACTS OF THE CASE 
2. 
Pursuant to a letter issued by the Respondent No.4/Secretary, 
Ministry of Defence, Government of Pakistan (the “Ministry of 
Defence”), whereby recommendations were invited for the 
Pakistan Civil Awards-2022 (the “Award”), the Respondent No.5 
i.e. the Director General, Federal Government, Educational 
Stereo. HCJDA 38 

W.P.No.3542/2022 
 
 
 
  
       2 
Institutions (Cantt/Garrison) Directorate, Rawalpindi Cantt. (the 
“FGEI”),  vide letter dated 07.04.2022, forwarded name of the 
Petitioner alongwith five other recommendees to the Ministry of 
Defence for consideration at appropriate level and for further 
submission to the concerned authorities, but the Ministry of 
Defence forwarded a list of ten recommendees on the prescribed 
proforma to Respondent No.1 i.e. the Secretary, Cabinet Division, 
Islamabad (the “Cabinet Division”), through office memorandum 
dated 06.07.2022, without including name of the Petitioner and 
other persons recommended by the Director General/Federal 
Government, hence, this petition for non-consideration of name of 
the Petitioner for conferment of the Award by Respondent 
No.3/Main Awards Committee (the “Committee”). 
II.   PETITIONER’S SUBMISSIONS 
3. 
The Petitioner, while pleading his case, submitted that he 
rendered services for the Government of Pakistan on various 
positions with higher responsibilities outside his cadre and obtained 
numerous achievements while serving the State as well as citizens 
of Pakistan. When the Respondent No.1 sought nominations of 
suitable persons on 27.12.2021 from all the Ministries/Divisions, 
including the Respondent No.4, for conferment of the Award on the 
Independence Day, the FGEI duly forwarded his name alongwith 
others for the said purpose, but the “Ministry of Defence” 
recommended only names of the persons of their own choice by 
ignoring the recommendations which were made by the “FGEI” 
strictly in accordance with the General Instructions and Legal 
Provision for Making Recommendations for Pakistan Civil Awards 
(the “Instructions”) issued by the Government of Pakistan, 
Cabinet Secretariat, Cabinet Division, Awards Wing, thus, his 
name could not be considered by the Committee. He maintained 
that the act of the Respondent No.4 is illegal, arbitrary in nature 
depriving him from his accrued right of conferment of the Award. 
He argued that the principles of transparency and fair play have 

W.P.No.3542/2022 
 
 
 
  
       3 
been ignored by the authorities while proceeding with conferment 
of the Award. He next contended that even otherwise the 
Committee is not competent to confer the Award on any citizen of 
Pakistan and such power only vests with the President as per 
Article 259 of the “Constitution”. He has also drawn attention 
towards notification dated 13.06.2022 (the “Notification”) issued 
by the Cabinet Division under Rule 3(4) of the Rules of Business, 
1973 (the “Rules”) regarding reconstitution of various Award 
Committees for scrutiny and recommendation of nominees for 
conferment of the Award.  
III.    RESPONDENTS’ ARGUMENTS 
(a) Submissions of the Respondent No.1 (Secretary,       
Cabinet Division, Islamabad) 
 
4. 
The Respondent No.1, in his report and parawise comments, 
has only laid down emphasis on the point that name of the 
Petitioner was not considered by the Committee for conferment of 
the Award because his matter was not forwarded by his nominating 
agency i.e. the Ministry of Defence. It has further submitted that 
conferment of the Award is not the vested right of any citizen, 
therefore, it cannot be claimed as a matter of right.  
(b) Submissions of the Respondents No.2, 4 and 5 
(Secretary to Prime Minister, Prime Minister’s Office, 
Constitution Avenue, Islamabad; Secretary, Ministry of 
Defence, Rawalpindi Cantt. and Director General, Federal 
Government Educational Institutions (Cantt./Garrison) 
Directorate, Rawalpindi Cantt. 
 
5. 
In their report and para-wise comments, the Respondents 
have objected to the maintainability of this petition by submitting 
that the Petitioner has no locus standi to approach this Court 
because he is neither an “aggrieved party” nor “aggrieved person”. 
They further submitted that the Petitioner has no legal right to claim 
the Award and the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under 
Article 199 of the “Constitution” can only be invoked when any 
legal or fundamental right of a citizen of this country, as guaranteed 

W.P.No.3542/2022 
 
 
 
  
       4 
by the “Constitution”, is violated. They prayed for dismissal of the 
writ petition.     
6. 
Arguments heard and record perused.  
IV.    DETERMINATION BY THE COURT 
 
7. 
The basic issue in this case is whether the Petitioner, if once 
nominated, is to be conferred the Award under the law and for this 
purpose, the Court has to examine the relevant law and the 
procedure. Article 259 of the “Constitution” describes the Award, 
which is reproduced hereunder for ready reference:- 
“259. (1) 
No citizen shall accept any title, 
honour or decoration from any foreign State 
except with the approval of the Federal 
Government. 
(2) 
No title, honour or decoration shall be 
conferred by the Federal Government or any 
Provincial Government on any citizen, but 
the President may award decorations in 
recognition of gallantry, meritorious service 
in the Armed Forces, academic distinction or 
distinction in the field of sports or nursing, as 
provided by the Federal law. 
(3) 
All titles, honours and decorations 
awarded to citizens by any authority in 
Pakistan before the commencing day other-
wise than in recognition of gallantry, 
meritorious service in the Armed Forces or 
academic distinction shall stand annulled.” 
 
  
Section 3 of the Decorations Act, 1975 (the “Act”) also 
mentions the complete mechanism regarding the decorations, which 
reads as under:- 
“3. Institution or creation of decorations.-
(1) The President may, by warrant, institute, 
or create, from time to time any decorations 
in recognition of gallantry, meritorious 
service in the Armed Forces, academic 
distinction or distinction in the field of sports 
or nursing and prescribe the conditions 
under which a decoration may be awarded, 
conferred, withdrawn, forfeited or annulled, 
or may be restored after its withdrawal, 
forfeiture or annulment. 

W.P.No.3542/2022 
 
 
 
  
       5 
(2)  The President may also award 
decoration posthumously and the monetary 
reward, if any, attached to the decoration 
shall be paid to the next of kin of the person 
to whom the decoration is awarded. 
(3)  No decoration shall be awarded, 
conferred, withdrawn, forfeited or annulled, 
and 
no 
decoration 
which 
has 
been 
withdrawn, forfeited or annulled shall be 
restored, except with the personal approval 
of the President.  
(4) Every award, conferment, withdrawal, 
forfeiture, annulment and restoration of a 
decoration shall be published in the official 
Gazette.” 
 
  
If Article 259(2) of the “Constitution” and provisions of 
Section 3 of the “Act” are put in juxta-position, it would be 
clarified that the President can only award the title, honour or 
decoration on any citizen in recognition of gallantry (awards in 
relation to Shuja’at), academic distinction (awards in the order of 
Imtiaz), sports, nursing, human rights and public service (awards in 
the order of Imtiaz) and the power to withdraw, forfeit or annul a 
title or decoration also vests with the President on whose personal 
approval, the title or decoration shall be restored if once withdrawn, 
forfeited or annulled. Now, the question arises what is the legal 
procedure for nomination of the Award as claimed by the 
Petitioner. As per the Act, the term “gallantry” has been redefined 
to include an act of bravery, heroism, courage and rendering 
dedicated services with self-sacrificing commitment in human 
rights and public service. The announcement for conferment of the 
Award is made once a year on the Independence Day (14th August) 
and the investiture ceremony takes place on the following Pakistan 
Day (23rd March). In this case, the most relevant procedural part is 
the recommendations, which are invited by the Cabinet Division in 
December every year from all the Ministries/Divisions as well as 
the Provincial Governments. The complete particulars of the 
recommendees are firstly placed before the Awards Committee 
which, after conducting various meeting sessions and due scrutiny 

W.P.No.3542/2022 
 
 
 
  
       6 
of the relevant documents, places the said details before the Main 
Awards Committee headed by the Federal Ministers, which then 
move a summary to the President through the Prime Minister for 
final approval. It is pertinent to mention here that the 
“Notification” and the “Instructions” have also been issued in this 
regard by the Cabinet Division but the “Notification” shows 
various committees which include (i) Awards Sub-Committee on 
Science, Engineering & Education; (ii) Awards Sub-Committee on 
Arts and Literature; (iii) Awards Sub-Committee on Social/Welfare 
Work/Charity & Philanthropy; and (iv) Main Awards Committee 
while the "Instructions” discuss scope of the Award and also 
narrate various steps necessary for its recommendations. Criteria 
and the fields of activity for the conferment of the Award have been 
given in the Warrant of Institution of Pakistan Awards (Civil), the 
Warrant of Institution of the President’s Award for Pride of 
Performance and the Warrant of Institution of the Awards in the 
Orders of Pakistan, Quaid-i-Azam and Khidmat, whereas the cases 
of the civil servants for nominations are processed through the 
Establishment Division, which scrutinizes the claims critically and 
verifies the credentials of the nominees.  
V. 
CONCLUSION  
 
8. 
There is a complete mechanism for conferment of the 
Awards and after adopting all the procedural steps, the matter has 
been referred by the Committee to the President for conferment of 
the Award, therefore, the contention raised by the Petitioner  
that the Committee has no authority to confer the Award on any 
citizen of Pakistan has no force. There are many kinds of  
awards, few whereof famously are known as (i) Nishan-i-Imtiaz  
(ii) Hilal-i-Pakistan (iii) Sitara-i-Shujaat (iv) Sitara-i-Imtiaz and  
(v) President’s Award for Pride of Performance. There is no 
denying that Article 4 of the “Constitution” guarantees right of 
individuals to be dealt with strictly in accordance with law, but at 
the same pedestal Article 5(2) thereof requires obedience to the 

W.P.No.3542/2022 
 
 
 
  
       7 
“Constitution” and law is the inviolable obligation of every citizen. 
Record reveals that the Petitioner is employee of the Respondent 
No.5, which is attached department of the “Ministry of Defence” 
under Schedule II of the Rules, and though the “FGEI” has 
forwarded his name to the Respondent No.4 for further 
recommendation to the Cabinet Division for conferment of the 
Award in relation to his public service as a civil servant, but the 
“Ministry of Defence” has not further recommended his name for 
nomination of the Award. Merely nominating name of the 
Petitioner by his parent Department to the relevant Division, does 
not create any legal/vested or fundamental right in his favour. In 
this regard, reference can be made to the verdict rendered by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the judgment reported as 
“MUHAMMAD AKBAR versus FEDERATION OF PAKISTAN, 
MINISTRY OF LAW AND JUSTICE (JUSTICE DIVISION), 
ISLAMABAD through Secretary and another” (1996 SCMR 1017) 
in which it has been held that the Government is neither bound to 
accept the recommendation nor a vested right is accrued in favour 
of the person/party claiming such right merely because his/her 
name was recommended by the authority. This view has 
subsequently been followed by this Court in the case of “NAZIR A. 
KHAN SWATI versus MINISTRY OF LAW & JUSTICE and others” 
[1998 PLC (C.S) 372], wherein it has been observed that “mere 
nomination of the petitioner for the appointment against the 
advertised post did not create any vested right in the petitioner”. 
Though the “Constitution” has conferred power on the High 
Courts, but for the enforcement of fundamental rights and not to 
create such rights as has been laid down by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of “ASDULLAH MANGI and others versus 
PAKISTAN INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES CORPORATION and 
others” (2005 SCMR 445). Moreover, this Court can only declare 
the pre-existing right, but cannot create a new right through a 
declaration, while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 199 of 

W.P.No.3542/2022 
 
 
 
  
       8 
the “Constitution” and consideration for conferment of the Award 
is not a pre-existing right of the Petitioner. Another important 
aspect of the matter is that the Petitioner is neither an aggrieved 
party nor aggrieved person therefore, no legal or fundamental right 
has been violated by any authority. In the case of “KAMRAN 
MARTIN versus Mst. SIERA BIBI and 4 others” [2017 PLC (C.S.) 
597], the Division Bench of this Court has already held that “a 
person to have locus standi to initiate a petition for issuance of 
writ, he/she must have some right in the matter and he/she need not 
have a right in that strict sense of the term which is provided in 
Article 170 of the Constitution.”  Here, reference can also be made 
to the judgment passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 
case of “Dr. IMRAN KHATTAK and another versus Ms. SOFIA 
WAQAR KHATTAK, PSO to Chief Justice and others” (2014 
SCMR 122) wherein it has held that “no Judge of a High Court or 
the supreme Court is robed, crowned and sceptered as a King to do 
whatever suits his whim and caprice. In all eventualities, he is 
bound to abide by and adhere to the law and the Constitution.”  
9. 
It is also to be noted that the Cabinet Division invites 
nominations for the Pakistan Civil Awards from the Provincial 
Ministries/Divisions every year in the month of December or 
January with a cut-off date of 15th April, through a circular, and as 
per the given selection process, each nomination is considered by 
the respective nominating agency. After receiving of nominations 
in the Cabinet Division, the documents are verified and placed 
before the respective Awards Sub-Committee headed by the 
concerned Federal Ministers and once final recommendation is 
made by the Main Awards Committee, a summary is moved to the 
President of Pakistan, through the Prime Minister, for approval 
under provisions of Article 259(2) of the “Constitution” read with 
the Act. In this case, the Petitioner never approached the Cabinet 
Division on account of his nomination having not been forwarded 
by his nominating agency i.e. the Ministry of Defence, which fact 

W.P.No.3542/2022 
 
 
 
  
       9 
he admitted in paragraph-5 of his petition, thus cannot claim such 
award as a matter of right in light of the law discussed in 
aforementioned judgments. It is unequivocal that name of the 
Petitioner was recommended by the Respondent No.5/Major 
General Muhammad Asghar, Director General, FGEI (C/G) 
Directorate, Rawalpindi on 15.04.2022, as is evident from 
Annexure-D (page 17), on the Recommendation Form alongwith 
the Revised Quantification Performa and Citation dated 7th April, 
2022 [which are available at pages 18 to 20 of this petition] by 
clarifying that in recognition of his long meritorious services and 
numerous achievements in the field of Public Service at various 
positions in past, where he rendered services towards the welfare of 
people and the betterment of nation, he is strongly recommended 
for Civil Award of “Sitara-i-Imtiaz” to be conferred on the eve of 
Independence Day. However, this recommendation was then 
forwarded to the “Ministry of Defence” which did not further 
forward the same to the Cabinet Division, therefore, name of the 
Petitioner could not be considered for conferment of the Award. 
When confronted to the Petitioner whether he approached the 
“Ministry of Defence” or the Cabinet Division for the highlighting 
the aforesaid aspect of not nominating his name for conferment of 
the Award, he answered in negative. Further, the recommendations 
have been made by the “Ministry of Defence” on 06.07.2022, as 
reflected from the letter/Annexure-A, but the Petitioner, who was 
well aware of this fact, has approached this Court on 07.12.2022 
after a considerable delay of about five months. He remained mum 
during the intervening period and failed to give any satisfactory 
answer in this regard as well.  
10. 
In view of the above backdrop, as the Petitioner has neither 
approached the “Ministry of Defence” nor the Cabinet Division for 
agitating the matter therefore merely, recommending his name by 
the nominating agency does not create any substantial or 
fundamental right for conferment of the Award in his favour in 

W.P.No.3542/2022 
 
 
 
  
       10 
light of the judgments passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan as 
well as this Court, mentioned above. Hence his prayer to direct the 
Respondent No.4/Ministry of Defence to forward his name to the 
Cabinet Division, cannot be allowed. This writ petition is, 
therefore, dismissed being not maintainable. However, as this is a 
first kind of case in Pakistan (as per Article 259 of the 
“Constitution” and the Declarations Act, 1975) in which a 
principle [that mere recommendation of the name of a person for 
Civil Award, does not create any fundamental right, in favour of the 
said person for conferment of the such award] has been discussed 
and finally settled by this Court. 
11. 
Accordingly, copy of this judgment be transmitted to the 
Respondents [Secretary, Cabinet, Division, Islamabad; Secretary to 
Prime Minister, Prime Minister’s Office, Constitution Avenue, 
Islamabad; Secretary, Ministry of Planning, Development & 
Reforms, Islamabad; Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Rawalpindi 
Cantt. and Director General, Federal Government Educational 
Institutions (Cantt/Garrison) Directorate, Rawalpindi, Cantt.] for 
preparing a proper mechanism/criteria about the recommendation 
process by the Agency/Authority with the proper Citation as per the 
provisions of the Act [the Decorations Act, 1975]; the Instructions 
[General 
Instructions 
and 
Legal 
Provision 
for 
Making 
Recommendations for Pakistan Civil Awards]; the Notification 
[dated 13.06.2022, issued by the Cabinet Division] and the Rules 
[the Rules of Business, 1973] before finalizing and then forwarding 
the matter to the concerned Division or Committee in order to avoid 
further litigation like this, which has been put to end.
