Date of Hearing:

Appellant by: 
Mr. 
Muhammad 
Jamil 
Ashraf 
Chauhan, Advocate. 
Respondent by: 
Mian Subah Sadiq Klasson, Advocate. 
       Anwaar Hussain, J.  This Regular First Appeal is directed against 
judgment and decree dated 25.03.2022, passed in suit instituted by the 
respondent, for recovery of Rs.1,200,000/-, on the basis of Demand 
Promissory Note dated 28.06.2016.  
2. 
Learned counsel for the appellant while referring to Article 73 of 
the First Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1908 („the Act‟) submits that 
the suit instituted by the respondent was time barred by one year and 
one month as the impugned pro-note was executed on 28.06.2016, 
whereas, the suit was instituted on 28.07.2020. Adds that this aspect 
has not been addressed by the learned Trial Court. On a pointed 
question by this Court as to whether question of limitation was raised 
before the learned Trial Court and issue was framed in this regard, it 
was frankly conceded that no such objection was raised, however, 
learned counsel for the appellant contends that the learned Trial Court 
was verbally requested to address the limitation issue but the needful 
has not been done. Further avers that question of limitation is legal in 
nature and can be raised at the appellate stage. Concludes that even 
otherwise, it is settled legal position that the Court itself is obligated to 
examine the question of limitation irrespective of the fact whether the 
same is raised or not.

3. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent supports the 
impugned judgment and decree and while responding to the question of 
limitation submits that the loan given on the basis of impugned pro-
note was payable on demand (عندالطلب) and the time limitation for 
institution of the suit is to be reckoned from the date when the demand 
was made, and the same was not met and not from the date of the pro-
note.  
4. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
5. 
Before addressing the merits of the case in respect of which 
learned counsel for the appellant has only contended that the impugned 
pro-note alongwith a cheque was given, to the respondent, as surety in 
furtherance of a property-related transaction between the parties, it will 
be appropriate to first examine and opine as regards the question of 
limitation raised before this Court. In this regard, legal question boiling 
down for determination of this Court is to answer whether three years-
time limitation period prescribed for institution of suit, under Order 
XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 („the CPC‟), on the 
basis of negotiable instrument is to be reckoned from date of execution 
of the instrument in terms of Article 73 of the Act or from any other 
date such as date of demand of payment followed by the default 
thereof. 
6. 
Article 73 of the Act contemplates as under: 
 
Description of suit 
Period of 
limitation 
Time from 
which period 
begins to run 
73 
On a bill of exchange 
or 
promissory 
note 
payable on demand 
and not accompanied 
by 
any 
writing 
restraining 
or 
postponing the right to 
sue. 
Three years 
The date of the 
bill or note. 

3 
RFA No.31378 of 2022 
 
 
Whereas Article 64-A, inserted through an amendment on 04.03.1961 
in the Act, reads as under: 
 
Description of suit 
Period of 
limitation 
Time from 
which period 
begins to run 
64-A Under 
Order 
XXXVII of the Code 
of Civil Procedure  
Three years 
When the debt 
becomes 
payable 
While Article 73 of the Act envisages the time to start running from the 
date of the negotiable instrument, Article 64-A contemplates that time 
begins to run when the debt becomes payable.  
7. 
The term „payable‟ in relation to a debt/loan means how and 
when an amount of money should be paid by the borrower to the 
lender. To determine this point, the contents of the Promissory Note are 
to be looked into. Learned counsel for the appellant could not deny that 
amount mentioned in the impugned pro-note was clearly stated to be 
payable on demand. In case of a Demand Promissory Note, payment 
would become due when the demand is made and not met. Therefore, 
the present matter is governed by Article 64-A of the Act and starting 
point is when the debt becomes payable. This Court is of the opinion 
that after insertion of Article 64-A of the Act, money lend on the basis 
of a Demand Promissory Note is truly a demand loan and it only 
becomes payable once demand is made and not met and not from the 
date when the loan is first made and/or the said Promissory Note is 
executed.  
8. 
Keeping in view the observation that Article 64-A is applicable 
in the instant case, it will be in fitness of things to examine whether the 
appellant denied the assertion of the respondent regarding the time 
when the demand was raised by the latter. Per para 4 of the plaint, it is 
the case of the respondent that demand was made two days prior to the 
institution of the suit and upon refusal of the appellant, the suit was 
instituted. If the appellant had to dispute the fact that no such demand 

4 
RFA No.31378 of 2022 
 
 
was made, a plea in addition to the denial of the execution of the 
impugned pro-note, should have been categorically taken by 
responding to the relevant para of the plaint, on the basis of which, 
issue qua limitation should have been framed and in the absence of 
framing of such issue by the learned Trial Court, claim for framing of 
such issue should have been put forth and then proved accordingly. In 
the instant case, no such plea was taken regarding the time as to when 
the demand was raised by the respondent and only evasive denial had 
been put forth. The respondent was also not cross-examined on the 
point as to when the demand of payment was made, hence, the 
assertion of the respondent that the demand was made few days prior to 
the institution of the suit went unrebutted and accordingly proved. 
Therefore, the debt due under the impugned pro-note was payable from 
the date when the said demand was made and not met as mentioned in 
the plaint. Hence, this Court is of the opinion that objection that the suit 
was barred by limitation is misconceived and is accordingly discarded.  
9. 
Having held that the suit instituted by the respondent was well 
within time in terms of Article 64-A of the Act, scanning of the record 
reveals that the appellant obtained leave to appear and defend the suit, 
which was allowed and thereafter written statement was filed in which 
the claim of the respondent was denied. Needless to mention that 
presumption of due execution of a negotiable instrument, for 
consideration, is attached to the impugned pro-note in terms of 
provisions of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and it was obligatory 
on part of the appellant to rebut the same by leading evidence. In this 
regard, issue No.1 was specifically framed and is reproduced 
hereunder: 
“ISSUE NO.1: 
1. 
Whether the defendant borrowed suit amount of 
Rs.12,00,000/- from plaintiff and issued impugned 
promissory note and receipt for payment of said 

5 
RFA No.31378 of 2022 
 
 
amount and the plaintiff is entitled to recover suit 
amount from defendant? OPP” 
Appellant appeared as DW-1 and produced one Ghulam Rasool as 
DW-2 and also produced an agreement to sell as Exh-D1, whereas, the 
respondent himself appeared as PW-1 and produced Muhammad 
Saleem as PW-2, Muhammad Ahmad as PW-3, Hasnaat Ahmad as 
PW-4, Inam Khan as PW-5 and Rao Shahzad Rauf as PW-6. He also 
produced pro-note as Exh.P-1 and receipt thereof as Exh.P-2.  
10. 
The learned Trial Court after recording of evidence was 
persuaded to decree the suit, inter alia, on the ground that the appellant 
took contradictory rather destructive stance taken in the application for 
leave to appear and defend and the subsequent written statement that 
was filed after grant of the leave to defend. The learned Trial Court 
aptly encapsulated the entire controversy in the following terms: 
“8. ...When the defendant filed the application for leave to 
appear and defend the suit in that application he narrated 
that actually the defendant had entered into the agreement 
with the plaintiff for the purchase of two acers land for 
amount Rs.10,00,000/- out of which he paid amount 
Rs.4,40,000/- and as a guarantee handed over to the plaintiff 
one cheque and the disputed pronote. That the defendant has 
misused that pronote and has filed this suit. Contrary to this 
stance taken in the leave to appear and defend the suit the 
defendant in his written statement mentioned that neither he 
received any amount from the plaintiff, nor he issued the 
disputed pronote or made signature or thumb impression on 
the pronote. These two stances of the defendant first taken in 
the application for leave to appear and defend and second 
taken in his written statement are self-contradictory. In leave 
to appear and defend the defendant admitted handing over the 
pronote and his thumb impression on the pornote (sic) also, 
however, in written statement he denied all these facts straight 
way. As such handing over the disputed pronote by the 
defendant to the plaintiff is considered admitted and his 
thumb impression on the pronotes are also admitted. Original 
pronote and receipts pronote have been produced in the 
evidence by the plaintiff and the plaintiff has also produced 
marginal witnesses of the receipt pronote and scribe of the 
pronote also in his evidence. On the other hand defendant 
himself appeared as DW-1 and he produced his brother 

6 
RFA No.31378 of 2022 
 
 
Ghulam Rasool as DW-2. Ghulam Rasool DW-2 in his 
examination in chief stated that he has no knowledge that 
why the disputed pronote had been executed. It shows that 
the DW-2 is not aware of the facts of the dispute between the 
parties. In this way evidence of the plaintiff regarding due 
execution of the pronote is confidence inspiring at the 
defendant failed to rebut the evidence of the plaintiff.” 
 
 
 
 
 
             (Emphasis supplied) 
Learned counsel for the appellant was confronted with the operative 
part of the impugned judgment, however, he was unable to put forth 
any plausible reason and justify contradictory and mutually destructive 
stances taken by the appellant, referred in the impugned judgment. The 
appellant‟s case clearly falls under the clutches of latin maxim 
„Allegans Contraria Non-Est Audiendus‟ (A person adducing to the 
contrary is not to be heard) and his stance regarding denial of receipt of 
any amount cannot be extended any weightage. 
11. 
Despite arguing the case at full length, learned counsel for the 
appellant side could not point out any misreading or non-reading of 
evidence, substantial error, illegality, infirmity or jurisdictional error in 
the impugned judgment passed by the learned Additional District 
Judge, Depalpur. The judgment impugned herein is well reasoned and 
based on the evidence available on record, therefore, this Court is of 
considered opinion that the same does not call for any interference. 
Hence, the present Regular First Appeal, being devoid of any force, is 
dismissed. No order as to costs.
