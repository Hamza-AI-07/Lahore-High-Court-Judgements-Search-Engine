ABID AZIZ SHEIKH, J. This Election Appeal has been 
filed under Section 63 of the Elections Act, 2017 (Act) against 
the order dated 22.03.2023 (impugned order), passed by the 
Returning Officer of PP-82 Khushab-1 (respondent No.1), 
whereby the appellant’s nomination papers have been rejected. 
2. 
Relevant facts are that the appellant filed his nomination 
papers to be a candidate of PP-82 Khushab-1 in respect of the 
General Elections of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, 
2023 and after scrutiny thereof, his nomination papers were 
rejected through the impugned order for being outstanding 
liability of loan against the appellant, as reported by the State 

 
Election Appeal No.24133 of 2023 
                                                           (2) 
 
 
 
 
 
Bank of Pakistan (SBP). The appellant being aggrieved has 
filed this Appeal. 
3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that ex-parte 
judgment & decree dated 27.05.2013 (decree) was passed by 
the learned Judge Banking Court, Lahore against the appellant 
and in favour of respondent No.2 i.e. Bank Al-Falah Limited, 
Shahdin Manzil, The Mall, Lahore (respondent-Bank), for an 
amount of Rs.2,491,991.01/- plus cost of fund, however, before 
rejection of his nomination papers, the appellant entered into 
Settlement 
Agreement 
dated 
21.03.2023 
(Settlement 
Agreement) with the respondent-Bank for return of the settled 
amount of Rs.1,850,000/- till 25.04.2024. He adds that down 
payment of Rs.200,000/- has already been paid. He contends 
that in the circumstances, there is no default on part of the 
appellant on the date of passing of the impugned order under 
Article 63(1)(n) & (o) of the Constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (Constitution) and if at all, there 
was any default, the same has been settled, hence, the 
nomination papers of the appellant could not be rejected under 
Section 62(10) of the Act. 
4. 
Learned counsel for the respondent No.1, on the other 
hand, supported the impugned order. Learned counsel for 
respondent-Bank confirmed that there was decree passed 

 
Election Appeal No.24133 of 2023 
                                                           (3) 
 
 
 
 
 
against the appellant and its execution was also filed but the 
same was adjourned sine-die due to non-availability of the 
assets, however, the parties have finally entered into Settlement 
Agreement. 
5. 
Arguments heard. There is no dispute that the decree for 
an amount of Rs.2,491,991.01/- plus cost of fund was passed 
against the appellant by the learned Banking Court, Lahore and 
its execution was also filed, which was however adjourned 
sine-die. It is also a matter of record that as per Election 
Schedule, the last date for filing of nomination papers with the 
Returning Officer by the candidates was 16.03.2023 and till the 
said date, neither the decree was satisfied nor any Settlement 
Agreement was executed between the appellant and respondent-
Bank. However, the Settlement Agreement was executed on 
21.03.2023 before the rejection of nomination papers on 
22.03.2023. In the above factual background, the legal question 
required determination is that what is the cutoff date for 
disqualification of a candidate under Article 63(1)(n) & (o) of 
the Constitution for failure to pay the loan, government dues 
and utility expense. In this context, for convenience, the 
aforesaid Article 63(1)(n) & (o) of the Constitution are 
reproduced hereunder:- 
“63. (1) A person shall be disqualified from 
being elected or chosen as, and from being, 

 
Election Appeal No.24133 of 2023 
                                                           (4) 
 
 
 
 
 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Majlis-e-Shoora 
(Parliament), if – 
 
(n) 
he has obtained a loan for an 
amount of two million rupees or 
more, from any bank, financial 
institution, co-operative society 
or co-operative body in his own 
name or in the name of his spouse 
or any of his dependents, which 
remains unpaid for more than one 
year from the due date, or has got 
such loan written off; or 
 
(o) 
he or his spouse or any of his 
dependents 
has 
defaulted 
in 
payment of government dues and 
utility 
expenses, 
including 
telephone, electricity, gas and 
water charges in excess of ten 
thousand rupees, for over six 
months, at the time of filing his 
nomination papers;” 
 
                  (Emphasis supplied) 
The aforesaid disqualifications under Article 63 of the 
Constitution are also applicable to the members of a 
Provincial 
Assembly 
under 
Article 
113 
of 
the 
Constitution and Section 231 of the Act.  
6. 
The plain reading of Article 63(1)(n) of the 
Constitution shows that a person shall be disqualified 
from being elected or chosen as, and from being, a 
member of the Majlis-e-Shoora, if he has obtained a loan 
for an amount of two million rupees or more, from any 
bank, financial institution, co-operative society or co-
operative body in his own name or in the name of his 

 
Election Appeal No.24133 of 2023 
                                                           (5) 
 
 
 
 
 
spouse or any of his dependents, which remains unpaid 
for more than one year from the due date, or has got such 
loan written off. Whereas under Sub-Article (o) of 
Article 63(1) of the Constitution, he will be disqualified, 
if he or his spouse or any of his dependents has defaulted 
in payment of government dues and utility expenses, 
including telephone, electricity, gas and water charges in 
excess of ten thousand rupees, for over six months, at the 
time of filing his nomination papers. The words “at the 
time of filing his nomination papers”, used in Article 
63(1)(o) of the Constitution, manifest that cutoff date 
envisaged under Article 63(1)(n) or (o) of the 
Constitution before which the disqualification be 
removed, is the time of filing of nomination papers.  
7. 
The learned Full Bench of this Court in “RASHID 
Vs. RETURNING OFFICER, Nankana Sahib” (PLD 
2013 Lahore 509), while interpreting Article 63(1)(n) & 
(o) of the Constitution, held that disqualifications under 
aforesaid Article crystalizes when the default subsists till 
the time of filing nomination papers. The relevant part of 
the judgment is reproduced hereunder:- 
“8. What is then the cutoff date for the 
deposit of unpaid loan to avoid the mischief 
of disqualification under Article 63(1)(n) or 
the 
last 
date 
for 
curing 
the 
said 

 
Election Appeal No.24133 of 2023 
                                                           (6) 
 
 
 
 
 
disqualification? First, parallel can be 
drawn 
with 
Article 
63(1)(o) 
of 
the 
Constitution that also deals with similar 
disqualification regarding government dues 
and utility expenses. In the said Article 
disqualification is attracted when the 
default in the payment of government dues 
or utility expenses subsists for over a period 
of six months till the time of filing of 
nomination papers. The importance of the 
time of filing of the nomination papers 
cannot be over emphasized. It is the entry 
point for a candidate to step into the 
electoral process and in the wisdom of the 
Constitution the candidate must not only be 
qualified but must also be free from any 
taint of disqualification at this initial stage. 
Similarly Article 63(1)(n) also crystallizes if 
the loan remains unpaid till the time of 
filing of the nomination papers. Any 
payment made after filing of the nomination 
papers does not cure this constitutional 
disqualification. Reading the time of the 
"filing of the nomination papers" as the 
cutoff date in both the above constitutional 
disqualifications advances a harmonious 
interpretation of the constitution and avoids 
the possibility of discrimination in the 
application of the above Articles, which 
carry similar objectives and purposes.” 
 
The same view was also expressed by the learned Full 
Bench of this Court in “HAMEED AKBAR KHAN Vs. 
ELECTION APPELLATE TRIBUNAL and others” (PLD 
2013 Lahore 548). The hon’ble Supreme Court in 
“ATIQUE REHMAN Vs. HAJI KHAN AFZAL and 
others” (2007 SCMR 507), while interpreting Section 99 
of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 (ROPA) 
held that qualifications and disqualifications, prescribed 

 
Election Appeal No.24133 of 2023 
                                                           (7) 
 
 
 
 
 
under said Section, must be fulfilled on the date of filing 
of nomination papers. The relevant observations are 
reproduced as under:- 
“After hearing the learned counsel for the 
parties at length and having carefully 
perused the record with their assistance, we 
in the light of the provisions of section 99 of 
the Act, 1976 have found that a candidate 
intending to contest election for the seat of 
member Provincial Assembly must fulfill the 
condition 
contained 
therein 
including 
attaining the age of 25 years on the date of 
filing the nomination papers and should 
also be enrolled as voter in the constituency 
from which he is contesting the Election.” 
 
The same view was earlier expressed by the hon’ble 
Supreme Court in “WAQAS AKRAM Vs. MUHAMMAD 
TAHIRUL QADRI and others” (2003 SCMR 145).  
8. 
In view of the law settled in the afore-noted 
judgments, there is no manner of doubt that the cutoff 
date for clearing bank default was 16.03.2023 being the 
last date for filing of nomination papers and therefore, 
the subsequent Settlement Agreement dated 21.03.2023 
executed between the appellant and respondent-Bank will 
not absolve the appellant from the disqualification 
prescribed under Article 63(1)(n) of the Constitution. 
9. 
The next argument of the appellant that as he has 
entered into Settlement Agreement before last date for 
filing of nomination papers with the respondent No.1, 

 
Election Appeal No.24133 of 2023 
                                                           (8) 
 
 
 
 
 
therefore, his nomination papers could not be rejected 
under Section 62(10) of the Act, is also misconceived. In 
this regard, for ready reference Section 62(10) of the Act 
is reproduced hereunder:- 
“62(10) 
Notwithstanding 
anything 
contained in sub-section (9), where a 
candidate deposits any amount of loan, tax 
or government dues and utility expenses 
payable by him of which he is unaware at 
the time of filing of his nomination paper, 
such nomination paper shall not be rejected 
on the ground of default in payment of such 
loan, taxes or government dues and utility 
expenses.” 
 
10. 
No doubt Section 62(10) of the Act is a non-
obstante clause and under said sub-section where a 
candidate deposits any amount of loan, tax or 
government dues and utility expenses payable by him of 
which he is unaware at the time of filing of his 
nomination papers, such nomination papers shall not be 
rejected on the ground of default in payment of such 
loan, taxes or government dues and utility expenses. 
However, while interpreting similar Section 14(3A) of 
ROPA, the learned Full Bench of this Court in Rashid’s 
Case supra held that this provision is inconsistent with 
Article 63(1)(o) of the Constitution and disrupts the 
harmony of the Constitutional provision which cannot be 

 
Election Appeal No.24133 of 2023 
                                                           (9) 
 
 
 
 
 
permitted through sub-constitutional legislation. The 
relevant observations are reproduced as under:- 
“9. We are aware that section 14(3-A) of 
Representation of the People Act, 1976 
provides that if the payment of unpaid loan 
is made before the rejection of the 
nomination papers, the disqualification 
under Article 63 (1)(n) is not attracted. We 
are 
afraid 
the 
said 
provision 
of 
Representation of the People Act, 1976 
besides being inconsistent with Article 
63(1)(o), disrupts the harmony of  the 
constitutional 
provisions 
leading 
to 
discriminatory application of the above two 
constitutional 
disqualifications, 
which 
cannot 
be 
permitted 
through 
sub-
constitutional legislation. We therefore hold 
that disqualification under Article 63(1)(n) 
becomes compete only when the loan 
remains unpaid for over a year till the date 
of filing of the nomination papers. We 
therefore also held that section 14(3-A) of 
Representation of the People Act, 1976 is 
inconsistent with the scheme of the 
Constitution in general and Article 63(1)(o) 
and (n) in particular.” 
 
11. 
Beside the above observation by the learned Full 
Bench of this Court, in any case the non-obstante 
provision of Section 62(10) of the Act can only be 
attracted where the candidate must show that he was 
unaware at the time of filing of his nomination papers 
about the loan, tax, government dues and utility expenses 
payable by him and he has paid the same before his 
nomination papers were rejected. In the present case, the 
appellant has neither demonstrated before the Returning 

 
Election Appeal No.24133 of 2023 
                                                           (10) 
 
 
 
 
 
Officer that he was not aware at the time of filing of his 
nomination papers about the loan nor same has been 
established before this Court. On the other hand, 
admittedly, the loan amount was availed by the appellant 
and in case of default, decree was passed on 27.05.2013 
and thereafter, its execution was filed, which was finally 
adjourned sine-die. Further, when the appellant himself 
entered into Settlement Agreement with the respondent-
Bank on 21.03.2023, he admits availing of the finance 
facility under the decree dated 27.05.2013, therefore, it 
cannot be pleaded that the appellant was not aware of the 
loan availed by him, which he finally settled through the 
Settlement Agreement, hence, the provision of Section 
62(10) of the Act is not attracted. 
12. 
In view of above discussion, this Election Appeal 
being meritless and without substance is dismissed.
