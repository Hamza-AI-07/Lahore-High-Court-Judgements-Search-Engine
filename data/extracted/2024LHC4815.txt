The 
instant 
constitutional petition is directed against order dated 
23.4.2022 of the learned Addl. District Judge, 
Sahiwal whereby the plaint in the suit of the 
petitioners against private respondents was rejected 
under Order VII, Rule 11, C.P.C. 
2. 
The petitioners filed a suit for declaration 
with consequential relief of permanent injunction 
against respondent Nos.2 and 3, Riaz Hussain and 
Niaz Ahmad, their brothers, to assail mutation of gift 
bearing No.2408 dated 15.12.2000. It was averred 
that the gift to their brothers attributed to their father 
Allah Yar was based on fraud and misrepresentation 
which was liable to be annulled and that the 
petitioners were entitled to their Islamic share qua 
the suit property. The suit was resisted by the 

    W.P. No.30762 of 2022 
 
 
 
Page-2 
 
 
respondents who in their written statement took an 
objection as to its maintainability on account of 
withdrawal of a previously filed suit by their father 
Allah Yar which objection was turned down by the 
learned Civil Judge vide order dated 26.3.2022. The 
respondents filed a revision petition thereagainst 
which was accepted and the plaint was rejected vide 
order dated 23.4.2022 of the learned Addl. District 
Judge, Sahiwal. 
3. 
The reason recorded in the impugned order 
is to the effect that the father of the present 
petitioners Allah Yar had filed a suit for cancellation 
of mutation of gift which was subject-matter of the 
petitioners’ suit against the respondent Nos.2 and 3 
that was later withdrawn vide order dated 29.5.2021, 
as such, the petitioners’ suit was not maintainable.  
4. 
Perusal of the said order shows that late 
Allah Yar, father of the litigants, allegedly recorded 
his statement as plaintiff that he did not want to 
further prosecute the suit and to withdraw the same. 
The order dated 29.5.2021 in the said suit also 
reflects that petitioners who were present before the 
trial court contested this request with the plea that 
their brothers had “snatched” their father from them 
and that he was not mentally/physically fit at the 
time, as such, his stance could not be accepted, 
which was without free consent. Order dated 
29.5.2021 records that after hearing arguments of 
both sides all present except Allah Yar were ordered 

    W.P. No.30762 of 2022 
 
 
 
Page-3 
 
 
to vacate the courtroom who was asked to sit there 
for fifteen minutes. The case was again called in the 
presence of both sides thereafter i.e. the sons and 
daughters and their learned counsel and it was 
recorded that the plaintiff Allah Yar was seventy 
years old, and his physical condition did not look 
good. 
The 
court, 
then, 
to 
ascertain 
the 
mental/physical condition of the plaintiff posed 
some questions; who was asked if he had gifted the 
land to the sons. He answered in the affirmative. He 
was further asked whether he wanted to get the land 
back, which he answered in the negative. In response 
to the question as to whom he was living with him, 
he stated that he was living with his sons. Based on 
these questions and answers it was assumed by the 
court that he looked mentally stable and statement 
was, accordingly, entered and the suit was dismissed 
as withdrawn. As it transpires Allah Yar died on the 
very same day i.e. 29.5.2021 after withdrawal of the 
suit which spoke volumes for his mental/physical 
health. 
5. 
In the previous hearing, learned counsel for 
the petitioners submitted that he was willing to move 
an application under section 12(2), C.P.C. to 
challenge the order and proceedings dated 29.5.2021 
in the earlier suit which resulted in dismissal of suit 
of 
Allah 
Yar 
on 
grounds 
of 
fraud 
and 
misrepresentation by withdrawing the 
instant 
constitutional petition provided the petitioners are 

    W.P. No.30762 of 2022 
 
 
 
Page-4 
 
 
protected from the rigor of limitation in that 
eventuality. At the time of dictating judgment, it was 
observed that certain important questions will have 
to be addressed in this case, for considering the 
question of maintainability of suit which has not 
been attended by the court below; the case was 
accordingly fixed for re-hearing/further hearing. In 
pursuance thereof, the parties’ learned counsels were 
heard. 
6. 
The attendant circumstances of withdrawal 
of suit by Allah Yar have been carefully weighed 
who died on same day i.e. 29.5.2021 when his 
statement is claimed to have been recorded for 
disposal of the suit which raised serious doubt as to 
the mental and physical condition, to record any 
statement of his free will and consent. Counsel for 
the petitioners and the petitioners themselves were 
shown to be present on the date of proceedings who 
seriously objected and pointed out to the court that 
Allah Yar was not in a position to record his 
statement and that he is mentally and physically 
feeble and, therefore, his statement could not be 
recorded but despite that the proceedings were held 
which gave rise to the question as to whether the 
court was not under obligation to seek medical 
assistance in the matter before recording the 
statement of Allah Yar to verify his soundness of 
mental condition, particularly, when it was pointedly 
disputed by the petitioners and whether in these 

    W.P. No.30762 of 2022 
 
 
 
Page-5 
 
 
circumstances the proceedings and the order passed 
in consequence thereto shall be deemed to be illegal 
and void ab initio. In Jeewan Shah v. Muhammad 
Shah (PLD 2006 SC 202) it was observed as under: 
5. There is no cavil with the proposition 
that in a civil suit the question of insanity 
cannot be determined without recording 
evidence by affording proper opportunity of 
hearing 
to 
the 
party 
concerned 
to 
substantiate the factum of insanity by 
leading evidence. The Court is duty bound 
to protect the interest of a lunatic  person… 
7. 
In the given circumstances the question 
would be as to whether the order of the court dated 
29.5.2021 in the earlier case could be deemed to be 
valid or the same was without jurisdiction and ab 
initio void and, as such, need not be challenged 
separately particularly when the petitioners were not 
given an opportunity of evidence. In the order dated 
26.3.2022 of learned Civil Judge, impugned in civil 
revision the learned Addl. District Judge while 
considering the objection as to the maintainability of 
suit 
observed 
that 
the 
objection 
to 
the 
maintainability of  the suit was based on order dated 
29.5.2021 whereby the predecessor-in-interest of the 
parties namely Allah Yar got recorded his statement 
on 29.5.2021 whereby the court specifically 
mentioned that the condition of his health was not 
good and this fact was also corroborated from the 
death certificate of Allah Yar who passed away on 
the same day i.e. 29.5.2021, hence, his statement 
may be taken into consideration with context of 

    W.P. No.30762 of 2022 
 
 
 
Page-6 
 
 
other operative factual conditions including his death 
the same day. The view taken by the learned Civil 
Judge, as such, appears to be just and fair in the 
circumstances of the case which could not  possibly 
be disturbed in revisional jurisdiction by the learned 
Addl. District Judge.  
8. 
As regards the submissions of learned 
counsel that he was willing to withdraw the 
constitutional petition to file an application under 
section 12(2), C.P.C. provided the petitioners are 
saved from rigor of limitation, which has been 
seriously opposed by learned counsel for the 
respondents who submitted that such a request could 
not be allowed at this stage nor the plaint could be 
converted into an application under section 12(2), 
C.P.C.   In the case of Noor UL Amin and another v. 
Muhammad Hashim and 27 others (1992 SCMR 
1744) it was observed as under: 
It is well settled, that all procedural laws are 
meant for advancing the cause of justice 
and they cannot be made a vehicle of 
oppression to suppress the remedies. It is 
also well-accepted principle of law that 
Courts 
always 
lean 
in 
favour 
of 
adjudication on merit rather than stifling 
proceedings on technicalities. A cursory 
reading of the plaint in Suit No.231 of 1986 
instituted by the petitioners will show that it 
contained all the ingredients of section 
12(2), C.P.C. Mere fact that it was described 
as a plaint and was registered as plaint 
could not deprive the Court of its 
jurisdiction to decide it as an application 
under section 12(2), C.P.C. if otherwise 
such jurisdiction was available to the Court 
under the law. It is not disputed before us 

    W.P. No.30762 of 2022 
 
 
 
Page-7 
 
 
that an application under section 12(2), 
C.P.C. could be filed for setting aside the 
decree in suit No.119/1 of 1983 on the 
grounds mentioned in the plaint in Suit 
No.231/1 of 1986. In these circumstances 
the learned District Judge, Peshawar, was 
absolutely right in treating the plaint in Suit 
No.231/1 of 1986 as an application under 
section 12(2) of C.P.C. and remanding it to 
the Civil Judge who passed the decree in  
Suit No.119/1 
of 
1983 
for 
disposal 
according to law. The learned counsel for 
respondents Nos.1 to 5 is unable to point 
out any prejudice which could be caused to 
respondents by treating the plaint in Suit 
No.231/1 of 1986 as an application under 
section 12(2) of C.P.C. The Courts, in order 
to do justice between the parties, would 
generally allow treatment/conversion of 
proceedings of one kind into another, 
unless there exists some legal bar against 
such treatment/conversion. 
9. 
It was a case in which the oral gift was 
challenged 
on 
the 
grounds 
of 
fraud 
and 
misrepresentation by the petitioners whose case was 
that 
everything 
was 
done 
by 
the 
brothers 
fraudulently to deprive the sisters of right of 
inheritance and in such cases every effort shall be 
made to avoid technicalities and decide the cases on 
merits. Reference can also be made to the case of 
Syed Sadaqat Sultan v. Bahadar and another (2007 
YLR 2905) where it was observed that a suit for 
specific performance and cancellation of decree on 
the ground of fraud qua the suit property, the court 
had jurisdiction to decide the plaint as an application 
under section 12(2), C.P.C. In the light of rule in the 
case supra there can be no cavil with the proposition 
that the court is competent to convert the plaint in a 

    W.P. No.30762 of 2022 
 
 
 
Page-8 
 
 
suit into an application under section 12(2), C.P.C. 
and vice-versa provided just and fair circumstances 
obtained in the case to do so that also pointed to 
effective dispensation of justice. Be that as it may, 
this question will be considered by the court below 
as and when a request is made for conversion of 
plaint, into an application under section 12(2), 
C.P.C.  
10. 
For the reasons supra, the impugned order 
dated 23.4.2022 passed in revision by the learned 
Addl. District Judge, Sahiwal is set aside, and the 
case is remanded to the trial court for decision of 
question of maintainability of the suit in accordance 
with law keeping in view the observations made 
herein and above. The petition is allowed 
accordingly.
