Date of hearing:     16.04.2024. 
Appellants by: 
Mr. Muhammad Suleman Bhatti, Advocate.  
Respondent ex parte.  
 
MUHAMMAD SAJID MEHMOOD SETHI, J.- Through 
instant appeal, appellants have assailed vires of order dated 
26.04.2023, passed by learned Judge Banking Court-I, Multan, 
whereby non-bailable warrants of arrest of appellants were issued 
and CNICs of appellants No. 2 & 3 were blocked.  
2. 
Brief facts of the case are that respondent-bank filed suit for 
recovery of Rs. 51,28,534.37 along with mark up, cost and cost of 
funds from the date of expiry of finance till realization of dues. The 
suit was contested by appellants by filing petition for leave to 
defend the suit. Learned Judge Banking Court-II, Multan, after 
hearing the arguments of learned counsel for the parties, dismissed 
said application and passed judgment & decree dated 06.07.2010 
for recovery of Rs.51,28,533.59 with costs of suit and cost of funds 
till the date of its realization. During execution proceedings, 
respondent moved application for issuance of warrants of arrest and 
blockage of CNIC of the judgment-debtors. Learned Judge Banking 
Court-I, Multan, vide impugned order dated 26.04.2023 issued non-
bailable warrants of arrest against appellants No.2 & 3 along with 
direction to block their CNICs. Hence, instant appeal.

3. 
Learned counsel for appellants submits that neither any 
inquiry was conducted nor show cause notice was issued prior to 
issuance of non-bailable warrants of arrest, within the meaning of 
Order XXI Rules XXXVII & XL read with Section 51 CPC, 
therefore, impugned order is absolutely illegal and without lawful 
authority. In support, he has inter alia relied upon Messrs Azhar & 
Co. and others v. National Bank of Pakistan (2018 CLD 830) and 
Muhammad Asif v. Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Limited 
through Manager (2022 CLD 1021).  
4. 
None is present on behalf of respondent-bank to rebut the 
above submissions, since it has already been proceeded against ex 
parte vide order dated 21.09.2023.  
5. 
Heard. Available record perused.  
6. 
The order of learned Judge Banking for issuance of                     
warrant of arrest and blockage of CNICs of appellants No.2 & 3 are 
under-challenge before us.  
7. 
As regards blockage of the CNICs, we feel it appropriate to 
go through the provisions of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of 
Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (“FIO, 2001”) dealing with the powers 
of a Banking Court while executing a decree. Section 19 of the FIO, 
2001 mainly provides that mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated 
property and other assets of the judgment-debtor would be the 
subject matter of the execution. Section 19(2) provides various 
modes / actions to be taken by the Banking Court to execute a 
decree coupled with powers given in various sub-sections of 
Section 15 of the FIO, 2004 and bestows it with powers of 
Executing Court provided in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 or 
any other law for the time being in force. We have a glimpse to the 
afore-referred provisions of the FIO, 2001 together with the 
provisions of CPC dealing with powers of the Executing Court, 
however are unable to find any direct provision empowering to 
block CNIC of a judgment-debtor.

8. 
Section 18(1) of the National Database and Registration 
Authority Ordinance, 2000 empowers NADRA to cancel, 
impound or confiscate a CNIC, after giving notice in writing to 
the holder of CNIC to show cause as to why such order should not 
be passed. Section 18(2) enumerates the instances / circumstances 
in which such action can be taken, which includes (a) the card 
has been obtained by a person who is not eligible to hold such card, 
by posing himself as eligible; (b) more than one cards have been 
obtained by the same person on the same eligibility criteria;(c) the 
particulars shown on the card have been obliterated or tampered 
with; or (d) the card is forged. Apparently, no instance of 
blocking a CNIC, pertinently while conducting executing 
proceedings by a court of law, is visible in the afore-referred 
provision. Section 18(3) provides right of appeal to aggrieved 
person before the Federal Government against the order passed 
against him and again notice providing of hearing is expedient 
before deciding the appeal. We are mindful of the fact that the 
legislature has made it obligatory upon the NADRA authority as 
well as the appellate authority to have given a fair opportunity of 
hearing to lead the defence to the affected person in terms of 
Section 18 ibid. We have gone through the impugned order and 
proceedings being conducted before passing the said order and 
are astonished to observe that no such exercise of issuing a show 
cause notice to appellants to explain their position was 
undertaken by the learned Judge Banking Court.  
9. 
In the case reported as Muhammad Umar v Federation of 
Pakistan, through Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Islamabad and 2 
others (PLD 2017 Sindh 585), NADRA had blocked the 
petitioner’s CNIC by issuing a notice under Section 23 instead of 
Section 18 of the NADRA Ordinance. The Sindh High Court 
observed that while the term ‘block’ was alien to the NADRA 
Ordinance, Section 18 did allow the authority to impound a card 
under certain conditions. The act of impounding a document is 

 
 
EFA No.26 of 2023 
 
4
completed by taking possession of the document, thus, if NADRA 
decides to impound a card under the directives of the Federal 
Government, they may direct the person to deposit their CNIC to 
NADRA. It was further observed that, it is mandatory that NADRA 
issues notice to the concerned person of the same under the relevant 
section, and gives them a fair and proper chance of hearing. 
Therefore, ‘blocking’ of a CNIC without giving a chance of hearing 
was held to be illegal as the same was not warranted under the law. 
  
Likewise, this Court in the case reported as Hafiz Awais 
Zafar v Judge Family Court, Lahore and 2 others (PLD 2022 
Lahore 756), held that an individual cannot be deprived of his 
identity card without due process and “In as much as cancellation, 
impounding or confiscation of CNIC impacts the fundamental 
rights of a person, the provisions of section 18 of the Ordinance 
must be strictly construed and scrupulously followed. Any order 
passed or action taken on a consideration other than those 
stipulated therein cannot sustain.”  
 
Similarly, in the judgment reported as Urooj Tabani v 
Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Interior, 
Islamabad and 2 others (PLD 2021 Islamabad 105), NADRA had 
issued a notice to the petitioner that she had obtained her CNIC 
through unfair means, and then subsequently impounded her CNIC 
as well as segregated her from the family tree. The Islamabad High 
Court held that NADRA did not have the authority to ‘block’ a 
CNIC upon receiving the complaint of a third party as presumption 
of truth is attached to the CNIC and the particulars recorded therein. 
It was further observed that the powers of impounding, cancelling 
or confiscating a card under Section 18 are explicitly confined to 
the four grounds prescribed. 
10. 
Needless to say that Section 19 of the NADRA Ordinance, 
2000 specifies a few circumstances when the CNIC is 
compulsorily required, which include passport, permit or other 
travel documents for going out of Pakistan and identification of a 

 
 
EFA No.26 of 2023 
 
5
voter at various elections. Section 19(3) empowers the Federal 
Government to specify any other purpose for which the 
production of any card issued by NADRA shall be necessary. 
Presently, the need for the CNIC has increased manifold. Almost 
every government and private organization requires CNIC from a 
person before attending them. CNIC is also expedient to get 
admission in higher education programs, apply for a job, open a 
bank account, get a driving license or arms license, get utility 
connections, purchase railway and air tickets, execute any 
instrument, stay in a hotel or lodge, appear in a court proceedings 
and enter in certain buildings and premises etc. CNIC is essential 
for enjoyment of a number of fundamental rights, hence, a person 
cannot be deprived of it without due process. The superior Courts 
have expanded the right to life over time (provided in Article 9 of 
the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973) and 
held that it includes the right to legal aid; the right to speedy trial; 
the right to bare necessities of life; protection against adverse 
effects of electro-magnetic fields; the right to pure and 
unpolluted water; the right to access to justice; the right to 
livelihood; the right to travel; the right to food, water, decent 
environment, education and medical care. Personal identity of a 
person comprises all those aspects of his profile which are 
significant to him. Right to identity is also associated to the right 
to life (Article 9) and would also be read into Article 14, which 
guarantees dignity of man.  
11. 
According to the provisions of Order XXI, Rules 37 C.P.C. 
where an application for the arrest and detention is made, the Court 
instead of issuing warrant for arrest, may issue a notice calling upon 
the judgment-debtor to appear on a date specified in the notice and 
show cause as to why he should not be detained in prison. If the 
judgment-debtor does not appear in response to notice, the Court 
shall issue warrant for the arrest of judgment-debtor as provided 
under Rule 37(2). Rule 40 CPC provides that where the judgment-

 
 
EFA No.26 of 2023 
 
6
debtor appears in the Court in pursuance of the notice or is brought 
before the Court after being arrested, the Court shall hear the 
decree-holder, take all such evidence as may be produced by him in 
support of his application and shall then give judgment-debtor an 
opportunity of showing cause why he should not be detained in 
prison and that pending conclusion of inquiry the Court, in its 
discretion, order to release the judgment-debtor on furnishing of 
security to the satisfaction of the Court for his appearance, when 
required, and that on conclusion of inquiry, the Court can subject to 
the satisfaction of provisions of Section 51, C.P.C., make an order 
in respect of detaining the judgment-debtor in prison. These rules 
and procedure therein have been considered in a number of cases 
and the consistent view taken is that before passing an order for 
arrest and detention of judgment-debtor, the Court shall after due 
inquiry and affording opportunity of evidence to parties, determine 
that the pre-conditions for the issuance of such directive have been 
satisfied by the decree-holder. Reference can be made to Habib 
Ahmad v. Haji Munir Ahmad (2004 YLR 1540), Messrs 3-A Trade 
Impex through Partner and 2 others v. Askari Commercial Bank 
Ltd, through Branch Manager (2005 CLD  1379), Abdul Basit 
Zahid v. Modaraba Al-Tijarah through Chief Executive and 2 
others (PLD 2000 Karachi 322) and Muhammad Kaleem v. 
Arslan Aslam and others (2023 CLC 796).  
12. 
It is pertinent to mention here that agricultural land of the 
judgment-debtors has already been redeemed and another 
agricultural land measuring 195-K 02-M, situated at Mouza Turbet 
Haji Shah, Tehsil & District Jhang, is under mortgage and order 
could have been passed regarding said property as permissible 
under the law, therefore, there appears no justification to pass 
impugned order, especially when prerequisites have not been 
observed.  
13. 
For the foregoing reasons, instant appeal is allowed. 
Consequently, impugned order dated 26.04.2023 is set aside being 

 
 
EFA No.26 of 2023

illegal and without lawful authority. However, learned Executing 
Court shall be at liberty to initiate fresh process as per law and the 
above observations of this Court.
