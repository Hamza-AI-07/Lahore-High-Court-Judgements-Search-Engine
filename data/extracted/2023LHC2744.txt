Petitioners  by: 
Mr. Irfan Ghaus Ghuman, Advocate 
Respondent No. 3 by: 
Rana Ahmad Tayyab Shahid, Advocate 
 
ABID HUSSAIN CHATTHA, J. This consolidated Judgment shall decide 
the titled Writ Petitions since they are directed against the same impugned 
Judgments & Decrees dated 21.01.2016 and 30.09.2016 passed by Judge 
Family Court, Pasrur and Additional District Judge, Pasrur, District Sialkot, 
respectively.  
2. 
For ease of reference, throughout this Judgment, Mst. Aniza shall 
hereinafter be referred to as (the “Petitioner”), Muhammad Awais as (the 
“Minor”) and Nasir Mehmood as (the “Respondent”).  
3. 
Brief facts of this case are that the Petitioner and the Minor instituted 
a suit for recovery of maintenance allowance and dower, whereas, the 
Respondent filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights. After submission of 
contesting written statements, both the suits were tried together and 
consolidated issues were framed. The Family Court after evaluating the 
evidence on record concluded that the Petitioner was the legally wedded 
wife of the Respondent and there was no dispute regarding the paternity of 
the Minor. Accordingly, the Petitioner and the Minor were held entitled to 
receive maintenance allowance @ Rs. 3,000/- and Rs. 6,000/- per month, 
respectively with 10% annual increment from 10.02.2014 till their legal 
entitlement. The suit of the Respondent for restitution of conjugal rights was 

2 
W. P. No. 38446 of 2016 
W. P. No. 35820 of 2016 
 
conditionally decreed subject to payment of maintenance allowance to the 
Petitioner.  
4. 
Importantly, the claim of the Petitioner to recover her dower amount 
of Rs. 500,000/- was declined by the Family Court by relying upon an 
inquiry report dated 01.09.2014 (the “Inquiry Report”) ordered by the 
District Coordination Officer upon an Application filed by the Respondent 
against the Nikah Khuwan. It was held that although the Nikahnama           
(Ex. P-1) was an admitted document yet the particular entry has been 
declared false and frivolous in the Inquiry Report and thus, cannot be 
admitted. Moreover, the disputed dower entry has been inserted in column 
Nos. 13 & 14 which were not relevant columns for listing of dower.   
5. 
The parties preferred cross Appeals against each other against the 
decision of the Family Court. However, both the Appeals were dismissed 
based upon the same premises and reasons. These constitutional Petitions 
were pressed by the parties to the extent of quantum of maintenance 
allowance and the entitlement of the Petitioner to recover dower of Rs. 
500,000/- as per stipulation in the Nikahnama which were couched in issues 
No. 1 and 9(a) framed by the Family Court.  
6. 
Learned counsel for the Petitioner and the Minor submitted that the 
impugned Judgments and Decrees are result of misreading and non-reading 
of evidence on record. The quantum of maintenance allowance was 
inadequate to meet the basic needs of the Petitioner and the Minor and was 
liable to be enhanced on the basis of evidence on record. Further, the 
Petitioner had established her entitlement to receive the dower of Rs. 
500,000/- as it was clearly stipulated in the Nikahnama and the Inquiry 
Report did not conclusively establish that entry to that effect was false. The 
Courts below declined the desired relief based upon assumptions by giving 
precedence to oral evidence over the admitted Nikahnama between the 
parties. Hence, the impugned Judgments are liable to be modified.  
7. 
Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that 
quantum of maintenance allowance was exorbitant and excessive as the 
income of the Respondent at the relevant time was Rs. 30,000/- per month 
and he has also to maintain his mother and sister. Further, the claim of 

3 
W. P. No. 38446 of 2016 
W. P. No. 35820 of 2016 
 
dower of the Petitioner was based on manipulated and false entry in the 
Nikahnama and the same was rightly declined by the Courts below.  
8. 
Arguments heard. Record perused.  
9. 
The impugned Judgments were evaluated in the light of evidence on 
record. The financial status and capacity of the Respondent was duly 
considered by the Courts below while determining the quantum of 
maintenance allowance for the Petitioner and the Minor which was neither 
exorbitant nor excessive or harsh in this era of price hike and inflation. No 
piece of evidence was shown to this Court that was misread or non-read 
while determining the quantum of maintenance allowance and accordingly, 
the concurrent findings rendered by the Courts below to the extent of 
fixation of maintenance allowance are maintained.  
10. 
The real point of determination is regarding the entitlement of the 
Petitioner to recover her claimed dower amount. It was specifically pleaded 
in the plaint that an amount of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500,000/-, respectively was 
fixed as dower at the time of marriage in the Nikahnama in the presence of 
witnesses. It was specifically alleged and prayed that the Petitioner was 
entitled to receive Rs. 500,000/- as dower from the Respondent. Conversely, 
the stance of the Respondent was that at the time of marriage, Rs. 1,000/- 
was fixed as dower which was paid at the spot but later, an entry of Rs. 
500,000/- was inserted in the Nikahnama by the Petitioner and her parents in 
connivance with the Nikah Khuwan, namely, Mukarab Ali. The Respondent 
also filed an Application before the District Coordination Officer which was 
decided in his favour and the license of Mukarab Ali was cancelled.  
11. 
The Petitioner as PW-1 and her witness as PW-2 deposed in line with 
the pleadings of the plaint. The claim of dower was specifically asserted by 
them. It was admitted that entries with respect to dower were not 
incorporated in the relevant columns of the Nikahnama. A suggestion was 
denied to the effect that the entry regarding Rs. 500,000/- was for deferred 
dower. PW-3, Nikah Khuwan entered in the witness box and confirmed the 
fact of Nikah and registration of Nikahnama. He also confirmed that an 
amount of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500,000/- were incorporated in the Nikahnama. 
He deposed that Nikah Registrar had died. The word “deferred” was not 
written anywhere in the Nikahnama. He admitted that he was in possession 

4 
W. P. No. 38446 of 2016 
W. P. No. 35820 of 2016 
 
of two different pens at the time of marriage with blue and black ink. He 
confirmed that the entire document was scribed by him. He deposed that an 
Application was filed against him by the Respondent which was decided in 
his absence.  
12. 
The Respondent appeared as DW-1 and admitted the fact of Nikah 
with the Petitioner and the scribing of Nikahnama in the presence of 
witnesses. However, he denied the entry of Rs. 500,000/- incorporated in the 
Nikahnama. He asserted that the Inquiry Report has been concluded in his 
favour which proves that the disputed entry of dower was false and was 
incorporated subsequently. He was specifically questioned regarding 4 Perts 
of Nikahnama to which he replied that he was not aware of this legal 
requirement. DW-2 admitted that he has executed all 4 Perts of the 
Nikahnama though one Pert was dully filled while the others were blank, 
when he signed the same.  
13. 
The Petitioner and her witness unequivocally deposed regarding the 
entitlement of the Petitioner to receive the dower amount based upon the 
Nikahnama. The Petitioner also produced the Nikah Khuwan who candidly 
deposed that the Nikah was solemnized and all the entries contained therein 
were filled by him including disputed entry of Rs. 500,000/-. After 
discharging the initial onus of proof by the Petitioner regarding her 
entitlement of dower, the burden to prove that disputed entry of dower was 
false or subsequently incorporated in the Nikahnama shifted upon the 
Respondent. He could not produce any evidence to establish his stance taken 
in his written statement but merely relied upon the Inquiry Report to prove 
his version. Importantly, admitted Nikahnama was placed on record as          
Ex. P-1. It clearly stipulates in column No. 16 that Rs. 500,000/- was fixed 
as dower. The word “deferred” is not written therein. Section 10 of the 
Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 stipulates that where no details about 
the mode of payment of the dower are specified in the Nikahnama, the entire 
amount of dower shall be payable on demand. There is no cutting in the said 
entry and it does not look different in writing than the rest of the entries in 
the document to the naked eye. More conspicuously, the Inquiry Report 
relied upon by the Courts below itself states that during inquiry, it transpired 
that a suit on the subject was pending between the parties and as the same 

5 
W. P. No. 38446 of 2016 
W. P. No. 35820 of 2016 
 
was sub judice before the Court of competent jurisdiction, therefore, the 
Respondent was directed to seek his remedy from the concerned forum. 
With the aforesaid advice, mere reference in the Inquiry Report that the 
dower amount of Rs. 500,000/- was subsequently incorporated looses 
significance particularly when the proceedings of the Inquiry Report were 
never brought on record and the Inquiry Officer was not produced as a 
witness for cross-examination. Further, Writ Petition No. 6468 / 2016 was 
filed before this Court against the impugned Inquiry Report which was 
accepted by holding that it was beyond the jurisdiction of the Deputy 
Commissioner to determine the correctness or otherwise of an entry in the 
Nikahnama which was the prerogative of the Family Court. Intra Court 
Appeal No. 474 of 2016 filed against the Order dated 23.05.2016 passed in 
the referred Writ Petition was also dismissed on 20.04.2016. As such, the 
Inquiry Report lost its ground. There was no reason as to why the admitted 
Nikahnama in the shape of documentary proof was not given due weight 
over the oral depositions with respect to the relevant columns of Nikahnama 
especially when the Respondent could not bring on record any other Pert of 
the Nikahnama which was contradictory to Ex. P-1. Hence, the Respondent 
failed to prove that contesting dower entry was false or manipulated.  
14. 
The issue regarding the incorporation of different entries in the 
Nikahnama has been recently dealt with by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in case titled, “Haseen Ullah v. Mst. Naheed Begum and others” 
(PLD 2022 Supreme Court 686). The Apex Court while interpreting the 
entries in column Nos. 13 to 16 of the Nikahnama held as follows:- 
“Needless to say that Nikahnama is a deed of marriage-contract 
entered into between the parties, husband and wife, and the contents 
of its clauses / columns, like clauses of other contracts, are to be 
construed and interpreted in the light of intention of parties.3 The 
High Court has rightly ascertained the intent of the parties for 
mentioning four Kanal agriculture land in column No. 16 of the 
Nikahnama, irrespective of its placement in a particular column. It is 
a matter of common knowledge that the persons who solemnize Nikah 
or the Nikah Registrars are mostly laymen, not well-versed of legal 
complications that may arise from mentioning certain terms agreed to 
between the parties in any particular column of the Nikahnama. 
Therefore, it becomes the foremost duty of courts dealing with 
disputes arising out of the terms entered in the Nikahnama, to 
ascertain the true intent of the parties and give effect thereto 

6 
W. P. No. 38446 of 2016 
W. P. No. 35820 of 2016 
 
accordingly, and not be limited and restricted by the form of the 
heading of the particular columns wherein those terms are 
mentioned.” 
 
15. 
Therefore, it is manifestly evident that the findings of the Courts 
below while denying the amount of dower of Rs. 500,000/-  to the Petitioner 
were clearly result of misreading and non-reading of evidence on record 
which cannot be sustained. 
16. 
In view of the above discussion, Writ Petition No. 38446 of 2016 is 
partially accepted and in consequence thereof, the impugned Judgments & 
Decrees dated 21.01.2016 and 30.09.2016 are modified in the manner that 
the Petitioner is held entitled to recover her dower of Rs. 500,000/- from the 
Respondent, whereas, Writ Petition No. 35820 / 2016 filed by the 
Respondent stands dismissed. The rest of the findings of the Courts below 
are upheld.
