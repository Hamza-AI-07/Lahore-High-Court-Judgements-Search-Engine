For the petitioners 
Barrister Javed Zahid Warraich with minors. 
For Respondent No.1 Syed Muhammad Mehdi Shah, Advocate with 
respondent No.1 in person. 
   
 
 
 
 
Raheel Kamran J:- The petitioners Mirza Waqar 
Ahmad, Zahida alias Zubaida Begum and Zishan Mirza are 
grandfather, grandmother and father respectively while respondent 
No.1 Ayesha Zeeshan is mother of four minors namely Abdur Rehman  
(son), Fatima Zeeshan (daughter), Wajeeha Zeeshan (daughter) and 
Abdur Raheem (son). Respondent No.1 filed an application for custody 
of the minors, which was dismissed by the learned Senior Civil Judge 
(Family Division), Gujrat vide order dated 02.11.2021.  Respondent 
No.1 preferred an appeal, which was partly allowed to entrust her 
custody of the minor daughters, however, order of the trial court was 
maintained to the extent of custody of the minor sons vide judgment 
dated 26.03.2022 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 
Gujrat impugned herein.  
2. 
In the impugned judgement, the learned Additional District 
Judge recorded relevant findings in the following terms: 
“16. 
In the instant matter, through their written reply, the 
respondents have not alleged that the appellant/petitioner has been 

2 
W.P. No.23024 of 2022. 
 
 
 
divorced by the respondent No.3.  Even through affidavits Ex.R-1 
and Ex.R-2, both DW-1 and DW-2 have not deposed about 
pronouncing of divorce by the respondent No.3 to the 
appellant/petitioner.  Even during the cross-examination of the 
appellant/petitioner, the question has not been put to her that she 
has been divorced by the respondent No.3 on 29.08.2019 as 
depicted through photocopy of notice of divorce Mark-DC, whereas 
during her cross-examination, the appellant/petitioner/AW-1 has 
denied the suggestion about her separation from her husband at the 
occasion of estrangement of her relations with her husband two 
years before recording of her cross-examination dated 16.06.2021. 
Thus keeping in view available record, as the appellant/petitioner, 
who is mother of the minors has not contracted a second marriage 
as no oral or written proof thereto has been produced, therefore, 
without dilating upon the question of her alleged divorce, which has 
not to be resolved through this appeal, her right to custody 
(Hizanat) of the minors is to be determined. 
17. 
As per record, there are four minor kids of the 
appellant/petitioner and respondent No.3, out of whom two are 
daughters and two are sons.  According to the contention of the 
appellant/petitioner as taken up in para No.2 of the main petition, 
read with her documentary evidence Mark A to D, at present Mirza 
Abdul Rehman is aged about 14 years, two months and 24 days, 
Mirza Abdur Raheem is aged about six years and 8 months, Fatima 
Zeshan is aged about 12 years and 7 months and 13 days and 
Wajeeha Zeshan is aged about 9 years, 8 months and 8 days.  
Meaning thereby both the minor daughters have not yet attained the 
age of puberty, whereas one son is quite young and the other son is 
about to complete his seven years of age, thus, making the 
appellant/petitioner disentitled for the custody of her sons as 
keeping in view their ages, their welfare does not lie with their 
mother/appellant/petitioner as only male can properly look after 
them whereas the minor daughters at this age require the care and 
custody of their mother/ because no one can be a better guardian 
and custodian of a minor girl than the real mother and in such a 
situation as laid down in 2015 CLC 1260 [Lahore], financial status 
of the father does not give  him any preference over the mother as 
father is sole responsible to cater the needs of his children 
irrespective of their place of residence or custody.  In my view the 
needs of the minors include their lodging, boarding, food and 
education. 
18. 
Moreover, in my view, as per stance of the respondents if 
the atmosphere of house of parents of the appellant/petitioner is not 
conducive or the same is too little to cater of a  large family of 
parents of the appellant/petitioner, then the respondent No.3, who is 
father of the minors, having sound financial position, can manage a 
separate house for the minors girls under the custody of their 
mother of an acceptable atmosphere with all the facilities, but 
merely due to small house of parents of the appellant/petitioner, her 
legal right to the custody of her minor daughters cannot be denied 
to her.

As a result of above observations, this appeal to the extent 
of two minor daughters is partly accepted and to the extent of two 
minor sons is partly dismissed.  The impugned order to the extent of 
two minor daughters is partly set-aside and to the extent of minor 
sons is partly maintained.  The application for custody of minors to 
the extent of two minor daughters is partly accepted and to the 
extent of two minor sons is partly dismissed.  The respondents are 
directed to hand over the custody of two minor daughters to the 
appellant/petitioner forthwith. The parties shall abide by the 
schedule of meeting chalked out by the learned trial Court vice 
versa…..” 
 
3. 
It has been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioners that 
all the four minors have been residing with the petitioners since the 
year 2017 hence they are emotionally attached with them; that the 
learned Appellate Court in the impugned judgment has ignored the 
wishes and willingness of the minor daughters; that the minors are 
being provided best facilities of education, religious teachings and 
other necessities of life and if the custody of minor daughters is handed 
over to respondent No.1 then they shall be deprived of the same; that 
separating the minor daughters from their sibling would cast a bad 
impact on their mental growth and thus, cause an irreparable loss to 
their personality, therefore, by setting aside the impugned judgment, 
custody of the minor daughters be also retained with the petitioners.  
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.1 has supported 
the impugned judgment for the reasons stated therein.  
5. 
Heard. Record perused. 
6. 
Section 17 of the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 requires the Court to 
consider welfare of the minor while appointing a guardian keeping in view 
the age, gender and religion of the minor. Undisputedly, the parties and the 
minors in the instant case are Muslims by faith. In Muhammadan Law, the 
mother is entitled to the custody (Hizanat) of her female children until they 

4 
W.P. No.23024 of 2022. 
 
 
 
attain puberty. In the case of Mst Shaista Naz v. Muhammad Nadeem Admed 
(2004 SCMR 990), the Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the right of 
Hizanat having the force of Injunction of Islam is an accepted principle of 
Islamic Law  and a female, on account of re-marriage may be disqualified to 
exercise this right, but a mother on account of remarriage is not absolutely 
disqualified to be entrusted the custody of a minor child rather she may lose 
her preferential right of custody. In the instant case, the mother (i.e. 
respondent No.1) does not suffer from any legal disability that may 
deprive her of her legal right to have custody of her minor daughters. 
The minor daughters are in tender ages who require proper care and 
attention of their mother. The Supreme Court of Pakistan, while 
emphasizing the status of mothers in Islam and her entitlement to 
custody even with any physical disability, in the case of Mst. Beena vs. 
Raja Muhammad and others (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 508), held 
that:  
“11. 
……………  If a child is taken away from the mother, 
deprived of her love and the benefit of her upbringing the mother 
and the child’s relationship is fragmented. 
12. 
Another of the principles provides that Muslims must be 
enabled to live their lives in accordance with the fundamental 
principles and basic concepts of Islam and to promote unity and 
the observance of the Islamic moral standards.  The religion of 
Islam gives a high status to expectant ladies and mothers.  When 
performing the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, Muslims run 
between the mounts of Safa and Marwah (Sa’ee) in the footsteps 
of the lady Haajar to emulate her when she desperately searched 
for water for her child, Ismail (peace be upon him).  Haajar the 
esteemed mother is commemorated in perpetuity by incorporating 
her actions as an integral component in the performance of Hajj 
and Umrah of the Islamic Faith.  A mother-child bond and a 
mother’s agony instituted a religious obligation, a rare if not the 
only example, in world religions.  The mother of Islam’s progeny, 
lady Haajar is buried next to her son, the Prophet Ismail (peace 
be upon him), in the Hateem, the crescent shaped enclosure 
adjacent to one of the walls of the Holy Ka’ba, also known as Hijr 
Ismail, the shelter constructed by Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon 
him) for his wife and child.  Pilgrims from all over the world 
circumambulate the Holy Ka’ba, including the Hijr/Hateem. 
13. 
The high status of motherhood is reflected in the naming of a 
chapter of the Holy Qu’ran after Maryam (Mary), peace be upon her, 
the only chapter named after a woman.  Almighty Allah recalls her 
qualities and bestows on her a number of titles:  a purified (tahharaki) 

5 
W.P. No.23024 of 2022. 
 
 
 
and chosen (istafagi) one, a sin (ayatan) of God, truthful (siddiqatun) 
and devoutly obedient (qanitina).  The lady Maryam (peace be upon 
her) is mentioned 34 times in the Holy Qur’an.  The mother of the 
Prophet Isa (peace be upon him) faced the pangs of childbirth alone.  
She, like the lady Haajar, overcame formidable odds to care for her 
child.  These great ladies are acknowledged and incorporated into the 
Faith, enriching Islam’s glorious tradition.  It is for believers to ponder 
and reflect upon their lives, and to derive lessons from it.  To be 
financially underprivileged, to be weighed down with a child, to give 
birth or to have a disability is not something to be derided.  For a 
mother to bear the pain of childbirth, the greatest human natural pain, 
but then to have her child wrested away from her on the pretext that she 
is incapable of taking care of the child is insensitive in the extreme, and 
may also be characterized as hypocritical.”   
 
7. 
Petitioners No.1 & 2 are grandparents of the minors who have no 
preferential right to custody of the minors over and above the real mother of 
the minors (i.e. respondent No.1) particularly when she is not suffering from 
any disqualification in law. Therefore, their claim as to custody of the 
minors is worthy of little consideration.  
8. 
Petitioner No.3 is father of the minors who is their natural guardian as 
well. However, law maintains a distinction between custody and 
guardianship and respective rights and obligations in that regard under 
the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890. The definition of ‘guardian’ in 
section 4(2) appears to include the concept of custody, unless the same 
has been exclusively awarded by the court to a party who is not the 
guardian of a minor. Custody under the Act involves a right to 
upbringing of a minor. On the other hand, guardianship entails the 
concept of taking care of the minor even in situations when the 
guardian does not have domain over the corpus of the child. A father 
is considered to be a natural guardian of a minor, since even after 
separation with the mother, and even when the mother has been 
granted custody of a minor, he is obligated to provide financial 
assistance to the minor. The liability to maintain the minor is not only 
religious and moral but legal. The right of custody of minor is 
subordinate to the fundamental principle i.e. welfare of the minor. 
Maintenance of child is the duty of father and the mother cannot be 

6 
W.P. No.23024 of 2022. 
 
 
 
deprived of custody due to her inability to maintain the child for lack 
of resources. Reliance in this regard is placed on the cases of Mst. 
Feroze Begum vs. Lt-Col. Muhammad Hussain (1983 SCMR 606), 
Munawar Bibi vs. Muhammad Amin (1995 SCMR 1206), Mst. Razia 
Bibi vs. Riaz Ahmad and another (2004 SCMR 821) and Mst. Beena 
vs. Raja Muhammad and others (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 508).   
9. 
In the instant case, findings of the Appellate Court that father of 
the minors i.e. petitioner No.3 has contracted  second marriage with a 
foreign national of Moroccan origin who is residing with her in Italy 
are not under challenge in any of the grounds taken in the titled 
petition. Although it has been verbally asserted before this Court by 
the learned counsel for the petitioners that father of the minors runs 
the business of property in Pakistan yet no proof of his any business 
or his income tax return has been produced in evidence. Quite 
contrary to the said assertion, affidavits of Mirza Waqar Ahmad 
(grandfather of the minors) Ex.R-1 and Mst. Zubeda Begum 
(grandmother of the minors)   Ex.R-2 clearly show that their entire 
family is settled in Italy to earn their livelihood. It is thus clearly 
established that father of the minors is permanently residing in Italy 
whereas the minors are living with their grandparents in Pakistan 
and mother of the minors has yet not contracted second marriage. 
Undisputedly, father of the minors has better financial means and 
resources than their mother (i.e. respondent No.1) since he is settled in 
Italy, however, that is not the determining factor in law to adjudicate 
upon custody of the minors. It is noteworthy that father of the minors 
in this case did not personally appear in the witness box to oppose 
claim of respondent No.1 and to establish how entrustment of 
custody to him was indeed in the welfare of the minors. Mother of 
the minors, on the other hand, despite meagre resources available to 
her has been relentlessly pursuing her claim for the custody of the 
minors for a number of years. It has been aptly noted by the 
Appellate Court that the minor daughters in this case are at such 

7 
W.P. No.23024 of 2022. 
 
 
 
tender ages where they require the care and custody of their mother 
because no one can be a better custodian of a minor girl than the real 
mother. It is settled law that mother of the minor girls is entitled to 
their custody unless there is anything available on record to disentitle 
her. Reliance in this regard is placed on judgements in the cases of 
Mst. Tahira vs. Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi and others 
(1990 SCMR 852) and Mir Bat Khan vs. Mst. Shirin Bibi and others 
(2019 SCMR 520). The impugned judgment of the Appellate Court is, 
therefore, quite in accordance with the law.    
10. 
Plea of the petitioners that all the four minors have been 
residing with the petitioners since long hence they are emotionally 
attached with them is not a valid and sufficient consideration to deny 
respondent No.1 of her entitlement to custody of the minor girls in 
their tender ages. Needless to add that such entrustment of custody 
does not place any restriction on the minor boys to meet their sisters 
frequently.  
As regards plea of the petitioners that learned Appellate Court in 
the impugned judgment has ignored the wishes and willingness of the 
minor daughters, suffice it to observe that minor is not always the best 
judge of where his or her welfare lies, as held by the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan in the case of Mst. Aisha vs. Manzoor Hussain and others 
(PLD 1985 Supreme Court 436).  Minor girls in the instant case are 
in their impressionable and tender ages, therefore, it would not be 
appropriate to attach much weight to their wishes in order to determine 
where their welfare in relation to their custody lies. Even otherwise, it 
is to be seen how confident in forming opinion and expressive they are 
without any influence. Undisputedly, the minors have been residing 
with the petitioners for quite some time and not with their mother. The 
minor girls are present in this Court. I asked the elder minor namely 
Fatima Zeeshan aged 14 years a few questions regarding last visit of 
her father to Pakistan, the date of his departure from Pakistan, her last 
overnight stay with her mother, her father’s business in Pakistan, 

8 
W.P. No.23024 of 2022. 
 
 
 
however, she could not provide correct answers leaving behind the 
impression that she is not confident in forming opinion and expressive 
without any influence, therefore, her choice, if any, could not be 
attached much weight for decision on her custody.  
The petitioners’ plea that the minors are being provided best 
facilities of education, religious teachings and other necessities of life 
and if the custody of minor daughters is handed over to respondent 
No.1 then they shall be deprived of the same, is without merit. There is 
no substitute of the natural love, affection and care of the mother 
which the minor girls shall be missing if they are not entrusted in the 
custody of their mother. On the other hand the proposal in paragraph 
No.18 of the impugned judgment, reproduced herein above, provides a 
viable solution to facilitate congenial educational environment at the 
expense of their resourceful father who has legal, moral and religious 
obligation in that regard.  
Finally, as regards plea that separating the minor daughters from 
their sibling would cast a bad impact on their mental growth and thus 
cause an irreparable loss to their personality, suffice it to observe that 
if the minor daughters are deprived of the love, affection and care of  
their real mother, the quantum of loss of their psychological and 
emotional development shall be phenomenally higher in comparison to 
limiting interaction with their brothers, which can be mitigated by 
frequent meetings inter se the minors.   
 
11. 
It is, therefore, in the best interest and welfare of the minor 
daughters that their custody is handed over to their real mother 
forthwith. The impugned judgment of the Appellate Court does not 
suffer from any illegality or jurisdictional error, therefore, the same is 
unexceptionable in so far as custody of the minor girls is concerned. 
Furthermore, it is established that the minor boys are residing with 
their grandparents and not with their father, however, since respondent 
No.1 has not challenged the impugned judgment seeking custody of 

9 
W.P. No.23024 of 2022. 
 
 
 
her minor sons, therefore, I do not deem it appropriate to comment any 
further on that. As far as lack of financial resources with the mother 
are concerned, as observed supra it is obligation of the father to 
maintain his children and respondent No.1 may approach the learned 
Judge Family Court for maintenance of the minors to meet their 
expenses of schooling, lodging, etc. of the minors.   
12. 
During the course of hearing of the titled writ petition on 
29.09.2022, in the apprehension that the minors might be removed 
from Pakistan by the petitioners who admittedly have permanent 
resident visas of Italy, this Court ordered that the minors shall not be 
removed from the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and directed 
the petitioners to deposit their passports with the Deputy Registrar 
(Judicial) of this Court, which order was complied with on 
01.10.2022. Subsequently, through Civil Misc. No.01 of 2023, the 
petitioners have prayed for permission to allow the minors to travel 
to Italy according to the proposed tickets to save their permanent 
resident visas from expiration in order to secure the ends of justice.     
13. 
In the impugned judgment, custody of minor daughters has been 
awarded to respondent No.1 whereas custody of minor boys is to be 
retained by the father/petitioner No.3 with corresponding visitation 
rights.  It has been held by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case 
of Muhammad Nadeem Qadir v. Additional District Judge, Lahore and 
others (2012 SCMR 609) that where children are removed to a place 
outside the jurisdiction of the Court by one parent, such conduct 
amounts to depriving the other parent of exercising his or her visiting 
rights. There is an imminent danger of removal of minors from the 
territorial limits of Pakistan inasmuch as petitioner No.3 is admittedly 
residing and working in Italy and the minors also have Italian 
residence visas. Removal of the minors from the territorial limits 
carries the risk of irreversibly compromising or destroying right of the 
mother to custody of the minor girls and visiting rights of the minor 
boys. In these facts and circumstances, the petitioners cannot be 

10 
W.P. No.23024 of 2022. 
 
 
 
allowed to remove the minors out of the territorial limits of Pakistan 
without leave of the Court, particularly when the same is opposed by 
their mother.   For that purpose, names of the minors are also required 
to be placed in the Exit from Pakistan Control List maintained by the 
Government of Pakistan. Before this Court, mother of the minors i.e. 
respondent No.1 has opposed travel of the minors outside Pakistan. 
The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of this Court shall send a copy of this 
judgment to the Secretary Ministry of Interior for placement of names 
of the minors in this case on the Exit Control List. Passports of the 
minor boys shall be returned to their father and those of the minor girls 
to their mother by the Deputy Registrar (Judicial) after placement of 
the minors’ names in the Exit Control List. C.M.No.01 of 2023 is 
disposed of accordingly. 
14. 
For the foregoing reasons, this writ petition is dismissed being 
devoid of any merit. The petitioners shall hand over the custody of the 
minor daughters peacefully within two weeks and in case they do not 
comply with the same, the Social Welfare Department, Government of 
the Punjab shall ensure that the minor girls are handed over to their 
mother through an officer of the Department.
