Mahnaz Ali son of Nazir Ahmad: 
Death under section 302(b) P.P.C. as Tazir for committing Qatl-i-Amd 
of Memona Bibi daughter of Allah Rakha(deceased) and directed to

The convict was ordered to be hanged by his neck till 
dead. 
Zahoor Ahmad and Mst.Rukhsana Bibi, the co-accused of the convict 
were, both however acquitted by the learned trial court. 
 2. 
 Feeling aggrieved, Mahnaz Ali son of Nazir Ahmad (convict) 
lodged Criminal Appeal No.68 of 2022, assailing his conviction and 
sentence. The learned trial court submitted Murder Reference No.06 of 
2022 under section 374 Cr.P.C. seeking confirmation or otherwise of the 
sentence of death awarded to the appellant namely Mahnaz Ali son of 
Nazir Ahmad. We intend to dispose of the Criminal Appeal No. 68 of 
2022 and Murder Reference No.06 of 2022 through this single judgment. 
3. 
Precisely, the necessary facts of the prosecution case, as narrated by 
Allah Rakha (PW-1), the complainant of the case are as under:- 
“ Stated that my daughter Memona bibi aged 18/19 years was 
married with accused Mahnaz Ali s/o Nazir Ahmad about 3 years 
ago in Chak No.178/M. On 06.10.2019 I alongwith Muhammad 
Irfan son of Muhammad Siddique, Muhammad Yaqoob son of Haji 
Ghulam Rasool went to see my said daughter Memona Bibi in Chak 
No.178/M Tehsil Chishtian. We reached near the house of my said 
daughter at about 12:30 PM (Noon), where we heard the noise of my 
said daughter, whereupon we instantly entered into the house and 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022

saw in the room where accused persons had lay my daughter on the 
cot, accused Rukhsana Bibi wife of Zahoor Ahmad and Zahoor 
Ahmad s/o Dur Muhammad had caught hold from her legs and 
accused Mahnaz Ali present in court had pressed the throat of my 
daughter in order to commit her murder. On seeing this we raised 
hue and cry, upon which PWS Haji Ramzan and Muhammad Iqbal 
sons of Haji Allah Din came at the spot, witnessed the occurrence 
and saw the accused while fleeing away from the place of 
occurrence. We took care of my daughter, but she died at the spot 
 
  
The accused persons committed the instant occurrence for 
the reason that accused Mahnaz Ali had illicit relations with accused 
Mst.Rukhsana Bibi and when my daughter came to know about this 
fact, she forbade them and due to this reason the present accused 
Mahnaz Ali with help of accused Zahoor Ahmad and Mst.Rukhsana 
Bibi committed the murder. Prior to the instant occurrence accused 
Mahnaz Ali used to torture my daughter due to his illicit relations 
with the accused Rukhsana Bibi. 
 
  
After the occurrence local police came at the spot, I 
submitted an application (Exh.PA) against accused Mahnaz Ali 
present in court as well as accused Zahoor Ahmad and 
Mst.Rukhsana Bibi, on the basis of which instant case was 
registered. Complaint Exh.PA bears my signature as Exh.PA/1. The 
present accused Mahnaz Ali as well as accused Zahoor Ahmad and 
Mst.Rukhsana Bibi with common intention committed murder of 
my daughter, they may kindly be dealt with according to law..” 
4.     After the formal investigation of the case report under section 173 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was submitted before the learned 
trial court and the accused were sent to face trial. The learned trial court 
framed the charge against the accused on 25.02.2020, to which the accused 
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 
5. 
The prosecution in order to prove its case got statements of as many 
as ten witnesses recorded. The ocular account of the case was furnished 
by Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2). Fazal Ahmad

07.10.2019 was posted as Woman Medical Officer at the T.H.Q. Hospital, 
Chishtian and on the same day had conducted the post mortem examination 
of the dead body of the deceased namely Memona Bibi daughter of Allah 
Rakha. On conducting the post-mortem examination of the dead body of 
the deceased namely Memona Bibi daughter of Allah Rakha, Dr. Irum

                     “Examination of Neck 
A bruise mark measuring 1 cm starting from below the right ear and

Final Opinion: 
 
Vide  Forensic DNA and Serology analysis report No.PFSA 2019-

received on 31.8.2020. In the light of above mentioned reports, my final 
opinion is as under: 
 
No seminal material was found on item No.1,2,3 and 4, 
therefore, no further DNA analysis (short tandem repeat profiling) was 
conducted on these items. 
As no standard reference sample of suspects were submitted therefore 
no analysis was conducted on items No.1,2,3, 4.1 and 4.2 at this time. 
 
Drugs were not detected in blood in item No.01. 
Histological examination of heart section reveals patent coronaries and 
unremarkable myocardium. The lung section reveals vascular 
congestion and presence of oedematous fluid inside alveoli. The 
stomach, small and large intestinal sections reveal that no pathological 
changes. The renal section, reveals vascular congestion and presence of 
hemorrhages inside renal tissue. The uterine section reveal attach 
decidual tissue with endometrial wall. Histological examination of

multiple sections from hyoid bone reveals bone entrapped in those are 
blood hemorrhages derioting ante-mortem injury to hyoid bone. These 
features suggest interference at the level of neck causing asphyxias 
death. 
  
In the light of postmortem examination and expert opinion from 
PFSA Lahore, I was of the opinion that cause of death in this case was 
asphyxia/strangulation.” 
 
7.    
 On 22.01.2021, the learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor 
gave up the prosecution witnesses namely Muhammad Irfan, Muhammad 
Ramzan, Muhammad Iqbal, Haji Atim and Sarfraz Ahmad 513/C as being 
unnecessary and closed the prosecution evidence after tendering in 
evidence the reports of Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh. 
P.K, Exh.PL, Exh.PM and Exh.PN). 
8. 
After the closure of prosecution evidence, the learned trial court 
examined the appellant namely Mahnaz Ali son of Nazir Ahmad under 
section 342 Cr.P.C. and in answer to the question why this case against 
you and why the P.Ws. have deposed against you, he replied that he had 
been involved in the case falsely and was innocent. The appellant namely 
Mahnaz Ali son of Nazir Ahmad opted not to get himself examined under 
section 340(2) Cr.P.C. and did not adduce any evidence in his defence.  
9. 
On the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional Sessions 
Judge, Chishtian convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred to 
above.   
10. 
The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant precisely is 
that the whole case is fabricated and false and the prosecution remained 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
8 
 
unable to prove the facts in issue and did not produce any unimpeachable, 
admissible and relevant evidence. Learned counsel for the appellant further 
contended that the story of the prosecution mentioned in the statements of 
the witnesses, on the face of it, was highly improbable. Learned counsel 
for the appellant further contended that the statements of the prosecution 
witnesses were not worthy of any reliance. The learned counsel for the 
appellant also argued that the appellant had been involved in the 
occurrence due to suspicion alone. The learned counsel for the appellant 
finally submitted that the prosecution had totally failed to prove the case 
against the accused beyond the shadow of a doubt.   
11. 
On the other hand, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General 
contended that the prosecution had proved its case beyond the shadow of 
a doubt by producing independent witnesses. The learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General further argued that the deceased died as a result of 
injuries suffered at the hands of the appellant. The learned Deputy 
Prosecutor General further contended that the medical evidence also 
corroborated the statements of Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2). The learned Deputy Prosecutor General contended that 
there was no occasion for the prosecution witnesses, who were related to 
the deceased, to substitute the real offender with the innocent in this case. 
Lastly, the learned Deputy Prosecutor General prayed for the rejection of 
the appeal. 
12. 
We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned 
Deputy Prosecutor General and with their able assistance, perused the 
record and evidence recorded during the trial. 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022

13. 
The whole prosecution case revolves around the statements of Allah 
Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2), the eye witnesses of the 
occurrence. The relationship of the said witnesses with the deceased is on 
record. Mamoona Bibi (deceased) was the real daughter of Allah Rakha 
(PW-1) and the paternal cousin of Muhammad Yqoob (PW-2). In his 
statement before the learned trial court, the prosecution witness namely 
Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) stated as under:- 
“Complainant Allah Rakha is my paternal uncle.. ” 
The prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2) were also admittedly not the residents of the place of 
occurrence. According to the prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2), the prosecution witness namely 
Allah Rakha (PW-1) was the resident of the city of Lahore  and the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) was the resident 
of Basti Jhurran-wali, Mauza Qazi Wala, Tehsil & District Bahawalnagar, 
whereas the occurrence had taken place at Chak 178/M, which place was 
admittedly at a distance from the  places of residences of Allah Rakha 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2). The prosecution witness namely 
Allah Rakha (PW-1), during cross-examination, stated as under:- 
“I work at Lahore as labourer for the last 10/15 years. 
………….. 
I alongwith said two sons used to work in Muddle Textile Mills Lahore. 
My sons are having education i.e. 7/8 Classes. I am working as 
Laboratory Supervisor in the above said Mills. 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
10 
 
……………. 
Muhammad, Yaqoob PW is grandson of my paternal aunt. Muhammad 
Irfan PW is resident of Tensil FortAbbas and his residence is 70 
kilometer away from the place of occurrence. Muhammad Yaqoob is 
resident of Basti Raanwan Tehsil Bahawalnagar, which is about 60 
kilometers away from the place of occurrence.” (emphasis supplied). 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2), during 
cross-examination, stated as under:- 
“Allah Rakha Complainant and his sons work at Lahore separately at 
different places. 
…………… 
My residence is at a distance of about 45 kilometers away from the 
place of occurrence. 
………….. 
It is correct that none from the sons of the complainant is witness of 
the case for the reason that they used to work at Lahore in some 
Factory.” (emphasis supplied)  
It is an admitted fact that both the prosecution witnesses namely Allah 
Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) did not have their 
residences or their places of employment near or around the place of 
occurrence. In this manner, both the prosecution witnesses namely Allah 
Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) can be validly termed as 
“chance witnesses” and therefore were under a bounden duty to provide a 
convincing reason for their presence at the place of occurrence, at the time 
of occurrence and were also under a duty to prove their presence by 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
11 
 
producing some physical proof of the same. We have noted with grave 
concern that the prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) failed miserably to provide any consistent 
evidence as to the reason for their arrival at the place of occurrence and 
their presence at the place of occurrence , when the same was taking place. 
Both the prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) did not even make an effort to explain as to 
why, on the very day of occurrence, they found it necessary to visit the 
matrimonial house of the deceased. Moreover, no effort was made by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2) to explain as to how and when and where the prosecution 
witness namely Muhammad Yqoob (PW-2)  joined the prosecution witness 
namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) on their journey towards the place of 
occurrence, as the prosecution witness namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) was 
residing at Lahore  when the occurrence took place , whereas the 
prosecution witness namely Muhammad Yqoob (PW-2) was residing at 
Basti Jhurran-wali, Mauza Qazi Wala Tehsil & District Bahawalnagar, 
both places being substantially away from each other as well as the place 
of occurrence . We have also noted that though it was admitted by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2) that the place of occurrence was at quite a distance from 
their residences, however, during the course of the investigation as well as 
before the learned trial court, the prosecution witnesses namely Allah 
Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2)  did not mention as to the 
vehicle used by them to arrive at the place of occurrence. Necessarily the 
prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
12 
 
Yaqoob (PW-2) would have used some vehicle  to travel the said distance 
however, the prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) did not give any evidence in this regard and 
did not state as to how they had travelled to arrive at the place of 
occurrence . Majid Iqbal, SI (PW-7) , the Investigating Officer of the case, 
also admitted that the prosecution witness namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) did 
not produce any documentary evidence to prove that he had taken leave 
from the place of his work on the day of occurrence. Majid Iqbal, SI (PW-
7) , the Investigating Officer of the case , during cross-examination , stated 
as under:- 
“It is correct that witness Muhammad Irfan is resident of Tehsil 
FortAbbas, whereas witness Muhammad Yaqoob is resident of Tehsil 
Bahawalnagar.  
……….. 
Complainant did not produce any leave certificate before me during 
investigation. ” (emphasis supplied)  
In this manner, both the eye witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) failed miserably to establish the reason for 
their presence at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence and the 
mode through which they arrived at the place of occurrence. We have also 
noted with concern that the prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) were not mentioned as the 
witnesses who were present at the place of occurrence when the 
Investigating Officer of the case , prepared the inquest report (Exh.PG/1-

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
13 
 
2). Majid Iqbal, SI (PW-7) , the Investigating Officer of the case , admitted 
during cross-examination as under:- 
“Fazal Ahmad and Haji Atim are not witnesses of the instant FIR, who 
are mentioned as witnesses of recovery of last worn clothes of deceased 
as well as identification of body ” 
The prosecution was under a bounden duty to establish not only that the 
prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2) had a reason to proceed to the place of occurrence but also 
to prove the mode through which the prosecution witnesses namely Allah 
Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) arrived at the place of 
occurrence. The very inception of the prosecution case is put in doubt due 
to the said failure of the prosecution. The failure of the prosecution to prove 
the said facts has vitiated our trust in Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2) as being truthful witnesses. Reliance is placed on the case 
of “Muhammad Rafiq v. State” (2014 SCMR 1698) wherein the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan rejected the claim of witnesses who lived one 
kilometer away from the place of occurrence, but on the day of occurrence 
stated to be present near the spot as they were working as labourers, 
inasmuch as they failed to give any detail of the projects they were working 
on. Reliance is also placed on the case of “Usman alias Kaloo v. State” 
(2017 SCMR 622) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan held that 
the ocular account of the incident had been furnished by Zahoor Ahmad, 
Ghulam Farid and Manzoor Ahmed in the said case ,who were all residents 
of some other houses and they were not the inmates of the house wherein 
the occurrence had taken place and therefore the said eye-witnesses were, 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
14 
 
thus, chance witnesses and declared not worthy of reliance. Reliance is 
also placed on the case of “Nasrullah alias Nasro v. The State” (2017 
SCMR 724) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as 
under:- 
“In the case in hand the eye-witnesses produced by the 
prosecution lived eighty kilometers away from the scene of the 
crime, their stated reason for presence in the house of 
occurrence at the time of incident in issue had never been 
established through any independent evidence.” 
 
14. 
 We have also observed that the prosecution witnesses namely Allah 
Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) claimed that the 
occurrence took place exactly at the same time when they had arrived at 
the place of occurrence. This narrative of the prosecution witnesses that 
the accused kept waiting for the arrival of the witnesses at the place of 
occurrence and thereafter committed the same is unnatural and cannot be 
believed. It is opposed to human conduct that an assailant would keep 
waiting for the arrival of the witnesses prior to the commission of the 
offence. It is all the more illogical that being perceptive of the fact that by 
pending the matter the accused ran the risk of the arrival of the witnesses 
and them deposing against the accused, even then the assailant kept 
waiting for their arrival. Such behaviour on the part of the accused, as 
deposed by the prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2), runs counter to natural human conduct and 
behaviour. Hence, being perceptive of this strain of human conduct, we are 
holding that the prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) were not present at the time of occurrence, at 
the place of occurrence and had not witnessed the occurrence. In this 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
15 
 
regard reliance is placed on the case of “STATE through Advocate-
General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar Vs. HASSAN JALIL and 
others” (2019 S C M R 1154) wherein the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan held as under:- 
“Arrival of Noor Seema, PW at venue exactly at a point of time when 
the respondent allegedly did away with the deceased, in itself is a 
circumstance that reflects on the very genesis of the prosecution case.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Muhammad Imran Vs. The State”  
(2020 S C M R 857) wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan held 
as under:- 
“These contradictions, viewed in the retrospect of arrival of the 
witnesses exactly at a point of time when the petitioner started 
inflicting blows to the deceased with their inability to apprehend 
him without there being any weapon to keep them effectively at bay, 
cast shadows on the hypothesis of their presence during the fateful 
moments. It was an odd hour of night without any source of light as 
admitted by no other than Fazal Abbas (PW-4) himself.” 
 
15.        We have also noted that the alleged eye witnesses namely Allah 
Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) alongwith Muhammad 
Irfan (given  up prosecution witness) made no effort either to save the 
deceased or to apprehend the accused when they were three in number and 
could have easily restrained the accused. It is unnatural and unbelievable 
that the alleged eye witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) alongwith Muhammad Irfan (given  up 
prosecution witness), did not even move a limb to protect their near and 
dear one, despite the fact that the appellant was not even armed with any 
weapon, rather according to the prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha 
(PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) , the appellant was present at the 
place of occurrence empty handed. The alleged eye witnesses namely 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
16 
 
Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) alongwith 
Muhammad Irfan (given  up prosecution witness), also allowed the 
appellant to escape from the place of occurrence .No person having 
ordinary prudence would believe that such closely related witnesses would 
remain watching the proceedings as mere spectators for as long as the 
occurrence continued without doing anything to rescue the deceased or to 
apprehend the assailant. It only proves that the deceased was at the mercy 
of the assailant and no one was there to save her. Such behaviour, on the 
part of the witnesses, runs counter to natural human conduct and 
behaviour. Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 allows the courts to 
presume the existence of any fact, which it thinks likely to have happened, 
regard being had to the common course of natural events and human 
conduct in relation to the facts of the particular case. We thus trust the 
existence of this fact, by virtue of the Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 
1984, that the conduct of the witnesses, as deposed by them, was opposed 
to the common course of natural events, human conduct and that the 
prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2) were not present at the place of occurrence, at the time of 
occurrence and their presence was procured subsequently. The august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan has enunciated binding principles for 
appreciation of evidence in such circumstances. Reliance is placed on the 
case of “Zulifqar Ali v. The State” (2021 S C M R 1373) wherein the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:- 
“Though the human response/reaction, in a sudden crisis, particularly 
one striking awe and terror, cannot be gauged or assessed with any 
degree of empirical certainty as fear impacts differently upon faculties

of the onlookers, nonetheless, despite maximum latitude, in the given 
scenario, it really appears hard for the appellant who operated with 
impunity in the face of heavy presence of the witnesses; deceased being 
herself "a young female with average-built" could not be expected a 
static target offering no resistance. Razor (P-13), commonly used by 
the barbers, given its moving handle instead of a fixed grip, is an 
instrument to be managed with some difficultly against a moving 
object; it risks the handler more than the intended target and as such 
unless the victim is stunned as a stone, a possibility beyond 
contemplation for the witnesses standing nearby to foil the attempt; 
they included three able-bodied males in their youth; their inaction is 
mindboggling and explanation far from being plausible, circumstances 
that in retrospect insinuate their absence at the scene” 
Reliance is placed on the case of “Pathan v. The State” (2015 SCMR 315) 
at page 317 wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as 
under:- 
“The causing of such large number of injuries one after another to the 
deceased with scissors must have consumed reasonable time due to the 
pause in between the first injury and the last one but all the three P.Ws. 
including the son with a strong stature and built remained as silent 
spectators. They did not react or showed any response when the 
accused was causing the injuries. No man on the earth would believe 
that a close relative would remain silent spectator in a situation like 
this because their intervention was very natural to rescue the deceased 
but they did nothing nor attempted to chase the accused and apprehend 
him at the spot.” 
Further reliance is placed on the case of “Shahzad Tanveer v. The State” 
(2012 SCMR 172) at page-176 wherein the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan observed as infra:- 
“It is also more strange that none of the P.Ws. dared to physically 
intervene in order to save the victim or apprehend the accused at the 
spot.”  
Reliance is also placed on the case of “Liaquat Ali v. The State” (2008 
SCMR 95) at page 97 wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan 
observed as under: 
“He was a single alleged assailant and if the witnesses were there at 
the spot they could have easily overpowered him. This makes their 
presence at the spot doubtful.”

We have noted with serious anxiety that the ocular account 
of the occurrence as furnished by the prosecution witnesses namely Allah 
Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) is inconsistent with the 
medical evidence as furnished by Dr. Irum Zafar (PW-8)  and flawed 
beyond mending , resulting in disfiguring the complexion of the whole 
prosecution case beyond reparation and recognition. According to the 
statements of the prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2), they had seen the appellant namely Mahnaz 
Ali, pressing the neck of the deceased with his hands and kept pressing the 
same till the deceased died, however, Dr. Irum Zafar (PW-8), on 
examining the dead body of  Memona Bibi (deceased) observed a bruise 
mark measuring 1 cm, starting from below the right ear and anteriorly 
crossing the right thyroid cartilage, running towards the left ear posteriorly 
and also noted that the anterior part the bruise was more thick, alongwith 
crescent shaped, small sized bruises, present more prominently on the right 
side of the neck. Dr. Irum Zafar (PW-8), on examining the dead body of  
Memona Bibi (deceased), gave her   opinion with regard to the manner in 
which the neck of the deceased was pressed , as under:- 
“ The neck may be pressed with rope in this case.” 
The prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2) made a contrary statement to the opinion of Dr. Irum Zafar 
(PW-8) and did not state that any rope had been used to press the neck of 
the deceased or that they had seen the appellant using a rope during the 
occurrence. In Chapter 20 ‘Deaths from Asphyxia ”, from page 515 to page 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022

517 of Rai Bahadur Jaising P. Modi's A Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence 
and Toxicology (26th  Edition 2018) Strangulation has been defined as the 
compression of the neck by a force other than hanging and when 
constriction is produced by the pressure of the fingers and palms upon the 
throat, it is called as throttling. It has been further noted that if fingers are 
used for throttling, marks of pressure by the thumb and the finger 
prints are found on the either side of the neck. In Chapter 20 ‘Deaths 
from Asphyxia”, at page 515 of Rai Bahadur Jaising P. Modi's A Textbook 
of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology (26th Edition 2018), the types 
of strangulation have been mentioned as under:- 
“                   Types of Strangulation 
. Ligature strangulation 
. Throttling (manual strangulation-compressing with hand) • 
Mugging (compressing with forearm or foot or wrist) 
• Bansdola (wooden stick is used to compress the neck) • 
Garrotting (a rope or a loincloth and a wooden stick as a lever to 
tighten the ligation is used) 
• Accidental strangulation (can arise in the course of a person's 
occupation when a neck tie or scarf is caught in moving 
machinery or belts as in mill workers or in an epileptic or an 
intoxicated person who may be helpless in extricating himself 
from such tight encirclement of the neck or in utero when the 
movements of the foetus cause the umbilical cord to be wound 
round into neck.” 
In the same Chapter 20 ‘Deaths from Asphyxia ”, from page 516 to page 
517 of Rai Bahadur Jaising P. Modi's A Textbook of Medical 
Jurisprudence and Toxicology (26th  Edition 2018) it has been discoursed 
as under:- 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
20 
 
“(2) If fingers are used (throttling), marks of pressure by the 
thumb and the fingertips are usually found on either side of the 
windpipe. The thumb mark is ordinarily higher and wider on one 
side of the front of the neck, and the finger marks are situated on 
its other side obliquely downwards and outwards, and one below 
the other. However, the marks are sometimes found clustered 
together, so that they cannot be distinguished separately. These 
fingertip bruises, each disc-shaped and 1-2 cm in diameter, look 
like red bruises (six penny bruises) if examined soon after death, 
but they look brown, dry and parchment-like sometimes death. 
One should refrain from drawing inference from the direction of 
curved abrasion, as to how the hand of the assailant might have 
been applied to the neck of victim. The inherent quality of the 
victim's skin, the shape, and length of the fingernails of the 
assailant render such inferences extremely tenuous. This linear 
or crescentic marks produced by the fingernails are occasionally 
present, if the fingertips are pressed deeply into the soft tissues 
of the neck. A body, which is wet, may not reveal fingernail 
marks until drying of the skin of the body. When both hands are 
used to grasp and compress the throat, the thumb mark of one 
hand and the finger marks of the other hand are usually found on 
either side of the throat. Sometimes, both thumb marks are found 
on one side and several finger marks on the opposite side. If the 
throat is compressed between two hands, one being applied to 
the front and the other to the back, bruises and abrasions may be 
found on the front of the neck, as well as on its back. 
Besides these marks, there may be abrasions and bruises on the 
mouth, nose, cheeks, forehead, lower jaw or any other part of the 
body, if there has been a struggle. Similarly, fractures of the ribs 
and injuries to the thoracic and abdominal organs may be

Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
21 
 
present, if the assailant kneels on the chest or abdomen of his 
victim while pressing his throat” 
As narrated above, had the deceased been throttled in the manner as stated 
by the prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2)  then Dr. Irum Zafar (PW-8) must have observed the 
evidence of marks of pressure by the thumb and the fingertips, fingertip 
bruises, linear or crescentic marks produced by the fingernails, abrasions 
and bruises on and around the neck of the dead body of the deceased , 
however she did not. Therefore, the oral account of the occurrence, as 
given by prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and 
Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) , cannot be said to be  in accordance with the 
medical evidence, rather is proved to be contrary to it. 
17.         It is also a fact of the prosecution case that according to the report 
of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PL) a rope was also 
sent to it for analysis, however, no DNA Profile of the appellant was 
obtained from the same. When an individual touches an object, epithelial 
cells are left behind. Touch DNA is also known as epithelial DNA. The 
same traditional DNA analysis procedures are used to analyze and examine 
these remaining epithelial cells as are used to analyze and examine bodily 
fluids. The amount left behind is often less than 100 picograms and is also 
called low copy DNA. This is evidence with “no visible staining that would 
likely contain DNA resulting from the transfer of epithelial cells from the 
skin to an object. Due to development, lower amounts of human DNA can 
be detected and, possibly, a full or partial STR profile can be generated. 
DNA evidence has emerged as a powerful tool to identify perpetrators of 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
22 
 
unspeakable crimes and to exonerate innocent individuals accused of 
similarly heinous actions. The technology has  advanced to Polymerase 
Chain Reaction (PCR) based short tandem repeat (STR) testing. This 
system multiplies a single copy of a DNA segment to allow for the analysis 
of the genetic makeup of a small sample.  Current analysis makes it 
possible to determine whether a biological tissue matches a suspect with 
near certainty. DNA is comprised of “coding” and “non-coding regions. 
The loci examined are found on “junk DNA,” which are segments of the 
DNA not known to code for any specific trait, but known to be different 
between individuals. “Junk DNA” are the non-coding regions which 
contain valuable information about identity, but do not contain information 
regarding coding for other genetic traits. This allows the development of a 
DNA profile without an examination into other genetic markers. The report 
of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore (Exh.PL) supports the 
claim of the appellant that he was innocent for the reason that had the 
appellant handled the rope then his DNA profile must had been obtained 
from the said rope because had he touched the said rope, then the epithelial 
cells from the skin of the appellant must have been left behind on the rope 
handled by him and subsequently the presence of DNA profile of the 
appellant would have been identified on the said rope handled by him by 
the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore .  The absence of any DNA 
profile of the appellant on the rope sent to the Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore for DNA analysis creates further doubt regarding the 
involvement of the appellant in the occurrence .

18.      Another aspect of the case raising doubt over the presence of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2) at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence, is the 
fact the matter was reported to the police on 06.10.2019 at 09.30 p.m.,  
when the prosecution witness namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) submitted the 
written application (Exh.PA) to  Majid Iqbal, SI (PW-7)  , the Investigating 
Officer of the case, whereas the occurrence had taken place on 06.10.2019 
at 12.30 p.m. In this manner, the delay in reporting the matter to the police 
was of about nine hours, for which delay no reason, much less plausible, 
was offered. No justification, much less credible, has been given by the 
prosecution at any stage for such deferral in reporting the matter to the 
police and the delay in submitting the written application  (Exh. P.A.) by 
Allah Rakha (PW-1) to Majid Iqbal, SI (PW-7). The reason for this 
inordinate delay in reporting the matter to the police by the prosecution 
witness namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) is obvious, being that both the 
prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2) were not present at the place of occurrence, at the time of 
occurrence and the delay was used to procure their attendance. The 
prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2) even admitted that the police arrived at the place of 
occurrence as early as at about 06.00 p.m, however, the written application 
(Exh.PA) was submitted at 09.30 p.m. The prosecution witness namely 
Allah Rakha (PW-1) , during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“ Police reached at the place of occurrence at about 06:00PM.” 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
24 
 
The prosecution witness namely Muhammad Yqoob (PW-2) also admitted 
during cross-examination , stated as under:- 
“Police reached at the place of occurrence at about 06:00 PM ” 
 Majid Iqbal, SI (PW-7) , the Investigating Officer of the case , also 
admitted that the case was registered after substantial delay. Majid Iqbal, 
SI (PW-7), the Investigating Officer of the case , during cross-examination, 
stated as under:- 
“ It is correct that FIR was registered with delay of 10 hours from the 
time of occurrence.” (emphasis supplied)  
 In this case, the ocular account furnished is suffering from legal and 
factual infirmities and does not appeal to a prudent mind, much less a legal 
one, because the witnesses never reported the matter to the police for as 
many as nine hours. This inordinate delay in reporting the matter 
conclusively proves that the written application   (Exh. P.A.) submitted by  
Allah Rakha (PW-1)  and the formal F.I.R (Exh.PA/2) were prepared after 
probe, consultation, planning, investigation and discussion and as the 
prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2) were not present at the place of occurrence, at the time of 
occurrence, the delay was used for procuring their arrival. As many as nine 
hours were taken to invent a false and dishonest narrative of the written 
application  (Exh. P.A.) of Allah Rakha (PW-1). The scrutiny of the 
statements of the prosecution witnesses reveals that the written application  
(Exh. P.A.) of Allah Rakha (PW-1) was neither prompt nor spontaneous 
nor natural, rather was a contrived, manufactured and a compromised 
document. Sufficient doubts have arisen and inference against the 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
25 
 
prosecution has to be drawn in this regard and the delay in reporting the 
matter to the police and the failure of the prosecution witnesses to proceed 
to the Police Station evidences their absence at the time of occurrence, at 
the place of occurrence. Reliance is placed on the case of “Ghulam Abbas 
and another v. The State and another” (2021 SCMR 23) wherein the 
august Supreme Court of Pakistan observed as under:- 
“As per contents of F.I.R., the occurrence in this case took place on 
19.06.2008 at 01.40 a.m. and the matter was reported to the Police on 
the same morning at 07.00 a.m. and as such there is a delay of more 
than five hours in reporting the crime to the Police whereas Police 
Station was situated at a distance of just six kilometers from the place 
of occurrence. No explanation whatsoever was furnished by the 
complainant for this delay in reporting the crime to the Police. Hameed 
Ullah Khan SI (PW.15) who investigated the case stated during his 
cross-examination that he reached at the place of occurrence at about 
05.00 a.m. and he had completed the police proceedings by 06.30 p.m. 
In the circumstances, chances of deliberations and consultations before 
reporting the matter to the Police cannot be ruled out.” 
Reliance is also placed on the case of  “MUHAMMAD ASHRAF JAVEED 
and another vs. MUHAMMAD UMAR and others” (2017 SCMR 199) 
wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was pleased to hold as 
under: 
“The hospital is closely situated to the Police Station but neither the 
complainant nor P.W.s took a little pain to report the matter, nor the 
staff of the hospital including the treating doctor took initiative.” 
Guidance is also sought from the principle enunciated by the august 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Zafar vs. The State  and others” 
(2018 SCMR 326) where the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was 
pleased to hold as under:- 
 “It has been observed by us that the occurrence in this case as per 
prosecution took place on 03.09.1999 at 3.00 a.m. (later half of night) 
and the matter was reported to the police on the same day at 8.30 a.m. 
i.e. after five hours and thirty minutes of the occurrence. The distance 
between the place of occurrence and the police station is 09 miles. The 
postmortem on the dead body of deceased was conducted on the same 
day at 2.00 p.m. i.e. after 11 hours of the occurrence. No explanation 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
26 
 
whatsoever has been given by the complainant Shahadat Ali (PW5) and 
Umer Daraz (PW6) in the F.I.R. or while appearing before the learned 
trial Court qua the delay in lodging the F.I.R. or for that matter the 
belated postmortem of the deceased.” 
Guidance is sought from the principles enunciated by the august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan in the cases of “G. M. NIAZ Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 
506), “Abdul Jabbar and another Vs. The State” (2019 S C M R 129) and 
“Muhammad Shafi alias Kuddoo Vs.  The State and others” (2019 S C M 
R 1045).  
19. 
We have also noted with disquiet that despite the fact that the 
occurrence took place at about 12.30 p.m on 06.10.2019, the post-mortem 
examination of the dead body of the deceased was conducted after much 
delay. According to Dr. Irum Zafar (PW-8), she conducted the post-
mortem examination of the dead body of the deceased namely Memoona 
Bibi at 07.30 a.m on 07.10.2019 i.e. after nineteen hours of the 
occurrence and after ten  hours of the submission of the written 
application  (Exh. P.A.) of Allah Rakha (PW-1) to Majid Iqbal, SI (PW-
7). Dr. Irum Zafar (PW-8) , who conducted the post-mortem examination 
of the dead body of Memoona Bibi (deceased) and prepared the post-
mortem examination report (Exh. PH/1-7), gave the time between death 
and post-mortem examination as being twenty hours. The reason which 
is apparent for the delayed conducting of the post-mortem examination of 
the dead body of Memona Bibi daughter of Allah Rakha(deceased) is that 
by that time the details of the occurrence were not known and the said time 
was used not only to procure the attendance of the witnesses but also to 
fashion a false narrative of the occurrence. No explanation was offered to 
justify the said delay in receiving the complete documents from the police 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
27 
 
and the delay in conducting the post-mortem examination. Furthermore, it 
was also not explained by the prosecution why the dead body was not sent 
to the hospital for as many as fifteen hours after the occurrence, as the dead 
body was received at the hospital on 07.10.2019 at 03.00 a.m. Dr. Irum 
Zafar (PW-8) explained during cross-examination , as under:- 
“ It is correct that I have mentioned the time between death and 
postmortem as within 20 hours. 
…………. 
The dead body was produced at about 03:00 AM, no police papers were 
submitted alongwith the dead body. Police papers were provided to 
me at 06:15 AM.” (emphasis supplied)  
These facts clearly establish that the witnesses claiming to have seen the 
occurrence were not present at the time of occurrence and the delay in the 
post-mortem examination was used to procure their attendance and 
formulate a dishonest account, after consultation and planning. It has been 
repeatedly held by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan that such delay 
in the post-mortem examination is reflective of the absence of witnesses 
and the sole purpose of causing such delay is to procure the presence of 
witnesses and to further advance a false narrative to involve any person. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Khalid alias Khalidi 
and two others vs. The State” (2012 SCMR 327) has held as under: 
“The incident in the instant case took place at 2.00 a.m, F.I.R. 
was recorded at 4/5 a.m, Doctor Muhammad Pervaiz medically 
examined the injured person at 4.00 a.m. but conducted the 
post mortem examination of the deceased at 3.00 p.m i.e. after 
about ten hours, which fact clearly shows that the F.I.R. was not 
lodged at the given time”. 
 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
28 
 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Mian SOHAIL 
AHMED and others vs. The State and others” (2019 SCMR 956) has held 
as under: 
“According to the Doctor (PW-10), who did the post-mortem 
examination, the dead-body of the deceased was brought to the 
mortuary at 11:15 a.m. on 01.9.2006 and the post-mortem 
examination took place at 12 noon after a delay of 15 hours. This 
delay in the post-mortem examination, when the occurrence was 
promptly reported at 8:45 p.m. and formal F.I.R. was registered 
at 9.00 p.m. on 31.8.2006 gives rise to an inference that the 
incident was not reported as stated by the prosecution” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Rafique 
alias Feeqa vs. The State” (2019 SCMR 1068) has held as under: 
“More importantly, the only person who can medically examine 
the dead body during the said police custody of the dead body is 
the medical officer, and that too, when the same is handed over 
to him by the police for its examination. For the purposes of the 
present case, it is crucial to note that, at the time of handing over 
a dead body by the police to the medical officer, all reports 
prepared by the investigating officer are also to be handed over 
in order to assist in the examination of the dead body. 
10. 
Thus, once there is suspicion regarding the death of a 
person, the following essential steps follow: firstly, there is a 
complete chain of police custody of the dead body, right from 
the moment it is taken into custody until it is handed over to the 
relatives, or in case they are unknown, then till his burial; 
secondly, post mortem examination of a dead person cannot be 
carried out without the authorization of competent police 
officer or the magistrate; thirdly, post mortem of a deceased 
person can only be carried out by a notified government 
Medical Officer; and finally, at the time of handing over the 
dead body by the police to the Medical Officer, all reports 
prepared by the investigating officer are also to be handed over 
to the said medical officer to assist his examination of the dead 
body. 
11. 
It is usually the delay in the preparation of these police 
reports, which are required to be handed over to the medical 
officer along with the dead body, that result in the 
consequential delay of the post mortem examination of the 
dead person. To repel any adverse inference for such a delay, 
the prosecution has to provide justifiable reasons therefor, 
which in the present case is strikingly wanting.” 
 
20.      The learned Deputy Prosecutor General has also relied upon the 
evidence of motive and submitted that it corroborated the ocular account. 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
29 
 
The motive of the occurrence as stated by Allah Rakha (PW-1) in his 
written application  (Exh. P.A.) was that the deceased came to know about 
the illicit relations of the appellant with Mst.Rukhsana Bibi(since acquitted 
by the learned trial court), the co-accused of the appellant and therefore, 
the appellant not only initially exacted violence upon the deceased but 
subsequently also murdered her . We have perused the statements of the 
prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2) and find that they failed to prove the motive of the 
occurrence as stated by them. It is even otherwise absurd to believe that 
Zahoor Ahmad(since acquitted by the learned trial court), the husband of 
Mst. Rukhsana Bibi, would have joined her  during the occurrence to 
commit the murder of the wife of a person, in this case the appellant , who 
was having illicit relations with his wife, as has been stated by the 
prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) and Muhammad 
Yaqoob (PW-2). Furthermore, the prosecution witness namely Allah 
Rakha (PW-1) admitted that during the course of the investigation he made 
a statement in favour of both Zahoor Ahmad and Rukhsana Bibi (both 
since acquitted), the co-accused of the appellant and during cross-
examination stated as under:- 
“It is correct that I exonerated accused Zahoor Ahmad and 
Mst.Rukhsana Bibi.” 
 The Investigating Officer of the case also did not collect any evidence in 
support of the allegation that the deceased came to know about the illicit 
relations of the appellant with Mst.Rukhsana Bibi(since acquitted by the 
learned trial court), the co-accused of the appellant and therefore, the 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
30 
 
appellant not only initially exacted violence upon the deceased but 
subsequently also murdered her.  Majid Iqbal, SI (PW-7) , Investigating 
Officer of the case , during cross-examination , admitted as under:- 
“It is correct that the motive that there were illicit relations was between 
accused Mahnaz All and accused Rukhsana Bibi was found false 
during my investigation. It is correct that investigation regarding the 
innocence of accused Zahoor Ahmad Rukhsana Bibi accused was also 
verified by high ups of the police department. 
…………… 
It is correct that during investigation illicit relations of accused and 
Mst.Rukhsana bibi, as alleged by the complainant, were not found. ” 
(emphasis supplied)  
 There is no evidence on record that Memona Bibi daughter of Allah Rakha 
(deceased) was facing any threat to her life at the hands of the appellant 
prior to the occurrence rather, to the contrary, she was living with the 
appellant till her tragic death. This also proves that the appellant and the 
deceased were having a happy and a healthy marital life and hence there 
did not exist any reason for the appellant to have murdered his loving wife. 
The prosecution witnesses failed to provide evidence enabling us to 
determine the truthfulness of the motive alleged and the fact that the said 
motive was so compelling that it could have led the appellant to have 
committed the Qatl-i-Amd of the deceased. There is a poignant hush with 
regard to the particulars of the motive alleged. No independent witness was 
produced by the prosecution to prove the motive as alleged. Even 
otherwise a tainted piece of evidence cannot corroborate another tainted 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
31 
 
piece of evidence. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the 
case of “Muhammad Javed v. The State” (2016 SCMR 2021) as under: 
“The said related and chance witnesses had failed to receive 
any independent corroboration inasmuch as no independent 
proof of the motive set up by the prosecution had been brought 
on the record of the case.” 
 
21. 
      It has been argued by the learned Deputy Prosecutor General that 
where any person dies an unnatural death in the house of such accused, 
then some part of the onus lies on him to establish the circumstances in 
which such unnatural death had occurred. The prosecution is bound to 
prove its case against an accused person beyond a reasonable doubt at all 
stages of a criminal case and in a case where the prosecution asserts the 
presence of some eye-witnesses and such claim of the prosecution is not 
established by it, there the accused person could not be convicted merely 
on the basis of a presumption that since the murder of a person had taken 
place in his house, therefore, it must be he and none else who would have 
committed that murder. The learned Deputy Prosecutor General submits 
that it was in the knowledge of the appellant how the deceased died so it 
was the appellant who was responsible, in the absence of any explanation. 
The law on the burden of proof, as provided in Article 117 of the Qanun-
e-Shahadat, 1984, mandates the prosecution to prove, and that too, beyond 
any doubt, the guilt of the accused for the commission of the crime for 
which he is charged. The said provision provides: 
“117. Burden of proof:- (1) Whoever desires any Court to give 
judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence 
of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist.  
(2) When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is 
said that the burden of proof lies on that person.”

On a conceptual plain, Article 117 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 
enshrines the foundational principle of our criminal justice system, 
whereby the accused is presumed to be innocent unless proved otherwise. 
Accordingly, the burden is placed on the prosecution to prove beyond 
doubt the guilt of the accused, which burden can never be shifted to the 
accused, unless the legislature by express terms commands otherwise. It is 
only when the prosecution is able to discharge the burden of proof by 
establishing the elements of the offence, which are sufficient to bring home 
the guilt of the accused then, the burden is shifted upon the accused, inter 
alia, under Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, to produce 
evidence of facts, which are especially in his exclusive knowledge, and 
practically impossible for the prosecution to prove, to avoid conviction. 
Article 122 of  Qanun-e-Shahadat,1984 reads as under: 
“122. Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge:- When 
any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the 
burden to proving that fact is upon him.” 
It has to be kept in mind that Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 
comes into play only when the prosecution has proved the guilt of the 
accused by producing sufficient evidence, except the facts referred in 
Article 122 Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, leading to the inescapable 
conclusion that the offence was committed by the accused. Then, the 
burden is on the accused not to prove his innocence, but only to produce 
evidence enough to create doubts in the prosecution’s case. It may be noted 
that this issue was also dilated upon by the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan, in the case of “Rehmat alias Rahman alias Waryam alias 
Badshah v. The State” (PLD 1977 SC 515), where, while deliberating 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
33 
 
upon Section 106 of the Evidence Act, which is para materia with Article 
122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, held as under: 
“Needless to emphasis that in spite of section 106 of the Evidence 
Act in criminal case the onus rests on the prosecution to prove the 
guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and this section 
cannot be construed to mean that the onus at any stage shifts on to 
the accused to prove his innocence or make up for the inability and 
failure of the prosecution to produce evidence to establish the guilt 
of the accused. Nor does it relieve! the prosecution of the burden to 
bring the guilt home to the accused. It is only after the prosecution 
has on the evidence adduced by it, succeeded in raising reasonable 
inference of the guilt of the accused, unless the same is rebutted, that 
this section wherever applicable, comes into play and the accused 
may negative the inference by proof of some facts within his special 
knowledge. If, however, the prosecution fails to prove the essential 
ingredients of the offence, no duty is cast on the accused to prove 
his innocence.” 
The ratio decidendi of the above decision was further developed in the case 
of “Nasrullah Alias Nasro Versus The STATE” (2017 S C M R 724), 
wherein, it held as under: 
“It has been argued by the learned counsel for the complainant that 
in the cases of Arshad Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR 1524) 
and Saeed Ahmed v. The State (2015 SCMR 710) this Court had 
held that where a wife of a person or any vulnerable dependent dies 
an unnatural death in the house of such person then some part of 
the onus lies on him to establish the circumstances in which such 
unnatural death had occurred. The learned counsel for the 
complainant has maintained that the stand taken by the appellant 
regarding suicide having been committed by the deceased was 
neither established by him nor did it fit into the circumstances of 
the case, particularly when the medical evidence contradicted the 
same. Be that as it may holding by this Court that some part of the 
onus lies on the accused person in such a case does not mean that 
the entire burden of proof shifts to the accused person in a case of 
this nature. It has already been clarified by this Court in the case 
of Abdul Majeed v. The State (2011 SCMR 941) that the prosecution 
is bound to prove its case against an accused person beyond 
reasonable doubt at all stages of a criminal case and in a case 
where the prosecution asserts presence of some eye-witnesses and 
such claim of the prosecution is not established by it there the 
accused person could not be convicted merely on the basis of a 
presumption that since the murder of his wife had taken place in his 
house, therefore, it must be he and none else who would have 
committed that murder.  
……………………………………………………….. 
In a case of this nature the appellant could not have been convicted 
for the alleged murder merely because he happened to be the 
husband of the deceased.”

In a criminal case, the burden of proof is on the prosecution and article 122 
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 is certainly not intended to relieve it of that 
duty. On the contrary, it is designed to meet certain exceptional cases in 
which it would be impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, 
for the prosecution to establish facts which are “especially” within the 
knowledge of the accused and which he could prove without difficulty or 
inconvenience. If the article was to be interpreted otherwise, it would lead 
to the very startling conclusion that in a murder case the burden lies on the 
accused to prove that he did not commit the murder because who could 
know better than he whether he did or did not. Article 122 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984 cannot be used to undermine the well-established rule of 
law that, save in a very exceptional class of cases, the burden is on the 
prosecution and never shifts. Throughout the web of the Law, one golden 
thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove 
the accused’s guilt subject to any statutory exception. No matter what the 
charge, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the 
accused is the law and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained. As 
discussed above, the prosecution witnesses namely Allah Rakha (PW-1) 
and Muhammad Yaqoob (PW-2) failed miserably to prove their presence 
at the place of occurrence, at the time of occurrence. In a case of this nature, 
the appellant could not have been convicted for the alleged murder merely 
because he happened to be the resident of the place of occurrence. An 
accused person cannot be convicted merely because he did not explain the 
circumstances in which the deceased had lost her life. The august Supreme 
Court of Pakistan has held in the case of “MUHAMMAD JAMSHAID and 
another vs. The State and others” (2016 SCMR 1019 ) as under: 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
35 
 
“only circumstance relied upon by the prosecution was that the 
deadbody of the deceased had been found inside the house of the 
appellant and, hence, it was concluded by the courts below that it 
must be none other than the present appellant who had done the 
deceased to death. We have found such an approach adopted by the 
courts below to be nothing but speculative”. 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of “Arshad 
Khan  vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 564 ) as under: 
“It may be true that it has been held by this Court in the cases of 
Arshad Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR 1524) and Saeed 
Ahmed v. The State (2015 SCMR 710) that in such cases some part 
of the onus lies on the accused person to explain as to how and in 
which circumstances the accused person’s wife had died an 
unnatural death inside the confines of the matrimonial home but at 
the same time it has also been clarified by this Court in the case of 
Abdul Majeed v. The State (2011 SCMR 941) that where the 
prosecution completely fails to discharge its initial onus there no 
part of the onus shifts to the accused person at all.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of “Nazeer 
Ahmed vs. The State” (2016 SCMR 1628 ) as under: 
“It may be true that when a vulnerable dependant is done to death 
inside the confines of a house, particularly during a night, there 
some part of the onus lies on the close relatives of the deceased to 
explain as to how their near one had met an unnatural death but 
where the prosecution utterly fails to prove its own case against an 
accused person there the accused person cannot be convicted on 
the sole basis of his failure to explain the death. These aspects of 
the legal issue have been commented upon by this Court in the cases 
of Arshad Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR 1524), Abdul Majeed 
v. The State (2011 SCMR 941) and Saeed Ahmed v. The State (2015 
SCMR 710).” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of “Asad Khan 
vs. The State” (PLD 2017 Supreme Court 681 ) as under: 
“It had been held by this Court in the case of Arshad Mehmood v. 
The State (2005 SCMR 1524) that where a wife of a person dies an 
unnatural death in the house of such person there some part of the 
onus lies on him to establish the circumstances in which such 
unnatural death had occurred. In the later case of Saeed Ahmed v. 
The State (2015 SCMR 710) the said legal position had been 
elaborated and it had been held that an accused person is under 
some kind of an obligation to explain the circumstances in which 
his vulnerable dependent had met an unnatural death within the 
confines of his house; It had, however, been held in the case of 
Abdul Majeed v. The State (2011 SCMR 941) that where the entire 
case of the prosecution stands demolished or is found to be utterly 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
36 
 
unbelievable there an accused person cannot be convicted merely 
because he did not explain the circumstances in which his wife or 
some vulnerable dependent had lost his life. In such a case the 
entire burden of proof cannot be shifted to him in that regard if the 
case of the prosecution itself collapses. The present case is a case 
of the latter category wherein the entire case of the prosecution has 
been found by us to be utterly unbelievable and the same stands 
demolished and, thus, we cannot sustain the appellant’s conviction 
and sentence merely on the basis of an inference or a supposition 
qua his involvement.” 
The august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held in the case of “Abdul 
Majeed vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 941 ) as under: 
“The basic principle of criminal law is that it is the burden of the 
prosecution to prove its case against the accused beyond 
reasonable doubt. This burden remains throughout and does not 
shift to the accused, who is only burdened to prove a defence plea, 
if he takes one. The strangulation to death of the appellant’s wife 
in his house may be a circumstance to be taken into account along 
with the other prosecution evidence. However; this by itself would 
not be sufficient to establish the appellant’s guilt in the absence of 
any other evidence of the prosecution connecting him to the crime. 
The prosecution has also not been able to establish that the 
appellant was present in the house at the time his wife was 
murdered. This, perhaps, distinguishes this case from that of “Afzal 
Hussain Shah v. The State” (ibid) where the accused admittedly 
was present in the house when his wife was killed.” 
 
22. 
Considering all the above circumstances, we entertain serious doubt 
in our minds regarding the involvement of the appellant namely Mahnaz 
Ali son of Nazir Ahmad, in the present case. It is a settled principle of law 
that for giving the benefit of the doubt, it is not necessary that there should 
be so many circumstances rather if only a single circumstance creating 
reasonable doubt in the mind of a prudent person is available then such 
benefit is to be extended to an accused not as a matter of concession but as 
of right. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad 
Mansha Vs. The State” (2018 SCMR 772) has enunciated the following 
principle: 
“Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt to an 
accused it is not necessary that there should be many 
circumstances creating doubt. If there is a circumstance which 

Murder Reference No. 06 of 2022 
Criminal Appeal   No. 68 of 2022 
 
 
37 
 
creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of 
the accused, then the accused would be entitled to the benefit of 
such doubt, not as a matter of grace and concession, but as a 
matter of right. It is based on the maxim, “it is better that ten 
guilty persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be 
convicted”. Reliance in this behalf can be made upon the cases 
of Tariq Pervez v. The State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir 
and 2 others v. The State (2008 SCMR 1221), Muhammad 
Akramv.The State (2009 SCMR 230) and Muhammad 
Zamanv.The State (2014 SCMR 749).” 
 
Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the august Supreme Court of 
Pakistan “Najaf Ali Shah Vs. the State” (2021 S C M R 736) in which it 
has been as infra: 
“9. 
Mere heinousness of the offence if not proved to the hilt 
is not a ground to avail the majesty of the court to do complete 
justice. This is an established principle of law and equity that 
it is better that 100 guilty persons should let off but one 
innocent person should not suffer. As the preeminent English 
jurist William Blackstone wrote, “Better that ten guilty 
persons escape, than that one innocent suffer.” Benjamin 
Franklin, who was one of the leading figures of early 
American history, went further arguing “it is better a hundred 
guilty persons should escape than one innocent person should 
suffer.” All the contradictions noted by the learned High 
Court are sufficient to cast a shadow of doubt on the 
prosecution’s case, which entitles the petitioner to the right 
of benefit of the doubt. It is a well settled principle of law that 
for the accused to be afforded this right of the benefit of the 
doubt it is not necessary that there should be many 
circumstances creating uncertainty and if there is only one 
doubt, the benefit of the same must got to the petitioner. This 
Court in the case of Mst. Asia Bibi v. The State (PLD 2019 SC 
64) while relying on the the earlier judgments of this Court 
has categorically held that “if a single circumstance creates 
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the apprehension 
of guilt of an accused, then he/she shall be entitled to such 
benefit not as a matter of grace and concession, but as of 
right. Reference in this regard may be made to the cases of 
Tariq Pervaiz v. The State (1998 SCMR 1345) and Ayub 
Masih v. The State (PLD 2002 SC 1048).” The same view was 
reiterated in Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR 129) when 
this court observed that once a single loophole is observed in 
a case presented by the prosecution, such as conflict in the 
ocular account and medical evidence or presence of eye-
witnesses being doubtful, the benefit of such loophole/lacuna 
in the prosecution’s case automatically goes in favour of an 
accused.”
