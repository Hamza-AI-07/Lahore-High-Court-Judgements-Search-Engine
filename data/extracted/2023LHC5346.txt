Mr. Omar Arshad Hakeem, Advocate for the Applicant. 
Ms. Kausar Parveen, Advocate for Customs Department.  
This and connected Customs Reference Application 
No.57846/2023 are directed against common judgment 
dated 26.07.2023, of Customs Appellate Tribunal Bench 
Lahore. Following question of law is proposed for 
determination, 
Whether the learned bench failed to appreciate 
that no penal consequences could be invoked 
against the applicant or its agent in absence of 
constitution of offence of misdeclaration under 
Section 32 of the Customs Act, 1969? 
 
2. 
Learned 
counsel 
for 
Applicant 
Company 
(Applicant) submits that mere declaration qua particulars 
of imported goods for in-bonding of goods does not 
constitute offence in terms of section 32 of the Customs 
Act 1969. Adds that question of determination of duties 
would arise at the time of clearance of goods – at the time 
of ex-bonding. Learned counsel referred to section 30(b), 

Customs Reference No.57848/2023 
 
-:2:- 
 
read with section 104 of the Customs Act 1969 to elucidate 
time of determination of duties. 
3. 
Conversely, 
learned 
counsel 
for 
respondent 
department submits that incorrect particulars, regarding 
identity of the goods in terms of PCT Heading, were 
disclosed to prejudice determination / assessment of duties. 
Adds that declaration made in terms of section 79 of 
Customs Act 1969, wherein misdeclaration was made, 
attracts mischief of section 32 of Customs Act, 1969. Adds 
that only penalty was imposed in lieu of misclassification 
of PCT Heading and no claim regarding assessment of 
duties and payment thereof was raised. 
4. 
Arguments 
heard. 
Applicant, 
acting 
through 
Clearing Agent, entered declaration for warehousing of 
imported goods in terms of section 79 of the Customs Act 
1969. Declaration contained particulars / description of 
imported goods - [for In-bonding], which were found 
incorrect upon comparing with Lab-Report. Upon 
discovering incorrect declaration, show cause notice was 
issued, alleging violation of various sections including 
clause 14 of section 156 (1) of Customs Act 1969. Order in 
original was passed, wherein liability qua evaded duties 
was imposed with addition of personal liability. Appellate 

Customs Reference No.57848/2023 
 
-:3:- 
 
Tribunal rejected claim of evaded duties on the premise 
that duties need to be re-assessed at the time of clearance 
of goods in terms of section 30(b), 104 and 109 of the 
Customs Act 1969, but retained penalty, though reduced 
quantum thereof from Rs.1,000,000/- to Rs.500,000/-. 
Primary argument is that since duties had to be assessed at 
the time of clearance of goods, and not for in-bonding, 
therefore, section 32 has no application is attracted.  
5. 
Argument is misconceived. It is not controverted 
that declaration for warehousing, qua the imported goods, 
was submitted in terms of section 79 of the Customs Act 
1969, wherein particulars / description of goods was 
provided and same was found incorrect – in the context of 
description of goods and wrong mentioning of PCT 
Heading. Is the declaration submitted/statement made, 
when found wrong, constitute an offence under section 32 
of Customs Act 1969. It is expedient to reproduce section 
32(1) and clause 14 of section 156(1) of the Customs Act 
1969, which read as, 
Section 32 of Customs Act 1969 
“32. Untrue statement, error, etc.- (1) If any person, 
in connection with any matter of customs,- 
(a) makes or signs or causes to be made or signed, 
or delivers or causes to be delivered to an officer 
of customs any declaration, notice, certificate or 
other document whatsoever, or  

Customs Reference No.57848/2023 
 
-:4:- 
 
(b) makes any statement in answer to any question 
put to him by an officer of customs which he is 
required by or under this Act to answer, [or]  
[(c) submits any false statement or document 
electronically 
through 
automated 
clearance 
system regarding any matter of Customs,] 
 [knowing or having reason to believe that such 
document or statement is false] in any material 
particular, he shall be guilty of an offence under this 
section”.  
(2) ……….. 
(3) ………… 
 
 
Clause (14) of section 156(1) of Customs Act 1969 
[14. If any person commits 
an offence under  
(i) Sub-section (1) or sub-
section (2) of section 
32; 
such person shall be liable 
to a penalty not exceeding 
one 
hundred 
thousand 
rupees or three times the 
value of the goods in 
respect of which such 
offence 
is 
committed, 
whichever be greater; and 
such goods shall also be 
liable to confiscation; and 
upon 
conviction 
by 
a 
Special Judge  he shall 
further 
be 
liable 
to 
imprisonment for a term 
not exceeding three years, 
or to fine, or to both; 
5. 
A bare perusal of sub-section (1) of section 32 of 
Customs Act 1969 indicates its independent existence for 
the purposes of attracting penalty in terms of clause 14 of 
section 156(1) of Customs Act 1969. Clause 14, ibid, treats 
offence under sub-section (1) of section 32 of Customs Act 
as an independent offence, for the purposes of the penalty 

Customs Reference No.57848/2023

envisaged. A person can be charged with offence under 
sub-section (1) of section 32 of Customs Act 1969 where 
same had knowingly and reason to believe that document 
furnished, and statement made in connection with the 
matter of Customs, is false. Guidance is solicited from the 
construction proposed to section 32 of the Customs Act 
1969 by Apex Court in the case of M/s Baba Khan vs. 
Collector of Customs, Quetta and 2 others (PTCL 2000 
CL 688), relevant portion of the decision is reproduced for 
ease of reference, 
 
“4. 
We have carefully perused the provisions of 
section 32 and also section 79 of the Customs Act, 
1969. Under subsection (1) of section 32, if any 
person in connection with any matter of customs 
makes any declaration or statement which is untrue 
in any material particulars, he is guilty of an offence 
under that section. No reference is made in section 
32(1) to section 79 or that such declaration or mis-
statement is made in the bill-of-entry. For an untrue 
declaration or statement to come within the mischief 
of section 32(1), the same should be untrue in any 
material particulars and that the statement or 
declaration is made "connection" with any matter of 
customs. The words "any matter of customs" are not 
restricted to bills-of-entry.” 
6. 
There is another aspect. Sub-section (1) of section 
32 of Customs Act 1969 does not draw any distinction 
between declaration made either for the purposes of in-
bonding or ex-bonding. Evidently, incorrect declaration / 
statements made, even for the purposes of in-bonding, is 
covered under the expression in connection with any 

Customs Reference No.57848/2023

matter of customs, and same constitutes an offence under 
sub-section (1) of section 32 of the Customs Act 1969, 
incurring penalty in terms of clause 14 of section 156(1) of 
Customs Act 1969. Factum of knowledge is not disputed – 
Clearing agent, who acted for the applicant, has not 
preferred any application before this Court. Finding of fact 
was recorded by the Tribunal with respect to the intent 
underlying mis-declaration.  
  
In wake of the narrative above, case at hand falls 
within the ambit of sub-section (1) of section 32 of the 
Customs Act 1969, which attracts penalty, notwithstanding 
submission of declaration for ex-bonding for the purposes 
of ascertaining duties at later stage.  
7. 
In view of the above, the question of law proposed is 
answered in negative. Reference application is decided 
against the Applicant and in favour of the department. 
8. 
Office shall send a copy of this order, under seal of 
the Court, to learned Appellate Tribunal, in terms of sub-
section (5) of section 196 of Customs Act, 1969.
