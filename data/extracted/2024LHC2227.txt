         Sultan Tanvir Ahmad, J:– Through this 
regular second appeal, order dated 18.01.2012 passed 
by the learned First Appellate Court is challenged, 
whereby, judgment and decree dated 18.11.2008 passed 
by the learned trial Court has been set-aside and suit filed 
by Abdul Sattar Khan has been dismissed.  
2.  
Brief facts of the case are that on 19.09.1998 
Abdul Sattar Khan filed suit for specific performance    
of agreement to sell dated 21.03.1995. This suit           

 
R.S.A No. 08-2012

was contested and the learned civil Court Rahim Yar 
Khan framed the relevant issues, out of divergence in the 
pleadings. The parties led their evidence.  On 18.11.2008 
the learned trial Court decreed the suit in favour of Abdul 
Sattar Khan and against Muhammad Ibrahim and others.  
3. 
Muhammad Ibrahim preferred appeal No. 153 
of 2011 on 04.12.2008. In course of proceedings, before 
the learned First Appellate Court, Abdul Sattar Khan 
made offer that if Muhammad Ibrahim would state on 
special oath to the effect that he has neither executed any 
agreement to sell nor issued the receipt or obtained any 
amount, he has no objection in accepting the appeal. The 
offer was accepted on the same day i.e. 18.01.2012. As 
per the order-sheet, on oath statement of Muhammad 
Ibrahim was recorded. Consequently, through order dated 
18.01.2012, the judgment and decree of the learned trial 
Court was set-aside and the appeal was accepted. Decree 
sheet was drawn accordingly. Order and decree dated 
18.01.2012 has been challenged through the present 
second appeal. 
4.  
Mr. Aejaz Ahmed Ansari (learned Senior-ASC) 
on behalf of the appellant has stated that special oath was 
never administered by the learned First Appellate Court. 
Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that 
upon the acceptance of offer, administering oath by 
laying hands on the Holy Quran after arranging Holy 
Quran in the Court and to give statement in the presence 
of the parties and their learned counsel, was inevitable; 
that the learned First Appellate Court has failed to follow 
the required procedure, which is fatal for the case. 
Learned counsel for the appellant is seeking an order of 
remand so that the first appeal can be adjudicated and 

 
R.S.A No. 08-2012 
 
 
3 
decided on its merits. 
5.   
On the other hand, Mr. Nazir Ahmad Lar, 
learned counsel for the respondents, has opposed the 
above arguments by stating that the oath was 
administered in terms of the Oath Act, 1873 (the ‘Oath 
Act’), after offer was accepted in unambiguous terms; 
that the challenge through the present appeal is an 
attempt to resile from the terms of binding contract that 
has taken place before a Court. Learned counsel for the 
respondents has further stated that the principle of 
approbate and reprobate is attracted to this case and in 
this regard, he relied upon case titled “Muhammad 
Rafique versus Nasir Mehmood” (PLD 2016 Lahore 
428). Learned counsel for the respondents has also 
argued his case on basis of principle of estoppel as well 
as sanctity attached to the oath while relying upon cases 
titled  “Rafi Kashif versus Imtiaz Ahmad and 2 others” 
(2001 MLD 128), “Pitras Gill versus Parvaiz Bhatti” 
(2016 CLC 1618). “Chief Commissioner Inland Revenue 
Regional Tax Office, Multan versus Muhammad Bilal 
and 7 others” [PLJ 2012 Lahore 149 (DB)] and 
“Muhammad Mansha and 7 others versus Abdul Sattar 
and 4 others” (1995 SCMR 795). 
6.  
I have heard the arguments and also gone 
through the record with the help of the learned counsel 
for the parties. 
7.  
The law is already settled in case titled “Sajid 
Mehmood versus Mst. Shazia Azad and others” (2023 
SCMR 153) that an offer or proposal to be bound by on 
oath statement of the opposite party after its acceptance 
and administering special oath is binding upon the parties, 
who then cannot wriggle out from the same and in the 

 
R.S.A No. 08-2012 
 
 
4 
absence of satisfactory or sufficient cause the Courts are 
obliged to implement the agreement and rest the decision 
of the case on the basis of the binding contract. 
8.  
The Oath Act has not provided any procedure 
for recording the statement on special oath but the Court 
can adopt its own procedure ensuring that no prejudice is 
caused to any of the parties to the lis. In this regard, 
ample guidelines have already been given by the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in cases titled “Ahmad Khan 
and others versus Jewan” (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 
655) and “Muhammad Ali versus Major Muhammad 
Aslam and others” (PLD 1990 Supreme Court 841). 
The Courts are obligated to secure the interest of the 
parties and prevent from hasty decisions taken by the 
parties, during examination of witnesses or during a 
heated discussion or arguments. It is observed by the 
Supreme Court that during heated or intense discussions 
sometimes such offers are made or accepted, which 
otherwise in the state of cool deliberation one would not 
arrive at. The Courts of the Country are guided to be 
cautious in observing that such statements are not 
recorded with the snap-speed.  
 9.  
Though the statements in the present case are 
recorded on the same day, however, learned counsel for the 
appellant  has not argued that the offer was made by Abdul 
Sattar Khan in haste or due to any heated discussions. I  
have also carefully examined the grounds taken in this 
second appeal. No ground is taken in the appeal raising 
any grievance as to recording the offer, acceptance and 
then passing final order in one day. Thus, offer and its 
acceptance are not disputed and the only controversy is 
regarding the administration of the special oath.

 10.  
Now I would like to reproduce the statements 
and proceedings recorded in order-sheet, prior to the final 
order, which are as under: - 
        “During the course of arguments, the 
respondent wants to make his statement. As per 
request, let his statement be recorded.

          Addl:District Judge, 
                18.01.2012.  
 
   Rahim Yar Khan” 
11.  
The above reflects that in unambiguous and 
clear terms Abdul Sattar Khan has made his offer that if 
oath on Holy Quran is given by Muhammad Ibrahim to 
the effect that he has not executed the agreement to sell 
and issued the receipt or obtained any amount from 
Abdul Sattar Khan, then he has no objection if the suit is 
dismissed by accepting the appeal. At the margin of this 
order-sheet thumb impression of Abdul Sattar Khan is 
reflected. His learned advocate also signed at the margin 
of the order-sheet. They being fully aware of the 
consequences have made this offer, which is not disputed 
even today before this Court. The learned Judge after 
recording this statement proceeded to record the 
statement of Muhammad Ibrahim which is also 
reproduced above. First part of the statement of 
Muhammad Ibrahim says that he accepted the offer made 
by respondent. This acceptance is followed by word 
“and”. The statement after the word ‘and’ reveals that 
Muhammad Ibrahim gave oath on Holy Quran that he 
neither executed any agreement or receipt nor obtained 
amount from Abdul Sattar Khan. It seems that first offer 
was accepted and then statement of Muhammad Ibrahim, 
after administration of oath, was recorded.  
12.  
The above is followed by a detailed order of the 
learned First Appellate Court, which reads as under: -    
 
         “Presence as before. 
         In view of the offer made by the 

 
R.S.A No. 08-2012 
 
 
7 
respondent/plaintiff as well as statement made 
by the appellant/defendant in presence of 
their counsel, the proceedings on Oath 
initiated 
after 
recording 
statement 
of 
respondent Abdul Sattar, the appellant 
accepted the offer and recorded his statement. 
The law facilitates to decide the case on Oath, 
since counsel for the parties and the parties 
themselves are satisfied to decide the matter 
on the basis of Oath. In view of statements 
recorded by the Court, the appeal in hand 
stands accepted and the impugned judgment 
and decree dated 18.11.2008 stand set-aside. 
Resultantly, 
the 
suit 
filed 
by 
the 
respondent/plaintiff 
is 
deemed 
to 
be 
dismissed, with no order as to costs. Record 
of the learned trial Court alongwith copy of 
this order be sent back and record of this 
Court be consigned to the record room after 
due completion.” 
 
 
This order also discloses that the proceedings 
on oath were initiated and the statement was recorded 
after Muhammad Ibrahim took oath on Holy Quran. The 
subsequent part of the above order confirms that the 
learned Judge of the First Appellate Court was mindful of 
the fact that law facilitates to decide cases on oath. It is 
also observed by the learned First Appellate Court that 
the parties and their lawyers remained satisfied to decide 
the matter on oath. Only thereafter the learned Judge 
proceeded to allow the appeal and dismiss the suit.   
 13.  
Mr. Aejaz Ahmed Ansari (learned Senior-ASC) 
has relied upon an affidavit of Abdul Sattar Khan that he 
filed in consequence of order dated 10.02.2012 passed by 
this Court. It is stated in the affidavit of Abdul Sattar 
Khan that after mutual consent (offer and acceptance), 
proceedings for administering special oath have not taken 
place. The relevant clause (No. 4) of this affidavit reads 
as follows: - 

 
R.S.A No. 08-2012 
 
 
8 
 "ہی ہک دعاتل الیپ ےن دعب ازاں راضدنمی ےک ایبن ےک دعب اباقدعہ
فلح یک اک راا ی ہ یک ہ ی ہی ایبن اھک ہک ںی آرنن دیج ر فلح ے  ر
 اتہک وہں ہک ںی ےن ارایض دتموعہی اک وسےا رمہاہ دمیع راپسڈنٹن ہ ایک اھت
 اار زرنمث اوصل ہ ایک اھت ہکبج ایبن انھکل رضاری اھت اار الزیم رشاطئ
اعمدہہ یھت۔"
 
14.  
As a matter of fact, the entire case is built up on 
the basis of above affidavit negating that the proceedings 
of administering oath have not taken place before the 
learned First Appellate Court. However, the order-sheet 
recording the statement and the detailed order passed on 
18.01.2012 reflect otherwise. In case titled “Abdullah 
versus Shaukat” (2001 SCMR 60), the Supreme Court 
ruled that the genuineness of judicial record cannot be 
sacrificed at the altar of expediency of a litigant. In the 
said case an affidavit of learned counsel for the appellant 
to contradict order passed in first regular appeal, was 
given no effect. In “Fayyaz Hussain versus Akbar 
Hussain and others” (2004 SCMR 964) the Supreme 
Court refused to accept an affidavit of a learned 
Advocate to persuade against the sanctity of judicial 
order. It has been observed: -  
“…There is always a presumption of 
correctness in favour 
of 
judicial 
proceedings and credibility is attached 
to the proceedings before a judicial 
forum. Strong and unimpeachable 
evidence is required to rebut the 
presumption which is badly lacking in 
the case in hand. We are fortified in our 
view, by the dictum laid down by this 
Court in Ghulam Muhammad v. Malik 

 
R.S.A No. 08-2012 
 
 
9 
Abdul Qadir Khan PLD 1983 SC 68 
which is on all fours and attracted in 
the facts and circumstances of this 
case…” 
15. 
In case titled “Nasrullah Jan versus Rastabaz 
Khan” (NLR 1996 SCJ 163), where a party attempted to 
resile from his offer after on oath statement of the rival 
party was taken, the Supreme Court held that once the 
oath is completed on the basis of offer and acceptance 
culminating into a decree, such decree cannot be lightly 
interfered with and set-aside on flimsy or technical 
ground in view of the sanctity attached to a statement on 
oath. In case titled “Najibullah Khan and another versus 
Fazal Karim and 2 others” (1997 SCMR 1085) the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan, while dealing with a case 
where the decision was made on the basis of special oath, 
observed that presumption of correctness is attached to 
the order of the learned District Judge. It will be 
beneficial to reproduce the following extract of 
Najibullah Khan case (supra): - 
  
“3. 
We 
have 
considered 
the 
submissions made by the learned 
counsel for the petitioners. We do not 
agree with him. We find that in the 
order dated 6-10-1994, it is clearly 
stated that the petitioner No.1 in 
presence of his counsel offered oath to 
the plaintiffs which was accepted by the 
latter. It has also been stated in the 
same 
order 
that 
Najeebullah 
defendant/petitioner agreed and made 
offer that in case the plaintiffs/ 
respondents take oath on the Holy 
Qur'an, their suit may be decreed. The 
presumption of correctness is attached 
to the order of the District Judge. 
Neither the petitioners/defendants, nor 
their counsel filed any Affidavit to the 

 
R.S.A No. 08-2012 
 
 
10 
effect 
that 
Najeebullah 
or 
the 
petitioners had not agreed and made 
offer 
that 
in 
case 
the 
plaintiffs/respondents take oath on the 
Holy Qur'an then their suit may be 
decreed. 
When 
the 
plaintiffs/respondents took oath on the 
Holy Qur'an in the open Court, the 
petitioners did not object to it. Now, 
when the plaintiffs/respondents have 
taken oath on the Holy Qur'an and the 
District Judge has decided the suit 
accordingly, it does not lay with the 
petitioners to resile from agreement 
and their offer and to say that the 
decision was made against their 
consent. The objection that the oath 
proceedings were not covered by 
Article 163 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 
1984 was raised before the High Court 
and was rightly disposed of. Since the 
District Judge has decided the appeal 
in accordance with the Oath taken by 
the plaintiffs on Holy Qur’an and that 
too 
with 
the 
agreement 
of 
the 
petitioners, 
we 
do 
not 
see 
any 
justification to interfere with the 
impugned judgment.” 
  
 
(Emphasis Supplied) 
16.  
As already observed that reading of the order-
sheet as well as final order dated 18.01.2012 of the 
learned First Appellate Court does not suggest that 
special oath was not administered. Strong presumption of 
correctness is attached to said order. The affidavit of a 
litigant (Abdul Sattar Khan) is not sufficient to rebut 
presumption of correctness. This too in view of the fact 
that Muhammad Ibrahim, who is now represented 
through his legal heirs, during his lifetime and the 
pendency of this second appeal filed his affidavit on 
27.03.2012 categorically confirming that the learned First 
Appellate Court administered special oath, in the 

 
R.S.A No. 08-2012 
 
 
11 
following terms: - 
"3
 ر یک اجبن ےس شیپ شک

"ےس اوصل یک ےہ۔   
 
The reliance by Mr. Ansari on the affidavit of 
Abdul Sattar Khan, in view of the counter affidavit of 
Muhammad Ibrahim that he gave in his life time and the 
strong presumption of correctness to the order-sheet / 
judicial proceedings of the Court, has no value. 
17.  
The Oath Act does not prescribe any formality 
of procedure for a special oath. What required is an offer 
(section 8 of the Oath Act), its communication to the 
other party or witness by the Court in terms of section 9 
of the Oath Act and acceptance, followed by 
administration of oath and then statement, as envisaged 
in section 10 of the Oath Act. Section 11 of the Oath Act 
provides that the evidence so given shall, as against the 
person who offered to be bound as aforesaid, be 
conclusive proof of the matter stated. In case titled 
“Ratanlal Saligram and another versus Nathulal 
Pankarji Namdeo” [AIR 1961 Madhya Pradesh 108 (V 
48 C 43)] it has been observed that where the above 
discussed requirements have been fulfilled and recorded 
in the order-sheet, it becomes inconsequential that the 
statements are not separately recorded. It will be 
beneficial to reproduce the following extract of Ratanlal 
Saligram case (supra):- 
      “(4) Adverting to the merits of the 
case, it is true that the plaintiff's 
proposal 
and 
the 
defendants' 
acceptance to administer special oath 

 
R.S.A No. 08-2012 
 
 
12 
were 
not 
made 
by 
means 
of 
applications, and it is also true that on 
a 
separate 
deposition 
form 
the 
statement of the defendant was not 
recorded. I am called up- on to decide 
the effect of this. In the Oaths Act 1873, 
no such formalities of procedure have 
been prescribed. All that is required is 
that there must be an offer to be bound 
by a special oath as mentioned in 
section 8, and the acceptance of the 
offer by the other party; thereupon the 
court may proceed to administer such 
oath. The evidence given by the party 
taking oath then becomes conclusive 
proof of the matter stated. 
     Where all this is recorded in the 
order sheet of the Court, it is 
inconsequential that the proposal, the 
acceptance and the statement were not 
separately recorded. In the absence of 
any special procedure, the judgment 
and decree of the trial Judge could not 
be set aside for want of those 
formalities. The Court has to see in 
substance whether the requirements of 
the Oaths Act were fulfilled. In this 
case, 
below 
the 
order-sheet 
of 
December, 5, 1957, the plaintiff has put 
his signature. Neither on that day nor 
on any other day, did he approach the 
trial Judge with any grievance.” 
18.  
In the wake of above discussion, I am of the 
opinion that no mistake is made by the learned First 
Appellate Court. Therefore, present appeal is dismissed. 
No order as to costs.
