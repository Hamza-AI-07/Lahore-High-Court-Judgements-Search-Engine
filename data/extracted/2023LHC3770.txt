Shahid Karim, J:-. This petition and a cluster of connected 
petitions (Appendix-I) raise questions of law which can be 

W.P No.16217 of 2020 
2 
 
 
decided together.  Primarily, the challenge is to the 
constitution of the Authority under the Punjab Revenue 
Authority Act, 2012 (“the Authority”).  Further challenges 
have been laid to the issuance of show cause notices by the 
officers of the Authority under Section 52 of the Punjab Sales 
Tax on Services Act, 2012 (“Act, 2012”).  In view of the 
issues involved in these petitions the following order was 
passed on 08.03.2022:  
  “Arguments have been partly heard.  It is evident that the primary 
challenge in these petitions is to the constitution of the Authority under 
the Punjab Revenue Authority Act, 2012 in particular sub-section  (4) 
of section 3 which mandates that the Authority should consist of 
Chairperson and other members and further provides that the manner 
and terms & conditions of appointment of the Chairperson and 
members shall be as prescribed and until so prescribed may be 
determined by the government.  The learned counsel for Authority has 
produced a notification before this Court today which seeks to entrust 
permanent charge of post of Chairperson, PRA to Mr. Zain ul Abidin 
Sahi.  Despite two judgments having been passed by different Benches 
of this Court requiring the statutory rules to be followed by the Govt. of 
the Punjab, it is not being done.  The reluctance of the government to 
do so works to the detriment of the functionality of PRA.  This is not a 
conducive and beneficial state of affairs and government must be 
compelled to comply with the provisions of section 3(4) of the Act, 2012 
so that composition of the Authority is made in accordance with the 
law.  For the purpose, learned A.A.G shall place this order of the Court 
before the concerned Secretary who shall initiate steps for prescribing 
rules in this regard.  These rules shall be placed before this Court on 
the next date of hearing.  Until this is done, the further questions raised 
in these petitions shall be postponed to be decided subsequent to the 
first steps which are required to be followed by the Govt. of the 
Punjab.” 
2. 
On subsequent dates of hearing time was given to the 
Province of Punjab to enact the rules regarding constitution of 
the Authority.  At later stage while the arguments of the 
counsel for the parties were continuing, it became expedient 
to defer the determination of question as to constitution of the 
Authority owing to the fact that the question was already 
pending determination before a Division Bench of this Court 
and, therefore, on 30.05.2023 an order was passed to the 
following effect: 
“This order will apply to all petitions in this bundle. 
Learned counsel for the respondent-PRA has produced a 
notification dated 01.04.2022 by which the constitution of 

W.P No.16217 of 2020 
3 
 
 
the authority has been made. Learned counsel for the 
petitioners submit that the question is regarding the gap 
between the holding of the learned Single Judge and 
reported as “Nishat Hotles and Properties Limited, etc., v. 
The Province of Punjab, etc.” (PLD 2019 Lahore 729) and 
the promulgation of this notification constituting the 
authority and so the question would still be whether the 
authority was validly constituted and performing its 
functions, as admittedly during this period there was no 
authority in place. This question is linked with the broader 
question regarding the determination made by the learned 
Single Judge on the issue of sub-section (4) of section 5 of 
the Punjab Revenue Authority Act, 2012 and that question 
is before a Division Bench of this Court and any 
determination by this Court in these petitions would be 
duplication and an encroachment of the jurisdiction of the 
Division Bench to determine the issue before it. Therefore, 
the learned counsel for the petitioners agree that this 
question should be determined by the Division Bench. 
2. 
 
Learned counsel for the petitioners however 
submits that there are related issues which challenged the 
jurisdiction of the officers, who have issued individual 
notices to the petitioners as also other issues, which can be 
taken up by this Court. One of the issues in some of these 
petitions is relating to the applicability of the law and the 
imposition of the levy on petitioners. That issue is also a 
separate issue and may be dealt with independent of the 
broader question relating to vires, which was agitated in 
these petitions. On the rest of the issues, the petitioners are 
permitted to address arguments so that the issues are 
narrowed down and must focus on individual issues 
brought by the petitioners. For the purpose, the petitions 
are listed for hearing on 05.06.2023. 
3. 
As is evident from paragraph 2 of the order set out 
above that these petitions are to be decided on narrower 
grounds relating to jurisdiction of the officers who have 
issued the show cause notices to the petitioners.  Thus, these 
petitions can be disposed of on the short question whether the 
enforcement officers who have issued the show cause notices 
to the petitioners were competent to do so under the law.  For 
the purpose, section 39 of the Act, 2012 would be engaged 
which provides that: 
“39. 
Appointment of authorities.– (1) For purposes of 
this Act and the rules, the Authority may, in the prescribed 
manner and by notification in the official Gazette, appoint 
in relation to any area or cases specified in the notification, 
any person to be a– 
 
(a) 
Commissioner;

 [(fff) Enforcement Officer ;] 
 
(g)

(h) 
An officer of the Authority with any other 
designation. 
(2) 
The 
Commissioner 
(Appeals) 
and 
the 
Commissioner shall be subordinate to the Authority. 
(3) 
The 
Additional 
Commissioners, 
Deputy 
Commissioners and the Assistant Commissioners shall 
be subordinate to the Commissioner and unless 
otherwise 
directed 
by 
the 
Authority 
or 
the 
Commissioner, both the Deputy Commissioner and the 
Assistant Commissioner shall also be subordinate to 
the Additional Commissioner. 
(4) Risk Compliance Officers, Enforcement Officers, 
Audit Officers, Inspectors and other officers of equal 
or lower designations, if any, shall be subordinate to 
the Deputy Commissioner or, as the case may be, to 
the Assistant Commissioner or as the Authority may, 
from time to time, specify. 
(5) 
The Authority may designate any Deputy 
Commissioner supervisory incharge of any Assistant 
Commissioner either by name or by designation in any 
of its subordinate offices or formations. 
(6) 
The Authority may distribute the work and 
related functions amongst the above designations in a 
manner it deems appropriate and make changes in 
such work distribution as and when deemed proper. 
(7) 
The Authority may, by notification in the official 
Gazette, prescribe uniform including shoulder strips 
and badges for different classes of the officers or 
officials of the Authority. 
(8) 
All jurisdictional and competency issues arising 
under this Act or the rules shall be decided by the 
Authority in such manner as it thinks fit.

4. 
For the purpose of resolution of this dispute, the words 
“in the prescribed manner” used in Sub-section (1) of Section 
39 would assume critical importance.  It is the contention of 
the counsel for the petitioners that the term ‘prescribed 
manner’ is a term of art and has been defined in section 2(31) 
of the Act, 2012 to mean: 
“2(31) “prescribed” means prescribed by the rules.” 
5. 
The term ‘prescribed” means prescribed by the rules.  
The power to make rules has been conferred by section 76 of 
the Act, 2012 and the power vests in the Authority which may 
enact rules with the approval of the government and by 
notification in the official gazette.  Sub-section (2) of section 
76 further provides that all rules made under Sub-section (1) 
during a financial year shall be laid in Provincial Assembly of 
the Punjab at the time of presentation of the Annual Budget 
for the next financial year.  Thus, appointment of the officers 
and authorities for the purposes of the Act, 2012 has to be 
done by the Authority by firstly enacting rules as this is the 
only prescribed manner in which the appointment can be 
made.  The power vesting in the Authority under Section 39 
relates to appointment of officers in relation to any area or 
cases specified in the notification.  It indubitably follows that 
unless there are rules which have been enacted for the 
specific purpose of appointment of officers mentioned in 
section 39 to exercise jurisdiction in relation to certain areas 
or cases, those officers cannot assume the jurisdiction to 
exercise powers in terms of section 52 of the Act, 2012and to 
issue show cause notice. 

W.P No.16217 of 2020

6. 
Learned counsel for PRA admits to the position 
regarding absence of the rules in this regard.  He, however, 
invited this Court to hold that the words “in the prescribed 
manner” is a drafting error on the part of Provincial Assembly 
and must be ignored.  This is a fantastic argument to say the 
least and cuts across the fundamental rule of interpretation to 
the effect that redundancy cannot be attributed to the 
legislature.  In my opinion, if the legislature intended the 
Authority to appoint officers by firstly enacting rules in this 
regard, then the ineluctable conclusion is that no officer can 
either be appointed nor can he exercise jurisdiction unless the 
Authority acts under the rules which have been formulated for 
the purpose.  Since none exists, the act of the Authority in 
conferring jurisdiction upon the officers to issue show cause 
notices in respect of cases and areas is ultra vires the powers 
of the Authority.  It is not clear as to how the jurisdiction was 
conferred on the officers who issued show cause notices to 
petitioners.  Not only that there are no rules in place which 
lay down the decision-making process but also that, 
admittedly, the constitution of the Authority took place vide 
notification dated 01.04.2022 (produced in Court today) and 
thus no decision could have been made by a truncated 
Authority with no legal pedigree. 
7. 
Consequently, it is declared that the show cause 
notices have been issued incompetently and are without 
lawful authority and of no legal effect.  They are struck down.  
The judgments relied upon by learned counsel for the 
respondents-PRA are not relevant for the controversy in hand 
and need not be discussed in details.  It is made clear that the 

W.P No.16217 of 2020 
7 
 
 
Authority may proceed in accordance with law if the 
allegations against the petitioners are sought to be pursued. 
Petitions allowed.
