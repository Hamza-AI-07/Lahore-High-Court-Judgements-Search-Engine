Shakil-ur-Rehman son of Abdul Rehman, caste Hassan Khel, 
resident of Kotka Haji Gull Rehman, Bharrat, Tehsil and District Bannu 
(hereinafter „the appellant‟), was implicated in case FIR No.57/2015, dated 
14.08.2015, offence under Section 9(c) of the CNSA, 1997, registered with 
Police Station ANF, Lahore. He was tried by the trial court under the afore-
mentioned offence. The trial court, vide impugned judgment, convicted and 
sentenced the appellant as infra:- 
 Under Section 9(c) of the CNSA, 1997, sentenced to death with fine of 
Rs.5,00,000/- to be recovered as arrears of land revenue. 
 All assets of the appellant were directed to be forfeited in favour of 
Federal Government. 
3. 
 
Precisely the prosecution theory of the case, as set-up in the 
crime report (Exh.PD/1) lodged on the written complaint (Exh.PD) of Nazim 
Shehzad Virk, S.I (PW-2) is that, on 14.08.2015 on receipt of spy 
information, he along with Muhammad Ehsan, S.I. (PW-1) and other 
officials of ANF intercepted the car in question at Thokar Niaz Baig. The 
appellant was driving the car, who after making disclosure got recovered 17 
packets from the secret cavity of the floor of driving seat while 17 more 
packets from the secret cavity of the floor of front seat of the car. Each 
packet was weighing 1200 grams, 40.800-KGs contraband charas in totality. 
The complainant extracted 10 grams from each recovered packet and sealed 
into separate parcels for forensic analysis. The remaining bulk quantity (P-1 
and P-2) was taken into possession vide recovery memos Exh.PA and 
Exh.PB respectively. He drafted the complaint and dispatched it to the police 
station through Sabir Ali constable on the basis of which formal FIR was 
chalked out by Muhammad Hassan Anwar, S.I/Moharrar (PW-3). 
Thereafter Investigating Officer conducted the investigation, prepared rough 
site plan of the place of occurrence (Exh.PE) and recorded the statements of 
the prosecution witnesses under Section 161 Cr.P.C. On reaching the police 

CSR No.2-N/2018

(3) 
station, he handed over the case property and sample parcels to 
Moharrar/PW-3 for safe custody and onward transmission to the quarters 
concerned. During the course of investigation, having found the appellant 
connected with the crime in question, Investigating Officer got prepared 
report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. while placing his name in column No.3 and 
submitted it before the trial court. 
4. 
 
After submission of the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C, the 
trial court formally indicted the appellant, vide order dated 13.11.2015, to 
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Prosecution, in order to 
establish its case against the appellant, produced as many as four (4) 
prosecution witnesses. After completion of the prosecution evidence, 
statement of the appellant, as provided under Section 342 Cr.P.C., was 
recorded by the trial court. He professed his innocence and pleaded false 
implication in the case. Upon completion of the trial, the trial court found the 
case against the appellant proved beyond shadow of reasonable doubt, thus, 
convicted and sentenced him as mentioned and detailed above.  
5. 
 
Arguments heard, record perused. 
6. 
 
The crux of the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for 
the appellant is that the forensic report does not carry requisite protocols of 
the test as envisaged under Rule 6 of Control of Narcotic Substances 
(Government Analysts) Rules, 2001 (hereinafter „the Rules‟). Contrarily 
learned Special Prosecutor ANF contended that under Section 36 of the 
CNSA, 1997, the forensic report, unless rebutted, is conclusive. 
7. 
 
In order to evaluate the contention of the learned counsel for the 
appellant we have minutely scrutinized the record available on the file. 
Careful scrutiny of the forensic report exhibited on the record as Exh.PG/1-5 
reflects that details of protocols of tests have not been provided therein in the 
spirit of Rule 6 of the Rules. It is settled law by now that any report failing 
to describe in it, the details of the full protocols applied for the test will be 

CSR No.2-N/2018 
Crl. Appeal No.182346/2018 
Crl. Appeal No.197051/2018 
 
 
(4) 
inconclusive, defective, unreliable and will not meet the evidentiary 
presumption attached to a report of the Government Analyst under Section 
36(2) of the CNSA, 1997. In the report (Exh.PG/1-5) it is simply mentioned 
that „the submitted samples are identified to contain charas‟. Rule 6 ibid 
makes it imperative on an analyst to mention result of sample analyzed with 
full protocols applied thereon along with other details in the report issued for 
test/analysis by the Laboratory. The same has been reproduced as under for 
ready reference:- 
“6. 
Report of result of test or analysis.---After test or analysis the 
result thereof together with full protocols of the test applied, shall be 
signed in quadruplicate and supplied forthwith to the sender as specified 
in Form-II.” 
While dealing with the same question in “The STATE through Regional 
Director ANF vs. IMAM BAKHSH and others – 2018 SCMR 2039”, the 
Supreme Court held that provisions of Rule 6 of the Rules ibid are 
mandatory. The relevant extract out of the said judgment has been 
reproduced hereinafter:- 
“16. Non-compliance of Rule 6 can frustrate the purpose and object of the 
Act, i.e., control of production, processing and trafficking of narcotic 
drugs and psychotropic substances, as conviction cannot be sustained on 
a Report that is inconclusive or unreliable. The evidentiary assumption 
attached to a Report of the Government Analyst under section 36(2) of the 
Act underlines the statutory significance of the Report, therefore, details of 
the test and analysis in the shape of the protocols applied for the test 
become fundamental and go to the root of the statutory scheme. Rule 6 is, 
therefore, in the public interest and safeguards the rights of the parties. 
Any report (Form-II) failing to give details of the full protocols of the test 
applied will be inconclusive, unreliable, suspicious and untrustworthy and 
will not meet the evidentiary assumption attached to a Report of the 
Government Analyst under section 36(2). Resultantly, it will hopelessly 
fail to support conviction of the accused. This Court has already 
emphasized the importance of protocols in Ikramullah‟s case (supra).” 
The above said view has been further reiterated in the judgment reported as 
“KHAIR-UL-BASHAR vs. The STATE – 2019 SCMR 930” as infra:- 
“The general head of DETAILS OF THE RESULTS OF TESTS/ANALYSIS 
provides only for Physical Examination and Conclusion, and does not 
mention of tests or their results. This would hardly be of any significance 
unless the report provides the information required under Rule 6 in order 
to establish the culpability of the accused. Hence, for the Report to serve 

CSR No.2-N/2018 
Crl. Appeal No.182346/2018 
Crl. Appeal No.197051/2018 
 
 
(5) 
the purposes of the Act and the Rules, it must contain (i) the tests and 
analysis of the pledged drug (ii) the result of each test(s) carried out and 
(iii) the test protocols applied (the name(s) of protocols applied) to carry 
out these tests. It is important to underline that protocols are intrinsic part 
of the tests and analysis. A test conducted without following the protocols 
does not pass for a test or meet the requirement of Rule 6.” 
8. 
 
Now adverting to the contention of the learned Special 
Prosecutor that the case in hand was lodged on 14.08.2015 prior to 
pronouncements in Imam Bakhsh supra and Khair-ul-Bashar supra, 
therefore, these judgments cannot be applied retrospectively, we are of the 
considered view that such contention has no substance. These judgments of 
the Supreme Court have a retrospective effect because they declared the 
correct interpretation of an already existing provision of law. Any 
authoritative judgment is always considered as not laying down the law for 
the first time but declaring it as it should have been, or it should be 
understood to have been from its inception. It is settled law that when the 
Supreme Court interprets or declares the law, that interpretation only 
clarifies the meaning of the words already used by the legislature or the 
competent authority drafting the provisions. It stands to reason, therefore, 
that the same interpretation must be applicable not from the time when the 
judgment pronouncing such interpretation was rendered but from the time 
when the law or provision in question was enacted.1 A similar view was 
taken in Shahid Pervaiz2.  
9. 
 
Learned Special Prosecutor ANF, while placing reliance on 
Shafa Ullah Khan3 contended that in view of provisions of Section 36 of the 
CNSA, 1997 unless rebutted, the report of Government Analyst is 
conclusive, therefore, vires of the forensic report exhibited on the record as 
Exh.PG/1-5 cannot be questioned at appellate stage. While evaluating the 
contention of learned Special Prosecutor we have respectfully gone through 
                                       
1 Mir MUHAMMAD KHAN and 2 others vs. HAIDER and others – PLD 2020 Supreme Court 233 
2 SHAHID PERVAIZ vs. EJAZ AHMAD and others – 2017 SCMR 206 
3 SHAFA ULLAH KHAN vs. The STATE and another – 2021 SCMR 2005 

CSR No.2-N/2018 
Crl. Appeal No.182346/2018 
Crl. Appeal No.197051/2018 
 
 
(6) 
the judgment handed down in Shafa Ullah Khan supra; wherein it was ruled 
as infra:- 
“In the present case in the report of Agency, the test applied, protocol and 
result of the test has been mentioned however detail of the protocol is not 
mentioned. This matter was further clarified that if there is any ambiguity in 
the report the same may be resolved by the trial court by exercising its powers 
under proviso to section 510 of the Criminal Procedure Code. So we have not 
found any ambiguity in the Agency‟s report and there is no infirmity in the 
impugned judgment and the conclusion drawn by the courts below regarding 
the guilt of the appellant is not open to any exception.” 
In the supra judgment though details of protocols were not given, however, 
test applied as well as protocol and result of the test were clearly mentioned 
whereas in the instant case, in the forensic report, neither details of test have 
been cited nor any protocols have been provided rather it is only mentioned 
that “the submitted samples are identified to contain charas”. Thus, ratio in 
Shafa Ullah Khan supra is not applicable in the present case. 
10. 
 
It is cardinal principle of criminal justice system that the case 
carrying stringent sentence must be proved through cogent evidence in order 
to rule out the possibility of false implication. Respectful reliance in this 
regard can be placed on the ratio decidendi of Supreme Court of Pakistan in 
the case of AMEER ZEB vs. THE STATE - PLD 2012 Supreme Court 380 
wherein it was ruled as under:- 
“Punishments provided in the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 were 
quite stringent and long, if not harsh, and, thus, a special care had to be taken 
that a court trying such an offence had to be convinced that the entire quantity 
allegedly recovered from the accused person‟s possession was indeed 
narcotic substance. We, reverently and respectfully, tend to agree with the 
latter view and would like to add that the rule of thumb for safe 
administration of criminal justice is: the harsher the sentence the stricter the 
standard of proof.” 
11. 
 
Moreover, it is golden principle of criminal law that a single 
circumstance creating reasonable doubt would be sufficient to smash the 
veracity of prosecution case and sufficient to extend the benefit of doubt in 
favour of the accused not as a matter of grace or concession but as of right. 
Reference can be made to QAISARULLAH and others vs. THE STATE – 
2009 SCMR 579.

12. 
 
In sequel to what has been discussed above, this Court is fully 
convinced that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against the 
appellant beyond shadow of reasonable doubt, therefore, Crl. Appeal 
No.182346/2018 titled „Shakil-ur-Rehman vs. The State & another‟ is 
allowed, as a consequence whereof the conviction and sentence recorded by 
the trial court, vide the impugned judgment, are set-aside and while 
extending the benefit of doubt, the appellant is acquitted of the charge. He 
is directed to be released forthwith if not required to be detained in any other 
criminal case.  
13. 
 
Capital Sentence Reference No.2-N/2018 forwarded by the trial 
court fails, which is answered in the negative. Death sentence awarded to 
the convict is not confirmed. 
14. 
 
As far as Crl. Appeal No.197051/2018, whereby the order qua 
handing over the car in question (P-3) to its real owner has been questioned, 
is concerned, for the reasons recorded in the preceding paragraphs when the 
prosecution couldn‟t prove its case against the respondent No.1/convict 
namely Shakil-ur-Rehman, the instant appeal is squarely devoid of any 
merits, which is accordingly dismissed.
