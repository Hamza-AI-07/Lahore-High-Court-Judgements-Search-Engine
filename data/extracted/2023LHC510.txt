Mr.

Advocate 
for 
respondent No.1. 
Through this civil revision, the petitioner has 
challenged the validity of judgment & decree dated

filed by respondent No.1 was decreed and judgment & 
decree dated 10.11.2021 passed by the learned

received result card from the petitioner /University of 
the Punjab while obtaining 414 marks out of 800 
marks. Respondent No.1 filed an application for 
issuance of original degree but the petitioner & 
respondent No.2/defendants No.1 & 2 refused to 
deliver the degree. He requested that a direction may 
be passed to the petitioner/ defendants to deliver the 
degree. Petitioner & proforma respondent No.2/ 
defendants No.1 & 2 filed contesting written statement 
raising objection that respondent No.1 has no cause of 
action and locus standi to file the suit. Respondent 
No.1 committed forgery in the award list of English 
Paper-A as rubbing had been applied by interpolation 
of digit 13 marks into 43 marks with connivance of 
some officials of the University. The learned trial court 
framed issues, recorded evidence of both the parties 
and vide judgment & decree dated 28.09.2020 decreed 
the suit for declaration filed by respondent No.1 and 
directed the petitioner and proforma respondents to 
hand over the degree of B.A. Petitioner feeling

5. 
Admittedly, respondent No.1/ plaintiff appeared 
in Second Annual Examination for Bachelor of Art 
(B.A) vide Roll No.14228 with the Registration 
No.91-z-1152 and passed the exam by securing 414 
marks. Accordingly, the petitioner /University of 
Punjab issued him a result card showing 414 marks out 
of 800 marks. 
6. 
Petitioner-University produced copy of register of 
University of Punjab (Exh.D7), which shows  “Result 
Statement for the Bachelor of Arts (Pass Course) I/II 
Examination 1991” held in January 1992. As per Ex.D7 
the respondent in English Subject had obtained 72 Marks 
(Paper-A 43 Marks and Paper-B 29 marks i.e. Total  72 
Marks) in this way, he obtained total marks 414 out of 
800 marks and passed the examination in 2nd Division. 
From bare perusal of above Ex.D-7, it reveals that there 
is no visible tampering, erasing or manipulation on the 
said record and even if there was any doubt it was 
appropriate for the petitioner to obtain opinion of an 
expert of the relevant field in this regard but this  

Civil Revision No.78898/2021

exercise was not done. The petitioner in its official 
gazette declared respondent No.1 as successful 
candidate. Under Chapter-VI of the Calendar of the 
University of the Punjab, 1998 the Syndicate has the 
jurisdiction to quash the result or withdraw the degree 
within three years from the date of declaration of 
result. For ready reference, Chapter-VI of The 
Calendar of the University of the Punjab for the year 
1998 is reproduced as under:- 
“CHAPTER VI----GENERAL REGULATION 
EMPOWERING 
THE 
SYNDICATE 
TO 
QUASH THE RESULT OR WITHDRAW THE 
DEGREE, DIPLOMA OR CERTIFICATE OF A 
CANDIDATE. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained 
in the Regulations, the Syndicate shall have the 
power to quash the result or withdraw the Degree, 
Diploma or Certificate of a candidate after it has 
been declared or awarded, as the case may be:- 
(1) if he has been disqualified for using unfair 
means in the examination; or 
(2) if a mistake is found in the compilation or 
declaration of his result; or 
(3) if it is found that he was not eligible to 
appear in the examination. 
Provided that the order of quashing the result under 
paras.(2) and (3) is issued not later than 3 years from 
the date of the declaration of the result of the 
examination concerned. 
Provided further that in quashing the result of 
candidate under (2) and (3) above, the University 
declares as „failed‟ a candidate, who was previously 
declared to have passed in an examination, the 
Syndicate may, after considering the circumstances 
of the case, take such action as it may deem 
necessary to give to the candidate the benefit of any 
privilege that he may have acquired by studying in 
the next higher class in a recognised institution or 
taking an examination conducted by the University.”  
  
 
 
(emphasis supplied)    

Civil Revision No.78898/2021

As per available record, the result of respondent was 
declared in 1992 but neither any proceedings regarding 
erasing or manipulation in the marks were initiated 
within the stipulated period against the respondent nor 
any departmental proceeding were initiated by the 
petitioner against any delinquent official. The copy of 
Register of University of Punjab (Exh.D7) is an 
authentic proof in this regard that the respondent 
No.1/plaintiff obtained 414 marks and there is no 
tempering available on it. Once the result gazette was 
issued the University was/is debarred to quash the 
result after the lapse of period of three years. Reliance 
is placed on the cases titled as Shahid Saleem Vs. 
Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education & 2 
Others (1987 MLD 3053) and Tariq Mahmood Vs. 
Vice-Chancellor, University of the Punjab, Lahore & 
Another (2022 MLD 155). As such the learned courts 
below rightly passed the impugned judgments & 
decrees and no illegality has been committed.  
7. 
When confronted, learned counsel for the 
petitioner has failed to point out any illegality or 
material irregularity, misreading and non-reading of 
evidence in the impugned judgments & decrees passed 
by the learned Courts below and has also not identified 
any jurisdictional defect. The concurrent findings of 
fact are against the petitioner which do not call for any 

Civil Revision No.78898/2021 
7 
 
interference by this Court in exercise of its revisional 
jurisdiction. Reliance is placed on the case titled as 
Mst. Zaitoon Begum Vs. Nazar Hussain & Another 
(2014 SCMR 1469). 
8. 
In view of above, this civil revision is dismissed 
being devoid of any force with no order as to cost.
