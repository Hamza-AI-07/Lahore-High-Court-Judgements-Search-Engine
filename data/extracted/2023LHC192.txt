FAROOQ HAIDER, J.:- Through instant revision petition, Zaheer 
Ahmed (present petitioner/complainant) has challenged the vires of order                
dated: 06.04.2022 passed by learned Judge Special Court (OIB-II), Lahore, 
whereby application filed by present petitioner for having comparison of 
signatures of his deceased father namely Ch. Muhammad Rafique, was 
dismissed.  
2.  
Necessary facts for disposal of instant revision petition are that (Zaheer 
Ahmad (present petitioner) filed complaint under Section: 5 of Offences in 
respect of Banks (Special Court) Ordinance, 1984 with the allegation that father 
of present petitioner/complainant namely Ch. Muhammad Rafique died                    
on 17.09.2020, who in his life time maintained two bank accounts i.e. first 
Account No.0020-00888361-0001, First Women Bank, Gujranwala Branch and 
second Account No.PK36HBB 0006827900918503, Habib Bank Ltd. G.T. Road 
Branch, Gujranwala; before death of father of the complainant, his age was more 
than 80-years, he was an ailing person, unable to move/walk himself and even his 
hand was fractured, hence, he was also unable to sign any document; after death 
of his father, petitioner/complainant approached respondents No.6 and 7 (both 
bank officials) for provision of statements of accounts of his deceased father but 
they were reluctant to provide the same and in this regard, he also filed a suit for 

Criminal Revision No.23556/2022 
2
providing statements of accounts and ultimately when statements of accounts 
were provided to the petitioner, then it revealed to him that accused persons 
illegally and unlawfully withdrew huge amount of approximately Rs.44.2 million 
from aforementioned bank accounts of his father when he was bedridden and 
even not able to sign any cheque; aforementioned complaint was entrusted to 
learned Special Judge (OIB-II), Lahore, who after recording cursory statement of 
the petitioner, summoned accused persons for facing the trial; thereafter, 
petitioner filed an application for having comparison of signatures of his 
deceased father with the following prayer: - 
“It is humbly submitted that the above said application may kindly be 
accepted and the manager of the above said two banks may kindly be 
directed to produce the said cheques and the SS Cards as lying in their 
bank in original form before this court for further transmitting to PFSL, 
so that the admitted signatures as lying on the SS cards may kindly be 
compared with the signature lying on the said cheques which are bogus 
and made by all the accused. It is further submitted that in this regard 
letter be written to the head of the PFSL to prepare the comparison 
report as early as possible.”  
 
which was dismissed vide order dated: 06.04.2022 (impugned herein) 
passed by learned Judge Special Court (OIB-II), Lahore.  
2.  
Learned counsel for the petitioner in support of instant revision 
petition submits that impugned order is against the law and facts of the case; 
further submits that since huge amount was withdrawn from two bank 
accounts of father of present petitioner/ complainant while putting forged 
signatures on the disputed cheques, therefore, it was necessary for having 
comparison of the signatures of his deceased father for just decision of the 
case. Learned counsel further goes on to add that impugned order is not 
sustainable in the eyes of law rather liable to be set-aside.  
3.   
Learned Assistant Attorney General, vice learned counsel for respondent 
No.6 as well as learned counsel for respondent No.7 while supporting impugned 
order have prayed for dismissal of this revision petition.  
4.   
After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner, vice learned counsel 
for respondent No.6, learned counsel for respondent No.7, learned 
Assistant Attorney General and going through the available record with 
their able assistance, it has been noticed that since entire controversy/dispute 
in the case in hand revolves around the impugned signatures of Ch. Muhammad 
Rafique (deceased father of present petitioner/complainant) on the cheques 
which were encashed from the bank because it is case of present 
petitioner/complainant that signatures on the disputed cheques are not of his 
father rather same are forged, therefore, comparison of signatures available on 
said cheques with the admitted signatures of deceased father of the complainant, 
is necessary/essential for just decision of the case.  It is well settled principle of 

Criminal Revision No.23556/2022

law that criminal justice system is not adversarial rather inquisitorial and 
Court has to reach at just decision of the case; any piece of evidence which is 
essential for just decision of the case, has to be brought on record irrespective 
of the fact that either it favours one party or goes against other; similarly, 
filling lacuna in the case is immaterial if said piece of evidence is otherwise 
necessary for securing ends of justice; in this regard, case of “Abdul Latif 
Aasi versus The State” (2001 P.Cr.R 548) can be advantageously referred 
and its relevant paragraph No.7 is hereby  reproduced: - 
“7. 
The main plank of the petitioner’s arguments before me has 
been that in our adversarial system of justice there was no scope for 
an inquisitorial approach adopted by learned Trial Court through the 
impugned order passed by it. However, the learned counsel for the 
petitioner have failed to point out any statutory sanction for observing 
that our system of justice is adversarial and not inquisitorial. If one 
looks at the history of our judicial system one may notice that this 
concept has gradually developed therein as a rule of prudence and 
practice mainly as regards civil litigation wherein the parties to a lis 
are required to lay their respective claims before the Trial Court and 
then substantiate, the same through evidence to be led by them. There 
are indications available in the Code of Civil Procedure which support 
the perception that civil litigation in our system is, by and large, 
adversarial in nature. But even there the inherent and general powers 
of the court, and even some specific powers, sometimes cut across that 
concept. A general acceptance of that concept in the civil litigation is, 
even otherwise, understandable. In  a civil lis, more often than not, it 
is the parties to the lis alone who are interested in its outcome and 
effect. This cannot be said to be true for a criminal case wherein an 
offence committed by an individual is considered to be an offence not 
only against his victim but also against the whole society and the 
State. Thus, in a criminal case an intentional or an un-intentional 
lapse on the part of the complainant, the Investigating Officer or the 
prosecuting counsel is not to be allowed to stand in the way of a 
Trial Court to rectify that lapse by calling in evidence on its own if 
such evidence can have a bearing on the determination of guilt or 
innocence of the accused person. Such a power has to be conceded 
to a Criminal Court in the larger interest of the community at large. 
Looked at in this context the stage of a trial appears to be irrelevant 
to an exercise of such a power of the Court and the only factor 
relevant to the exercise of such a power cannot be other than the 
relevance of the evidence called.”     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (emphasis added) 
It goes without saying that Ch.1-E of the Volume III of Lahore High Court 
Rules and Orders deals with recording of evidence in criminal cases and 
relevant portion of its Rule 2 clearly reflects as under: - 
“2.    Duty of Court to elucidate facts.---................................................ 
…………………………………………………………………........................ 
..............a Judge in a Criminal trial is not merely a disinterested 
auditor of the contest between the prosecution and the defence, but it 
is his duty to elucidate points left in obscurity by either side, 
intentionally or unintentionally, to come to a clear understanding of 
the actual events that occurred and to remove obscurities as far as 
possible.  The wide powers given to the court by [Article 161 of the 
Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984] ***[…] should be judiciously utilized for 
this purpose when necessary”. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
         (emphasis added) 

Criminal Revision No.23556/2022

Similarly, Article 161 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 is also relevant 
and concerned portion of the same is hereby reproduced: -  
“161. Judge’s power to put question or order production.---The 
Judge may, in order to discover or to obtain  proper proof of relevant 
facts, ask any question he pleases in any form, at any time, of any 
witness, or of the parties about any fact relevant or irrelevant, and 
may order the production of any document or thing and neither the 
parties nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection to any 
such question or order, nor, without the leave of the Court, to cross-
examine any witness upon any answer given in reply to any such 
question:”  
 
Furthermore, Section: 94 Cr.P.C. is also relevant, therefore, its concerned 
portion is also being reproduced: - 
“94.   Summons to produce document or other thing.—(1) Whenever 
any Court, or any officer in charge of a police-station considers that 
the production of any document or other thing is necessary or 
desirable for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other 
proceeding under this Code by or before such Court or officer, such 
Court may issue a summons, or such officer a written order, to the 
person in whose possession or power such document or thing is 
believed to be, requiring him to attend and produce it, or to produce it, 
at the time and place stated in the summons or order:” 
 
As far as filling lacuna left by any party is concerned, if such evidence/material is 
necessary for just decision of the case, then it becomes mandatory for the Court 
to summon and examine such evidence/material; in this regard, guidance has 
been sought from the case of “Muhammad Azam versus Muhammad Iqbal 
and others” (PLD 1984 Supreme Court 95) and relevant portions from its 
Pages No. 118, 121 and 122 are hereby reproduced: - 
      (Page 118)  
“The duty nevertheless lay squarely on the trial Court to 
summon the entire available evidence on this controversy 
and record/ admit the same by virtue of power under 
section 540, Cr.P.C. It reads as follows: 
“540.  Power to summon material witness or examine 
person present. Any Court may, at any stage of any 
inquiry, trial of other proceeding under this Code, 
summon any person as a witness, or examine any 
person in attendance, though not summoned as a 
witness, or recall and re-examine any person already 
examined; and the Court shall summon and examine or 
recall and re-examine any such person if his evidence 
appears to it essential to the just decision of the case.” 
 
 
 
This provision is divided into two parts: one where it is 
only discretionary for the Court to summon a Court 
witness suo motu or on application, and the second part 
where it is mandatory for the Court to do so. The main 
condition to be satisfied with regard to the second part is 
that the evidence to be summoned under this part should 
appear to the Court to be essential to the just decision of 
the case.”  
 
     (Page 121) 
“It needs to be observed that for purpose of acting under 
section 540, Cr.P.C. (whether the first or second part), it 
is permissible to look into the material not formally 
admitted in evidence, whether it is available in the 

Criminal Revision No.23556/2022

records of the judicial file or in the police file or 
elsewhere. The perusal of both these records would show 
that if evidence, in connection with the items already 
noticed, would have been properly entertained the 
reasoning and decision of the learned two Courts might 
have been different. 
 
Sometimes apprehension is expressed that any action by 
the trial Court under section 540, Criminal Procedure 
Code would amount to filing the gaps and omissions in 
the version or evidence of one or the other party. It may 
straightaway be observed that in so far as the second part 
of section 540 goes, it does not admit any such 
qualification. Instead, even if the action thereunder is of 
the type mentioned, the Court shall act in accordance with 
the dictates of the law. In fact the Court has no discretion 
in this behalf. It is obligatory on it to admit evidence 
thereunder if it is essential for the just decision of the 
case.”        
  
                                                                          (emphasis added) 
 
 
       (Page 122) 
“In yet another case Rashid Ahmad v. The State (1), this 
Court made it more clear that “a criminal Court is fully 
within its rights in receiving fresh evidence even after both 
the sides have closed their evidence and the case, is 
adjourned for judgment, for, till then the case is still 
pending. The only question therefore, is as to whether in 
the interest of fairness further opportunity should have 
been given to the accused”; and, it was held that “there is 
no bar to the taking of additional evidence in the interest 
of justice, at any stage of inquiry or trial as provided by 
the provisions of section 540, Cr.P.C.”  In these cases if 
the question regarding so-called filling of the gaps would 
have been raised more squarely, the answer in view of 
what has been noticed above would have been the same 
as already rendered; namely, that if it is essential for the 
just decision of the case, then the same is the command 
of the law under the second part of section 540, Cr.P.C. 
It would not be possible to canvass that when the action 
under the said provision amounted to so-called filling of 
a gap, the Court would for this reason, avoid its duty to 
admit the additional evidence. Two more decisions by 
this Court as illustrative of the practice, may also be 
noted. There are: Bashir Ahmad v. The State and 
another (2), and Yasin alias Cheema and another vs. The 
State (3).”   
                                  
  
                                                                  (emphasis added) 
  
In this regard, further guidance has been sought from the case of             
“The State Vs. Muhammad Yaqoob and others” (2001 SCMR 308) 
and relevant portions from its Page No.325 are hereby reproduced: - 
“It is thus manifest that calling of additional evidence is 
not always conditioned on the defence or prosecution 
making application for this purpose but it is the duty of 
the Court to do complete justice between the parties and 
the carelessness or ignorance of one party or the other or 
the delay that may result in the conclusion of the case 
should not be a hindrance in achieving that object.”  
  
 
 
 
 
 
    (emphasis added) 
 

Criminal Revision No.23556/2022

“It is correct that every criminal case has its own  
facts and, therefore, no hard and fast rule or criteria for 
general application can be laid down in this respect but if 
on the facts of a particular case it appears essential to the 
Court that additional evidence is necessary for just 
decision of the case then under second part of section 540, 
Cr.P.C. it is obligatory on the Court to examine such a 
witness ignoring technical/formal objection in this respect 
as to do justice and to avoid miscarriage of justice”. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    (emphasis added) 
 
Nutshell of the above discussion is that in “peculiar facts & circumstances” of 
the case, impugned order dated: 06.04.2022 passed by learned Judge Special 
Court (OIB-II), Lahore is not warranted by law, hence, same is hereby set-
aside. Resultantly, application filed by present petitioner/complainant for 
having comparison of signatures of his deceased father, is “allowed” and 
learned trial court is directed to have comparison of signatures of Ch. 
Muhammad Rafique (deceased father of present petitioner/complainant) 
available on the disputed cheques with the admitted signatures of said Ch. 
Muhammad Rafique available on SS Cards from Punjab Forensic Science 
Agency, Lahore, in accordance with law. Needless to add that observations 
mentioned above are only meant for the purpose of decision of this revision 
petition. Instant revision petition stands accepted/allowed.
