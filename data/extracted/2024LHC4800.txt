Instant Execution Appeal is directed 
against orders dated 05.10.2022 and 13.10.2022, in terms of former 
order objections against auction sale were dismissed, in wake of the 
failure of the appellants to fulfil the condition of deposit 20% of the 
amounts realized at the sale; and by virtue of latter one, auction sale 
was confirmed in favour of the decree holder bank – respondent No.1.  
2. 
Auction sale was confirmed in the backdrop of following facts; 
Suit instituted by respondent No.1 - [“decree holder Bank”] -, was 
decreed vide judgment and decree dated 07.03.2017, where-after 
those proceedings stood converted into execution, as provided in law. 
Thereafter, decree holder Bank sought execution through the

intervention of the Court. Auction schedule was approved, in terms 
whereof auction was to be held on 18.07.2022. Reserve price of the 
assets, subjected to prospective auction comprised of land, building 
and machinery, was settled at Rs.513,000,000/-. On 18.07.2022, 
auction proceedings commenced. Single bidder was registered – 
[namely, Abid Hussain] – but same had refused to make any bid. 
Court 
Auctioneers 
(“the 
Auctioneers”) 
adjourned 
auction 
proceedings for 22.07.2022, claiming powers under Rule (69) of 
Order XXI of Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (“Code, 1908”).  
  
On 22.07.2022, previously registered bidder was present but 
same had again refused to tender any bid. Auction was again 
adjourned for 12.08.2022. On 04.08.2022, respondent No.1 – [Decree 
holder Bank] - moved application with the Court for permission to 
participate in the auction, which permission was granted vide order of 
10.08.2022. Auction was conducted on 12.08.2022. As per the report 
of the proceedings dated 12.08.2022, Mr. Abid Hussain was declared 
as successful purchaser, out of three bidders, including decree holder 
Bank. Successful purchaser did not deposit 25% of the purchase 
money on 12.08.2022, on the pretext of closing of Banks after 5:00 
pm. Auctioneers extended time for deposit till 15.08.2022, by 10:30 
A.M. Auctioneers intimated the bidders that in case successful 
purchaser failed to deposit 25% of the purchase money by the time 
granted, second highest bidder would be asked to deposit 25% of the 
purchase money. And further declared that in case of failure of second 
highest bidder, third highest bidder, the decree holder Bank, would be 

EFA No.30/2022

offered the option to purchase against the bid submitted on 12.08.2022. 
It is pertinent to mention that successful purchaser offered bid of 
Rs.517.700 Million; second bidder made bid of Rs.517.500 Million 
and third bidder – the decree holder Bank – gave bid of Rs.513.600 
Million [barely Rs.600,000/- over the reserve price].  
  
On 15.08.2022, upon default by the successful purchaser and 
second highest bidder, the bid offered by decree holder Bank was 
accepted, whereupon decree holder claimed benefit of set-off against 
the payment of 25% of the purchase money. Objections were filed by 
the appellants and vide order of 21.09.2022 Court directed deposit of 
20% of the amounts realized at the auction. Order was affirmed by 
learned Division Bench of this Court upon dismissing appeal bearing 
EFA No.21/2022, vide order of 26.09.2022. On 05.10.2022 objections 
were dismissed for non-compliance to meet condition of deposit of 
20%. On 13.10.2022 auction sale was confirmed in favour of the 
decree holder bank. Hence, this Appeal. 
3. 
Foundational premises of the argument of the appellants rest on 
the ground that the Auctioneers had violated the mandate of Rule (84) 
of Order XXI of the Code, 1908. It is submitted that upon default in 
the payment of 25% of the purchase money, by the successful bidder, 
auction proceedings stood aborted and thereafter, the Auctioneers 
were required to re-sell the property, instead of offering the choice to 
the second and, thereafter, to the third highest bidder. It is emphasized 
that the expression ‘forthwith be re-sold’ implies conducting of fresh 
proceedings / bidding. Learned counsel pleads causing of substantial 

EFA No.30/2022

injury to the appellants upon non-adherence of the statutory 
requirements. Following case-laws are cited to support the 
submissions, reported as, Mst. Nadia Malik V. Messrs Makki 
Chemical Industries Pvt. Ltd. through Chief Executive and others 
(2011 SCMR 1675), Afzal Maqsood Butt V. Banking Court No.2, 
Lahore and 8 others (PLD 2005 Supreme Court 470), Muhammad 
Ashraf and others V. U.B.L and others (2019 SCMR 1004), 
Muhammad Ali Asghar Sabir Raja V. Mst. Sajida Bashir and others 
(2006 SCMR 801), Mst. Samrana Nawaz and others V. M.C.B. Bank 
Ltd and others (PLD 2021 Supreme Court 581) and Messrs Habib 
and Company and others V. Muslim Commercial Bank Limited and 
others (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 227). 
4. 
Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.1 – auction 
purchaser-cum-decree holder Bank – submit that decree holder Bank 
had participated in the bidding upon seeking written permission of the 
Court, which was granted on 10.08.2022. Adds that grant of 
permission in terms of Rule (72) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908 
entitles the decree holder Bank to claim set-off against the payment of 
purchase money, in which case Court possessed requisite discretion to 
dispense with the requirements of sub-rule (1) of Rule (84) of Order 
XXI of the Code, 1908. Further submits that objections to the auction 
were not entertainable once the appellants failed to deposit 20% of the 
amounts realized at auction sale. Adds that order, directing deposit of 
20%, was unsuccessfully challenged through appeal, bearing EFA 
No.21/2022, which was dismissed in limine vide order of 26.09.2022. 

EFA No.30/2022

Learned counsel emphasized that essentiality of fulfilment of the 
condition of deposit of 20%, before hearing the objections, was 
affirmed in the case of Mst. Samrana Nawaz and others V. MCB Bank 
Ltd and others (PLD 2024 Supreme Court 873), and various 
paragraphs of the decision are read.  
  
On the question of re-sale of the property, once successful 
bidder failed to deposit 25% of the purchase money, it is submitted 
that the auction proceedings did not terminate at any stage but were 
simply adjourned, in exercise of discretion under Rule (69) of Order 
XXI of the Code, 1908, and no illegality was committed while 
offering option to the succeeding bidders, which manifest continuity 
of the auction proceedings without any break, providing no occasion 
for re-sale. Add that since auction proceedings were not adjourned 
beyond the 30 days limit, therefore, there was no necessity of issuing 
fresh proclamation of sale and re-conducting the auction proceedings. 
5. 
Heard. Record perused. 
6. 
Primary questions that arose for determination are, firstly, the 
effect and consequence of failure to fulfill the condition to deposit of 
20% of the amounts realized; and secondly, an equally significant 
question, what is the scope, effect and consequence of alleged non-
compliance of requirements under Rule (84) of Order XXI of the 
Code, 1908. Likely determination of aforesaid questions requires 
findings that whether non-compliance of mandate of Rule (84) of 
Order XXI of the Code, 1908 is so gross an illegality, falling in the 
realm of nullity, that irrespective of non-deposit of 20%, auction sale 

EFA No.30/2022  
                        
 
6
could be declared invalid / void, simplicitor for non-compliance of 
Rule (84), ibid. 
7. 
Before we proceed to adjudicate legal questions, it is 
appropriate to highlight / reiterate critical facts, that provoked our 
thinking and persuaded us to examine, threadbare, the allegation of 
non-compliance of statutory requirements under Rule (84) of Order 
XXI of the Code, 1908. It calls for attention that auction proceedings 
were scheduled for 18.07.2022, as per approved terms of proclamation 
of sale, claimed to have had published in newspapers having wide 
circulation, for the information of the public. Auction proceedings 
commenced on 18.07.2022 but the Auctioneers had adjourned it for 
22.07.2022, on the premise that only one bidder had registered, who 
was not willing to make bid. Whether adjournment of proceedings 
justified on this ground? In normal circumstances, absence of bid is a 
ground to terminate proceedings, and seek fresh approval of the terms 
of sale from the Court. There is nothing available on record, nor 
alleged, that from 18.07.2022 to 22.07.2022 what steps / efforts were 
taken to ensure increased participation of prospective bidders in the 
auction.  
  
On 22.07.2022 same position continued, and auction was 
adjourned for 12.08.2022 – at that point of time the decree holder 
Bank had not demonstrated intent to bid in the auction. Was another 
adjournment justified when no bid was available with the Auctioneers. 
Later, the decree holder Bank submitted application on 04.08.2022, 
seeking permission to participate in the bidding, adjourned for 

EFA No.30/2022  
                        
 
7
12.08.2022. Permission was granted on 10.08.2022. On 12.08.2022 
auction proceedings, either commenced or re-commenced, were 
conducted. Evidently, three bidders had participated. Abid Hussain, 
previously registered bidder, made highest bid, who was declared 
successful purchaser, against quoted bid of Rs.517.700 Million. 
Successful purchaser failed to deposit 25% of purchase money on 
12.08.2022, who again failed on 15.08.2022. Were the Auctioneers 
justified, in terms of Rule (84) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908, to 
offer option to purchase to second highest bidder, and upon his failure 
to extend option to purchase to third highest bidder [decree holder 
Bank] – the only bidder standing. The decree holder Bank showed 
willingness to purchase and was declared as successful purchaser on 
15.08.2022.  
 
Our first concern is whether adjourning the auction proceedings, 
repeatedly was a coincidence or facilitation to the decree holder Bank 
to re-visit its strategy and take advantage of the continuing auction 
proceedings – which commenced on 18.07.2022 and apparently 
concluded on 15.08.2022. Our second concern is that when, on 
18.07.2022, only one, an unwilling bidder, was available, what 
persuaded the Auctioneers to adjourn auction proceedings, firstly, for 
four days and thereafter till 12.08.2022 – presence of single, unwilling 
bidder, affords no plausible basis to adjourn the auction, when nothing 
was otherwise done to ensure reasonable participation of bidder, to 
meet requirements of a public auction. Apparently, probable outcome 
of repeated adjournments was discovery of second highest bidder and 

EFA No.30/2022

re-thinking of strategy by the decree holder Bank - third highest 
bidder. We acknowledge that Rule (69) of Order XXI of the Code, 
1908 extends discretion to the Auctioneers to adjourn the auction but 
then plausible reasons / explanation must be provided, but none found 
in the auction report. The Auctioneers had discussed previous 
unscrupulous conduct of Abid Hussain, highest bidder, but still 
adjourned the auction proceedings twice. We have discussed the facts 
appearing from the record and do not intend attributing insinuations. 
Circumstances narrated provided enough ground to adjudicate and 
examine the effect of non-compliance of mandate of Rule (84) of 
Order XXI of the Code, 1908, which appears to be a bigger lapse / 
illegality, in the context of aforesaid unique facts.  
8. 
Before discussing the effect and repercussions of non-
compliance of Rule (84), ibid, it is expedient to reproduce text thereof, 
before and after the amendment by the Lahore High Court, which read 
as, 
Before amendment:  
“Deposit by purchaser and re-sale on default.-(1) On every sale of 
immovable property the person declared to be the purchaser shall 
pay immediately after such declaration a deposit of twenty-five per 
cent, on the amount of his purchase-money to the officer or other 
person conducting the sale, and in default of such deposit, the 
property shall forthwith be re-sold”. 
(2) 
Where the decree-holder is the purchaser and is entitled to 
set-off the purchase money under rule 72, the Court may dispense 
with the requirements of this rule”. 
After amendment:[Effective from 01.11.2020] 
(1) “On every sale of immovable property, the person declared to be 
the purchaser shall pay to the officer or other person conducting the 
sale the amount equal to the reserve price of the property through 
pay order or bank draft or banker’s cheque immediately after such 

EFA No.30/2022  
                        
 
9
declaration and in case such payment is not so made, the property 
shall forthwith be resold in the manner provided under this Order”. 
9. 
Argument that where the decree holder Bank was successful 
purchaser, requirements under sub-rule (1) of Rule (84) of Order XXI 
of the Code, 1908, could be dispensed with is grossly flawed. 
Notwithstanding, the circumstances where successful purchaser is a 
decree holder, the concession available under sub-rule (2) of Rule (84) 
of Order XXI of the Code, 1908 is confined to the extent of 
requirement of deposit of 25% of the purchase money and does not 
spill to prejudice statutory direction regarding forthwith re-sale, if 
payment of purchase money was not deposited by declared successful 
purchaser. In case where decree holder is the successful purchaser and 
decretal amount is more than the bid offered and accepted, no 
occasion would arise for re-sale – construing default in such cases 
tantamount to an absurdity. Question of default under Rule (84) of 
Order XXI of the Code, 1908 would arise if decree holder bids and 
declared successful, and the decretal amount claimed is less than the 
bid price, or even less than 25% of the purchase money, in such case 
non-payment of the amount by the decree holder would obligate the 
Auctioneer to re-sell the property. It appears that distinguishing 
features of the case and extent of illegalities escaped attention of the 
Court, while confirming sale. Once declared successful purchaser – 
[Abid Hussain] – failed to arrange 25% of the purchase money, the 
auction, for all intents and purposes, aborts. Law does not envisage 
the option of revisiting the bidder’s list for picking and offering option 
to purchase to the succeeding bidder(s), lower on the list. Offering of 
such option to the second highest bidder does not constitute re-sale 

EFA No.30/2022  
                        
 
10
but tantamount to continue or resurrect an otherwise aborted sale / 
proceedings. Rule (84) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908 does not 
envisage or permits the practice of continuing further with an aborted 
sale, once default was committed by the successful purchaser, in terms 
thereof. By offering the option to purchase to the lower and then to the 
lowest bidder tantamount to hedge the success of the auction, which is 
not required under Rule (84) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908. 
Whether the Auctioneers were required to ensure the success of the 
auction even by conspicuously ignoring the mandate of law. This is an 
illegality. And mere invocation of sub-rule (2) of Rule (84) of Order 
XXI of the Code, 1908, in the facts and circumstances, does not 
dispense with the necessity of forthwith re-sale upon happening of an 
event of default – failure of declared successful purchaser to deposit 
25% of the purchase money. Expression re-sale of the property has to 
be examined in the context of Rule (84), ibid, which does not imply 
sale of property to the next bidder in the bidder’s list – if that was 
intended it would have been expressed through original Rule (84) or 
by virtue of Lahore High Court amendment. Hypothetically, if there 
are two bidders and if the highest bidder fails to deposit 25% of the 
purchase money, as required under Rule (84) of Order XXI of the 
Code, 1908, would it imply that the other bidder would claim right to 
purchase the property ipso-facto. No! Second bidder had no 
entitlement in such circumstances, who may participate in fresh sale 
proceedings and bid. Hence, offering of option to the second highest 
and thereafter to third highest bidder is contrary to the mandate of 
Rule (84) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908. An aborted auction sale 

EFA No.30/2022  
                        
 
11
cannot be resumed / resurrected upon proceeding to exhaust the list of 
bidders, in descending order. This manifests clear non-compliance and 
violation of mandatory requirement of law - Rule (84) of Order XXI 
of the Code, 1908.     
10. 
There is another aspect of the matter. Whether sale to single 
bidder is lawful and meets essential requirements of a Public Auction? 
In view of the facts of the case, once declared successful bidder had 
defaulted and likewise, second highest bidder was declared defaulter 
in the context of Rule (84) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908, and both 
the bids were cancelled - without prejudice to the observations 
recorded that offering of option to purchase to the second highest 
bidder is inherently illegal – only one bidder remained available – 
decree holder Bank.  Were the Auctioneers justified to offer option to 
purchase to the last standing bidder – in such circumstances, when 
there is single bidder left, re-sale of property would otherwise be an 
impossibility. There is no dearth of case-laws on the point that 
presence of single bidder or availability of single bid is contrary to the 
spirit of public auction. Guidance is solicited from the cases reported 
as Muhammad Shoaib Arshad and another V. Federation of Pakistan 
through Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice Human Rights and 
Parliamentary Affairs and 4 others (2020 CLD 638) and Al-Hadi Rice 
Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive and 4 others V. MCB Bank 
Limited and 6 others (2023 CLD 85).  
  
In a recent decision by the Apex Court of the Country, in the 
case of Summit Bank Limited, Lahore V. Messrs M. M. Brothers, 

EFA No.30/2022  
                        
 
12
Proprietorship Concern through Proprietor and others (2023 CLD 
297), significance of competitive bidding was reiterated, which 
relevant observations are reproduced hereunder, 
“11.  It is well-known that an auction is a form of sale of 
property to the highest bidder, usually as a result of 
competition between bidders who compete among themselves 
by offering competitive prices and the highest bid is normally 
approved, but according to the established norms and 
standards, the presence of at least two potential bidders is 
indispensable to carry out an auction in which competitive 
bidding is a key factor for free and transparent public 
auction…….”  
[Emphasis supplied] 
11. 
On the question of invalidity of auction sale once default in 
terms of Rule (84) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908 had occasioned, 
we refer to the observations returned in the case of Afzal Maqsood 
Butt (supra), reproduced hereunder,  
“5……….. In case of failure of purchaser to deposit of the 
sale price in full in terms of the above rules, the sale becomes 
invalid and the Court is under obligation to re-sell the 
property forthwith……”.  
12. 
We hold that giving continuing effect to an invalid / aborted 
sale constitute an illegality, bringing case within the realm of patent 
nullity / voidness. No continuity of sale proceedings was envisaged or 
directed in terms of Rule (84) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908, which 
prescribed option of re-sale, which implied annulment of the process 
of auction sale, upon happening of default under Rule (84) of Order 
XXI of the Code, 1908. Sale in question violates mandate of law, 
which, in the context of the facts and circumstances, is bordering 
fraud, resulting in substantial injury to the appellants.  

EFA No.30/2022  
                        
 
13
13. 
Now we address the last question that whether invalid / void 
sale could be declared as such despite non-compliance of deposit of 
20% under Rule (90) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908. Question raised 
is answered in the case of ‘MUHAMMAD ASHRAF and others (supra), 
relevant paragraph is reproduced hereunder, 
Para 8 “… Without dwelling further on this aspect of the 
matter, we are constrained to observe that there can be no 
escape from the fact that even in the absence of an Objection 
Petition, learned Executing Court is not required to 
automatically confirm an auction mechanically and without 
application of mind by not even, considering the law 
applicable. Such is the law laid down by this Court in the 
case reported as National Bank of Pakistan and 117 others v. 
SAF Textiles Mills Ltd. and another (PLD 2014 SC 283).     
14. 
In the case of Mst. Nadia Malik (supra), it was observed that 
non-compliance of condition of deposit under Rule (90) of Order XXI 
of the Code, 1908 could be condoned in exceptional circumstances, 
which inter alia include violation of mandatory provisions of Order 
XXI of the Code, 1908.  
  
In the case at hand, Rule (84) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908 
was violated by treating an aborted sale as continuing, which illegality 
resulted in extending premium to the decree holder Bank, by way of 
offering the option to purchase, being the third highest bidder, instead 
of going for re-sale, which means conduct of auction proceedings de-
novo. Context of substantial injury and prejudice caused to the 
judgment debtor, in wake of violations qua mandatory provisions of 
Order XXI, in cases when purchaser is an independent third party and 
in case of purchase by the decree holder Bank, have had to be 
appreciated while issuing direction in terms of second proviso to Rule 
(90) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908, depending upon the facts and 

EFA No.30/2022  
                        
 
14
circumstances of the case. Principles laid down in the case of 
Hudaybia Textile Mills Ltd. and others V. Allied Bank of Pakistan Ltd. 
and others (PLD 1987 Supreme Court 512) are not attracted, in the 
context of peculiar facts of this case. In view of the facts narrated, we 
are constrained to hold that failing to interfere, upon being convinced 
that mandate of Rule (84) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908 has been 
violated, would extend premium to the decree holder Bank at the 
expense of causing substantial injury and wrongful loss to the 
appellants. We declare that notwithstanding the failure to deposit 20% 
of the amounts realized, auction sale cannot be confirmed in wake of 
violations committed - ratio settled in the case of ‘MUHAMMAD 
ASHRAF and others’ (supra) is attracted.  
  
The case of Mst. Samrana Nawaz and others (supra) is not 
applicable to the peculiarity of allegations against the sale, which 
decision in fact interprets the scope and effect of second proviso to 
Rule (90) of Order XXI of the Code, 1908, in the context of 
requirement of direction of the Court, for the purposes of imposing the 
condition, extent and nature thereof. Case of Mst. Samrana Nawaz 
and others (supra) does not lay down the principle that a sale, nullity 
in law, carried out in violations of mandatory requirements, still be 
protected if condition of deposit under Rule (90) of Order XXI of the 
Code, 1908 was not met. Ratio settled in the case of ‘Al-Hadi Rice 
Mills (Pvt.) Ltd. through Chief Executive and 4 others’, (supra) is 
reiterated in the context of sales, spilling into the realm of nullity. 

EFA No.30/2022  
                        
 
15
15. 
There is another peculiar feature of the case. Examined in the 
context of gross illegalities committed, we are convinced that no 
apparent prejudice has been caused to the decree holder Bank, which 
had claimed privilege of seeking set-off and was not obligated to 
deposit purchase money.   
16. 
In view of aforesaid, we allow instant appeal, declare the 
auction sale in favour of respondent No.1 a nullity, void and of no 
legal effect including all actions taken pursuant to the auction or 
confirmation thereof. Consequently, order of confirmation of sale 
dated 13.10.2022 is, hereby, set aside. No order as to the costs.
