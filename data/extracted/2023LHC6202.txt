MIRZA VIQAS RAUF, J. This petition as well as 
connected petition (Civil Revision No.216-D of 2017) are arising 
from the judgment and decree dated 23rd January, 2017 passed by the 
learned District Judge, Attock, whereby he proceeded to dismiss the 
appeal of the petitioners of both these petitions as well as respondent 
No.14 and affirm the judgment and decree dated 18th October, 2007 
passed by the learned Civil Judge Class-I, Attock. This judgment 
shall thus govern both these petitions. 
2. 
Facts forming background of these petitions are that 
predecessor-in-interest of respondents No.1A to 1D namely 
Muhammad Hayat (respondent No.1) and respondents No.2 & 3 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-2- 
 
(hereinafter referred to as “respondents”) instituted a suit for separate 
possession seeking partition of properties duly mentioned in the 
headnote of the plaint (hereinafter referred to as “suit properties”) 
with the averments that “suit properties” are joint interse parties. It is 
asserted that the original owner of “suit properties” numbered as 
"
)(ا،
")(ج)،(د was Muhammad Aslam son of Khudadad and he was 
also owner of 1/4th share in the property )ب( forming part of “suit 
properties” and rest 3/4 share in the said property was owned by 
respondent No.9. As per averments of the plaint Muhammad Aslam 
died in the year 1976, who survived respondents No.4 to 6 as 
daughters alongwith respondents No.7, 8 & 14 being widows and 
respondents No.2, 3 & 13 as his sons. It is mentioned that share of 
each son is 7/48 whereas share of each daughter is 7/96 and widow is 
entitled to 1/16 share each. It is also asserted that since the 
“respondents” purchased the land from respondents No.4 to 7 from 
the suit “Hevali” mentioned at serial No.)(ا and thus they became 
owners of 70/96 share whereas respondents No.4 to 7 were left with 
no right of ownership with the “suit properties”. 
3. 
Suit was resisted by the petitioner, who purchased a piece of 
property forming part of “suit properties” from respondent No.13 
during proceedings and thus while submitting his written statement 
he pleaded that he is bonafide purchaser and his rights are protected 
under Section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. Suit was also 
resisted by respondents No.13 & 14, who submitted their written 
statement raising multiple objections. It would not be out of place to 
mention here that respondent No.13 is the petitioner in the connected 
petition. Out of divergent pleadings of the parties multiple issues 
were framed by the trial court, who after recording of evidence from 
both the sides proceeded to pass the preliminary decree vide 
judgment dated 18th October, 2007. Feeling dissatisfied the 
petitioners in both these petitions as well as respondent No.14 
preferred appeal but same was dismissed vide judgment and decree 
dated 23rd January, 2017, which is now impugned in these petitions 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-3- 
 
under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908) 
(hereinafter referred to as “C.P.C.”).  
4. 
Sh. Ahsan-ud-Din, Advocate representing the petitioner 
namely Mubarak Ahmad submitted that his client purchased 03 
Marla property in the constructed shape from respondents No.13 & 
14 through registered sale deed and his rights are protected under 
Section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. It is contended that 
validity of the sale deed in favour of the petitioner has never been 
questioned by the “respondents” in their suit. Learned counsel while 
making reference to the statement of respondent No.2, who appeared 
as PW1 submitted that the “respondents” though did not include all 
the joint properties in their suit but suit was decreed preliminary in 
negation of principle of partial partition. Learned counsel 
emphasized that concurrent findings are the outcome of gross 
misreading and non-reading of evidence. In support of his 
contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on GHULAM RASOOL and 
another versus MUHAMMAD KHALID and 2 others (2006 YLR 2289). 
5. 
Sh. Kamran Shahzad Siddiqui, Advocate representing 
respondents No.13 & 14 and also petitioner in connected petition 
submitted that sufficient evidence was though produced by the 
petitioner that “suit properties” are in respective possession of the 
parties under a family settlement but no heed was paid to this 
material aspect at all. Learned counsel contended that concurrent 
findings are tainted with material irregularities and as such not 
tenable. 
6. 
Conversely, 
Mr. 
Mujeeb-ur-Rehman 
Kiani, 
Advocate 
representing respondents No.1A to 1D submitted that parties are 
admittedly co-owners. He added that no tangible material was 
produced by the petitioner that “suit properties” were partitioned 
under a family settlement and as such suit was rightly decreed. It is 
contended by learned counsel that mere private partition is even 
otherwise not an hurdle in a suit for partition claiming separate 
possession. Learned counsel submitted that the petitioner namely 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-4- 
 
Mubarak Ali purchased the property during the pendency of the suit 
and as such he would only step into the shoes of his vendor and will 
became co-owner. Learned counsel argued that “respondents” 
included all the joint properties interse parties in the suit and it is not 
hit by the principle of partial partition. Placed reliance on 
MUHAMMAD 
YOUSAF 
versus 
ADDITIONAL 
DISTRICT 
JUDGE, 
FEROZEWALA and others (PLD 2023 Lahore 503) and SAKHI MUHAMMAD 
and others versus HAJI AHMED and others (2023 CLC 380). 
7. 
On the other hand, M/s Asim Sohail and Sana Javed, 
Advocates representing respondents No.2 to 12 adopted the 
arguments of learned counsel representing respondents No.1-A to  
1-D. 
8. 
Heard. Record perused. 
9. 
This case has a checkered history at its back. There are four 
properties in toto forming subject matter of the suit. It appears from 
the record that initially suit was dismissed by the learned Civil 
Judge, which judgment was assailed in appeal before the learned 
Additional District Judge, Attock but appeal was dismissed 
whereafter the “respondents” challenged the concurrent findings 
before this Court through Regular Second Appeal No.16 of 1984. 
The appeal was ultimately accepted by way of judgment dated 08th 
March, 2001 and matter was remanded to the trial court for deciding 
it afresh after recording of further evidence of the parties. In post-
remand proceedings both the sides produced their further evidence 
and finally suit was decreed preliminary vide judgment dated 29th 
April, 2002. Feeling dissatisfied, the petitioner preferred an appeal 
before the learned Additional District Judge, who proceeded to 
dismiss the same and thus findings of the courts below were then 
called in question in Civil Revision No.534-D of 2002, which was 
allowed by way of judgment dated 27th February, 2004 and case was 
remanded to the trial court to decide the same afresh in the light of 
issues as originally framed. In the third round, suit was again decreed 
preliminary vide judgment dated 18th October, 2007. The petitioners 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-5- 
 
challenged the said judgment and decree through an appeal before 
the learned Additional District Judge, Attock, who dismissed the 
same. This followed Civil Revision No.383-D of 2008 which was 
allowed by way of judgment dated 20th October, 2016 and case was 
again remitted to the appellate court with the direction to decide the 
appeal afresh as in the earlier judgment the learned Additional 
District Judge had posted the issues of some other case whereas 
findings were given with regard to the case in hand. After remand 
the appeal was heard by the learned District Judge, Attock, who 
proceeded to dismiss the same through impugned judgment and 
decree dated 23rd January, 2017. 
10. 
It is apparent from the record that suit is mainly resisted by the 
petitioner firstly on the ground that the “suit properties” were 
partitioned under a family settlement by the original owners in his 
lifetime and as such these have lost the status of joint properties and 
secondly the “respondents” did not include all the properties of 
Muhammad Aslam, predecessor-in-interest of respondents No.2 to 8, 
13 & 14 in the suit which renders the same not proceedable. Though 
from the pleadings of the parties multiple issues were framed but in 
order to circumscribe the matter in controversy in more precise and 
specific shape, to my mind following points for determination 
emerge before this Court :- 
(i). 
Whether the “suit properties” are joint interse parties or 
same have been partitioned under a family settlement? 
(ii). 
Had there been any family settlement what would be its 
effect?  
(iii). 
Whether suit is hit by principle of partial partition? and 
(iv). 
What would be the status of sale transaction effected in 
favour of petitioner namely Mubarak Ahmad during 
the pendency of the suit?  
11. 
Adverting to the moot points, it is observed that point at serial 
Nos.(i) & (ii) are not only interlinked but dependent upon each other. 
It is evident from the record that the “respondents” at the very outset 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-6- 
 
while instituting suit asserted that the “suit properties” are joint in 
nature and not yet partitioned by meets and bounds. Contrary to this 
suit was resisted by the petitioners/defendants on the ground that 
there is a family partition interse parties by virtue of which all the 
co-owners are in possession as per their legal shares. To this effect 
claim of the petitioners rests upon the stance taken by respondents 
No.13 & 14 in their written statement. The relevant extract is 
reproduced below :- 
 
 
12. 
It is an admitted fact that the “suit properties” were originally 
owned by Muhammad Aslam son of Khudadad, who contracted 
three marriages and respondents No.2 to 6 & 13 are his off springs 
whereas respondent No.14 Mst. Karam Jan is one of his widows. In 
order to prove that the “suit properties” are joint interse parties, the 
“respondents” produced Khizar Hayat as PW1, who reiterated the 
contents of the plaint. Muhammad Iqbal was produced as PW2. He 
too deposed on the same lines. From the perusal of the revenue 
record produced by the “respondents” it clearly evinces that the 
status of the “suit properties” is recorded as joint. Moreover Mst. 
Karam Jan i.e. respondent No.14 when appeared in the witness box 
she stated as under :- 
 
It is thus crystal clear that no partition has ever taken place through 
any written deed. 
13. 
Chapter XI of the Land Revenue Act, 1967 (hereinafter 
referred to as “Act, 1967”) deals with the partition of the joint land. 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-7- 
 
Section 147 of the Act ibid provides a mechanism for affirmation of 
partitions privately effected which is reproduced below for ready 
reference and convenience :- 
“147.    Affirmation of partition privately effected.– (1) In 
any case in which a partition has been made without the 
intervention of a Revenue Officer, any party thereto may apply 
to a Revenue Officer for an order affirming the partition. 
      (2)  On receiving the application, the Revenue Officer shall 
enquire into the case, and if he finds that the partition has in fact 
been made, he may make an order affirming it and proceed under 
sections 143, 144, 145 and 146, or any of those sections, as 
circumstances may require, in the same manner as if the partition 
had been made on an application to himself under this Chapter.” 
The above provision clearly manifests that if a party pleads some 
private partition effected under some family settlement with regard 
to partition of joint land, he has to apply to the revenue officer 
obtaining an order for affirmation of such partition. In other words 
in absence of any order of affirmation in terms of Section 147 of the 
“Act, 1967” party relying upon private partition would be precluded 
to claim any right thereunder.  
14. 
It would not be out of context to mention here that Chapter 18 
of the Land Record Manual provides a procedure in partition cases 
and clause 18.1 especially deals with private partitions. Guidance in 
this respect can be sought from MUHAMMAD MUKHTAR and others 
versus MUHAMMAD SHARIF and others (2007 SCMR 1867). Reference in 
this regard can also be made to Mst. WALAYAT BEGUM and 3 others 
versus MUHAMMAD AFSAR and 3 others (2014 CLC 1103). The relevant 
extract from the same is reproduced below :- 
“6……... It is an admitted fact that Bostan (the predecessor of 
the 
present 
appellants) 
and 
the 
respondent/defendant 
Muhammad Afsar along with others are co-sharers in the 
khewat of the disputed land. The respondent/defendant filed an 
application for partition before the Revenue Assistant and ex 
parte proceedings were ordered against the respondent in the 
partition proceedings. Partition deed Exh.D.N. was issued and 
ultimately a warrant of possession was issued in the name of 
respondent/ defendant Muhammad Afsar to the extent of the 
land measuring 2 Kanals and 1 Marla. The said Muhammad 
Afsar was declared owner in possession of the said land. It is a 
settled principle of law that private partition or family 
settlement cannot be declared as final partition. Any of the co-
sharers can approach the proper forum for partition of the 
jointly owned land in accordance with the provisions of law. 
The record reveals that the predecessor of the present 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-8- 
 
appellants Bostan refused service of the notice in the partition 
proceedings and thereafter ex parte proceedings were ordered 
against him. It was not proved that the service was conducted 
fictitiously. It was not stated by the said Bostan that what loss 
was occurred due to partition proceedings? If at all, any 
fluctuation/ decrease or increase in the quantity of the land is 
found, the only proper forum for redressal regarding the same 
is the revenue court designated for the purpose. Moreover, it 
has not been brought on record and even has not been proved 
that how much deficiency in the quantity of the land has found 
in the shares of the said Bostan? It is an admitted principle of 
law as well that the official partition is always preferred to the 
private partition. No co-sharer can be deprived of his right only 
due to this fact that the other co-sharer is in possession of any 
land. 
7. 
It was not proved by the present appellants that when 
they got knowledge regarding the partition proceedings. The 
record also reveals that the said Bostan filed a suit for 
permanent injunction on 22-8-2000 after issuance of warrant of 
possession in favour of the respondent/ defendant Muhammad 
Afsar. The said suit was dismissed for non-prosecution on 9-3-
2002. This fact indicates that the said Bostan had knowledge of 
the partition process and he remained absent from the partition 
proceedings intentionally and he filed the suit for permanent 
injunction when the warrant of possession was issued in the 
name of the respondent Muhammad Afsar. So, the suit under 
appeal was filed beyond the period of limitation. The present 
appellants have relied on private partition only. The private 
partition does not change the nature of the joint property and 
the same will remain joint until and unless it is partitioned by 
the revenue authorities according to the provisions of law. It is 
a settled principle of law as well that no suit for possession can 
be filed by a co-sharer having the version that he is already in 
possession of a part of the disputed land and such suit cannot 
be treated under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act.” 
15. 
In the case of SAKHI MUHAMMAD and others versus HAJI AHMED 
and others (2023 CLC 380), while dealing with similar question this 
Court held as under :- 
“7. 
Section 147 of the "Act, 1967", provides a 
mechanism for affirmation of partitions privately effected, 
which reads as under:- 
147. Affirmation of partitions privately effected. (1) In 
any case in which a partition has been made without 
the intervention of a Revenue Officer, any party thereto 
may apply to a Revenue Officer for an order affirming 
the partition. 
(2) On receiving the application, the Revenue Officer 
shall enquire into the case, and if he finds that the 
partition has in fact been made, he may make an order 
affirming it and proceed under sections 143, 144, 145 
and 146, or any of those sections, as circumstances may 
require, in the same manner as if the partition had been 
made on an application to himself under this Chapter." 
From the bare perusal of above referred provision of law, it 
clearly evinces that if a party is relying upon some family 
settlement with regard to partition of joint land, any party 
interested therein has to apply to the Revenue Officer for 
obtaining an order for affirmation of such partition. In 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-9- 
 
absence of any such order, party relying upon the private 
partition would be precluded to claim any right therefrom. 
Furthermore, Chapter 18 of the Land Record Manual 
provides a procedure in partition cases and clause 18.1 
especially deals with private partitions. To understand the 
true import of private partition, guidance can be sought from 
Muhammad Mukhtar and others v. Muhammad Sharif and 
others (2007 SCMR 1867). Reference in this regard can also 
be made to Mst. Walayat Begum and 3 others v. Muhammad 
Afsar and 3 others (2014 CLC 1103).” 
From the above analysis it can safely be held that no family 
settlement has ever taken place and the “suit properties” are still 
joint interse parties. 
16. 
Next comes the question relating to partial partition, it appears 
from the record that to this effect respondents No.13 & 14, out of 
them former is also petitioner in the connected petition, while 
submitting their written statement objected the maintainability of the 
suit on the ground that “respondents” did not include the whole 
properties owned by Muhammad Aslam in the suit. To this effect 
learned counsel for the petitioner has heavily relied upon the 
statement of Khizar Hayat Khan (PW1).  Attending this question it 
is noted that from the bare perusal of plaint, it appears that the 
“respondents sought partition of three “Hevalies” one of which is 
situated in the revenue limits of Baryar whereas other two falls 
within the limits of revenue estate of Nawa, fourth and last property 
is in the shape of drawing room “بیٹھک” which too falls within the 
territorial limits of revenue estate of Nawa. The objection of partial 
partition was taken by respondents No.13 & 14 without mentioning 
as to which property or properties have not been included in the suit. 
For the purpose of reference, relevant extract from the written 
statement is reproduced below :- 
 
The above was clearly a vague assertion and even during evidence 
no specific property was pointed out either by the petitioner or 
respondents No.13 & 14. So far statement of Khizar Hayat (PW1) is 
concerned, on the basis of which learned counsel has made emphasis 
that the suit is hit by partial partition, it would be relevant to have a 
glimpse of the said part of statement, which reads as under :- 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-10- 
 
 
 
From the above portion of statement, it is crystal clear that the 
“Hevali” Dhok Fateh Wali is located in the revenue estate of Nawa. 
The petitioner has failed to bring on record any material to 
substantiate that “Heavli” Dhok Fateh Wali is an independent and 
separate property thus one cannot say that the suit is not proceedable 
being hit by principle of partial partition. So far judgment in the case 
of Ghulam Rasool’s supra is concerned, it is observed that same is 
not applicable to the case in hand, as it was founded on entirely 
different facts and circumstances.  
17. 
Coming to the last point of controversy relating to sale 
transaction effected in favour of the petitioner, it is observed that 
undoubtedly said transaction took place during the pendency of the 
suit. The transaction thus would be governed in terms of Section 52 
of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 on the touchstone of principle 
of lis pendens. There is no cavil to the proposition that a co-sharer 
has every right to transfer or sell the joint property to a third person 
but such transfer or alienation is always dependent upon the actual 
share of such co-owner and if he transfers or alienates the property 
within his share, the vendee will step into his shoes accordingly. Law 
to this effect is well settled that no co-sharer can sell joint property 
with specific boundaries if any such transaction is made that would 
always be the subject to the partition. Guidance in this respect can be 
sought from Mst. TABASSUM SHAHEEN versus Mst. UZMA RAHAT and 
others (2012 SCMR 983) wherein the Supreme Court of Pakistan held 
as under :- 
“5. 
The afore-referred provision enshrines the age old 
and well established principle of equity that ut lite pendente 
nihil innovetur (pending litigation nothing new should be 
introduced) and stipulates that pendente lite parties to 
litigation wherein right to immovable property is in 
question, no party can alienate or otherwise deal with such 
property to the detriment of his opponent. Any transfer so 
made would be hit by this Section. The doctrine by now is 
recognized both in law and equity and underpins the 
rationale that no action or suit would succeed if alienations 
made during pendency of proceedings in the said suit or 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-11- 
 
action were allowed to prevail. The effect of such alienation 
would be that the plaintiff would be defeated by defendants 
alienating the suit property before the judgment or decree 
and the former would be obliged to initiate de novo 
proceedings and that too with lurking fear that he could 
again be defeated by the same trick. The doctrine of lis 
pendens in pith and substance is not only based on equity but 
also at good conscience and justice. In Lalji Singh v. 
Rameshuwar Misra ((1983) 9 All LR 269 (271) (All)), the 
essential ingredients of section 52 ibid or the conditions 
precedent to attract this principle were construed as follow:-- 
(i) 
the pendency of any suit or proceeding in a court law: 
(ii) 
the court must have jurisdiction over the person or 
property; 
(iii) 
the property must have specifically described and 
should be affected by the termination of the suit or 
proceedings; 
(iv) 
the right to the said property be directly and 
specifically be in question in any suit or proceeding; 
(v) 
an alienation of such immovable property without the 
permission or order of the court; and 
(vi) 
the  alienation  should  be  during  the  pendency  of  
any  such suit or proceeding and a suit or proceeding 
in question is not collusive. 
6. 
From our jurisdiction in recent past, the ambit and 
import of lis pendense came up for consideration before a 
Full Bench of this Court in Muhammad Ashraf Butt v. 
Muhammad Asif Bhatti (PLD 2011 SC 905) and at page 912, 
one of us (Mian Saqib Nisar, J) speaking for the Court 
observed as follows:-- 
"The rule unambiguously prescribes that the rights of the 
party to the suit, who ultimately succeed in the matter 
are not affected in any manner whatsoever on account of 
the alienation, and the transferee of the property shall 
acquire the title to the property subject to the final 
outcome of the lis. Thus, the transferee of the suit 
property, even the purchaser for value; without notice of 
the pendency of suit, who in the ordinary judicial 
parlance is known as a bona fide purchasers in view of 
the rule/doctrine of lis pendens shall be bound by the 
result of the suit stricto sensu in all respects, as his 
transferor would be bound. The transferee therefore does 
not acquire any legal title free from the clog of his 
unsuccessful transferor, in whose shoes he steps in for 
all intents and purposes and has to swim and sink with 
his predecessor in interest ............................................... 
............................................................................... 
........................................... 
The 
foundation 
of 
the 
doctrine is not rested upon notice, actual or constructive, 
it only rest on necessity and expediency, that is, the 
necessity of final adjudication (Emphasis supplied) that 
neither party to the litigation should alienate the 
property so as to effect the rights of his opponent. If that 
was not so, there would be no end to litigation and the 
justice would be defeated. In support of the above, 
reliance is placed upon Messrs Aman Enterprises v. 
Messrs Rahim Industries Ltd. and another (PLD 1993 SC 
292), Muhammad Nawaz Khan v. Muhammad Khan and 
2 others (2002 SCMR 2003). Besides, in West Virginia 
Pulp and Paper Co. v. Cooper, 106 S.E. 55, 60, 87 W.Va. 
781, it has been held the doctrine of "lis pendens" is that 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-12- 
 
one who purchases from a party pending suit a part or 
the whole of the subject-matter involved in the litigation 
takes it subject to the final disposition of the cause and is 
bound by the decision that may be entered against the 
party from whom he derived title. 
In Tilton v. Cofield, 93 U. S. 168, 23 L.Ed, 858, the view 
set out is "the doctrine of lis pendens is that real 
property, when it has been put in litigation by a suit in 
equity, in which it is specifically described, will, if the 
suit is prosecuted with vigilance, be bound by the final 
decree, notwithstanding any intermediate  alienation; 
and one who intermeddles with property in litigation 
does so at his peril and is as conclusively bound by the 
results of the litigation, whatever they may be, as if he 
had been a party from the outset". 
Reliance in this respect can also be placed on MUHAMMAD ASHRAF 
BUTT and others versus MUHAMMAD ASIF BHATTI and others (PLD 2011 
Supreme Court 905) and KHADIM HUSSAIN versus ABID HUSSAIN and 
others (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 419).  
18. 
Since the petitioner has purchased 10 Marla from respondent 
No.14 which is within his legal share, so sale deed to the extent of 
such transfer would remain intact but the petitioner cannot claim 
exclusive possession on the basis of schedule of boundaries 
mentioned therein. He would be treated as co-owner/co-sharer and 
would be entitled to get the property according to his entitlement in 
the process of partition in terms of preliminary decree passed by the 
trial court. Reference to this effect can be made to Mst. KALSOOM 
MALIK and others versus ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER and others (1996 
SCMR 710) and MUHAMMAD SHARIF and 3 others versus GHULAM 
HUSSAIN and another (1995 SCMR 514).  
19. 
In the case of MUHAMMAD MUNAWAR BAJWA versus Mst. 
ZUBERA SHAHEEN and another (2004 CLC 441) this Court while 
reiterating the above principles held as under :- 
“17……….While dealing with a similar question, in Syed 
Jamal Shah v. Abdul Qadir Shah and others PLD 1955 Pesh. 
26, it was observed at page 30 of the Report as follows:-- 
"I consequently hold that a person, who is in exclusive 
possession of a certain portion of a joint property, can 
alienate that property, but then the alienation will be subject 
to any adjustment which takes place at the time of the 
partition of the joint property, and the person, to whom that 
joint property is allotted, shall take that property free of 
such alienation." 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-13- 
 
In Muhammad Muzaffar Khan v. Muhammad Yusuf Khan 
PLD 1959 SC 9 the Honourable Supreme Court had declared 
the law thus:-- 
"The vendee of a co-sharer who owns an undivided Khata 
in common with another, is clothed with the same rights as 
the vendor has in the property no more and no less. If the 
vendor was in exclusive possession of a certain portion of 
the joint land and transfers its possession to his vendee, so 
long as there is no partition between the co-sharers, the 
vendee must be regarded as stepping into the shoes of his 
transferor qua his ownership rights in the joint property, to 
the extent of the area purchased by him, provided that the 
area in question does not exceed the share which the 
transferor owns in the whole property. Alienation of 
specific plots transferred to the vendee would only entitle 
the latter to retain possession of them till such time as an 
actual partition by metes and bounds takes place between 
the co-sharers". 
A similar question came up for consideration before the 
Supreme Court of Azad Jammu & Kashmir in the case reported 
as Mustafa Khan and 3 others v. Muhammad Khan and another 
PLD 1978 SC (AJ&K) 75. The case-law was extensively 
reviewed at pages 77-79 of the Report, and it was observed as 
follows:-- 
"After careful examination of the law on the point and the 
facts of this case, we are of the view that a co-sharer in 
possession of specific field numbers can validly transfer 
such land, even if his share in such specific field numbers 
exceeds his share, provided it does not exceed his over all 
entitlement of the share in the whole land. Of course the 
vendees' rights will be subject to adjustment on partition. 
But such a sale cannot be legally challenged on the mere 
ground that the land sold exceeds the share of the vendor in 
the specific numbers. 
For this we may refer to AIR 1925 Lah. 518. In that case 
Mr. Justice Martineau, was confronted with the question 
whether a co-sharer in a Shamilat land on a transfer made 
by another co-sharer of land under his sole and exclusive 
possession, can prevent transferee from construction of 
building on such land. The learned Judge after discussing 
all aspect of the case answered the proposition in 
affirmative and stated that-- 
"Although Allahdiya and Kimun not being the sole owners 
of the land could not sell the full proprietary rights, the sale 
by them nevertheless holds good to the extent of conveying 
the rights which they could sell including the right to retain 
possession till partition. It has been held in Muhammad 
Amin v. Karam Das, (1924 Lah. 293) in which various 
rulings, on the point have been considered, that when a 
co-sharer has been long in possession of a portion of the 
Shamilat land no other co-sharer can oust him therefrom or 
even get joint possession with him as long as a partition of 
the Shamilat does not take place. The plaintiff has the same 
rights in the land that his predecessor in title had. He is 
entitled to undisturbed possession of the land as long as the 
Shamilat is not partitioned, and the defendants have no 
right to prevent him from building on the land". 
A similar point came up for decision before Lahore High Court 
in AIR 1938 Lah. 465. In that case, the point to be determined 
was whether, in a case of joint "Khata" where one co-sharer 
had been in exclusive possession for a long time of a portion of 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-14- 
 
the joint land not exceeding his share in the entire holding, 
another co-sharer can dispossess him against his will from such 
land. Mr. Justice Tek Chand, relying on AIR 1924 Lah. 293 
and AIR 1925 Lah. 518 observed:- 
"It is well-settled that in a case of joint Khata, where one 
co-sharer has been in exclusive possession of a portion of 
the joint land, which does not exceed his share in the entire 
holding, another co-sharer cannot dispossess him against 
his will from the portion of which he had been in 
possession".  
Again an identical question came for consideration before the 
Oudh High Court in AIR 1939 Oudh 243. In that case Plot 
No.2807 was jointly owned by Baldeo Singh and Ambika 
Prasad, along with 80 other defendants. They (Baldeo Singh 
and Ambika Prasad) had given two leases in respect of this plot 
one on 11th of October, 1932 and the other on the 15th of 
November, 1932 in favour of defendant No. 1. The leases were 
made subject of a regular suit. But it was held that Baldeo 
Singh and Ambika Prasad being in exclusive possession of the 
land at the time of the lease were competent to lease it out to 
defendant No.1 alongwith possession. Mr. Justice Radha 
Krishna, held that:-- 
"The question, therefore, is whether a co-sharer, who has 
been in exclusive possession of a certain plot of land 
without let or hindrance by other co-sharers, can transfer 
the plot to a third person subject to the right of other 
co-sharers to obtain a partition of the village. The law on 
the point in Oudh seems to me to be well-settled. In 21 OC 
214 Lindsay, .J.C. (later Lindsay, J.) held that the general 
rule regarding the enjoyment of joint property by the 
co-sharers is that one co-sharer has no right to appropriate 
specific portions of such property to the exclusion of his 
co-sharers except by means of a lawful partition. This rule, 
however, is subject to the qualification that where one 
co-sharer has been for a long time in peaceful possession of 
a portion of the joint property without hindrance or 
opposition by his co-owners the latter are not entitled to 
eject him except by means of a partition". 
In the case AIR 1927 Oudh 467 and AIR 1921 Oudh 106 were 
relied upon:-- 
"The question of entitlement of a co-sharer to transfer the 
specific land under his possession was once again 
adjudicated in a Division Bench case in AIR 1940 Lah. 
473. The Bench consisted of Mr. Justice Tek Chand and 
Mr. Justice Bhide Judges. The learned Judge Bhide who 
wrote the principal judgment in the case, after discussing 
the case-law on the point, observed:- 
"As a result, it has been held that a co-sharer who is in such 
possession of any portion of a joint Khata, can transfer that 
portion subject to adjustment of the rights of the other 
co-sharers therein at the time of partition. This view seems 
to be consistent with the principle embodied in section 44, 
T.P. Act, regarding transfers of their `interests' in joint 
property by co-sharers'. 
In PLD 1955 Pesh. 26, a similar question was posed to be 
determined. It was held by Mr. Justice Muhammad Shafi, 
that:-- 
"A person, who is in exclusive possession of a certain 
portion of a joint property, can alienate that property, but 
then the alienation will be subject to any adjustment which 
takes place at the time of the partition of the joint property, 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-15- 
 
and the person, to whom that joint property is allotted, shall 
take that property free of such alienation". 
In PLD 1959 S.C. (Pak.) 9 (Full Court case), it was observed 
by Mr. Justice S.A. Rahman, who wrote the main judgment 
that:-- 
"Alienation of specific plot transferred to the vendee would 
only entitle the, latter to retain possession of them till such 
time as an actual partition by metes and bounds takes place 
between the co-sharers." 
Looked from another angle we come to the same conclusion. It 
is conclusively established that the possession of the vendor in 
the specific field numbers was due to family arrangement. It is 
true that such an arrangement does not extinguish the title of 
other co-sharers, but so far as the factum of such a possession 
and sale of the specific field numbers is concerned, it certainly 
debars other co-sharers to get back such possession or 
challenge the sale. This is, of course, subject to adjustment at 
the time of partition as would have been the case if the vendor 
had not sold the land. Section 115 of the Evidence Act comes 
to the aid of vendee in such a case. Mr. Justice Monir, formerly 
Chief Justice of Pakistan in his Principles and Digest of the 
Law of Evidence, Vol. II, Pakistan Edition, page 1296 says:-- 
"Family arrangements are arrangements between the 
members of a family for the preservation of its piece of 
property. The principles upon which such arrangements are 
enforced in England are stated in the case of Williams v. 
Williams. Such arrangements are constantly entered into in 
this country, and, where they have been acted upon and 
acquiesced, the Court will not look so much to the 
adequacy of the consideration as to the motives and 
conduct of the parties. In a settlement of a doubtful right 
truth may be on either side, but the essential effect of the 
settlement is that further trouble or investigation is put to an 
end and a settlement is concluded to restore harmony. The 
consideration for such a settlement is the mutual promise 
made, or forbearance shown, by one party to the other. In 
the absence of fraud or undue influence, it is not, therefore, 
open to either party to resile from it afterwards and the 
settlement is binding not only on the parties but on their 
sons and descendants. A family settlement is binding, even 
though a limited owner is a party to it. Where parties settle 
a family dispute amicably, take a share of the property, 
enter into possession, and subsequently sell or mortgage the 
items allotted to them, they are estopped from questioning 
the settlement". 
AIR 1924 All. 63 may be referred as an authority on point. 
In that case a person deliberately by his own conduct got 
the name of another person who had no right to inheritance 
to a property entered as owner of such property at the time 
of mutation. Later on he challenged the mutation. It was 
held by the Division Bench of the Court that he was 
estopped from subsequently pleading that he was the owner 
of the whole property". 
In view of this we hold that the appellants' suit is otherwise 
too hit by the doctrine of estoppel as because of the family 
arrangement they are precluded from claiming their shares 
in the specific field numbers in possession of the vendor". 
18. The afore-quoted decision of the Supreme Court of Azad 
Jammu and Kashmir was cited, with approval, by the Hon'ble 
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Shah Hussain v. Abdul Qayyum 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-16- 
 
and others 1984 SCMR 427 wherein it was further held as 
follows:-- 
"We have examined the contentions raised by the learned 
counsel and agree with the finding of the learned High 
Court Judge in principle i.e. the sale of specific field 
numbers 
by 
a 
co-sharer 
in 
possession 
can, 
for 
consideration, alienate the land in possession, and if his 
share in such specific field numbers exceeds his share, 
provided it does not exceed his over all entitlement in the 
land, the vendee's rights would be subject to adjustment on 
partition as held in the case cited by the learned Judge 
entitled Mustafa Khan and 3 others v. Muhammad Khan 
and another PLD 1978 S.C. (AJK) 75". 
In Ch. Ghulam Abbas v. Barkat Ali add another 1999 YLR 
2190, a learned Judge of this Court held in the following 
terms:-- 
"Law is well-settled that a co-sharer, in exclusive 
possession of specific field number can alienate the entire 
field number provided the area of the said field number 
does not exceed the entitlement of the vendor in the entire 
joint holdings. The effect of this sale is that the vendee 
steps into the shoes of the vendor and can retain possession 
subject to adjustment at the time of partition". 
Respectfully 
following 
the 
law 
laid 
down 
in 
the 
aforementioned decisions, I would hold that the sale in favour 
of defendant-respondent No. 1 is not open to exception either 
on fact or in law, and she can retain possession of the suit-land 
till such time as an actual partition by metes and bounds takes 
place between the co-owners. The concurrent findings of facts 
recorded by the Courts below under Issues 1 and 2, being 
neither perverse or whimsical nor arbitrarily, do not call for 
interference.” 
20. 
There are concurrent findings of facts recorded by both the 
courts below, which are apparently rested upon sound reasoning. The 
petitioner has failed to point out any misreading and non-reading of 
evidence. The revisional jurisdiction is not meant to unearth another 
possible view from the evidence which is contra to the findings 
rendered by two courts of competent jurisdiction. The revisional 
jurisdiction is to be exercised, while keeping in view the principles 
enshrined in Section 115 of “C.P.C.”. The superior courts are always 
reluctant to interfere with the concurrent findings, unless some patent 
illegality or material irregularity crept up on the record or pointed 
out by the petitioner(s). The exercise of revisional powers is always 
guided by the necessary pre-conditions laid down in the above 
referred provision of law. The scanning of evidence and the perusal 
of impugned judgments does not reflect any illegality or material 
irregularity, justifying interference by this Court. Reference in this 
respect can be made to GHULAM QADIR and others versus Sh. ABDUL 

Civil Revision No.341-D of 2017 
-17- 
 
WADOOD and others (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 712), Mst. ZARSHEDA 
versus NOBAT KHAN (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 21) and MUHAMMAD 
SARWAR and others versus HASHMAL KHAN and others (PLD 2022 Supreme 
Court 13). 
21. 
For the foregoing reasons, both civil revisions, having no 
merits are dismissed with no order as to costs.
