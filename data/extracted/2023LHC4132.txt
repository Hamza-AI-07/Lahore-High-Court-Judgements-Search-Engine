C.M. No.01 of 2005

Main Case 
2. 
Through instant appeal, appellant has assailed vires of 
order dated 06.05.2003, passed by respondent No.1, whereby 
appellant’s representation for expunction of remarks recorded in 
his Annual Confidential Report (“ACR”) for the period from 
01.01.2001 to 30.04.2001 was declined.  
3.  
Brief facts of the case are that vide letter dated 
24.02.2003,  appellant was communicated remarks recorded by 
the then District & Sessions Judge, Gujrat, in his ACR 
regarding period from 01.01.2001 to 30.04.2001.  Appellant 

 
Service Appeal No.10 of 2003

filed representation but the same was declined vide impugned 
order dated 06.05.2003. Hence, instant appeal. 
4. 
Learned counsel for appellant submits that the comments 
“his integrity was not above board” and “reported to be 
corrupt” in its nature and essence, are not only a stigma on 
future career of appellant but also constitutes adverse remarks. 
Adds that these remarks, even otherwise, are vague and without 
reference to any particular instance justifying formulation of the 
opinion, thus, same are liable to be expunged. He contends that 
in the ACR, he is held to be average officer which cannot be 
treated as adverse remarks as per the well settled principle of 
law. He has placed reliance upon Malik Azhar-ul-Haq v. 
Registrar, Lahore High Court, Lahore [2012 PLC (C.S.) 1208].  
5. 
On the contrary, learned Legal Advisor of respondent 
No.1 submits that adverse remarks were also recorded in the 
ACRs of the appellant for the period i.e. 01.1.2000 to 
05.9.2000, 04.8.1997 to 31.12.1997 and 22.2.1995 to 
23.10.1995 wherein the integrity of the appellant was recorded 
not being above board and not enjoying good reputation. Adds 
that officer was duly warned by the Reporting Officer to 
improve his work and conduct as he decided 5 cases instead of 
24 as per Standing Instructions but no improvement was found 
in work and conduct of the appellant, hence, instant appeal is 
liable to be dismissed. 
6. 
Arguments heard. Available record perused.  
7. 
Appellant is aggrieved of the remarks appearing in his 
ACR for the period from 01.01.2001 to 30.04.2001, which 
according to him being “adverse remarks” are problematic for 
grant of service benefits whereas stance of respondent No.1 is 
that the appellant has history of adverse remarks in his ACRs. 
For ease of reference, the remarks in question are reproduced as 
under:-

PART-VII 
 
 
 
a). 
REMARKS OF THE COUNTERSIGNING OFFICER 
 
 
 
 
 
No reason to differ with the opinion of the reporting officer. 
 
It is evidently clear that the above observations are 
“adverse remarks” and we are unable to find any material from 
the record to satisfiy us that the remarks are supported by 
evidence. It is admitted position that no complaint of 
corruption, in writing had been received against the appellant. 
Describing a person as reported to be corrupt is a very serious 
allegation which can spoil his whole career as a civil servant. 
Therefore, while examining ACRs, where a person is dubbed as 
corrupt we have to see as to whether there was any cogent 
material or justification for recording the remarks. It is true that 
ordinarily, in recording remarks or opinions, full reasons need 
not be given but the conclusions have to be based on facts and 
when in contest, as in this case the concerned officer should 
have plausible explanation to justify his conclusions. In the case 
in hand, needful  was not done.  The Reporting Officer must not 
be evasive in his remarks and avoid exaggerations. He should 
also state with distinctiveness whether any of the defects 
reported have already been brought to the notice of the officer 
concerned and also whether he has or has not taken steps to 

 
Service Appeal No.10 of 2003

remedy them. Reliance is placed on Muhammad Ashraf 
Shagufta, Additional District and Sessions Judge, Sialkot v. 
Lahore High Court through Registrar and another (1995 
PLC(C.S.) 1165), Moor Elahi v. Director of Civilian 
Personnel, Rear Air Headquarters, Peshawar and 2 others 
(1997 SCMR 1749) and Malik Azhar-ul-Haq v. Registrar, 
Lahore High Court, Lahore (2012 PLC (C.S.) 1208). 
8. 
Record shows that in the ACR for the period in question, 
overall performance of the appellant was average which as per 
well settled principles of law cannot be treated as adverse 
remarks unless same are treated so and duly communicated to 
appellant. This was not so in instant case as letter dated 
08.1.2003 regarding communication of remarks is not showing 
average as adverse remarks. Refence can be made to Pakistan 
Broadcasting Corporation through D.G. H.Q., Islamabad and 
another v. Nasiruddin (1997 SCMR 1303), Muhammad Afzal 
Javed, Additional District and Sessions Judge, Lahore v. 
Lahore High Court, Lahore through Registrar, Lahore High 
Court, Lahore and 2 others (2003 PLC(C.S.) 1046) and Shakti 
Ram Rathore v. Federation of Pakistan and others (2009 
SCMR 259). The contention of learned counsel for respondent 
that appellant could not achieve requisite number of contested 
cases does not support the adverse entries regarding work of 
appellant as overall grading/performance has been shown as 
average. 
9. 
Needless to say that an officer is to be informed if his 
Reporting Officer or Countersigning Officer is not satisfied 
with his work and the communication of such dissatisfaction 
with advice or warning should be prompt so that the officer may 
exterminate the fault and improve his performance. The 
Reproting Officer should not record adverse remarks of a civil 
servant unless proper cousnelling or advice of his performance 
is communicated. The civil servant must be apprised his weak 
points and advised to improve and then adverse remarks should 

 
Service Appeal No.10 of 2003 
5
be recorded if the concerned civil servant failed to improve 
despite counseling. As the purpose of counseling is to improve 
the performance of the officer and not to insult him and the 
advice given orally or in written form would be beneficial for 
the officer improving his performance. The guidance and advice 
to subordinate officer can ultimately benefit the organization. 
Reliance is placed on Director General, Intelligence Bureau v. 
Riaz-ul-Wahab and others (2023 SCMR 877). 
10. 
Resultantly, this appeal is allowed and impugned order is 
set aside. Consequently, impugned remarks stand expunged.
