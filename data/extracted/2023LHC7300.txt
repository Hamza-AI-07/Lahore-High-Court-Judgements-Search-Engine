Ikram, against the petitioner with the allegation that the petitioner had 
attempted to rape Aliza Rashid (respondent No.7), the daughter of the 
complainant of the case. During the investigation of the case, the 
statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. of Aliza Rashid (respondent 
No.7), was recorded on 11.09.2023 and subsequent to the recording of 
the said statement of Aliza Rashid (respondent No.7), the learned 
counsel for the petitioner moved an application before the learned 
Magistrate, Mianchannu for being allowed to cross examine Aliza 
Rashid (respondent No.7), however, the said application was rejected 
by the learned Magistrate, Mianchannu, vide order dated 17.10.2023. 
The petitioner assailed the order dated 17.10.2023 passed by the 
learned Magistrate, Mianchannu by way of filing a criminal revision 
petition, however, the said criminal revision petition was also 
dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Mianchannu, 
vide order dated 25.10.2023, hence, this petition. 
3.      The learned counsel for the petitioner, inter alia, contended that 
according to section 14(2) of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) 
Act, 2021, an opportunity to cross examine the victim, whose 
statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. is being recorded, by the counsel 
for the accused, has been made mandatory however, that right was not 
extended to the learned counsel for the petitioner and therefore, the 
order dated 17.10.2023 passed by the learned Magistrate and the order 
dated 25.10.2023 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, are 
liable to be set-aside.

4.           On the other hand, the learned Assistant Advocate General

Additional Sessions Judge, did not suffer from any illegality and 
needed no interference being passed in accordance with the law. 
5.           I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the 
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents No.6 and 7, 
the learned Assistant Advocate General and perused the documents 
appended with this petition as well as the order dated 17.10.2023 
passed by the learned Magistrate and the order dated 25.10.2023 
passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge. 
5.             A perusal of the record reveals that case F.I.R No.530 of 
2023 was registered at Police Station Saddar Mianchannu, District 
Khanewal, on the information of Rashid Ikram, against the petitioner 
with the allegation that the petitioner had attempted to rape Aliza 
Rashid (respondent No.7), the daughter of the complainant of the 
case. During the investigation of the case, the statement under section 
164 Cr.P.C. of Aliza Rashid (respondent No.7), was recorded on 
11.09.2023 and subsequent to the recording of the said statement of 
Aliza Rashid (respondent No.7), the learned counsel for the petitioner 
moved an application before the learned Magistrate, Mianchannu for 
being allowed to cross examine Aliza Rashid (respondent No.7), 
however, the said application was rejected by the learned Magistrate,

Writ Petition No.16927 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
Mianchannu, vide order dated 17.10.2023. The petitioner assailed the 
order dated 17.10.2023 passed by the learned Magistrate, Mianchannu 
by way of filing a criminal revision petition, however, the said 
criminal revision petition was also dismissed by the learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Mianchannu, vide order dated 25.10.2023. 
With regard to the prayer of the petitioner for allowing his learned 
counsel to cross examine Aliza Rashid (respondent No.7), the victim 
of the case, it has been observed that the provisions of section 14(2) of 
the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021, are very much clear 
in their meaning. As per section 14(2) of the Anti-Rape (Investigation 
and Trial) Act, 2021, it has been made mandatory that an opportunity 
to cross examine the victim shall be given to the counsel for the 
accused and not to the accused. For reference, section 14  of the 
Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021, is being reproduced 
below:- 
“14. Statement under section 164 of the Code.— (1) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time 
being in force, as soon as practicable, a statement of the victim 
shall be recorded under section 164 of the Code only once 
Explanation:— The statement under this sub-section shall be video-
recorded, preserved and reduced in writing. 
(2) An opportunity of cross examining the victim shall be given 
to the counsel for the accused and not the accused himself, or 
the Court may itself put questions to the victim or any questions 
framed by the accused may be given to the presiding officer of the 
Court who may put such questions, as found appropriate by him, to 
the victim.” (emphasis supplied) 
 
The provisions of section 14(2) of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and 
Trial) Act, 2021, are unambiguous in their meaning and are 
mandatory in nature, as the word “shall” has been used in the same 
and it has been made mandatory that an opportunity to cross examine 

5 
Writ Petition No.16927 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
the victim shall be given to the counsel for the accused and not to the 
accused.  It is settled law that when the word 'shall' is used in a 
provision of law, it is to be construed in its ordinary grammatical 
meaning and normally the use of word 'shall' by the legislature brands 
a provision as mandatory. The ultimate test to determine whether a 
provision is mandatory or directory is that of ascertaining the 
legislative intent. While the use of the word 'shall' is not the sole 
factor which determines the mandatory or directory nature of a 
provision, it is certainly one of the indicators of legislative intent. 
Other factors include the presence of penal consequences in case of 
non-compliance, but perhaps the clearest indicator is the object and 
purpose of the statute and the provision in question. It is the duty of 
the Court to garner the real intent of the legislature as expressed in the 
law itself. Reference may be made to the cases of The Collector of 
Sales Tax, Gujranwala and others v. Messrs Super Asia Mohammad 
Din and Sons and others (2017 SCMR 1427), Haji Abdul Karim 
and others Versus Messrs Florida Builders (Pvt) Limited( P L D 
2012 Supreme Court 247), Province of Punjab through Secretary, 
Excise and Taxation Department, Lahore and others v. Murree 
Brewery Company Limited and another (2021 SCMR 305),  Syed 
Zia Haider Rizvi and others v. Deputy Commissioner of Wealth Tax, 
Lahore and others (2011 SCMR 420), In Re. Presidential Election, 
1974 (AIR 1974 SC 1682), Lachmi Narain v. Union of India (AIR 
1976 SC 714) and Dinesh Chandra Pandey v. High Court of Madhya 
Pradesh and another [(2010) 11 SCC 500] The use of the word 'shall' 

6 
Writ Petition No.16927 of 2023 
 
 
 
 
is a strong indicator that the provisions of section 14(2) of the Anti-
Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021 are mandatory in nature. 
Another aspect of the matter is that when a statute requires that a thing 
should be done in a particular manner or form, it has to be done in 
such manner. The non-compliance of a mandatory provision would 
invalidate such an act. In this context, reference may be made to the 
cases of Rubber House v. Excellisor Needle Industries Pvt. Ltd. (AIR 
1989 SC 1160), Mall Development (Pvt.) Ltd Versus Waleed 
Khanzada and others ( 2022 S C M R 2080) and Messrs Tri-Star 
Industries (Pvt.) Limited Versus Trisa Burstenfabrik Ag Triengen and 
another (2023  SCMR  1502).  
 
6.            In view of the above discussion, the instant petition is 
allowed in the terms that the learned Magistrate, Mianchannu shall 
summon Aliza Rashid (respondent No.7),  the victim of the case F.I.R 
No.530 of 2023 registered at Police Station Saddar Mianchannu, 
District Khanewal and provide one opportunity of cross-examining 
her to the learned counsel for the petitioner and if the learned 
counsel for the petitioner does not avail that opportunity, then the 
matter will end there. In this regard, it is further directed that the 
learned Magistrate, Mianchannu shall issue notices to be served upon 
Aliza Rashid (respondent No.7),  the victim of the case F.I.R No.530 
of 2023 registered at Police Station Saddar Mianchannu, District 
Khanewal, to appear before him on 16.11.2023 and the learned 
counsel for the petitioner shall cross examine her on the said date. The

Magistrate Mianchannu for information.
