Tariq Saleem Sheikh, J. – Respondent No.3 filed an 
application under section 22-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, 
before the Ex-officio Justice of Peace, Jhang, stating that he had close 
relations with Salman Mushtaq (the Petitioner). About three years ago, 
the Petitioner told him he knew a public servant in the Civil Secretariat 
who could get him appointed as a Senior Clerk in the Civil Secretariat, 
Lahore. Respondent No.3 stated that he settled the deal at Rs.150,000/- 
and paid Rs.100,000/- to the Petitioner upfront while the remaining sum 
was payable on completing the job. In January 2019, the Petitioner 
handed him Office Order No. NAC/PF-831/2010/24360 dated 
18.01.2019 in the District Courts at Jhang, after which he paid him the 
remaining Rs.50,000/-. Muhammad Atif Iqbal and Muhammad Amir 
Khan were present during both transactions. The said Office Order was 
later found fake. Respondent No.3 contended that the Petitioner had 
committed a cognizable offence and prayed for a directive to the 
Respondent Station House Officer to register an FIR against him. The 
Ex-officio Justice of Peace accepted his application vide order dated

23.09.2022. The Petitioner has challenged that order through this 
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, 1973 (the “Constitution). 
2. 
 
The Petitioner denies the allegation levelled by Respondent 
No.3 and terms it mala fide and baseless. However, in his report dated 
16.09.2022, the S.P. (Investigation)/District Complaint Officer, Jhang, 
has supported the version of Respondent No.3, except that he had 
exaggerated the amount. According to him, he paid Rs.50,000/- for the 
task, not Rs.150,000/- as alleged. 
Discussion

There is no universal definition of bribery. However, all the 
definitions agree that it involves someone in a position voluntarily 
breaching the trust in exchange for a benefit. That benefit may not 
necessarily involve cash. It can take various forms, such as extravagant 
gifts, hospitality, expenses, access to riches, or a favour for a relative, 
friend, or favoured cause.1 Transparency International defines bribery as 
“the offering, promising, giving, accepting or soliciting of an advantage 
as an inducement for an action which is illegal, unethical or a breach of 
trust.”2 Bribery may be active or passive. “When a person offers, 
promises or gives a bribe, it is called ‘active bribery’; and when a person 
requests, receives or accepts a bribe, it is called ‘passive bribery’.”3 
4. 
 
“Bribery” 
is sometimes 
used 
interchangeably 
with 
“corruption”. Corruption includes any illegitimate use of office and may 
include various types of crime. In contrast, bribery is limited to giving or 
accepting payment or other unlawful advantages. The World Bank 
defines “corruption” as the “abuse of public power for private benefit.”4 
5. 
 
Bribery and corruption can have devastating socio-
economic impacts. It affects the availability, quality, and accessibility of 
human rights-related goods and services. Moreover, it undermines the

functioning and legitimacy of institutions and processes, the rule of law, 
and ultimately, the State itself.5 According to the International Monetary 
Fund, corruption increases public spending while decreasing government 
revenue. As a result, it makes it more difficult for the government to 
adopt sound budgetary policies and leads to bigger fiscal deficits. As 
corruption permits powerful people to profit from government actions at 
the expense of the rest of society, it fosters economic disparity. It also 
inhibits economic growth by distorting markets and resource allocation.6

Islam condemns bribery and corruption. In Surah Baqara, 
Verse 188, the Quran commands: 
 
And do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly or send it 
[in bribery] to the rulers in order that [they might aid] you [to] 
consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin, while you 
know [it is unlawful]. 
  
 
In a Hadith narrated by Abdullah ibn Amr, the  
Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 
 
Allah’s Messenger cursed the one who bribes and the one who takes 
bribes. [Abu Dawud – 3580].

Corruption is found in all countries – big and small, rich 
and poor. Lately, the international community has started focusing on it. 
OECD Anti-Bribery Convention (1997)7 makes it a crime for companies 
and individuals to pay bribes to foreign public officials. UN Convention 
Against Corruption (2003) covers five main areas: preventive measures, 
criminalization and law enforcement, international cooperation, asset 
recovery, and technical assistance and information exchange. The 
Convention addresses many forms of corruption, including bribery, 
trading in influence, abuse of functions, and various acts of corruption in 
the private sector. It has a dedicated chapter on asset recovery which

another landmark instrument.

It is difficult to detect bribery offences because they are 
secretive, and there is no immediate victim in the traditional common 
law sense. Therefore, the fight against bribery must begin with an 
efficient legal framework and adequately trained investigators. The links 
to other economic and financial crimes, and the corresponding capacity 
and skills required by investigators and prosecutors, such as forensic 
accounting, electronic evidence analysis, and cross-border information 
sharing, present additional challenges in investigating bribery.9 Pakistan 
ratified the UNCAC on 31 August 2007. Although we have enacted 
several laws to curb corruption, according to the 2021 Corruption 
Perceptions Index reported by Transparency International, Pakistan is 
the 140 least corrupt nation out of 180 countries.10 Pakistan must take 
quick corrective action. 
9. 
 
At common law, the term “accomplice” was understood 
broadly to include principals in every degree and accessories to the 
crime. Anyone who “receives, relieves, comforts or assists” an offender 
was regarded as having participated in his offence and deserved virtually 
the same penalty as he did. Michael Allen states that while the 
consequence of conviction as a principal or as an accessory is the same, 
it is important to distinguish them in some circumstances. The mens rea 
required of the accessory differs from that of the principal, and mens rea 
must always be proven, even when the principal’s offence is one of strict 
liability.11  
10. 
 
There are several crimes which cannot be committed 
without the concurrent act or cooperation of two or more people. A 
person is an accomplice if his participation is corrupt and criminal. In

People v. Coffey, (1911) 161 Cal. 433 [119 p.901, 39 L.R.A.N.S. 704], 
the California Supreme Court explained: 
“To the crime of seduction, two parties are necessary, but the 
cooperation of the seduced is not criminal. She is a victim and is not, 
therefore, an accomplice of the seducer … In cases of abortion, where 
the law denounces the commission of abortion, some cases hold that 
the consenting pregnant woman is not an accomplice. These decisions 
doubtless arise in part out of a tenderness for the sex and a 
consideration of the extreme temptations by which a woman so 
situated may be beset. Under our law, a woman may or may not be an 
accomplice, depending upon her part in the transaction. Thus, she 
may consent to taking the drugs or the performance of the operation 
in ignorance of the intended purpose. She may, indeed, be coerced 
into submission, in neither of which cases would she be an 
accomplice. But if a woman voluntarily solicits the performance of 
such an operation upon herself and to that extent induces it, it is 
impossible to see how she can fail to have been an instigator and 
encourager of the crime and so an accomplice … In adultery and 
fornication, where the willing consent of the woman is proven or 
assumed, the courts have found no difficulty in declaring her to be an 
accomplice of the man. For there, differing from abortion, no 
considerations of the temptation of the woman’s hard lot operate to 
soften the courts’ views. They are accomplices the one with the other 
because their conduct is corrupt, and each has mutually aided the 
other in committing a crime to which the corrupt participation of the 
two is necessary.”  
11. 
 
Here, for completeness, it may be pertinent to look at the 
effect of withdrawal from the joint enterprise. Allen states that if A has 
encouraged D to commit an offence, or is present assisting D to commit 
an offence, A’s withdrawal from the enterprise before the offence is 
committed will not affect his liability for incitement or conspiracy or 
attempt where the principal has reached the stage of a “more than merely 
preparatory act” before A withdraws. Actual withdrawal from the 
enterprise must be effective if A is to escape liability for the completed 
offence. A mere change of heart without more is not sufficient. 
Moreover, where practicable and reasonable, the communication must 
be timely and serve unequivocal notice upon the other party to the 
common unlawful cause. If he proceeds upon it, he does so without the 
further aid and assistance of those who withdraw. However, such 
communication may not be necessary where violence is spontaneous 
rather than pre-planned. The intention to withdraw may be ascertained 
from the party’s/accessory’s conduct or the words spoken at the relevant 
time.12

In view of the law discussed above, the parties to any 
criminal agreement are accomplices if the deal constitutes a crime. 
Conspiracies are typical examples of arrangements that constitute crimes 
themselves. All the conspirators are principals as well as accomplices. 
13. 
 
At common law, the giver and receiver of the bribe are 
principals in the crime and thus accomplices of each other. The giving 
and the receiving are reciprocal.13 In People v. Coffery, the defendant 
(Coffey) was convicted for receiving a bribe in granting a franchise for 
an overhead trolley system to the United Railroads of San Francisco. 
The principal witness for the prosecution was Gallagher, himself a 
supervisor, who testified under a promise of immunity, i.e., as an 
approver. He swore that he acted as the intermediary of Ruef and 
influenced the board members in relation to the corrupt bargain. The 
question of law raised before the California Supreme Court was whether 
Gallagher was an accomplice of Coffey in the corrupt agreement and 
whether his testimony could be relied upon without corroboration. The 
Court ruled that he was indeed an accomplice. It reasoned: 
“The charge against this defendant, as we have seen, is under section 
165 of the Penal Code. It is not for asking or soliciting a bribe. It is 
for “agreeing” to receive and “receiving” a bribe. The agreement 
necessarily carries with it the essential concept of a criminal and 
corrupt bargain. There can be no agreement without a meeting of 
minds, and a meeting of minds for this base bargain is declared to be a 
crime. There is nothing in the law to suggest even that in such a 
crime, the two parties stand in any different position from that 
occupied by two who agree to fight a duel. In such an agreement, the 
act of the person who contracts to pay the consideration is admittedly 
base, corrupt, and criminal. Moreover, his conduct is essential to the 
very existence of the crime of agreeing. How, then, shall it be said 
that he is not, within the narrowest or the fullest meaning of the law, 
an accomplice of the man agreeing to take the bribe? He is an actual 
participant in the crime, as well as an aider, abettor, adviser, and 
encourager in its commission, for it is to be remembered that in the 
case at bar the crime itself is the agreement. An officer may solicit 
bribes, may ask for bribes, and may advertise his willingness to accept 
bribes. Each of these acts is a separate, distinct, and recognized crime, 
but no one of them is the crime of agreeing to take a bribe, which ex 
vitermini requires the guilty cooperation of another. (United States v. 
Deitrich, page 451 126 Fed. 664.) Moreover, since, as we have seen, 
by all of the authorities, saving one, when the bribery is completed, 
the payer of the bribe and the recipient of the bribe are reciprocally 
accomplices in the bribing, it cannot successfully be argued that in the 
perfected agreement for the accomplishment of this crime the same 
two persons are not accomplices.”

As adumbrated, our country has several laws to curb 
corruption and corrupt practices. Since the general law, Pakistan Penal 
Code, 1860 (“PPC”), applies to the present case, I would confine my 
discussion to it. Section 161 PPC makes it an offence for a public 
servant to take gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of 
an official act. Section 162 seeks to punish anyone who accepts or 
obtains, or attempts to take illegal gratification to influence any public 
servant in performing his functions. Section 163 criminalizes obtaining 
and attempting to obtain gratification for exercising personal influence 
with a public servant. Section 165 prohibits and punishes a public 
servant who accepts, or attempts to get a valuable thing, without 
consideration, from a person concerned in a proceeding or business 
transacted by such public servant. Sections 164 and 165-A criminalize 
abetment of the offences under sections 162, 163, and 165. Section  
165-B PPC excludes certain abettors. It states that a person shall be 
deemed not to have committed an offence under section 161 or 165 PPC 
if he is induced, compelled, coerced or intimidated to offer or give graft, 
or any valuable thing without consideration, or for inadequate 
consideration, to a public servant. 
15. 
 
In law, an abettor is a person, who knowingly and 
voluntarily, aids another in committing a crime and thus becomes 
equally liable for it. An abettor is one type of accomplice, the other 
being an accessory who helps the criminal before or after the crime.14 
“The terms accessory and abettor derive from the English common law, 
which distinguished between accomplices and principals in assessing 
guilt for a crime. (An abettor was also known in the common law as a 
principal in the second degree.) Modern statutes abolish these 
differences and consider all accomplices as principals. It is no longer 
necessary to prove which kind of accomplice a person is or to find the 
principal guilty before the accomplice can be convicted.”15 A person 
may be punished as a principal when a crime has been committed, and 
he is proven to have assisted in its conduct.

In Pakistan Penal Code, Chapter V deals with abetment. It 
expressly recognizes that the bribe-giver is an abettor in the bribery 
offence. The Explanation to section 109 PPC states that “an act or 
offence is said to be committed in consequence of the abetment, when it 
is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the 
conspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment.” Illustration 
(a) to section 109 reads as follows: 
“(a) 
A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing 
A some favour in the exercise of B’s official functions. B accepts the 
bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161.” 
17. 
 
One may also refer to Chapter IX-A of PPC. Section 171-B 
PPC read with section 171-E sanctions bribery in elections. Sub-section 
(2) of section 171-B states that any person who offers, agrees to give, 
offers, or attempts to procure gratification shall be deemed to give 
gratification. Interestingly, where mens rea can be established, even 
treating is considered bribery. The Explanation to section 171-E 
elucidates that “treating” means the type of bribery where the 
gratification consists of food, drink, entertainment, or provision. 
18. 
 
According to the Explanation to section 109 PPC 
reproduced above,  an act or offence is also considered to be a result of 
abetment when it is committed in pursuance of a conspiracy. The 
following excerpt from Corpus Juris Secundum (Volume 15) elucidates 
the concept of “conspiracy”: 
“[Conspiracy means] a combination of two or more persons 
intentionally participating in the furtherance of a preconceived 
common design and purpose is essential to constitute a conspiracy … 
one person cannot conspire with himself. Furthermore, there must be 
a preconceived plan and unity of design and purpose, for the common 
design is of the essence of the conspiracy. The mere fact that each of 
several defendants acted illegally or maliciously with the sumo end in 
view does not constitute a conspiracy, unless such acts were done 
pursuant to a mutual agreement … the mere knowledge, 
acquiescence, or approval of the act, without cooperation or 
agreement to co‐operate, is not enough to constitute one a party to a 
conspiracy. There must be intentional participation in the transaction 
with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose … 
no formal agreement is necessary; it is sufficient that the minds of the 
parties meet understandingly so as to bring about an intelligent and 
deliberate agreement to do the acts and to commit the offence 
charged, although such agreement is not manifested by any formal 
voids or by a written instrument.”16 
                                          
16 The Supreme Court of Pakistan cited this excerpt with approval in Zulfikar Ali Bhutto v. The State 
(PLD 1979 SC 53).

Pakistan Penal Code defines “criminal conspiracy” as under 
in section 120-A: 
120-A. Definition of criminal conspiracy.– When two or more 
persons agree to do, or cause to be done, 
(1) 
an illegal act, or 
(2) 
an act which is not illegal by illegal means, such an agreement 
is designated a criminal conspiracy: 
Provided that no agreement except an agreement to commit an 
offence shall amount to a criminal conspiracy unless some act besides 
the agreement is done by one or more parties to such agreement in 
pursuance thereof. 
 
 
Section 120-B PPC prescribes punishment for the offence 
of criminal conspiracy. 
20. 
 
In Zulfikar Ali Bhutto v. The State (PLD 1979 SC 53), the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan held that the offence under section 120-A 
PPC is committed when two or more persons agree to do or cause to be 
done an illegal act or a legal act by unlawful means. It further explained: 
“The essence of the offence of conspiracy is the combination of 
agreement. The agreement may be express or implied, or in part 
express and in part implied. The conspiracy arises, and the offence is 
committed as soon as the agreement is made, and the offence 
continues to be committed so long as that combination persists, that 
is, until the conspiratorial agreement is terminated by completion of 
its performance or by abandonment or frustration or however it may 
be. The actus reus in a conspiracy is the agreement to execute the 
illegal conduct, not the execution of it. It is not enough that two or 
more persons pursued the same unlawful object at the time or in the 
same place; it is necessary to show a meeting of minds, a consensus to 
effect an unlawful purpose. It is not, however, necessary that each 
conspirator should have been in communication with every other.” 
21. 
 
In Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State of Bihar (AIR 1994 SC 
2420), while dilating on the analogous provisions of the Indian Penal 
Code, the Supreme Court of India stated that where the agreement is for 
the accomplishment of an act which by itself constitutes an offence, the 
prosecution need not prove any overt act. Criminal conspiracy is 
established by proving such an agreement. In State through S.P. 
(CBI/SIT) v. Nalini and others (1999 Crl. LJ. 3124), the Supreme Court 
of India held that a criminal conspiracy is a partnership in crime, and 
each conspirator has a joint or mutual agency for the prosecution of a 
common plan. Thus, if two or more people form a conspiracy, any act 
done by any of them in pursuance of the agreement is, in legal terms, the 
act of each of them, and they are jointly liable for it. It means that 

Writ Petition No. 58123/2022 
 
- 10 -
everything said, written, or done by any conspirator in execution or 
furtherance of the common purpose is deemed to have been spoken, 
done, or written by all of them. This joint responsibility extends not only 
to what any of the conspirators do under the initial agreement but also to 
collateral acts incidental to and arising from the original purpose. Once 
the conspiracy’s goal is achieved, any further unlawful act, such as 
providing asylum to an absconder, does not make the accused a part of 
the conspiracy. 
22. 
 
The upshot of the above discussion is that, subject to 
section 165-B PPC, both the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker can be 
prosecuted. But can the bribe-giver reclaim the bribe money from the 
bribe-taker? 
23. 
 
English law has a longstanding aversion to claims based on 
the claimant’s own illegal or immoral conduct. In Holman v. Johnson, 
(1755) 1 Cowp 342 at 343, Lord Mansfield CJ laid down, as a principle 
of public policy, that no court will assist a man whose cause of action is 
based on an immoral or an illegal act. He stated: 
“No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action 
upon an immoral or an illegal act. If, from the plaintiff’s own stating 
or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the 
transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he 
has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes, not 
for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid 
to such a plaintiff. So, if the plaintiff and defendant were to change 
sides, and the defendant was to bring his action against the plaintiff, 
the latter would then have the advantage of it; for where both are 
equally in fault, potior est conditio defendentis.”17 
24. 
 
Even after more than 240 years, Lord Mansfield’s above 
dictum remains one of the most authoritative pronouncements of the law 
                                          
17 The complete Latin maxim is: “in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis”, which literally 
means “where both parties are equally in the wrong the position of the defendant is the stronger.” In 
Herbert Broom’s “A selection of Legal Maxims” (10th Edition), the maxim is explained as follows: 
The maxim, in pari delicto portior est conditio defendentis, is as thoroughly settled as any 
proposition of law can be. It is a maxim of law, established, not for the benefit of plaintiffs or 
defendants, but is founded on the principles of public policy, which will not assist a plaintiff 
who has paid over money, or handed over property, in pursuance of an illegal or immoral 
contract, to recover it back; ‘for the courts will not assist an illegal transaction in any 
respect’. The maxim is therefore, intimately connected with the more comprehensive rule of 
our law, ex turpi causa non oritur actio, on account of which no court will ‘allow itself to be 
made the instrument of enforcing obligations alleged to arise out of a contract or transaction 
which is illegal’; and the maxim may be said to be a branch of that comprehensive rule: for 
the well-established test, for determining whether the money or property which has been 
parted with in connection with an illegal transaction can be recovered in a court of justice, is 
to ascertain whether the plaintiff, in support of his case, or as part of his cause of action, 
necessarily relies upon the illegal transaction: if he ‘requires aid from the illegal transaction 
to establish his case,’ the court will not entertain his claim.

of illegality.18 Yet, because he did not elucidate what constituted an 
“immoral” or an “illegal” act, an “incoherent mass of inconsistent 
authorities”19 resulted, and sometimes the decisions appeared “arbitrary, 
unjust, and disproportionately harsh.”20 Finally, in Patel v. Mirza, [2016] 
UKSC 42, [2016] 1 W.L.R. 399], a case heard by a panel of nine 
Justices, the U.K. Supreme Court abandoned the conventional rules and 
adopted  “a policy-based” or “range of factors approach.”21 It would be 
useful to look at the facts of the case, which were as follows: Patel, the 
claimant, paid Mirza (the defendant) sums totalling £620,000 under an 
arrangement in which Mirza agreed to use the money to wager on the 
movement of shares using inside information. Section 52 of the Criminal 
Justice Act of 1993 makes it an offence to utilize inside knowledge to 
trade in stocks (for example, by betting on their movement). Therefore, 
this was an agreement to commit a crime. The anticipated inside 
information was not forthcoming, so the agreement could not be carried 
out. Patel sought payback of the £620,000 relying on the principle of 
unjust enrichment. Under the conventional rules, he would be entitled to 
restitution of the £620,000 because the money was paid for a completely 
failed consideration. Patel received nothing in return for his £620,000, 
while Mirza got £620,000 for doing nothing. Mirza pleaded the defence 
of illegality and argued that the claim should be dismissed and that he 
should not be required to repay the money. He succeeded before the trial 
judge, who applied the reliance rule, which states that illegality is a 
defence if the claimant relies on the illegality to make out a claim. 
However, his plea failed before the Court of Appeal which applied the

 22 Locus poenitentiae literally means “place of repentance.” It is also used for “an opportunity to 
repent.” According to Black’s Law Dictionary (Ninth Edition), it means: “(1) A point at which it is 
not too late for one to change one’s legal position; the possibility of withdrawing from a contemplated 
course of action, esp. a wrong, before being committed to it; (2) The opportunity to withdraw from a 
negotiation before finally concluding the contract.”

but for different reasoning than that of the Court of Appeal. By a 
majority of 6-3, the Supreme Court favoured a new policy-based 
approach to the defence of illegality. Lord Toulson gave the leading 
judgment with whom Lady Hale, Lord Kerr, Lord Wilson, and Lord 
Hodge agreed (as did Lord Neuberger albeit with some differences). 
Lord Toulson wrote: 
“[O]ne cannot judge whether allowing a claim which is in some way 
tainted by illegality would be contrary to the public interest, because 
it would be harmful to the integrity of the legal system, without (a) 
considering the underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been 
transgressed, (b) considering conversely any other relevant public 
policies which may be rendered ineffective or less effective by denial 
of the claim, and (c) keeping in mind the possibility of overkill unless 
the law is applied with a due sense of proportionality … That trio of 
necessary considerations can be found in the case law.” 
25. 
 
Lord Toulson considered Patel’s claim regarding unjust 
enrichment in light of the philosophy guiding the statutory prohibitions 
on insider trading that made his agreement with Mirza unlawful. He 
stated there was no logical reason why public policy considerations 
should require Patel to forfeit the money he deposited into Mirza’s 
account, which was never used for the purpose for which it was paid. 
This would be an unjust and disproportionate response to the illegality. 
Patel is seeking to unwind the arrangement, not to profit from it. 
26. 
 
Conversely, Lords Sumption, Mance, and Clarke favoured 
preserving the existing norms. They apprehended that the new approach 
would create unacceptable uncertainty. However, in his opinion on the 
merits of the case, Lord Sumption wrote: 
“267. … the parties were on the same legal footing. Both would be 
liable to conviction for conspiracy in a criminal court, and any 
difference in the degree of their fault would be relevant only to the 
sentence. Section 52 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993 is not a statute 
designed to protect the interests of persons entering into an agreement 
to commit the offence of insider dealing, and there is no other 
overriding statutory policy which requires their participation in the 
offence to be overlooked when it comes to determining its civil 
consequences.” 
“268. However, restitution still being possible, none of this is a bar 
to Mr Patel’s recovery of the £620,000 which he paid to Mr Mirza. 
The reason is simply that although Mr Patel would have to rely on the 
illegal character of the transaction in order to demonstrate that there 
was no legal basis for the payment, an order for restitution would not 
give effect to the illegal act or any right derived from it. It would 
simply return the parties to the status quo ante where they should 
always have been. The only ground on which that could be 
objectionable is that the court should not sully itself by attending to 
illegal acts at all, and that has not for many years been regarded as a 

Writ Petition No. 58123/2022 
 
- 13 -
reputable foundation for the law of illegality. This was Gloster LJ’s 
main reason for upholding Mr Patel’s right to recover the money. 
Although my analysis differs in a number of respects from hers, I 
think that the distinction which she drew between a claim to give 
effect to the right derived from an illegal act, and a claim up unpick 
the transaction by an award of restitution was sound.” 
27. 
 
The new policy-based approach is helping the English 
courts to apply the law in a way that is considerably clearer, more 
certain, and less arbitrary and provide a fair result. The subsequent cases, 
such as Stoffel & Co. v. Grondona, [2020] UKSC 42, and Ecila 
Henderson v. Dorset Healthcare University NHS Foundation Trust, 
[2020] UKSC 43, have provided further clarity to the practical 
application of Lord Toulson’s formulations.23 
28. 
 
The illegality doctrine is not aimed at achieving a just result 
between the parties. If the defence is successful, the defendant may end 
up with a windfall gain at the claimant’s expense.24 Therefore, 
Parliament has passed legislation allowing the State to confiscate 
benefits earned by criminal misconduct in some circumstances. It has 
made special provisions for some offences, such as terrorism, but the 
two main schemes are found in the Proceeds of Crime Act of 2002. 
29. 
 
The principle that no wrongdoer should profit from the 
commission of a wrong is rooted in antiquity. In the 18th century, courts 
in England frequently allowed the victim to reclaim the bribe money. 
Even Lord Mansfield, widely recognized as the father of the doctrine of 
illegality, did it in some instances. Smith v Bromley, (1760) 2 Doug KB 
696n, permitted a plaintiff to recover the money she had paid to a person 
to help her brother’s discharge from bankruptcy in exchange for an 
illegal consideration.  Lord Mansfield CJ wrote on page 268 of his 
opinion that, even though the payment was made for an illegal purpose, 
“on the whole, I am persuaded it is necessary, for the better support and 
maintenance of the law, to allow this action; for no man will venture to 
take, if he knows he is liable to refund.” Lord Mansfield followed this 
approach again in Walker v Chapman, (1773) Lofft 342, where the 
defendant, who was a page to the King, took a bribe to arrange a job for 
the plaintiff in Government service but failed. In the suit for the return of 
                                          
23 See note 21.

the money, he maintained that the action would not lie because the 
plaintiff was a party to an iniquitous transaction, “and that the law would 
not suffer a party to “draw justice from a foul fountain”. Lord Mansfield 
rejected the defence, holding that there was a distinction between a claim 
to overturn an illegal contract and a claim to obtain benefit from it. In 
Neville v Wilkinson, (1782) 1 Bro CC 543, 547, Lord Thurlow LC 
approved this approach, holding as follows: 
“[I]n all cases where money was paid for an unlawful purpose, the 
party, though particeps criminis, might recover at law; and that the 
reason was, that if courts of justice mean to prevent the perpetration 
of crimes, it must be not by allowing a man who has got possession to 
remain in possession, but by putting the parties back to the state in 
which they were before.” 
30. 
 
Subsequent judges took a different and stricter approach. 
However, in Patel v. Mirza, [2016] UKSC 42, [2016] 1 W.L.R. 399, 
after thoroughly surveying the entire case-law, Lord Toulson concluded 
that “bribes of all kinds are odious and corrupting, but it does not follow 
that it is in the public interest to prevent their repayment. There are two 
sides to the equation. If today it transpired that a bribe had been paid to a 
political party, a charity or a holder of public office, it might be regarded 
as more repugnant to the public interest that the recipient should keep it 
than that it should be returned.”   
31. 
 
The British rulers provided a general Penal Code for the 
Indian sub-continent. Both India and Pakistan adopted it after the 
Partition, and it is still in effect with some amendments they have made 
to address their domestic requirements. The Penal Code does not contain 
any provision for restitution of the bribe money to the victim. 
Nonetheless, both nations have passed laws with special provisions 
allowing the State to confiscate such money. Even under the general law, 
the criminal courts may, in appropriate cases, impose a fine equivalent to 
bribe money on the bribe-taker while convicting him to prevent him 
from unjust enrichment, a concept at the heart of modern law. 
32. 
 
Insofar as the restitution claims are concerned, the courts in 
India and Pakistan decide them on the basis of the Contract Act of 1872, 
another law they have commonly inherited from the British. The 
statutory provisions in both countries are the same except for a few 
amendments. Section 23 of the Act describes what considerations and 

Writ Petition No. 58123/2022 
 
- 15 -
objects are lawful. Section 24 provides that the agreement is void if any 
part of a single one or any part of several considerations for a single 
object is unlawful. Section 65 states, “when an agreement is discovered 
to be void, or when a contract becomes void, any person who has 
received any advantage under such agreement or contract is bound to 
restore it, or to make compensation for it, to the person from whom he 
received it.” 
33. 
 
Section 84 of the Trust Act 1882 is also relevant to the 
discourse. It provides that if the owner of a property transfers it to 
another for an illegal purpose, but that purpose is not carried out,  the 
transferee must hold the property for the benefit of the transferor. It 
further states that the same rule will apply where the transferor is not as 
guilty as the transferee or allowing the transferee to retain the property 
would defeat the provisions of any law. 
34. 
 
In Kuju Collieries Ltd. v. Jharkhand Mines Ltd. and 
others (AIR 1974 SC 1892), the appellant paid a large sum of money, 
including a premium called salami, to the respondent for a mining lease 
in 1950. The Mineral Concession Rules, which came into force on 
25.10.1949, prohibited salami. Subsequently, the appellant instituted a 
suit seeking possession of the leased property or, in the alternative, for a 
return of the money paid to the respondent. Meanwhile, the Bihar Land 
Reforms Act was passed, which rendered the appellant’s claim regarding 
possession of the mines unenforceable. The appellant, therefore, limited 
its claim to the recovery of the sum paid. The High Court ruled that it 
was not entitled to the refund of the salami because the agreement was 
void ab initio being contrary to the Mineral Concession Rules. The lease 
was also illegal on that basis. The learned Judge held that the appellant 
could not invoke section 65 since it applied only where an agreement 
was “discovered to be void.” In this case, the parties knew the deal was 
unlawful, yet they transacted. The Supreme Court of India dismissed the 
appeal, approving the High Court’s reasoning that the Contract Act 
differentiates between an agreement and a contract. Section 2 thereof 
stipulates that a legally enforceable agreement is a contract, but an 
agreement that is not legally enforceable is not a contract and is, 
therefore, void. Section 65 is to be interpreted in light of these 

Writ Petition No. 58123/2022 
 
- 16 -
definitions. It has two parts. The first speaks of an agreement that is 
discovered to be void, while the second refers to a contract that becomes 
void. The parties (or one of them) may engage in an agreement without 
realizing that it is not legally enforceable and come to know about it 
afterwards. In that scenario, the issue would fall within the first part of 
section 65. In contrast, the second part of section 65 relates to a situation 
where an agreement, which was originally enforceable and thus a 
contract, becomes void due to subsequent events. In both these instances, 
the individual who received any advantage is obliged to restore or 
compensate the person from whom he obtained it. However, where both 
parties knew that the agreement was unlawful (and, therefore, void) 
when they entered it, there was no contract but merely an agreement. It 
is not a situation where it is discovered to be void subsequently or where 
the contract becomes void due to future events. Hence, section 65 of the 
Contract Act would be inapplicable. The Supreme Court further stated: 
“The further question is whether it could be said that this contract was 
either discovered to be void or became void. The facts enumerated 
above would show that the contract was void at its inception, and this 
is not a case where it subsequently became void. Nor could it be said 
that the agreement was discovered to be void after it was entered into. 
As pointed out by the trial court the plaintiff was already in the 
business of mining and had the advantage of consulting its lawyers 
and solicitors. So, there was no occasion for the plaintiff to have been 
under any kind of ignorance of the law under the Act and the Rules. 
Clearly, therefore, this is not a case to which Section 65 of the 
Contract Act applies. Nor is it a case to which Section 70 or Section 
72 of the Contract Act applies. The payment of the money was not 
made lawfully, nor was it done under a mistake or under coercion.” 
35. 
 
In Kuju Collieries Ltd., supra, the Supreme Court of India 
also approved the following observations from the opinion of 
Jaganmohan Reddy J. in Budhulal v. Deccan Banking Company Ltd. 
(AIR 1955 Hyderabad 69), a case decided by a 5-member Bench of the 
Hyderabad High Court:  
“A person who, however, gives money for an unlawful purpose 
knowing it to be so, or in such circumstances that knowledge of 
illegality or unlawfulness can as a finding of fact be imputed to him, 
the agreement under which the payment is made cannot on his part be 
said to be discovered to be void. The criticism that if the aforesaid 
view is right, then a person who has paid money or transferred the 
property to another for an illegal purpose can recover it back from the 
transferee under [section 65 of the Contract Act] even if the illegal 
purpose is carried into execution, notwithstanding the fact that both 
the transferor and transferee are in pari delicto, in our view, overlooks 
the fact that the courts do not assist a person who comes with unclean 
hands. In such cases, the defendant possesses an advantage over the 

Writ Petition No. 58123/2022 
 
- 17 -
plaintiff – in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis. Section 84 of 
the Indian Trust Act, however, has made an exception in a case 
‘where the owner of property transfers it to another for an illegal 
purpose, and such purpose is not carried into execution, or the 
transferor is not as guilty as the transferee or the effect of permitting 
the transferee to retain the property might be to defeat the provisions 
of any law the transferee must hold the property for the benefit of the 
transferor.’ This specific provision made by the legislature cannot be 
taken advantage of in derogation of the principle that section 65 of the 
Contract Act is inapplicable where the object of the agreement was 
illegal to the knowledge of both the parties at the time it was made, in 
such a case the agreement would be void ab initio. There would be no 
room for the subsequent discovery of that fact …” 
36. 
 
In Tarsem Singh v. Sukhminder Singh (AIR 1998 SC 
1400), the parties to the sale agreement were not ad idem with regard to 
the unit of land measurement. The vendor meant to sell the land in 
kanals while the vendee intended to buy it in bighas. Thus, they were 
under a mistake about a fact critical to the agreement. The area of land 
was as much essential to the agreement as the price, which had to be 
computed on the basis of the area. In the circumstances, the agreement 
was void from the inception under section 20 of the Contract Act. The 
issue arose as to whether the vendor could forfeit the earnest money or 
seek the enforcement of the forfeiture clause by way of defence in a suit 
brought by the vendee for specific performance of the agreement. The 
Supreme Court of India ruled that section 65 of the Contract Act is based 
on equitable doctrine and nixed the argument that it would apply only 
when the agreement is “discovered to be void” or where the contract 
“becomes void” and not to an agreement that is void from the inception.  
However, in the penultimate paragraph of the judgment, it stated:  
“We may point out that there are many facets of this question, as for 
example (and there are many more examples), the agreement being 
void for any of the reasons set out in sections 23 and 24, in which 
case even the refund of the amount already paid under that agreement 
may not be ordered. But, as pointed out above, we are dealing only 
with a matter in which one party has received advantage under an 
agreement which was ‘discovered to be void’ on account of section 20 
of the [Contract] Act. It is to this limited extent that we say, on the 
principle contained in section 65 of the Act, the petitioner having 
received Rs. 77,000/- as earnest money from the respondent in 
pursuance of that agreement, is bound to refund the said amount to the 
respondent.” 
37. 
 
In Mohd. Salimuddin v. Misri Lal and others (AIR 1986 
SC 1019). The appellant-tenant advanced a loan to the landlord to secure 
the tenancy under an agreement that provided the loan was to be 
adjusted against the rent accrued subsequently. This agreement was 

Writ Petition No. 58123/2022 
 
- 18 -
unlawful because it violated section 3 of the Bihar Buildings  
(Lease, Rent & Eviction) Contract Act. The landlord filed a suit against 
the tenant for eviction on the ground of non-payment of rent. The High 
Court held that the tenant was not entitled to claim adjustment of the 
loan as the agreement was unlawful. Hence, he was in arrears of rent and 
liable to be evicted. The Supreme Court set aside that decision. It held 
that the parties to the contract were unequal. The landlord was in a 
dominant position, and the tenant could not afford to refuse him the loan 
even if that violated the law. The doctrine of pari delicto is not designed 
to reward the “wrongdoer” or penalize the “wronged”. The relevant 
excerpt is reproduced below: 
“To deny access to justice to a tenant who is obliged to yield to the 
unlawful demands of the landlord in this scenario by invoking the 
doctrine of pari delicto is to add insult to injury, and to negate the 
very purpose of the provision designed for his protection. The 
doctrine of pari delicto is not designed to reward the ‘wrongdoer’, or 
to penalize the ‘wronged’, by denying the victim of exploitation 
access to justice. The doctrine is attracted only when none of the 
parties is a victim of such exploitation, and both parties have 
voluntarily and by their free will joined hands to flout the law for their 
mutual gain. Such being the position the said doctrine embodying the 
rule that a party to a transaction prohibited by law cannot enforce his 
claim in a court of law is not attracted in a situation like the present.” 
38. 
 
In Sita Ram v. Radha Bai and others (AIR 1968 SC 534), 
the Supreme Court of India approved the following passage from 
Anson’s Principles of the English Law of Contracts, 22nd Ed. p. 343, 
which spells out the exceptions to the pari delicto rule: 
“There are exceptional cases in which a man will be relieved of the 
consequences of an illegal contract into which he has entered – cases 
to which the maxim does not apply. They fall into three classes: (a) 
where the illegal purpose has not yet been substantially carried into 
effect before it is sought to recover money paid or goods delivered in 
furtherance of it; (b) where the plaintiff is not in pari delicto with the 
defendant; (c) where the plaintiff does not have to rely on the 
illegality to make out his claim.” 
 
 
In paragraph 13 of the judgment, the Supreme Court further 
said: 
“It is settled law that where the parties are not in pari delicto, the less 
guilty party may be able to recover money paid, or property 
transferred, under the contract. This possibility may arise in three 
situations: First, the contract may be made illegal by statute in the 
interests of a particular class of persons of whom the plaintiff is one. 
Secondly, the plaintiff must have been induced to enter into the 
contract by fraud or strong pressure. Thirdly, there is some authority 
for the view that a person who is under a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff 
will not be allowed to retain the property, or to refuse to account for 

Writ Petition No. 58123/2022 
 
- 19 -
moneys received, on the ground that the property or the moneys have 
come into his hands as the proceeds of an illegal transaction  
(See Anson’s Principles of the English Law of Contract, p. 346).” 
39. 
 
The courts in India have dealt with the issue of bribery most 
commonly in the cases under section 138 of the Indian Negotiable 
Instruments Act 1881 (the “NIA”), which criminalizes dishonour of 
cheques for insufficient funds in the account. There are, however, two 
streams of cases in this regard. Some courts have accepted the defence of 
illegality while others have not. In Virender Singh v. Laxmi Narain and 
another [1 (2007) BC 530, 2007 Cri LJ 2262],25 the petitioner received 
illegal gratification from the respondent-complainant for arranging a job 
for his nephew in Haryana Police through high-profile political leaders. 
He failed to fulfil his promise and issued a cheque to return the money 
which was dishonoured for want of sufficient funds. The complainant 
filed a complaint under section 138 of the NIA in which the petitioner 
was convicted. The Delhi High Court acquitted him holding as under: 
“[T]he explanation in section 138 of the said Act makes it clear that 
the expression ‘debt or other liability’ has reference only to a legally 
enforceable debt or liability. Conversely, if a cheque is issued in 
respect of a debt or liability which is not legally enforceable, then, 
section 138 of the said Act would not apply. Section 23 of the Indian 
Contract Act, 1872, inter alia, stipulates that every agreement of 
which the object or consideration is unlawful is void.”26 
40. 
 
For the second set of cases, R.L. Sahu v. Moh Tahir Shekh 
[2012 (3) MPHT (C.G.) 69; 2012 ACD 981; 2012 (118) AIC 882], is 
illustrative. The petitioner paid the respondent money to get him a job. 
When he failed, he demanded his money back upon which the 
respondent gave him two cheques which were dishonoured. The 
petitioner filed a complaint under section 138 of the NIA. The trial court 
dismissed it because the cheques were not for paying a legally 
enforceable debt or liability. The Chattisgarh High Court set aside that 
order stating: 
“In the present case, first part of the agreement was not illegal, but 
when the respondent, with a view to correct himself, has agreed to 
return the money which he had received from the petitioner for an 
illegal purpose and issued cheques in favour of the petitioner, who is 
the victim of the first agreement, then it cannot be said that second 
part of the agreement is illegal, and the petitioner is not entitled to

take recourse available under the law for the wrong committed by the 
respondent. Therefore, petitioner cannot be denied access to justice. 
His position was not of pari delicto.”27

Pakistan, as adumbrated, adopted the Contract Act of 1872 
enacted during British rule, and it is still in force with some amendments 
made over time. As a result, sections 23, 24, and 65 of our Contract Act 
are analogous to their Indian counterpart. A Division Bench of the Dacca 
High Court considered section 65 of the Contract Act in Messrs P.K. 
Basak & Co. Ltd. v. Messrs Gossen & Co. Ltd. (PLD 1957 Dacca 233). 
The plaintiff and the defendant were both private limited companies. The 
defendant took a loan from the plaintiff but repaid only a part of it which 
constrained it to file a civil suit. The defendant denied liability. It  
inter alia pleaded that the plaintiff and it had a secret arrangement under 
which they agreed to split the proceeds evenly, whichever of them 
secured a contract. The amount of loan alleged by the plaintiff was paid 
by it to the defendant as its share of the profits of one of the contracts 
which they performed jointly. The defendant established its plea at the 
trial. The plaintiff argued that if the agreement was hit by section 23 of 
the Contract Act, it was entitled to recover the money paid in pursuance 
thereof. The Court nixed the contention holding as under: 
“[The learned Advocate], of course, did not specify under which 
particular statutory provision he sought to claim the recovery of the 
money, but, presumably, this contention is based on the provisions of 
section 65 of the Contract Act whereunder, when an agreement is 
discovered to be void, any person who has received advantage under 
such an agreement is bound to restore it or to make compensation for 
it to the person from whom he received it. We must point out that 
section 65 of the Contract Act does not apply to contracts void under 
the provisions of sections 23 and 24 of the said Act, for the latter are 
void ab initio and cannot be said to have become void or to have been 
discovered to be void. But even assuming that the provisions of 
section 65 did apply to such a case, the rule is not quite as wide as the 
learned Advocate sought to make it out to be. It is true that if the 
contract is not yet performed or is merely an executory contract, then 
one of the parties may resile from his agreement subsequently, and 
may, in such circumstances, recover money paid in consideration 
thereof upon the repudiation of the contract as upon a failure of 
consideration. But if the illegal purpose or any material part of it has 
been performed, then the money paid cannot be recovered; for the 
parties in such cases must be held to be equally at fault, and the rule is 
that, in cases where the parties are in pari delicto, the position of the 
defendant is always better.”28

After an in-depth analysis of the court decisions in India 
and Pakistan, I conclude that any agreement falling within the scope of 
sections 23 and 24 of the Contract Act is illegal and consequently void. 
If the agreement is indivisible, illegality impacts the whole of it. On the 
other hand, if it is divisible, it affects only the illegal part. If the object of 
the agreement is unlawful, it is void regardless of whether the parties are 
aware of the illegality. As a rule, which the maxim in pari delicto potior 
est conditio defendentis expresses, no action can be brought on an illegal 
agreement. The doctrine of restitutio in integrum, an equitable principle 
embodied in Section 84 of the Trusts Act, is an exception to this maxim. 
One must not construe section 84 of the Trust Act to override section 65 
of the Contract Act.  
43. 
 
The question as to whether the bribe-giver should be able to 
recover his money from the bribe-taker is quite treacherous. In my 
opinion, the agreement to give the bribe and the one to return the benefit 
must be treated as separate and distinguishable, as held in the English29 
and some Indian30 cases cited above. A bribe-giver’s claim should be 
entertained only where the bribe-taker agrees to pay back, but not when 
no such agreement exists.  
The case at hand 
44. 
 
Having outlined the law and jurisprudence, I turn to the 
case at hand. Respondent No.3 alleges that he paid Rs.150,000/- to the 
Petitioner to arrange for his appointment as a Senior Clerk at the Civil 
Secretariat through a source who was a public servant. This accusation is 
sufficient to bring the matter within the purview of section 163 PPC 
because it amounts to accepting a gratification “as a motive or reward 
for inducing, by the exercise of personal influence, any public servant to 
do or forbear to do an official act.” It is irrelevant whether the accused 
was, in fact, capable of doing the favour or not. The offence is 
committed if the bribe-giver believes he can do the favour and gives the 
bribe.31

- 22 -
45. 
 
Respondent No.3 has also accused the Petitioner of 
fabrication of Office Order dated 18.01.2019, which attracts sections 
420, 468 & 471 PPC. The offence under section 420 PPC is cognizable. 
46. 
 
In his report dated 16.09.2022, the S.P. (Investigation)/ 
District Complaint Officer has supported the version of Respondent 
No.3, except that he has exaggerated the amount of the money he paid to 
the Petitioner. According to him, Respondent No.3 paid Rs.50,000/- and 
not Rs.150,000/- for the job. In this view of the matter, the Respondent 
SHO should be directed to register the FIR. Order accordingly. 
47. 
 
The Investigating Officer shall investigate the case strictly 
on merits and, in light of the law discussed above, also determine the 
criminal liability of Respondent No.3. If he concludes that he has 
committed an offence, the State may consider prosecuting him as well. 
48. 
 
This petition is decided in the above terms. However, 
before concluding this judgment, I may add that the observations on 
facts are tentative and shall not prejudice the parties’ rights in future 
proceedings.
